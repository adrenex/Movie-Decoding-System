23 November 2020,andrewchristianjr,8," FINALLY. SMART DECISIONS FROM OUR HERO.
",One of my fav home-invasion horror film. Intense. Clever twist. It's unique and even relieving to watch our main star make smart decisions. The whole film is executed with finesse and its pacing doesn't waste any of its minutes.,/review/rw3267122/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2015,Sleepin_Dragon,9," I totally enjoyed this film
","Over the last few years I think the slasher genre movie has died off a little bit they've stopped making unique and interesting movies, but this one was a little glimmer of light. A couple are murdered by someone disguised in a cat mask, later on their neighbours hold a large family gathering and the troubles begin. During a family meal the daughter's boyfriend catches sight of something happening outside and gets hit in the head by an arrow. The terror begins as one by one the family members begin getting picked off and a desperate battle for survival begins. 'We're all gonna die.' I've got to be honest I thought the scene of the boyfriend being shot down by an arrow was just brilliant, a real switch into scare and disbelief. There are some really grim bits, the wire line in particular, nasty. Suspense and surprises through to the very end, lots of violence, so if you are offended avoid. I thought it was a great film, lots of revenge, some great visual scenes, it managed to be different. 9/10",/review/rw3267122/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2014,m-a-elsewhere,8," More accomplished and satisfying than one might expect.
","YOU'RE NEXT is, unabashedly, yet another ""nuclear family and/or rich yuppies besieged by masked psycho killers at vacation home"" slasher, right down to the obligatory ""last girl"" element. But while the movie's schema is completely typical, its execution—smart script, decent cast, solid direction by Adam Wingard—is exemplary.",/review/rw3267122/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2015,claudio_carvalho,7," Brutal and Gore Slasher with Good Story and Twists
","Aubrey (Barbara Crampton) and Paul Davison (Rob Moran) welcome his family for a reunion in their isolated vacation house. Their sons Crispian (AJ Bowen) comes with his girlfriend Erin (Sharni Vinson); Felix (Nicholas Tucci) with his girlfriend Zee (Wendy Glenn); Drake (Joe Swanberg) with his wife Kelly (Sarah Myers); and their daughter Aimee (Amy Seimetz) comes with her boyfriend Tariq (Ti West). When they are ready to have dinner, they are attacked by a stranger with a crossbow, and Drake is wounded by an arrow and Tariq dies. They discover that their cell phones are jammed and they are trapped in the house. Erin tries to protect the house, closing doors and windows, but the masked killers murder the members of the family. Are the killers lunatic? What is the motive for slaughtering the Davison family? ",/review/rw3267122/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2013,SnoopyStyle,7," Weak intro, but good twist
","It's a family reunion for the Davison family. The father was in the marketing department for a huge defense contractor, and he's loaded. Erin (Sharni Vinson) is one of the son's new girlfriend. A gang of masked killers descend on the family, but Erin has a few surprises waiting for them.",/review/rw3267122/?ref_=tt_urv

31 May 2020,gimili3979,7," Watch the movie You're Next because of one character
","You're Next is your basic break-in horror film. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie even though the characters were rather basic throughout, with one huge exception.",/review/rw3267122/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2013,preppy-3,8," Very good and VERY gory
","This is all about a bunch of siblings and their significant others, gathered together to celebrate their parents 35th anniversary. They're all in a huge house in the middle of nowhere. The siblings don't get along and are arguing almost right away when they are suddenly attacked from men in creepy animal masks outside. The family is trapped in the house, their cell phones don't work and the men outside are intent on killing everyone.",/review/rw3267122/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2013,dfranzen70,7," Searing horror
","What starts out as a peaceful family reunion in a secluded home quickly devolves into utter madness and hysteria when a family is inexplicably attacked by assailants wearing animal masks. But the bad guys haven't reckoned on the tenacity of one of the guests - from outside of the family - who becomes a thorn in their sides (and head, and arms, and so on). You're Next is an unequivocal scare ride, impressive enough to make one forgive the occasional lapses in logic.",/review/rw3267122/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2013,Coventry,6," What the hell is mumblegore?!?
","Not even 10 years ago, all horror movie critics were full of praise for the so-called ""splat-pack""; a bunch of young and talented new arrival directors in the horror genre. Right now in 2013, we don't hear much anymore about most of this unofficial pack (including Neil Marshall, Greg McLean, Darren Lynn Bousman and others), but they seem to have been replaced with a new army of horror prodigies. Lately, all we hear about are Ti West, Adam Wingard, Joe Swanberg and Simon Barrett. Moreover they seem to be close friends, appear as actors in each other's movies and the type of films they make even received its very own subgenre name. Mumblegore, whatever the hell the characteristics may be. Do they really deserve this honor? Not quite. Ti West made a few worthwhile movies (""The Roost"", ""House of the Devil""), but their previous group project ""V/H/S"" was lamentable and this effort – released with a delay of nearly two years – is only just slightly above average.",/review/rw3267122/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2013,Red_Identity,," A Blast!
","Surprise of the day! You're Next is effective, gruesome, wickedly funny and twisted. I had a blast with this. It's not that original, but the way it plays with certain expectations is pretty refreshing, and the whole set up and the way the rampage starts is pretty fantastic. While it never takes on a full-on comedic tone like other horror films, it still takes great pleasure in giving the audience the most simple type of satisfaction. That's not saying it's not gory, because it is, and it's quite brutal. The actors are all pretty appropriate considering the tone of the film, and the twists manage to work. The ending also works in spite of itself. This is highly recommended, perhaps even better than The Conjuring.",/review/rw3267122/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2020,micahbboswell27,10," Surprising!
","I felt the same way a about ""Hush""; didn't expect much but was left thinking about the film days after I'd watched it. A must view for any horror fan. Check it out; you won't regret it",/review/rw3267122/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2017,Reno-Rangan,8," A messed up family, cleaned up by an outsider!
","This kind of films is usually low rated by me. It's very rare that I find one good film and that happened to be this one. I was braced for another disappointment, then I totally got surprised when it reached half way mark. Good twist too. In fact, there are many twists in the final quarters. Not like breathtaking, but very acceptable with kind of story and characters it had.",/review/rw3267122/?ref_=tt_urv

21 December 2014,Rickting,8," Effective horror which refuses to be boxed in
","2013 was another lame year for horror, but this and The Conjuring showed a standard of horror not often seen in modern times. You're Next is a straight forward home invasion thriller in many ways, but it subverts genre clichés. It's just a group of masked intruders breaking into a family gathering and starting a brutal, bloody rampage but there's a sting in this tale. Packed with unpredictable scare sequences and twists, You're Next should be next on any horror buff's watch list. YN has its scary scenes but its primarily an effective mix of gore and pitch black humour, which makes it more interesting than the typical horror flick. With an excess of the red stuff, a lack of genuine structure and some repetitive stuff, those who don't care for horror films will be more exhausted than entertained and this certainly isn't without flaws, but it has to be admired for its energy and use of humour.",/review/rw3267122/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2019,HorrorFanatic4Life,9," Real good slasher with lots of real good surprises!
","This movie started off really slow and sort of ridiculous. But man were there some surprising twists! And quite a few might I add. I was not expecting a whole lot out of this movie, so that may have contributed to all of the unexpected twists. But I was not disappointed at all. Sure it's not your typical fantastic horror movie that everyone is dying to see, but it is not worth passing up either. The acting was great especially the girl who played Erin. The storyline was spot on. And they definitely did not get lazy with the blood! There were also bits of funny moments, but it wasn't too over the top and somewhat subtle at times which was great. I was pleasantly surprised by this one.",/review/rw3267122/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2021,aidanratesmovies,9," Weaker parts aside, it's a really good movie
","A bland start thankfully leads to an incredibly fun time- You're Next plot and battle royale kind of ordeal was largely improved upon by more recent horror films like Ready or Not, but still manages to capture the enjoyment most horror films can only dream of. First off, the obvious standout about this film is lead actress Sharni Vinson as Erin who is as bada** and cunning as she is a great actress- and thankfully well written as well. Some of the plot points throughout the film can be a bit predictable, but onced the opening 20 minutes are over, the film is a pure adrenaline rush and you can't help but want to see what happens next- whether you know it or not. The look of the film is simple but well done, and the film's score is absolutely brilliant and unique. There is also a buttload of violence throughout the film which is as harshly executed as it is fun to watch- feeling almost like an R-rated Home Alone at times. In the end, You're Next is far from the decades best horror- but it does manage to be memorable and fun in a quick fashion- and is able to make something rather original out of itself despite its weaker parts.",/review/rw3267122/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2014,acidburn-10,8," A decent watch
","After seeing the trailers for this movie, for quite a while now, I was actually really eager to see this movie, and it's the first mainstream slasher movie that I've been excited about for quite a while and for once, gladly it's not a crappy remake. ",/review/rw3267122/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2013,rgblakey,7," There are some uninvited guests coming to this dinner party in You're Next
","The horror genre has continued to struggle over the years with only a few really standing out. For the most part they seem to be just rehashing the same stories or remaking stuff left and right as opposed to delivering something original. The latest You're Next has been sitting on the shelf for a couple of years, but is finally getting it's chance to slash its way onto the big screen, but does it live up to the wait and all the hype it received when originally screened at the film festivals?

11 December 2014,Leofwine_draca,8," Decent stab at a home invasion flick
","YOU'RE NEXT is the latest in a long line of home invasion horror movies, following on from the likes of the LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and MOTHER'S DAY remakes, along with the likes of THEM and THE STRANGERS. The good news is that this is one of the best instalments in the sub-genre, a tough and merciless thriller packed to the brim with danger and death.",/review/rw3267122/?ref_=tt_urv

29 June 2015,davispittman,10," An excellent and very refreshing horror movie!!
","Your next was surprisingly one of the best horror movies I've ever seen! It was written well, exciting, electrifying, and very smart. It didn't have any of the old slasher movie clichés, it was very unique and refreshing. Also it had not only one twist at the end of the film, but 2 twists, both were fantastic! Erin, the lead of the film was a great character! She wasn't one of those slutty cliché slasher movie girls, she was a really tough fighter who knew what to do, it was really cool to see a horror movie that did not have all the old clichés. All of the characters were wonderfully casted and well written! You honestly cannot predict the end of this movie, I'm not going to reveal the end because I want you to watch it and see for yourself because I sure you, you will not be disappointed. My only complaint is I wish it would've dialed down some of the gore, the gore wasn't constant and it wasn't terribly graphic but it was a little bit too much for my taste. Also at the very beginning there is a half naked woman that walks around revealing her breasts, just to let you know, just in case nudity makes you uncomfortable. I would've liked for one or two characters to be a little bit more attractive but it's not all about how attractive an actor is, it's about how well they pull off the roles and I can honestly say all of the actors in this film did a great job pulling off their roles! 10 out of 10 for you're next, if you're a horror movie fan this is a must see!",/review/rw3267122/?ref_=tt_urv
