23 February 2020,AGood,7," We Need a Viktor and Ivan Drago Spin Off
",This movie is not as good as the first Creed. It felt like a remake of Rocky 3 and was just too formulaic. However what made the movie for me was the final scenes where my appreciation of the movie changed by simply seeing the final round from the perspective of the Dragos and the aftermath of the fight with the Drago's.,/review/rw4477798/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2019,grantss,8," Great: continues in the same vein as the first movie
","Adonis Creed is heavyweight champion of the world. To defend his title, he accepts a challenge from someone with a very close connection to Creed: Viktor Drago, the son of Ivan Drago, the man who killed Creed's father Apollo in the ring. Ivan is coaching his son and is determined to win the belt that Rocky took from him. Viktor Drago is unstoppable and Creed's odds against him are slim.",/review/rw4477798/?ref_=tt_urv

8 May 2019,kosmasp,7," Drago(nian) measures
","The uber villain from the Rocky franchises returns. Whoever watched the original Rocky movies will not forget Ivan Drago - also known as Dolph Lundgren in real life with an amazing performance that is literally as 1 dimensional as possible and still or rather because of that is in one of the best Rocky movies made. So it makes sense for him to return here and to reprise his iconic role, training his son to take on Creed.",/review/rw4477798/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2019,classicsoncall,8," ""If you wanna give pain, you gotta be willing to take the pain.""
","For me, ""Rocky IV"" was the low point for the movie franchise, being it was cobbled together with a bunch of scenes from the prior three movies, loaded up with a resounding soundtrack, and having what I consider some of the most cliched dialog you'll ever find in any film. Oddly, ""Creed II"" follows some of the same pattern as 'IV', but works in a much more effective way by delivering new takes on the boxing angles and providing a human dimension to Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) and his relationship with wife Bianca (Tessa Thompson). Perhaps the most obvious similarity to ""Rocky IV"" was the desert training scenes that mimic Rocky's (Sylvester Stallone) intense preparation for the Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) match in the Russian countryside. That to be contrasted with Viktor Drago's more polished training regimen under the tutelage of his father, maybe not as technologically monitored as in the earlier film, but enough to demonstrate a contrast between the two fighters.",/review/rw4477798/?ref_=tt_urv

","Some poeple really liked it. But i guess i was expecting way too much from the film. The trailer was brilliant. And creed 1 was a much superior film. The film lacked soul. Everything seemed superficial and predicitable. Even the fight in the end was sort of a 10min montage. The Rocky series is known for its background scores, gritty action and is motivating. Creed is just a film without a backbone.",/review/rw4477798/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2018,dtnmusic,3," Shows how many fake reviews are out there
","Very MINOR spoilers. First of all, take a look at all the recent 10/10 reviews, and it still sits at 7.8. Do the math. Sad that studio's do that. Anyways, very lame story, way too much forced drama outside the ring. Infact, this is hardly a boxing boxing, it's days of our lives with a few fights in between. I almost walked out 2 or 3 times. 2 people actually did, out of 10. Basically every situation was forced and/or not believable, in a bad way. Next, Michael B Jordan does a horrible job of being the heavyweight champion of the world. Such a pansy throughout, in the ring, and outside. Get this, even as the son of Apollo Creed, even as the champion of the world, he has not one friend or entourage member. Reeeeally. All I kept thinking was, THIS guy is the same status/level as Mike Tyson was? This pansy who has no friends, no money, and goes to a diner with his girl after winning the belt? And the patrons, sort of care he's there? Oh and his woman, who sells out the Fillmore as a singer, doesn't get recognized by the black crowd. Cool. Don't get me started about her singing performance while walking Creed into the ring at one point. Ugg. I'm gonna get writer's cramp. I'm out.",/review/rw4477798/?ref_=tt_urv

","The first fight was better than the second fight.
Adonis ribs are broken again and he fights as if they weren't broken... very unrealistic and stupid hollywood fantasy.

4 December 2018,DomNickson843,," Completely unnecessary.
","This film is completely unnecessary just like the first movie. Adonis Creed is such a lame, cocky, unlikable character. In every fight scene he gives off that ""Jerkface"" vibe. I mean even the opponents in the first creed are rediculous and unmemorable. Everytime I saw the first ones trailer I was like, ""Why did you make such a cash grab of a series?"" It was basically a cloned tumor leaching off the success of the brilliantly written Rocky series. It wanted to be Rocky so bad but it sucked!",/review/rw4477798/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2018,krzysiektom,2," Must be a mistake
","Maybe i watched a different movie, because i cannot believe how good or even raving reviews this one is getting. I have found Creed II disappointing, with a simplistic and predictable script, full of cliches. At least the boxing and training parts should be good, but they weren't either. The boxing in this film seems more like street fighting, with boxers landing more clean punches within the first minute of the fight than Mayweather jr or even Tyson in his heyday could in entire 12 rounds. Completely unrealistic. And training for such an important fight in a desert? Please. The film doesnt say anything honest about the boxing business, we see here a successful US boxer living like a recluse, in a mediocre apartament, surrounded only by his one loyal aide and his wife, what about the usual entourage and swarm of people like masseurs, coaches, media assistants and publicists, financial advisers and groupies? What about the money and the financial motivations? Every top boxing fight is basically about earning millions of USD, in the real world. It is a simple film for the naive audience. OK if it was at least entertaining, but nope.",/review/rw4477798/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2018,tomek-sulkowski,5," Protagonist has no arc and an emotional development of 9-year old. I was rooting for Drago in this one.
","Seriously, Adonis has shown nothing but how needy and insecure he is. I didn't buy his change at all and really couldn't feel what was he supposedly fighting for in that last fight. Yeah he had a kid in a meantime, but he remained the same selfish brat.",/review/rw4477798/?ref_=tt_urv

",You have to give Sylvester Stallone credit--he has a gift for remixing the same movie over and over and again and making you actually care.

24 November 2018,Robert_duder,9," Living up once again to it's 40 year legacy
","Creed breathed new live into the Rocky franchise because it's less about Rocky and far more about Adonnis Creed. The best thing about Creed II is that it focuses so heavily on father and son relationships and what that means in three very different circumstances. Rocky and his son are estranged and Rocky doesn't know how to reach out to him and there is that father-son relationship between Rocky and Adonnis. You have Adonnis and Apollo, the son trying to live up to his father's legendary status but now also avenge his death and you have Ivan Drago and his son where he has raised this child in the shadow of his own failure. Rocky IV is generally considered the highlight of that franchise and certainly his greatest battle and this being a direct sequel to that makes Rocky fans happy and fans of the new Creed storyline happy to. It has deep drama and story, incredible action and intense performances. The scene where Drago and Rocky meet in Rocky's restaurant is complete perfection.",/review/rw4477798/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2018,Jared_Andrews,7," Ryan Coogler's deft touch could have made this great
","The best moments of 'Rocky/Creed' movies are the ones that make you feel something. Creed II contains a few of those-perhaps not as many as you'd like but a few.
Adonis ""Donny"" Creed (Michael B. Jordan) and Bianca (Tessa Thompson) continue to share charming, effortless chemistry, leading to a few of those moving moments. Other moments come ringside when Donny and Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) exchange motivating words as the music swells, our pulses rise, and we slide to the edges of our seats. These moments are present in Creed II, but they don't pack the same punch as they have at their best, like in the first 'Creed' or 'Rocky.' There's something missing in the buildup and execution of these moments, and I suspect that that something is the delicate touch of director Ryan Coogler and the originality of first film in the series.
Being the seventh film in this franchise, Creed II faced an uphill battle in the originality department. By now, we all know the beats and how the story arch is likely to play out. But this story felt like it should have been the first and most obvious one pitched in the writer's room and one that should not have been the final choice. It's tricky to describe what I mean without mentioning spoilers, so suffice it to say that we've seen this story before, and we all could have seen it coming this time. The story is made of 99% recycled material, which is something I like in plastic and paper products but not in movies.
On top of the major issues with the plot, there are a few puzzling details, like why is Rocky so poor? He was the heavyweight champion of the world for nearly a decade, Philadelphia made a huge statue of him, and he is instantly recognized by adoring fans on a regular basis, yet for some reason, no one has any interest in his restaurant. Rocky, hire a manager! You could be raking in millions each year if you had someone helping you out.
Another issue, and this one seems more pressing, is the confusing struggle that Donny has to find his motivation for the fight against Viktor Drago. Drago is the top contender in the world, and Donny is the heavyweight champion of the world. Drago is talking mountains of trash. Drago's dad killed Donny's dad in the ring. Those are all great reasons for Donny to want to fight him. I don't see the struggle.
Fortunately, Michael B. Jordan is one of the most charismatic and energetic performers we currently have in Hollywood. His vivacity infuses the tired story with enough life to get by, and he absolutely pulls off all the training montages, even though he spends half his time doing neck curls, for some reason.
In the end, we have the fight everyone wants. It's satisfying enough despite the mixed message that it sends about not giving up but also knowing when to throw in the towel because you're dangerously injured and could literally die in the ring. We live in a world where we know the dangers of concussions in sports and the devastating long-term damage that they have on the lives of athletes. I find it hard to ignore, which makes these brutal fights a little bit tougher to watch, and it makes the victory celebrations a little less sweet because the only way to really win is to retire healthy.",/review/rw4477798/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. The theatre was packed and I don't recall having heard a louder outburst of cheering for any movie moment. Was it predictable? Yes. Did it deliver what the fans wanted? Absolutely. Is it (as my son asked) ""ROCKY IV in 4K?"" Yes, that's pretty much exactly what it is. So despite CREED (2015) director Ryan Coogler opting to make BLACK PANTHER instead of this sequel to his own movie, I've seen proof that it's clearly a crowd-pleaser ... which is what the ""Rocky"" franchise has always done best.",/review/rw4477798/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2018,galahad58-1,7," Rocky Rehash
","Creed II is not a bad film, but you have seen it before. Creed II is a combo of Rocky III and Rocky IV. Just about every single scene is taken from the two Rocky movies. Creed wants to fight Drago, but Rocky does not think that he can win because Drago is hungry - Rocky wants to fight Clubber Lang, but Mickey thinks he cannot win because Clubber is hungry. Creed loses to Drago and then hesitates to fight again and has confidence problems - Rocky loses to Lang and has confidence problems. Rocky gives Creed the speak that gets him to admit his fears - Adrianne gives Rocky the talk to get him to speak his fears. Creed changes his boxing style to fight Drago - Rocky changes his boxing style to fight Lang. Creed goes to a new training facility that is tougher than his previous one - Rocky goes to a new training facility.
While it was a fun movie to watch - there was nothing original. It was Rocky III with some sprinkling of Rocky IV all over with a new boxer.",/review/rw4477798/?ref_=tt_urv

30 November 2018,kjproulx,9," A Rock-Solid Continuation to the Rock/Creed Legacy
","When it comes to the films in the Rocky franchise, you can pretty much predict how each film will end when the set-up takes place throughout the first act. This is both a positive and a negative that this franchise faces, due to the fact that the formula of these movies is about as perfect as you get when telling a story like this. When Creed hit theatres back in 2015, I was blown away in thinking that it was in the discussion of best films in the entire franchise. This was a tall order to follow in Creed II and while it doesn't quite hit every stride it needs to in order to be classified as one of the greats, I have very few complaints about this follow-up. This is the way you make a sequel.",/review/rw4477798/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2018,TheMovieDiorama,8," Creed II packs a punch and retains its heavyweight champion belt.
","The 'Rocky' franchise has spanned many decades, bolstering brutal fist fights and acclaimed scenes of cinematic showmanship. Much like its predecessor, this sequel eloquently balances the personal life of Adonis Creed and the exhilarating boxing matches, creating a film that feels more like a personal journey. A conquest in creating a legacy. Creed is now the heavyweight champion of the world, in which the infamous Russian boxer Ivan Drago let's his son challenge Creed, making for his most personal fight yet. Boxing films and most sports films in general are predictable. They follow a formula. Yes, this sequel is over reliant on said formula and loses the freshness of Coogler's previous entry, which remains superior. However, this is such an assured and solidly made film that I just couldn't help but sit there and get myself involved. A low blow to the rib cage? I punched the person sitting next to me. Struggling to get back up? I'm on the edge of my seat muttering ""come on! Get up!"". It's infectiously entertaining, and the reason for that is due to the astute focus on Creed as a character. His burning desire for Bianca as they start a family. His thirst for redeeming his father's name after Ivan killed him in the ring. Not only is he wanting to leave a legacy in the sports world, but also in his own personal world. Stallone's script and Caple's directing allowed an adequate balance of this, enabling every punch thrown to be of the utmost importance. And my God do you feel them! Jordan is a tank, and clearly all those months of training have been worth it. But Munteanu, a professional boxer, is an absolute machine. A beast of juggernaut proportions. Highlighting the ""David vs Goliath"" scenario that Creed must face head on. Performances were excellent all round, particularly Stallone, Jordan and Thompson. Lundgren reprises his role and actually does a decent job, establishing a delicate father and son relationship. Also, that final match made me sweat, profusely might I add. Exhilarating, energetic and exhausting. I need a drink...",/review/rw4477798/?ref_=tt_urv
