19 September 2005,lee_eisenberg,10," ""The Mask"" is, and forever will be, SMOKIN'!
","""The Mask"" was the movie that introduced my family to Jim Carrey. And we all thought that it was great. Carrey plays unlucky bank clerk Stanley Ipkiss, who one night finds an ancient mask. When he puts it on, he turns into sort of a cartoon character; think Roger Rabbit on acid. The really great thing about the movie is that they just turn Carrey loose. Anything that you can imagine him doing, he does here. A particularly funny scene is when the police tell him to freeze, you'd better believe that he freezes! All in all, Jim Carrey's humor will never get old. He may have given his all-time funniest performance in ""The Mask"".",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2005,BrandtSponseller,10," Incredible success when seen as a surrealistic cinematic pastiche
","Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a bit of a dorky pushover. For example, he buys hot concert tickets to try to get a date with a fellow bank employee he's been pining after, but she easily scams him into keeping the tickets for herself, and he is too weak to publicly object. But when he comes across an ancient mask of Lodi long ago discarded by Vikings who tried to bury the ""troublesome object"" at the ""end of the Earth"", he discovers it has the power to unlock his true self--suave, smooth-talking, manic, a bit dangerous, and a hopeless romantic.",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2007,mjw2305,7," A Fine comedy treat
","Carrey is on top mad-cap form in the Mask, he plays Stanley Ipkiss, a boring Mr. nice guy with a longing for more excitement and success in his life. When he finds a relic of an ancient mask, he gets slightly more than he could have dreamt of; he becomes a cartoonish superhero and at last he can live out his desires; or not!

15 April 2002,Special-K88,," one of Carrey's best
","Broad, inventive comedy stars Carrey as a repressed, down-on-his-luck banker whose once uneventful life is dramatically changed when he uncovers a mysterious ancient mask that brings out his innermost desires. After developing a close bond and gradual affection for a sexy songbird and prospective client (Diaz), he then tangles with her ruthless, lowlife gangster boyfriend (Greene). Lively, imaginative comedy with big laughs and nifty effects that almost make you feel like you're watching a live-action cartoon. The violence borders on extreme, but Carrey is in peak form and provides more than enough classic moments to make up for it. A must for Carrey fans. ***",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2007,Atreyu_II,9," This movie is a scream!!!
","If you ask me, 'The Mask' is Jim Carrey's best work ever. It's his best movie and the only one of him I find really great. It's not a movie without its faults, but it's original, imaginative, creative and has very good comical gags. It's a classic. Or, to use only one word to describe it: ""Smokin!""",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2004,DarthBill,8," Somebody stop that Jim!
","This was the movie that got me into Jim Carrey (though I'd seen him on ""In Living Color"" a couple of times), and it's still my favorite, though Ace Ventura #1 was also kind of funny.",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,9," One of my favorites in my DVD collection
","Remember back in the day with the hit TV show In Living Color had several stars, one of them being Jim Carrey. He was one goofy guy with crazy physical comedy routines that could get your stomach hurting from laughing so much. But could this man make it to the top and possibly bring in a number one movie at the box office? He did, with 1994's smash hit The Mask. I remember seeing this movie when I was 9 years old and being in the theater nearly dying of laughter. I wanted this movie so badly on VHS when it was released, my parents got it for me and I think I must have played it a few dozen times a day. Jim Carrey was like no comedian that I had seen with how crazy this guy would be and The Mask truly showcased his talents.",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2002,TheMan3051,10," Awesome!
",This is easily Jim Carrey's greatest picture! Not only that but in my opinion this was one of the funniest films of the `90s. This is such a fun movie that you can see it 10 times and it's still as fun as the first time. The film stars Jim Carrey in another amazing performance and the BEAUTIFUL Cameron Diaz in her debut. ,/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 1999,Spleen,8," How to cast Jim Carrey
","It's hard to use Jim Carrey in a movie.  He's very good at his rapid-fire mimicry routine, but how can it ever be anything other than a diversion from both character and story?  (Very rarely is it a pleasant diversion.  `Ace Ventura' was unendurable.)  And yet, what else can you do with him?",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," The Mask
","Extremely fun, fast-paced and colorful, The Mask is a movie with a good direction by Chuck Russell, a script very well adapted by Mike Werb, a beautiful story by Michael Fallon, great visual effects and excellent performances by Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz. Plus, it's one of Carrey's best movies and one of the best comedy movies of all time",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Hugely enjoyable comedy, and by far one of Carrey's better films
","I truly enjoy this film. It isn't the best movie ever or anything like that but it is still a hugely enjoyable comedy in my opinion. And I also think that along with Liar Liar and The Truman Show that The Mask is one of Jim Carrey's better movies. Here Carrey's role is split, his mild mannered banker and a wild, crazy superhero. Either way, he excels in this film, he is completely in his element and completely unpredictable. He is helped by the special effects, which are utterly amazing, a truly imaginative and sophisticated visual style that worked so well here. Here because of the special effects, Carrey moves around at whirlwind speed, pops his eyeballs and swaps parts of his anatomy for his cartoon equivalents and you know what it is jolly funny. There are so many good scenes though my favourite was the Bugs Bunny-style Cuban Pete routine. Also superb are the script, which is as funny and as imaginative as the film itself and the suitably tongue in cheek music score. Not to mention the adorable pet dog, underrated Peter Reigert, Peter Greene's Dorian and gorgeous Cameron Diaz. Overall, hugely enjoyable, funny and imaginative, so much better than its sequel Son of the Mask which I disliked so much I try to forget it exists. 10/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2019,doruksesli,8," Ignore the 6.9 this movie is SMOKIN'!
","I was in shock when I saw the rating of this movie was a 6.9 when it clearly deserves to be at least a 9!!!!! Overall this is a great comedy and is enjoyable ( also great fun for the whole family ), definitely worth a watch!",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2002,MovieAddict2016,7," S-s-s-s-mokin'!
","Jim Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss, a ""zero"" as the film tagline says, who never speaks his mind about anything. The typical mild-mannered guy.",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2008,sarastro7,10," Superlative superhero comedy
","Being a superhero comics reader, I tend to see The Mask primarily as a superhero movie. When I look at the best superhero movies yet made, the list of really good ones is quite short. The first X-Men movie was good, the Spider-Man movies are decent, and the best of the lot may be Mystery Men. I also like Sky High. But, one I frequently forget to consider is The Mask. It is actually just as good as Mystery Men, and so one of the two best superhero movies yet. It is a total comedy classic, also in terms of Jim Carrey's acting. Everything is done perfectly and for reasons that make sense to the plot, and it's just fantastically funny: ""I can explain everything!!"" ""Explain THIS!"" ""Ummmmm....""",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2005,jboothmillard,10," The Mask
","When I was younger this used to be a fantastic family comedy film, and it still is. Basically Stanley Ipkiss (Golden Globe nominated Jim Carrey is the mild-mannered bank clerk working with best friend Charlie (Richard Jeni), and one day he meets and is instantly attracted to the beautiful Tina Carlyle (introducing Cameron Diaz). They see each other again (after he has been soaked) at the Coco Bongo Club, and it is on his way home that he discovers an ancient green wooden mask inhabited by the spirit of mischievous god, Loki. When he puts this mask on, he is transformed into a green faced uncontrollable wacky cartoony alter-ego superhero. When Tina eventually meets ""The Mask"", she is instantly attracted to him and has no idea it is Stanley. Meanwhile, Stanley has to deal with Lt. Mitch Kellaway (Peter Riegert) who has reason to believe Stanley is this ""Mask"". Eventually, Stanley has bigger problems when Tina's villainous gangster boyfriend Dorian Tyrell (Pulp Fiction's Peter Greene) gets hold of the mask, and plans to take over Edge City with his new found power. The concluding scenes in the Coco Bongo Club, fighting for the mask, including dog Milo putting it on, are fantastically funny. Also starring Amy Yasbeck as Peggy Brandt, Orestes Matacena as Niko, Nancy Fish as Mrs. Peenman, Jim Doughan as Detective Doyle, Denis Forest as Sweet Eddy and Ben Stein as Dr. Arthur Neuman. The cartoonish special effects are amazing, Carrey is hilarious as The Mask, Diaz's debut is great, this is just a must-see family film. It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design and Best Special Effects. Cameron Diaz was number 65, and Jim Carrey number 47 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Diaz was also number 26 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and the film was number 68 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for Diaz's great introductory entrance. Outstanding!",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2019,bellino-angelo2014,10," Wonderfully enjoyable comedy, and one of the best movies from the 1990s
","I always loved this movie. It's not the best movie ever made but it's among the best movies from the 1990s and one of Jim Carrey's best movies that he has ever made. He was born for this role since he has such a rubbery face and he is very energetic movement-wise. Here he is split in his dual role of Stanley Ipkiss, at day a mild mannered banker and at night when he wears the mask, he unleashes his true self: The Mask, a manic cartoon-like superhero. Thanks to CGI effects that were new for 1994 movie-goers, Carrey spins like a whirlwind when he wears the mask and moves pretty much like a cross between the Road Runner and Taz. The script is clever and funny just like the movie itself and the performances are all best-of from the stars' careers. Jim Carrey is in his natural element and Cameron Diaz here in her debut is lovely as a mobster's girlfriend. All the supporting characters, including Milo the dog and the police detective, are nice to look at. And the soundtrack is one of those soundtracks that will remain stuck in your memory forever. All in all, a great comedy highly enjoyable and much much better than the wretched Carrey and Diaz-less sequel SON OF THE MASK, that I loathed it so much that I only try to forget that it was made in the first place.",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2020,baileycrawly,9," Incredible
","I grew up with Jim Carrey movies. They were always on TBS with regular marathons and encore performances. Of everything Jim has done in his career, nothing had quite the same level of appeal and immediate likability that The Mask did. The story of a relative nobody finding an outlet through which their innermost desires could be openly and fearlessly explored resonated with me a lot. The jokes landed back then and they're still just as good now. Carrey has every bit of the charisma necessary to tackle this role properly and he does it spot-on from start to finish. This is a fantastic film to showcase why Jim Carrey was such a huge success in the 90s.",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2013,SnoopyStyle,8," Perfect vehicle for Jim Carrey
","A mask with magical powers is released from an underwater chest in Edge City. Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a super nice meek bank clerk. This is the first movie with Cameron Diaz. She plays a hot bombshell who walks into the branch to open an account. It turns out that she's actually casing the bank. Then he finds the mask, and things take a turn for the crazy.",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2021,kosmasp,9," Hello Ms. Diaz
","Cameron Diaz ... what an introduction to the film world. While I reckon some may feel that her walking into this or how she is portrayed, is borderline sexist, you would be taking the fun out of the movie even before you started watching it. One thing is for sure: Jim Carrey is having as much fun as anyone can have. You can tell and it really comes through his performance and through the screen to anyone watching.",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2019,saghy122,8," It made me read the comics
","The Mask is a character you will never forget, and Jim Carrey was perfect for the role. It's simply one of the best movies based on comic books, I don't understand why did it get such a low score. It's also one of the best comedies of the 90s, you just can't go wrong with it.",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2005,mareksir,10," One of the greatest comedies I have ever seen
","Actually, I saw The Mask by accident. I wet to the cinema with my friend to watch something. When we arrived at the cinema and saw the poster showing The Mask we did not feel like watching it. But as it was a long way home we decided to go and see the film. And we enjoyed the movie so much that we decided to go to see it next day again. The first time we watched it we did not catch everything as our eyes were flooded with tears of laugh and our bellies hurt form laugh cramps. The story is really catching and Jim Carry is simply fabulous. The plot makes you think what it would be like if you had the mask and what you would do with it. Stanley Ippkiss in his funny quest made me be happy with what I am and what I have. The Mask is undoubtedly one of my most favorite comedies and it has a steady place on my video shelf.",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2017,stormhawk2021,10," Sssssmokin'!
","Classic of classics. Without a doubt, one of the best comedies of all times. It's a complete movie. The script is fabulous and the management even better. Chuck Russell in his best work gives us a series of unforgettable scenes, it would be impossible to choose one, but among the best could mention: the artistic number of the character of Cameron Diaz in Coco Bongo in the style of Rita Hayworth in ""Gilda"", scene of theft In the bank and the scene in which the Mask gives its deserved to punk-dressed criminals.",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv

","Jim carry at his best ! Cameroon Dias in a good support. A story fully loaded with marvelous sequence of becoming a God of Mischiefs for the best laughter's one ever imagines. Typical fictional story so convincingly portrayed that one forgets the logics and truth and would prefer a light ride through out the film. Very creative dance sequences, the dictionary idea explored to maximum.. No body in theatre would be non laughing.! It is difficult to make some one laugh. This film excels in doing it to the perfection. It has a great repeat value as well....",/review/rw5022972/?ref_=tt_urv
