31 January 2008,Quinoa1984,9," plenty of verve and style, and a (rightfully) perennial favorite of French spy thrillers
","Luc Besson was on a hot streak in the late 80s/early 90s, and La Femme Nikita (or just Nikita for short) is almost as good as he got at putting his own distinctive stamp on a genre that many auteurs have trouble molding. The spy thriller is great for blockbuster audiences, but to make it into a strong romantic drama is always tricky, as there's the chance for too much one-dimensional theatrics or more attention paid to the plot convolutions than actual human emotions. Nikita squares this problem away just with the protagonist: a young punk (Anne Parillaud, in her most recognizable, near star-making performance) who kills a cop in the midst of a shoot-out is sentenced to life, but then sort of resurrected following the lead of a member of a covert spy organization, and given an ultimatum: become a spy/assassin, or die. She complies, and in a few years time turns into Josephine, who gets orders on the outside from time to time to do tasks like dress up in a maid's outfit to serve potential targets, or to ready herself to kill someone long-range at a moment's notice.",/review/rw2416460/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2006,ccthemovieman-1,9," Parillaud Is THE Nikita
",This 1989 French film was justifiably so popular that an American re-make followed later and then a cable television series followed after that. ,/review/rw2416460/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2000,DennisLittrell,8," Accept no substitutes
","This, the French La Femme Nikita, directed by Luc Besson, is one of the strangest, most bizarre, yet psychologically truest movies ever made. The story on the surface is absurd and something you'd expect from a grade 'B' international intrigue thriller. Anne Parillaud plays Nikita, a bitter, drug-dependent, unsocialized child of the streets who is faster than a kung fu fighter and packs more punch than a Mike Tyson bite. She's killed some people and is given a choice between death and becoming an assassin for the French government.",/review/rw2416460/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2005,grendelkhan,8," Exciting, romantic, and stylish!
","I fell in love with this film from the moment I first saw a brief clip of it on an entertainment program. At first I was drawn to the action elements (being young and somewhat immature in my dramatic tastes), but I was blown away by the romance and character interplay. I loved the composition of the scenes, the noirish lighting, and the quirky humor. This movie, along with Pedro Almodovar's films, really opened my eyes to European films, particularly those with a signature style.",/review/rw2416460/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2018,bowmanblue,8," Ground-breaking assassin flick
","I think I probably watched this film at the wrong time. I first saw the American-language remake 'Assassin' back in the early nineties and have only just got round to watching the film it was based on, 'Nikita' (or 'La Femme Nikita' to be precise). Therefore, it's hard to accept that the French version is the original source material and not the remake. Both stay pretty much on the same story-telling path, telling the tale of a down-and-out, drug-addled young woman, killing a police officer in a burglary gone wrong, but eluding the death penalty in favour of working for a secret government agency to 'off' those who need disappearing. Yes, the plot is possibly a little far-fetched, but, if you can suspend your disbelief long enough, you'll find that it's well worth it.",/review/rw2416460/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2005,mstomaso,9," Brilliant, tense and artful
","Anne Parillaud is phenomenal as a terrifyingly vulnerable, beautiful and human young anti-hero with an incredible talent for violence. A drug-addict murderous teen is given a second chance by a government agency looking to exploit her penchant for conscience-less killing. Mentored by a man whose compassion for her is only matched by his ambition and Machiavellian sadism, Nikita ventures on a roller-coaster ride leading a double-life as assassin and clean-living young woman in love. Her passionate affair with Marco and the clarity of her un-drugged consciousness, combine to promote the development of a conscience - a dangerous thing in her line of work. Nikita is, nevertheless, a victim of her circumstances, and like the rest of the characters on both sides, seems stuck in a very bad situation. In addition to the artistry with which this story is told, this film has a very nihilistic sense of justice and not-so-subtly points out the fact that state authorized murder is still murder.

14 June 2017,seymourblack-1,8," An Amazing Transformation
","It's smart, stylish and violent with numerous well-directed action sequences but what's more surprising about ""La Femme Nikita"" is its preoccupation with character development and the effective way in which it changes pace at various points to meet the needs of its story. Its well-written plot describes how a young woman who begins as a drug-addicted criminal, is transformed into a more complex young lady who finds love and works for the French government as an assassin. The changes that take place as this originally hostile, defiant and volatile punk is moulded into a slightly more polished, disciplined and caring individual, are really entertaining to watch, not least, because of her unpredictability which makes the whole process so challenging, edgy and even on some occasions, humorous.",/review/rw2416460/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2016,Red-Barracuda,9," One of the high points of the cinéma du look movement
","I remember back in the 90's I had the iconic Nikita poster, which had a very leggy Anne Parillaud kitted out in a little tight black dress while cocking a huge hand gun. It was one of the definitive movie posters of its day and went some way in adding to the film's overall reputation as something cool that had to be seen. Over the years Nikita has become less well remembered but it definitely remains one of the high points of the French cinéma du look movement. It follows the story of a violent drug addicted young woman, who is imprisoned for killing a police officer during an armed robbery. Recognising her skills as useful, a secret government agency fakes her death and gives her the opportunity to be reborn in a new life as a professional killer.",/review/rw2416460/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2004,Galina_movie_fan,9," Femme Fatale
","Welcome to the world where a woman can handle a gun and be as merciless and seemingly unemotional as any man. The anti- heroine, a woman named Nikita (Anne Parillaud in a performance of her life) is given a reprieve from a death sentence by government agents that want to use her as an undercover assassin. Stylish, ultraviolent, cynical but strangely engrossing - this is a must see for the fans of clever action movies.",/review/rw2416460/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2011,ma-cortes,7," French thriller finely directed by Luc Besson about a violent junkie who becomes undercover assassin

4 May 2012,classicsoncall,7," ""The best ones always take more training time.""
","Admittedly this is a slick and stylish film, but in between the high spots, I found it to be long on exposition and dare I say it, almost boring. What was never developed well enough for me was the idea that this punk teenager/cop killer was deemed suitable to undergo an intensive rebirth as a government assassin. What elusive ingredient was part of Nikita's (Anne Parillaud) makeup that justified agent Bob (Tcheky Karyo) to go out on a limb to mentor her training? That whole part of the story was a disconnect for me, and kept rearing it's ugly head every time Marie/Josephine went into a sob over one thing or another. I offer that bathtub scene with the co-assassin who panicked to support my argument. I thought she was going to have a nervous breakdown right there. Well this one's been around a long time now, twenty years, and I finally got around to seeing it based on it's reputation, but I can't say that I was enthralled the way some of it's bigger fans on this board were. For some perspective, I went back and took a look at my review for that other Luc Besson genre film ""Leon: The Professional"", but that only confirmed my initial reaction here. The two hours can be spent better elsewhere.",/review/rw2416460/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2010,Dandy_Desmond,8," Classy thriller
","From the outset Nikita is a classy film. Luc Besson really knows his stuff and as I watched this film I could see the quality of character and direction he gives the movie. The lead actress I have read on here is apparently 'ugly' - well what does that have to do with the story? Did she have to be a hot piece of ass? No, she didn't she was cast as she is a great actress who was physically right and most believable for the role. Luc Besson is not interested in satisfying horny teenagers, he is making a 'proper' film that has stood the test of time. From the beginning the story grips you - Nikita is a teenage psychotic tear away with a group of friends equally as bad. After a cool shootout and the murder of a cop she is arrested and sentenced to life in prison. A story is fabricated that she committed suicide and she is given the option by the government to become their assassin or be killed. The whole first part of the movie is very strong, as Nikita develops from a miserable aggressive psycho into a human being again. Her relationship with her mentor is very understated and interesting. She is released into society again after passing her initial 'test' or first assignment. This is the real highlight of the film - a cool shoot out in a restaurant. Once back into society she meets a man and falls in love and basically starts enjoying life with a new perspective and value for her own life and that of others. However the government are not far away with more assignments for her. All this is still very entertaining, however as we edge towards the end I did feel it sagged a little. Her last assignment is not really gripping enough and I was getting a little bored, however the very end as the two men who fell in love with her meet just after she has gone on the run, is very satisfying and it stops at the right point to leave the viewer with an almost sad feeling. I like this film very much, the lead actress is brave, fearless and shows great range. I love the relationship with the mentor and the action is used at the right time. Apart from the end it would have been perfect. 8/10",/review/rw2416460/?ref_=tt_urv

","When it comes to spy cinema, Americans generally know it through franchises like James Bond, Mission: Impossible, the Bourne series, and... Spy Kids. Those films generally paint two portraits of the spy life. Either glamorous and exotic, or intense and brutal. Nikita is an interesting film in the genre. While it certainly leans more towards the latter, it's one of the very films in the genre that both shows a realistic depiction of spy life but at the same time, stylizes it. But does Nikita work as a film? Let's find out.",/review/rw2416460/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2008,FilmCriticLalitRao,7," A triumph for a concept movie
","Every time when a film by Luc Besson is released in France,it invariably ends up in the creation of a major event of unmatched intensity.This was exactly the feeling felt in France when Nikita hit French screens in 1990.Luc Besson is an important director in the history of French cinema.He is one of the few French directors whose works have been hailed by critics as well as viewers.If one states that cinema of look concept has been initiated by Jean Jacques Beinex, it must be added that Luc Besson merits a justified place in that category.Nikita is a complete concept film.Although it has its fair share of weaknesses but its strengths in many departments has made it a cult film.The weak areas are something about which director Luc Besson could not have done much as it is difficult to incorporate comedy and love story in an action film.A major weak spot concerns the role played by famous French actress Jeanne Moreau.Her presence was completely out of focus in a film dominated by major action stars like Tcheky Karyo and Jean Reno.The theme of love felt by the boyfriend of an ex junkie transformed into spy was also too hot for Jean Hughes Anglade to handle.This is one reason why nothing much can be said about the love chemistry between Anne Parillaud and Jean Hughes Anglade.The strengths of this film include its hypnotic musical score and taut editing.A couple of sentences should also be written about action scenes filmed in Nikita"".They seem to be the handiwork of nihilists hell bent on destroying the social fabric of a civilized society.",/review/rw2416460/?ref_=tt_urv
