13 March 2022,midnitepantera,6," Amanda manages to pull off the Creepiness of the Real Elizabeth! :O
","I watched a documentary few years back about Elizabeth Holmes Fiasco!! Basically Diary of a Selfish, Greedy and Dangerous Sociopath!",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2022,dfloro,6," Watch the documentaries instead.
","This may go against the grain, but I don't like Amanda Seyfried in this role. She's not creepy enough; you don't notice the unblinking stare, the artificially low speaking voice and the other prototypical Elizabeth Holmes traits as much as you should. Frankly, the real Holmes was hard to look at, listen to and take seriously, and all of it was supremely noticeable. (I say ""was,"" since she projects something/someone utterly different now with her age-appropriate, trust-fund-baby boyfriend.) Seyfried has mentioned that their script referred to Elizabeth 1.0 (pre-Theranos teenager and eventual Stanford dropout) and Elizabeth 2.0 (buttoned-up, automaton CEO), so I guess now we're firmly in the Elizabeth 3.0 era. The HBO documentary, ""The Inventor,"" is much better at giving a true picture of the Elizabeths. I give this fictionalized version 6 out of 10 stars.",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2022,paul-allaer,9," Surprisingly entertaining and insightful look at the rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes
","As Episode 1 of ""The Dropout"" (2022 release; 8 episodes of about 50-55 min each) opens, it is ""July 11, 2017"" and Elizabeth Holmes, CEO of the Silicon Valley startup unicorn Theranos, is in a court deposition, answering uncomfortable questions about whether/how she misled investors. We then go to ""Houston 1995"" as young Elizabeth is running track awkwardly. We then move to ""2001"" as her dad loses his job in the Enron corporate collapse.... At this point we are 10 min into Episode 1.",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2022,rallder19,7," A very high 7
","Wow.. this show is insane. I want to start off by saying that I know movies and shows overdramatize true stories so I'm speaking solely about the show right now. This goes from you rooting for the main character to you hating her.. like a real life Anakin Skywalker story.. IF this is close to what actually happened I would have been horrified to have been a part of this company. What a truly terrifying slip into ""The Dark Side"".... Wow.. just wow..",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,aarpcats,7," Seyfried Steals the Show,
",I was a banker for 40 years. I got my start in San Francisco during the heyday of the 1970s when guys with Beatle haircuts and plaid suits tried to upend the finance industry.,/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2022,jennfinn,8," Entertaining
",I watched videos of Elizabeth Holmes and I have to say that Amanda Seyfried's performance was spot on. I had no clue who Elizabeth Holmes was and had never heard of Theranos.,/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2022,ladyliliroche,8," Amanda Seyfried is amazing
","With the exception of the bad chinese (maybe that's also intentional, who knows), Amanda Seyfried is great at portraying Elizabeth Holmes. She looked like her, she got the weird and awkward manner, the deepen of the voice. You look at her and think that she is Elizabeth Holmes.",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2022,DukeEman,8," When success is more important than facts...
","We all know the story of Elizabeth Holmes, but this series details with great interest the ambitious drive that drove her to be a self-made billionaire, and stay on top at all costs. It is this passion that Holmes oozes that enticed me to watch in wonderment on how she pulled it off.",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,karinahatem,7," Well this was good
","Slow start, but things start rolling in e4. To better enjoy this show, once needs to be familiar with the Theranos story, Amanda did a fantastic job portraying Elizabeth Holmes, the way she walks, talks, make up, she even mastered the voice. She truly deserves an award for her performance. All in all, the shows was way more enjoyable, than the documentary made by HBO.",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2022,trademarcdesigns,5," Just doesn't ring true
","First of all, with Elizabeth Holmes awaiting sentencing later on this year, I'm not sure a TV series depicting her as a damaged PTSD victim is really appropriate - though I'm sure she and her lawyers are thrilled by it.",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,quaseprovisorio,7," not awesome, but its actually surprisingly good.
","I've seen 7 episodes so far. The main issue with this, is how quickly some events happen. They want to put too much information in a small amount of time and that is noticeable. Given that, i was pleasantly surprised: i followed theranos story, read the carreyrou articles and saw interviews with him, watched a whole bunch of videos... and still i can be entertained by this. They made it interesting to follow and it has a good pace. The characters could have been better developed in general, but they are fine.",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2022,h2223,9," Solid series, worth the watch
","I'm amazed at how we can all watch the same series and see something different. I, of course, think I'm seeing what is ACTUALLY there and not just what my bias is telling me, haha.",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2022,zkonedog,8," Worth It For Seyfried No Matter How You View The Material Treatment
","I came into ""The Dropout"" knowing absolutely nothing about Elizabeth Holmes or Theranos. Ultimately, I think this perhaps worked to my disadvantage in watching this miniseries. However, when all is said and done, it still ends up being a solid peek behind the curtain of what blatant dishonesty and false images can lead to.",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2022,UniqueParticle,9," Spectacular worthy of the 6 nominations
","I was curious about this for awhile and decided to officially toady cause I noticed it's up for numerous emmy's plus caught up on other shows I've been into. Anyway I didn't realize this is based on the real Elizabeth Holmes, I don't think my mom did either when she watched the series. The Dropout is brilliantly written and acted; amazing mini series throughout! Amanda Seyfeild is magnificent is pretty much anything originally watched her in Mean Girls that was an breakout role and the soundtrack is great!",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2022,genosypheus,8," not sure why the hate on Amanda Seyfried
","First 3 episodes in and i think she is a credible Elizabeth Holmes, mostly, except that she is way too pretty. Otherwise, her acting on this role works for me and largely keeps the grip on the show.",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2022,annlevtex,8," Highly Watchable With Great Performances
","This is my fourth foray into ""Elizabeth Holmes"" territory. I listened to the audio book of ""Bad Blood,"" by the WSJ reporter who broke open the story of Theronos' fraud. I watched the documentary. I skimmed the ""Bad Blood"" book version and now I am watching this version.",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,evan_lassi,7," Started bad but saved itself
","This started out on the wrong foot making Holmes look like a ""victim of society,"" couldn't catch a break, men stepping over her and sabotaging her. Anyone who knew anything about the story knew all of that was a bunch of bull and I almost stopped watching but gave it one more episode and from there on, the show told the story like it was.",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2022,toneybrooks2003,6," Very Interesting Series
","Wow. Lots of Amanda Seyfried haters here. Ignore them and judge for yourself. Frankly, she's a very accomplished actress and interprets this role with aplomb. I think you'll enjoy it.",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,cjonesas,8," [8.3] People praise and applaud first, then they start asking questions!
","A very good series with brilliant acting by the whole main and supporting cast, meticulous attention to details and atmosphere (on its own terms); starting slow, rising in the middle and falling toward the end, especially in the last episode, finished too soon and a little hurriedly.",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,aimee925,7," Poor interpretation
","Anyone that's been following this case for years will know what an awful representation Amanda Sigfreid has given to the actual E. Holmes. She was a cold, calculated, sociopath. This ""documentary"" is trying to paint her as a poor little, badly treated girl. Pathetic.",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2022,marymcfarland-01866,8," So Far...
","This is actually good. I never would have put Amanda in this role, but she's doing a solid job.",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2022,iemand-anders1,," Im just shocked
",Of all the raving positive reviews here.,/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2022,Maxax777,10," Fantastic
",I don't get it - but it's just impossible to stop watching!!! I guess it's like a train wreck - you just have to look! I think the whole thing is VERY VERY well done. Amanda nails it!!! She is fantastic in this role - along with everyone else! It's just a well made series about a complete disaster!!!,/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,donovandesign,1," How do they take a mind blowing story and make it dull?
",A terrible series. BORING and dull.,/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2022,a_nzj664,1," Nothing like the book Bad Blood
","I read the book Bad Blood before I watched this, and this is far from anything like the book.",/review/rw7977031/?ref_=tt_urv
