19 January 2019,Hitchcoc,10," I Was Captivated
","I saw Don Shirley perform in college in 1966. At the time I simply thought he was a hell of a pianist, using that bass and cello to come up with a unique sound. So when this movie came along, I thought ""I saw that guy!"" I know the critics are being hard on this film, but I sat for two hours, totally captivated. I know there are stereotypes. Could that be because the repeated actions against minorities and the actions of racists have become so commonplace they seem like stereotypes. I believe the performances of these two fine actor made the show. There is a subtlety to this movie that transcends many others of its type. Yes, there are Southern cops; yes, there are men's rooms that are off limits; yes, there are simplistic views of racism by white New Yorkers. But what I got was a realistic presentation of an evolving friendship. Shirley is abrasive and self-centered; Lip is clueless most of the time. And I believed in them. See this film.",/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Green Book
","This film proves why movies can be so powerful with a touching, poignant and some times funny story of opposites attract. Enjoyed every moment although it isn't always easy to watch. Mortenson and Ali shine and there are strong supporting roles as well.",/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2021,Sleepin_Dragon,10," A captivating watch, with sensational acting.

26 June 2020,Instant_Palmer,9," Ranks #5 on my IMDb Top 25 Best Buddy Films List. A Feel Good Movie at its Core
","Ignore the sour grapes criticism from Spike Lee. This was THE best film of 2018, and one of the best-ever feel-good buddy/road films. There is something very sincere about this film - it is understated in its messaging, and keeps the focus on the evolving bond and respect that grows between two polar opposite personalities. A well-made film, with first-rate acting, that makes you feel this good without feeling ""manipulated"", is a rare treat indeed. Highly recommended.",/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2018,taylor_king-890-815491,10," ""Green Book"" is Gold
","We loved Green Book along with the sold-out crowd who applauded loudly at the end. Based on true story of piano virtuoso, Don Shirley's road trip through the south during the 60's, the film pays tribute to his genius and courage as a black man who tries hard to soar above the ugliness of the times. The elegant trappings of his home and his success as a concert pianist leave him arrogantly cold and lonely, but his life begins to change when he hires Tony as his road trip driver. With a history as nightclub bouncer with Mafia connections in New York, Tony is the antithesis of Don's perfection and their evolving relationship on the road makes the movie soar above the ordinary and become magical. Viggo and Ali in the main roles are remarkable, and it's funny and endearing to watch them discard stereotypes and discover their mutual humanity. What we liked best is the
movie teaches without preaching, it all unfolds through a myriad of natural moments between two great actors and a strong supporting cast. Top all this off with a really good soundtrack, excellent direction and production values, and an audience that laughed out loud and vigorously applauded at the end...this one is a true 10!",/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2019,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," A perfect example of Yin & Yang - and black and white has nothing to do with it.
","Outstanding true story film showing that color doesn't define us, but how we act ourselves and towards others, does.",/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2019,BassLightyear,7," A review as a respons to other (negative) reviews.
","I understand why a lot of critics don't like this film, but at the same time I feel like they're making up their minds about what they think the movie is - or should - be about. They (who disagree with the film) will say that it diminishes the horrors that the black community faced in America during the 50's - and because of that they think it's a bad film. But I thought it was a good film; in my opinion it's not a movie about Shirley and his struggles facing ruthless racism - it's about Tony Lip's psychologically reforming journey changing his mind about black people through the witnessing of Shirley's experiences. And it's that central story line the critics are disagreeing with and eschews the whole film on the premiss that it should've been about something else (Shirley journey - not Tony's).",/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2019,TheLittleSongbird,8," A re-awakening journey
","My main reason for watching 'Green Book' was due to me wanting to see as many 2018 films as possible, and that it had won the Best Picture Oscar (so naturally wanted to see too that it was that good). Like Viggo Mortensen as an actor, the film's concept was appealing and it looked appetising. Word of mouth, including from very trusted friends online and in real life, was very positive so there were plenty of other reasons too.",/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2018,Art Snob,9," Critic-proof festival hit should be big holiday winner
","Some of my movie friends were stunned when I mentioned in a thread that this was my ""People's Choice Award"" vote for TIFF 2018 (it won, btw). I generally go for weightier fare, so my being won over by a PG-13 road film with the familiar ""they-couldn't-have-been-more-different"" premise directed by the auteur co-responsible for such recent classics as ""Dumb and Dumber To"" and ""The Three Stooges"" elicited a virtual double-take.",/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2019,AlsExGal,7," Not to say it isn't a decent movie...
","... just that it's so inoffensive, safe, and cliche that I feel like I've seen it a million times before. Mortensen and Ali are terrific actors, and I am thankful for them. Without their charisma (and Viggo's willingness to shove insane amounts of food down his throat), I fear Green Book would be dead on arrival.",/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2019,classicsoncall,9," ""It takes courage to change people's hearts.""
","In an awards season that offered five Best Picture nominations based on real life stories, that might have been a record in itself. Having seen them all, I think the Academy probably got it right this year in celebrating ""Green Book"" as it's big winner. It does tend to be formulaic in it's treatment of a white racist working for a black professional musician, who by their association come to understand a little bit about each other and form a bond that survives their two month road trip. But the relationship between Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is never sugar coated. The dialog between the two men is unusually grating most of the time to be funny, though there are moments of humor that break through. It's hard to imagine how this association came to be in the first place, as the two men are so diametrically opposed in temperament, style and erudition. But underlying Tony's acceptance of a job offer came a profound sense of honor and loyalty to his employer, one that couldn't be shaken by mob acquaintances, dirty cops, or genteel elite who profess surface politeness while refusing service to a member of the black race. What particularly struck me was how the only time Dr. Shirley looked really happy was when he played at the Orange Bird saloon in the Deep South, casting aside his refined demeanor to really play his heart out for an audience that responded so enthusiastically. What the two men learn about each is directly at the heart of the story, one which transcends race, religion and background in an effort to understand what makes people similar rather than the differences that keep them apart.",/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2018,martindonovanitaly,8," Are We There Yet?
",A journey of reawakening in a Country like ours - Gore Vidal called it the United States Of Amnesia - the absurdity of the behavior in the Southern communities even the kindest ones have a jarring effect. Viggo Mortensen is sheer perfection as the all American Italian. The opening of his heart and of his mind is a total joy and Mahershala Ali provides another magnetic character to his already rich list of magnetic characters but what makes this film fly so high is the humanity that Mortensen and Ali infuse their characters with. I loved them and Green Book provided me with one of the most satisfying endings of 2018. It leaves you with the hopeful thought that perhaps we're not there yet but that we are on our way. Happy New Year!,/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2018,rphshell,10," Finally...Well-written, well-acted Movie
","This picture should be up for BEST PICTURE. It has everything: great acting, solid script-writing (something that Hollywood really needs), and lots of humor. I wish that Hollywood would make more pictures like this.",/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2018,Lotus-3,9," Greatful to have seen this
","I saw this at the premier at TIFF and was thrilled to learn the story is about a real friendship. This is not a typical road movie, or buddy film. Given the lead actors, I knew it would be something special, and it is. 
 Entertaining, funny in parts, hard to accept in others - as a white american who wasn't around in the 1960's, the racism was mind boggling and I couldn't help but feel shame. 
 Green Book has so many layers - family, culture, honesty, dignity, genius, respect, acceptance, stereotypes, racism, music, class, friendship, and fried chicken.
Whatever your views, race, or age - this film is not 'preachy', but you should appreciate an honest portrayal of a difficult time & place in history. 
I'll use the term an ""unlikely friendship"", but knowing the two men were real makes it fantastic. I'm so grateful to have learned about them and their lives.
I only wish there had been a Q&A afterward.",/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv

When the night-club Copacabana where he works as a bouncer closes for two months to be refurbished, Tony needs to find a two-month job to support his family. He accepts to become the driver of the classical Afro-American pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) in a tour with two other Caucasian musicians through the racist South of America.

20 January 2020,perica-43151,9," Very authentic
","This is a nice movie with a very authentic story behind it. Both lives of the genius composer-musician, and his once driver tough-Italian guy, who ended up acting in mafia movies and series from Godfather to Sopranos, together with his son who won 2 Oscars, are very interesting, and the story has its authenticity to stand as its greatest strength. This is how it was in the 60s. Well acted it gives a piece of that atmosphere, it is not the most stylistically innovative movie, but it is not the point. The story, which comes-off initially as anti-Italian, wins you over slowly by its charm, and the fact that it was written by Italian son of one of the protagonists, reveals that it is sincere and gently self-mocking, but with the heart in the right place, exactly like the unlikely duo - not perfect, but entirely and heartwarmingly human. In the writing since the 80s, it gives 0 fs about the PC hyst eria, and can in fact teach our dear ment ally deficient woke friends what is the true face of disc rimination and how the real life heroes of the 60s, that they would in their stup ididty surely despise, in fact look like.",/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2019,MOscarbradley,9," A good old-fashioned feel-good movie
","If ""Green Book"" does win the Oscar for Best Picture, as some people think it might, then I for one won't complain. There are, of course, better pictures, (""Roma"" and ""The Favourite"" to name two), but this extremely well-made, nicely directed, intelligently scripted, (if at times a little too obvious in its heart-tugging sentimentality), and very well acted movie ticks all the boxes. It's a feelgood film of the old-fashioned kind that can look back at the bad old days of segregation rather smugly from its 21st Century perspective without feeling particularly smug.",/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2018,Fella_shibby,10," The film, Mortensen n Ali, they all deserve an Oscar.
","This film is about the real-life friendship formed between an African American n an Italian bouncer during a road trip thru the Jim Crow South n the Sundown towns during the racial segregation period.
Mortensen was convincing as the family-devoted, street-smart bouncer with a fat belly. By the way his appetite was awesome.
Ali convincingly portrayed the loneliness n his eyes subtly channelized emotions of sadness.
The film dealt with many issues without being preachy.
Apart from the film's important message, the acting by the leads r top notch.
Mortensen n Ali shud be given Oscars for their performances.
One of the best part is the ending which takes place on a Christmas meal.",/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2018,theojhyman,9," Fantastic film, another music themed Oscar nominee
","Just caught this as the surprise film of the London Film Festival. Such a well written drama with heart, soul and comedic touches, brilliantly performed by the two main actors, and given such an authentic 1962 shiny look to the film by the production designer and cinematographer.
A truly great true story with themes that all audiences can connect with - namely, music, family, race, sexuality, friendship and love - and Viggo Mortensen probably gives the performance of a lifetime. Will surely rival A Star is Born at the Oscars in many of the same categories.",/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2019,tavm,9," Green Book was one of the best films of last year!
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. This was the true story of Tony Lip (Vallelonga) and his working relationship as the chauffer and associate of pianist Dr. Don Shirley during the early '60s as they travel throughout much of the South for the pianist's concert engagements. It's quite a touching and occasionally funny story co-written by Tony's son Nick. Nice surprise to hear it was mostly shot in Louisiana, where I live, even during a snow scene when it actually snowed in my state during December of '17! My friend and I really liked this one so that's a high recommendation!",/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2018,ColoDrz,10," Simply wonderful in its portrayal of humanity
","Green Book is a wonderful story of overcoming self-condemnation, and the resulting freedom it provides. As the film begins, Tony is locked in a prison of judgment and rejection, not from any conscious effort on his own but rather his circumstances and environment. As the self-assured and self-aware character of Dr. Shirley is introduced into Tony's life, Tony embarks on a journey of self-discovery in which he is forced to confront his own preconceived notions which ultimately stem from his skewed view of himself. As Dr. Shirley helps Tony to see himself as a man beyond his own limiting thoughts, Tony is finally able to step into his true nature as friend to Dr. Shirley.
Everywhere in this film we are reminded that people are complicated, but beyond these complications we are also reminded that everyone is the same, just looking for love and acceptance. The scene where Dolores reads Tony's letter to her cousins is spectacular in this regard. It's interesting that none of the other reviews mention the YMCA scene and aftermath, which for me was the pinnacle moment that the power shifted for these two characters confronting their own strengths and weaknesses.
This film is simply wonderful in its portrayal of humanity, and the people we need in our lives. While it comes to light that Tony's wife Dolores is completely aware of her husband's imperfections and shortcomings, she loves him just the same. But it is confrontation, not love, that is necessary to bring about Tony's redemption, demonstrating that the people who spur us to deep, personal growth are never who or what we expect.",/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2019,MarteParte,9," Respect demands respect
","A very inspiring film. I walked out of the cinema feeling like there is good even in the unlikeliest of people.
The dialogue was well written, and the main characters were equally as loveable. Viggo Mortensens acting was only overshadowed by that of Mahershala Ali, whose portrayal of an educated african-american man living in 1960's america was both heartwrenching and absolutely hilarious.
While Mortensen stood for most of the comic relief, I found myself laughing the hardest from Ali's deadpan deliveries through the character of Dr. Shirley.",/review/rw4585103/?ref_=tt_urv
