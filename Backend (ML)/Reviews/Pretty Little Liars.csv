10 July 2022,oscarjneklund,8," Exciting and addicting first time you watch it! (A)
","The one sad truth is that you can't watch it again and get as much excited and ""blown away"" reactions as you did first time you saw it. Kinda ruins it when you know who ""A"" is, No point to watch it again, besides if you just wanna have a good time and nostalgia and watch it again! But it's a good show! Bring up memories! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡²",/review/rw2807473/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2013,zacharia94,," Way too confusing and ridiculous...
","I used to watch this show, and for the first few seasons it held my interest. But come ON---I don't even care who ""A"" is anymore. Talk about milking a single plot! I finally stopped watching since the plot just kept getting more and more confusing and ridiculous, with references to characters and things that happened years ago suddenly coming back with no rhyme or reason, endless new bizarre and nonsensical twists and turns, and the always omni-present ""A"" who seems to know everyone's thoughts and actions while simultaneously thwarting attempts to uncover his/her identity. A decent show that the writers messed up in a big way! If you watch this show, you need a scorecard to keep track of the zillions of characters bouncing in and out at random.",/review/rw2807473/?ref_=tt_urv

5 October 2021,dollfacecrafter,10," late to the game
","Just started this, almost done with season 1, I love it, it is fun to watch, I love the girl's outfits, who wears that to high school ? Everyone wore jeans in my high school, no fashion sense at all. Love the Teacher/Student relationship, it is taboo, but intriguing and very realistic! And the boys are so cute, Caleb is about the cutest thing I have seen , he is a great character. Cant wait for more.",/review/rw2807473/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2013,levicavender,1," Why do so many people enjoy this show?
","Each week people are drawn in with countless trailers for next weeks' episode, which promises mystery, drama, and most of all, answers to those burning questions you might have. But when the episode finally airs, none of those things occur. You find yourself sitting through an hour of mind numbingly bad acting, extremely illogical thinking, slow moving plots, and even more unanswered questions. I began watching this show because my fiancÃ© enjoys it, so I figured I would give it a chance. But like all ABC Family shows, it lacks everything that makes a show good. None of the characters are likable, nor do they behave like a normal person would. The plot is so slow, I could probably skip 3 seasons and they still won't know who A is. If the books are to be followed, then Ali is still alive. My questions are: Why does she hate the liars so much? How is she everywhere, and how does she have everything already planned out? Why doesn't she just kill the liars? My major beef with this show is they are trying to drag it out and get as many viewers as possible. They're doing it in the wrong way though. A mystery show is supposed to give you clues, substantial ones. I don't mind that they ask questions, but they need to answer them as well. Also, the characters need to not be so stupid. I feel like I'm watching a B grade horror movie where they characters always do the opposite of what a normal human would do.",/review/rw2807473/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2017,andy_boo82,1," Average Show With Terrible Writers
",I literally made an account just to express my anger over this series and its producers.,/review/rw2807473/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2010,movie_buff37,6," Somewhat addicting
",Pretty Little Liars is one of those shows that is not fantastic but drags you in and won't let you go until you find out what's next.There is enough mystery in the identity of A to keep you watching for more clues. ,/review/rw2807473/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2019,chloegalley,10," Absolutely brilliant
",So I decided to watch pretty little liars on Netflix I was hooked from the minute it started. Bit far fetched in places but was very entertaining to watch. In my opinion the last episode was done brilliant and the acting was good especially from girl who played Spencer's. Ignore some of the negative comments and watch it and decided for yourself well worth the watch,/review/rw2807473/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2018,AnnaPagrati,10," 10/10
","Although too many people complained about the plot 'dragging' on the last seasons, I think everything clicked in a way that wouldn't be possible if the show was canceled on, let's say, the 5th season. And even though, I was a tiny little bit disappointed by the final A reveal (OK, that's partially my fault too - I had watched every theory alive ðŸ˜‚), I was 100% satisfied by the ending, concerning the couples etc..
So it's a 10/10 for me!",/review/rw2807473/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2013,talewright,1," Frivolous Fab Four Fibbers
","One of the most silly teen ""mysteries"" series ever to infest television. PLL tries to be the ""Heathers"" and ""Rivers Edge"" of the 21st Century but has more in common with ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" and ""High School Hellcats""--wait, that's an insult to those two classic ""so bad they're good"" movies.",/review/rw2807473/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2010,secretsoaps,8," Addicting!
","From the first episode I was hooked. This became my new guilty pleasure and it sometimes hurts waiting for the next episode every week. I have never read the books, and I don't want to start now in fear that I'll spoil it for myself. Here are some reasons why you should watch Pretty Little Liars. ",/review/rw2807473/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2019,dontquoteme,10," Binge watched this in 3 weeks!
","Look a lot is improbable...and you need to suspend reality. This is just plain fun. Fun trying to figure all the bad guys are fun to watch the twists. It's pure escapism. The reviews saying it's bad acting is a crock. I can't believe how many times the actors need to cry each episode and it's never a dry cry. The acting is great and so is the writing, very clever. It's best binged...i would have been frustrated waiting each week.",/review/rw2807473/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2012,roxsanahaq,3," Very frustrating and unrealistic, crap storyline & acting
","I actually continued watching out of boredom but after almost three seasons have given up!! Its the worse thing on TV and no its doesn't get better, season three I lost hope and it made me give up completely and i will not be watching anymore.",/review/rw2807473/?ref_=tt_urv

17 July 2010,Rileybob1004,10," Pretty Little Liars is the perfect combination of drama and mystery wrapped into a one hour series.
","When four girls who have recently grown apart after the event of their best friend's death find out that their deceased friend is still sending them texts, signed notably with the single-letter name of ""A"", they come together to try to stop her from following through with threats to spill their darkest secrets. Upon first thought you probably ask yourself how big these secrets could possibly be for four high school girls, but these girl's aren't just typical teenagers; their secrets run deeper than stealing a tube of lip gloss from the local drug store. Dating teachers and withholding knowledge of a father's affair, stealing sister's boyfriends, stealing sunglasses, and lesbian interests are only the beginning of the secrets that the mysterious texter can potentially spill. The biggest one involves setting a garage on fire, blinding one person and blackmailing another to make him take the wrap for it all.",/review/rw2807473/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2013,pacoulen,1," so wrong on so many levels
","Lets start with the fact that a teen ABC family show, presents a case of statutory rape as a huge love story. The show is based on books. In the books the story does not last because it is a crime, not a romance any teen should dream about.",/review/rw2807473/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2018,filippidesjensyn,9," Amazing!
","I watched this show a couple months before Season 4A came out . I knew from the first episode I was going to be hooked. It had so many twists and turns and you never knew what would happen. Charcthers you would never expect to be A and Uber A for example Mona Being A-, she did have enough ammunition against Alison but not against the other girls. And Spencer's twin who knew. Who knew spencer had a twin who would want to do this to them. ",/review/rw2807473/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2019,sidneyheintze,10," Binge watch time!!!
","This is the best series I have ever watched by far because it's kind of girly but it's also got murders and mystery in it too, which I love because it's some action and the wait of waiting to see who ""A"" is, it's just intense and it's fabulous acting and chose the 4 right girls to cast in pll ðŸ˜Š amazing!! Hooked in the first 10 minutes !!!!!",/review/rw2807473/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2011,PixyStixi,8," Interesting subplots, exciting to follow
","Pretty Little Liars is an interesting teen drama shown on ABC Family.
