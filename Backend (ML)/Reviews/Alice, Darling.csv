4 June 2022,paul_haakonsen,6," Straight forward plot, but still an enjoyable movie...
","Well, while the 2022 crime thriller ""Last Seen Alive"" is hardly rocket science or a movie that particularly revolutionized the genre, then it was actually still rather enjoyable.",/review/rw8206717/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2022,gab-67599,6," Low-Budget Butler?
","The way this movie was shot felt low-budget. Not that it was not entertaining, it was but it just felt like a b- movie. Gerard is always at his best and he was a bad-ass in this movie. Everyone else their acting felt a bit forced except for the wife she was good. Do not expect magic going into this movie but it was at least half good, so there was that I guess. Good for a one time watch, I hope Butler steps up his game and works with a REAL director next time. He is WAY too good for a movie like this!",/review/rw8206717/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2022,danieljfarthing,7," An unexceptional but taut & engaging enough thriller - that delivers what it sets out to (but no more)
","In ""Last Seen Alive"" grizzly Gerrard Butler is dropping mis-matched wife Jamie Alexander at her parents' home for a break from each other, when they stop for petrol... and she disappears. As Butler frantically searches for her the plot veers to kidnap, a seedy remote meth lab farm, cop Russell Hornsby, hillbilly baddies like Ethan Embry & Michael Irby, and a fair amount of punch-ups, shootings & explosions. Those expecting twists or complexity may be disappointed, but director Brian Goodman & writer Marc Frydman deliver a taut & engaging enough thriller that's thankfully not as dumb & bloated as so many others. For what it is, it delivers ok. Fair dinkum.",/review/rw8206717/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2022,jonsid57,5," Been done before and been done better
","Average thriller about a man whose wife disappears at a gas station and he starts looking for her . The film is a bit similar to Taken , Gone Girl , The Vanishing and Breakdown. Sadly it's not as good as any or them . Gerard Butler is okay as the husband in search of his missing wife. (who isn't a likeable character) Luckily the film isn't too long ., The film didn't get much publicity and I can see why.,",/review/rw8206717/?ref_=tt_urv

","Frantically chasing a lost wife who's disappeared, poor old Will can't make his mind up if he's Scottish or just weird, you'll soon come to realise that this is just a cunning ploy, to irritate, provoke and needle, even to annoy.",/review/rw8206717/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2022,omendata,6," Basic but effective thriller
",Ok so this is obviously a total ripoff of the superlative film The Vanishing (1993) with Kiefer Sutherland and Sandra Bullock which is one of my all time favourite thrillers so this is obviously never going to compete.,/review/rw8206717/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2022,jindann,6," Wasn't so bad
","Pretty standard kidnapping movie, which was kind of like a rough version of taken. The acting and thrill was rather decent, the plot however was a bit lacking as the story is a bit short well as the ending is a little let down. One cgi scene was terrible that looked like it was done by students. It should deserve a better rating if it had ended with better twist and intensity, 5.7 is a little underrated this movie deserves a 6.",/review/rw8206717/?ref_=tt_urv

6 June 2022,fridayblues,4," Wow, talk about low quality writing!!!
","OMG!!! The writers of this movie must have failed script writing class badly! The dialogues are terrible! Some of the stuff the actors are saying either makes no sense and/or are cringy as hell! I get that compared to the normal movies that Gerald Butler usually did, this is pretty low-budget but holy hell, the script for this is so bad! This is especially apparent with Jamie's character's parents, the dialogues that came out from the mouth of those two are so stupid and on top of that, neither one can act to save their lives!!! My god, did Gerald needed a paycheck that bad?",/review/rw8206717/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2022,TreasureHunterGirl,7," Entertaining thriller
",I love these movies that Gerard Butler makes now. I'm never gonna complain about him running around kicking butt and being the hero of the piece.,/review/rw8206717/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2022,deloudelouvain,7," Good tension building towards the end, worth a watch.
","I agree that this kind of stories have been done before, and better, but it was still good enough to entertain me without getting boring. It's a slow start movie but the tension builds up what keeps you interested. The end was actually the best part of the movie, when the suspense was at its highest. The acting wasn't bad at all but we've all seen better, and that was also the case with Gerard Butler who played the main character. I've seen better movies with him but overal it's a plot that suits him. Last Seen Alive is certainly worth a watch, just don't have too high of expectations.",/review/rw8206717/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2022,rchevalier-37303,6," Decent film for a quiet night
",Gerard Butler is quite good. His real accent slips out and it makes him more real. He's also not mr super warrior which is unusual and pleasant. Jaimie Alexander is hardly in the film and that's ok because the character is tiresome. The detective is well played but the rest of the supporting cast are really just there.,/review/rw8206717/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2022,sonerayanlar,3," Too poor copy of Kurt Russel's movie ""Breakdown""
",Too shame!! Well I like Gerard Buttler and also co star Jamie Alexander could have done a lot better than this too cheap movie with the scripts and scenerio and unfortunately very bad disapointing acting too. Don't waste your time.,/review/rw8206717/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2022,movieman6-413-929510,5," entertaining mystery thriller that remains somewhat predictable thanks to the lesser writing.
","Last Seen Alive is a new mystery thriller directed by Brian Goodman, director of Black Butterfly and What Doesn't Kill You. The film is about Will Spann (Gerard Butler), who travels with his wife Lisa (Jamie Alexander) to his in-laws. Their relationship is on the rocks and they try to work on it before they get divorced.",/review/rw8206717/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2022,Nathan4,2," Gerard Butler must have owed someone a favor
","I have no clue why Gerard Butler agreed to do this movie. He did try his best to carry it and make it watchable, but was unsuccessful. The writing, acting (by everyone else but his wife), and overall plot were soooooo bad that it was impossible to be salvaged by one performer.",/review/rw8206717/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2022,Innacana,2," Not that great
","What a stupid movie, with lots of plot holes. When your wife goes missing and police is already helping you, you don't go rambo for nothing if you are just a regular person. I find following issues with the movie:",/review/rw8206717/?ref_=tt_urv

7 June 2022,bbv-69237,4," Incoherent and ridiculous
","Over the top extreme acting by. Butler just fails - he is no good in a role that requires him to be an 'ordinary' person. The plot is silly and the direction is vague and inconsistent. There is just no build up of tension, no matter how hard Butler tries to look desperate and scared (which just does not work). Gerard you are a character actor OK - John Wayne did not cry.",/review/rw8206717/?ref_=tt_urv

12 June 2022,douros77,2," Horrible writing
","Gerard is the only reason I gave a 2. How hard and expensive would it have been for the writers to do a little research on standard LE procedure? Terrible plot and writing, subpar acting and inaccurate depiction of LE. I would've been fine never having seen this movie.",/review/rw8206717/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," Yes, we've seen this before, but it was still edge of your seat suspense and anxiety.
","This film is seasoned actor Brian Goodman's third dabble in directing, and I have to say, he nailed it. The 95 min runtime and perfect pacing just made this film fly by, all the while we were on the edge of our seats. Almost forgot to breath a few times, so that to me is great directing, and of course it helped that Butler just nailed his role so well, you could feel his anxiety. Acting doesn't get much better than that folks.",/review/rw8206717/?ref_=tt_urv
