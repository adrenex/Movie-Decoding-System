","I miss these lists, they were fun!",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2021,ThomDerd,2," The reviewers say it right: this movie is just bad, sorry Zack.
","(Netflix...once again) A stupidly bad film. So much money spent for this rather silly zombie flick and Zack Snyder got a nice paycheck for preparing and executing a script of a 10 year old. I don't even know where to start with this dumb script and scenes, let alone the enormous runtime of more than 2h, which completely killed this film.",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2021,krbodkin,1," Just Bad
","Slow, stupid and a painfully artificial narrow depth of field injected into every single shot. The characters are all abrasive. And the daughter, oh the daughter. I have never had to watch such a spoiled little brat sink a movie so fast.",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2021,FeastMode,2," even with a veteran hollywood director, netflix still produces trash
","This movie is a mashup of cliches, tropes, dumb characters and useless subplots. I could tell early on it was going to be bad, but it kept getting worse.",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2021,siderite,2," A failed comedy
","This film is directed and written by Zack Snyder?! It's garbage, from start to end. The only good bits in it are comedic and the rest is laughable, but not in a good way. It is a two hour and a half heist movie where everybody is an idiot. With zombies. They are idiots, too. The daughter, as usual, kills more people than the villains by being humane and in distress and, as unbelievable as it sounds, more of an idiot than everybody else.",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2021,t-feier,4," Messy, uninspired waste of time
","Unlike the movie, I'll keep it short: I know this is a zombie movie and didnt expect anything but a fun, gory popcorn flick. But oh boy, was I setting myself up for disappointment. The movie is so full of lazy tropes, bad dialogue and plot holes that its basically unwatchable.",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2021,cherold,4," Dumb fun without the fun
","Army of the dead begins as though it's going to be a fun B movie. 2 exchanges in different vehicles leads to disaster which leads to terror which leads to a fun title sequence in which we see a garish Las Vegas overrun by Zombies. This title sequence packs in a lot of story; in fact, in packs in about 90% of the movie's story.",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2021,Impartial-Reviewer,," If You Like A Director, It Doesn't Mean All His Work Is Good!
",A director/writer with a creativity block watches the Korean movie Peninsula and voil√†! Let's make a disfigured American bs with the same concept but with too much American bs violence and no heart. This is the case here.,/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2021,deepkumar-spider,1," Why was the Daughter character created in the first place?!
","The Girl who plays the daughter of Dave does nothing,
She probably deserved to die first,
& what's with her connection with the random lady called Geetha?!",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2021,stevebondi,4," Seemed like it could be a mix of Zombieland, The Expendables, and Oceans 11, but it does not measure up to any of those! :-(
","Some cool action and limited humor do not make up for crappy characters, crappy dialog, and a crappy story! :-(",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2021,Gordon-11,," Annoying
","The story is somewhat taking, but the daughter is just very annoying that it makes me angry.",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2021,BA_Harrison,3," Bloated like a week old corpse, and stinks almost as much.
","Of the five previous Zack Snyder films that I have seen, I have only enjoyed two, but one of those was his excellent 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead, so I assumed that the man knows what he is doing when it comes to zombies. Army of the Dead has taught me to assume nothing. This is one of the dumbest zombie films I have seen (and I've seen quite a few). It's full of stupid characters making bad decisions, horrible plot developments, and ridiculous action, and worse still, every scene is either shot with an extremely short depth of field, or some kind of blur effect, which proves irritating in the extreme. Come to think of it, some of the CGI is pretty damn ropey as well (zombie tiger!).",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2021,dcj2,5," What happens in Vegas...I didn't really care.
","***Possible mild spoilers ahead ***I had such high hopes for this one. The slow-pacing of the first act promises something more than the typical two-dimensional characters, but it never pays off. When the action finally starts, it's just a sequence of events - this happens then that happens then something else happens. None of the character choices are driven by their backstories, they just do things to move things along to the next set piece. The pacing if awful. Just when the action gets up some steam, we pause for extended, quiet dialog scenes that add nothing to the story. Arguably the two most intiguing characters - the zombie leader and his...girlfriend? Are given no backstory at all. The action pieces are shot well enough, but nothing is all that original or memorable. The dialog is cringe worthy in a typical Zack Snyder way. The musical choices try too hard to be clever (Elvis singing ""We're caught is a trap..."", the Cranberries classic song ""Zombie""...) are just too on the nose to be amusing. Overall the movie is waaaay too long. By the time we hit the 2-hour mark (with another half hour to go!) I had given up caring about any of the charavters and just wanted them to drop the nuke already so I could get on with my life. Snyder fanboys will no doubt love it, as is evident by all the 9 and 10 star reviews, but for the rest of us, this one is easily skipped.",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2021,gy-att,5," Too slow
","2.5 hours of this is way too much. Dumb conversations unfunny jokes and bad acting. Zavk Snyder, why man?",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," This one needed a ""Snyder Cut"" down to 90 mins max
","The 148 min runtime was way too long for the story Snyder wrote. There was just too much fluff and filler for the little substance the story actually had. Any attempts at humor were a failure, and Snyder missed many opportunities to add some good laughs to his writing.",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2021,the_real_smile,2," Actionless - slow motion filmed - B-actor filled - piece of garbage
","We were so excited to see this this movie, and what did we get? This movie is terrible, there is only 1 good action scene, and that is the scene at the very beginning. What follows is a movie filed with cheap B grade actors, they even hired Bigfoot for the main character, the story drags and drags and drags, sometimes 40 minutes in a row nothing worthwhile happens, certainly no action. This movie was a complete waist of our evening, we all felt terrible, what a ripoff. No, also do not watch it so see what you might have missed out, no, there is nothing exciting about this movie whatsoever.",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2021,max_111,1," I have canceled my netflix subscription after watching this.
","The worst movie of all time. I don't know why netflix make movies anymore. After 'I care alot' I lost all hope in netflix. Now coming towards this movie, i was really hyped by all the zombie genre and thought that maybe this will be another Day of the dead. But oh boy i was so wrong. This is the worst movie ever and not to mention they ruined the zombie genre so effectively. Major spoilers ahead:",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2021,jaymakak,1," Why didn't Mr. Tanaka just give them the combination to the safe?
","As hackneyed and sophomoric as this film is, the stupid never seems to end. Even in the contrived and stilted first sequence of a head on collision where the military personnel transporting the top secret shipping container, are simply too catty to stop yammering at each other like school girls for 1 minute to see the headlights of the oncoming vehicle, continuing to the scene where "" I never do leg days"" Batista is assembling Ocean's dumbest 11, because he needs the ""best"" safecracker he can find-for some reason.....",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2022,tim-stjames,7," It's mindless fun - no more, and no less.
","You can't help but appreciate Snyder for the vision he brings to his projects, even if you disagree with so many decisions that go along with them. It's a really fun escape that captures the magic of the summer blockbuster with great action set pieces and a badass ensemble, it's so hard not to recommend.",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2021,grantonslow,1," It just gets worse and worse for Zack Snyder
","This movie starts out as a 5 and then 4, 3, 2, 1 in quick succession. What else would you expect from the brilliant mind that brought us Batman vs Superman and Justice League? Plot holes galore. Writing, acting and directing was completely ridiculous. This movie is an insult to the make up artists and set workers who did a great job setting up the scenery for nothing.",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2021,thesar-2,2," A Lose-Lose Gamble
","You know how they say: there's nothing new in the zombie genre? Well, this movie 1000% proves that to be true.",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2021,darius_sutherland,1," Too long, Too boring. Just Dull.
","The review title says it all. 2.5 hours of bore. Usual mediocre movie from Netflix. It tries to add something new to the zombie genre but it really doesn't work. It's just plain and simply boring. Watch it whilst you work or play scrabble or play scrabble on your phone. Dull, dull, dull.",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2021,paul_haakonsen,4," Hyped up to be way more than it delivered...
","Of course I had to sit down and watch the 2021 zombie movie ""Army of the Dead"", as I do enjoy everything zombie. But I must admit that after having seen the trailer, then I was somewhat put off on the movie. But given the hype of the movie and Zack Snyder, and it being a zombie movie, of course I found myself sitting down to watch it.",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2021,Cineanalyst,2," Zombie Heist: A Movie Robbed of Its Brains
","Zack Snyder doesn't need an editor to enforce cuts because a movie around two-and-a-half hours is too long; he needs one because movies such as ""Army of the Dead"" are bad. The smarter zombies get, I swear, the stupider the movies are. Instead of the reanimated corpses being about something, we get zombies plus a heist flick--plus a father-daughter reunion and other who-cares dramatic arcs. Some of it's ironic, but that's about it. As if this sort of shoot-'em-in-the-head undead junk weren't formulaic enough, now we must endure the assembling of a team for the heist, the double crosses and switcheroos. And that's just before every character seems to think a deadly crisis is a good time to clear the air with their personal grievances or to pause for a gander during one of Snyder's many slow-mo or blurry playing-with-the-focus shots just long enough for a ghoul to sneak up on them. The real zombification here is us being entertained by this dreck.",/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2021,pizzadudes,3," Disappointing
",I don't bother with trailers and previews so thought it would be the same zombie world as Dawn but in a different setting and stage of the outbreak. Dawn is great and captures the mood perfectly and has a great cast. This is full of annoying cardboard cutout characters with a stupid plot with some zombies acting more like deranged humans from Mad Max or The Hills Have Eyes. Everything about this felt forced and lacked genuine emotion or tension from the getting the team together scenes to the 'heartfelt' scenes between Scott and Kate (I had to look up their names) to the mission itself (oh they're there already) and the inevitable finale. I've no idea why certain people didn't just fly in with a helicopter and get what they really wanted. I just found it all very dull and didn't care at all what happened.,/review/rw6962770/?ref_=tt_urv
