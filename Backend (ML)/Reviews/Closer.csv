",Why can't the makeup department ever get Danica's eyelashes on correctly? It's distracting and certainly not flattering. Hallmark never got them right either.,/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2022,Jackbv123,5," Fairy Tale
","If you take this movie as purely a fairy tale with some humor thrown in, then the story itself is decent. In that vein, I thought that this ""royal"" movie was a bit further from any reality and closer to fantasy than most. Even the relationship between Emily and Prince Henry seemed unreal to me and that's where a movie like this should be a little more believable.",/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv

",Danica McKeller and Neil Bledsoe were great together. The movie was funny and entertainment. The scenery was beautiful.,/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,teepack-75312,7," Not bad but not particularly memorable
","Wanted to see what the fuss was about with Danica's first GAC movie. It was okay. The script was a little bland, but there were a few funny moments. I like Neal Bledsoe as a royal. Overall this movie is worth a watch, but probably not worth watching twice.",/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2022,rebekahrox,6," Surprisingly Watchable
","Plot-wise, this was a common example of the royal/commoner romance plot. Danica McKellar is a new author with one successful novel who is being pressured to submit her second romance novel per her contract. Predictably she has writers block and is given the opportunity to be a caretaker at a remote lodge in the mountains for some peace and quiet. No, it's not haunted and she doesn't turn into a homicidal maniac. Sorry to disappoint. The owners are European and haven't been there for years. All she has to do is knock the icicles off the eaves, take care of the furnace, and find her inspiration to honor her contract. The owner shows up unexpectedly and it's a prince with his two minions.",/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2022,Avidviewer-02847,3," Beautiful location, lousy script.
","Most TV movies involving royalty are always fake, with fake countries, fake accents, fake protocol and poor acting and this one is no exception. The writers never do any research to make the plot and dialog sound authentic, these writers are a prime example.",/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,taylornan0909,6," Tired of King/Prince meets ordinary girl ....
","I watched this movie because I like Danica, I don't recall having seen Neal Bledsoe before. Their chemistry was good and the scenery was nice. It just seems like every week there is a new Royal movie. I have not seen one that was really believable. This is not one that I would watch again, it was slow and boring.",/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,ronbokirk,2," disappointing
",Danica and Neal both turned in good performances. They also had a little chemistry in the last half. The scenery was good but none of this was enough to rescue this movie from a bad supporting cast and extremely bad writing.,/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,rsondra,10," GREAT LOVE STORY
","I wouldn't expect anything less from one of Danica movies...Great Chemistry with both of these actors..funny, witting, charming..what more could you want in a winter movie..cuddle up on the couch and watch this movie..you want regret it.",/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,VetteRanger,8," We enjoyed it :-)
","We tend to like Danica McKellar in her roles, and this was no exception. Funny thing. We watched it last night and I'd completely forgotten we watched it when first out, probably about a year ago. I kept thinking things looked familiar until we finally got to some scenes I absolutely recognized. I do a lot of computer work while we watch these movies and sometimes I only catch snatches of them, so last night I paid attention.",/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,tinatalksavon,10," Fun movie
","Cute movie, entertaining & funny, good ending. Danica had her 'fake moments & expressions', but she did much better in this movie.",/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2022,jeffrapage,," Best ever
",This was the best first movie of GAC family of the new year and I absolutely loved it it was heartwarming definitely was not boring it had a funny parts Henry was very caring he had a wonderful speech at the end and he gave his kingdom to his sister you don't see that that happening at the end of movies I absolutely love ending.,/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,Sergiodave,6," Watchable slush
","A typical fairy tale TV movie that does exactly what watchers of these movies want. I didn't know of Neal Bledsoe, but his accent was pretty good. There are a lot of principalities, duchy's and Crown states in Europe, perhaps trying something not sounding so British would be a novel idea.",/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2022,moho-40260,8," Good for a Winter Sunday
","I found this on Prime as I do not have GAC, and I must admit I do like Danica, although she portrays the same type of characters in all her HM and now GAC movies. That said, it was enjoyable, beautiful scenery and good supporting cast. Neal Bledsoe was convincing as a ""British?"" prince, and he and Danica did have chemistry, but I was disappointed in the dialogue between them with her trying to persuade him not to pursue the life of a royal, which he eventually did. She should have been more supportive and explained to him how he could have it both ways, but in my humble opinion, his abdicating was very unmasculine. But overall, I did enjoy it. No wokeness either.",/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2022,daeanarah,4," prince not king
","It was okay, should have explored the relationship more seemed hurried. Didn't like the ending. And the king just gave in after pushing the people who were with the prince to force him accept what should have been inevitable.",/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2022,d-robold,3," Ho-hum
","If this is what to expect, I'm very disappointed. Tired, trite, boring, predictable, phony, and just plain dumb. I kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't. Juvenile at best. Not worth watching again.",/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,juliefolden,3," Boring movie
","This wasn't a favorite Hallmark movie for me. In fact it missed the mark completely. I didn't feel the chemistry between the two main characters. And the story has been done so many times and done much better than this one. Plus, the message was selfish. Do what's right for you and the rest be damned. Sometimes we must sacrifice in life, but that doesn't mean we lose out on happiness or the ability to be ourselves. Selfish sentiment for a selfish age. I have loved both actors in other movies but this one just didn't do it for me. I wouldn't recommend this movie. You can find the same story only better elsewhere.",/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,halvor-moen,2," Frosty ruin
","The story is far from being a delightful winter palace. The script is thinner than rice paper and those odd accents are better left forgotten. It's a cheap and simple production, you'll notice it soon enough if you decide to watch the film.",/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv

1 May 2022,alar62,1," Just couldn't finish it...
","Danica McKellar is the only reason I gave this movie a chance and sad to say, she just couldn't save this. The money/deal must have been too hard to turn down.",/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2022,smithduke,4," Not Danica's best! Not even close!
","Horrible movie! Danica jumped the shark. She plays the same person, time and time over. Now she's become a bumbling idiot. If she's tried to change her usual character it's not working. Very disappointed.",/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2022,stdperth,5," Wanted to like it, but....
",Danica and Bledsoe had more chemistry in an earlier movie....and a better script. Bledsoe is watchable in this one but Danica is hard to watch. Her scenes feel rushed or incomplete.,/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2022,stormy602,2," Run Back To Hallmark Danica
","This was the first movie I've watched on the GAC Family channel and I was hoping Danica McKeller would make it a new go to channel. But, then it started and that hope faded fast. They must have written The Winter Palace as Danica was signing her contract and started filming 20 minutes later because there was no chemistry at all between the two stars and the only likable person other then Danica was the prince's bodyguard. I'm okay with the aging Hallmark stars moving to GAC, they need an infusion of youth, but Danica can't be happy with her first movie. I'll give GAC another shot, but they'd better put more effort into their movies or I'm gone.",/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2022,mbalboa-91024,1," Need a better lead actor.
","We were excited and looking forward to watching this movie. Definitely disappointed. I like Danica. She's always been a great actress. She really draws you into the story but can't carry the movie alone. The lead actor Neal leaves much to be desired. This could've been a great Christmas movie. During the fall we always plan on watching several Christmas movies, new and old. This was one on our list. We watched until the end anxiously awaiting for it to get better. If it weren't for Danica we probably just would've stopped watching all together. We still have lots more movies we'll be watching!",/review/rw8720192/?ref_=tt_urv
