22 October 2021,MogwaiMovieReviews,4," Smart and Detailed but Joyless and Hollow
","This new sci-fi cartoon's premise has a lot of promise, with endless clever ideas and attention to detail, but it feels coldly generic and too much designed by committee: the basic idea is Men In Black all over again, and the alcoholic dad is an obvious attempt to appropriate some of that Rick Sanchez vibe. None of the characters are even slightly likeable or relatable and the tone is too relentlessly busy, with no building of necessary tension or intrigue from one scene to the next. The script is one-liner after one-liner after one-liner and yet I didn't laugh once.",/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2021,deothor,8," It's damn good!
",Have in mind this review is from only few episodes so far,/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,djurrepower,6," OK
","It was OK. Certainly better than most adult cartoons you see on netflix nowadays. The story has some good moments, and the series does have its fair share of originality. But overall not much that really stood out either. So the series is sometimes a bit funny, and sometimes has some good moments. But in between those moments the show felt a little underwhelming.",/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,doomedmac,8," Give it a chance!
","I watched Inside Job because it was endorsed and produced by Alex Hirsch, the creator of Gravity Falls. GF is one of my favorite shows of all time, and this show definitely carried over some of that show's energy.",/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,amooorales,9," Very funny and clever
",Funny and charming show! If you enjoy Rick and morty you'll like this show. I'm not a big believer of conspiracy theory's but I always found them entertaining! Glad someone thought to make it into show.,/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2021,rdoubleoc,10," I like.
","I like this, but they need to keep the quality and world consistent. This is definitely one of Netflix's better animated shows, though. I really hope they make another season.",/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2021,stefanozucchelli,8," Very good series
","Beautiful series that from the first episode kidnaps you, not too metaphorically, and drags you into a world of conspiracies and crazy theories. This series takes a lot from the success of ""Rick and Morty"" and ""Gravity falls"". However, we have to wait to see if he will be able to maintain this level in future seasons as well.",/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2021,oliverriordan,8," A pretty enjoyable show
","At first glance ""Inside Job"" can be passed as another ""Rick and Morty"" wannabe, but it was surprisingly funny. The animation is good with tons of hidden details throughout and while some characters are very one dimensional others are very interesting and fun to watch. It's a little rough around the edges, but ""Inside Job"" is an overall enjoyable show.",/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,Dust_in_it_off,8," Check it out
","Worth a watch, just hope they don't cancel this like they did Hoops. Netflix is a little light on the adult animation, and this is a step in the right direction.",/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2021,jasha89,6," Not great, not terrible
","I like the idea, playing around with conspiracy theories which are now more relevant than ever (in terms of how many people believe them). And here and there some jokes really land but overall I feel that nobody put too much effort into making this series because some of the jokes are very lazy (yelling ""wake up sheeple"" to literal half human half sheep mutant...come on!).",/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,drael64,6," Occasional wit unfortunately marred
","There's some good jokes in here. But the show can't help itself but also insert the preachy snark of it's writers politics. Which genuinely is a missed mark, considering all side of the isle could enjoy the premise.",/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2021,technusgirl,4," Boring, not funny, lacks originality
","After a few episodes of not laughing at anything, I stopped watching. The main female character both looks like and resembles Rick from Rick and Morty. Her father has a drinking problem, which reminds me again of Rick and Morty. Her male coworker looks and reminds me of Fry from Futurama. I'm guessing they did that to attract audiences who enjoy those shows, but it's too obvious. The show lacks originality, it's not funny and just overall bland.",/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2022,hydralien-40230,3," Not again...
","What on earth happened to the show?! First season was unpredictable and witty and sporadic and acidic and mean, and second is all flat garbage humor and bland dialogues? Such a letdown...",/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2021,Okonh0wp,6," Mildly watchable. Not sure how high the upper ceilling is.
","An animated cartoon about a federal government department that does damage control in a world where most conspiracy theories are true. Although it has some of the cynicism of ""Rick and Morty"", it's co-created and executive produced by Alex Hirsch (along with Shion Takeuchi) who's most famous for the imaginative yet child-appropriate ""Gravity Galls."" It's a dark turn for sure from the creator and the complexity of the subject matter is heightened by giving the central protagonist (Lizzie Caplan) the Aesperger's label.",/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,On_The_Mark,3," Painfully unfunny
","I got through one episode and it was all I could take. I gave it every chance. It's another one of those shows written by people who do not know how to write funny. There is a setup-punchline here and there but it's not a funny punchline. I never laughed once, not even close. A couple times I recognized why they thought it was funny but it wasn't funny. Most of the time it's just groanworthy. I'm not sure if it's also because the whole concept is dumb, maybe it gets better but there's no way I'm sitting through another episode of this awful show again.",/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2021,tommypezmaster,10," Another Netflix Hit
","Love how this show has a lot of lore as well as the references. This show has a lot of potential to have a long run, so please let it last long.",/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2021,wcooke-07380,10," Holy stuff this show is great
",Great characters I love every main and side character especially Mike and the robes it has a good cliff hanger and every episode has a great plot aswell.,/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv

",Every conspiracy wrapped up in this animated comedy .,/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,quantumphyzx,10," Best animated political satire in forever
","This is an excellent satire on the contemporary state of the red versus blue division in America post-Trump. It hits both sides with equal punching weight and no one is spared. It's like Rick and Morty meets The Colbert Report with a heavier dash of anti-liberalism, creating a balanced spoofing of current politics that is sorely lacking. It's kind of like Last Week Tonight meets The Drudge Report (if Drudge Report were a show instead of a news aggregation spider).",/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,playstationonward,10," Brilliant show
",I first was going to write this off as a bad Rick and Morty clone from posters and trailers I had seen. I'm glad I didn't. First 3 episodes were watched for my review and all of them were awesome.,/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2021,pfne,7," Some quality but let down by overall poorness
","The story line is.. interesting.. it pokes fun at a lot of conspiracy theories and the people that believe them. It makes for a few fun moments peppered through out the show, but there's also a lot of generic and clichéd moments.",/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,imdb-40147-36693,9," Well done
","Got to episode 3 by now, and so far I'm loving it!",/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,Reenoeh,8," Giving very much Rick and Morty but also a little more
",It's good. I feel like it can go a lot further and they played it safe for season 1 but it was fun to watch. Some plot lines were a little drawn out or not paced well that it felt a little too stagnant in the middle but overall. Nice job!,/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2021,rune-andresen,2," A Low Quality «Copy & Paste» of Rick and Morty
","This is an awful attempt to copy the success of Rick and Morty. Not funny, loud, no humor, unoriginal ideas.",/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv

",Interesting and fun - definitely a watch for those who enjoyed deep space but with a lighter - much lighter - tone.,/review/rw7473861/?ref_=tt_urv
