27 July 2022,dpoland-76589,9," Sad that we don't get more
","It seems the streaming giants are all competing for the big ticket shows like Stranger Things, Lord of the rings stuff and game of thrones stuff. I like those types of shoes too but I also appreciate something deeper, slower and meaningful.",/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2022,TxMike,," It is like an elevator, but it doesn't move, we do.
","It is a bit distressing to see a few very negative reviews among some who haven't even watched a full episode. Foremost, it is highly unlikely that experienced actors like Sissy Spacek and JK Simmons would sign on to do a bad series. Unlike a 90-minute movie, where everything needs to be accelerated, in this series relationships and the story lines are developed slowly. Viewers wanting instant gratification probably should stay away.",/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2022,bosporan,8," Gorgeous character driven sci-fi
","JK Simmons, Sissy Spacek and space, what is not to like? Well nothing actually, this is not a clich√©d, frantic lasers and technology sci-fi show, but rather a character driven story centred on family, relationships plus growth and decline over time.",/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2022,cav6,10," Tragedy
","Everyone had different taste. That being said, at 64 this series was one of the best I have seen! It is a shame that quality programs get cancelled while junk shows like the Bachelor and such roll on for years.",/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2022,paulcreeden,10," Didn't rush through this one.
","Engaging story line, cast, setting and art direction. So enjoyable. I paced my way through it rather than binging it. It is entering another world on many levels. The interplay between Spacek and Simmons is wonderful. The slow build of suspense leads to a powerful climax. Hope Season 2 is being planned. I'm in.",/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2022,nenms11,9," Crying over cancellation
",Amazon had a hit here but it needed better advertising. The cast was superior to many other shows. Also the story line needed more time to develop.,/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2022,Sunsphxsuns,9," Come On Ya'll It's Way Too Early To Tell
","Night Sky isn't an easy genre, and after viewing the first episode, my guess is that it will likely infuriate some viewers, bore a few others, confuse many, but also delight people like me that thrive on ""Interstellar themes."" After only one episode I decided to roll the dice and gamble where this series is headed. I think the direction might be somewhere between ""Cocoon"" (1985) and ""Contact"" (1997). And while those aforementioned films were beautifully done, they didn't have two veteran Oscar winning actors: Sissy Spacek and J. K. Simmons. And this alone may be what affords this new series a significant opportunity to succeed.",/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2022,joiningjt,10," For you people that didnt watch the... Whole season YOUR LOSS!! WOW was that PHENOMENAL!!! season 2 BEST GET HERE FAST!!
",1st off can you get 2 better leads than J. K. Simmons and Sissy Spacek NO!! Their skills shine in this series I've grown to love them both JK. Finally got his oscar so I guess I cant say hes Underrated anymore but damn he just eats up every script and STEALS every scene hes in and Sissy is EXACTLY the same so those 2 leading a series is a match made in Series Heaven!! Love everything about this show it PISSES me off when I see JERKS giving it a 1 after 2 episodes I wish those could be eliminated I mean THATS like reading 2 chapters of a book and then giving it a review..... IMPOSSIBLE and sorry people but sometimes it has to move a little slow because it's a fricking STORY they're telling lord of the rings was a 9 hour series and it was a fricking movie folks and NO ONE COMPLAINED and it was 2 SHORT!! We loved it so much we binged it in a day in a half!! Its a SOLID 10 all the way can hardly wait for season 2 you can just feel that this series will get better with each one just hope the series gods end it correctly that's ALWAYS the tricky part!! Again BRAVO to the WHOLE cast and crew absolutely brilliant series!! Ignore the haters they probably think buffy the vampire slayer is a phenomenal series!!,/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2022,akira-hideyo,9," Worthy slow burn
","It takes a while and a whole bucket of patience to savor this series. For those who made it to the season end, none can deny a season 2 is needed to start the real meat to this substantial character driven series. The last episode ramped up the pace and plot direction of what lies beyond the built up foundation and exciting frontier ahead. Sissy Spacek still got the magic of what makes her one of the screen greats. Can't wait for next season to find out why ET can't phone home.",/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,mdt64,9," Prime made a mistake canceling this series
","This is an exceptional sci-fi series and these days those are rare. Character-driven, mysterious, and suspenseful. Excellent acting. Good effects. The writing really conveys what it feels like to be in the characters' shoes.",/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2022,kalibeans,9," An excellent narrative driven science fiction series!
",Night Sky has the feel of a Ray Bradbury/Rod Serling/Robert Heinlein tale. Which is high praise indeed!! From the reviews I've read it seems that the most frequent complaint.is that the storyline moves too slowly. That is what makes it so refreshing and unique.,/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2022,lornak-18008,10," Fascinating
","I just sat and watched it all night in one sitting. So yes, I was fascinated. Did it occasionally get a little slow? Maybe a little, but even then the story was interesting. The acting was amazing-how could it not be with Sissy Spacek and J. K. Simmons leading the cast? All of the side characters were pretty great as well. There was plenty of action without it being an ""action"" movie. People do get hurt and some die. Mainly though it was the characters that were important, their actions and interactions with others that drove the story. Yes, it was science fiction, and to me really good science fiction, but I also enjoyed the elderly couple and their back story concerning their son, their granddaughter and their love for each other. And although we don't get all the answers, we do get quite a bit. The fun part? They left it wide open for another season! By the way, I didn't tell anything about the actual story on purpose. I loved going in with very little idea what to expect and I'm glad I did.",/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2022,efd-10467,7," Better than Most
","Anything with J K Simmons in it is worth a look, the show is not your normal action packed sci fi series, it goes deeply into characters and has long periods of dialogue.",/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2022,leptilic,10," Slow sci-fi and its actually great
","This low rates are unbelievable. They are used to - pew pew death destruction - and they think that's a sci fi. They are new age kids who never watched Space Odyssey, Man on Earth, Lost, or any Steven King adaptation or capable for intellectual shows and movies... I would rate this 9, just because we got so little in season 1, but they made me rate it 10. Show is great, acting is 10, effects are not too often, just in right area - 10. Shows actually goodness in people, a mystery, story, vibes I felt from Dome and Lost. I guess that kind a shift on people who like action and violence all the time bang bang. QQ for them.",/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2022,info-90701,10," Thought provoking, not for people who like mindless action
","This was excellent on so many levels. It is true story telling depicted by exceptional Actors, Creator, Musicians, Cinematographer(s) and Writers. This is in the vain of the original Twilight Zone, in a series, and not for people who don't like to think, and just want to follow one absurd shooting, killing, etc. After another. If you liked The Last Kingdom, and the nightmare that Uetrid was, don't bother. This is not for you.",/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2022,zhivago97,10," Awesome
","One of the best limited series in a long time. Slowish, but satisfying mix of family melodrama and creative sci fi. I hope there is a second season because the first has so many cliffhangers.",/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2022,surfingnaked1,7," Nice show
",The acting is very good. Production value is also very good. It moves a bit slow but is still interesting. Worth the binge. Sissy spacek is a 10 actress.,/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2022,Mccadoo,6," Just saw that it's been cancelled...
","I only got halfway through episode four of Night Sky. Spacek and Simmons do their usual masterful jobs filling out their characters and I found the premise intriguing, it just moved much too slowly for me. And I don't mean a lack of explosions or aliens or such, the plot just moved at such a glacial pace that I found myself losing interest.",/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2022,heratyplant,," For drama lovers, who might like a bit of scifi.
","Can't rate it yet as I haven't seen it all, but I do like it, even though it is purposefully slow.",/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2022,deacon_blues-88632,8," Simmons & Sissy are fabulous!
","Great series about an elderly couple with a secret. Kiah McKirnan is gorgeous and is wonderful to watch. Don't want to give too much away, so I'll just give it my highest recommendation. Just watch it; it starts slow, give it a few episodes to get rolling. BTW: I have a bad feeling that the bad guys will turn out to be some orthodox Christian sect. Hope I'm wrong!",/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2022,orchidami,10," Excellent Story
","I love this story and who doesn't love Sissy Spacek and JK Simmons (personally Mr Simmons is like one in a century great actor) Hope it gets another season. Really good acting. Original story, great talent and chemistry.",/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2022,braininacat,8," A different kind of mystery sci-fi
","At its core this show is more of a mystery show then a sci-fi show. Following in theme of shows like ""severance"" and ""outer range"" this show is at its core a modern mystery with some sci-fi fantasy entanglements. If you liked either of those other 2 shows I just listed thorn this is right up your ally. I'm very glad this is becoming the new standard for shows like this because they are all very good. The adt Jog in this show is amazing and the story telling is done very well. The mystery builds slowly leaving you wanting to know more and more till it ends. The downfall of this show is that when it does end, there is so much unanswered and I've read reports there will be no second season so there will be no answers to those questions sadly. They had so much more to show us and tell with this story. Would have been a 9 or 10 star if we got a little more but sometimes less can be more in a way. Anyways fantastic show and check it out if you have Amazon prime.",/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2022,grlym-46849,5," Masterful acting, but way too slow to be watched
",I premise is so interesting. The acting is grade A,/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2022,mldardar,9," Refreshing series, after struggling through From
","Besides proving (as if any classic movie fan needs it) that you can have good dialogue without the f-word in every sentence, Night Sky also didn't have characters so obnoxous that I was hoping every episode to see them shredded. JK Simmons' character is certainly bull-headed & jealous of anyone getting his wife's attention, but you know it's because of his deep love. But it isn't short on annoying characters and antagonists. Sissy Spacek is so lovable as the retired teacher, everyone would wish they had in school. The characters and the story kept me interested throughout, and I hope I'll get to be with Franklin and Irene for another season, and the other great characters I've come to care about.",/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2022,fontane007,8," Slow burner but worth the watch
",Just finished watching the final episode of series 1 to find that Amazon have dropped this little gem of a program. Really disappointed as the characters were great and with an original storyline this was one of the best TV series I've seen for some time.,/review/rw8498159/?ref_=tt_urv
