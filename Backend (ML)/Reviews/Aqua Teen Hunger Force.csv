14 March 2008,Smells_Like_Cheese,9," Very cute and so much fun! Dr. Suess would be proud
","I saw the first teaser trailer for Horton Hears a Who a few months ago, and I have to say that it was a little off putting, it looked kind of strange and like it might be another Cat in the Hat lousy movie, but then they started advertising it a little more and it looked more cute. So I decided to check the film out today and I am really impressed, so far I'd say this is the best animated film of 2008 that I've seen. I remember reading the book as a child, it's one of my old time favorite's, you could never go wrong with Dr. Suess. When it comes to his films being put up on the silver screen, excluding the 40 minute cartoon classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas, other films like The Grinch and The Cat in the Hat have been ultimate flops and horrible. But Horton Hears a Who proves otherwise and is a wonderful film to watch.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2008,claudio_carvalho,7," A Person Is a Person No Matter How Small
","In the jungle of Nool, the elephant Horton hears a voice in a speck; he uses a clover to rescue the speck of dust and he makes contact with the Mayor of Whoville. Horton discovers that in that tiny speck there is a city crowded of people and he decides to leave Whoville in a safe place. However, the evil Kangaroo does not believe in his words and finds Horton dangerous for the children of Nool, making them believe in what they can not see, hear or feel, and incites the animals against Horton.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2008,Jay_Exiomo,8," Fast-paced and touching step up for Blue Sky
","I guess it wouldn't be remiss if I've approached ""Horton Hears a Who!"" with some reservations as the trailers were anything but something to be excited about. Had it not been for the Whos and the Dr. Seuss tag that comes with the title, this latest computer-animated film from the ""Ice Age"" team would come off as yet another animal-on-a-mission flick straight from the assembly line. And films adapted from one of Dr. Seuss' books haven't been as successful as when they were in print, to put it lightly.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2008,cryofry,9," I do like, Sam I am
","So far, this is the best possible example of bringing a Dr. Seuss book to life. The animation is top notch and the design of the characters stay true to Dr. Seuss' vision. Overall, a splendid effort from 20th Century Fox.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2008,johnnymacbest,10," Finally, a film that does justice to one of Dr. Suess's childhood favorites!!
","For the first time in years, I can state wholeheartedly that this film is the most faithful adaptation of Dr. Suess's children's books EVER being brought to the big screen with the voice talents of Jim Carrey, Steve Carell, and of course, Carol Burnett. I've never thought that Suess's cartoon illustrations can be so wonderfully spot on in this film with its bright, crisp colors, and flawless animation. What's great about all this is that they expand upon the film, rather than improving it with excess baggage like they did in 2004's live-action flop ""The Cat in The Hat"" which pretty much was ""The Batman & Robin"" adaptation of the classic children's book and I hated that film with an utmost loathsome passion. At least ""The Grinch Who Stole Christmas"" was entertaining in its own right, though I admit it too was a little nauseating; namely because some scenes had so many garishly lit colors and was a bit too over the top. With all that aside, ""Horton Hears a Who"" not only will be the best animated film of the year, but may also win an Oscar for ""Most Faithful Adaptation of a Children's Classic"". I think this film will appeal to children and adults and for those who read the book since childhood not to mention serve as another venue of wholesome family entertainment for the general audience.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2008,fwgrhouse,10," Hilarious!!!!
","I went and saw this movie with my high school drama group, we had recently done Suessical for a school musical and I played the Mayor of Whoville, and I enjoyed the whole thing from start to finish. The cast of this film did an outstanding job with the voices of the characters, Jim Carrey is most notable in my opinion. Steve Carell also did an amazing job as the Mayor of Whoville.It also has good, clean humor that is both funny and suitable for all ages. I laughed through nearly 90% of the film and I didn't see one thing that would be deemed inappropriate for someone young. This movie lives up to the legacy of the book and I don't care what age you are, you will laugh out loud and enjoy this hilarious Dr. Seuss movie.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2008,moutonbear25,8," Who-larious!
","Dr. Seuss has not always found fortune when making his way from page to screen. But, this latest incarnation is the most who-larious I've ever seen. Get it? Who-larious? Like ""hi-larious"" but with ""who"". As in all the Who's down in Whoville and little Cindy Lou Who? Fine, roll your eyes but you'd be rhyming too if you stopped being so cynical and saw HORTON HEARS A WHO! It's funny; it's goofy; it's surprising and loopy. It's colorful and flashy; it's unexpected and splashy. Wait. Splashy? Is that even a word? I needed something to rhyme with flashy and what I came up with was absurd. Sorry, I promise I won't rhyme all the way through. Besides I'm no match for Dr. You-Know-Who. It's just that this movie is so darn adorable when all the previous Seuss movies have been basically horrible. The spirit of the book remains completely intact but it's modern somehow and as a matter of fact, the ideas have expanded without looking back. Now, thanks to the good folks at Blue Sky, the studio that gave us ICE AGE before this, Dr. Seuss can rest easy, his legacy revered and no longer amiss. So pack up your car, pack up your girl and your boy and bring them to see Horton, a movie the whole family canÂ… hmm, what rhymes with ""boy""? Employ? Coy? Toy? Nevermind. Bring them to see Horton, a movie the whole family can appreciate. ",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2009,ccthemovieman-1,8," High-Def Really Makes This Come Alive
","There is a stunning difference in watching this animated feature on regular DVD and viewing it on Blu-Ray. The latter dramatically elevates my rating of this movie, because the story is just so-so.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2008,dfranzen70,8," Who Awakening
","Oh, thank goodness, the third time IS the charm. Finally, finally, and finally, Hollywood gives us a movie that actually and perfectly embodies the spirit of Theodor Geisel, aka Dr. Seuss. Criminey crickets! Horton Hears a Who! is wholly imaginative fun that feels like it's channeling the good doctor's playful exuberance and ingenious creativity with every syllable and splotch of animation.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2008,shrinkingman06,9," Knock knock, whos are there
","It's interesting to see a pretty big creature like Horton concerned with protecting the tiniest creatures of all...even if the others in the jungle of Nool may not believe that's he's right about all those tiny people on the speck (well, maybe Rudy, the Sour Kangaroo's son, may think he could be right...)",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2008,planktonrules,8," Excellent family entertainment--and thank goodness it doesn't stray too far from the source material.
","Okay, many of you are about to become offended, but I've gotta say it. The movie version of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" (THE GRINCH) was a horrible movie in practically every way. The worst problem with it is that the entire moral lesson of the original story is lost and in fact the movie states the exact opposite of what the author intended!! In the book and Chuck Jones special, the Whos were nice folks that didn't need all the presents as they were sincere in their reverence for the holidays. In the Jim Carey remake, the Whos were all selfish and materialistic!! What a horrible way to ruin Dr. Seuss' vision! It's like translating the Bible and making Satan the good guy!",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2008,joecantongamingguru,7," Very Well Done Film
","I'm telling the truth...i thought this movie would be a stinker from the teaser trailer and TV spots but this surprised me as well as every other person at the screening. It even surprised the film operator! Anyway, the great voice cast voiced by some great actors, Jim Carrey and Steve Carrell and even Seth Rogen(which is a nice change for him, from all his dirty cursing roles(don't get me wrong,i love him in those roles)). Dane Cook was a little annoying, but it wont really distract you from the big picture. In this film, Steve Carrell is the Mayor of Who-Ville, a town on a dandelion full of tiny people. Jim Carrey plays Horton...who is a elephant who finds a dandelion, picks it and figures out he must protect it because of Who-ville. Seth Rogen plays a rat like creature in his role. A supporting cast with Amy Poehler, Jonah Hill, Dan Fogler and much more. This film is great for little kids and a surprising delight for adults.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2014,SnoopyStyle,7," Sweet kids movie with a good message
","Horton the elephant (Jim Carrey) from the jungle of Nool hears a voice coming from a speck of dust. It turns out to be the voice of the Mayor (Steve Carell) of the microscopic town of Whoville where the Whos live. He tries to save the speck by placing it on top of Mount Nool. But nobody believes him, and the strict Kangaroo endeavors to stop him. No matter what the obstacle, Horton must save the Whos. After all, a person is a person, no matter how small.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2008,DICK STEEL,7," A Nutshell Review: Horton Hears a Who!
","I've got to make a mental note that movies that have trailers playing in the cinemas for the longest time, do not a boring movie make, even if the first half of the movie plays like the extended version of the trailer, telling us things we already know, spelling out the premise all over again.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2008,voicesmp,8," True Telling instead of an Adaptation
","Third time seems to be a charm for the big screen adaptations of Dr. Seuss. Finally, the film world has gotten it write in the presentation of Horton Hears A Who. There is no added surprises to this film, unlike its predecessors The Grinch and The Cat in the Hat. The storyline follows the book almost exactly, with the extra time coming from adding detail instead of adding new events.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2019,pokemon_trainer_lucas,10," My favourite animated film of all time
","Horton Hears a Who is a beautifully animated movie, filled with laughter, emotion, and imagination. As a child, it would captivate me time and time again, no matter how many times I watched it. Now, as an adult, it still brings a smile to my face, proving that it is the ideal film to watch as a family because it is enjoyable for both the adults and the kids.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv

",You will probably not like this for the simple reason that as a movie it could never stand as far above other movies as it does as a book above other books.,/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2020,havoke-74121,5," It has good animation, and some thoughtful ideas.
","Adapting this from a children's book with few pages, it's just stretched out by this 86 minute run time. As much as I like ""Jim carrey"" playing Horton the Elephant, the direction it takes him and the characters, feels far too manic for its own good. It just feels too crazy. This is an animated film that would have benefitted from just slowing down, or maybe just going to timeout for a minute.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2011,TheLittleSongbird,8," Terrifc Dr Seuss adaptation
","I have always been a fan of Dr Seuss's funny and charming stories, but the adaptations of his work have had mixed results. There are timeless classics such as 1966's How the Grinch Stole Christmas, but there are also abominations such as 2003's The Cat in the Hat.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2008,disdressed12,9," a very well done Dr. Seuss adaptation
","after living through the travesty that was the live action adaptation of The Cat in the Hat,i wasn't sure what to expect.this movie is not live action,which is a plus.i was pleasantly surprised by it.it's actually clean wholesome fun the whole family can enjoy.there's a little action and adventure,and a lot of comedy.the movie is also touching.it also has a message,that basically says,we're all significant and we all deserve to be treated equal.it's not heavy handed at all.in fact,i thought it was quite subtle.i also liked the voice cast.Jim Carrey was very good as Horton,Steve Carell was also good as his mouse friend,and Carol Burnett as the Kangaroo who rules the forest was also good.parents,this is a movie you can take your kids to(and enjoy yourself)without worrying if there is anything that is not appropriate.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2008,dbborroughs,6," Some of the best animated madness is mixed with some of the blandest
","Beautifully animated retelling of the Dr Suess tale of Horton the elephant finding the speck of dust where Whoville resides and then having to protect it from danger. As good as the film looks its an uneven affair. Brilliant set pieces (anime homage) and jokes (monkeys stuffing bananas in their mouths) are followed by exposition and bits that confuse humor with busy action. Despite or because of some of the best cartoon jokes in years the film still disappointed me- how could a film that is capable of such cleverness so often miss the mark? Okay it doesn't miss the mark so much as be be dull (or not live up to the mark the good stuff sets for itself). Half way in I was annoyed enough to want to leave. The one thing that doesn't disappoint is the voice cast with Jim Carrey fine and not too silly as Horton, Steve Carrell as the Mayor quite good, Carol Burnett evil as the Kangaroo and Charles Osgood wonderful as the narrator.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2020,PennyReviews,7," Good Enough
",The animation was good and the story pretty entertaining. There were some nice family dynamics and the drama was enough to make the movie interesting.,/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2014,cherold,5," Not that funny
","This is probably a good movie for kids. It's very well animated and pretty frenetic. It also does a decent job of adapting the story. It expands Horton's story a bit, and it expands the Whoville story a lot, but it feels like it wants to stay close to the source material, unlike The Lorax.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2021,adamjohns-42575,6," ""WE ARE HERE!""
","I have been quite surprised with the Dr Seuss films lately. After the disappointment of the first 'Grinch' and 'The Cat In The Hat', this one, 'The Lorax' and the 2018 'Grinch' have all been really well done and very funny and clever too.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2009,poe426,4," The book was better...
","Never, ever fails to amaze me when someone whose writing credentials can be writ on the head of a pin (with room to spare) tries to ""adapt"" a book to The Big Screen; to ""adapt,"" one must be ""adept."" At writing. You with me on this so far? Let's take, as an example, Richard Matheson's excellent end-of-the-world shocker, I AM LEGEND. Three times, now, it's been ""adapted."" Not once correctly. Three times at bat, filmmakers have tried to ""rethink"" Matheson's masterpiece- and failed miserably, this last time being (all things considered) the worst of the lot. (Why worst of the lot, you ask? Because they had more than enough money to do it right- unlike the first time, when the filmmakers were forced to literally leave the country to find a place where it could be shot for ****s and giggles, or the second time, when a pair of writers who should've known better tried to ""rethink"" the story. And it was this ""rethought"" version the makers of #3 drew on when they lensed their loser.) I've wandered afield a bit, here. We're not talking about a novel, nor even a ""real book."" We're talking about a poem with pictures. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I happen to love SHREK: Rufus Wainwright's show-stopping rendition of Leonard Cohen's haunting HALLELUJAH still gives me chills when I hear it- and the second installment is just as good, in its own right. As are the two TOY STORYs (the second of these being my favorite). Disney's PINOCCHIO is a work of art; as is LADY AND THE TRAMP. WALLACE AND GROMIT, THE PJs, CAPTAIN SCARLET (the original series; I've yet to see the second). HOODWINKED was entertaining. So was ROBOTS. But HORTON HEARS A WHO is so chock full of banal, clichÃ©d, unfunny prat falls and ""contradictory"" lines that it's hard to imagine anyone finding it even mildly amusing.",/review/rw2024994/?ref_=tt_urv
