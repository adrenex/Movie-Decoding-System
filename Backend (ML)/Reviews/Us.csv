","I think this was probably the most ""fun"" Iv had watching a movie in a while. It was just like a pure popcorn movie but done really well.",/review/rw7140880/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2021,A_Different_Drummer,5," Takes a major talent
","To ruin a film with such a strong cast, but this proves that a really bad script and clueless direction can do it. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

24 October 2021,Leofwine_draca,4," A disappointment
","This looked good from the trailer but the film itself let me down. The script is poor and way too derivative and the over the top comedy is way out of place given the violence elsewhere. The story is too obviously copied from JOHN WICK and the substitution of the library for the hotel doesn't really work or feel legitimate. Some solid acting talent is present here but Karen Gillan has bitten off more than she can chew as the lead and her doubling is too obvious and too often. Some good fight choreography is lost between the over editing and over cutting. Overall, I expected more but didn't get it from this film.",/review/rw7140880/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2021,BA_Harrison,5," Not as tasty as it sounds.
","Like its title, Gunpowder Milkshake comprises of two ingredients: OTT girl-power action and calculated coolness. The problem is that writer/director Navot Papushado only gives us a single scoop of each, and doesn't blend them together very well. A double-scoop of crazy action (actually, make that three scoops, heaped), thoroughly whisked together with several scoops of innovative style, and the results would have been much more tasty.",/review/rw7140880/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2022,fischer_patrick,6," John Wick Rip Off, but sort of fun
","The film gets no points for originality as it's John Wick with girls. That being said, if you like action movies, it's pretty fun. Karen Gillan was good. Not a great movie, but I'll definitely tune in for the sequel. Worth a watch if you are a fan of the genre.",/review/rw7140880/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2021,brentage5000,8," Why so much negativity? This was a banger!
","Ignore all the negative reviews on here. This film is exactly what it says on the tin -- essentially, a female John Wick -- and it owns that. The dialogue is snappy, the performances are winking, the actors are having fun, and it's generally just a good time. If you enjoyed Keanu Reeves checking into a hotel with an infinite amount of magic coins and using all sorts of code words for guns to avenge his dog, you can handle Karen Gillan doing the same with classic works of literature to protect a little girl.",/review/rw7140880/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,kosmasp,9," This milkshake will kill the boys in the yard
",I understand that certain things and beats do not work for everyone. And even if you are a fan of the actresses involved you may not be entirely convinced by what you see here. Especially if maybe your favorite female actress does not get enough screen time or something else you'd wish or don't get in the movie.,/review/rw7140880/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2021,jakethesnake-42007,7," Brainless fun and that's what I loved about it
",Ok is this movie great no it's not but if you turn your mind off and just go with it it's a lot of fun.,/review/rw7140880/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2021,ravencorinncarluk,4," All style, zero substance
","I really liked the cast, though I disliked how the director had Karen Gillan tying to be too deadpan and badass in the first act. It made her seem like a poor actress, but I've seen too much of her so I know it wasn't her fault.",/review/rw7140880/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2021,UniqueParticle,9," Lots of fun I'm surprised this wasn't better received
","Gunpowder Milkshake is beautiful, I crave the amazing cinematography and to top it off the action is awesomeness! Girl power movies are usually so damn good I'd say 65% of the time. The music is god tier throughout I really like it! Karen Gillian is perfect as a professional killer. I don't use Netflix as much as most but I wish I saw this sooner.",/review/rw7140880/?ref_=tt_urv

19 September 2021,huh_oh_i_c,8," A choreographic masterpiece. Pays hommage to Sergio Leone, John Woo & Tarantino
","Gunpowder Milkshake, a title which isn't directly explained in the movie, is an action movie which borders on the action-comedy, but it doesn't cross that line entirely.",/review/rw7140880/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2021,paul_haakonsen,7," Highly enjoyable action movie...
","Well, I must admit that I was having a bit of expectations to the 2021 movie with the odd title ""Gunpowder Milkshake"". Why? Well, simply given those that were on the cast list.",/review/rw7140880/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2021,rsvp321,," Just a very badly made movie :(

1 August 2021,Prismark10,5," Gunpowder Milkshake
",Gunpowder Milkshake tries too hard to be a stylised female John Wick. It needed more inspiration instead of ripping off Hong Kong action movies.,/review/rw7140880/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2022,Xstal,5," V for Vendetta...
","Plundering a variety of genres and copying who knows how many forefathers, the traditional roles reversed but the plot as thin as skimmed, leaves a sour taste of disaffection and inequality.",/review/rw7140880/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2022,witra_as,7," Derivative but stylized visuals
","Derivative action thriller that cribs from all sorts of similar movies. Navot Papushado successfully staged a series of fluid, violent, stylized visuals to keep us interested. Gillan and all these women could be your favorite badass female protagonist.",/review/rw7140880/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2021,T2TLED,8," Kinda fun

28 November 2021,pietclausen,8," Now that's what I call a movie!
","Not expected much about the title of this 2021 movie, giving the impression of a stupid action comedy, I was pleasantly surprised that it was nothing of this sort. It's a 'serious' movie, well-acted and directed with a lighthearted touch and good quips here and there. Anyone wanting to see a movie with shooting and gore, this is it and more! Thoroughly enjoyable drama and fun, fit to watch by everyone. I can safely say this movie was the best I've seen since the corona virus devastated the movie industry almost 2 years ago.",/review/rw7140880/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2021,theshiptons,8," Don't shoot I'm only 8 and 3/4s
","In this age of movies with strong female roles this was well constructed as an action movie with well developed characters that you can root for. The plot was ok if not predictable. There is a lot of blood and gore kills so not one for the kiddies. This is weird as there is not a if any swearing in this film. My only issue is that of the interplay between the mother and her adult child is very stilted and slows down the pace of the movie. Come on we don't need a pause to catch our breaths here, get on with the murdering gals.",/review/rw7140880/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2021,lu_lou_belle,1," A montage of 20 years of action movie trailers, devoid of life.
","Michelle Yeoh, Lena Hedley, Paul Giamatti, Angela Bassett and other talent wasted. Not sure which bold assassin with a heart of gold movie this is supposed to be ripping off but there's a little Kill Bill a little John Wick, and so so many video games. My attention began to wander after 5 minutes. Editing of action sequences leaves alot to be desired, as does incoherent script, set design and directing. Actors do spend alot of time standing around and sneering between action sequences, except for Carla Gugino who is pleasantly adrift on painkillers and a little ecstasy, Mona Lisa smiling through it all. Once again, another script that misuses dialog to explain and describe plot as it happens, rather than embue it with life-always an indicator of incompetence. I think they might have recycled the library set from the beginning of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen toward what feels like the end but isn;t. You will not notice since you will probably be asleep. The waste of Angela Bassett is particularly frustrating. I can't remember ever seeing her in a film where she didn't light up the screen, even in genres that I dislike. Film is too long by at least 45 minutes, and is rotten as a women centered film, proving once again if you're going to perform in a traditionally man's genre exceptionally wonderful is your minimum standard. The producers and director let these vibrant actors down. Well its july 2021, covid delta is running rampant so finding quality on the netflix is a bit of a challenge. I wonder what Criterion has going on...

22 July 2021,nogodnomasters,8," Don't worry about the bullets
","Sam (Karen Gillan) is a hit person for ""The Firm"" abandoned by her mother (Lena Headey) who is also an assassin. Sam fills her mission, but in doing so takes out the son of a rival group that is ready to go to war. Her next assignment has a hiccup and she ends up on the lam with a little girl, hung out to dry. Sam seeks the help of the Librarians, a group of women who are also trained killers and whose function is a bit of a mystery.",/review/rw7140880/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2021,matt-233-497899,5," Kinda silly. (minor spoilers that don't ruin the ending)
","Everyone in America has a gun, except half the henchmen in this movie. And if your job is guarding a literal armory under attack by a busload of them, why would you pick an ax and a chain to fight off a busload of them? And bright red Porsches are apparently hard to see in nearly empty parking garages. I had high hopes with so many excellent actresses in one film. Unfortunately the writing was hokey and didn't give them much to work with. I have no idea how the producers got so many big names to go along with this. The cast was the only reason I didn't rate this movie a 3.",/review/rw7140880/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2021,Tweetienator,4," Milk Gone Sour
","A stylish and well made but nevertheless rather boring affair. There are some really good and some solid female assassin movies around (Salt, Kill Bill, Anna, Hanna, LÃ©on: The Professional, Atomic Blonde, Point of No Return just to mention a few) but unfortunately, Gunpowder Milkshake does not belong to them. This little flick is a redundant, forgettable piece, a series of already known scenes and ideas, and even the solid working cast can't save or disguise the generic story. Again the incompetence of the writing staff is to blame for a missed opportunity. Anyway, some action scenes are fun, so I wouldn't call Gunpowder Milkshake a total failure.",/review/rw7140880/?ref_=tt_urv
