18 April 2006,garrard,," A show that deserves a larger audience
","Airing on UPN, Chris Rock's ""autobiographical"" sitcom doesn't get the viewers that it so richly deserves. Besides being one of the best acted series in production today, the show has a stellar writing staff that supplies not only laughs but biting commentary about society, the mark of a good production team.",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2005,SonicStuart,10," A show about Chris Rock's childhood
","""Everybody Hates Chris"" is another one of the best new comedies of 2005! The show is about Chris Rock's life as 13 year old and how he thought being a teenager was going to be fun when it turns out that it wasn't what he expected it to be and it shows on how he grew up in Brooklyn, New York with his younger brother and sister and his strict, hard-working parents. At first when I heard about this show I thought it was going to be a show where Chris Rock was playing a TV sitcom dad or something. It's really funny! Chris Rock is in the show but he is narrating the show while Tyler James Williams plays the 13 year old version of Chris Rock. Looks like UPN could have hit with this one. This is a hilarious show about most of Chris Rock's childhood life. At first when I read about this show before I saw ads for the show, I thought it was going to be a typical sitcom where it's based on a comedian who's a family man or something similar to any other sitcom that revolves around a comedian, but this is more original.",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2007,KUAlum26,," No,Chris,everyone DOESN'T hate you...
","...in fact,I'd say that most people who get to know Chris Rock should end up loving him. Or at the very least,liking him.",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2006,imdb-8212,," Almost EXACTLY like the real thing!
","This show had me laughing out loud in several spots throughout the season so far. It's set in Brooklyn in 1982 and follows Chris Rock and his Stingy penny pinching dad, his nickle millionaire mom, his younger ""better looking"" brother, and his bratty little sister as they try to fit in in a better neighborhood. It's not The Jeffersons, but more Good Times with most episodes covering conflicts within school or kid social interaction.",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2020,nilsonsc,10," One of the most popular comedies in Brazil
","I really love this show. The characters are really well developed and memorable. It's quite funny how famous this show is in Brazil. I've asked a lot of people from other countries, and it's mostly unknown by them, while here most people know their catchphrases by heart. I think this is explained by three factors:
1. It was broadcasted by an open channel several times per day for years, and we don't have many good content available on TV;
2. Brazilians can really relate to the situations lived by Chris and his family. A lower middle class family trying to survive lack of money, prejudice and other adversities of life in a very positive way.
3. The dubbing of this show is REALLY good.",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2018,tomfsloan,9," Extremely Creative
","Lots of shows are funny, but few are as creative as Everybody Hates Chris. There are countless segways, not unlike Family Guy, but these are live action. Not easy to produce in a weekly series. And thank you Chris Rock for using one camera as opposed to three cameras in front of a live audience. And also for your witty narrations. Especially when he refers to himself as now being famous. Every actor and character is full of personality. I wish the show ran longer.",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2006,bookertkilla,10," Everyone loves Chris
",This show should be called Everyone Loves Chris because Chris Rock is the funniest comedian alive.This show is what was missing on our TV's. We needed a family comedy sitcom that is a bit offensive and racial.When I first saw this show I thought it was so hilarious but as it goes on it keeps getting funnier and better.Chris Rock is the only guy that can find something funny out of his old horrible past.E.g. He make jokes about racism and him getting beat up when it actually happened to him.If he turned this show into a drama it will be just as good it will be full with emotion and pain.But this sitcom doesn't focus on the pain.It makes us look at the funnier side of life.,/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2005,General_G,," Better then I Thought.
","Finally, Chris Rock came out with something funny and finally UPN has a great show! I love Everybody Hates Chris. I'd say its better then Everybody Loves Raymond. Classic black comedy. Its a good thing Chris didn't take this to Fox or they would have canceled after two or three episodes because they don't know what there doing. So far the second episode is my favorite. That crazy guy who kept saying fool was funny and that guy that was on fire, literally! I love stuff like that. Comedy you don't have to think about. Just some guy running down the street thats on fire and you cry laughing because its so funny. I hope they have plenty of that in this show. Way to go Chris Rock!",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2010,dee.reid,10," ""Everybody Hates Chris,"" except me, that is...
","I'm just going to get this out of the way: comedian Chris Rock is probably my favorite comedian of all time. When I was 14 in 1999 and although my mother was initially against it, she eventually caved and let me buy Chris Rock's hit comedy album ""Bigger & Blacker,"" and it's probably my favorite spoken-word/comedy album. When I heard that Rock was going to be behind a semi-autobiographical show about his early life growing up in Brooklyn, New York, I got all giddy with excitement.",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2005,flex498,," I LOVE Chris
","Tonight I saw the first episode of ""Everybody Hates Chris"". It is the first time I have seen a ""situation comedy"" in years that made me laugh aloud. I do not recall there being any laugh tracks which can be so annoying, especially when the track is the only laughter.",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2005,drtturner,," Funniest show on TV........period!!!!
","I've seen two shows and it is decided that It is my favorite comedy presently. I didn't even think I would like it. Pam is great in her understated role of Chris's mother. In actuality, no one really hates the boy, although it would be a comical spin seeing that there are some kids who teachers and neighborhood adults hate and chastise for no apparent reason. The father, best known as the Jungle Fever muscle man from White Chicks does his usual visual comedy. The theme song ""EVERYBODY HAA ATES CHRIS"" is adorable and peppered throughout the show at cliff hangers right before commercials. As the show gets slammed by critics I see it as a gem that appeals to me taste whereas Everybody Loves Raymond never did. I could so relate to the coach who heavily woos the young strapping buck to be the star player as it happened to me at age 9 with basketball 15 with wrestling and even 19 with the military track and field team. I was laughing out loud as the coach hunted him down. I look forward to seeing more episodes of this.",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2006,bob the moo,," Series 1: A great sitcom set in a convincing world with wit, imagination and a refreshing lack of sentimentality
","Recalling his childhood experiences growing up in a black neighbourhood in Brooklyn, comedian Chris Rock narrates this comedy series. Growing up is never easy but in Chris' case it is even harder because he has to attend a 99% white school a long bus ride away; his father works two jobs and tries to save every single penny that comes his way; his mother is tough and domineering; his younger brother is cuter and more popular than him and his baby sister is pretty much his responsibility but takes every chance she gets to land him in trouble.",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2006,ian-purnomo,10," Move Aside Cosby!!
","I love this series! At first, my friend told me that it's the visualisation of Chris Rock's stand up comedies. It got me thinking if it's still going to be as funny as what I listened. But yeah it is. It delivers and delivers well indeed.",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2021,matthewtessnear,9," Under-appreciated Sitcom
","This short-lived show based on Chris Rock's adolescence is underrated and talked about far less than it should be among sitcoms of all time. The casting is impeccable, the characters are relatable, and the storylines are spot-on takes on the 1980s that hold up firmly today.",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2020,bluesavage-59002,10," Julius is my senpai
","This show is amazing, I love it the cast is perfect. I love the comedy, and Terry Crews and Tichina Arnold were perfect in their roles",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2005,edesir-1,," Great for kids and good for adults who can relate
","I'm in the same wavelentht with Chris, being 40 and busing to my own ""Corleone JHS"" mines was Brooklyn's Hudde JHS. In reality the crap that Chris would have endured would have been between 1978~80. The racial tension was heavier then. My 14 y/o son enjoys the show and so do I. Why do I think they chose to use 1982 as the main time line? Is because before 82' nothing was really going on in sense of music and fashion. We were more into the funky wear and funky music like the Commadores. Chris does a great job reminding us of what Brooklyn was like. I hope it stays on for awhile.",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2019,thetalich,8," BIIIIIG MAAAAAAAAAAAN
",I think the tittle can work as an review but here is my honest opinion about this show. It's really likeable show. I liked the way how Chris presented his world to us. But we all know that there should be atleast one more season for this show to be complete.,/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2022,SPZMaxinema,9," Let me hold a review!
","The humor in this show is done astoundingly well, both from the narration of Chris Rock AND what actually goes on in the show, plus the cutaways! Mr. Omar, Julius, Malvo, Risky, Peaches, so many memorable characters with great lines and hysterical moments! THIS can make anyone laugh!",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2022,Bonitao,8," For us Brazilians it is unforgettable.
","In the United States, maybe this series doesn't have so many fans, or at the same it is not so recognized, but for us Brazilians born in 90 / 00, this series is remarkable and special, the voice actors did an excellent job and brings a lot of funny dialogues, the situations that Chris and his family go through is a bit of a portrait of Brazil, Rochelle and Julius represent the fathers and mothers of Brazilians very well, that is, all this generates a great identification with the series.",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2009,D_Burke,10," Brilliant Sitcom! Easily Among the Top 10 Best of All Time. Not Kidding!
","When I was in the seventh and eighth grade, if someone were to have told me that Chris Rock was an awkward teenager who was unpopular in school, got picked on, and had little luck with women, I would have thought that someone was crazy. The truth was, during my junior high years, Chris Rock was just becoming nationally known for his raunchy stand-up, and a lot of kids in my class really liked his act and would repeat it verbatim. I still think Chris Rock is funny, but I never knew this other self-conscious side to him which is exhibited brilliantly by actor Tyler James Williams.",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2020,thabaddest-74261,10," Childhood Show!
","I remember coming home every day after middle school (around 2008-2010) and me and my best friend would call eachother and watch this show! We had the biggest crush on Drew! Rewatching this as an adult, I laugh 10x more than I did as a kid. The writing and comedic timing is impeccable. I specifically came here to credit how the show would ALWAYS end in the perfect ""Everybody hates Chris"" moment. No matter how hopeful you were that he'd finally get a happy ending, SOMEHOW something would come at the end and we got the ""Everybody Hates Chris"". It's so easy to start watching this show and finish it beginning to end. I really wished we had more Black shows with good representation like this one. It's really the last of an era and it's heartbreaking. Where's the proud family's, family matters, fresh princes, everybody hates chris's, of this generation? They're all gone...",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2012,momoney94,9," One of the funniest TV series ever made
","Seriously how is this only a 7/10? This is much better than the garbage we have to watch today. I use to watch this as a kid all the time don't know anyone who hated at the time even tho the title was ""Everybody hates Chris""! I mean it had Chris Rock in it as the directer-arguably one of the funniest comedians ever to live. The story was brilliant based around a 13 year old Chris (representing Chris rock when he was a child) who is poor has to live in a poor area of Brooklyn with his 2 younger siblings Tacha and drew along with his two hardworking parents. What really made the progamme stand out was Julius the father of the family played as Terry crews. He played his part so diligently that it made it believable that hulk sized Terry Crew is indeed a poor man working 2 jobs to keep his family surviving. What makes this a classic and up there with the greats i. e Fresh prince of belair, Friends etc. is the laughter. Everybody Hates Chris was simply always funny to watch. Every episode had more unique laughter to bring. So if you didn't get to witness this brilliant show like I did then get watching ASAP wherever it be online illegally! or buying the box-set or maybe You tubing for some episodes.",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2021,goldenawards,9," This series is golden jewel...
","Is a tv show about Chris Rock's childhood,the highlight of this series are the jokes, reference and funny scenes like Chris's father dressed in batman, the set's scenery really looks like the 80's brooklyn, and it shows the life of chris mainly his problems, the whole cast acts well with great performance, but teery crews stand out more, the series has many more good episodes than bad, the adventures of chris with greg really draws smiles and laughter, where they get into various problems and challenges of adolescence, the strongest point of the series is from season 2 and 3, and a series that really needs attention and good indication to be watched.",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2008,Sylviastel,9," One of the Best Shows on Television
","Chris Rock revisits his childhood in the tough part of Brooklyn, New York with Tichina Arnold playing mom. Chris Rock narrates each episode with a great cast including the child actor who plays him. The show is set in the 1980s Brooklyn before gentrification took over the borough. Chris Rock has some memorable stories about growing up like his job at a local convenient store where he discovers the minimum wage is $3.35 and his boss is only paying him $3 per hour to work in the store. He claims that he can't afford the minimum wage so Chris gives an ultimatum. So he loses his job but he does have thoughts about striking and protesting the store owner. There was another episode where he and his brother went to see Wayne Gretzky out on Long Island which was pretty good. This show is an excellent comedy in times when we need to laugh more than ever.",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2008,oakcourt,10," We Didn't See Enough of this in the UK
","I love this series and as I now don't possess a TV am waiting for that well known download shop to load it for sale. It perfectly sums up life in the 70's and although I'm English I come from a similar background. Love the fact that it's not afraid to shock sometimes in its narration . My favourite character is Chris' mum, a good disciplinarian but fair as well. We need more like her today. Chris Rock gets a lot of stick in his stand-up for being basically honest and direct, however that's what's missing these days. This is a piece of TV genius. Finally Chris if you ever log on - FABULOUS SOUNDTRACK!!! You managed to pick the best soul tracks of the 70's well done!",/review/rw1956129/?ref_=tt_urv
