31 January 1999,il_matto,7," Raw emotional power from every performance, beautiful in so many ways.
","This is a wonderful film that showcases not only the music, but also a full roster of powerful performances. Every one is excellent, but it's the two most subtle of them all that steal the show.",/review/rw0545266/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2003,Theo Robertson,8," I Never Thought I`d Enjoy This
","To be blunt the only reason I watched LITTLE VOICE was because there was absolutely nothing else on and I was expecting some sort of substandard Mike Leigh film . And I wasn`t expecting my opinion to be swayed either as the opening credits rolled , based on a stage play and full of actors with "" Eee by gum "" northern accents and with a foul mouthed mother bullying her painfully introverted daughter this had all the hallmarks of a tedious 90 minutes , but the more the film went on the more I became engrossed . I`ve never seen Jim Cartwright`s play so I can`t comment if Mark Herman`s script is an improvement but what a great script it is , something that touches your heart and makes you smile . The scene with LV singing a medley is uplifting while the scenes with "" Take Fat "" and Trigger Smith - Knife thrower will make you laugh outloud . This is a great feel good movie with a great cast , Michael Caine and Jim Broadbent are very good ( Well they do have three Oscars between them ) , Ewan McGregor gives one of his better performances and Brenda Blethyn deserved her Oscar nod , but standing head and shoulders above the entire cast is Jane Horrocks as LV . The fact that she wasn`t Oscar nominated in the title role is one of the biggest travesties in recent academy award history ",/review/rw0545266/?ref_=tt_urv

8 September 2003,ruddy_jim,8," Quirky and Odd, well worth a rental
","A slightly twisted film about a brutally shy young lady (LV), an overbearing cliche come to life mother, a slime ball agent and (of course) a slightly odd, yet kind hero(?) figure played by none other than Ewen McGregor, Little Voice is well worth the rental fee.",/review/rw0545266/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2004,paul2001sw-1,8," Unique
","Mark Herman's follow-up to 'Brassed Off' is another affectionate look at working class English life, although without that film's heart and anger. Instead, it's largely an opportunity for a gallery of British acting talent to enjoy themselves, with Michael Caine, Jim Broadbent and Brenda Blethyn all outrageous in their roles.  Surprisingly, Jane Horrocks, the ostensible star, has a smaller role than might have been expected, although it's hard to think of anyone else who could have pulled off the part.  'Little Voice' is not entirely coherent, a fairy tale without the ending, but it is wholly distinctive and in places very funny.  One of a kind.",/review/rw0545266/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2011,TheLittleSongbird,8," Big talent in an impressive little film
","I was surprised at how much I liked Little Voice. It looks beautiful, with the photography striking and the scenery, lighting, costumes and locations equally so. The script has its funny and touching moments, and I liked how the story had sweet and subtle Cinderella-like undertones. The pace is also just fine, and Herman's direction compliments the film's strengths very well.",/review/rw0545266/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2001,mattgenne,," a review for American audiences
","An absorbing, fanciful, and sometimes astonishing film, Little Voice is a modern fairy tale that owes a bit to both pop psychology and, of all things, the musical Annie. The film thrusts us into the peculiarly flawed world of a young woman still living in her childhood home.  Her nickname, LV (Little Voice) is pronounced in her mother's thick, northern English accent as ""Elvie.""  In fact, her chief problem is her caustic mother, played with tragicomic skill by Brenda Blethyn, who received an Oscar nomination for the role.",/review/rw0545266/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2008,KUAlum26,," Not SO little voice
","Waif-like LV(Jane Horrocks,a revelation!) is child-like,reclusive and almost catatonic,living under the thumb of her blustery,selfish and more-than-a-bit whorish mother(Brenda Blythyn,sucking up as much air as humanly possible). While mum is romancing(more like shagging)the local small-time promoter about town(Michael Caine,able to slip into yet another character with little effort),LV's rich,uncannily strong and facile voice catches his attention,and he sets about to use her talents to hit the big time. One who observes LV--a painfully shy girl who quietly,slowly mourns the death/absence of her father--knows that this course of action is going to be more ruinous than profitable somewhere down the line.",/review/rw0545266/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2005,Stan_Ogden,7," What an incredible performance
","Jane Horrocks! wow - I had no idea that she is such a tremendous mimic. I was slightly intoxicated whilst watching this film, and assumed that they were using the extracted original vocals of singers such as Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland etc. I was gob-smacked when the closing title said 'Jane Horrocks performed all her own songs'. Christ on crutches.. to call her gift 'a talent' is a travesty. Anyway.. about the film. The acting is mostly excellent (apart from LV's mother who goes right over the top in parts.. although she does manage to make you cringe and really feel her desperation). Michael Caine plays a great dirty minded but likable agent character (the man's a god - watch 'Get Carter'). I felt genuinely sorry for LV - a sweet and agonisingly introverted girl with an amazing ability to mimic other singers. Thank god Jane Horrocks isn't as shy as the character that she portrays in this film - it would be such a shame if her gift had never been exposed this way.",/review/rw0545266/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 1999,Hacman,," A wonderful movie, with a few annoying flaws.

7 October 2021,planktonrules,8," A truly unique film, that's for sure!
","'Little Voice' is a nickname given to LV, a seriously mentally disturbed woman. LV doesn't really have much of a life, as she spends nearly every minute in her bedroom listening to old music and fantasizing bout her long-dead father being there listening to her when she occasionally sings. It's hard to identify exactly what is wrong with her without knowing her history, but she appears seriously depressed due to her flat affect and on the autism spectrum...since when she sings, she doesn't sing as herself. Instead, she becomes the person who originally sang the songs...such as Judy Garland, Shirley Bassey or Marilyn Monroe! Part of this might also be because LV's mother is abusive and just god-awful...and retreating into her own reality apparently helps her to cope...just not well. Towards the very end of the film, her mental health puzzle is a bit clearer....but that's something you need to see for yourself.",/review/rw0545266/?ref_=tt_urv

","'Little Voice' is a simply made wonderful movie that revolves around LV, her mother Mari and her boyfriend Ray and Billy. LV spends most of her days in her room listening to old records of Bassey, Monroe and Garland. Her frustrated mother resents her attachment to music and spends her evenings partying and getting drunk. In the meantime, Billy, a young electrician, falls in love with LV. One day Mari brings along her new boyfriend Ray and Ray is introduced to LV. He discovers LV's singing gift and thus starts his obsession to make LV into a star.

","The movie was not known in my philistine city, don't mention the awarded original production on stage ""The Rise and Fall of Little Voice"". To most of my townspeople, ""LV"" forever stands for Marianne's ""Louis Vuitton"" reticules, the association of John Bull's ""Little Voice"" ridicule would never come out, very unlikely.",/review/rw0545266/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2005,sol-,7," My brief review of the film
","An interestingly unusual British comedy, it is not very but funny but it is almost always amusing, despite a couple of silly, even if not dull, romances thrown in. The acting is the department in which the film scores best, with Jane Horrocks excellent as the title character, Michael Caine, who is hardly ever bad to have on hand, and Brenda Blethyn, who generally suits her character quite well, even if she does go a bit over-the-top at times. The rest of the characters played by the other actors are somewhat oddly developed, and it is all rather predictable fluff, but the way light and colour are distributed keeps the film rather fascinating, and it is definitely a good film, albeit not a great one.",/review/rw0545266/?ref_=tt_urv

3 November 2006,jboothmillard,7," Little Voice
","From director Mark Herman (Brassed Off), this is a fantastic British film with some laughs, drama, sentimentality and great stars, based on the stage play ""The Rise and Fall of Little Voice"" by Sam Mendes (director of American Beauty). Basically LV ""Little Voice"" (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jane Horrocks) is pathetically shy and lives in seclusion listening to her late father's old records, this obviously drives her abusive, loud-mouthed mother Mari Hoff (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Brenda Blethyn) to distraction. At night however when her father's ghost (Graham Turner) visits, LV sings the songs of the great divas such as Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe and Dame Shirley Bassey. Mari has a new boyfriend with loathsome dead-end talent scout Ray Say (Sir Michael Caine), and one night he overhears LV's innate talent and sees a big chance for making money. He gets local run-down seedy night club owner Mr. Boo (Jim Broadbent) to hear it to, Say gambles everything and forces LV to appear on stage at the club. As they prepare the event, LV and equally shy pigeon racer and telephone engineer Bill (Ewan McGregor) form a tentative, gentle friendship. LV did have a little bit of a bad start when she could only sing in the dark, but the second night she really goes for it, knowing that she can see her Dad in the audience. At the end of the performance though, Ray, Boo and Mari are all celebrating, but LV has gone back to seclusion and solace, and on the night when big talent agent Bunny 'Starmaker' Morris (Taggart's Alex Norton) will be in the audience. Say loses his rag and tries to drag LV to the performance, to be taunted by her many impressions, and when he survives falling down the stairs, he knows his career's gone, and he expresses this on stage with a fantastic performance of Roy Orbison's ""It's Over"", with some dialogue about his situation thrown in. In the end, after surviving a house fire, LV reveals her real name (Laura) and confronts her Mum Mari about the death of her Dad, and it ends with her helping Billy at the pigeon huts exercising them. Also starring Philip Jackson as George and Annette Badland as Sadie. The play was especially written for Horrocks, so no wonder she is fantastic at being shy, singing as the stars and impressions, Blethyn is also great, and Caine sort of steals the show, a great film. It was nominated the BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Sound. Sir Michael Caine was number 44, and Ewan McGregor number 9 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Caine was number 7, and McGregor number 2 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and Brenda Blethyn was number 19, and Jane Horrocks number 16 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses.

28 May 2003,Idocamstuf,7," One of the sweetest British flicks
","I never thought I would enjoy this movie, but I did.  It tells the story of a quiet and abused young woman who has a hidden singing talent, this is discovered by an agent(Caine), who then gets her to perform in clubs.  This is a very sweet little movie that came as a surprise to me.  Its short and simple, like this review.  ***1/2 out of *****.",/review/rw0545266/?ref_=tt_urv

22 June 1999,Don-102,8," Little Film With a Memorable Voice...
","Mark Herman's LITTLE VOICE is another triumphant Miramax flick, one of those small, artistic pictures that is twice as good as your average brainless cineplex mainstay (Just check the papers).  Its great to see a touching and profoundly amusing film during the most empty and money-making period of the movie year.  Herman writes and directs the film based on a successful play that starred Jane Horrocks in the title role of LV, or Laura, whose mousy voice and meek demeanor plays wonderfully against Brenda Blethyn's powerhouse comedic performance.  Blethyn's Oscar loss is further proof that the Academy Awards can be farce.  Her huge part lost out to an 8 minute job well-done by Judi Dench in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE.  For my money, Blethyn was robbed.  Anyhow, LITTLE VOICE is a breath of fresh air amidst mostly mindless Hollywood fare.",/review/rw0545266/?ref_=tt_urv
