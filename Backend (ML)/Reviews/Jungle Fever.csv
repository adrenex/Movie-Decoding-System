8 April 2020,Ruskington,8," Life's too short to hate Jackass
","I can certainly understand why many people despise Jackass. Essentially, it's little more than a bunch of middle-class American kids goofing around with video cameras and doing some rather despicable things along the way. And yet the show managed to become a huge success, building a worldwide cult following and spawning feature films, documentaries and numerous spin-offs. Jackass is highly entertaining, side-splittingly hilarious and something of a cultural phenomenon. It's also one of the most disgusting, frightening and irresponsible shows ever to hit mainstream television- it's a minor miracle that nobody died during filming.",/review/rw0764782/?ref_=tt_urv

","Jackass is the funniest show ever, that's all I can say.  Just see Chris Pontius turn himself into Party Boy at an electronics store and you'll die laughing.  If you haven't seen this show yet, or don't plan on seeing the movie, then get a nice big set of pliers and remove the plug from your hinea because you don't know how to laugh.  'Nuff said.",/review/rw0764782/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2000,stu-22,," WARNING: DANGER AHEAD
","JACKASS is the most brilliant and idiotic show on television. It's the kind of genius idea one gets while they're half-baked. The best characters are ""Night Monkey"" (Chris Pontius) and ""Danger Ehren"" (Ehren McGheyey). sure people will imitate the things done on here, especially the c**p done by Bam Margera, Brandon Dicamillio, and Ryan Dunn (pushing shopping carts into curbs, jumping off roofs with umbrellas and into bushes, BMX jousting), but that's their own decision. There's plenty of disclaimers calling you a dumbass if you do this stuff. That doesn't mean you have to obey them though, just don't imitate the stuff that could get you killed (Human Barbecue, Alligatorama, Self-Defense). Being a dumbass can be fun. Being a JACKASS is something holy.",/review/rw0764782/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2005,jboothmillard,6," Jackass
","I heard the title of this show many times in my youth (through bullying mainly, which is unfortunate), and then I was introduced to it following the movie. Basically, a bunch of American performers film each other, sometimes with hidden camera, performing stunts and pranks on each other and on the public. The stunts can often involve being injured or doing disgusting things with almost no thought for health and safety, and the pranks are always hilarious to see play out either on the performers or on the public for their reactions. Starring Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Ryan Dunn, Ehren McGhehey, Preston Lacy, Jason Acu√±a aka ""Wee Man"" and Dave England, with appearances from Brandon DiCamillo, co-creators Jeff Tremaine and Spike Jonze (director of Being John Malkovich and Her), Bam's parents Phil and April Margera, Rick Kosick, Chris Raab aka ""Raab Himself"", Dimitry Elyashkevich, skateboarder Tony Hawk, Manny Puig, Rake Yohn, Stephanie Hodge, and Jess Margera (Bam's brother), with guest appearances from Brad Pitt and Shaquille ""Shaq"" O'Neal. Highlights throughout the three series included: Poo Cocktail, Lacy in underwear chasing Wee Man in underwear in many places, Mexican Snowboarding, Knoxville and his erection, Knoxville with two broken arms, Daddy and Baby, the Mullet, Sumo Wrestling, the Goldfish, Knoxville in Mianus (pronounced ""my anus""), the Blind Driver, the Magic Show (Preston urinating), Land Skiing, 50 boiled eggs challenge, Poo Dive, Taxidermy, Stilt Fall, Fisherman's Wharf, the Beekini, Night Monkey, Big Wheel Craze, High Dive, McGhehey tanning the word ""Jackass"" on his chest, Knoxville farting in a yoga class, Bam kicking his dad's ass, Prostitute Boat Race, Street Fishing, Knoxville as a hearse driver with a coffin on a steep hill, Grass Skiing, Mr. Mean the bull, Fat F-word, Egg Nog Challenge, Steve-O having letters stapled on his bum, Santa Colonic, Shopping Carts, Urban Kayak, Pontius rollerblading with his bum showing, the Skunk, Knoxville shot with a crossbow in armour, Squid Suit, Sling Shot Pond, Oogo, Cell Phone, Bread Suit, Extreme Scootin', Aggressive Sledding, California Bobsledding, the Cup Test, Plunger Wake Up, San Francisco Snowboarding, the Worm Trick, Party Boy, Jai Alai, Knoxville artificially inseminating a cow, Margera pranking his dad with a hole in the lawn while he uses the lawnmower, American Werewolf (in London), the Loop, Butt Piercing, Boxing, Antiquing, Bikini Wax, Human Bullseye, Bucket Cars, Human Bowling, the Fire Hose, Stilt Boxing, Blindfolded Skateboarding, Big Wheel Craze 2, Bobbing for Jellyfish, High Dive 2, Ice Blocking, Beard of Leeches, Ice Barrel Jumping, Fat F-word 2, Bottle Skating, Lacy as a builder needing to poop and afterwards shrinking to Wee Man, Office Chairs, Spermathon, Snow Surfing, Metro Bunny, Crapper Sled, the Body Cast, Snow Tubing, Nutball, the Toupee, the Omelette, Bloody Windshield, Playgirl Pontius, Poo Diaper, Backwards Bullride, Chemical Spill, the Magnet Suit, Security Guard, Ice Block Skating, Sculpture Garden, Bloody Carpet, 90 Years Old, Duck Hunting, and many more. The performers deliberately doing things to hurt themselves and each other, often crashing into things, is cringing and looks painful and dangerous, and should not be tried at home. But you cannot help but laugh at it, because the performers all have a great sense of humour, and there are some genuinely ingenious pranks on the public, it is a significant part of in 2000s American popular culture, and a most watchable reality comedy show. The Christmas Special was number 49 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments. Good!",/review/rw0764782/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't care what people say about this show. I get irritated when people say this show is stupid and why would someone do that. How about who cares. Its there show and they can do what they want. I love the show and i own the box set and the movie they made in 2002. My favorites on the show are Bam, Dunn, Dico, Steve-O and Chris. WeeMan is adorable. I just really love this show. If they can get paid for acting stupid let them. I really enjoy the most of it. Some looks gross and painful. The ones where they dive off into the water look fun and i would do it.Most fans of this show are guys. I am a girl and I like it. I have several friends that are girls and like it.

10 July 2005,jellyneckr,," The best Reality TV show ever!
","I'm not a fan of reality television shows. In my eyes, reality TV is the worst kind of television. However, I absolutely love ""Jackass"". One of the first big hit reality TV shows in the 2000s, ""Jackass"" was a controversial from the get go. It was also hilarious, crude, and stupid. The absurd level of crudeness and stupidity is what made ""Jackass"" so great. The stunts performed on the show were outrageous, the antics were crazy, and the cast members were insane. They did things that few people would dare do, especially Steve-O, Chris Pontius, and Johnny Knoxville. The three of them were certainly the most entertaining of the group. Highlights of the series included any segments with Party Boy, the Porta-Potti segments, and any time the boys got on skateboards. Kudos to Johnny Knoxville, Spike Jonze, and Jeff Tremaine for creating one of the best shows ever. It's a shame it only lasted three seasons. I give it 10/10.",/review/rw0764782/?ref_=tt_urv

3 August 2002,Theo Robertson,," Has Its Moments
","JACKASS can best be described as an extreme sports equivilent of TRIGGER HAPPY TV . Various American dudes play pranks on the US public by sticking a doll on the back of a bicycle then crashing the bike in front of passerbys , or rolling up to a gas station , fill their car full of petrol and have a "" sex slave "" escape running and screaming from the trunk of their car , or crash a shopping trolley passenger down a flight of steps . As you can guess it`s a MTV version of CANDID CAMERA or BEADEL`S ABOUT , but JACKASS does have its moments and I did prefer it to TRIGGER HAPPY TV . Though having said that it`s also the type of show that you`ll find yourself getting bored with in a short period of time",/review/rw0764782/?ref_=tt_urv

","Jackass would have to be one of the greatest shows of our time. This is laugh-out-loud stuff because, lets face it, people getting hurt is funny. The other gags (where people dont get hurt) are also amusing. Fun for all the family. Jackass is hard to beat in the comedy/stupidity/vile genre and is only outclassed by the New Zealand show 'Back of the Y' which is basically the same thing only with a (very weak)storyline.",/review/rw0764782/?ref_=tt_urv

","What can I say JACKASS is just damn hilarious, some people, like say my parents may find it down right stupid and well, they're probably not wrong but its still really funny and a cool programme and if people like entertaining people by doing stupid and down right painful things then its up to them.... Johnny Knoxville is the best he may not be the best of actors like Elijah wood!!! But I admire him just as much as I think Elijah wood is cute and that's a lot, anyway Knoxville is my idol I think he's really cool for doing all that stuff, and the other guys on the show too. I don't know if I should call him brave because he doesn't have to do this stuff, then again does that mean he is.... forget that, not brave like say Dave Pelzer (a child called it), but another kind. Well, apart from F.R.I.E.N.D.S and Buffy JACKASS comes next in my favourite programmes list!!!!!!!!",/review/rw0764782/?ref_=tt_urv

","To the guys who make the show--  watching people puke is not funny, punching your dad is not funny, ramming shopping carts into bushes with people inside is not funny, drowning yourself in feces is not funny!  Come on guys, you are showing how ignorant and unoriginal you can truly be. The majority of this show is idiots trying to hurt themselves by trying to ski down grassy hills, getting into shopping carts and having someone run them into things, skateboarding into things, etc...how is seeing people almost killing themselves like idiots funny?  How is humping the back of a shark funny?  How is seeing that nasty Steve guy naked funny?  Amazingly, there are some funny parts of this show.  For example, when the guy is tied up in the trunk, and he jumps out in public and runs down the street, that's funny.  When the guy dressed up like the devil and said he was misunderstood and the stuff said about him was a bunch of lies, that was funny.  As far as I can tell, this idiot, Johnny Knoxville is the main guy on the show, and nearly EVERYTHING he does is moronic and stupid, and it can only be funny to people who have approximately three brain cells left in their head from all the pot they have smoked.  If you want my opinion, there are very few funny parts to this show, and the majority of it is a bunch of ignorant morons proving that they are just that.",/review/rw0764782/?ref_=tt_urv

","Apparently, for not liking this, i'm ""uptight"", ""humourless"" and ""a drag"". Well, i probably am! It takes a lot to make me laugh, and this..this is trash. I have certain standards when it comes to comedy:If it's offensive, please let it have a point to make, (and even then, i remain dubious of it's worth) If someone is humilliated, it is not funny. If someone is in pain, it is not funny. I actually believe that, without the majority of today's ""humour"", the world would be a much more efficient place. ""Jackass"" is a waste of space, a show made made idiots, for idiots. It actually made me want to scream at the t.v to stop, because i saw so many young minds being polluted by this filth. Read a book, don't watch this. If you are a fan, my personal opinion is that you should really question yourself:How on earth can watching stupidity be funny?
