19 September 2019,herrick416,8," Impossible to stop watching ..
","Fascinating and compelling from the first few minutes of episode 1 through the next 8 hours of interest that didn't release me til dawn. Talk about binge-watching without regret that what began at around 8 pm had me watching the sun come up. Now that's the best review I could offer. It was everything I love -a mystery, brilliant detective work and deep characterization that had me knowing and caring about these people. The conversations were quiet and understated without any sort of rehearsed wit that sacrifices authenticity for canned cleverness. No, this was miles above anything I've seen.",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2019,Michael Fargo,10," Unbelievably good
","For me the first episode was tenuous. Kaitlyn Dever carries a very heavy load in the first hour, portraying a teenager with an incredibly complex background who reports that she's been raped. It isn't until the second hour when Merritt Wever is paired with a reluctant Toni Collette as two detectives who, by coincidence, discover they might be looking for the same very sophisticated rapist.",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2019,zacharykieler,10," Extremely Emotional
","This is a hard watch, impressive cast. I binged it in a day but was overcome with emotion. More than a few times. To quote Dexter
""It still comes as a shock when I'm confronted with the depth of evil that exists in this world""
Bless the real cops in Colorado, damn the ones who didn't believe her.",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,9," A very tough watch.
","I wasn't fully aware of the story, but after I watched episode one I decided to look into it, I stuck with it, and I'm glad I did. That poor girl, the ordeals she went through, physically, medically, and psychologically, with those who should have protected her treating her as a criminal.",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2019,typhoon74,10," Netflix did it again - Brilliant
","Just excellent, from start to end. The acting, the story, the directing, the start and the end. Brilliant! I found myself rewinding many scenes just to watch them again due to great acting and dialogue. I usually never do that since it kinda mess up the episode (Im picky), but couldnt help myself.",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2019,sonjamin,9," Wow, powerful series, great acting, tough story to watch....
","As a father this is your worse nightmare you can imagine for your child. The callousness of all those ""who love and support"" the victim was tough to watch. I hope that we have come further along instead of constant victim shaming. Tough watch, but worth it....",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2019,Vic_max,," It's a real story with little fictional padding
","This series is based on a series of rapes that occurred in Washington and Colorado between 2008 and 2011. The original reporting of the story won a Pulitzer prize. The real ""Marie"" has seen the Netflix series and felt that they got it right.",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2019,djxtreme78,10," Award Winning
","Honestly this was the best series I have seen on TV in years . It was perfectly crafted , Acted and Written. I can't give this enough praise , I really do hope it wins an award .",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2019,kartavyaramnani,10," What a fine fine series...
","You will squirm, you will be uncomfortable, you will feel the suspense and you will cry..
That's how powerful and amazing the 8 episodes of this show were..",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2019,Serpico1071,10," Unbelievable..
","This is an amazing mini series from start to finish, very well acted, scripted, produced and directed.. some stellar performances throughout.. i was hooked from the first episode, I couldn't fault it, better than your average routine CSI's or SVU's etc, Netflix has produced some turkey's in the past, but on occasion they give us something that needs praise for, so thank you Netflix for this one..",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2019,mangospider,9," Its interesting
","Looking at the reviews that have a large number of ""not helpful"" votes plus the reviews from guys who are whining about how this is a feminist program- I'm just wondering what's wrong with people. No one is blaming white police officers, it's an indictment of a SYSTEM that did not care enough about this girl to offer her justice (women let her down too). It's heartbreaking and it happened and men who are more upset about maybe seeing themselves reflected in the antagonists in this one story than whether this serial rapist was taken off the streets need to see a therapist.",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2019,yulskliff,10," Amazing!
",I only wish they would have shown all the people who doubted her finding out and their faces of shame.,/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2019,imdb-ikysmoviedatabase,10," Gripping drama
",Really gripping and enjoyable series seen first few episodes and it looks great and the story is building up really well,/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2019,saphira_dragon-80270,9," Excellent show, we binged it in 2 days!
","It's very very good. Fantastic casting! We love Toni Collette and Merritt Weaver. Excellent show, it will have you hooked in right away! Great crime drama, we need more like this!",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2019,gimpchrist,10," Wow, the writing.
","Not often I'm impressed by writing, directing & acting, but holy hell......how explosive is the dialogue & acting? Every woman in this is sharp, strong, and just oozes feminine power without coming off as cheesy or put-on or try-hard. Just a gang of tough chicks obsessed with their jobs. I also mega loved the realistic parenting/homelife stuff with the chick as the head of a household instead of a dude.....these dudes are supportive, loving & understanding but without being emasculated or 'paraded' like some parody character, as most shows do with the stay at home/supporting dad/husband role.",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2019,pietclausen,9," Netflix hits GOLD!
","As a true story this gem is really unbelievable, but truth often is stranger than fiction. This depiction of the happenings was brilliantly done, well acted with an intelligent, down to earth, script. The viewer can really feel part in the happenings.",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2019,FireflySerenity94,9," Unforgettable performances
","The two lead detective roles played by Toni Collette and Merritt Wever are performances I won't easily forget, and are the highlight of the show. Unbelievable has a realistic, real world kind of style to the script which can be dry at times but also adds an extra layer of realism to the show.",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2019,avinashorsingh,10," Incredible
","A must watch. This series is so gripping. The acting, the direction, way of moving forward in the story. A Masterpiece I must say. Netflix finally got this right :))",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2020,Xstal,7," Top Drawer Escalation...
","... had me glued to screen until the last two episodes when the desire to spread the events over far too many adverts became apparent and it staggered to a finish like a marathon runner about to hit the wall. A shame, because the three female leads were exceptional.",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2019,questl-18592,9," Unbelievable
","A powerful and poignant limited series about the impact of sexual assault on the lives of women. Unbelievable is uncomfortable, it's hard to watch at times and it should be. It wants us to have some idea of the nightmarish experiences these women go through, experiences that don't end when the act does. They are scarred by it and the show doesn't hide that.",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2019,xandra-22615,10," A must see
","I created this account just to write this review. This show was, at times, hard to watch because you connect so well with the characters. It transitions perfectly between two story lines never feeling like you are getting cut off too soon. The acting is phenomenal and the message is one that needs to be heard. It does an amazing job of following the article written by ProPublica. I recommended it to all my girlfriends and, only a few episodes in, they are saying the same. Best limited series I've seen in quite some time.",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2019,mapika,10," strong story, great actors, important message!
","Binged it in one. It's very gripping and disturbing.
The first episode i wasn't so sure, if i'd like it. Some parts felt unrealistic and exaggerated. But during the second episode i started to understand why they did it; and therefore i love it again.
i don't know, what more to say without spoiling.
watch it, it's worth your time!",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2020,Maryjnberry,8," This is a Typical case of law enforcement lack of sensitivity
","""Unbelievable"" is a typical case of what happens when male detectives are sent to investigate rape case(s). The fact that the police put Marie, a rape victim through multiple gruelling interrogation sessions, traumatizing her even further, puts this victim on trial before investigating the actual rapist.
In the next scene, the investigating officer is a female detective, handling that rape victim in a totally different way, telling the victim what would happen at every stage of the initial investigation, putting most of the decisions in the victims hands, supporting the victim every moment, taking the facts, never making judgement doing her best to take her statements.
As a society there should be procedures in place to handle these horrible rape and sexual assault cases so that all traumatized victims are supported, rather than putting them through grilling interrogations, making the victim defensive, confused and feeling guilt as if it were her/his fault that this happened, or that their behaviour caused it to happen in some way. Unfortunately, there aren't enough female detectives to take in these type of cases, so women are judged by male detectives as liars or the case is put down as a vindictive female rage after a breakup. We must do better.",/review/rw5124230/?ref_=tt_urv
