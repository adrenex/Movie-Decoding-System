14 January 2002,DunnDeeDaGreat,10," Chris Tucker's best R rated performance
","When I was 14, I first saw Friday and almost choked from laughter. The script by Ice Cube and DJ Pooh is right on target with it's ghetto humor. Another plus point for the film is it doesn't stereotype. But it's Chris Tucker as Smokey who makes this film. His high pitched voice and mannerisms are classic.Hard-core rapper Ice Cube, after appearing in such hard-hitting films as Boyz 'N the Hood and Higher Learning, played his first comic role in this picture he co-wrote with frequent musical collaborator DJ Pooh. Craig (Ice Cube) manages to get fired on his day off (though he claims it's through no fault of his own) and spends the day hanging out with his buddy Smokey (Chris Tucker) and trying to avoid his father (John Witherspoon), who wants him to find another job immediately. Smokey (whose name might have something to do with his tremendous fondness for marijuana) has even more serious problems; he was given $200 worth of weed to sell by Big Worm (Faizon Love), but he ended up smoking it instead, and if he can't come up with the money by the end of the day, he'll be in a world of hurt (and will put Craig in the same place just for being his friend). And Deebo (Tom ""Tiny"" Lister, Jr.), a gargantuan bully who roams the neighborhood on his bicycle, has it in for Craig, while Craig tries his best just to stay out of his way. As one would expect, Friday features a strong hip-hop soundtrack, featuring tracks by such artists as Dr. Dre, Cypress Hill, Mack 10, and Funkdoobiest, as well as old-school R&B selections from The Isley Brothers, Roger, and Rose Royce",/review/rw3637161/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2005,Unbreakable27,," I still pop this baby in the VCR
","Eleven years ago (one year before this movie debuted), if you'd have told me you can get an entire movie from two guys sitting on their porch on a hot Friday afternoon, I'd have said you were nuts.",/review/rw3637161/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2006,tricksixxx,7," You got knocked the F*** out!
","This movie is hilarious! As far as comedies go about the hood, this one is hands down the best. Chris Tucker and Ice Cube really mix up nicely in this one. This is a feel good movie and doesn't glorify the gritty hard reality violence of the inner city at all, but rather focuses on strugglin to make it with good humor and staying positive. Sure they smoke weed all up and down side to side through this movie, but you have to remember that brings a certain audience and humor to it that wasn't present before. This movie is downright laugh out loud caliber. The situations this odd couple is forced into are interesting and very funny. The re-watch value for Friday is tremendous and the characters are beautifully developed. There are some true memorable moments in Friday, and even more memorable characters. This is just a fun movie from start to finish and never tries to be perfect. Thank you for keeping it light, and to the point. All we wanted was some fun and it was delivered with Friday.",/review/rw3637161/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 1999,QKnown,," My favorite comedy of the 90's!!!!!
","Believe me, If you could relate to SMOKEY and CRAIG, then you would see why this flick is so funny!  While Dumb & Dumber and Austin Powers:The Spy Who Shagged Me, had me rollin' at times, it didn't do enough to throw me at that front porch where our two main characters sit and do nothing but get high and jive!",/review/rw3637161/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2000,Quinoa1984,8," One of the funniest films of 1995
","(Re-review in 2015): It's interesting to see how this has been labeled the first ""Hood"" comedy. I'm sure there have been others - though written by, of all people, Joel Schumacher, I've always thought of 1976's Car Wash as the grand-daddy of them. It's also become a benchmark for stoners; for the 20th anniversary, it was screened for a special event on 4/20. Sadly, I couldn't attend full of the green stuff, but it was still an enjoyable experience seeing it again. Not great, but good.",/review/rw3637161/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2004,Sfpsycho415,10," One of the funniest movies of all time!---10/10
","When someone asks me which movie i have seen the most times, i have to answer Friday. I know the movie pretty much verbatim, and have seen it well over 30 times. Chris Tucker is one of the funniest people ever. This is his best performance, followed closely by Rush Hour. There are so many funny moments in this movie it would be impossible to name them all here. My favorites would have to be when Smokey meets his blind date, who turns out to be fat and bald, and the scenes where Deebo confronts Smokey and Craig, played by Ice Cube. The movie has a hilarious supporting cast, including John Witherspoon, Tiny Lister, and Bernie Mac. Critics don't know anything. If you ever have a chance to see this and enjoy urban comedy and Chris Tucker, don't even hesitate to watch. 10/10",/review/rw3637161/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2018,tonysobon,10," A movie everyone should give it try.
","I am only writing this because 7.3 rating is to low for this movie and just to say that you do not have to be black or live in the ""hood"" to like it. Not only is it very funny movie but it has a good message with a very good cast and still holds up 23 years after it came out.",/review/rw3637161/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2006,ShadySovereign,7," I wish my Fridays were like this!
","After listening to Ice Cube's song ""Friday"", I was very curious to know how good the actual movie was. Then when I finally bought the DVD of the film, I was very pleased. The movie was a great comedy, filled with laughs and an interesting story.",/review/rw3637161/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2022,kevin_robbins,10," This is up there with the all-time great comedy pictures and stands the test of time
","Friday (1995) is a classic in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Netflix. The storyline follows a young man who recently lost his job on his day off. His best friend, who spends his days on his porch smoking and selling week, convinces him to help with his drug selling/smoking issues as he owes his supplier money. Meanwhile his father stays on his case to find a job. The young man will try to balance selling weed, smoking weed and finding a job...",/review/rw3637161/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2014,Shopaholic35,6," A cult hit that's not too bad.
",Friday is one of those movies that is pretty pointless but it spoke to a generation. I think the real reason why this movie works is due to the likability of the cast. You can't help but like Ice Cube and Chris Tucker despite them being complete slackers and a bit boneheaded. Their chemistry is great and their comedic timing is solid. The supporting cast also play their individual roles well despite the lack of material.,/review/rw3637161/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2006,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," A bit degrading, but still I have to admit that I laughed
","My sister lent me this movie and told me how funny it was. I even told her that I'm not really into those ghetto type of comedies, that it's a bit racist or stereotype, she's the same way too, but she said that I simply had to see this movie. If I loved Chris Tucker that I should definitely enjoy this movie.",/review/rw3637161/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2022,PedroPires90,8," Lots of fun, great characters
","Even if the plot is not great and a bit eventless, this is a very funny film with many classical lines, scenes that would become classical memes (which we had no idea what it would meant in 95) and really distinctive and great characters full of life and identity. We have even space for some cool editing and unexpectedly nice shots in a couple of scenes.",/review/rw3637161/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2022,Scott_Mercer741,7," (SPOILER!) You chill with Ice Cube and Chris Tucker for 90 minutes....that's the plot.
",Ice Cube/O'Shea Jackson plays down and out Craig who whilst still living with his parents manages to lose his job on his day off and subsequently ends up chilling with his reprobate pot head friend Smokey played here by the endearingly annoying Chris Tucker. What follows is essentially a series of vignettes of comedic antics that happen to these 2 guys as they sit and chill on their porch on a Friday in Los Angeles.,/review/rw3637161/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2020,blott2319-1,3," Unfunny and tedious
","So, let me get this straight, this classic 90s comedy that I've heard people talk about for decades is literally just two stoners sitting on a porch for 90 minutes? Boy, I did not get Friday at all. I suppose there's a semblance of a plot, because Chris Tucker has smoked too much of the weed he was meant to sell so they need to gather $200 before the end of the day. I also recognize that I'm exaggerating about the whole movie being planted on that porch, but there doesn't feel like much movement in the story, and they are constantly coming back to that porch as a sort of homebase. I think my big problem was that I didn't care about any of the things that they were doing. These idiots get themselves into a stupid situation, so it's hard for me to sympathize with the journey they take to get out of it.",/review/rw3637161/?ref_=tt_urv
