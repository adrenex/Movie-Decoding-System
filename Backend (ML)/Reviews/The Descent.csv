1 August 2006,ccthemovieman-1,8," Good Re-Make Of 'Lecter Film'
","This is a very good ""remake"" of Manhunter"" which was the first Hannibal Lecter movie but didn't get the press the others did because it didn't have Anthony Hopkins as the famous criminal. After ""Silence of the Lambs"" became so popular, and the sequel, ""Hannibal,"" it was decided to re-do that first film and this time obtain Hopkins' services.",/review/rw1029669/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2006,theshadow908,7," Great prequel.
","Red Dragon takes place just before the events of The Silence of the Lambs. In this movie, a deranged serial killer is killing entire families every month on the night of the full moon. Jack Crawford of the FBI calls in retired agent Will Graham to help catch the killer. Graham left the FBI after being critically wounded while capturing the cannibalistic Hannibal Lecter. Now, Graham must interview Hannibal, to see if he can shed any knowledge on the case. Meanwhile, the killer struggles with himself when he begins to fall in love with a fellow employee. This movie is closer to Silence of the Lambs than Hannibal in quality and style, and therefore is more entertaining.",/review/rw1029669/?ref_=tt_urv

7 September 2004,Smells_Like_Cheese,9," Better than ""Hannibal"", but not up with ""Silence of the Lambs""
","But it was pretty damn close. ""Red Dragon"" was a great movie to watch. I have to admit that I had my doubts. I heard some bad things about this movie from my friends. I had bought the movie for my mom, and she said just to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. ""Red Dragon"" goes back into the roots that ""Silence of the Lambs"" did. It had high action and drama. I was very impressed. And Anthony Hopkins does a great job as his most famous role as Hannibal Lector. I really have to say that I didn't stick to my friend's opinions. This was a great movie. I would recommend for the ""Silence of the Lambs"" fans.",/review/rw1029669/?ref_=tt_urv

5 October 2008,KillerLord,10," A Very Well Done Prequel
","The Silence of the Lambs introduced to us among the most complicated characters of all times - Dr. Hannibal Lecter, brilliantly played by Anthony Hopkins. The portrayal was so strong that one would have felt that there was a need to remake the Manhunter and so it was done - The Red Dragon is worthy remake this time with Anthony Hopkins in another brilliant portrayal as Dr. Lecter. But this movie is different from Silence of the Lambs in many ways. I would not prefer making the comparison and lowering credit for this movie because it is different from the Silence of the Lambs.

20 January 2008,The_Void,7," Nothing on Silence of the Lambs and the novel it's based on, but a decent thriller in it's own right.
","After the return of the infamous Hannibal Lecter to our screens in 2001 with Ridley Scott's film version of the best novel in Thomas Harris's Lecter trilogy, it's not surprising that a new version of the first novel in the series got an update a year later considering that it's previous screen version, Michael Mann's Manhunter, doesn't fit in with the other two films in the series. I do have to say that this version is both more true to Harris' novel and an overall better film than Manhunter; though it does have numerous shortfalls and has nothing on the masterpiece 'Silence of the Lambs'. The plot is quite similar to the one in Silence of the Lambs, and features a cop on the hunt of a serial killer and receiving help from the incarcerated Hannibal Lecter. FBI Agent Will Graham, the captor of Hannibal Lecter, is called out of retirement to help catch a serial killer dubbed ""The Tooth Fairy"" by the media. The killer has already slaughtered two families and the FBI believes that another one is soon to join them; meaning that Will Graham has no choice but to ask Hannibal Lecter for help with the case.",/review/rw1029669/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2015,TheLittleSongbird,8," One of those rare instances where the remake is almost on the same level as the original
","Of the Hannibal Lecter films, the best will always be The Silence of the Lambs to me, a masterful film and one of the best of its genre. Red Dragon is a remake of the 1986 Michael Mann-directed adaptation Manhunter and also a much more literal adaptation of the book, and again from personal opinion both are very good films, Red Dragon being one of the rare instances where the remake is almost on the same level as the original(though the two have components that are both better and worse than the other). All three films are vastly superior to Hannibal and Hannibal Rising, both of which were disappointing.",/review/rw1029669/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2002,badguy-1,8," Not as good as ""SILENCE..."", but better than ""HANNIBAL"".
","Only having seen ""Manhunter"" once, years ago, and not remembering much about it, I won't attempt to compare that film to it's remake, ""Red Dragon"". I've also never read any of the Thomas Harris novels that they are based on, so I won't compare them to the books either. But I will compare it to the other, more recent films in the Hannibal Lecter series, ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Hannibal"".",/review/rw1029669/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2002,Bgb217,10," Excellent film, also an excellent adaption of the book.
","Well I finally saw Red Dragon, and having the book be one of the best I've ever read, I was wary of seeing it. I never really cared for Manhunter, but boy did I get a surprise with this version, a version that actually cared enough about the original work to call it by that name, obviously Red Dragon. I also thought that they would change it around to put more of everybody's favorite cannibal in, which they really didn't. So he's in the beginning more, but that was what basically happened in flashback in the book, they only drew it out more in the movie. And the other scenes with Hannibal that were added helped to cover all the ground they needed to do with the story, and they worked perfectly. Let me explain.",/review/rw1029669/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2002,rosscinema,6," Not bad but nothing special
","You can't help but to keep thinking of Manhunter and I went into this film thinking what did they have to offer that the first version didn't already do on another level? Well, it is more faithful to the book. There's no denying that. But Manhunter is clearly a much more superior film. Lecter's role is of course expanded and thats okay but lets compare the rest of the film. Edward Norton and William Petersen. Petersen's Will Graham is a very complex person with psychological problems and his family also suffers because of it. Norton's version has none of that, he's just dutiful to his job. Mary Louise Parker as his wife just sits there and nods her head! Where was the development of her character? The biggest flaw for me was Ralph Fiennes as Dolarhyde. Fiennes is really not very tall. In fact when he stands next to the wee Emily Watson he's not that much taller. Tom Noonan was a much better Dolarhyde. He stands like 6'7"" or something, a real monstrous presence. Fiennes is maybe 5'9"", MAYBE!! And now to Brett Ratner. He does a decent job here but does this film have any real style or vision? Not really, and we all know Michael Mann is a genius with his visionary style. Noonan's character was a real monster. Fiennes seems to come off as just a kook. While I didn't dislike this film, it just seems to be made by the numbers. It looks good, has great actors and is faithful to the original story. But where is the heart and vision? Manhunter had all of that, and more.",/review/rw1029669/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2015,drqshadow-reviews,6," Appropriately Dark, Gory and Violent, It Also Feels Strangely Empty and Trivial
","A very loyal, by-the-numbers adaptation of the first Hannibal Lecter novel, strangely saved for last in the Anthony Hopkins trilogy. It's about as direct a cut from page to screen as I've seen, which is refreshing, but something about the mood doesn't feel right. This is more of a procedural thriller than a psychological one, and that's fine if the screenplay is able to adjust appropriately. Instead, it keeps trying to push both sets of buttons, which makes this feel like two different movies under the same marquee. The lead casting is regrettable - Ed Norton feels flat and babyfaced as troubled ex-detective Will Graham and Harvey Keitel is terribly misplaced as Jack Crawford, his stiff supervisor - and even the more dependable act isn't completely up to snuff. Hopkins is a mild disappointment in his final turn as Lecter, over-enhancing many of the nuances that had always made him so harrowing in the role, and it's a reach to buy this as a prequel when he's so visibly aged in the interim. Ralph Fiennes is excellent as the madman Francis Dolarhyde, though, and Philip Seymour Hoffman nails his small role as a smarmy, mouth-breathing tabloid reporter. The film is mostly played for fan service, honestly, and at that it's generally very successful. It's far from essential, though, which is a shame. This could've been so much more with a better director and a few alternate casting decisions.",/review/rw1029669/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2013,JohnLeeT,10," Incredibly Poignant Performance of Stunning Power by Emily Watson
","Red Dragon is a good film made absolutely fantastic by a beautifully moving and powerfully stunning performance by Emily Watson. There are scenes in this movie that can never be forgotten once viewed, such as the sight of Ms. Watson's face as she listens to the heartbeat of a sedated tiger. It is nothing less than wondrous in that she makes us share her amazement as if the stethoscope was in our own ears. There are too many scenes of such magic to mention in the space of this modest review but Watson is spectacular in every one in which she appears. It is essential to mention that no other actor in history has played the part of a blind person with such perfection, such astonishing honesty, such absolute spot-on power as Emily Watson does in this film. Though she is not technically the star of the film, it is she who undeniably shines the brightest. The viewer is moved from tears to laughter by her performance and it is acting of such beauty that it will stay with you the rest of your life. She has set a standard that few, if any at all, actors can ever approach let alone touch. Those who see Watson on stage, in film, or on television share a common bond of feeling privileged to view such greatness. Whether the lead role or in a supporting one, Ms. Emily Watson stuns audiences worldwide with every performance and is recognized by everyone as the most talented, most artistically gifted actor working in any medium today.",/review/rw1029669/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2010,saadgkhan,8," Hannibal legacy Continues
","RED DRAGON - CATCH IT ( A- ) Red Dragon is an intriguing prequel to the Silence of the Lambs. The story and serial killer (Red Dragon) in the movie is really intriguing and thrilling. Hannibal Lecter is such an iconic character that we always wanted to see how he got caught and who did it. There is very interesting relationship and chemistry between Anthony Hopkins and Edward Norton's characters. Though, its nothing as compare to Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster's chemistry but still much better then what was between Julianne Moore and Anthony Hopkins in Hannibal. Anthony Hopkins was Outstanding as Hannibal Lecter as always, it's astonishing to see that with how much ease and relaxation Anthony Portrays Hannibal Lecter. He is scary and captivating & when he is on screen you just can't take your eyes off him. Edward Norton did a fantastic job by standing next to him. But this movie completely belongs to Ralph Fiennes, he was incredibly creepy and brilliant. Watching him in Red Dragon is simply great; I don't think there is anyone else who could have portrayed Red Dragon. The chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Emma Watson is captivating and one of the best parts of the movie. Emma Watson as a blind woman did a incredible job. Mary-Louise Parker & Philippe Seymour Hoffman did a respectable job. Director Brett Ratner presented the movie in very intriguing and captivating way. It's nice to see a director doing completely different from its famous genre. the only flaw in the movie I found was the Cliché and quick ending of Red Dragon's character, I think it could have been little innovative and mind boggling. Nonetheless great movie, which bind a spell while watching it!",/review/rw1029669/?ref_=tt_urv

2 October 2002,tinmra,9," This first serving of Hannibal may prove to be the best
","The movie going public is obviously well acquainted with the most famous serial killer, cannibal, in cinematic history, Hannibal Lecter.  In 2002's 'RED DRAGON,' Hannibal is back with force and vengeance, thanks to the brilliant portrayal of Sir Anthony Hopkins and inspired writing of screenwriter Ted Tally.  He's got some of the best lines in the business. 'RED DRAGON,' for the most part is a remake of Michael Mann's 1986 'Manhunter.'  Obviously there isn't a lot of variation between the two since they are both adaptations of Thomas Harris' book 'RED DRAGON.'  But that is were the simularity ends.  Sure, some scenes are structed the same, but to be fair this latest installment is closer and more true to the novel.  For those that read the book or saw 'Manhunter,' it's no surprise that Hannibal had a rather small role.  Ted Tally took some license and beefed up the character for some crucial scenes, adding a very interesting and inventive twist.  From the onset, we see the capture of Hannibal by FBI Agent Will Graham, played flawlessly this time around by Edward Norton.  We are also privy to a rather more intense Lecter, anger and resentment for being caught and put away.  Hopkins doesn't need to do much to convey his distaste for Graham, the true talent of an excellent actor.  Lecter is not over the top as many say he was in the third film 'HANNIBAL.'  But this is really not a Lecter story.  It is focused more on Graham and the new killer on the block, Francis Dolarhyde (played to an eeriely perfection by Ralph Fiennes).  One not of advisement, if 'The Silence Of The Lambs', or 'Hannibal,' gave you nightmares, you may not be prepared for 'Dragon.'  It is absolutely brutal in it's visuals and psychological mind games.  Dolarhyde, aka the 'Tooth Fairy' is a brutal serial killer who has killed two families and may be on the hunt for a third.  It is this that brings Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) on the quest to seek out a retired Graham.  Reluctantly, Graham decides to help with the investigation.  Graham does possess a certain gift, he can think like the killer.  But it does cause a dilemma.  The one person that could really give our detective the insight he needs is the one man who tried to kill him, Lector.  As Clarice in 'Silence' Graham must once again delve into Lecter's world of the asylum.  Frederick Chilton is back as the head of the asylum, again played by Anthony Heald (the 'old friend for dinner' guy).  Heald is an absolute delight in a awkward sort of way.  He's definetly a one off.  Basically, he's not nearly as smart as he thinks he is.  Possibly the most disturbing character of the film is played by Fiennes.  He is essentially a sympathetic killer, and yet you really want to see this guy go down.  Fiennes is stunning in this role and adds his own spark to the role.  Emily Watson plays Fiennes uninformed love interest who happens to be blind, lucky for her.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is the sleazy tabloid reporter who in time is destined to get his comupance.  It is really unfortunate that the Academy Awards does not hand out status to ensemble casts.  If they did, 'RED DRAGON,' would probably be the only nomination in the catagory.  There hasn't been a cast like this in many years.  There is an equal balance between the three main characters, Lecter, Graham, and Dolarhyde.  Lecter was in it just enough to keep it constantly fresh and on edge.  Dolarhyde takes it over the edge and Graham brings it subtly back.  Brett Ratner as the director did an excellent job in setting the scenes, the creepy atmosphere, and letting the actors do what they do best.  This film is a winner all the way around.  If any thriller were put up against 'Silence,' this may be the one that could surpass it in regards to thrills, chills and just plain excellent storytelling.  Though the 4 movies are destined to be lumped together, 'Manhunter,' 'The Silence Of The Lambs,' 'Hannibal,' and now 'The Red Dragon,' which is completely understandable, 'Dragon' stands on it's own.  And does so extremely well. This movie is obviously not for everyone.  There is graphic violence that is disturbing.  Yet in this vehicle it is not overplayed as say, your average slasher movie.  If you're going to plunk down your hard earned cash for a movie, 'Red Dragon,' is the one.  It is a good solid interesting movie that never lets go.  Once it's got you, it's got you.  And that ride starts as the lights in the theater go down.  There's not too many movies that can boast that.",/review/rw1029669/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2005,kgprophet,4," Why bother with this remake?
","I avoided this film in the theatre, as well as the last sequel ""Hannibal"" (see my review). This time I waited until I could check it out for free at the library. This film is almost a shot-by-shot remake of ""Manhunter"", a far superior TV movie by Michael Mann (""Heat"", ""Collateral""). Even worse, this version fails to achieve some of the high points compared to the original. This film is just as worthless as other hack job remakes like ""Point of No Return"" or ""The Vanishing"". Those films were made because the original was a foreign language. The excuse for this film is to feature Anthony Hopkins selling out as the Man in the Cage, and also some nudity (because they CAN).
