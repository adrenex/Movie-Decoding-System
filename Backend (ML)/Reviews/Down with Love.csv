19 October 2017,planktonrules,8," The acting and direction were pretty amazing....
","Tonight I went to the opening night film at the Philadelphia Film Festival and it turned out to be ""I, Tonya"". I wasn't particularly thrilled about this, as I really didn't care much about seeing a biopic about Tonya Harding. In hindsight, I am glad I saw it as the film was exceptionally well directed and the acting was occasionally brilliant. In particular, Australian actress Margot Robbie was simply amazing as Harding-turning in the sort of performance that could mean an Oscar nomination. Likewise, Allison Janney was amazing as wellplaying Tonya's incredibly despicable mother. You really have to respect the great job both of them did in the filmas well as Robbie's learning to skate well in order to make this movie.",/review/rw3860952/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2020,AlsExGal,8," On paper it just didn't appeal to me...
","... because I just remember everybody actually involved being so unlikable. This caustic true-story comedy-drama tells the story of Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie), the champion figure skater who came from a hardscrabble background, raised by an abusive mother (Allison Janney), but overcoming the odds to rise to the top of her sport, only to see it come crashing down thanks to the criminal activity of her dim-witted husband Jeff (Sebastian Stan).",/review/rw3860952/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2017,rockman182,8," I, Tonya (2017)
","I think this film may have had the best trailer of 2017. I saw it and knew instantly how badly I wanted to see it. I've never been a fan of Margot Robbie and her previous acting efforts but this looked like her awakening and where she would be proving me wrong. I believe it, she's quite sensational in this film. Her dedication to her role shows but really everyone involved has done very well. Craig Gillespie has his first real winner with I, Tonya.",/review/rw3860952/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2018,jon.h.ochiai,10," Not a monster...
","""I, Tonya"" is amazing. Margot Robbie gifts a career defining performance. Margot plays disgraced 1994 US Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding. Her performance as Tonya is fearless, vulnerable, sad and poignantly flawed. Harding is notorious for knowing about the attack upon US figure skating Champion Nancy Kerrigan which led to her eventual ban from competitive skating which was her life.",/review/rw3860952/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2018,inikim,8," Relevant movie
","Why relevant? Until I saw this movie, in my point of view Tonya Harding was a cheat and a lowlife and this was entirely based on the media coverage of the events in 1994. Having seen the movie I feel ashamed about how easily I judged her and I realised I have to be way more careful in forming my opinion about people.",/review/rw3860952/?ref_=tt_urv

25 November 2018,claudio_carvalho,8," Based on a True Story
","""I, Tonya"" is a biographic film telling the story of the notorious American figure skater Tonya Harding, brilliantly performed by the Australian actress and producer Margot Robbie. The dramatic and heartbreaking storyline is supported by magnificent screenplay by Steven Rogers that combines dark comedy and docudrama and fantastic music score. The truth behind this story only Tonya Harding knows. But the film is engaging and promotes Tonya Harding to viewers that do not know her sad biography. My vote is eight.",/review/rw3860952/?ref_=tt_urv

","If I could have voted online for the best movie that I saw at TIFF 2017 (the voting was limited to iPhone and Android users), it would have been for this film, which wound up second in the People's Choice award competition. Director Craig Gillespie has tackled a difficult subject brilliantly without removing the considerable number of warts from the main characters. This film should garner a considerable number of Oscar nominations, including best picture and director.",/review/rw3860952/?ref_=tt_urv

","Do you want to be shocked? Here goes: ""I, Tonya"" is a great movie. That's right. A film about a tabloid scandal in the world of women's figure skating is not just a good movie, it's a great one. I cannot think of any other film that made me laugh out loud and cry so hard, and to do both at once, in reaction to the same scene.",/review/rw3860952/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2018,Lejink,8," Ice Ice Baby
","As much as I knew about the ice-skater Tonya Harding was her association with the Nancy Kerrigan incident at the Winter Olympics and her being the only American woman to, up to that point, successfully pull off a triple salkot in competition. I know that she was disgraced as a result of her at-a-distance connection to the Kerrigan assault but that she'd come back into the public eye, competing recently in the American version of ""Strictly Come Dancing"". So what an eye-opener this low-budget feature was.",/review/rw3860952/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2021,UniqueParticle,10," So damn enjoyable!
","Well deserving of award nominations years ago, highly entertaining and perfectly story driven! Craig Gillespie created such a captivating piece of cinema with an exceptional soundtrack that flows so well with everything. The cast is gold too I love Margot Robbie and Paul Walter Hauser along with everyone else. The abuse is sad though but I'm sure it's based on real events.",/review/rw3860952/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2017,ggallegosgroupuk,7," Tabloid Times
","I was going to make a list of people who made extraordinary things during the same period that Tonya Harding monopolized the headlines but then I thought it was a pointless exercise. Charles Manson will always be more famous, much more than Sharon Tate. That's the world we live in or maybe it always was. The sadness verging on horror of of the Tonya Harding story will win, fascination wise, than any kind of kindness from anyone anywhere. Now that out of my system let me say that I Tonya is an entertaining harrowing tale directed by Craig Gillespie and his extraordinary cinematographer Nicholas Karakatsanis with, clearly, Martin Scorsese in their minds and hearts. Margot Robbie is terrific and Sebastian Stan as the husband from hell, superb but it's Allison Janney that creates a character that is impossible to take and irresistible at the same time. She is spectacular. So, that's more than enough to recommend I Tonya but if the Tabloid Times is something you subscribe I will highly recommend Gus Van Sant's To Die For and Michael Ritchie's made for television The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom.",/review/rw3860952/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2020,michaelRokeefe,8," Better than expected biopic
","An unsuspected entertaining glimpse at the troubled life and tainted career of ice skater Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie). Her doomed career destroyed by the intervention of her ex-husband and one of sports infamous scandals: the attack on her rival Nancy Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver) leading into the 1994 Winter Olympics. The skating scenes are commendable. Miss Robbie's efforts may have been her best so far. And Allison Janney as Tonya's mother is a character very easy to dislike...for a long time. Also starring: Sebastian Stan, Bobby Cannavale and Paul Walter Hauser.",/review/rw3860952/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2018,Sylviastel,10," We will never know the truth!
","The Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan scandal of the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Olympics was the biggest ratings winner for the ladies short program. 24 years later, the world has changed and moved on. The figure skating world had other scandals but none topped the Harding-Kerrigan saga. Nancy was Olympic bronze medalist from 1992 and Tonya finished fourth place. Tonya would have probably been okay if she hadn't an abusive ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly in her life. She married him to escape her abusive mother (Allison Janney earned an Academy Award for her performance in this role). Tonya's life was one tragedy after another. She should have been removed from her mother's care as a young child. She was neglected and abused since she was a young child. Tonya's relationship with her mother, Lavona, was abusive and dysfunctional. Her father abandoned them and he was the fifth husband and her fourth child. She was a chain smoking waitress who worked hard to put Tonya through skating lessons. Tonya was a high school dropout with only figure skating on her mind until Jeff entered her life. Margot Robbie escapes into the role of Tonya Harding as a believable tragic figure skater. The film is about Tonya Harding's life not about Nancy Kerrigan. After the scandal, figure skaters earned a lot of money as a result by performing for television specials. If you have any prejudgment about this film, you need to see for yourself and decide for yourself about what really happened in 1994.",/review/rw3860952/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,7," I, Tonya flows as swift as an Olympic figure skater.
","Have been anticipating this release for quite some time. Why? Well I love a good biopic, the cast immediately attracted my attention and it's figure skating. Not often you see an ice skating film. Thankfully, this was bonkers and I loved the fact it was crazily stupid. Tonya Harding was famous for being a bad tempered figure skater in the 90's. This biopic triple axels (oh God I'm too good...) into her family and marital relationships, as well as exploring ""the incident"". A timely release considering the Winter Olympics, showcasing the grace and endurance required for figure skating. Pushing the sport aside, the focus is primarily on Tonya and her marriage to Jeff whilst intertwining her tough upbringing by her mother. Seemingly Tonya is portrayed to be spoilt and a fame seeker, but I consistently sympathised with her. Her pure skating talent being diminished by judges due to her presentation skills and media attention to the sport. It's a harsh reality, and the film made me feel for her. Played eloquently by Margot Robbie who was able to capture both her solid exterior and emotional vulnerability. Allison Janney was outstanding as the straight talking mother from hell who just loves to throw kitchen utensils at her own daughter (seriously...what the hell). I wished the story delved into their relationship further, just so she could have more screen time. Sebastian Stan also deserves recognition as he conveys both anger and love perfectly. Gillespie's directing style was interesting. Some nice one take edits and the figure skating segments were electrifying, albeit with a noticeable green screen. They tried too hard changing the traditional biopic formula by making it quirky. Consistently breaking the fourth wall, mixing narratives, embedding an interview with a linear plot. It works, however the constant use of these grew tiresome especially for a two hour runtime. Having said that, the plot never skates on thin ice and glides along swiftly. This is Robbie's baby, she and the film deserve recognition.",/review/rw3860952/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2018,matthewssilverhammer,9," I, Love, This, Movie
","I, Tonya treats the story of Tonya Harding as if you already know the punchline, and you probably do. It doesn't build up to the ""incident"" in climactic mystery-drama style, like some sort of ""Memento on Ice"". Instead, it focuses on correcting the public consciousness of an uncomfortably complex figure. It isn't a single-minded recreation or a myopic vision of an easy character. It's a celebration of the ethically grey, allowing the bigger truths to shine through the conflicting details. One of the most stylish, energetic, and hilarious films of the year, I, Tonya is a stone-cold scorcher.
A biopic of Olympic-skater-turned-American-pariah Tonya Harding, we're given a fully-formed view of what made the superstar one of the most controversial people in sports, and one of the most compelling cultural characters ever. On simple filmic levels (perfect performances, fun long-takes, seamless ice skating cinematography), it's nearly impeccable. The film glides along gracefully, before repeatedly being hit by a baton of style, violence & unique honesty. Using conflicting first-hand accounts, recreated interviews and fascinating fourth-wall-breaking, it manages to make a ubiquitous news story an eye-opening experiment of stylish filmmaking.
Not that the style is mindless pretension. All the kinetic editing and unique writing play into the real point: that truth is more complicated than heroes and villains. Harding worked hard, tried to dress the part, piled up the makeup to hide her bruises (both literal and figurative). Yet no matter how she changed her image, she couldn't change others' perceptions, or even the truth of who she was. She was human. She was complicated, and so was her story. And I, Tonya treats her with that respect, all while staying endlessly entertaining.",/review/rw3860952/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2018,bkoganbing,9," What did Tonya know and when?
","Comparisons come to mind when thinking of both Tonya Harding and this excellent film about her life and that notorious incident that led to her disgrace
and banishment. The film is done almost as a homage to the faux documentary
style that Gus Van Sant used in To Die For which was based on the Elizabeth
Smart story. Both even had Australians as protagonists, Nicole Kidman for the
Van Sant film and gloriously memorable Margot Robbie for I Tonya.",/review/rw3860952/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2018,phd_travel,7," Still a fascinating story
",Margot Robbie is a terrific actress - eminently watchable. But she is bit too mature and large for the role of Tonya Harding. When she and Sebastian Stan as Jeff Gilooly take over from the child actors they look ludicrously too old. But then the whole movie is done in an over the top parody style so I guess it's forgivable. ,/review/rw3860952/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2017,Turfseer,5," Janney shines as ""mother from hell"" but Robbie as ""trailer trash"" skating champ is all wrong for the part
","I, Tonya, is director Craig Gillespie's take on the mercurial rise and fall of Tonya Harding, the figure skating champion who threw away her career through her association with an abusive ex-husband. Gillespie tells Harding's story through a series of interviews with the principals, most made up to appear how they might look in the present time, speaking directly to the camera, and insisting that their version of events is the correct one.",/review/rw3860952/?ref_=tt_urv
