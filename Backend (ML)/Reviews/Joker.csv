14 January 2004,Reynolph,10," Reminds you how good TV can be
","Once in a while, there comes along a TV drama series that makes you glad the medium was invented.  A series that makes you glad to be alive; a series that breaks your heart that you have to wait a whole week to see the next episode.  Shameless is such a series.",/review/rw0999442/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2020,liberty_lee,8," Surprised and I really like it
","Never watched this until now. I'm pleasantly surprised because I thought it would be something I would have on in the background while I was on my phone. Turns out I really like the characters! Some good actors in the programme and likeable characters. Mostly all abit fantastical but fun nonetheless. You get to love the characters and feel joy and sadness with them, feel like you know them. Lots of stuff happening all the time, people coming and going. David threllfall is very good.",/review/rw0999442/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2004,BlindLemonPye,10," As good as TV ever gets
","I'm not a great authority on this, as I hardy watch TV any more. If they came up with more stuff like this, I would be addicted to the Box. Fantastic script, characters and acting and the funniest, freshest British made comedy I've seen since Spaced and (to a slightly lesser extent) The League of Gentlemen.",/review/rw0999442/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2005,prose,10," This is what TV is about........
","""Shameless"" began a couple of nights ago on SBS TV - supposedly an ethnic channel (are Mancunian's ethnic, then??) - in Australia, with no warning, no fanfare. I was blown fair out of my chair by this show, and possibly appreciated it all the more because I had no expectations, although once I noted Paul Abbott's name under 'writer' I knew I was in for something special. His scripts for 'Clocking Off' and 'Linda Green' were, like 'Shameless', both sharp and original. Dialogue is quick and relevant, characters are drawn immediately, and altogether the script treats the viewer as an intelligent participant in the hilarious, and often poignant, exploits of the Gallagher family. Dad Gallagher, always a bit the worse for wear on drugs or alcohol (or both) is raging around the room talking rubbish, and Fiona, eldest child, explains to her posh boyfriend that her Dad's ecstasy dealer is a schizophrenic, like that explains everything. Perhaps it does...... If you get the chance to see this, then don't miss it.",/review/rw0999442/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2013,tequila101,10," It was the Best Show Out
","What I am doing reviewing each series for how they did and their downfalls. I will be deeply analyzing Shameless, and the end I'll simply place a verdict.",/review/rw0999442/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2005,dmcslack,," Fabulous television
","I love television. Watched it since the late '50's and enjoyed everything, even if I hated myself for enjoying it. However, there are shows that stand out and Shameless is one of them. I think that Alan Clark produced some of the best drama on British TV, even including Ken Loach and Dennis Potter. On comedy, the UK has birthed or succoured a comprehensive list of talented writers that Greece was not ancient enough to pre-empt. Shameless is brilliant. It is Ken Loach and Ian Pattison (Rab C Nesbit) in concert, it is Dennis Potter and the Pythons. David Threlfell plays Frank Gallagher, a wastrel philosopher whose genes will inherit the earth. His family are an absorbing, entertaining, sensitive magnet for our attention and affection. They are challenging and rude, but I'd live there, it is urban Manchester and welcoming. Forget the comedy for a minute and I'm most reminded of Alan Clark's 'Road'. Threlfell and Maxine Peake ( the best in ' dinnerladies ') are like Dudegeon and Horrocks. They provide adult acting and the rest of the cast are not far behind. If you do nothing else on a Saturday night, buy this DVD. It will brighten up your life.",/review/rw0999442/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2018,brannanlove,6," Could have been one of the greatest shows in british TV history
","The first four seasons of shameless were unbelievably brilliant. A northern working class family living on a rough council estate in Manchester. After that it declines immensely. By time it gets to season 11, it is complete garbage. Shameless used to film on an actual estate in Gorton, Manchester up to about season 4/5 when they moved to a custom built set due to problems filming because of the shows popularity. The problem with this, is that it's clearly a set. It's so noticeable that the set doesn't even try to resemble the layout of the estate. The shop is clearly behind the Gallaghers house, where as before it was about a mile away. There is houses across from the Gallaghers that were not there before. It's ridiculous. The biggest problem with this show though is the mysterious disappearances of cast members without any real mention of where they have gone. Debbie, Ian, Liam, Carol, Jez just name a few. The cast becomes almost unrecognisable. The first few seasons is about the real nitty gritty of northern working class life. After that, stories become pathetic like an episode where Frank and Monica are talking to there newborn baby through telepathy. Bottom line is that this show had the potential to be one of the greatest shows British TV has ever seen but rather than end it about six seasons before they did. They prolonged the agony of a once great show.",/review/rw0999442/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2005,Jessiclair,," Vital, visceral, poignant, all with perfect comedic timing.
","From the very first episode you will be drawn into the lives of each of the principal characters - warts and haloes and all. Each is fully realized with a light and dark side, shown incrementally and alternately through their actions and their reluctantly expressed concerns. The story lines are both outrageous and  once you spend a few minutes with this family  absolutely believable, and move at an enervatingly brisk while gratifyingly even pace. I'm so glad I found out about it when Series II had already completed, and could enjoy it from episode 1.1 through the end of series II. While it seems evident that Series III will commence with casting changes, this production is so incredibly well planned (unlike most U.S. series - Lost, I'm looking at you) that the story arc girds you quite well for even fundamental shifts, and instills great anticipation. The show addresses immediate, on-the-ground social issues like complacency vs. poverty, avarice vs. honor, cheating vs. work (and stealing vs. profit), lust vs. love, and 9 times out of 10 the virtuous parts of humanity are exemplified and enjoyed (but always with the other side engaged and/or confronted in the process). That 10th time is where Frank comes in. Paul Abbott is a brave artist, a brave man, and a brave son. Never has such a reluctant father been so well-realized and so generously presented. Now. When do we get Series III?",/review/rw0999442/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2005,Stuey-4,10," Absolutely marvellous
","I can't comprehend how people can give this a bad review. It is without doubt one of the best shows on the TV and is comparable to Nighty Night, League of Gentlemen and possibly Little Britain, when it comes to blacker than black humour. The characters are sublimely developed with Frank, the hapless father being one of, if not the main character. He is a horrible man with questionable morals and less than a day's work behind him in his life. He has 8 children to support and is supported himself by his beautiful yet eccentric wife. It is Franks tale of partying, avoiding work and generally being the worst father in the world. If you don't like this, you don't know what's funny.",/review/rw0999442/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2004,paul2001sw-1,8," Work is the scourge of the drinking classes...
","Paul Abbott's last drama, 'State of Play', was an ultra-serious (and ultra-good) political thriller.  For this, his follow-up, he has made what at first viewing appears to be a bizarre choice, making a drama about working class life that superficially resembles an extended version of Harry Enfield's 'Slobs' sketches, only with added sex and violence.  But as you get used to the program, its appeal grows.  Human stain Frank Gallacher, the awful family patriarch, rumbles on in the background, pretty much ignored by everyone else, who've all rumbled that he's just a waste of space. Meanwhile, they try to make the best of what he has left of their lives. Fast paced and funny, it's infinitely more entertaining than stolid dramas like 'Family Business' (screened at the same time on another channel).",/review/rw0999442/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2005,duke92278,," Another hit from the UK. Thank god for BBC America!
","I happened upon this show one afternoon while nursing a hangover and have been hooked ever since. I was also lucky that BBCA was playing the entire series 1 as a marathon that day. This show blows away any of the lame crap that they call TV over here and is another testament to the vastly underrated talent of the UK. The only way a show this ballsy would be shown over here would be on a pay channel like HBO or Showtime. I am fast becoming a huge fan of British TV (Eastenders, The Office, Coupling, Father Ted, The Green Wing, ABFAB) and hopefully the DVD will be available to us yanks soon. Let's just hope some stupid network (NBC) doesn't get ahold of it in an attempt to ""Americanize"" it like they tried with Coupling and The Office.",/review/rw0999442/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2020,gibbs-18172,8," Party... But Scatter way before Series 10
","It's amazing how quickly TV evolves and its easy to forget the trailblazers who lead the way.
Paul Abbots Shameless hit UK homes in the early noghties on typical Channel 4 audience figures. By the last episode everyone was talking about it. People at least had a peak at it.
It received admiration as much as it received complaints, fact was the perfect portrait of the northern underbelly.",/review/rw0999442/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2005,martin-520,10," Some people just don't get it...
","Co-written by the writer behind 'Clocking Off', This is one the most stand-out, must-see series British television has produced. The exploits of the Gallagher family are no-holds-barred and guaranteed to either offend the viewer, or cause them to slide off their chair and roll around the floor, laughing their behinds off.",/review/rw0999442/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2013,Howlin Wolf,9," Started shameless, ended somewhat cowed and chastened
","I've seen every episode, accepted the downturn in quality (you have to, it's inevitable standards will fall after 9 years ) but still enjoyed most of it. The finale was OK, nothing more than that. They whitewashed Franks character; growth would have been OK if they hadn't tried to do it within the space of a third of an episode ",/review/rw0999442/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2004,indiglo_milo,10," Top Stuff
","Definitely the best series i have ever seen on TV. Non stop Laughing all the way through. the realism of the program is great and allows a lot of people to actually relate to it. i would recommend everyone should watch this and hopefully enjoy it as much as i have. the characters are fantastic, frank is hilarious! there are also the characters who you befriend throughout the series, like Lip and Ian. the story lines have been fantastic and each one has left you wanting to see what happens in the next episode. this program is a definite 'thumbs up' and hopefully there will be a second series with all the same characters, because i am sure people would welcome the return of the show.",/review/rw0999442/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2020,hillman_mcfc,9," One of the Great British series of all time
","The original and best version of Shameless is of course the British version. Frank Gallagher will be remembered as one of the best UK TV show characters ever. It's maybe not on the top with the likes of The Royle Family, Only fools ect but it just thithers underneath it. The first 5-6 seasons are brilliant but as they usually do it starts to fall off at the end..it did go on for 11 seasons which is a tad long for what it is but non the less a great series that the US version couldn't hold a candle against.",/review/rw0999442/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2004,dirkwombatslayer,," Unashamedly brilliant!

11 April 2010,last-picture-show,3," Shameless is now worthless.
",As an avid viewer of Shameless since series one I have noticed a gradual deterioration of the quality over the last two series (my rating is for series 6 and 7). I have now reached the point where I can no longer bear to watch wondering what horror show they will put on display next.,/review/rw0999442/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2006,mulhollandman,," The Best thing since sliced bread

This is one of the best ever T.V. shows ever made , it should in all fairness have stopped being produced after series 7 or 8 at the latest given that the family it centered around was disappearing leaving Frank with little Stella the rest gone.",/review/rw0999442/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2006,pottyboy44,," fabulous
","unbelievably well thought out drama. the grim setting against a council estate in manchester is juxtaposed brilliantly with the warmth of the characters, who are fantastically well-acted. the story lines are well thought out and the issues well-observed. and it's so bloody funny. i've never been taken by soaps, every one has left me cold apart from shameless. but this here, this is eastenders for a new generation. quality quality quality. so much so that it has inspired my first (and no doubt last) post on this forum. two last points: do not listen to the one negative review. look at his/her profile. every review out of hundreds is negative. does this person not have anything better to do that sit about whinging about things? secondly, great to see some American shameless fans. there are some out there that 'get it'. spread the word my friends. and to the big American corps... by all means take the name and the concept and do your own thing with it. that's just more money in channel 4's pocket to keep on producing masterpieces such as this. i salute you channel 4.",/review/rw0999442/?ref_=tt_urv
