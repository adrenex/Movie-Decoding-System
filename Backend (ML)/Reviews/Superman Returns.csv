7 August 2022,kevin_robbins,7," This movie has several original concepts that I really enjoyed
",Moloch (2022) is a new release from the Netherlands currently available on Shudder. The storyline follows a group of researchers who uncover a fossilized woman tied to a legend near a bog. Shortly after finding the corpse a house near the bog starts having visitors and portions of the legendary story starts happening all around the family in the house. The legend may play out at the family's home if the scientist and family doesn't work together to stop it.,/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv

",This one landed at a solid 6.5 for me and I decided to round up to a 7 as I am a bit biased towards folk horror.,/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,TerribleKatherine,8," A Lot Better Than I Thought It Would Be
","It's nice to see a competent horror movie for a change, nowadays most horror movies seem to rely solely on exposition for dummies and jumpscares, which I hate. This movie doesn't waste it's time on anything useless, it's a well paced movie with a great atmosphere. It takes some time to build up and you won't guess the ending. The ending almost reminds me of a masterpiece called Hereditary by Ari Aster. The acting was flawless and there were some very competent moments of cinematography. I sincerely recommend watching the movie. Forget about the lame blockbuster like the Nun or the Conjuring and choose this instead.",/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2022,isaacmizrahii,8," old school, mythological horror
","It's funny how some reviewers write about 'cliches' here...what, in this day and age, hasn't borrowed from the past?",/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2022,markvanwasbeek,8," I liked it
","This was better than expected. I was expecting a more Dick Maas kinda horror, since Dutch horror movies are not known for their finesse. But this would be a pretty decent Hollywood movie, so for a Dutch production: bravo! I am also in love with Sallie Harmsen now <3. Be sure to check it out when it hits Netflix or sth! 8/8,5.",/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2022,MaesterOfWargs,8," Refreshing, creepy, great folk horror story
","If you're hesitating, just watch this film. It has a little bit of a slow build up but then provides a really unnerving folk horror payoff. I'll be thinking about Moloch for a while.",/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2022,lallolu,8," Very good storyline
","I was hesitant to see this but I am glad I did. It has good storyline, although I wouldn't call it terryfying though. It will be perfect for people who wants to be a little scared, but not terrified.",/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,Reviews_of_the_Dead,8," Review for Moloch
",This is a movie that I saw popped up on Shudder. It went on my list of ones to check out for my year-end list. I heard good things from podcasters regarding this one as well. The week that I saw it was one where nothing new was coming to the theater so I made this a Featured Review for Journey with a Cinephile: A Horror Movie Podcast.,/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2022,Coventry,8," The Moloch-cocktail: 2/3 fascinating Dutch Folklore, 1/3 genuine suspense
","Sadly, it doesn't happen very often, but sometimes a horror movie can surpass your already high expectations. That's what I had with the Dutch folklore horror tale ""Moloch"". Many ancient pagan tales and myths originating from North-East Holland are grim and unsettling, but for some reason there don't exist many movies/TV-series about these (yet).",/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,avindugunasinghe,8," Excellent Story!
",Moloch digs up a forgotten theme with a set of familiar scares. A well written folk horror story. Complimentary performances by the cast solidifying the conclusion of the movie. Moloch's subliminal message may hint at a vengeful spirit which lives through vessels and keeps reclaiming what once snatched from her. It's a clever story!,/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2022,SyamRawk,7," More than a horror
",This movie really took me by surprise. At the beginning it looks like an ordinary typical horror movies but it's not. The storyline is great until the end. The plot twist is unpredictable. Great acting. Really recommend this movie. Well done.,/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,danko-o,9," Close to perfect
","The music and the atmosphere are really the cherry on the top, but it's the plot twist that makes the movie. I just wish it was just a bit better communicated, who the secret good guy is, to fully enjoy (or better said, notice) the twist.",/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2022,gab-67599,7," It Was Good
","As a fan of horror and Shudder films this was one of the better movies they have made so far. I would have enjoyed it more in English, but I will take what I can get these days. I will say the story was a little hard to follow, I thought the two old couple were together but apparently that was his daughter? It was a bit slow at times and by the time anything interesting happened it was over. So if you do not like slow paced, subtitle reading, confusing storylines of a movie. Then this will not be your cup of tea. I do recommend if you enjoy horror though, it was a good B movie.",/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv

28 July 2022,killercharm,7," great Dutch folklore horror
","A family living by the peat bog, where everything is mummified, have a visitor to contend with, he somehow gets into the house. He doesn't come alone. This is a good fright and a story well told. The suspense is gripping and the scares are good and convincing scary. When finally they're in the safe bosom of family there's still the twist!",/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,Diogo-S-F,8," Paranormal and psychological horror, no blood - 'Sugar packs'
","The Dutch country ambience somehow adds to the eerie atmoshphere, particularly the local idiosyncrasies, fears and people. The discovery of ancient mummified women in the area gives rise to the suspicion of a very old - now defunct - cult affecting all in a family line. The main character ends up accepting her destiny as 'it is'. She has a little a daughter. Deals with demenoloy, legends and curses - to be accepted with reserve.",/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,coldembrace619,9," Browsing Netflix and Shudder? Give this one a watch.
","This is just a well-rounded horror flick. Its not really gory so skip it if you need blood & guts. However, it is dark, eery, and tense. Much keeps you guessing, and the ending wraps up the film very nicely. Overall this is a creepy film that is well acted, well written, and well shot.",/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2022,Victor_Fallon,7," Folky-Dokey.
","This is strictly in the folk horror sub-genre, so don't go in expecting a slash-em-up. It takes a novelistic approach with a handful of characters who make unusual discoveries in a nearby peat bog. It's about 'digging' around for the secrets of the past and the consequences they have for Sallie Harmsen and her family.",/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2022,paul_haakonsen,4," Slow paced atmospheric horror movie...
","Never having heard about this 2022 Dutch horror movie titled ""Moloch"" before now as I happened to stumble upon it, so I didn't know what I was in for here. However, it being a horror movie that I hadn't already seen was essentially sufficient for me to opt to sit down and watch it.",/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,kosmasp,8," History repeats itself
","No pun intended - and you will know where this is heading fairly early on. Still this is not so much about where it ends up (and it is quite clear where it ends, even giving you the visual clue in case you missed the other clue at the cafe - give me some sugar and all that), but how it gets there. And there is a lot of tension and excitement along the way.",/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2022,movieman6-413-929510,2," creative use of Dutch elements, but also a lot of reuse of horror clichÃ©s
","Moloch is a new horror film directed and partly written by Nico van den Brink. For this film he has only directed short films. This is his first directing work for a film that lasts longer than an hour. The film is about Betriek (Sallie Harmsen), who lives on the edge of a peat swamp. Strange things happen in the neighborhood where she lives, from a dead person to strange figures that walk around her house in the evening. Betriek goes to investigate, to discover what is going on. Together with the foreign agent Jonas (Alexandre Willaume), she learns about the mythical history of the peat swamp that is bewitched by an evil spirit, who harass surrounding residents with her presence. Together, Betriek and Jonas must try to stop this evil force before more victims fall. With this film Nico van de brink tries to make a real Dutch horror film, which makes use of typical Dutch features such as the Veen. They use historical elements such as the story of the girl from Ede. They manage to incorporate this element in the film in a creative way, but otherwise they copy many elements from other horror films. These copied moments come from lesser-known horror films, but a horror connoisseur can still recognize the moments. For them, this film is so familiar without really creating tension. In the end, it can come off as a long-winded movie. Nico van den Brink and co-writer Daan Bakker should have come up with more unique horror elements of their own, to have had a more extraordinary Dutch horror film. The visual effects are often not believable. For suspense it works better if the ghost stays in the background or in the darkness, but when the ghost comes into view more clearly you can see that this was placed in the film with CGI. This lowers the credibility and subsequently the tension level. The props they use for the bog bodies seem credible, but unfortunately little is done with them. Due to the quality of the film, the acting isn't really special either. Sallie Harmsen and Alexandre Willaume do well as the lead roles, but sometimes the film seems to be more about their relationship than the mystery of the peat swamp. The rest of the film cast also doesn't get much material to work with in the film and come across more as extras to produce the story.",/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2022,stellabruggen,10," A blisteringly good, terrifying folk horror
","I can't believe something this fantastic has been made in Holland. I'm Dutch and we are generally awful at movie-making... But this was maybe the best scary movie I've ever seen. Completely terrifying, and the plot is so good that it took me a while to connect all the SEEMINGLY loose threads afterwards, which was well worth it. Extremely rare to see such a good story paired with perfect execution. Not a dull moment for those willing to pay close attention.",/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2022,BandSAboutMovies,6," Moloch
","Betriek and her family live at the end of a peat bog - a near-swamp - in the north Netherlands, a quiet place broken up by an attack by a random stranger one dark night. Why? The answer to this will obsess her and take her to places darker than she may ever want to go.",/review/rw8379929/?ref_=tt_urv
