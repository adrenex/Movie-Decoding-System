27 August 2022,surfingnaked1,10," Something good for a change
","Didn't know what this was all about but I like rob and Ryan so I thought I'd take a look. Have you seen what's on tv now, scripted reality, stupid tv. I can't even watch most of it. I started watching the science channel for something good. Then I watched this and I saw the heart and soul of so many people, real people and I was hooked. The heart. And the should of all the people was awesome , nothing scripted here. I love the fact hey have to subtitle the welsh people so the Americans can understand them. So far everyone has been upbeat by all the people, REAL PEOPlE!! So wish Ryan and bob the best and I will watch every episode .",/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2022,steve-marcus26,10," Where can I buy Wrexham AFC merch? I just became a fan!
",Just wow. This series takes you into the lives of everyone involved and makes you actually experience what they go through. This is absolutely incredibly well done and cannot wait to see the team climb higher and higher up the pyramid.,/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2022,HelloBlockbuster,10," Only Ryan Reynolds
","Okay, docuseries are like snoozefests to me-usually. On top of that, my initial impression was this was gonna be a rip off of Ted Lasso, but I gave it a shot. Then, as Ryan and Rob are talking on the field in the first few minutes I'm thinking ""they're not scripted at all, seems like a normal convo"".... ""Oh wait, they're using their real names? I need to google this sh-."" Turns out these two geniuses actually purchased this soccer team in 2021 and decided to document the process from the very beginning without ever meeting one another in person before. Mind blown. So yeah, this isn't some Ted Lasso rip off or a crap docuseries. Sure Rob is cool and funny, but seeing just how the heck Ryan gets into these off-the-wall ventures is what has me intrigued. Aviator Gin, Mint Mobile, a Football Club... talk about diversification. I'm thoroughly enjoying watching this and I'm only 15min in to episode 1! I had to pause and get on here to share so anyone wondering if they should watch it could get their sign from me-THIS IS A MUST WATCH.",/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv

",When I was a little girl I loved soccer and loved Wrexham. As time went on my tastes changed and soccer wasn't so important.,/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2022,mpd71,10," Awesome ( from a 51 year old lifelong supporter)
","Maybe I'm a little biased because I live in wrexham (and I'm a season ticket holder) and i live about a mile from the stadium as the crow flies and can see it from my bedroom , but the show is great . 2020 was a strange year for all but when news broke about the takeover and it was all a bit surreal and people genuinely thought that someone taking the piss . However , here we are ....... my biggest fear was that we were going to be made to look like idiots and it would be a bit of a piss take . However, less than 12 months into the takeover is was more than obvious to us fans than these 2 were deadly serious and put their money where their mouth is so to speak and they were doing the things that any football fan would expect or wish for from new chairmen and the documentary was gonna reflect this . The show is brilliant to be fair . Its not all about Ryan and Rob as some might have expected but also about the characters in and around the club.",/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2022,cuzcatleco-36907,10," Early days but I'm loving it this far
","I know it's early but I can't stress enough how pleasantly surprised I am at how good this documentary is thus far. The tone of the documentary is set from the very beginning, you all may think that just because the football club is owned by individuals like Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mcelhenney that the documentary will have a silly tone, don't get me wrong it has it's silly moments but they're few and far between. The seriousness of the situation is really driven home by the documentary. I can't wait to see more!",/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2022,richardpowell-23908,10," Has all the ingredients needed to be a first class sports documentary!
",Two episodes in and I'm addicted! This has all ingredients needed to be a first-class sports documentary! You can really tell they have the town/city's best interest at heart and really want Wrexham to be more than a football club in the community! Also loving the Welsh language and highlighting Wrexham as a Welsh club! Da iawn!,/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2022,mignonette1,10," Never watched a football game, but this show is fantastic!
","As someone who doesn't watch any sports except mma, this show is top-notch and I am now a Wrexham fan! The show does such an amazing job of showing us the heart of this team, and the heart of Wrexham. I think anybody that watches this show will have a new-found appreciation for the sport, the players, and even the die-hard fans. You can't help but celebrate the wins and grieve the losses, right along with them. The show is just so good!",/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2022,reedychris,9," This show has real heart and the story makes you a club supporter
","Just finished episode 6 and enjoying this show more and more each week. The way they've been unfolding the story, sharing the history and the love from the community. To the touches of Ryan and Rob bringing in the Cinderella touch. Its just heart warming and beautiful. I love feel good sports movies, but this has something real about it that draws you in even more than the ""Remember the Titans"" or ""Coach Carter"" movies did.",/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,blondelobster17,10," Even if you don't like sports... you'll root for Wrexham!
","I came for Ryan and Rob. I stayed for the town, their love of their team and their undying support. A well made show with plenty of fun, touching moments regardless of your interest or knowledge of the game.",/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2022,Bgallo28,9," Randomly watched and what a show
",What a great show. I love how they integrated Rob. I didn't expect to get as emotionally involved as I thought I would. Definitely going to keep watching.,/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2022,jackspence-19896,10," I HATE FOOTBALL!
",But I freaking love this documentary.,/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,StantonDrew,8," Entertaining & heart-warming. A winner.
",As an Arsenal fan I've disliked Wrexham since 1992 when they had the temerity to knock us out of the FA Cup. So I went into this show with that long held antipathy towards the club.,/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2022,wellsywibblywobbly,10," True grit
","This is a rare show. Interesting, funny, moving, authentic and above all heartfelt. It may surprise people to know this is much less about Reynolds and McElhenney and more about a community, a forgotten part of the UK, local characters and a football (soccer) set-up that is immensely likeable (when compared with the grossed-out British Premier League). That is not to say that Ryan Reynolds' renowned wit doesn't pepper the series, but it's not the main course.",/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2022,milts-22133,9," Great little sports documentary
","Wasn't sure what to expect from this but really glad I gave it a go. Not just about the team but the whole community and how big a part the club plays in some/most peoples lives. Being a massive football fan it's great to see what these little clubs have to go through from player wages to pitches, behind scenes etc. Really eye opening, knew that there was a massive gulf between this level and the premier league but even to the football league it's staggering to see how big a deal it is to get into the main tiers of the football league. Even if you're not a football fan this is enjoyable just for the people. Would've been a 10 out of 10 but the only bad point is the poxy subtitles, they're a proper distraction and totally unnecessary.",/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,samanthagoodey,10," An emotional roller coaster
","I watch a lot of tv, I rarely leave reviews. I urge everyone to watch this, regardless of whether you like this sport or not. The way it highlights community, humanity, passion, drive and the unknown is phenomenal. Massive credit to Ryan and the other guy (joke!) who I don't think saw this as a money making scheme, they genuinely care about what they are trying to achieve and really put effort in on top of cash. You can see the emotional investment from everyone within this show. It's beautiful and perfectly summarises humans to me. Please give a couple of episodes a go, you will not regret it.",/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,jcpolm,10," Must watch for both sports fans and non-sports fans.
","One thing I love about this show is that it comes from the perspective of non-football fans. I never watched football (other than American football) but recently moved to Europe, and was always unable to connect with why it was the worlds most popular sport. This series makes it clear. I would recommend this series to anyone who doesn't appreciate sports, as it really puts a focus on why sports matter to people and to their communities.",/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,Stephanie4040,9," Brilliant
","This was an excellent series - really shows the working class heart of Britain, and our love of football no matter what the odds. Apart from loving the series, it is wonderful to see Ryan and Rob invest in Wrexham - the club deserves it. Really hoping that there are more documentary series to come - I want to watch them climb up the ladder and get into the higher leagues despite being a Liverpool fan. The locals they featured, the volunteer staff and the fans were spot on - with a good dose of humour thrown in. The only criticism is the filler episode that was done like a game show. I get they are trying to suck in American audiences, but man it was cringe. Still gonna watch this for as many seasons as they will produce. More please!",/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,FONYMAHONEY,8," I wanted to hate it, but it's already almost seminal.
","Wow. I mean, I was fearing what I think a lot of brits were with this show - the offensively unfunny Ted Lasso, in the real world.",/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2022,ozomatfan,7," I dislike reality TV, but love This !
","I'm fascinated with the idea of building some thing, and watch it grow into something amazing. Besides the fact that I find both Ryan and Rob hilarious, I thought let's see how this show goes. I've watched every single episode, and have to say this One of the first reality shows that is very humane. It has a level of emotion, humor, and rooting for the underdog that you wish all other reality shows could take a lesson from. I love learning about Wrexham, and its people. I also love learning about us as humans. It'll be interesting to see how they continue the show in the future. Thank you for doing this show.",/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2022,paul-allaer,7," Must-see for any football (a/k/a soccer) fan
","As Episode 1 of ""Welcome to Wrexham"" (2022 release; 9 episodes of which 8 are about 22 min each and episode 9 is 47 min) opens, we are introduced to ""Wrexham, Wales"", population 68,000, whose football team now plays in the 5th tier of English football. In other words: down and possibly out. We then learn that Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney (""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"") are interested in buying the team... At this point we are less than 10 minutes into Episode 1.",/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2022,mjb301086,8," Good
",Very good and very amusing. I think it's hilarious that they have to have subtitles for English parts when it's so clear lol Americans really must have difficulty understanding some of our accents but fair enough. Burton Albion got a mention too which is my second team so big ups for that lol. I love Ryan Reynolds and wish him and Rob all the best..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................,/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,timothy-price-794-581328,10," Love this....
","It is great to see the nuts and bolts of Football, and also a lower level club (sorry Wrexham) instead of the rich, glory clubs from the Premier League. And so many different aspects. The owners. The Fans. The management. The ground. The community. And most of all, the hope and heartbreak that is football. A warts and all documentary, the fans getting behind the club. The fans not behind the club when they aren't winning (football all over). Some so-called fans being absolute scum - again all teams have hooligan element. The best is SEEING all of this, the workings of the different fans minds. Some you want to hug. Some you want to slap. Overall though, the Wrexham community. And the additional fun of Rob and Ryan trying to get to grips with it, bringing some Hollywood gloss. And fun, because these guys are funny. And heartfelt. Hope and Agony. Love it.",/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2022,johnchurchward-02954,10," Story of undersdogs
","It is refreshing to see the tales from the position of an underdog in the English football leagues. Instead of having mega rich people having sports as a play thing this shows where yes some more money that normal is coming into a club but it is not endless with super talent wanting to join. You see where the influx of funds is helping such as getting the new pitch installed, many clubs in the lower tiers do not have the resources for the ground keeping. The conversations with locals are some much more grounded than you normally get to see. The players have a passion for the game without getting huge money and it is a struggle to attract players that will give the club the progress on the pitch. As soon as the next episode is available I have to watch.",/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,BroadSword66,8," Football: warts and all
","Welcome To Wrexham is a surprisingly gloss-free and honest look at the weird world of British football, an entity so embedded into the cultural fabric of the land that even if you don't like, watch or support a team it is still impossible to completely ignore.",/review/rw8607669/?ref_=tt_urv
