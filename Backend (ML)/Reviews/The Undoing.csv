","The first one was well made, but got boring. The second tried too hard to be cool. The third one was great, but the style was too jarring. The fourth one said: ""screw it, let's just have some fun"" and everyone else followed its lead.",/review/rw2527981/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2018,PWNYCNY,8," Excellent action movie.
","The movie presents a story that is absurd. Nevertheless, it is entertaining. The movie takes the players to many different parts of the world. How they get to these places the movie does not explain. At each place people are on the run, traps are being set, communications are tense, as the good guys and bad guys try to outwit the other. The movie is devoid of any overt political content, concentrating its attention on telling the story. Tom Cruise delivers an energetic performance that carries the movie. He is in almost every scene. The movie is never dull. For fans of action movies, this movie will not disappoint.",/review/rw2527981/?ref_=tt_urv

11 August 2015,charliep14,8," Mission Impossible at its best!
","The first half of the movie is probably the best action movie of the last 20 years. It is intense, well shot, engaging and absolutely stunning visually. The stunts and action set in Budapest, Moscow and Dubai and are absolutely fantastic and make the movie. Unfortunately the movie slows down greatly in the second half of the movie (or is it two thirds/one third?) in Mumbai and loses itself in some common genre traps: too much explaining stuff that doesn't make sense and some fairly 'average' action. It's a small gripe, probably half explained by the fantastic beginning of the movie. The cast is the best of the series: Jeremy Renner is a good addition, Lea Seydoux is a pretty cool villain and the female lead whose name escapes me is somebody I wish I would have seen in another movie? And Cruise is Cruise, he's the man in this saga. A great movie overall, well done Brad Bird!",/review/rw2527981/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2011,murtaza_mma,8," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The Action flick of the year, should you choose to watch it!
","The long wait is finally over as Tom Cruise finally returns to the celluloid to reprise his epic role of the enigmatic IMF agent Ethan Hunt. The brilliance of Mission: Impossible III was marred by the infamous sacking of Tom Cruise by Paramount's owner and movie mogul Sumner Redstone, who blamed Cruise's bizarre sofa-hopping TV antics, and intransigent support of Scientology for movie's relatively poor show at the box office that resulted in losses of up to £75million in revenue. The sordid incident ensured that the wait for the next installment of the franchise had to be a long one. The half a decade lull that ensued saw Cruise's career sunk to a new nadir with movies like Lions for Lambs (2007), Valkyrie (2008), and Knight and Day (2010) failing to impress at the box office, while his contemporaries and coevals continued to tumble records at the box office, attaining new heights of fame and stardom. It is indeed ironic that Cruise's most impressive show in this interim has been his well-disguised cameo in Ben Stiller's Tropic Thunder (2008) in which he plays a the foul-mouthed, hot-headed, half-bald studio executive. But, every coin has the other part that completes the picture. While the things have been going a bit rough on the professional front, Cruise's personal life has finally been witnessing a much needed sense of calmness and stability. Such stability on the personal front can often lift a person's morale providing him with a sense of rejuvenation that can help him fare well in all the facets of life. Tom Cruise's rejuvenated self is pretty much apparent in the latest installment of the MI franchise, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.",/review/rw2527981/?ref_=tt_urv

","Summer is usually the time for big loud action-packed blockbusters like this, but let us tell you right at the start that none of the bombast we've seen this summer compares to what lies in store for you in the fourth big-screen adaptation of the 1970s television series. This is hands-down the best action film this year, boasting some of the most exhilarating action ever captured in a long while. It also restores Tom Cruise's marquee value as an action star, and we dare attest that any naysayer to Cruise's ability to resurrect the franchise he almost drowned will be silenced once they see what he does on screen.",/review/rw2527981/?ref_=tt_urv

11 May 2015,troyputland,8," Crazy, Good Fun
","Mission: Impossible IV, also known as Ghost Protocol, holds many variations from its forebears. First, is its name. It's edgy, unique and stands out from the previous three. Second, is Ethan's (Cruise) new team. A strong cast backs Cruise. Pegg is a massive breath of fresh air with his light, off-handed humour. He's been upgraded from desk boy to field agent. Patton is the new kick-ass beauty and Renner adds muscle that's not particularly needed because Cruise has all other areas covered. The story is unsurprisingly straight forward; Ethan and co. have a new villain (Nyqvist) to take down who's crippled the IMF (Impossible Mission Force). Nyqvist has been scripted with a bland, lifeless persona. He only shows quality of any worth the moment his life ends. Just one negative point amongst a trifle of goods. Tom is as daring as ever, toppling his stunts in II and III with one that will leave you with clenched butt-cheeks and sweaty palms. The gadgets are incredible and the set-pieces are superb. One in Dubai flowing smoothly into another taking place in a dust storm. Cruise and director Brad Bird have achieved the right level of action and emotion with this MI outing. Let's hope they stick with this formula in future films.",/review/rw2527981/?ref_=tt_urv

","There is no Tom in team and Tom Cruise finally learned that as demonstrated in the best Mission Impossible yet! Tom is getting a little bit older so it was a good question if he still had it in him to be a great action star since his career is still a little shaky over the past few years, he's proved once again that he's almost ageless. Despite the fact that it's the unrealistic action, in my opinion that's the best kind! I love my Tom Cruise running without losing an ounce of breath, I love throwing every element of surprise at the team and they manage to get around it, I love the explosions not effecting anyone, the car chases, the dust storms, it's just amazing! Mission Impossible 4 is a roller coaster ride of excitement and doesn't let you go.",/review/rw2527981/?ref_=tt_urv

","As wonderful as ever. As a casual commercial film that doesn't require too much brains, Mission Impossible 4 is as big a scene and stimulating special effects as ever. Although Atango's acting skills have not improved for so many years, Atango's handsome face has not changed.

1 February 2021,Doublej20005,8," A Great Action Film
","This is the best one so far. The action and stunts are once again taken to a whole new level, with the Burj Khalifa sequence being the obvious but not only standout, and the supporting cast are the best its ever been, with Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton all bringing something new to the team whilst never really taking the attention off of the central plot. The plot is decent, the score is really good and Brad Bird brings his own distinctive flair to the franchise. That's a main part of what I love about this franchise - the amount of different directors that have brought their own style to the franchise makes it always feel fresh and different from its predecessors. I have two small complaints, the first being that the villain, whilst menacing, isn't really as good as Phillip Seymour Hoffman in the last film. Secondly, with the best set piece being the Burj Khalifa climb by far, it does make the final action sequence not as impressive given what came before. Overall, though, this is just a great action film, and one I'd definitely recommend.",/review/rw2527981/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise as a person and that sometimes influences my opinion on a film. Even with this point in the back of my mind I must say that Tom Cruise still got it. He's a fantastic actor who doesn't even chose to have a stunt double in MI4. I couldn't even think of trying some of these. Now to the main film. You may think it's going to be just like all the other action movies and all the other Mission: Impossible parts. But with every new part of the series it gets even more spectacular: the equipment is beyond imagination, the locations are mind blowing, the secret plans are super clever, the characters are cool and smart. Also the trailer was that good that I just wanted to see this at the movies and couldn't wait for it to be released. I haven't seen any MI film at the movies and this was definitely a great decision.
