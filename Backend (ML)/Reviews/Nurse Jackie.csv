16 February 2020,RobinFlys,5," Unbelievingly cringy!
","What the heck is this? After five frivolous conversations they are in love? I guess if you throw several attractive, emotionally immature people together, someone's bound to ""fall in love"". The girls have no indoor voice, only over-the-top staged, loud conversations. The word ""like"" is used twice in every sentence, sometimes more. All of the guys cry. It's the first time any of them have ever felt *fill in emotion here*. I think I vomited at one point.",/review/rw5491774/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2020,wildestdxeams,1," Is love blind?
","Producers: *we wanna do a 'scientific experiment' that is supposed to show whether love is based on outward appearance*

",What type of dim wit really thinks you can make a lifetime commitment and decision in just a matter of days? Well that's what the show is full of so we get lots of interviews with these idiots saying things they think are deep. But in spite of this I've watched 3 episodes of this junk and I don't feel good about it.,/review/rw5491774/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2020,ghees-24837,8," Better than the Bachelor
",Of course it's stupid - cringeworthy at times. But it's a better concept. It's so entertaining. I mean what's worse than 1 guy/girl to 20+ girls/guys? nothing. This is better. I can't stop watching.,/review/rw5491774/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2020,teagwo,7," The show you love to hate
","It's shallow, corny, unrealistic and you will love to waste some hours watching this fools trying really hard to be in love with someone they don't know about. Great guilty please TV show.",/review/rw5491774/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2020,mhunts33,2," Rediculous
","Ok...People are either acting or completely insane. One guy is actually crying after telling a woman, in the 3rd conversation they have ever had mind you... that he loves her?!? I can understand the experiment they are in but its just not believable . More staged ""reality "". However in this day and age it will probably be on tv for the next 20 years like the Bachelor or Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire.",/review/rw5491774/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2020,dresmiles,2," Only 2 reason to watch this

24 February 2020,cinemagick,," One of the dumbest shows I've seen in a while
","Naive 20-somethings ask each other questions sight unseen. No one is realistic in their answers, obviously saying whatever they think is the best sounding response to vapid, general questions. Think The Bachelor mixed with Dating Game. It actually makes me nauseous watching such meaningless programming starring obviously fame/attention seeking contestants. Hosted by some boy band guy that adds nothing whatsoever.",/review/rw5491774/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2020,chrissm38,6," Dumb but entertaining
","Of course love isn't blind, but it's nice to laugh at idiots who think it could be.",/review/rw5491774/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2020,AlsExGal,1," The bland leading the bland
","It's too bad all of these young people want to be involved romantically based on something that is not their looks, because that seems to be all they have going for themselves. I think the producers of this show know that marrying someone in 30 days based on a series of speed dating like questions and 15 minutes of fame mixed with ample alcohol is a bad idea, and yet these young folk don't. And given the current times, the locale of the show looks like a good place to pick up coronavirus. I would avoid. Maybe not as bad as those Fox reality shows around the turn of the century, but when you are comparing bad to awful, what does it really matter?",/review/rw5491774/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2020,dvs8866-1,2," This is where the next generation deserves
","Good lord. Thank you for the rainy day I needed to recharge and reevaluate my life choices and know beyond a shadow of a doubt I'd rather be alone with my cactus than to make a life long commitment to a stranger. These vapid people think they're in love with someone they've never seen, haven't spent actual time outside their ""love bubble pod"". The Ex tank mechanic is one of the most obnoxious humans and has made my eyeballs roll so far back into my head, they were stuck for a full three minutes. Probably as long as this Lethario, Barnett, would last in bed.
Where the heck are the Lachey's and why are they receiving hosting credits when I'm well into the third episode and haven't seen them since the first?
If there was full dont all, I would've given it 4 stars.",/review/rw5491774/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2020,keikoyoshikawa,1," Fake
",Attractive people. Too bad they're all shallow. Watch it if you want to see gorgeous men and women pretending to have deep thoughts and genuine emotions. I'm quite sure many of the people are acting or else their reactions are contrived for the camera.,/review/rw5491774/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2020,karaq,1," This is why fast forward was created!!
","Boring, pathetic and so cringeworthy! I made it through 1/2 of episode one. Skipped to last episode to see if people would actually marry someone they proposed to after 5 conversations behind a wall and guess what, spoiler alert, people ARE that dumb!! I only used skip 10 seconds 20 times that episode! I am so glad I didn't waste time or brain cells on episodes 2 through 9!!",/review/rw5491774/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2022,ymousnona123,3," Downhill since Season 1
","Season 1 was amazing. It had the right amount of drama and some really interesting people/ couples. There were some genuine people on this show, and I loved seeing the friendships between the cast members. Of course, there's a villain of the season, but she just laid low and then apologized for what happened.",/review/rw5491774/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2020,Debette-1,4," I wish these folks had a clue...
","It would be far more interesting to do this with a group of *mature* people (and I don't mean old) who actually know what love is about, and know what makes a marriage work. I'm halfway through the second episode, and while I've seen the trailers that show difficult times ahead, it wasn't hard to see that coming because thinking you're 'in love' after a few days - well, there's a whole lot more to love than what this group understands.",/review/rw5491774/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2020,davidm-14,7," offshoot of ""married at first sight""

27 February 2020,duckonthedam,8," A Good Binge Watch
","I'm kind of embarrassed to say I loved this. I think I wanted to cry a little though in the last episode. Some true shocks. I think the experience would have been better if they'd allowed at least 4-6 months before the weddings. Just too rushed, and overwhelming for the participants. I hope they're all doing okay now.",/review/rw5491774/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2020,Toph72,2," Shallow Waste of Time
","This show is the shallowest I've ever seen. The men are all good looking and fit; the women are all fit and beautiful. Let's have some real falling in love with the personality by having ""real people"" and not pseudo-models.",/review/rw5491774/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2020,ddt21977,3," Love is blind but Netflix viewers aren't.
","Big surprise...everyone is a very attractive person just searching for their soulmate. It's eyerolling that the concept is based on meeting, loving, and marrying someone based on personality yet physicality is what determines whether or not they will put you on camera. This concept and content is nothing any of us haven't seen before. Two strangers meet and within days start lying about how much they have fallen in love, they've never felt this way before, nobody has made them feel this way before , and blah, blah, blah. The show is unoriginal, bland, and I guarantee there are better options on Netflix than this. Ruling: SKIP IT.",/review/rw5491774/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2020,lewys_hughes,3," Talk about lack of diversity
","This show is such a wired concept to start with and kinda entertains how stupid it is. But how can they call it Love is blind when all of them look as if they are models, and yes that is subject to opinion",/review/rw5491774/?ref_=tt_urv
