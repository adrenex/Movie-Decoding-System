1 October 2021,dromasca,9," a remarkable one shot take 'chef' movie
","'Boiling Point', the second film by English director Philip Barantini will be, I think, one of the sensations of the cinematographic year 2021. It has been presented so far in only a few festivals and will meet with the broader public in cinema halls starting in October. There are in this film, bold in form and sensitive in content, the premises of a love story with the audiences.",/review/rw7801505/?ref_=tt_urv

","Firstly, Stephen Graham is one of the most underrated actors from all time. He is always brilliant, credible, raw, and intense on his job. Here too. He does again an acting masterclass.",/review/rw7801505/?ref_=tt_urv

","Why is the world not talking more about this? What a fantastic film. Sometimes reminded me of Mass (raw acting as credible as if we were seeing real people). Sometimes reminded me of Uncut Gems and Shiva Baby (anxiety inducing, small spaces, chaos, dealing with stupid people, screaming inside).",/review/rw7801505/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2022,cathyannemoore-66196,10," Has a documentary 'fly on the wall' feel
","Anything with Stephen Graham in it is going to be good. This is so well acted and cast, one has to keep reminding oneself it's a movie not a documentary. Graham was outstanding in his performance and Vinette Robinson deserved her BAFTA she was so convincing in her role. As well as acting they all seemed to know what they were doing in the kitchen. My only niggle, and no one else seems to have struggled with this, is that I couldn't quite catch all of the dialogue.",/review/rw7801505/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2021,SnoopyStyle,8," single shot
",It's a hectic night in a London restaurant. Head chef Andy Jones (Stephen Graham) has been under stressed and failing to maintain standards for the last two months. The health inspector downgrades their rating due to his bad paperwork. His mentor is coming with a food critic. There is conflicts in and out of the kitchen. It is chaotic poetry.,/review/rw7801505/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2022,lareval,9," A riveting night
","On a stylish level, this is an absolute stunning experience. To be presented in tracking shot (unbroken and without tricks) sends adrenaline rushes to the brain and it helps to get the right, nerve-wracking tone with the performances.",/review/rw7801505/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2022,michael-kerrigan-526-124974,8," Remarkable achievement
","Breathtakingly shot in a single take and set entirely within a restaurant, Boiling Point captures the stresses and strains of working in this environment. Stephen Graham leads a brilliant ensemble cast all improvising a skeleton script. Who would have thought a seemingly normal night in a restaurant could provide such drama and tension. A must see 8.5 out of ten. A Q&A with some of the cast, the director and the brilliant director of photography was a nice bonus. They were meant to shoot it 8 times and choose the best of the 8. However, they were filming in March 2020 and they were shut down after the four takes for obvious reasons. A brilliant achievement.",/review/rw7801505/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2021,eddie_baggins,8," A tension riddled restaurant thriller
","You wouldn't think a film set in a kitchen over one fateful night would be the stuff of white knuckle tension but in adapting their short film of the same name for a feature length affair, director Philip Barantini and his star Stephen Graham have crafted one of 2021's most sweat inducing rides that is a technical accomplishment as well as a storytelling one, that is sure to make you reevaluate the life of busy kitchen/restaurant.",/review/rw7801505/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wow. What can you say about this movie? It feels so genuine. The tension is brutal. This is a MasterClass in acting, directing, camera work, and writing. The choreography of movement is truly hard to comprehend. The dedication of cast and crew, to a person, cannot be overstated. It is simply a work of art.",/review/rw7801505/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2022,pforrest-2,10," Stunning one-shot movie with superb acting.
","I was blown away by this wonderful movie. The naturalistic acting and dialogue were fantastic. I usually love Stephen Graham in every role, even (often!) unsympathetic ones. He was fantastic, but maybe even eclipsed by a magnificent performance by his assistant chef, played by Vinette Robinson. The entire cast were excellent. And although the basic feeling you walk away with is that it takes a special kind of person to work under this sort of pressure night after night - rather them than me - there are moments of lightness and empathy too. The technical challenges of the one-shot movie were handled superbly. Totally worthy of a raft of Oscars.",/review/rw7801505/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2022,mavis_gary_mavis,8," Serving Up A Single Shot Of Excellence
","This is a compelling single shot drama set on a busy night in a high-end restaurant. The ""oner"" never feels like a gimmick here - especially as it was done for real and not stitched together (according to IMDB trivia the filmmakers used take 3 of 4) - making the continuous shot an immersive experience. Although the plot is relatively low-key, the performances are fantastic and real, led by the always watchable Stephen Graham. This is a great slice of life, funny and sad, and if nothing else a nice reminder: hell might be other people, but there's none worse than a customer acting like a jerk.",/review/rw7801505/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2022,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," Chef knives out.
","'Boiling Point (2021)' must have been as stressful for its filmmakers to make as its events are for its characters to experience. This 90-minute feature is presented as one continuous shot and it actually is, avoiding the usual hidden cuts that come with this sort of thing. That instantly makes it an incredibly impressive affair, one that indisputably features a lot of genuine talent both in front of and behind the camera (as well as a helping of luck). Its one-take nature isn't just a gimmick, though; it actively contributes to the flick's increasingly claustrophobic feel and constantly 'slice of life' aesthetic. It almost feels like an observational documentary, which enhances the impact of its social realist drama. It expertly balances a whole restaurant's worth of characters, weaving a dozen stories together into a tactile tapestry depicting just another busy night in a high-class London eatery. The actors all do remarkably well, not only remaining in character but also delivering strong performances (and surely improvising their way through a few flubbed lines). The camera operator manages to keep up with the amazingly detailed choreography. It's rather play-like in nature and could easily work on stage, but that enhances the narrative rather than distract from it (sometimes, play-like pieces can seem too 'talky' for film). For the most part, it maintains a balance between realism and drama, delivering an experience that almost always feels true to life. Of course, it slightly exaggerates certain aspects, but it only does so in order to ratchet up the tension and explore some devastating reveals. A couple of these exaggerated elements do take away from the believability of the story, reminding you that you're actually watching a film, but this is likely only because the rest of the picture is so grounded and compelling. In particular, there are a couple of monologues that feel distinctly like movie moments, and the ending itself actually undercuts much of the story's other successes (it kind of feels like a cop out). These problems don't ruin the piece, though. Technically, it's nothing short of a triumph. It's also constantly enjoyable in its own way, keeping you invested in its various characters and as close to the edge of your seat as possible. It's a palpable and propulsive piece that impresses, entertains and doesn't even come close to overstaying its welcome.",/review/rw7801505/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2022,adrianmorar-19708,9," Exceptional
",I remain amazed to the fact that all these actors could remain in character for the whole runtime of the film and still make me feel as if these people truly work in that environment. It keeps you engaged and in tension while the camera seamlessly moves across the whole restaurant without taking you out of the story for one second.,/review/rw7801505/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2021,andrewbunney,9," One night, one restaurant, one chef, one shot; one relentless nightmare
","Set in and around a restaurant during a single evening, we are following a London chef struggling to keep it together. He has problems in his family life, he owes money, and he hasn't been keeping up with the paperwork at his chic, upmarket restaurant. On the evening we meet him, the restaurant has been over-booked and understaffed, none of which the maitre de wants to accept responsibility for. And the health inspector has just arrived to go over the kitchen very thoroughly, and he quickly finds plenty of room for improvements. The chef is doing his best in the very difficult circumstances. It's Fawlty Towers without the laughs, just the relentless, grinding, pathetically-human tragedy; every cook's nightmare.",/review/rw7801505/?ref_=tt_urv

I can't think of anything more essential in filmmaking, and anything harder. Low budget or high. Brilliant, brilliant movie.",/review/rw7801505/?ref_=tt_urv
