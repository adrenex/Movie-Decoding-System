29 October 2021,TxMike,," Mostly true story of 12 orphans forming a winning football team.
","This is a mostly true, historically based story. Ft Worth Texas, late 1930s, families still suffering from the Great Depression, some were orphaned because of that. A new teacher and coach shows up, former athlete and WW1 hero, decides that playing high school football will help the boys cope with their somewhat hopeless situations. It seems that none of them knew how to play.",/review/rw7364935/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2021,zardoz-13,9," Truly, An Inspirational Gridiron Tale
","Feel-good movies are like death and taxes. You cannot elude them. These predictable but sentimental sagas tap into our DNA and generate a devastating sense of euphoria that can melt the hearts of even the most ascetic souls. Often prefaced by the phrase ""inspired by true events,"" these exercises in Pavlovian button-pushing have created one of the most synthetic film genres that shamelessly exploit our lowest common denominator mindset. You're supposed to experience the same universal reaction as everybody or you risk of being mocked as a curmudgeon. Chiefly, an earnest cast and an aura of rugged authenticity make ""12 Mighty Orphans"" into a thoroughly entertaining epic. Watching this Depression-era drama unfold, you'll sympathize with our vulnerable protagonists who face multiple setbacks both on and off the gridiron. Happily, most of the history is accurate. Naturally, Hollywood cannot resist fudging with the facts, though sometimes you have to admire their sense of sophistry. For example, Coach Russell reveals that he grew up an orphan, too. Clearly, the filmmakers have altered the truth. Nevertheless, you cannot imagine the impact such a revelation must have had on these struggling lads. They felt closer to him because he had triumphed over adversity. Actually, Coach Russell wasn't an orphan, but taking liberties like this white lie are the bread and butter of most feel-good films. Writer & director Ty Roberts and co-scenarists Lane Garrison of ""Spy Intervention"" and Kevin Meyer of ""Across Five Aprils"" have adapted sports writer Jim Dent's acclaimed 2008 book ""Twelve Mighty Orphans: The Inspiring True Story of the Mighty Mites Who Ruled Texas Football."" Similarly, earlier in 2000, Dent had written about another influential football coach in ""The Junction Boys: How Ten Days in Hell with Bear Bryant Forged A Championship Team."" Between the 1980s and 1990s, Dent covered the Dallas Cowboys extensively for eleven years in two newspapers: The Dallas Times Herald and later The Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Few know America's most popular sport inside and out like Dent.",/review/rw7364935/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2021,deloudelouvain,7," Entertaining even for non football fans.
","12 Mighty Orphans is inspired by true events. I don't know if it was accurate or not but the movie is certainly entertaining and enjoyable to watch. You don't necessarily have to be a football (American Football that is) fan to appreciate this movie, although it helps. The cast was well chosen, they all did a good job playing their characters. It's an inspiring story that will touch a fair part of the audience. Not a bad movie on this subject.",/review/rw7364935/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2021,blanbrn,7," Sentimental real life tale of coming together with teamwork and becoming family!
","""12 Mighty Orphans"" is one heartfelt feel good stand up and cheer like film as it looks at the life and times of a dozen Orphans in Texas during the 1930's and the great depression era. Set near Forth Wort, Texas an academy and school for the poor and forgotten has opened up and coming in is the start of a football team. Rusty Russell(Luke Wilson) and his teacher wife have came with open arms as he's a coach with a winning resume, and he gets the praise from the school's doctor Doc Hall(the good veteran Martin Sheen). Along the way as the boys enter no matter how troubled or different they bond and learn plenty about life, love, sharing, teamwork, and commitment. Though tough and rocky at first these boys learn the basic fundamentals of blocking and tackling and after some and a few loses the speed and hard work starts to pay off and wins start to follow one by one all the way up to the Texas state championship game! Well done film of how faith and hard work and determination can change life, really a fine film to few with friends or family as when watching all will feel the values of bonding and working together.",/review/rw7364935/?ref_=tt_urv

14 September 2021,nogodnomasters,8," It is tough to believe
","Inspired by a true story. In 1938 Ft. Worth, Texas, the Masonic lodge ran an orphanage. Rusty Russell (Luke Wilson) was brought in to coach a football team that didn't exist and had to fight to get into a league. Because he had a smaller team, he had to create a spread offense and develop a passing game in the age of the run.",/review/rw7364935/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2022,planktonrules,7," A true story...with some liberal doses of 'Hollywoodizing'.
","The story in ""12 Mighty Orphans"" is true....or at least mostly true. But like so many other films based on true stories, huge liberties were taken here and there to make the story more cinematic. So, while it is true that the orphans' home did field a team with only 12 players and they EVENTUALLY were champion calliber, much of the timeline has been condensed and things 'adjusted' (Franklin Roosevelt never had any involvement in the story and there was no evil rival coach).",/review/rw7364935/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2021,Blumanowar,9," What a great football movie! I loved it!
","For all of us old football players we remember what it was like in the 60's, 70's and 80,s playing small town football with all of us country boys spanking up on the city boys. Man that was fun, that's America man. But these tough boys played before we had nice helmets and pads and played with steel spikes in their shoes. I remember my grandfathers story I heard a hundred times how his liver was perforated with those steel spikes. Footballs a damn tough game, unless you've played you simply don't know how rough it was and you just have no idea how the game is played. But these boys had it really tough with that old equipment.",/review/rw7364935/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2021,kenzibit,8," Has one of the best inspirational speeches in history by Hardy Brown.
","This is a feel good movie, a movie that ups your spirit and inspires you never to give up in tough and dejected times. This is probably a story that most people haven't heard of and the fact that it brought hope to a nation during the great depression.... I'm very glad it's now on big screen. Great direction of wonderful characters most of which I've never seen and I really admired their performances in this movie. This is a must watch movie to appreciate where most of the things we know or teach originated from.... not forgetting this movie has one of the best inspirational quotes told in a story.",/review/rw7364935/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2021,gchardman,8," Taking Liberties With The Timeline
","Those looking for an entertaining movie will find that in ""12 Mighty Orphans"", but only if you accept the liberties taken with the timeline. The movie portrays Rusty Russell arriving at the Masonic Home in 1938, putting together a football team and leading to an apperance in the state championship that season. In reality Coach Russell arrived at the Masonic Home in 1926. He built the program into a quality outfit that reached the state championship game against Corsicana in 1932. That game ended in a scoreless draw with the state title awarded to Corsicana in the tie breaking system of penetrations inside the opponents 20 yard line. My guess is producers opted to take liberties with the timeline in order to insert President Franklin Delano Roosevelt into the story. In reality Coach Russell and his Mighty Mites made their only state championship apperance before FDR took over the White House. The movie is well worth watching. Stay seated to read the closing credits that complete the story. Then go back and research the rest of the story about the Masonic Home and the extraordinary circumstances of those young men and women who called the place their home.",/review/rw7364935/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2021,MHeying777-1,9," A New Film Genre--The True American Orphan
","My orphan wife and I found ""12"" very satisfying and highly emotional, given we are both orphans. (I spent 9 years at the Tarrant County Children's Home, cross town rivals of the Masonics in '58 when we beat them for the industrial league state basketball championship. Two of the ""12 Mighty Mites"", Charles Sealey and Jack Whitley, became my football coaches at Poly High in '61. Whitley flew a B-25 in WWII and Sealey was a paratrooper. Whitley also became superintendent of the Tarrant County Children's Home prior to my time there. My mother--Poly class of '38--likely attended the games with Poly depicted in the film.) This film has some great acting and a good script, although it seems a bit fast paced. I didn't want it to end.",/review/rw7364935/?ref_=tt_urv
