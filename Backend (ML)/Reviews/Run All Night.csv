15 December 2022,dani_fz,9," It boggles my mind how this beautiful series is still woefully under-watched
","I just finished watching this series and I'm struck by how underrated it seems to be. I mean, considering how entertaining it is and the strong positive social commentaries that it makes coupled with its decent visual appeal, one cannot help but wonder how so many people seem to not yet have watched it.",/review/rw8723769/?ref_=tt_urv

",This is a haunting tale. It will stay with you long after you have finished the last episode. There are so many quotable moments and some truly masterful performances. A highly recommended watch!,/review/rw8723769/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2022,SverigeismyHjarta,5," I am a black woman and I was not that fond of it
","The sets and costumes were good I will say. But I did not like the actress playing Frannie. Maybe it was correct in line with the book, I do not know as I have not read the book. But from the start she was not likeable! Very holier than thou and did not get my desire to help her. She even was not trying to let friends, the lawyer help her when they tried. The mistress was spoiled and selfish in my view and I am not surprised was not going to have a lesbian relationship, mixed child etc with her. But I do not blame her as this is something only an option to women in the very very recent years.",/review/rw8723769/?ref_=tt_urv
