10 November 2018,Tweekums,9," It may be puerile and crude but it is also utterly hilarious
",This crude comedy series is centred on Richie Richard and Edward Hitler; a couple of unemployed losers living in Hammersmith. Over the course of eighteen episodes they get into a number of situations where things inevitably turn out for the worse or their feeble plans fail miserably. Their frequent arguments inevitably end up with violence.,/review/rw6191386/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2000,action-6,," Excellent British humour
","Bottom is one of my favorite tv-series.  It is a really funny show with over-the-top-violence and starring two men who just refuse to accept what they really are: losers.  There is plenty of needless violence, weird-situations and laughable special-effects which makes Bottom a real cult-series.  This series rocks and everyone who`d enjoy a different comedy-series should buy the series on video or catch the re-runs on tv. Magnificent!",/review/rw6191386/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2003,tonygillan,," Crude, dirty, juvenile slapstick. Hurrah!
","'Bottom' is one of those programmes whereby you know what it will be like before you watch it. If you like crude, dirty, juvenile slapstick then watch and enjoy. If you don't, then don't.",/review/rw6191386/?ref_=tt_urv

31 May 2002,SkippyDevereaux,," One of the best comedy series ever!!
","This is one of the funniest programs ever. The humor may be low-brow, but it is still great!! Every episode was a classic!! Another winner from Great Britain!! I loved the episodes about getting stuck on top of the ferris wheel after closing time, trying to tap into a neighbor's gas line illegally, and the one where Eddie was dressed as a woman in the hotel. Like I said, it is a funny show!!",/review/rw6191386/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2015,paul_haakonsen,7," Mad British humor...
","First of all, it should be said that you have to enjoy the unique and dark satire of British comedy in order to appreciate ""Bottom"". I do, and I found the ""Bottom"" series to be quite hilarious.",/review/rw6191386/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2006,ShadeGrenade,10," An Everyday Story Of Two Men And A Frying Pan
","It seemed strange that, after the witty satirical farce 'The New Statesman', Rik Mayall should choose to return to the ultra-crude, knockabout comedy of 'The Young Ones'. He and Adrian Edmondson starred as 'Richie Richard' and 'Eddie Hitler', two natural-born losers who when not railing against the world are at each other's throats. The show's violence is pitched at the level of 'The Three Stooges'. It was at its funniest when the characters were in isolation; in their disgusting flat, trapped on a fun-fair ferris wheel, or watching cricket whilst sunbathing on the roof of a shop. Here they could work off their aggression verbally. Steven O'Donnell and Christopher Ryan were hilarious as Richie and Eddie's deranged friends 'Spudgun' and 'Dave Hedgehog'. Mayall and Edmondson were right to limit 'Richie' and 'Eddie' to two seasons, but made a terrible mistake in bringing them to the big screen; the result was the frightful and best forgotten 'Guest House Paradiso'.",/review/rw6191386/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2001,Jonathan Horner,," Funniest show on earth

2 August 2007,Howlin Wolf,7," They can't go any lower...
","""Bottom"" is another entry in the series of Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson projects that involve these grown men behaving like children and hitting one another. What's wrong with juvenile slapstick violence? Absolutely nothing. With these guys you have a good idea what you're going to get, and they give it to you (Ooo-er!)",/review/rw6191386/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 1999,Kryten-11,," Greatest physical pervy humour there ever was
","Bottom. Comedy masterpiece. From the opening episode 'Smells', to the most recent live tour 'Hooligan's Island', Bottom has succeeded in making anyone who is into fart gags and frying pan bashed gasmen, laugh uncontrollably.",/review/rw6191386/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2002,Mmyers2003,," Rik Mayall and Ade Edmundson rule the world of comedy
","Bottom is brilliant and is a unique sitcom in that it deals with violents which was rarely seen in any other show except the Young Ones and Filthy, Rich and Cat Flap which both also included Rik and Ade. I've done transcripts on some of the other comedies on here before but this bit needs to be told to all who read this (involves R and E deciding what game to play):",/review/rw6191386/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2009,missstephie,10," ""Foxy Stoat Seeks Pig!"" (Classic daftness if ever I saw it.)
","Now this is definitely what I would call a ""work of art"". 'Bottom' is a broad collision of highly indecent behaviour, artistic expression, excellent scripting and wonderful acting. Written by and also starring Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson, it was first broadcast in 1991 to what I imagine would have been a very shocked but enlightened audience.",/review/rw6191386/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2020,bgsmall,9," Richie... Eddie - there is my youth right there
","'Bottom' was I think (?) the third outing for the Mayall - Edmondson Richie - Eddie double act respectively. The previous vehicles being the Young ones and Filthy, Rich and Catflap (both also great!). I grew up on alternative 80's comedy and by the time the duo got to 'Bottom' (i.e. in the 90's) they both knew what the audience wanted. Principally, lots of smutty innuendo and slapstick humour to accompany the pairs attempts to raise themselves from the grime and poverty of their bare existence.",/review/rw6191386/?ref_=tt_urv

13 July 2019,gibbs-18172,8," Bottoms come out tops
","The late great Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson in this surreal , adult rated slapstick comedy. Its a 2019 review but this was a staple of my last few years of school life and where i was maybe a little young when The Young Ones hit BBC i was a great age for this . However 30 years later its still funny because of the visuals. Yes some of the verbal loses context thats time but its just that one of a type comedy never been done since.",/review/rw6191386/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2001,Rendernahk,," Pure brilliance
",This truly is one of the best comedies I have ever seen most of it had me in tears especially the live shows. It is amazing how they made two guys living in a run down flat so amusing showing the wacky ideas and very over the top fighting brought a tear to my eye many a time!!,/review/rw6191386/?ref_=tt_urv

22 August 2021,deloudelouvain,8," Better than The Young Ones.
","Bottom is like The Young Ones a show I did enjoy a lot when I was young. Bottom is slightly better though. It's still silly provocative humor with Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson. Maybe not the sort of humor everybody will enjoy but if you like overexaggerated humor with some sexist passages you can't go wrong with Bottom. Rik Mayall is the absolute star in this comedy. His facial expressions, his body language, it's just hilarious. Adrian Edmondson is not bad at all but Rik Mayall is just stealing the show. It's one of those shows I can watch over and over again, the kind you know by heart at one point.",/review/rw6191386/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2014,Rabical-91,10," ''What a charming smashing blouse you're wearing!''
","When Rik Mayall died a couple of months ago, the BBC, by way of a tribute, repeated both 'The Young Ones' and 'Bottom', while ITV gave us reruns of 'The New Statesman' and 'Rik Mayall Presents'. As I was snowed under with work obligations at the time, I did not get to see the reruns but managed when I had some spare time to watch some of the late star's stuff on DVD. Having recently been re-watching episodes of 'Bottom', I was reminded how wonderful a comedy actor Rik Mayall really was. One of his greatest assets was his rubber-like face which through a plethora of hilarious expressions could go from being strikingly handsome to hideously ugly within a matter of seconds.",/review/rw6191386/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2014,Just-Being-Me,10," One word... BRILLIANT
","This comedy never gets old, it never fails to make me laugh, it is one of the only comedy shows that actually makes me LOL (laugh out loud). It is just amazing and always cheers me up. It makes me laugh just thinking of the things that happen in the show. I think these two are the perfect comedy duo. Yes it is rude, yes there is a lot of sex talk/jokes, there is violence but it is very funny.",/review/rw6191386/?ref_=tt_urv

23 October 2016,briandecarrun,9," Anything goes humour
","Brilliant and anarchic humour and can be watched time and time again - real cartoon style sitcom with a touch of the outrageous. While it may not be to everyone's taste, but if you like this sort of humour, well then this is of the highest quality with all the madness that the two lads always bring to their roles. Great series, and their spin off film likewise was completely madcap in every way with laughs all the way through. The Tom and Jerry style cartoon violence to each other is so well done when they get going hitting each other and all done in terms of a stage setting so some credit to the the sets. Two lads are were a great comedy partnership and one well missed......",/review/rw6191386/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2020,FilmBlokeJ,10," One of the Funniest Sitcoms Ever Made
","This is one of the funniest shows ever made in my opinion, you may disagree but to me it is a masterpiece. It's low brow and stupid but it's a prime example of how to do sex and toilet humour correctly. Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson are one of my favourite double acts and this is an example of them mastering there trade. The characters of Richie and Eddie are brilliant as two flatmates in a s***y flat looking for birds and alcohol (and beating the c**p out of each other). This formula has been done before in sitcom such as Steptoe and Son, Porridge and Red Dwarf but this is by far the best (although Red Dwarf comes very close). These are characters we enjoy watching and detesting but let's face it, on the inside we all have a little Richie or a Eddie but we won't let them out for moral, ethical and legal reasons. This comedy show is about as deep as a puddle in terms of it's themes and targets for satire unlike other brilliant comedies such as The Young Ones, The New Statesman and South Park, but it's not intended to be deep, it's suppose to be something to watch (preferably after a long drinking binge and some curries) and get a good laugh out of. Every episode had me laughing out loud and they all have great writing and rewatch value (I can watch it 100s of times and never get board of it), even plots that seem dull on paper like being stuck up a ferris wheel or trying to kill time without the telly, in execution they are as funny as hell (I will still keep quoting it until the day I die). Overall a brilliant comedy that's not for everyone but if you have a demented sense of humour like me than, yeah give it a go.",/review/rw6191386/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2020,Ruskington,7," Two funny men, being funny
","While I don't think the writing is quite as sharp as certain other classic British comedies, Bottom allows a particular indulgence into stomach-wrenching vulgarity thanks to the almost cartoonesque brilliance of Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson.",/review/rw6191386/?ref_=tt_urv
