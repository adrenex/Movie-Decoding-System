14 June 2019,dogma-53668,8," Old fashioned murder mystery on a ship.
",A nice easy breezy murder mystery. Full of fun. Don't count on anything serious or deep here just sit back with your popcorn and a soda and enjoy the movie. Nothing offencive here. Just an adult murder mystery romp. We don't get many like these anymore. Ignore the people who like to criticize everything because they think they are actual critics. Chemistry between Aniston and Sadler is awesome. I hope they make more movies together.,/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2019,PsychoBeard666,8," I expected to hate this
",Decent plot. Good performances. Jokes that land. Adam Sandler doesn't scream or shout once. Everything works. Very understated.,/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2019,barngoddess4,8," Good movie
",I found this movie very enjoyable it has an Agatha Christie vibe to it Adam sandler and Jennifer aniston have great chemistry it's worth a watch,/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2019,TheWalkingDood,8," We need more Sandler & Aniston.
",Happy Madison at its best. Good comedy and a decent storyline. (Half a star extra for some decent action scenes too),/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2019,SnoopyStyle,6," chemistry is good
",NYPD policeman Nick Spitz (Adam Sandler) can't quite pass the detective test for the third time and hides it from his wife Audrey (Jennifer Aniston). She pushes him to go on an European vacation. She sneaks onto first class and encounters Viscount Charles Cavendish (Luke Evans) who invites the couple to a family gathering on his yacht. The family patriarch and Charles' uncle Malcolm Quince (Terence Stamp) announces that he's leaving his fortune to his new wife Suzi. He is murdered before he signs the new will. It's a wild weekend of Clue characters and it's a murder mystery. Inspector de la Croix immediately sees the Spitzes as his prime suspects and Nick has to solve the case with his wife.,/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2019,matthewssilverhammer,7," Cute Fluff
","Ya know that annoying couple who sits behind you in the theater and comments on every little thing that's happening in the movie? Murder Mystery takes that couple and places them directly within a Poirot-style story. Thankfully, when the movie works around this couple, it works. Sandler and Aniston really have great chemistry with a fluffy and cute script that's better than Sandler normally works with.",/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2019,richardkiddle,6," Adequate
",This is like all Jennifer Aniston movies-not terrible and not great but simply average. It will pass the time harmlessly on a rainy day & is entertaining if rather silly & totally unbelievable with it's wafer thin characters. A modern day Agatha Christie story but without the class.,/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2019,royhectorkabanlit,8," An Entertaining Murder Mystery Movie
","I liked the movie, I thought it was pretty good. The plot is based on the Agatha Christie novel ""Murder on the Orient Express"" which the movie did pay tribute to when the main characters rode on a train named ""The Orient Express"" on its last scene.",/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2019,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," Meh. Can't believe the amount of fake reviews.
","Great production value (sets, locations, yachts, etc) and decent directing, but the writing was bland and infantile. No LOL moments and a few smiles, but mainly cheesy humor. Even Sandler and Aniston couldn't save this screenplay. Producers should have put more efforts in the writing than in the fake reviews. A generous 6/10 from me.",/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2019,ryanazzi,7," Consistently Entertaining
","It may not be an oscar contender but it's certainly a fun time. Helped by a pretty decent cast, the movie will keep you thoroughly entertained throughout it's run time.",/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2019,henry8-3,1," Murder Mystery
","Sander and Aniston are a married couple who go on a trip to Europe, get involved with billionaires and get framed for the murder of one of them.",/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2019,Calicodreamin,9," Hilarious!
","I thought this was absolutely hilarious, Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston are amazing. They play so well off each other, the chemistry is perfect. The plot itself is pretty good, if you ignore the fact that I hardly think two nobodies would ever be invited on a billionaires yacht. the storyline moves at a fast pace, and has a nice twist at the end. A thoroughly fun movie!",/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2020,kosmasp,4," Good start --- deteriorates
","It starts off quite nicely, but does fail to engage as it continues on. Still the cast makes it somewhat worthwhile. But having seen Knives Out quite closely to this, this ... I'll say lacks tension and other things that seem so naturally in Knives out. Then again you have Adam Sandler here in his usual comedy schtick, so what should one expect other than that? Adam is able to act properly (uncut gems is supposed to be another example of that), but this is what he is know for and if that is what you came for, my opinion won't matter.",/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2019,mipeach-99400,8," It's Sandler and Aniston
","Good , Bad, OK... It don't matter, these days we hardly see any of these actors in movies anymore, and I miss them. So Critics, stay away. Go find something else to criticize, like Patterson being batman or something.",/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2019,blanche-2,8," screwball mystery inspired by Agatha Christie novels
","Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler star in ""Mystery Movie,"" 2019 film from Netflix, which set a new viewer record in its first few days of release.",/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2019,UniqueParticle,9," Excellent crime/mystery barely a comedy though
","Not sure what the hate is about sure theirs some dumb parts but this movie is awesome! Jennifer Aniston I've grown to like more over the years, I used to really dislike her acting and I always love Adam Sandler in almost anything! Netflix has definitely gotten better in the last decade since I became a subscriber in 09. Turn off your serious mind for 90 minutes and enjoy this whacky vacation extravaganza.",/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2019,laragi,2," The last days of Sandler and Aniston
","This film was long and drawn out with little humor and zero suspense. It's as if no one tried at all. The outtakes are probably better than the film, but I don't want to see them.",/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2020,JoeytheBrit,," Murder Mystery review
","Enjoyable lightweight comedy (possibly sponsored by Claritin!) from Adam Sandler that benefits greatly from the presence of the often under-rated Jennifer Aniston. They play a couple who finds themselves in the middle of the kind of old-fashioned murder mystery plot that Aniston's character loves to read. The film plays on genre tropes to decent effect and Sandler reins in the annoyance quotient, although given today's climate of gender sensitivity it's likely that vaguely ditzy female characters like Aniston's - who can pause in a moment of panic to admire some nearby wallpaper - will soon go the way of murders in the library with a candlestick.",/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2019,aidanratesmovies,2," Unfunny, generic, and nearly unwatchable
","Unbelievably awkward, tremendously unfunny, and by all means generic, Murder Mystery sparks a new low for Sandler and Aniston, or at least for Sandler a new low in a short while. The film is packed with awkward and simply unfunny jokes, placed almost perfectly at the wrong time everytime. The only laughs I gave towards the film, was towards its completely self arrogant manner and its confused tone of whether it wanted or not to be the parody film it may or may not have been trying to be. All the performances varied from fine, to just plain bland, and some just plain terrible and racist. The script is a mess, the dialogue is atrocious, and each line's delivery seems like it was not only written but also said drunk. All in all, this is what to be expected from an Adam Sandler comedy these days and sadly it fits those expectations perfectly,
My Rating: 2.5/10",/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2019,ops-52535,7," not so bad after all
","Comedy today means instant use of vocabularistic artistery, and the fun is tucked within there. but this is a kind of exception, with a good lard of action inbetween, and the car chase near the end are merely superb,and fun.",/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2019,Cheshire_Cat_Grin,9," A fun who-done-it
","This film is entertaining, fun, and very enjoyable. This is one of those movies where you can just sit back, unwind, and forget about things for about an hour and a half. The acting is great. The script is engaging. The setting is interesting. The whole family can watch this, but I think it would be more alluring to young adults and up. The story is a who-done-it with some low level comedy mixed in. I enjoyed this movie so much that I'm hoping that there will be a sequel. I don't know, but the way that this film ends.....there could easily be a continuation to Nick and Audrey's story. So far, this is one of my favorite movies this year.",/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2019,danwilberforce,1," Can't believe I finished it.
","When a comedy isn't funny and you guess who did it as soon as the deed is done there, isn't much left to care about. Boring, unfunny and entirely unimaginative. Others seem to have liked it, but personally I wouldn't waste your time.",/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2019,pedro-jl-pereira,3," Not comedy, a tragedy!!
","Sandler made very good movies in the 90s but some how he start losing his touch. I think that he doesnt care anymore. The acting is bad, but its a comedy so thats not the important element. Its just not funny at all. Lame and childish jokes, every moment, i didnt smile the hole movie. What are you doing sandler???! Such a waste of money and talent.",/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2019,Isee-stupid-people,1," Horrible
",How can a high budget comedy be so unfunny? Put 2019 adam sandler in it. Its so unfunny it's actually annoying,/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2019,NBates1,2," Cringe-worthy
","This movie has been done (a LOT) before and done better. The only reason I bothered to give it a 2 is for the location and the Ferrari scene.
Not a single joke was funny, some were just painful.
Sandler and Aniston, an overrated duo, play the same dull characters they always do, trying way too hard to be quirky and funny, and failing miserably.
The plot twists were honestly dumb and predictable and character behaviors in some parts didn't make sense.
Only worth watching if you're really bored.",/review/rw4948922/?ref_=tt_urv
