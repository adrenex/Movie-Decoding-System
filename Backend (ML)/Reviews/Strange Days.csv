25 November 2019,amcc9,10," Different but excellent
","I was such a huge fan of the Megan Follows depiction of the beloved character Anne. This depiction is also superb. So moving and so much more emotion than the former. They cannot be compared, one no less better than the other. Different but oh so excellent and beautifully acted. I love it!",/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of the best shows I have ever watched I highly recommend it to everyone doesn't matter what age you are. Everyone will find something interesting in it. Amazing acting, scenography, costumes, music and of course storylines",/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2019,dosblakey,10," Great series
",I loved the books Anne of Green Gables. This is a great series and I am not put off by the embellishments added to the stories in the books. In fact the books left me wanting more. This is worth watching.,/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2017,mstaffordca,10," Brilliant and flawless
","I had to write a review for this show because it's better than any other A.O.G.G. that I've ever seen!!! This show has so much heart and emotion! I was hooked from the start and can't wait for the next episode!!! I would give it 100 stars if I could! Whomever rated the 2/10 or 1/10 either has the wrong show or is completely out of their minds (sorry)! I hope the creators of this show read all the wonderful reviews!! It seems now a days all the great shows, such as this, are going unrecognized and it makes me sad. We need more shows like this.!",/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2019,kcomaskey,10," AMAZING #renewannewithane
",This is one of the most beautiful shows I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I have read the books and though it differs from the books it truly is the closest to perfect television we have gotten in the past 10 years or so. It tackles modern day issues that have been alive throughout time and does so in a thought provoking fascinating way. The acting and production are second to none and it truly deserves another season to continue the storytelling. Anne Shirley Cuthburt is a passionate individual and so are her fans! She is a true role model for every young person today.,/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2020,mfellipecampos,," ""Anne With An E"" canceled due to low audience, says website
","It is true that we never got over the cancellation of ""Anne With An E"", one of the most acclaimed series by the public over the last few years. The production, based on the book ""Anne of Green Gables"", by Lucy Maud Montgomery, was a joint responsibility of the CBC channel and Netflix.",/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2019,blpkst,9," Mean Girls - 19th Century
","I'd like to recommend this Netflix series to my friends who are raising girls, especially, but some boys may enjoy the series too. ""Anne"" based on the book ""Anne of Green Gables"" has a lot to offer modern day girls even though this girl, Anne, lives in the 19th Century. She's had some hard knocks in an orphanage when her luck changes and she gets adopted. She's bright, has her own ideas, has trouble making friends, and is quite endearing. This is a rich and enriching series that you can watch together with your kids and have real conversations. Many topics, problems, problem solving and values sprinkle throughout the episodes. 19th and 21st Century have a lot in common when it comes to mean girls.",/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2017,vicstevinson,10," Excellent casting, beautifully directed
","I read the books when I was third and fourth grade; watched the previous miniseries and movie adaptations, and am thoroughly enchanted by this new series. Amybeth McNulty embodies Anne in new light and delivers a fully-formed character. Three episodes in and I am hooked on the evolution of so many characters.",/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2019,fab88,10," Joyful heartwarming series
","What an adventure. I loved every single character. Beautiful scenery, beautiful tales of love in its very ways. I fell in love with the main characters right away. 10/10",/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2017,nowego,8," A big fan of the original
","Prior to seeing the original 1980's series I had never read the books, but completed that task a few years ago over about a month. My love for the original series grew even stronger after reading the books and I have watched it many many times and I am a big fan of Megan Fellows.",/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2019,adlerlaurel,10," Anne with an E, forever and always Amazing
","I absolutely love Anne with an E, it's smooth and eye-catching cinematography and use of setting really helps set the scene in Avonlea. All the actors play their characters with such splendid ease, it's almost second nature to them. The acting is phenomenal! You just can't help but fall in love with Anne (Amybeth McNulty), a fierce red-haired dreamer, with a beautiful soul. The writers and creators of the show have developed a modern take on our beloved ""Anne of Green Gables"" with new and old entertaining and emotional moments that fans and viewers alike can cherish. I can only hope that we (the fans) can hopefully get a season 4, because after watching the season 3 finale, it's become so much clearer that even though Anne has to spread her wings at Queen's we wish that we could be taken along the way to see the rest of her journey. Renewal or not, Anne with an E is a fierce, groundbreaking, and forward thinking show that teaches us all to be kinder to one another and notice the little things in life especially in our world today. Anne has thought me so much about myself, and I'm so glad she did. So Anne with an E will always have a little place in my heart, now and forever.",/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2019,rrparanal,10," Anne With An E series: MUST WATCH
","The series is incredible from the writing, cinematography, acting, & set/lighting design. This adaptation gives rich back stories to almost all of the Anne supporting characters creating an amazing world filled with hope, loss, redemption, & love. I've never experienced a character that I connected with so intensely- not even LMM's version of Anne. This production's unflinching presentation of all of Anne's predilections- good & bad- make for such a rich & effervescent character. HIGHY RECOMMEND",/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2020,chetbakergold,5," Fine show. But it is not Anne of Green Gables
","The show is well made, acting is good, sets are nice. However, modern media has once again ruined a timeless classic by injecting it with their modern ideas and dilemmas and social issues. Don't get me wrong, a show about a young girl in the late 1800s dealing with abuse and hardship and all the struggles involved growing up in that time sounds like a great show. But it is NOT Anne of Green Gables. This is supposed to be a happy, wholesome show that teaches life lessons. Not this mangled mess. They're just capitalizing on the Anne franchise name. Another big issue is Anne's character. She is so unlikeable, cringey, manipulative and conniving. That is so wrong. Yes, book Anne lies sometimes and has a temper, but the show could not have gotten her more wrong.",/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2019,fridastenmark-07747,10," WATCH ANNE WITH AN E
","Anne with an E manages to bring up topics that we rarely see in period dramas. It shows the importance of family, friends, nature, and above all, staying true to yourself. You fall in love with the characters so easily, but they aren't portrayed as perfect, everyone has their flaws but I think that's why so many people are able to relate to them. Anne has made me a better person. I've started to appreciate things I didn't before, it's like I got a new pair of eyes. Nonetheless I recommend it to everyone, no matter the age, give it a try. It will only do you good.",/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2020,eryui,10," So easy to love this series
","The main character is so sweet and lovable, a hymn to life, love, the beauty of nature, friendship, adolescence, emotions.
The wonderful setting, photography, music, everything is perfectly intertwined.
Often moving, the series has a good rhythm, different themes and is really compelling and deep in its apparent simplicity.",/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2017,lgallon,10," Wonderful! Exceeded My Expectations.
","My exceptions of this revival was very low as I felt nothing could compare to Kevin Sullivan's 1985 adaptation. My expectations were exceeded tremendously!! This version is absolutely splendid so far. I never thought another actress could portray Anne as well as Megan Follows, but I was mistaken, as Amybeth McNulty does a phenomenal job of Anne's portrayal. ",/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2019,sidkashyap,10," What a beautiful, beautiful show...
","And not just in terms of cinematography (which makes you want to pack your bags and head to Prince Edward Island right this second), but also in terms of the the heart and soul that has been put into the show which is clearly evident. Without spoiling anything this show has -

26 November 2019,tegancharlton-47798,10," Absolutely brilliant
","Anne with an E is exactly the show that we need in our world today. It deals with all kinds of important topics such as residential schools, women's rights, black history, and the LGBTQ community. It does so in an heart warming, educational, and kid friendly manner. Anne with an E is also brilliantly made in every department from casting to costume design to cinematography. It is a fabulous Canadian show that everyone show that everyone should watch",/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2018,korpake,1," Amazing Acting. Wonderful Attention to Setting. Terrible storyline.
","The actors are great. The main actress is really quite incredible. 10 out of 10.
They have created the setting so well. Really loved watching the scenery. 
But in terms of story line, they started out well, then it went downhill.",/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2017,harpreetc,1," If you love the book, you will steer clear of this dystopia.
","I was just seeing the revamped version of Anne of Green Gables on Netflix. It is everything that the '84 adaptation of the book is not. The book written in 1908 deals with a lot of hard-hitting issues in such a beautiful pastoral manner, and the Kevin Sullivan version actually did a wonderful job in adapting it.",/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2017,HarryPotterIsGarbage,9," The drama is amplified in this version of Anne
","A lot of negative feedback seems to be along the lines of ""it doesn't feel the same"". As someone who never cared about the original series or book, I actually enjoyed watching this and appreciated the dramatic approach that the writers took for this version of Anne. In fact, I liked this enough to give the 1985 version a rewatch, only to find out that the new 2017 version is far superior in every way -- better drama overall, and targets a wider audience, not just for those watching it for nostalgia. Don't watch this show just for nostalgia. Try to set your bias aside.",/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2017,frisco2007,1," Spoilers Included - Appalling.
","Spoilers Included - Appalling. This adaptation of L.M. Montgomery's novel Anne of Green Gables is appalling. Wrong in so many ways. While it does at some moments oddly verbatim use the material it states it is based on, it also rabidly changes the story, and introduces things that are heinous. I have read the original book, and also seen the ""gold standard TV movie adaptation"" starring Megan Follows. The original book is a work of ""romantic idealism fiction"" where an orphan overcomes odds and achieves, shines and is someone irresistible to love; she is presented as a brilliant girl at 11 years old, intensely imaginative, intelligent, and grows over the course of the book into a mature and remarkable near-genius level female protagonist. And where she lives, Green Gables and Avonlea, is a place of radiant beauty. And in this halcyon setting, she has her life- positive adventures and grows. In the first 3 episodes of this adaptation, she does things that are unthinkable for a smart girl like her - tells sex stories to her friends which Anne Shirley was too smart not to know to keep her mouth shut about, she had better judgment than that, whatever her famous dreaminess and distractedness, she tells Matthew to leave her alone when he comes to rescue her from homelessness at the train station in a totally non-canon invented set of scenes - an act blasphemous to the kindred spirit basis of their relationship, she is mistreated or called names by almost everyone in Avonlea miserably - actions not possible to the ACTUAL characters in Avonlea - most of whom are kind, benevolent. There is a new, unexisting, needless character in the show - the boy who helps Matthew. The boys bark at her, expressing she is an ugly dog, the girls mock her, as opposed to embracing her for her remarkable imagination and personality that brightens their life WHICH THEY do in the book. There is no HATE in the book. There is in this show. After the sex conversation, Prissy Andrews' brother attempts to beat up Anne, and she is weirdly rescued by Gilbert Blythe, which is NOT how they meet, and to Anne Shirley, the romance of that would have changed her outlook on and endeared him to her, and instead she scorns him to fit in with the girls. This is NOT Anne of Green Gables. It is a rearrangement of it putting false words in the characters' mouths, false actions into the characters' lives. Anne Shirley was not ""adopted"" by the Cuthberts and she certainly did not disrespect her real parent's memory by changing her name. As literature goes, this adaptation is blasphemy and sacrilege of a beloved novel. It's grittiness is totally out of line. If you want to make a TV show about an orphan in troubled circumstances, you can, do a new story, but don't leech off of L.M. Montgomery's immortal classic. The absurdity of a newspaper boy calling out ""Scientists predict Greenhouse effect"" hilariously tops off the ridiculous ways this adaptation tries to ""do it's own thing and modern motifs"" with a sacred life positive work of literature. All of this bad adaptation was definitely not part of anything of the material this is ""based on"" and can pollute your memories of the original book. And it's own story does not make a good original story either. Shameful!!!",/review/rw3706653/?ref_=tt_urv
