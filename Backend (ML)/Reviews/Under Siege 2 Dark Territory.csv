8 November 2021,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,7," ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐½
","I am surprised this film has gotten so much hate. I didn't think it was terrible. Certainly not anything below a five. I liked that Jason Sudeikis can do more than straight comedy. I acknowledge there wasn't much on screen chemistry between Jason Sudeikis and Evangeline Lilly, however, the film was entertaining. There was comedic chemistry between Sudeikis and the boy, Thaddeus J. Mixson. I got a couple of chuckles watching the two.",/review/rw8263457/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2022,Gordon-11,," A romance film
","""South of Heaven"" tells a story of a criminal who got out of prison, and is dragged back into the world of crime. However, the focus is the love story, so it is better conceptualised as a romance film with a criminal protagonist. This is perhaps why people who are expecting adrenaline end up being disappointed by this film.",/review/rw8263457/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2021,jeff-2051,8," Yes. The Story Has Been Done Before, But . . .
","It's far above the average films made for 16-year old boys in this country. The story is tight, as is the acting, cinematography, locations and casting.",/review/rw8263457/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2021,Draysan-Jennings,6," What Happened
",This movie started out great. It had A Simple Plan/Fargo kinda feel to it. Then right after the son gets kidnapped it goes completely downhill. There was a good 30 to 40 minutes where it felt like I was watching a totally different movie. And whatever happened to the missing 500k? It never gets explained. The mob boss has a conversation with Annie and apparently all is forgiven. Also what was up with that strange shot in the end. Who the hell was sitting on the boat in the middle of a lake? Was that supposed to be Jimmy hunched over dead? I didn't get it. When all said and done despite the second half it was a decent movie. Not something I'd watch again but worth checking out. 6 stars.,/review/rw8263457/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2021,deloudelouvain,5," Started okay but ultimately it failed.
","Well I have to agree with the negative reviews for once. Despite the good cast and an interesting first half the movie quality went downhill pretty fast. There are a lot of scenes that weren't good at all, that didn't make much sense and that brought the quality of the story down. As for the acting there were some actors that were not convincing at all at times. And I'm not talking about extras but major actors. I don't know what happened, it started good but it turned bad at one point and it never recovered. Too bad because it had potential.",/review/rw8263457/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2022,TxMike,," Paroled Texas convict tries to go straight for his dying girlfriend.
","While I understand why many rate this movie poorly, to me it is a bit better than its IMDb rating. Again, to me, it starts off with signs of a totally serious movie but about half-way turns into what I would describe as a very dark comedy, with lots of dirty money involved. The ""good"" guys start to figure out ways to get the best of the ""bad"" guys and that type of story is always fun to watch.",/review/rw8263457/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2022,treeguy710,7," 5.7 imdb you r wack
","I gave it a 7.3, out of ten because the editing and unanswered q s. But, I think the woman(Anne)was astounding, and only did I find out in the credits that it was actually Evangeline Lilly, thus began my mind to be blown. Wow! Great performance!!!",/review/rw8263457/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2021,batemi2000,5," MISSED OPPORTUNITY...
","Pretty good story but turns out the director/writer doesn't have what it takes to bring it to life. What happened tot he 500k that was supposed to be the cause of all the conflict? Obviously, our hero and his friend didn't take it, but the writers didn't deem it necessary to explain how the money disappeared. Then when Price's men came looking for Jimmy in Mexico and he had to run for miles to get back to his wife, I think it's very unlikely that anyone would walk such a far distance to get supplies, especially when he has a truck. I really loved Evangeline Lily here and the story was quite engaging, that is until the end when Jimmy, who according to his wife was not a criminal, picked up a gun and went into the bad guys lair to bump them off like some PG rated John Wick.",/review/rw8263457/?ref_=tt_urv

",This movie's plot could have solved in two minutes had Sudakis's character done one simple thing: gone to the authorities and reported his no good parole officer who was more than likely already on their radar.

","""South of Heaven"" opens with Jimmy (Jason Sudeikis) at a parole hearing, imploring for a chance to make up for twelve years of lost time with his betrothed Annie (Evangeline Lilly). She's dying of cancer - reckon she has about a year left. The walls are closing in. He ½starts giving the ""I Had A Speech Prepared, But"" monologue, and I confess that two minutes into the film, I am resisting the urge to furrow my brow. I try to keep my heart open, but there was apprehension at what I felt was... stock sentimentality. Call me a cynic.",/review/rw8263457/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2021,developmentczar,1," Jason Sudeikis is now joining the Bruce Willis Club.
","Welcome Jason. Have a seat next to Willis, Cage and Travolta. This might be Jason's first C movie but likely won't be his last. This script has to rank up there with some of the worst ever; cliche, banal, and predictable. Evangeline Lilly looked completely lost and she was trying way too hard. And good 'ol one-note Shea Whigham plays every single character the same. He gets cast because his bro Jack is a big-time agent formerly with CAA. Jack would ""force"" package Shea into any films that a producer wanted to cast the big stars whom he repped.",/review/rw8263457/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,jeroduptown,5," Post Prison Trap
","Sudeikis, refreshingly, doesn't exactly fit the role of a convict on parole that wants to spend a year with his lifelong love, Lilly. But everyone is a caricature of the role that they play and it tanks the possibilities of the crime/thriller part of the film.",/review/rw8263457/?ref_=tt_urv
