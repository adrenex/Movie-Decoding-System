22 January 2023,A_Different_Drummer,7," It's a generational thing...
","Recently the ""reboot"" of CSI:VEGAS (2021) ran into a tiny spot of trouble. No viewers. To solve the problem, the producers coaxed some of the original stars out of retirement to put in cameos, trying to create a ""bridge"" between the old show and the new one. And that, in a nutshell, is the key to CHEMISTRY OF DEATH. It is not MORSE. It is not LEWIS. In fact, nothing about the show is done in a way that is intended to appeal to viewers who grew up on the traditional ""English"" mysteries. The pace is faster. The editing is faster. Voice-overs replace music. Shocking the viewer with jump-cuts and ""big reveals"" is not only acceptable, but actually encouraged. This is indeed a new generation of mystery show, and its success or failure will most certainly hinge on the charisma of Harry Treadaway. The same actor whose strong performances in MR MERCEDES, and STAR TREK PICARD, mesmerized viewers during his limited screentime. Clearly, the producers here felt that it was time to give Treadaway his own show, stand back, and see what happens. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

",If you're tiring of the Brit Forensic drama Silent Witness then Chemistry of Death should reignite some interest in the genre.,/review/rw8846738/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,artabuneta,4," Boring and derivative
","What a bore. Every character here is a clich√©, the plot predictable and derivative.",/review/rw8846738/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you were looking something to remind you of the original True Detectives (other than the chemistry between Rust and Marty), i guess this is it.",/review/rw8846738/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,godsnames,7," Dark as hell, it follows the Nordic film noir path quite convincingly
","The best about this show is undoubtedly the cinematography. Many times, it just takes the breath away. And not just the landscapes, but rather how they use it to depict characters, the scene, the environment they are in, the mood, the atmosphere. That is outstanding, 10/10. The story is arresting, dark from the very start, and just goes on and on to build up the protagonist of the series, a forensic pathologist riddled with guilt about his past. I would say, that's the less convincing - however, vital - element of the character, the theme about it well overused (in my opinion). The score is good, original and well in sync with the cinematography. One of the best English series in recent years. You won't be disappointed if you watch it, for sure.",/review/rw8846738/?ref_=tt_urv

","I like almost everything about this show - the actors, their acting, camera, music, wow! Also the choice of locations is awesome.",/review/rw8846738/?ref_=tt_urv

","Bad pacing, underdeveloped characters, and lacking in plot.",/review/rw8846738/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,becky-comer,5," Not a single credible norfolk accent
",I'm quite enjoying this first episode but have to say I'm really disappointed that for a drama set in rural norfolk no one could be bothered to replicate an even slightly genuine norfolk accent.,/review/rw8846738/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2023,stevejwesley,5," Nothing new......
","Started well, but let's be honest, you've seen it a thousand times before. I personally get particularly frustrated by a father constantly chasing the shadow of a passed child, but then that's just me. It's difficult to invest in any one of the characters, especially the lead role. Thankfully it doesn't delve into the Dexter/Da Vinci's Demons style crime scene overview each time he assesses a dead body or that would be it!",/review/rw8846738/?ref_=tt_urv
