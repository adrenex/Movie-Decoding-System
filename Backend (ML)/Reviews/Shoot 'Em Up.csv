",Another great sitcom from Nickelodeon. iCarly preserves Drake and Josh's legacy with a show equally as funny and emotional. I love these characters and their reactions to different situations! Nickelodeon just doesn't make sitcoms like this anymore.,/review/rw2604393/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2015,RNMorton,9," Spectacular
","Nick has started re-running this series and it reminded me of how really solid it was from start to finish. It was a combination of three key factors - great series concept (teenage girls running their own daily webcast), fantastic ensemble casting, and really good writing show in and show out. Victorious took awhile to get going, ended up being okay, but nothing Nick in this genre has ever consistently scored like this. Maybe nothing ever scored like this in the teen genre. Miranda provides the core of the show, Freddie is the ultimate good guy without being overdone, while Sam is a unique teen show character for the ages. Like early SpongeBob, this show has amazing viewing range, my 9 year old watches it regularly now (as my 13 year old did in its first run), and I've enjoyed each episode. Unlike SpongeBob, this show ended at exactly the right time. Kudos.",/review/rw2604393/?ref_=tt_urv

","In my personal opinion, this is the last excellent Nick show. Although that Victorious and Brain Surge look cool, when this show ends, I probably won't watch Nick again.",/review/rw2604393/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2020,IDCwhatYouThink,10," Miss this show....
","I know I'm late to the party on this one, but I miss it. I was planning to write a longer review right now, but thadiusmain took the words right out of my mouth. I love this show for every reason that reviewer said. Back when this was on the air, I was in the worst spot of my life. I was a recent college grad with no job prospects and unemployed. This show was the only thing that could make me smile at that time. I'd watch it to ease my stress and just relax and disappear from the world. Of course, I do remember browsing online job sites while I watched it too, but this show kept me company when I thought the world was against me and I had virtually no self-esteem from being rejected by so many employers, so thank you for the quality entertainment throughout your 5 year run. This show will ALWAYS hold a special place in my heart!",/review/rw2604393/?ref_=tt_urv

24 August 2008,Ddey65,," iWon't lie: I think it's a cute kids' show, even if uHate puns like this title.
","It seems like with everything Dan Schneider has produced, semi-spin-offs are inevitable. It certainly would seem that way with every kids' show he has produced. Amanda Bynes became such a force on ""All That,"" she got her own variety show, which she was much better than. Former All That & Amanda Show cast-members Drake Bell & Josh Peck got a show of their own, and now Miranda Cosgrove, who played Drake's little sister on that one gets her own show here.",/review/rw2604393/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2009,dee.reid,10," iHeart ""iCarly""
","""iCarly"" is not a bad show in the least. It's about a teenage girl in Seattle named Carly (Miranda Cosgrove) who hosts her own live Internet web-show with her tomboy-ish best friend Sam (Jennette McCurdy) and producer/cameraman Freddie (Nathan Kress). Carly also lives with her sculptor older brother/legal guardian Spencer (Jerry Trainor).",/review/rw2604393/?ref_=tt_urv

11 May 2008,sirguitarist,10," My daughter loves this show....and okay, iDo too.
","There is not a lot out there that a guy my age can watch with his 11 year old daughter. Most of prime time network TV is way too adult themed to feel good about letting her watch, and many of the kid shows are just too annoying for my tastes. Along comes iCarly, a show my daughter and I have watched from the beginning. The show is definitely aimed at kids, but there are enough funny moments (often provided by Spencer, played by Jerry Trainor) to keep me interested as well. All of the four main characters (Carly, Sam, Freddy and Spencer) are likable and have good chemistry. You get the feeling that they like each other off the set as well. As the first season is coming to an end, I can only hope they'll continue making more. I recommend this for any Dad (who has a sense of humor and still knows how to be a kid once in a while) to watch with his kid(s).",/review/rw2604393/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2008,flickhead,9," Quality tween programming!
","Nik have a bonafide hit on their hands with this charming vehicle for the talents of star Miranda Cosgrove (formerly a supporting cast member and frequent scene-stealer on Drake & Josh). Created by former Head of the Class alumni, Dan Schneider, iCarly follows the adventures of a Seattle teen and her friends under the supervision of her unconventional older brother while her father is deployed abroad in military service. The cast is wonderful. Schneider has taken his knack for discovering young talent to new heights with this gifted ensemble whose singular and collective abilities frequently rise above the material -which is pretty good to begin with. As with previous discovery Amanda Bynes, Miranda Cosgrove exhibits tremendous skill and good comic timing coupled with honest-to-goodness likability. The same can be said of co-stars Nathan Kress, Jeanette McCurdy and Jerry Trainor who perfect a balance of silliness and earnestness without crossing into ridiculous or unbelievable territory. None of them oversell a bit or mug camera like in certain other Nik or Disney shows. With writing that is far from juvenile while still appealing to a young audience, iCarly is quite enjoyable and proves that youth programming doesn't have to pander to the lowest common denominator to attract an audience. Good, solid programming.",/review/rw2604393/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2013,SanteeFats,7," Pretty good
","I started watching iCarly in the middle of season 3 or 4. I found the show to be nonsensically funny. While the Sam character has reasons to be so mean there are times where she goes way overboard in my opinion. Of course this can be attributed to teen age hormones running rampant I suppose. Freddy is the only real reason they have a web show from what I can tell. Without his tech knowledge it doesn't seem as if there could be a broadcast. What's with Gibby and pulling his shirt off all the time? He sure ain't purty to look at with a shirt on. Carly is a warm hearted cutie who appears to only see the best in most people she runs into. Although she will go after a really bad one. The brother is a bit off center but he is an artist. How they earn income is never addressed. The brother sells a piece from time to time but where does the money come from for all the monthly expenses? Maybe daddy colonel? I find this show to be funny and at times it actually seems to address some aspects of teenage angst and growing pains. (With Sam around actual pain too, the butter sock is cool but wouldn't it start to drip or squish out when it warmed up)? Freddy's mom is even more off center than the brother. How Freddy turned out fairly normal with her around is a credit to the writers.",/review/rw2604393/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2012,junkmailstuff456,10," iCarly is hilarious
","Such a great show! iCarly may be stupid, pointless, and unrealistic... but it gives you a good laugh!!! I have to admit, some of the characters are very stupid, but they're funny, which is what counts! Spencer is goofy, and exactly what you'd want in an older brother. Freddie is cute and techie. Carly is a goody goody, but she's a good character. Sam is funny, but violent and mean. T-Bo is hilarious... And Gibby... Gibby... Well Gibby's just Gibby. This show is very unique, and original. Most Disney shows are just the same concept over and over, but Nickelodeon is good at coming up with good, new ideas. I really like this show, and when it ends, I'll be very sad :(",/review/rw2604393/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2007,foolishsker,9," Funny as ever
","OK so you have this girl, Carly, living with her artistic brother Spencer. Carly has a best friend named Sam, when they are forced into doing their schools auditions for the talent show they see that a lot of their class mates have awesome talents. So long story short they start up some webisodes called ""iCarly"" were they host many wonderful and yet random talented people. This is all done with the help of Carly's annoying neighbor, Freddie, who also has a crush on Carly.",/review/rw2604393/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2008,Floated2,9," very good show
","iCarly is a very good show to watch, its fun and has its entertainment. When i first heard about this show, i had mixed feelings and didn't know what to expect, but that has changed. This show is great and fun to watch. Its about a girl named Carly and her 2 friends (Sam & Freddie) who do a web cast on the internet. The plot seems simple but its actually entertaining and every episode seems different and new. Carly lives with her older brother Spencer in an apartment.",/review/rw2604393/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2010,Rectangular_businessman,1," Painfully bad
","Words are not enough to express my hatred by this stupid, insufferable show...What happened with the good shows of Nickelodeon, like ""Clarissa explains it all"" or ""Pete & Pete""? This shows is not only stupid and unfunny, but also incredible annoying as well, filled with inappropriate humor and unlikeable characters. All the characters of this show are annoying and irritating, and all behave like morons. The worst part of it is that none of them is funny or interesting at, all, their idiocy is only annoying and repetitive.",/review/rw2604393/?ref_=tt_urv

","ICarly has to of been one of Nickelodeon's best tween sitcoms. It is about a teenage girl named Carly who has her own web show with her Bff Sam Puckett as the cohost and her neighbor and other Best Friend as the technical producer. The characters are loveable with Sam's fierce attitude, Carly sweet appearance and adorable Freddie. I love iCarly! P.S. I know this is the but I wish a new sitcom will be as great as this in 2020...",/review/rw2604393/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2015,divyanka,9," iCarly - Wonderfully humorous, entertaining characters, engaging episodes
","This show is one of the best sitcoms I have ever seen in my life. It was a super hilarious, relaxed, and very entertaining show. Yes, it did have its inappropriate parts, which I do not appreciate. That being said, these things dominate western TV and cannot be eliminated, as much as I would like them to be. These undesirable elements can be found in just about every sitcom AND cartoon, despite them being aimed at young viewers. So, ignoring some of the inappropriate parts, this show was an excellent sitcom. In fact, it is by far the most hilarious show I have watched. The characters had wonderfully refreshing and hilarious personalities, and all the actors were smooth and great at playing out their roles. Freddie, Sam, and Spencer are all great actors in the show, as well as Carly. None of the adults are boring either, such as Freddie's mother. However, Lewbert was one very annoying and gross character. It is sad that such great shows are not made anymore.",/review/rw2604393/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2020,mitsubishizero,8," Hilarious and cleverly written
","This was one of nicks best shows. Miranda Cosgrove as the title character is one of the best characters to be created. She can funny, clumsy and cunning when need be. Sam as the grouchy, unhinges rebel and Freddie as the sympathetic fall guy.",/review/rw2604393/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2007,dino_cale16,," iCool
","iCarly captures a not-so-common life of a pre-teen girl perfectly. A smart, witty, funny girl and her best friend Sam have cool life having an awesome hobby (a TV Show), a spacious condo or apartment and her guardian is her 26 year old brother. It is one of those few shows where it's centered around a teenage girl, but guys can relate to it really well especially with the eccentric Spencer and the adorable yet sometimes annoying Freddy. I like iCarly mainly because I am a sucker for 21st century sitcoms and dramas like Drake and Josh and sometimes Zoey 101. Some of them may be girly but I love watching how kids/teens act with everyday things encountering their life. iCarly has a well rounded personality making this the best Nick sitcom in my view.",/review/rw2604393/?ref_=tt_urv
