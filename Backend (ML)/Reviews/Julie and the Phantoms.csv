12 February 2005,dbborroughs,8," Better than you think it is
",The story of a superstar singer who falls in love with her bodyguard could have been a major disaster. I remember the previews and thinking it was going to be one. However once the film was out and I actually watched it I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this is a really good romance and a really good thriller. Of course its hokey and Hollywood and all of that but you get sucked in and carried along for its running time.,/review/rw2568136/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2020,cjonesas,10," Oh my goodness!
","There was a time when there were no internet for me, no video and no satellite.
I was a 19 y.o. boy, young and full of emotions. A naive young fellow knowing nothing about life and its twists.
One day, while waiting at a bus station, I overheard two friends talking about a movie called 'The Bodyguard' and that how good that was, how they enjoyed it and how Withney Houston shone in it.
Years passed, I lived my life, but I always had memory of that conversation in the back of my mind as if waiting for the right moment and opportunity to grab and watch that film.
And opportunity it came one day with its video from a friend. I put the cassette in the player and started watching the anticipated movie with unbelievable excitement and happiness.",/review/rw2568136/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2006,PWNYCNY,10," Wonderful Movie
","Oh my, what a wonderful movie. Hollywood is known for churning out a lot of sentimental mush that's supposed to pass for romance. But, thankfully, this is not one of those movies. In this movie the main characters, the bodyguard and the lady he is hired to protect, are likable and have a relationship that develops into something really beautiful and special. Moreover, the story is plausible and the movie is well-acted too, with Whitney Houston turning in an outstanding performance reminiscent of Diana Ross's in Lady Sings the Blues (which is another great movie). If you want to watch a movie with good acting and an engaging story, then this is the movie to watch.",/review/rw2568136/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2020,masonsaul,7," Really good romantic drama
","Despite a few dumb twists, The Bodyguard is a really good romantic drama. Kevin Costner is great in the lead role and Whitney Houston is really good in her debut role and they have good chemistry. It's well paced, well filmed and Mick Jackson's direction is good. The music by Alan Silvestri is really good and the soundtrack is excellent.",/review/rw2568136/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2008,mlwjah,," Great Saturday Night Movie
","Why do people trash this movie? It's not high art but it's thoroughly entertaining. WH's performance in this movie is better than all her others...just watch the scene when she asks Frank Farmer to take her on a date. Natural, unaffected and charming. Kevin Costner underplays his role and I enjoyed watching him. I just bought the anniversary DVD and it has great backstage footage and very interesting tidbits. For example, it was Kevin Costner's idea, against a lot of protest, to have WH sing the first few bars of 'I will Always Love You' acapella. Smart man. And it is interesting to listen to the comments of Costner about this movie. He was a major star but he waited and held up production of this movie a year so he could get WH. He didn't want anyone else and was willing to wait for her. He refused to interject a story line that would 'explain' the Black/White thing (Bravo). And although Black/White pairings are fairly common now, THEN, for a major star to have a real black love interest ( and an untested actress at that) was a bold move. And it paid off. I don't know why he has not been as successful recently. The DVD interviews were done about 2 yrs ago and WH was still drug crazy (so no interviews with her) but Kevin Costner's last words in the interviews are about her and he said, among other things, that he would always love Whitney. Their chemistry was spot on. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE THIS MOVIE.",/review/rw2568136/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2020,jromanbaker,10," Underrated film
","Inter-racial relationships in a mainstream Hollywood film were rare back in 1992 and this was quite a revolutionary film, as it showed how normal it looked and not really questioned, and yet the poster of the time did a lot to underplay that. And Whitney Houston could really act, fragile and tough at the same time. I have reservations about Kevin Costner as an actor, but somehow he is right in this film and apparently wanted to act with Houston a lot. The plot is simple, but exciting to watch and the electricity between Costner and Huston is erotic, beautiful to see and the tender love scene with what looked like a samurai sword between them riveting to watch. Caught this on a UK channel. and it is rarely showed. A fine film that should be seen and shown on television more often in the UK than it is. I liked it back in 1992 and I like it even better now. A lot of details like the fund raising event for AIDS showed how exactly the film was aware of its time. Dramatic, tender and well worth re-evaluation.",/review/rw2568136/?ref_=tt_urv

20 July 2006,JamesHitchcock,6," Adequate Thriller-Romance
","I was interested to note from your ""Trivia"" page that it was originally intended to make this film in the seventies with Steve McQueen and Diana Ross in the leading roles, but that the film never got made because it was ""too controversial"". The cause of the controversy was presumably the mixed-race love-affair between Frank and Rachel, as there is little else in the script that might upset anyone. The story centres around Frank Farmer, a former Secret Service agent now working as a private bodyguard. He is hired by Rachel Marron, an African-American pop star, who has been receiving death threats, presumed to come from a mad stalker. Frank's obsessive concern with security initially alienates both Rachel and some of the other members of her entourage, but, after a number of misunderstandings, he becomes first her friend and then her lover. He, however, is unhappy about becoming emotionally involved with a client and ends the affair. He would also like to end his employment with Rachel, but she is becoming genuinely frightened for her own safety, and he agrees to stay on to protect her when it is clear that she is in danger from an unexpected source.",/review/rw2568136/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2017,BeccaGudd,8," A great film, underrated in my opinion
","I don't know why The Bodyguard hasn't got a higher rating than 6 stars?! I think that this film maybe only appeals to a certain audience. Whitney Houston plays the part of Rachel Marron a singing superstar who has recently became the victim of an obsessed stalker. Kevin Costner plays the part of her newly appointed bodyguard, Frank Farmer. Without going too much into it, Rachel and Frank end up falling for each other. However because Frank is hired to be her bodyguard, the lines get blurred as Rachel wants more. The music in the film in my opinion play a big role. As most of the songs were hits of Whitney Houston and the soundtrack was very successful. I didn't like the albino stalker guy in it, he was very creepy. Overall I love this film, it may not be for everyone but I've seen a lot worse.",/review/rw2568136/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2021,mark.waltz,7," Still a crowd-pleaser, and oh that soundtrack.
","Take probably the most beautiful pop singer of the past 30 years, give her a slew of obvious hits to be and a thrilling story, and you've got the makings of a smash movie. Give her probably the biggest movie hero of the past 30 years, and you've got the makings of the stuff that legendary screen romance is made of. They are Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner, and once you get past the feeling that this is a forced interracial romance, you can actually see how it progresses.",/review/rw2568136/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2011,charlotte-yonge,9," I didn't like it that much the first time around...
","but oh! it was magic to see it again after all these years. Probably the most awkward time to do so, alone, in the middle of the night, when most IMDb reviews suggested to watch it with your ""sweetheart"", i rebelled, thinking I can handle the oozing cheese coming out of the film from all sides.",/review/rw2568136/?ref_=tt_urv

21 September 2011,TheLittleSongbird,6," Love/hate...
","The Bodyguard is an example of a movie that isn't for everyone. I personally didn't either love it or hate it, I was overall kind of eh on it. The dialogue is cheesy, the characters underdeveloped and lacking subtlety, the pace drags in the middle and the story makes little sense. However we do have some good cinematography, locations, costumes and editing, credible direction and a great soundtrack including the haunting And I Will Always Love You(and it will always be the best version no matter how many Huston wannabes try to sing it and end up murdering it). The acting is fine, Kevin Costner is good and Whitney Huston is more than credible in a role that showcases her beautiful voice excellently. Overall, The Bodyguard is a love or hate it sort of movie, but for me my reaction was mixed. 6/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2568136/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2010,namashi_1,8," Simply Superb... A Classic!
","Mick Jackson's 'The Bodyguard' is a film that has a routine story about a Secret Service Agent turned bodyguard who is hired to protect a music icon, from an unknown stalker. Depsite zero novelty, I loved the film. It holds appeal from start to end, it keeps you interested even when the story isn't really moving. In short, a winner all the way!

2 May 2020,LeonardKniffel,6," Worth It Just for the Singing
","Whitney Houston became a movie star in this film, which offers a lot of insight into the level of talent and appeal she had some 20 years before her untimely death in 2012. Although this is not a musical per se (more of a romantic thriller), Houston plays a pop singer and performs, among other songs, her signature tune, ""I Will Always Love You,"" which was written by country legend Dolly Parton. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013",/review/rw2568136/?ref_=tt_urv
