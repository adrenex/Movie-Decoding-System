21 September 2018,cricketbat,10," This isn't just a love story, it's a life story.
","Every now and then, a film comes along that changes the way I think about life. About Time is that kind of movie. This pleasantly unique film isn't just a love story, it's a life story. It showcases a variety of relationships that go beyond the traditional rom-com stereotypes. The story is uplifting, the acting is excellent and the humor is plentiful. This movie made me want to be a better person, and I'm very glad I saw it.",/review/rw5752040/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2021,Kirpianuscus,," I love it !
","I am not a fan of romance movies. From childhood, I was fascinated by the idea/ posibility/ opportunity of time travel. But this splenid film is more about time travels and love. It is a gorgeous film about family. And it has the best actors ever. It is a film so useful than its seeds grows up , for long time, in the viewer memories and new attitude about life and the others. And that makes it just a great film. For humor, tension, honesty, for the relation father - son, touching in profound senses, for the lovely relation brother - sister, for admirable portrait of small aspects of the every day existence, for dialogues and, sure, for something nameless because you only feel. Short, great at whole.",/review/rw5752040/?ref_=tt_urv

21 September 2013,YJLcool,8," a witty, intelligent, charming, sweet film with surprising depth and heart
","From the director of 'Love Actually', who is also the writer of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', 'Bean', 'Notting Hill' and the 'Bridget Jones' films, it sure raises some expectations for this particular fantasy romantic comedy drama film about time travel. ",/review/rw5752040/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2013,cinematic_aficionado,," an unexpected delight
","A young man, like many others. Only he can travel in time. This main element of the plot, is something that was difficult to digest throughout the film, since it was not a predominantly sci-fi movie. This struggle was compensated by the successful interjection that even with such ability, life can have difficulties.",/review/rw5752040/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2014,kosmasp,7," Simple yet effective
","One thing you have to do, if you decide watching this: Do not care about inconsistencies. Or trying to make sense of it. There is more wrong with the internal logic that you will be able to stomach (if you go down that road). Of course the actors are able to distract you most of the time (really nice work done there), but there will be times where you're just going to go: Really? ",/review/rw5752040/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2013,roger-pettit1,10," One of the very best films I have ever seen
","Initial impressions of a book, film, play, piece of music etc. can sometimes be ill-considered. I have occasionally revised my opinion of such a work with the passage of time. I am confident, however, that I shall not change my view on ""About Time"", the sheer brilliance of which has quite bowled me over. It's not only one of the very best films I have seen recently. It's one of the best I have ever seen. Yes, I think it's that good.",/review/rw5752040/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2013,Horst_In_Translation,10," Deeply moving film with a message
","When I went into this movie, all I knew was that it has Rachel McAdams, Brendan Gleeson's son (who I knew from Harry Potter and Six Shooter) and time travel. As I'm usually not the greatest sci-fi fan, my expectations weren't too high I guess. When I left the theater 120 minutes later I was wowed by what I just witnessed. I really liked the way they split this film basically into two halves. The first is mostly romantic comedy. The main premise is initially rather odd as the lead character finds out from his dad that he has the ability to travel in time. And so he does for a while to correct certain mishaps that happened to him, mostly love-related ones and here and there also a favor to a friend. I won't go into detail what he decided to relive particularly, but it was all quite entertaining and never really dragged. How he needs to run away to make it happen, was always one of my favorite parts. McAdams is always nice to watch and she gives a solid performance here too. I read Zooey Deschanel was also an option for the part and I don't really like her, so I'm actually glad they went with McAdams, who has unusually dark hair here. There is also one particularly sweet sequence when he finally has a chance to get with the woman of his dreams and realizes she's not the one he wants, but McAdams' character is. Up to halfway into the film I'd maybe rate it a 7/10.",/review/rw5752040/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2019,mrcolorblind,10," Happiness
","So, I don't like romance movies. And it's not because I don't like love stories, it's because I think most romance movies are kinda shallow. Love is a great thing, but, usually, a regular love story, isn't enough for me to enjoy a movie.",/review/rw5752040/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2019,llhorton,9," If you think this is only a love story about a boy and a girl, you're wrong
","I'm older now but this movie still gets me. It's a wonderful love story about boy meets girl but the real story is the love between dad and son. Superbly acted by all involved and with a stellar soundtrack, you can watch it ten times and be touched by the story every time. I can't recommend it enough for those days when real life is so negative.",/review/rw5752040/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2013,The_moan_of_all_moans,7," Charming.
","Really surprised by this one;was expecting the run of the mill rom-com, but it is so much more than that; it's about family and the smiles and cries of life. The whole film was filled with charm, wit and had its fair share of heartfelt moments. Time travel is a subject that has been visited many times in the film industry, but this had its own unique touch to it. ",/review/rw5752040/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2014,tukamark,10," Extraordinary movie.
","What an amazing movie. When I see the cast and the title, I immediately thought of a romantic clichÃ©, with full of known plot twists, and et cetera. Rachel McAdams is known for her romantic movies, but this was just more and more than that.",/review/rw5752040/?ref_=tt_urv

","No matter how many times you jump around in time...From your perspective anything that happened before ""that"" moment is in your past..even if it happens to occur in the future of the world. So if you go back in time and stop your kids from being born..that happened in your past even if your kids are not born until the future happens. So the main Character's past is at times, located in the future.. So it lets you undo any big mistakes. ",/review/rw5752040/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2013,james-67-118290,10," How can people slate this movie???
","I just don't understand how people are not liking this film. It is just perfect!!! Any Richard Curtis movie I rate against Love actually, because to me that is his best film and one of my all time favourites! But About Time for me beats love actually hands down. The film is so well thought out and the cast is just so good! I have seen this movie twice already as it was such a great story. The main focus of the film is about love and family so don't be too worried about the travelling in time, it fits into the film so well and makes some great comic moments when things go wrong. Don't listen to the haters, this really is a fabulous movie! It is a sad thought though that this could be Richard's last film he is going to direct, I hope not, but if it is, what a way to end his brilliant films! ",/review/rw5752040/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2018,slewofcigars,10," Very sweet
","Obviously very far fetched, however the plot is very charming. The harmony of the characters is infectious. One of my favorite romantic themed movies ever. I love Tim (Gleeson) and Mary (McAdams) as a couple and cheer for them the whole way through.
Fantastic score, and the supporting cast is stellar.
It's a sap fest, so make sure your glucose levels are on par before watching. ðŸ˜Š",/review/rw5752040/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2014,Zenerat,10," Soul Food
","Another reviewer wrote a wonderful review about this film but classified this movie as a dessert, I would respectfully disagree. I may have been in just the right frame of mind or seen it on the right day but to me this movie was exactly what I needed, and it is indeed soul food. I don't really feel the need to describe the plot the trailer does that well enough and the fact that I think it is a good move can be seen in my rating.",/review/rw5752040/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2016,studioAT,10," An excellent film

3 December 2018,just-woot,10," About a love story
","Of course we all (perhaps all...) wish there was a way to go back and change something in our lives. Or another's. This movie touches lightly on the paradox of time travel for the traveler's sake. Consequences. Yes, others have attempted this ... i.e., The Butterfly Effect, et al. About Time adds a sweet spin on the concept. I loved my own father and my own brother dearly, and have lost them both, way too soon, years ago. What I would give to go back and change one thing in their lives that would have perhaps gotten them through that fateful day.",/review/rw5752040/?ref_=tt_urv
