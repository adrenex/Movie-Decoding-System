4 April 2017,ReganRebecca,8," Big Little Show
","This really is the golden age of TV as proved by the fact that this mini-series stars three incredible actresses (two of them Oscar winners) giving some of their career best performances). Big Little Lies takes a hard look at the lives of women in the wealthy mostly white suburb of Monterey, where you're no one if you don't have a beach front property and where everyone hides their secrets so that they don't risk anyone seeing that their lives are a facade.

20 February 2017,DukeEman,9," Very creative with a sinister wit and some intelligence...
","I almost gave up on it after the lacklustre and uncreative beginning, but then the clever structure and intricate story-line kicked-in, followed by the interesting characters who are slowly taking form. Their purpose and meaning to the unfolding mystery is becoming evident and damn fascinating. All thanks to the performers who have already got this perfectly down-pat in the first episode, and that allows the story to take shape and meaning for the remainder of the series.",/review/rw3697007/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2017,lee_eisenberg,8," there's something wrong with our lives
","The main thing that I took from ""Big Little Lies"" is that we lead screwed-up existences. The protagonists have what look like the ideal lives, but it becomes clear that something is amiss. Whether it's a lack of fulfillment or something worse, all three are living a lie. The story gets told as a series of interviews to let the viewer know that the action is building up to something big.",/review/rw3697007/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2018,korereviews,9," Big payoff at the end
","Like a lot of viewers, there were moments when I thought I'd had enough of this show: bitchy rich women who never seem to notice how privileged they all are - for the first few episodes, you just want them all to die. But there is always something to keep you just intrigued enough to watch another episode. And then you start to see what's really going on behind the scenes of their perfect lives, and it all starts to make sense. You realize that that feeling of annoyance at all the characters was actually a clever ploy: you're meant to hate them all at the start. But by the end, you actually really like them all, and that's some clever writing, I must say. Trust me, the last few episodes fly by, and the ending is everything you'd want it to be. Clever, genuinely touching, and very satisfying without ever feeling predictable. This is a well-crafted and very well told story. Plus the cinematography and music are hypnotically beautiful. Definitely worth your time.",/review/rw3697007/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2017,mrocco-1,10," Wow, just wow!
","I have HBO and NEVER watch it. I'm not a big fan of what apparently many other people like to watch. But when I saw the commercial for this I was intrigued. I never heard of the book, but highly respect many of the lead actors so I figured if they were involved it couldn't totally suck. Speaking of suck, I was completely sucked in on the first episode. I don't know why but I found this show completely and utterly mesmerizing, all the way down to the music and cinematography. Everyone involved in this from top to bottom hit it out of the park. I've never experienced this kind of life-style (ie mommy, daddy and school politics) but one of my clients who watches the show and lives in the general area said they nailed her experience when her kids were in school.

9 April 2017,gradyharp,10," The wonder and brilliance of a female acting ensemble
","The wonder of brilliance of a female acting ensemble David E Kelley, in adapting Liane Moriarty's novel). Has written another stunning series - a seven episode series for television that among other attributes pulls together four of our most brilliant contemporary actresses in a story that is one of the better explorations and defenses of feminism. Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Shailene Woodley and Laura Dern remind us of how powerful artists can create both a polished performance and a raw statement about the feminine side of living, especially under the very keen direction of Jean-Marc Vallée.",/review/rw3697007/?ref_=tt_urv

","Exquisite. 'Big Little Lies' takes us to an incredible journey with its emotional and intriguing storyline. The characters are so thoroughly and thoughtfully developed. Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley, Laura Dern gave breathtaking performances. Directing, screenplay, photography, everything is brilliantly done.

","Haven't been so caught up and involved in a series for a long time. It grips you from episode 1 and will keep you enthralled till the nail biting party - the most exciting party I've ever seen on TV. This is not just a more edgy Desperate Housewives, it's in another class. ",/review/rw3697007/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2017,padawanmovies,8," Wowza!
","HBO is probably one of my favorite networks, Sunday is one of the best nites of TV in my opinion (GoT, VEEP, Silicon Valley). I saw a few previews of this show and didn't think much of it. Boy was I mistaken! I'm a fan of Whitherspoon, Skaarsgard, and a few other of the actors. Prior to this I wasn't a fan of Kidman(changed my mind after seeing To Die For for the 1st time recently, one of the best roles of her career) and my verdict's still out on Kravitz & Woodley but again I have to say everyone brought there A game to this project... I really enjoy the premise of ""everyone has baggage & problems"" regardless of social status or $. My few critiques of the show would be the pace of the finale, Laura Dern's angry white woman thing was a little annoying but she did a good job, what the heck did Jane do to afford a decent looking house & car on a part time income, and y did Whitherspoon's 6 yr old have the musical library and attitude of someone ten times her age?? Other than those minute criticisms again I gotta say this is a show worth watching with a final twists that blew my socks off! ANOTHER GREAT ONE HBO",/review/rw3697007/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2017,Nightmarelogic,9," Amazing show about women
",I don't usually like HBO shows. I am one of the few people who doesn't care for Game of Thrones. However I found this HBO short series incredibly compelling. Nichole Kidman in breathtaking playing an abused wife. Some of the best scenes of the show are when her character Celeste is talking to the psychiatrist who bluntly removes the vale of naivety from her eyes. Also giving incredible performances are Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern playing very similar women who took very different paths snipping at each other for minor trivialities. Finally there is Shailene Woodley who plays the young single mother who arrives in town which sets off a string of events that forces her to defend a son she isn't sure is innocent and confront her own dark past.,/review/rw3697007/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2017,Reno-Rangan,," A BIG mystery surrounding LITTLE kids and their LIES.
","I neither read the book nor I knew the story. So this was a surprise mini-series. As far I've heard, this one was the finest adaptation. The best ever cast and the episodes were well split with each one had a great opening and the ending. The suspense kept me alive till the final episode, final scene. Meanwhile, I made some guesses, but most of them did not happen. In my opinion, it should have been a feature film duology. Then it would have been considered one of the best film series, as well as mystery film. And the Oscars, Golden Globes would have poured in. Now it got record 14 Emmy nods and I'm waiting for the result.",/review/rw3697007/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was an an excellent show, I don't normally watch this type of show (except Desperate Housewives back in the day) but with this type of wit I can't put it down. I kept watching the whole series within one weekend, it was very addictive. If you like to watch a well written satirical view on the lies underneath the seemingly picture perfect lives in Suburbia, like in American Beauty and Desperate Housewives, you just may like this.

","What attracted me to this TV series was the cast, however even after watching the first episode i was fascinated by its soundtrack. I feel lucky to discover some great piece of music. The acting was also impressive as one can guess. I would highly recommend it, you won't regret it :)",/review/rw3697007/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2020,planktonrules,10," The acting is simply brilliant...and you cannot top watching.
","I must warn you a bit about ""Big Little Lies"". This HBO series is very violent, with vivid depictions of domestic violence. It also has a lot of nudity. In addition, the show is one that EASILY could overwhelm viewers...especially those who have been through domestic violence and rape. A tough show....but an amazing one. So, if you're inviting over Father O'Malley or your mother, you might just want to think twice about seeing this one with them.",/review/rw3697007/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2017,lisajoy1960,10," Just Watch It - It's The Show You've Been Waiting For...
","HBO's new limited series, Big Little Lies, is simply outstanding in every way. The casting is perfect - Reese Witherspoon as Madeline, Shailene Woodley as Jane and the always fabulous Nicole Kidman as Celeste - three very different mothers residing in the ultra wealthy enclave of Monterey, California. The show also focuses on Renata (a tense, edgy performance by Laura Dern and the families of the four main characters. James Tupper, Adam Scott, James Nordling turn in great performances, but Alexander Skaarsgard really shines as Perry, Celeste's troubled, volatile husband. ",/review/rw3697007/?ref_=tt_urv

","Big Little Lies has a stellar cast in domestic drama mainly about affluent parents living in ultra wealthy and liberal Monterey, Ca. Yet it plays out in seven episodes a bit like the old and much longer Twin Peaks series...beginning with a possible murder. So if you don't have the time you just have to see the first episode and the last one to see who did it and you really won't miss much.",/review/rw3697007/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2017,KathleenK22,10," Beautiful views, magnificent acting and intriguing story
",The view was the first thing that captured me. Reece Witherspoon's acting was the next to wow me. The characters are not one dimensional but complicated and unfolding as each episode progresses. I have watched three now so think I have a good handle on why this show is attracting such good scores. Issues such as marriage and relationships are depicted and they are not always innocent or good. Who has been murdered? It is fun guessing! Families are also complicated and parents struggle with children whether they are small or teenagers. The topics and themes are ones that everyone can relate to. There is not one example of poor acting! If you like mysteries this one is for you but also for people who like romances or breathtaking scenery and well acted stories. Everything is not spelled out for you which is refreshing from an American production. Later....after watching the whole series....loved this show! Female power wins the day! That is what I took away from this show. It contained surprises and twists to satisfy the viewer. It built the tension gradually each episode and I was waiting each week to see where it was taking me. The characters were amazing and the storyline was gripping! When women support and care for each other life is good.,/review/rw3697007/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2017,bjarias,10," ...not to get ahead of ourselves.. but this could be very, very good..
",".. it's only one episode in, but it has all the makings of a really great series.. irregardless of all the big names involved on the acting side (and there are quite a few).. the writing and script is so strong that you loose sight of all their very familiar faces.. when scripts are weak then you're looking at the actors and all you get caught up in are the Hollywood personalities.. this one is different, and it's a credit to all involved.. it's sooo early and anything can happen but it feels as if it has the potential to be one the more outstanding TV series productions in quite some time.. keeping them all together for multiple seasons not an issue right now, but you've already got to be thinking (as the plot is clear).. who's first to go.. Have now watched all seven episodes... In June Nicole Kidman will be fifty years old... and one of the most gorgeous half-century old women on the planet.. (and one of the best actors). In this production she is just absolutely amazing, and I'm looking forward to watching it all again sometime. If you are only going to be doing one season.. this production is a benchmark. There are no flaws.. every detail down to the background music is exemplary..(and all the children are incredible). The leads were executive producers and they should most definitely reunite their production companies again very soon.. if they have not already. Don't even think about passing on this outstanding miniseries.. you'll be highly rewarded.",/review/rw3697007/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2017,Alexander_Blanchett,9," Oh those desperate, desperate housewives
","What a blast. I treat this film like a feature film, which is the way director Jean-Marc Vallée shot it anyway. This is one of the best ""Films"" to explore he superficial rich community housewives / moms in a very deep and honest way. It gives them a certain background. All this mixed with a nice murder mystery which is kind of original because you do not only not know who is the murderer but also you don't know who is the victim until the very last act. While that final twist becomes more and more obvious during the course of the ""film"" it still leaves you with a certain satisfaction. The acting is tremendous. And if that truly would be a feature film it would be a frontrunner for next years Oscars. Reese Witherspoon gives the performance of her career. I have never been a fan of her but after this I very well could become one. She did some great work on ""Wild"" and some reasonably good jobs in ""Election"", ""Walk the Line"" and even ""Legally Blonde"" but what she did here tops everything she did before. And she was so perfect for that role. The rest of the cast stands out as well. Nicole Kidman was tremendous and really adopts her character in such a smooth way. Shailene Woodley stands out once again and has many scene stealing moments. Laura Dern was good, although overacted at times but just like Witherspoon she was born to play that role. I loved Zoe Kravitz and Adam Scott was convincing in a for him unusual role. Alexander Skarsgard had his moments as well and from the kids Iain Armitage really delivers in a for a child difficult role. Fantastic soundtrack and many nice little twists in-between. Highly recommend it to watch all 7 episodes in a row if you got the time.",/review/rw3697007/?ref_=tt_urv
