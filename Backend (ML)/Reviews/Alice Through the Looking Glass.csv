11 April 2017,Gordon-11,," A super powerful film that depresses deeply
","This film tells the story of a woman who cannot speak many years ago in a small town in the United States of America. She endures the many horrors that life has put her through, and it all started because of a priest.",/review/rw5128878/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2017,dpbertrand-126-427929,7," As dark as it gets
","I have read a few reviews regarding this movie and all of them have said it's dark, violent and not for the faint of heart. Those definitions are fine, however I still do not think this is enough to describe the tone of the movie. I would describe it as ruthless and depressing. This does not mean I didn't enjoy it, as you can tell by my rating, however the point of a review is to warn a potential viewer of what they are getting themselves into and this movie is as dark as I have seen. It is unlike any western that I have ever seen as it is not traditional. It's so unique that I would have given this a bit of a higher rating if it wasn't so hard to watch. I do not want to ruin any of the plot as it made the movie more interesting for me just based on what I had seen in the trailers. I can see why it was set in the western time period due to the realism of the material. A movie like this set in our times would have been impossible to make, and if they did it would not have been executed as well as this. The acting was quite impressive. It truly feels like each actor really threw themselves in their roles, which is incredible for some as there are some twisted characters in this film. Which brings me to Guy Pearce who played the role of 'The Reverend'. He plays such an awful man that I have no idea how he would have been able to shake this off after filming was completed. I cannot remember the last time I hated a character as much as a despised him. Dakota Fanning was also amazing in her role. She was convincing from start to finish with many different emotions throughout the movie. She also needed to use facial expressions more than dialogue in the movie, which cannot not be an easy task to complete, but she nailed it! When I had first seen the length of the movie I was concerned it would have major passing issues, it did not. The story grabs you from the beginning to the end, I couldn't stop watching. I had no idea how it would end and could not wait to find out. The most impressive part is it really did not have a lot of action, just characters that grabbed your attention whether good or bad. It was well written. So if you are not of the faint of heart and can handle a very dark, ruthless, depressing story that is still entertaining from start to finish see this movie, you won't regret it.",/review/rw5128878/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2018,claudio_carvalho,7," How Might Be the Heart of Someone that Writes Such a Story?
","""Brimstone"" is one film that arises emotion and stays in the viewer. The long and realistic story is one of the gloomiest, most depressing, cruel and unfair without redemption ever written. However, let me make clear that the film is excellent and the viewer shall not give up watching in the beginning. The screenplay divided in four parts - Revelation, Exodus, Genesis and Retribution - is perfect, disclosing the non-chronological saga of the protagonist Liz / Joanna. The cast is magnificent, with Guy Pearce representing the personification of evil and Dakota Fanning difficult to be recognized in the role of a ""cursed"" woman, supported by Carice van Houten and Kit Harington. The locations, costumes and cinematography are top notch and the haunting music score is also magnificent. The only question that remains is how might be the heart of someone that writes such a story? My vote is seven.",/review/rw5128878/?ref_=tt_urv

15 April 2017,brchthethird,8," A brutal and harrowing Western
","Brutal. Harrowing. Unforgiving. Just a few words that come to mind that succinctly describe the experience of watching BRIMSTONE. If you like/don't mind the unsavory and uncompromising in your entertainment you'll probably enjoy this. If you like languidly paced art films, then you'll probably enjoy this. Otherwise, you might lose your patience. The narrative unfolds slowly and methodically, but the payoff is mostly worth the time taken to get there. Aiming to keep this spoiler-free, a brief synopsis is that a new minister (Guy Pearce) comes to a small Western town, and this puts a mute woman (Dakota Fanning) on edge, especially after a miscarriage puts her at odds with her fellow townsfolk. One further important detail is that the film is divided into four chapters, and the first three of these unfold in reverse chronological order. The movie centers around Dakota Fanning and Guy Pearce's characters, and the narrative structure allowed the director to withhold key information until the right time. Of course, like many other films with unique narrative devices, remove it and the film wouldn't be nearly as effective. That being said, there's plenty of stuff that goes on in nearly two and a half hours. A little indulgent? Sure, but all of the narrative elements are good enough to not make this much of a deal-breaker. I will say that the pacing, though slow, was steady and I never got bored. Thematically, Martin Koolhoven (the director) was able to use the period setting effectively to portray a world of religious coercion and the lengths men will go to justify oppressing women. Guy Pearce's character was basically evil incarnate, and it was a scarily brilliant performance. Dakota Fanning also did well, certainly better than I've seen out of her before. Kit Harrington also had a small role as a man that Dakota Fanning's character secretly nurses back to health, and who also teaches her a valuable lesson. From the more technical side, I greatly enjoyed the beautiful cinematography, and the haunting score by Tom Holkenborg (aka, JunkieXL). All things considered, this is one of the best films I've seen in a while, Western or not. For some reason, Europeans seem to do a better job nowadays tackling this genre, and BRIMSTONE is no exception. As long as you're a somewhat patient viewer, and not easily offended, I can highly recommend this.",/review/rw5128878/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2020,mreuvers,," Life can be like this
","It is interesting to see the shear amount of negative reviews here, while I think this movie portrays a very realistic scenario in a lawless US at that time. It still portrays a realistic scenario in some parts of the world today. Its unrelenting violence and utter hopelessness reminds me a lot of a famous novel by Kosinski: the painted bird.",/review/rw5128878/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2022,fernandoschiavi,7," Brimstone is an interesting suspense thriller, a tale about survival and an ode to resistance made by an unusual female protagonist who refuses to have her will subjugated
","The narrative is divided into four non-linear acts - three of them named after the titles of books of the Scriptures - that accompany the trajectory of violence that umbilical unites the lives of its two protagonists. Portraying, it can be said, his own conception of what hell would be, the Dutch director exposes a film with beautiful photography, beautiful performances and interesting narrative, although it lacks a bit of the metaphorical pretension that his script tries to convey.",/review/rw5128878/?ref_=tt_urv

","My advice is don't watch this before bed because you probably won't sleep, but if you do sleep, expect nightmares! You think I'm joking, I'm not!!

16 April 2017,deloudelouvain,8," Dark but good
","It's been a long time since I didn't watched a good western like this one. Not the typical cowboys versus Indians western but more a thriller drama from that period. I think it shows good how badly women were treated in that time. Not that everybody was like that but I can perfectly well imagine that the opinion of women didn't really matter in those hard days. The story is well written, with the right amount of suspense, but is sometimes hard to watch. Some scenes are very degrading for women. Guy Pearce does a perfect job playing The Reverend. He's a disgusting character and you wish the worst happens to him, but that's also due to the good acting skills from Guy Pearce. Dakota Fanning did also a perfect job as well as the young Emilia Jones both playing the young and older Liz/Joanna. The soundtrack adds something special to the already dark ambiance of the movie. The surroundings and nature shots are perfect for the movie. Even though it's not shot anywhere near the movie is supposed to be it certainly looks like that.",/review/rw5128878/?ref_=tt_urv

9 June 2018,areatw,6," Gripping storyline makes this truly miserable film worthwhile
","It's impossible for anybody to say that they 'enjoyed' this film, because there's nothing at all to enjoy. It's a dark, bleak and utterly depressing film from the first scene to the last. What makes 'Brimstone' worth watching is its gripping storyline, first rate cinematography and fascinating bunch of character. It has the feel of a high end, expensive production and is difficult to fault in a technical sense.",/review/rw5128878/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2018,classicsoncall,9," ""If you don't obey the rules, you're guilty. And if you're guilty, you're gonna pay.""
","Told in a series of flashback narratives before returning to the present day of the story. ""Brimstone"" is a harrowing look at the life of a woman on the run from her past but irrevocably forced to confront the man who destroyed her successive families. One would be hard pressed to encounter a more despicable villain in cinema than the character of The Reverend (Guy Pearce), who's interpretation of the Bible goes only one way, and that's to his evil advantage. He is so sinister in fact, that he knows his immortal soul is eventually doomed, yet pursues his mission of hate filled revenge against a daughter who had the temerity to stand up for herself.

23 January 2022,jdring2007,8," disturbingly powerful performance by Guy Pearce and company, with taut direction and Tarantino-ish storytelling, but gloomy and sometimes overbearing
","Recommending this film to someone feels like a sin in itself. Want to have a good time not having a good time? Dive in. It's a movie that features nonlinear storytelling, which feels a bit puzzling sometimes but in the end makes it even more effective. The length is undeniable and you will feel it, especially given some drawn out scenes of just monotonous music and nothing happening, probably as a means of building tension, but there's enough of that already. The acting is superb beginning to end, even from smaller characters such as the one played by Jack Roth. Besides what I would call Guy Pearce's best performance in the last decade, I thought Emilia Jones was exceptional, and unexpected. Dakota Fanning was great, too, but her role was mostly mute. To say that I ""enjoyed"" this movie would be a paradox, given the weight of the material, and how unnerving it was to experience. Nonetheless, the chills I felt at the end and the conclusion of it all was inarguably effective. For anyone who expects a typical western drama, I advise watching the trailer; because there's nothing typical about it, and that is what makes it great.",/review/rw5128878/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2017,pronins,1," Wow... Ridiculous
","I really don't write many reviews but, having just watched Brimstone, I couldn't help it... Let me just say that I'm a big horror fan and have absolutely no problem with violence or gore in movies, even if used only for shock value, IF it's done right. This of course is not a horror film by any means. It's a wannabe thriller with no point, no message and, worst of all, the director is trying to make you believe it has the depth of a Tarkovsky film. It makes no sense in terms of character development - the main female character, who has witnessed and also committed horrible acts of violence, who has been tortured by her deranged perverted father, who had the guts to cut her own tongue out at one point just to be able to fake her identity, suddenly becomes a scared little bunny when the main villain who had destroyed her life finds her again and wants to keep tormenting her... She takes no action whatsoever which, by this point in her story would be highly unlikely... She doesn't even warn her family that the new reverand is basically the boogie man. I mean, the guy survived getting his throat slit wide open, entered the house somehow (while the female protagonist was guarding the only door) and murdered her father in law in complete silence, than magically appeared in front of her, then kept it cool and motionless and even remained talkative while being lit on fire... If this was supposed to be a supernatural thriller, it certainly wasn't convincing, since this super villain died way too quickly in the end. All of the violence is mostly against women, and the end didn't feel redeeming at all - hardly any retribution really... So many bs religious references, attempts at survival genre, elements of horror, thriller, western, drama, 12,000,000 budget - all for nothing. If some violent movies such as Hostel or The Human Centipede at least offer shallow entertainment due to the dark humor, this movie takes itself so seriously that even the supposedly ""shocking"" violence leaves no impression. I'm not even going to get into script flaws (for example how the reverand decides to rent the whole bordello for some reason so that nobody catches him doing it (also in another town) then just happens to instead stumble upon his daughter that just happens to now work in that particular town at that bordello, and it all happens precisely on the very last day before she is supposed to run away... I mean, my god... etc......) Don't watch this film - not because it's violent, iconoclastic or upsetting (they just want you to find it controversial, it's really none of these things). It's just a boring, predictable, pretentious film that has no point and is absolutely empty in every way.",/review/rw5128878/?ref_=tt_urv

So, why create such a useless film? to disgust us? to show us to what level of stupidity the writer can get?

13 March 2017,AudioFileZ,7," A Unique Horror Western Combination With The DeFacto Morality Theme
",Brimstone plays as a 4-act western with heavy elements of a lawless and immoral time elevated to the brink of a horror movie. In other words it's 100% dark. It certainly has deep themes one can decipher differently and wrapped in mystery which the two middle acts slowly unfold like nested Faberge eggs of what it is about.,/review/rw5128878/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is, first of all, consistent with Hollywood demonizing Christianity. I'm not even a practicing Christian, but I see it in blazing colors in this film. The extreme portrayal by Guy Pearce, whom I love as an actor, is laughable in this role, were it not so horrible in misogyny, sexual perversion, incest...the list goes on. This film is pure schlock.
