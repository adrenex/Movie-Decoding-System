18 August 2018,mattcurtis-50459,9," When I was 12 years old I would have loved this movie...
","...now I'm 45 and guess what?
From ET and The Gonnies to Harry Potter and Stranger Things I've enjoyed this genre of Sci-Fi/fantasy TV and movies. Nothing warms my heart more than the riteouus innocence of youth vs the cruelty and bitterness of ""grown ups"". Likely another serial, in the same vein of Hunger Games or Maze Runner but hey, why not? Sure give this a score of 5 if you want then complain it's not original enough or the acting isn't worthy of an Oscar! -or- Like me, smile and be thankful that someone's still making movies like this, movies that remind us of what it's like to be a kid. A kid, who dreams of special powers and a future were we get to be boss for a change! It's far too easy to pour scorn and cynicism here but I don't see you detractors doing any better. It's a solid 9 out of10 for me. Keep up the good work.",/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2018,mtjohnson-18549,7," Entertaining movie
","After reading some of the 1 star reviews I began to wonder if we were watching the same movie or if they even watched this movie at all. The movie does have a plot, decent cinematography and the acting is decent. I did not read the book but I enjoyed this movie although I wasn't the target audience. Judge it for yourself and don't allow others to guide your opinion either way.",/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2018,Platypuschow,5," The Darkest Minds: Another doomed franchise
","The Darkest Minds is the latest teen sci-fi franchise alike Hunger Games, Divergent, Twilight, The Host etc etc etc and alike the majority of them will never be a fully told story.",/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2018,yuan_yuan3,7," This film is actually quite good!
","I am not sure why people are giving 1 to this film, there are plenty films deserve a 1 than this one. The trailer is pretty in line with the film. Believable characters and the actors gave a pretty good performances. Overall I enjoyed it very much. If you like hunger games, this is similar. I would definitely recommend this film to others! I hope there are sequels coming!",/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2019,dfranzen70,5," You have already seen this movie.
","The book is probably better. This YA story is derivative and generic, and it manages to telegraph who the baddie is much earlier than it means to. Amandla Stenberg is pretty good as star Ruby (she also played Rue in the Hunger Games), but the movie feels more like a cheapie you'd find on ABC Family Channel.",/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2018,TheLittleSongbird,5," Futuristic control
","Have not read the source material (have heard a lot of good things about it though), but did love the idea of the film, have nothing against dystopian books/films and there were watchable actors involved, love Gwendoline Christie in 'Game of Thrones' for example. Will admit about not being sure about seeing it, with not so good word of mouth from friends. ",/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2018,peterp-450-298716,2," An uninspired and mediocre dystopian teen movie. Shrug.

",I think they did a pretty good job. Sure it wasn't revolutionary good or didn't show anything we haven't seen but it was good on it's own. And They made me want more.,/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2018,neil-476,7," I have questions but no answers...
","A plague kills the majority of the world's children. Those who survive have various paranormal abilities, and are graded by the government from Green (the majority, with simple, safe powers) up through the colours to Orange (rare, and so dangerous that they are to be killed on identification). 10 year old Orange Ruby survives by pretending to be Green inside one of the the prison camps which house all children. When the authorities finally realise the truth, Ruby escapes and enters one of the underground factions.",/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv

","In an unspecified year in the future, 98% of American kids were wiped out by a mysterious disease called Idiopathic Adolescent Acute Neurodegeneration (or IAAN). 10-year old Ruby Daly was one of the survivors. She and the other survivors of the plague were gathered up by the government and put them in a camp. ",/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2018,PennyReviews,7," Good Enough
","The darkest minds is an adaption from a popular fantasy book that follows the themes of dystopia that Divergent and The Hunger Games-Battle Royal, have set. There are too many movies with the same theme : youngsters with special powers try to fight the government who is aiming to use them as weapons. So, if you like these kind of movies, then you're going to like this one as well. I haven't read the book, so I don't know if this adaption does justice to it, but overall, it was well made and the CGI were great. The story was kind of interesting as well, though things happened quickly so the story has a fast pace. The performances were good too. So, I can't say if this one is a memorable movie, but it was enjoyable and entertaining enough.",/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2021,kosmasp,7," Mind over matter
","Science Fiction ... now if it is based in reality or something we may consider or think may happen. Might work for some and not for others. Now there is quite the stretch some may have to do, but if you can accept that people are able to use their mind for more than just thinking ... But even if you don't accept it, just suspend your disbelief and you'll be rewarded with quite the interesting concept and movie.",/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2018,santiagomace,7," What's up with the bad reviews?
","I mean, no, it doesn't really bring anything new to the table. But by itself, it's a pretty decent movie with nice special effects and a beautiful score by Benjamin Wallfisch",/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv

19 August 2018,jordan-paige-45516,10," LOVED this film!
","To be honest, I am not sure why lots of people dislike this film. However, I can personally say that I enjoyed this film immensely. Being a fan of the book series, I was already excited for the film's release, but was nervous about the YA novel adaptation. However, I feel that while the book and film are different in many ways (as they have to be, as there are things in the novel that can't be done easily on screen), the production team did a wonderful job of making the film their own, but sticking to the novel very well. Although it seemed fast paced at times, I was eager to see what would happen next. My mom, who has never read the series, left the theater and said ""well, now I'm going to have to steal the second book from you and read it, because I can't wait until another movie to see what happens!""
Please, do not listen to the negative reviews, and go see this film for yourself. I had the incredible opportunity to be a background extra on the set of the film, and saw firsthand how hard both the cast and crew worked to bring this film to life. Please go support to not only see an incredible storyline come to life, but to encourage future YA novel adaptations, female directors, and inclusive/diverse casting.",/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2018,JessaKat18,," Shocked at the low reviews!
",WOW! I am actually really shocked at the low reviews on this movie. I seriously thought i would see higher ratings. Well I am not from the cast as one of the other reviewers seems to believe all the high ratings are from the cast of the movie LMAO. I loved this movie I am pretty excited for the next part! It kept my attention the whole way through and I really thought the story was great. It kind of reminds me of like Divergent series but obviously not exactly the same. I say if you didnt mind those movies you wont mind this one at all.,/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2019,chrisdillon33,3," needs a tv series to tell the full story
","This is a good story but considering it is based on a book a television series would tell the story better and the other books in the series could be included,
A watchable movie with a good cast and an alright script, the only bad thing is the
developing the characters in the length of time the movie runs for does fall short it basically develops some of the characters not all and while the story is good it could have focused on more than just one character which it mainly does so in that sense it is in my opinion a 3 star rated film that needed a bit more in its script to give it that quality that you would be willing to watch it more than once.",/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2018,pidstr,8," Good First Episode
","Treat as Made-For-TV, rather then Cinema Release, easy equal of other 'teen saves the world' genre films.
Modern diversity in the cast of characters that play their parts well.
Only thing missing is a string of sequels.",/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2018,trollerbrendan,1," oh no.....
","I.....don't even know what to say it was just so bad. How this movie even got made from the script is beyond me. I would say ""Hmmm well maybe it looked good on paper"" but the dialogue was predictable and dry. I personally haven't read the book, maybe it's a good book, I don't know, but this movie just flat out sucks. I saw it with a group of 7 people and none of us liked it. I wish we had seen a better movie, I really do, because it was just so unbearable to watch. I recommend this movie to no one. I'm serious. It's that bad. Do not watch it. Come 5 months and it's on some streaming service, knock yourself out, but seriously do not pay to see this you will be as disappointed as I am.",/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2018,sbweightman,2," A boring and unoriginal young adult dystopian film that treads a heavily worn path.
","The premise is weak and the story is straightforward, although it does some world building for the inevitable sequel(s). The special effects are OK and the car chase / bonding scenes are fun, but there's little sense of threat, the villains are dull and cliché, and the romance is about as forced and predictable as it can get.",/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2018,Steve-Zoicks,5," X-men for teenagers mixed with hunger games
",If you ever wanted to see two movies at once then this the show for you. The powers of X-men with the group division of the hunger games. Are we ever going to find a movie that doesn't piggy back off another successful show.,/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2018,jonellefaulkner29,9," Very underrated
","I loved this film ... the story did have lots of scenes pinched from other films, but I didn't care..... the main characters were spot on and it was easy to be immersed into their world .... I love a film that makes you emotionally involved with the characters.... this film defiantly made me care about what happened ... totally underrated",/review/rw5832813/?ref_=tt_urv
