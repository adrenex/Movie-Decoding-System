29 September 2009,Rabh17,8," Lite, entertaining supernatural puzzler
","Now a lot of, I suspect, younger reviewers are slamming this show as a X-Files wanna-be. And other are unfairly comparing this one to ""Fringe"", which I LOVE BTW.",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2013,SanteeFats,6," Started out well
","I have watched this series from the pilot on. I really liked the first couple of seasons but things started to go south in my opinion after that. The plots got kind of weird with Arty using an artifact to bring s dead agent back to live and then he went bonkers for a few episodes, killing Lena, my favorite secondary character, until Claudia stabs him with another artifact thereby bringing him back from the precipice. Now that Arty has returned to the land of the living and things are more or less back to normal. I feel the series is losing its direction of the first couple of seasons. It was funny, interesting, and different than typical syfy shows. It still has a lot of the same stuff but I can't put my finger on it but I am not as enchanted with it as I was. I very much liked the addition of Claudia, she brings youth, humor and even sexy to the show, plus she is the tech guru that gives Arty the business from time to time. I will probably keep watching but this show is not the show I originally saw.",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2010,Zen416,9," A new favorite of mine
","SyFy (nee ""The SciFi Channel"") can usually be counted on to air some pretty interesting series; everything from humorous scifi light (Eureka for instance) to the darker, intense stuff (Battlestar Galactica and it's spin off, Caprica). I would definitely put ""Warehouse 13"" into the previous category rather than the latter. It's a cool quirky series that knows how to have fun with it's six primary, very different, series regulars. Saul Rubinek's Artie Nielsen, who acts as a sort of curator to the warehouse is the gruff, often exasperated anchor point to the rest of the crew and I have to admit: I wasn't crazy about his character at first but he really grew on me. He's kind of like that grouchy uncle you have that really has a heart of gold underneath. C. C. H. Pounder (as regent Mrs. Frederic) is one of those powerful actors who plays such a strong but subtle role brilliantly. Love seeing her on the little screen after such an amazing amount of varied roles on both the tube and the silver screen. The whole cast is a nice mish-mash of personalities that compliment one another but I have to admit a growing favorite of mine is Allison Scagliotti's ""Claudia Donovan"", who's funny, bright, endearing and occasionally flawed which makes her all the more likable. She winds up getting into some seriously funny messes that require the leads (an equally humorous Eddie McClintock and perfect straight-man Joanne Kelly as agents Lattimer and Bering) to bail her out. The weekly series always has some really cool artifact that belonged to some famous historical figure that wields some kind of science-bending power to it and the leads are tasked with retrieving said artifacts without getting themselves killed or some such other disaster. This show is good and it's getting better with every new episode (thanks to excellent writing) and it's definitely worth checking out if you're not already a fan.",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2010,tsruss,9," What a great show and suited to all ages
","What a great piece of work. Its just fun and entertaining - no in-depth stories, no deep meanings, nothing to do but watch and enjoy.",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2013,PlatoSays,7," What has happened to this once entertaining series?
","I've watched the entire run so far and after a good beginning, what has happened to it? By S4 mid-point, its turned into the most dreadful, ham-acted, soap opera where the artifact mysteries are largely overwhelmed by the childish acting - especially Pete who appears to have gone from being slightly immature macho man to an emotional 7yrs old. He reminds me a lot of Seeley Booth in Bones on a bad acting day.",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2015,dinalt10,5," Interesting concept that rapidly went downhill
","Was an interesting concept (albeit not wholly original), and started really strongly.",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2014,SnoopyStyle,7," Fun show with great chemistry
",Pete Lattimer (Eddie McClintock) and Myka Bering (Joanne Kelly) are a couple of agents from the US Secret Service. They get assigned by the mysterious Mrs Frederic (CCH Pounder) to a secret location in South Dakota. There is a warehouse run by Artie Nielsen (Saul Rubinek) filled with powerful supernatural objects. These artifacts are everywhere. Warehouse agents have gone out to retrieve and safely store them since ancient times. This is the 13th incarnation of the warehouse in a long line of warehouses. Claudia (Allison Scagliotti) is a girl whose life has always intersected with the warehouse.,/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2019,generationofswine,10," An Honest Review
","Like ""Eureka"" it's simply a fun science-fiction show, however this one with a sort of ""X-Files"" meets ""Friday the 13th the Series"" twist to it.",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2009,kmustain36,9," Pretty good show
","This show reminds me of the old ""Friday the Thirteenth"" television show, where two young adults are tasked with locating possessed items that cause problems and lead to the deaths of innocent victims and users of the items. Although this show does remind me of that dark and sinister show, ""Warehouse"" has a lighter agenda and makes for a well developed television show. I also have to mention that the special effects for a show that appears to have a decent operating budget are pretty good for a weekly television show. The characters are very deep and keep you wanting to learn more about their pasts. If the show does not get canceled, I plan on watching this show on a weekly basis. Thumbs up to SYFY in their new format on a very good and well thought out show.",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2022,OperaTarte,9," Genius!
","Re-discovered this 'minor-masterpiece' of fun & originality when the Sci=Fi channel ran it for an entire month this summer. I didn't quite realize how badly originality, creativity & fun without compromising essence - had devolved in both TV & films. Nothing in it to make bristle any PC devotees - Warehouse 13 has substance - *translated* - it is ENTERTAINING. Being a history buff helps, but the episodes can also instigate interest in every subject imaginable. In its own way - it teaches in the most inobtrusive way. Please bring it back. If L&O can attempt a come-back & fall flat on its proverbial once good reputation - Warehouse 13 is a definite A+!",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2009,jamfitz001,4," Fun Concept plagued by mediocre execution
","Two sexy Federal Agents dealing with the Paranormal? It seems impossible to not make the X-files comparison. With a few exceptions (that occurred well after the characters were established), the X-file episodes always played it straight. The show worked because it took its mythology so seriously. Warehouse 13 tacts towards a light, humorous take, perhaps for no other reason than to avoid a direct X-files comparison.",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2011,freema78-159-516638,," Fun Fast-Paced Action/Comedy Show
","I always look forward to watching Warehouse 13. It's a mix of adventure, mystery, and comedy, with elements of X-Files, Fringe, Moonlighting, The Librarian, 24, and Unsolved Mysteries.",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2009,scottwallvashon,3," I'll give it a chance, but it will probably wear thin.
","Warehouse 13 is a high concept synthesis of The Librarian, The Lost Room, Ghostbusters, and myriad other shows. It is the kind of bricolage the SciFi/SyFy/sigh...fie Channel has come to specialize in.",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2010,sheydari,3," So much potential wasted
","The idea of artifacts with special powers had already been put into a successful film - Syfy brilliant miniseries ""The Lost Room"" in 2006. Fans like myself were thrilled to hear that a new series -warehouse 13- would pick up the idea and develop it into a longer show. and I have been following warehouse 13 since then.",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2021,bheadher,9," This was the creme de la creme weird fun series...
","It made it to 5 seasons, and should have been 'fixed' for a few more years...I always loved the steam punk flavor of the warehouse itself, and the old sometimes ancient artifacts were usually super...it was a fun series that tried to make sense of all the weird stuff that goes on around the world, with mostly wel written scripts and great FX improvisation...I miss the suspence frankly...",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2009,heymikeymo,9," Give it a chance
","I watched the pilot and Warehouse 13 has all the elements you would want in a good science fiction series. There is the endless room of gadgets and trinkets so who knows what they could find. There is a story for each character, with a history that is slowly to be revealed. Its possible to have a new twist every week which is all you ask for. Its well written and the characters are likable. And there is comedy and snappy dialogue to make it a touch edgy. I especially liked the offer of cookies to come inside the warehouse. The main character, who is a first leery, jumps right at that in a very funny way. If you liked the X-Files weirdness and Eureka's comedy, this is for you.",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2009,cirqus-2,8," Warehouse 13 - oddities conjure humour, wonderment and the profound.
","What a surprising little gem Warehouse 13 has turned out to be. I feel the creative team in control have only just begun tapping into the almost limitless supply of stories available to them with this cracking premise they have conjured. Not surprising really as one of the show's creators is Jane Espenson who wrote some of the best and funniest of Joss Whedon's episodes for Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel and Firefly.",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2013,bogus-bogus-one,2," Not so good - like all SyFy shows since the StarGate series ended
","I really enjoy Science Fiction and I will usually give a lot of room to anything in the genre. I expect the shows to be a little ""cheesy"" due to limited production budgets. The best shows use their resources with imagination and creativity to deliver truly interesting entertainment. ",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2020,jeffsingletary,5," A Series that could have been.
",Most of the comments are spot on.,/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2009,nkuhn721,," The show seems familiar to me.
","This comment may have been made already but, does anyone else see how much this show is a lot like Friday the 13th: The TV series? I loved that show when it was on so i'm really enjoying Warehouse 13 but i was curious if it was just me. Of course, the set up is different but the whole cursed objects and having to retrieve them is dead on. I do like the government connection since i was a big fan of X-files! Hopefully this show will win viewers and we will be able to keep another good one on the air for a change, i'm just sick of the reality shows for now. Anyway, I plan to continue watching since they really aren't any other good shows on at the moment.",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2009,yourdeadmeat69,5," Too Cutesy for Adult Entertainment
","Rubinek is too fine an actor, with an excellent edge for this kind of 12 year old aimed, almost slapstick direction. The shows have creativity and could be a lot edgier without the ""Man From Uncle"" attitude, it's just unwatchable by anyone over the age of puberty.",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2009,Minou07,1," Cheap, Cheesy, Knock-Off of Better Programs
","If this program is our intro to the new ""SyFy"" Channel, they can keep it.! Warehouse 13 is the Ed Wood equivalent of ""The Librarian,"" ""Indiana Jones,"" and any other program that offers superior entertainment about mystical objects. Just replace the superior CGI special effects, good acting, and interesting scripts for those movies/programs, and we have Warehouse 13. The first episode introduces us to the most irritating people who deservedly belong in the desert where they can't harm or annoy anyone else. Unfortunately they supposedly have oversight over some great and powerful objects, like Houdini's wallet. Uh-huh. All the main characters fall in the usual seen that, been there category. The female is intelligent but bossy and pushy. The male is handsome but a bungler. The keeper of Warehouse 13 stutters and flutters and never makes a clear statement. The three stooges are now in charge of the great Warehouse, which is actually an incredibly cheaply made metal building in the sand. The interior is not much better, using more cheap metal and wood shelving to hold the great and powerful objects. My friends and I could have produced this if we had a couple of thousand and an outdated video cam. It would at least be more creative than this stupid stuff.",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2012,danny-me-you,3," An insult to intelligence.

10 July 2009,Vic_max,," SyFy's newest sci-fi show ...
","Some of the best sci-fi series seem to be those which take themselves seriously. Their tone and atmosphere are serious and bits of humor are ""added"" to lighten things up. Warehouse 13 doesn't really fall into this category; it's a bit different. ",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2010,Tweekums,8," Views on season one
","When I first saw trailers for this series I thought it was going to be 'X-Files lite' but thought I'd give it a go anyway. I'm glad I did as it is quite different, the only real similarity is that both feature two agents, one female, one male who are investigated strange goings on. There are no signs of aliens however here they are trying to recover various artefacts which are some how imbued with strange powers. The leading characters are Pete Lattimer and Myka Bering, two secret service agents who wind themselves transferred to a remote warehouse in South Dakota. Here they are met by Artie Nielsen, the man who runs the place, he explains that it will be their job to retrieve the mystical artefacts and to return them to the warehouse. Early episodes concentrate on them retrieving an artefact each week but later a plot arc starts featuring former warehouse agent MacPherson who is trying to get his hands on the artefacts for his own personal reasons.",/review/rw2272459/?ref_=tt_urv
