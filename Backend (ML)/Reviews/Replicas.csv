25 September 2018,nycruise-1,1," Tom Selleck was a MALE MODEL
","Let's start there. Before any viewers had given the original show a chance, they all tuned in to see HOT Tom Selleck. Once they experienced the ""flair"" of the show and its title character, people fell IN LOVE.",/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2018,majormadmax,2," Honestly, if this wasn't a Magnum P.I. remake, it wouldn't be that bad...

25 September 2018,nx-895-663057,1," Why call it Magnum
","Seeing the name of the 1st episode I thought that maybe the writers were magnum fans and maybe this would be good. It wasn't. The characters are uncomfortable, makes me uncomfortable. The stunts are unrealistic, the plot was weak and made no sense. The whole thing was really bad. The episode had nothing to do with the title. It truly amazes me how disconnected Hollywood is to the public. This could have been great if it were written intelligently with all the new technology. Instead it's unwatchable. Higgins a woman? Very sad.......",/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2019,VideoMagicRental,8," Take a minute to read this coming from a big fan of the original series
","Let me start with making one thing very clear: I was (and still am) a big fan of the orignal series. No love lost over the last 30 years, I still watch the original series and nothing can be compared to it.",/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2019,montgomerysue,10," give it a chance
","As the weeks have gone by since its debut, this show has really become quite enjoyable. The stories are very interesting and entertaining and the cast really works well together. You get the feeling that as more episodes were filmed, the five regular players got to know and like each other so that the characters they play took on more depth and emotion. Expanding the role that Amy Hill plays (quite well) was a plus, as well as adding some really good humorous scenes. The cinematography here is outstanding, especially since there are so many actual ""location"" shots and the editing is excellent. Really nicely acted and filmed. A fun way to spend an hour with fast-moving action, mystery, humor, and five characters who you come to care about.",/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2019,agnabeya,10," Came wanting to hate it- stayed to really enjoy it.
","Of course they could have called it something else- but then Selleck fans would have hated the copy-cat similarities. In my house we have really enjoyed it-I don't know what people were expecting. We knew Selleck wouldn't be in it- and I am getting used to the female Higgins. I thought I would hate it- bit it's quickly become scheduled watching. Escapist fun in Hawaii- what's not love? I did not expect the original- so why are people who loved the original wailing unrealistically that it is not the same as the original? I am enjoying it for what it is- just the same as the original- an enjoyable piece of fluff filmed in paradise. Then, perhaps I am not stuck in the 80s.",/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2018,rsvp321,," Another Hollywood PC EPIC FAIL!
","Brain dead writers ruined another classic, because they don't have the imagination to invent a new show so they leach off someone else's success, and heavy-dose inject political and social agendas instead of entertainment for the audience.",/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2021,roigbiv,10," Very enjoyable, take it as it is.
","Quite surprised that the rating here for Magnum PI is low. I get that it's a reboot so maybe expectations are high. However, if you enjoy light crime show procedurals then you should try this out! Not to mention the great dynamic between the characters for added oomph into the show.",/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2018,phantom-20,6," Magnum P.C.
","I got douche chills when I originally saw the new series trailer. It typified a lot of what I find wrong with Hollywood these days! I watched the pilot and it was as underwhelming and ill conceived as expected. Why not go full PC and make T.C. a female combat pilot and Rick trans gender while they are at it?
Anxiously awaiting that re boot of ""F Troop"" starring David Hasselhoff and Kevin Hart. All the enjoyment of drinking warm, flat soda. Ugh...Meh! Hollywood really can screw up toast!",/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2019,Patchista,9," No it's not the old Magnum, but this one has plenty of heart!
","Not too heavy, gorgeous scenery, diverse actors and a sense of humour. I will definitely keep watching. No, it isn't the same show as the original, but it's good on its own. Great message about family and friends.",/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv

",Magnum PI without mustaches??????,/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2018,MiketheWhistle,7," Don't like this reboot either
","It should make me feel younger to have so many of the shows I watched when younger being de-mothballed, but they all just miss the mark. It's certainly a high bar along the lines of one's lost first-love, but mostly I feel like the acting and inter-acting chemistry never lives up. The actors that they put on these shows I feel like are just not of the caliber of the original cast. If it was one show, then maybe it'd be my perception, but after Magum, MacGyver, Wonder Woman, Dallas, SWAT, etc as well as several old tv shows remade into movies. Funny enough the one that I think hit the mark was Battlestar Gallactica. Maybe it will improve.",/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2018,m-fallon67,1," Bad. Really bad.
","Like others, I was willing to give this reboot a try. What a huge disappointment. I tried to separate myself from the original, and look at the show objectively. Problem is, the show has bad acting, bad writing, bad plot, and NO realism. Actor Jay Hernandez , a small man, just has no screen presence, which the lead actor must have. There is an old saying. Never follow a legend, Tom Selleck was legendary. Now really, a Hispanic dude, with the name Thomas Magnum? The rest of the PC silliness, is Higgins is a 110lbs woman, who beats the crap out of two bad former Marines, both around 200lbs. each. When they fight little Navy Seal Thomas Magnum, the beat the crap out of him! Please! This won't last one season.",/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2019,ronbell-23984,1," PC box ticking exercise
",Terrible. This programme really is just an exercise is PC be box ticking. I wish production companies would stop using their shows to push political agendas.,/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2019,ros-90-144558,8," An easy enjoyable watch
","This show is an easy watch; The Hawaii scenery is beautiful, the storylines are entertaining and the characters are likeable. I hope the show gets a second season!",/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2018,kfss264,8," Good Reboot
","I like this new version of one of my absolute favorite shows. Not a carbon copy of the original Magnum, PI; rather it is a modern, and slightly different take on the Magnum story. This is however, a different Magnum for a different time. This show can't take anything away from the original, it can only build on it.",/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2018,juliefolden,6," Big Disappointment
","I loved the original show and was excited to see the remake. Huge disappointment. Weak acting, characters, storyline. Took me a bit to realize this wasn't supposed to be a slapstick remake. So disappointed. Can't believe this is a CBS show. Well below this network's standards.",/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2019,mjking-17200,7," It's only improving!
",I liked the first season but I did think it was a bit cheesy. Only three episodes in to season 2 and I'm loving everything I'm seeing. The character's are being better developed the chemistry between Higgins and Magnum is really great. And I'm a sucker for anything set in Hawaii. I think this will replace Hawaii Five-0 for me!,/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2019,carey-941-755692,5," It's not that Higgins is a woman, it is that she is a young woman
","For some reason, there are many reviewers here who are upset about Higgins being portrayed by a woman. I don't really care about Higgins being cast as a woman. What I miss is the relationship in the original show, a relationship which cannot exist in this reboot of the show.",/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2018,neoanderson12,2," I never watched the first Magnum but what is this ?
",The hero gets beaten down to the pulp by two ex marines while the heroine gets shot in the arm and still moves around and acts all badass. Seriously who is the real hero of this series ?,/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2018,carnes-2,1," The disappointment was inevitable
","Recorded the first episode out of morbid curiosity more than interest, just to see what they changed and what they kept, with no expectation that they could ever come close to the original. ",/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2019,ThunderKing6,," Load of BS
",Why do they continue to make remakes when 96% of remakes look trash.,/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2022,bosporan,9," Candyfloss and popcorn - fun and frivolous
","I remember being enthralled by Tom Selleck as Magnum when I was a child. This is not that, but it has the same structure and is light entertaining fun. The Higgins dynamic has changed with the introduction of the lovely Perdita Weeks, an ex-MI6 operative who partners Magnum (Jay Hernandez) in his investigations. They share an ongoing 'will they, won't they' dynamic and as of season 4 the answer seems to be not yet. The format is a weekly case with an occasional recurring arc.",/review/rw8046652/?ref_=tt_urv
