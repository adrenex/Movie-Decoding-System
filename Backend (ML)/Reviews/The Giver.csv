","I loved the concept, which resonated loudly with me. As one that is allergic to 'physical sport' & actually any proactive exercise, and has geek & nerd tendencies in abundance, this piqued my interest. More than that, it's actually got me moving a bit.",/review/rw8822896/?ref_=tt_urv

","Found this documentary very motivating and inspiring. I loved the characters, especially Ben. He needs his own series as a follow up!",/review/rw8822896/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,lewis_pritchard,4," Longform Asics advert which fails to sell exercise
","I'll preface this by saying that I am brand loyal to Asics; their shoes got me through my first marathon 5 years ago and since then I've only purchased Asics clothing. The fact that this documentary was produced by Asics was the main reason I watched it so I was prepared for a glorified advert, which is not my issue with the film.",/review/rw8822896/?ref_=tt_urv

24 January 2023,almeripelser,10," Not your average documentary
","If you're used to snooze-inducing documentaries, then be prepared to experience the opposite effect! Mind Games - The Experiment will have you reaching for your running shoes, inspired to get up, go out, and exercise more.",/review/rw8822896/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2023,pachevallier,10," Interesting and exciting documentary!
","I really loved this film, in fact more of a documentary highlighting a quite unknown fact: the beneficial effects of sport activities on the brain and cognitive skills of humans. Also fun and easy to follow, I highly recommend to watch it on Amazon prime. Through the lens of different people, we see the evolution and the perseverance that more physical activity gives them. Fortunately no fake marketing but a well done production, especially for a quite small budget, this film is really not boring for a second. It actually conveys really well the values of a sound mind in a sound body which is a beautiful morality.",/review/rw8822896/?ref_=tt_urv
