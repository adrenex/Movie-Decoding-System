14 May 2018,TriggerPullerUSMC,7," I REALLY Liked This Movie
",My movie needs are simple. I want to be entertained. that is it. I don't need any fancy references or nods to previous movies or directors etc. I don't need to be informed or moved or left speechless. ,/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv

16 May 2018,iantrader,5," Worth watching but not as good as it thinks it is
","I'll start with my usual writer/director moan although this isn't as bad as most, and Vaughn Stein almost pulls it off.",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2018,meliz,7," I really enjoyed this movie - try for yourself!
","One should more or less never listen to others when it comes to movies. For me, I have barely heard about this movie so I decided giving it a go (not knowing what I ventured into). ",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2018,SnoopyStyle,4," badly written
","In a grim neon-filled dark cityscape, Bill (Simon Pegg) is terminally ill and looking for a train at an empty terminal. The janitor (Mike Myers) informs him that no train is coming that night. Annie (Margot Robbie) is a waitress leading a double life as stripper/assassin Bunny. She gives thugs Vince (Dexter Fletcher) and Alfred (Max Irons) a suitcase which leads to a devastating contract killing.",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2021,I_should_be_reading_a_book,8," Painfully slow start but very watchable
",I don't get the low ratings.,/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2019,joshteggert,2," In his attempt to voguishly blend themes from Alice in Wonderland together with Sin City and Blade Runner, Stein has instead created a monstrously inconsistent mess.
","Vaughn Stein has worked for years in the film industry, largely as second or third assistant director in projects ranging from 2013 blockbuster World War Z to award-winning indie flick Pride. Now, he finally releases his first feature-length film, Terminal, to UK cinemas - a project that he's had a rough cut of since 2016, which screened at Toronto International Film Festival that year.",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2018,Red-Barracuda,6," A visually resplendant modern noir, which is lacking in the story department
","A crime-lord, two gangsters, a dying school-teacher, a waitress and a janitor are the characters who operate in and around a train terminal in the dead of night. Their stories inter-connect in unexpected ways.",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2018,swoonedd,8," Great execution
","The story isn't new, but to see comics make a noir film is really interesting. And how they ha e done it really good. ",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2018,CANpatbuck3664,6," An Unbelievable Ending Makes Terminal Worth Checking Out
","Terminal was ripped to shreds by critics, I see why but I don't think they gave it enough credit. There's a lot of futuristic noir flourishes, the movie is bathing in neon light and seedy environments. This isn't new, its Blade Runner-esque but the cinematography is admittedly gorgeous in this. Just because it has been done before (lately with Altered Carbon and Mute) doesn't make it any less impressive. It was a nice touch and it deserves to be mentioned, even if it doesn't quite save the movie.",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2018,bostonct,7," This is a lot better than the ratings
","Cleaver dialogue from all the characters, a bit of crazy gruesome, plus a few twists and you have an entertaining movie. If you liked Snatch, Sherlock Holmes or Lock, Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels, you'll find this enjoyable enough. Not Guy Richie good, but entertaining enough.",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2020,compugor,7," A Visual Treat with Exceptional Denouement
","Not sure about the acting diversity of Ms. Robbie (The Suicide Squad) but she's got the crazy hot thing down pat, and she is alluringly attractive enough to carry the whole movie, which she does. Not that Pegg and Meyers don't give respectable supporting performances. The screenplay is quite stunning visually, with a futuristic neon tinge to everything that is darkly mysterious and gorgeous at the same time. The seedy story unfolds in such a disjointed way that it sucks for a while, but just when you're about to be bored to death, it explodes with a series of reveals that explain everything by narrated flashbacks, which go above & beyond anything you could have expected. Thumbs down for the tedious buildup, especially all the f-word dialog and hateful coarseness by one of the assassins (played by Fletcher), but bravo for the ending, which is not for the squeamish.",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2018,cesnovar-andrej,8," Why the hate?
","I don't usually post reviews on IMDb - other people have already done it, and often better than I could - and most of the time, I find the ratings more or less on par with my own impressions of movies.",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2018,iamianiman,5," Terminal is the Movie that Lets You Wait at the Station for Hours...
","Unknown, bewildered and mysterious. Those are the words that appear across your mind as this tarted-up noir feelings cartoon shows itself with flamboyant colors spread around the hollow space of the ominous underground of terminal.",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2018,Leofwine_draca,1," An embarrassment
","TERMINAL is one of those student-feeling movies that thinks it's far clever than it actually is. It's a real dud of a production, stilted and awkward throughout, a movie which is made to sound like a thriller but instead turns out to be a meandering, dialogue-focused character twist. It looks cheap and fake, with dead surroundings and unrealistic backdrops. The film attempts to tell a number of micro-stories from an ensemble cast, similar to PULP FICTION, and all held together by the horrid Margot Robbie who embarrasses herself with a plummy British accent. Simon Pegg looks about 60 here while Dexter Fletcher is bored out of his head, and who can blame him? I'd enjoyed not seeing Mike Myers around for years so the merest sight of him was enough to give me the shudders. This slow, meandering film takes an age to get around to the twist ending, which is so stupid, so basic and nonsensical, that I was actively embarrassed by what I was seeing.",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2019,butterfliesinautumn,9," Deliciously Wicked
","My man and I watched this movie by sheer happenstance. We were movie surfing on a quiet night and saw that Simon Pegg is in this movie. We decided, as we always do with a potential viewing, to give it 15 minutes. We were snatched in within a few minutes. The story, the cinematography and the plunge into the darker depths of neo noir....and Simon Pegg? Totally irresistible.",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2019,tokanac,10," Better than I had expected!
",First I will say that this movie was not at all what I was expecting!,/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2018,torrascotia,1," Yes, its as bad as they say it is.
","I watched this based on the great cast and the trailer. I wish I had read a few more of the reviews before committing to watching however.
This is an odd movie, in that it takes place in a strange environment lit with neon and hardly anyone else apart from the main protagonists, so its almost a kind of fantasy movie. The one star is awarded purely on the fact this movie looks pretty good, but this wears thin fairly quickly.
The problem with the people as they are portrayed is that their is no one that you latch onto, everyone seems to be some type of horrible person or a psycho so you don't really care what happens to anyone.
The story has a number of twists and apart from one the rest are guessable, the fact is that if there are only so many players in the game, its not hard to guess who the ""hidden"" person is, or that they may have met in the past etc.
I was quite surprised to discover it was possible to have so much acting talent on screen and , albeit mostly B movie grade, and still not feel engaged with the story.
The ending was particularly poor, p.s. that isn't how that procedure was carried out and it wouldn't have had the effect portrayed in the movie. It also seemed to out of step with the rest of the tone of the film, it seemed more extreme than the rest of the violence. It was also oddly unsatisfactory as an ending, like I said, if you aren't rooting for the main character or anyone then its hard to feel contentment if they find a resolution. 
If you liked Only God Forgives you may like this, it has a similar neon style over substance emptiness to it which will polarise an audience with a majority disliking it.",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2018,Sam667,2," ""A load of f**king nonsense""
","A whole lot of colored neon lights instead of an interesting movie.
It's boring, tedious, redundant and predictable.
It wants to be cool and hip, but only succeeds in straining my patience, I had to fast forward to the end.",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2018,Frame-By-Frame,5," stylish but mediocre
","Despite some excellent acting performances this film didn't do much for me. I felt like it was trying too hard to be too many things. 
Using a mixture of various film makers styles it just didn't seem to provide anything fresh. The story telling method used too many twists to work successfully. If stylish visuals and multi layered stories are your main thing then give it a go. Otherwise you may find some of the negative comments and low scores this film has attracted to be justified.",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2018,nickpeev,8," Entertaining and darkish
","I rarely write a review, but this one deserves it.",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2018,feev,9," Awesome... Different... Cool
",Super enjoyable.... Very clever and fill of surprises ... Hope this director gets his due AND continues making great movies like THIS 👍👍👍,/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2018,journeyousglory,6," style over substance
","Loaded with Alice references and quotes - but the only similarities in common with the classic tale is the theme of madness, which in this case was taken and ran with. This movie is decibel lit more style than substance, and curiosity will keep you moving through it despite the badly drawn plot. Characters did their best with what they were given.. Style over substance. It was just my style, really, if only there was more, anything more, to go on.",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2018,rockman182,6," Terminal (2018)
","I was admittedly not a fan of Margot Robbie when she first starting making waves. I didn't go crazy for her in early films or her portrayal as Harley Quinn. What did make me a fan of her was her portrayal of Tonya Harding in I, Tonya. She was really tremendous in that film. When i saw the trailer for Terminal I thought it was something I could love. It looked like a female driven, cult classic, that had a lot of style. Was also surprised that virtually no theaters were showing this (thank god for video on demand).",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2018,Propagandist,7," The artistic mystery is not dead
","Yes, this movie is probably not everyone's cup of tea. I very much liked the chamber play like reduction of characters, scenes and places, and the gaudy but dark colouring (no oxymoron here). However, I can understand if this strikes some viewers as exaggerated or arty. The same is probably true for its plethora of cultural references and slow pace.
Apart from that, Terminal is a solid mystery thriller with some nice twist, for which enough hints are delivered to anticipate them, but still enough doubt is being spread to keep you guessing. What I liked most is that more or less all characters are introduced as likeable, even if some of them are not.
For better viewing pleasure, I would recommend not to learn too much about the film in advance. I was lucky enough to know only a few details and would have preferred not to know that revenge is part of the plot.
The writing was great, it featured enough humour to let the drama get close to you, eventually. The cast was at least convincing but mostly excellent.
By the way, if you wonder about the headline: go see Terminal.",/review/rw4495711/?ref_=tt_urv
