4 November 2015,ivo-cobra8,10," One of the best underrated action thriller movies from Sylvester Stallone my personal favorite
",Cliffhanger (1993) is one of the best Action thriller heist movies of the 90's. I love this film to death! It is one of my personal favorite movies. Besides the Rocky and Rambo which are Stallone's most popular stuff I would put Cliffhanger right above those! I absolutely LOVE this film!!!! Gabe Walker is awesome I love it. I would put this movie over Rambo III and Cobra because I have enjoy it more than those two films. I don't like Rambo III it is a bad action movie. I love Cobra but Cliffhanger beats Cobra and I love Cliffhanger to death It is my childhood movie. ,/review/rw1144014/?ref_=tt_urv

23 July 2004,supertom-3,8," Action Classic!
","Sly's best out and out action film. It is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters, solid performances and Renny Harlins direction is stylishly assured. Stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films and he certainly looks the part in terms of the action scenes. This was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the 90's, a definite genre classic. As a Stallone fan this is one I look back on with fond memories. Plenty of superb action and Sly in prime action man form. Action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good aciton film. The film looks great and there is great support from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. ****",/review/rw1144014/?ref_=tt_urv

13 May 2005,AwesomeWolf,9," Almost Stallone's best
","I don't think I'll ever understand the hate for Renny Harlin. 'Die Hard 2' was cool, and he gave the world 'Cliffhanger', one of the most awesome action movies ever. That's right, you little punks, 'Cliffhanger' rules, and we all know it.",/review/rw1144014/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2009,tburke85,7," Cliffhanger A Decent Action Crime Adventure With Some Flaws
","Cliffhanger is a decent action crime adventure with some flaws from director Renny Harlin whose admirable in making this movie about an expert climber who finds himself taken hostage with a fellow friend by a gang of dangerous criminals on the search for suit cases full of stolen cash in the Rocky Mountains. Sylvester Stallone is impressive as Gabe Walker the expert climber especially in the action/fight sequences but some of them definitely border on the line of unrealistic. For the sake of the film though I willing to suspend my disbelief. The rest of the cast including John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall, and Leon are respectable as the supporting characters in the movie. The action/fight sequences are well executed but as mentioned before some aren't very realistic no matter how tough you are. The climbing sequences however are very well done because instead of doing the whole film in a studio somewhere the locations they chose felt very real and the Ariel views of the mountain ranges are marvelous adding a touch of reality to the movie. The deaths are inventive while others are sort of predictable. The villains are solid but it would've been better if they had focused on a more central one instead of having many of them. The pacing of the movie was a little slow but the good outweighs the bad in this one. If you're a big fan of Harlins or Stallone's than chances are you'll enjoy this one too. Overall Cliffhanger has character development with enough action, drama, some suspense, excitement, thrills, and good performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch.",/review/rw1144014/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2004,PhilipJames1980,8," Ah, nostalgia for an old-fashioned action movie!
","Watching Cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early '90s, a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as ""Die Hard in a /on a.""  Cliffhanger is ""Die Hard on a mountain,"" and pretty good, for what it is.",/review/rw1144014/?ref_=tt_urv

16 May 2017,Tweekums,8," Great high altitude action
","Gabe Walker was a rescue worker in the Rocky Mountains but after an accident where he was unable to save the life of a friend he has left the mountains. Almost a year later he returns hoping to persuade his girlfriend, Jessie, to come back to Denver with him. He has no intention to go climbing but events conspire against him. A treasury plane transporting a hundred million dollars is intercepted and hijacked in an audacious attempt to steal the money. The robbery doesn't go according to plan and the three cases full of cash fall into the mountains and the hijacker's plane makes a forced landing. They then put out a false emergency call, claiming to be lost hikers. Gabe's former friend, Hal Tucker, responds to the Call and Jessie persuades Gabe to go too although it soon becomes clear that Hal hasn't blames him for what happened in the opening scene. That is all put behind them though when they are forced to help the hijackers. Gabe is forced to climb for one of the cases but when he finds it he scatters the money and then escapes as the villains accidentally trigger an avalanche. While Hal is forced to continue helping, Gabe meets up with Jessie and the two of them play cat and mouse with the hijackers in an attempt to get to the cash first and save Hal.",/review/rw1144014/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2016,NateWatchesCoolMovies,10," One of the best action films ever made
","Renny Harlin's Cliffhanger is to this day one the best and most exhilarating action films of the 1990's. It's big, bold and full of protein for lovers oft the genre. From the lively villain to the unbelievable stunts to the set pieces, it's a tough package to beat. A stunning, vertigo inducing opener set high atop a snowy peak that ends in tragedy. A breathtaking airial heist carried out between two planes via cable wire. A whopper of a helicopter crash. Countless bone snapping, visceral hand to hand combat scenes. The list goes on. Sylvester Stallone puts his physique to great use as Gabe Walker, a rock climbing mountaineer guide who is accidentally responsible for the falling death of his best friend's girlfriend. His buddy Hal (Michael Rooker) blames him no end, and he leaves in personal disgrace. Elsewhere, ruthless backstabbing psychopath Eric Qualen, (John Lithgow) leads a team of dangerous mercenaries through aforementioned heist, plundering millions from a US treasury department plane and disappearing into the snowy desolation. Soon they come across Hal and a group of people touring the region, who are soon hostages. Word somehow gets out to Stallone and he's back in business, out for redemption and then chance to brutally dispatch this gang of snow pirates. The action, refreshingly absent of digital gimmicks, packs one hell of a punch. Every fight scene feels breathless, dangerous and desperate. Every blow is thunderously felt, courtesy of director Harlin's commitment to his work and the efforts of a stellar stunt team. Stallone isna beast and I forget that every time I haven't seen him in a while. He's almost as big as the mountains he scales here and each and every bad guy damn well finds this out. Rooker is as intense as he always is, love the guy. Lithgow is a freaking villain for the ages, in a role intended first for David Bowie, then Christopher Walken. I'm glad the ball ended up in his court, because he subsequently knocks it back out of the park with his cold blooded, deliciously evil performance. He makes Qualen so scary and merciless that even his own people get the jitters around him. There's also work from Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall, Craig Fairbrass, Max Perlich, Paul Winfield, Ralph Waite, Don S. Davis, Bruce McGill and Janine Turner. This is just one of the finest action movies to ever swing into theatres or onto DVD. Brutal, scenic, adventurous, exciting, violent, snowy, just plain kick ass. If you don't like this movie, you don't like ice cream.",/review/rw1144014/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2019,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,10," Best action movie in the 90's - thrills in the Rocky Mountains my favorite Stallone flick
","Cliffhanger is Stallone's best action 90's movie of all time! I love this film to death, it is one of my personal favorite action movies and personal favorite Stallone movies. It is practical, they are practical dangerous stunts. They are real models, the real Rocky Mountains not CGI graphic dated. The scene locations were filmed in Rome, Lazio, Italy. They are the real Rocky Mountains, tough the movie is set in Colorado, USA. Everyone of the cast even director did an amazing job. It is man vs nature vs hijackers, ""Die Hard"" on a mountains.",/review/rw1144014/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2014,juneebuggy,9," This movie is still impressive 20 years later
","I just did a long overdue re-watch of Cliffhanger and it stood up really well. Definitely one of Stallone's better (less cheesy) action flicks and seeing his body in its prime is pretty nice too :) That opening scene gets me every time but I enjoyed everything about this (even if you do have to suspend disbelief occasionally) The action, the stunts, the scenery, the cast. John Lithgow is great as the bad guy, although his British accent could use some work as it fades in and out, he seems to be relishing playing this character though. Also fun to see Michael Rooker from The Walking Dead in an earlier role, I had forgotten he was in this.",/review/rw1144014/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2006,Ricky_Roma__,," Die Hard on a mountain (spoilers)
","The opening to Cliffhanger is meant to be a harrowing experience. We're meant to feel terrible that an innocent woman plunges to her horrible death. But how can we experience the horror when Frank, a helicopter pilot played by Ralph Waite out of The Waltons, is in the background cackling with laughter. Just watch him. His eyes sparkle when Stallone tells the woman that she's not doing to die and he collapses in near hysterics when she falls. Contrast this with Michael Rooker's overacting  he almost faints when the girl plummets, while Frank is hooting in the background  and you have a scene that is nowhere near as powerful as it should be.",/review/rw1144014/?ref_=tt_urv

","Finnish director Renny Harlin, whose career gradually nosedived after the massive financial disaster that was pirate adventure Cutthroat Island, really should have stuck to the freezing cold environment he clearly knew so well: having already scored a massive hit with his sub-zero Die Hard sequel in 1990, he had an even bigger box-office success with snow-bound action adventure Cliffhanger, which starred Sylvester Stallone as mountain ranger Gabe Walker, who unwittingly finds himself pitted against a ruthless gang of plane hijackers searching for their lost cargo of cash.",/review/rw1144014/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2009,sddavis63,7," Fun High Altitude Action Movie
","Overall, I thought this was a pretty passable action/adventure movie that featured a bit of an outlandish story about a group of international criminals who steal millions of dollars from a US Treasury plane and then have to depend on a couple of mountain rescuers to help them find it after a crash. The movie featured pretty good performances from the very versatile John Lithgow as the mastermind criminal Eric Qualen, as well as from the generally one-dimensional (read Rocky Balboa) Sylvester Stallone as climber Gabe Walker, who overcomes a tragedy at the start of the movie to become the great hero by the end. There was some pretty exciting action that was scattered throughout the movie, thus keeping the viewer interested, a lot of bad guys to root against, and a good supporting performance from Michael Rooker as Walker's rescuer sidekick Hal Tucker. In addition to the outlandish plot, there were a few things that just didn't work for me. Why it was decided that this movie needed to include a couple of pretty typical ""stoner-type"" characters is a bit beyond me. The two kids added nothing to the movie and really served only to irritate me. Then there was the absolutely unnecessary (and at least mercifully brief) bat-scene in the crack through which Walker and Jessie (Janine Turner) were crawling. That also accomplished nothing except allowing any bat-squeamish viewers to go ""eeewww"" when Walker sticks his hand in guano and the bats start to fly at them. Finally, does anyone actually believe that John Lithgow could hold his own in a fistfight with Sylvester Stallone the way the respective characters did at the end of this movie? Not likely, in my opinion. For all that, for a movie with a story that was at best very limited, this movie was fun most of the way through, which gains it a 7/10.",/review/rw1144014/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2011,neil-476,9," Terrific action adventure
","Cliffhanger came at a very interesting point in Sylvester Stallone's career. After Rocky kicked him into the big league, he seemed to settle into a career pattern of gradual decline - Rocky and Rambo sequels with diminishing returns, and a succession of identikit action thrillers which passed the time and did little else. Then there was the ill-advised venture into action comedy with Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot!, and suddenly the decline was an outright slump.",/review/rw1144014/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2003,Aaron1375,9," Stallone's last really good movie.
","Well Demolition Man had its moments, but for me, this was Stallone's last good movie.  Part of the reason is the great scenery here as the mountain shots are breathtaking and they were really good in the theater.  This one is a lot better than the recent mountain movie Vertical Limit in that it has a much better plot.  In this one some guys who steal money from a plane and end up crashing on the mountains.  Lithgow is the villain here and he is great.  They get the mountain rescue team to come help them.  Stallone who has been out of the loop because of an accident also goes to lend a hand. The thieves basically hold Stallone and his friend captive and get them to locate their money, which is in three suitcases on the mountain.  Stallone gets away and proceeds to get in the thieves' way any chance he can get.  I can't believe someone thought the action scenes were dull, but to each his own.  I think this movie is great to watch and it has one heck of a conclusion.",/review/rw1144014/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2005,Lechuguilla,," Living On The Edge
","If you are interested in outdoor adventure, or if you have ever wanted to be a rock climber, this is the film to see. It is set in rugged, wilderness terrain, amid spectacular mountain peaks and spires. But, in addition to the magnificent scenery, ""Cliffhanger"" has something more. Most adventure films are scaled horizontally. ""Cliffhanger"" is scaled vertically. This up and down perspective thus conveys a genuine sense of physical danger. Director Renny Harlin keeps the camera in motion, and uses visual and special effects to provide the viewer with the perception of vertigo.",/review/rw1144014/?ref_=tt_urv
