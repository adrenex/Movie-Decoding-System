7 November 2020,MinistryofDoom,7," A Fun Entertaining Post-Apocalyptic Rom-Com with the Cutest Dog EVER
","This film came out of nowhere. I hadn't heard anything about it, but I took a chance on it and I loved it! Love and Monsters was a really fun entertaining film. I really enjoyed the combination of romantic comedy and sci-fi/horror. It was well written, the acting was on point, and the film direction was very good. I really enjoyed the world-building in this film. The atmosphere and monsters were done very well. The post-apocalyptic world in this film is much different than in others where it's dark and murky. This film was bright and colorful and really showed that after 95% of humanity was gone, the environment took over un-restricted. Planes buried in mountains covered in vines, buildings overgrown with plants and trees, etc....It just looked really really good. Also....bonus points for having the cutest dog I have ever seen in my entire life! I think everyone who watches this is going to fall in love with that adorable brown puppy...and how could they not??? Great movie! Very well executed and definitely leaves you wanting more. I hope this is the start of something new!",/review/rw6223681/?ref_=tt_urv

",Solid well made movie - very good casting to put Dylan Obrien in this role - he works it perfectly. The rest of the cast is good and the special effects are well done. Solid plot and good action fun film. Worth watching.,/review/rw6223681/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2020,ruidanielbarrossss,8," Great Apocalyptic Feel-Good Movie.
","""Monster Problems"" has action, fantasy, comedy, survival and even love. It is a film for the whole family, but it manages to be quite tense, especially in action scenes involving monsters.",/review/rw6223681/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2020,BandSAboutMovies,8," A great movie!
","Of all the films that I've watched over quarantine, Love and Monsters is the one that deserved to play in a theater.",/review/rw6223681/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2020,mmevanille-53097,9," Endearing
","This is one of the best recent adventure films. It avoids many clich√©s that inhabit the genre, with small twists which made watching it a pleasure.",/review/rw6223681/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2020,Sickpuppy365,7," I love love and monsters
","Everyone involved in the making of this movie should be proud. Yes the plot is simple and it's been done many times in this genre and several others, like for instance The road, or The book of Eli or 28 days later... But in this case more like Zombieland if it was rated PG-13.
Dylan O'Brien plays Joel, a character much akin to Jesse Eisenberg's ""Columbus"", a kind of neurotic and unwilling protagonist out of his depth, who is rescued by Michael Rooker (playing Woody Harrelson's ""Tallahassee"") the grizzled survivalist with the adorable Minnow (Arianna Greenblatt playing Abigail Breslin's ""Little Rock"") in tow, whilst on a quest to find his love interest Aimee (the lovely Jessica Henwick playing Emma Stone's ""Wichita"")... Confusing?
Not really. It's a post-apocalyptic road trip monster filled action love story movie that is a romp and a riot.
It's not often you get to see a movie where even it's weakest link is still holding strong... The dialogue is witty, the scenery is beautiful but appropriate, CGI game is strong most of the time, and cinematography crisp & clear, no lightening cuts and shaky camera. All the cast brought their A-game.
Hero and Dodge lent so much emotion to their joint portrayal of ""Boy"" the dog, they both must be very good boys... and Mavis the robot could almost pass the Turing test.
You may have to suspend belief a bit in a couple scenes... But just remember you are watching a movie with giant frogs and snails and it shouldn't be too difficult. For me it's a 7 but a strong one.",/review/rw6223681/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2020,imlukem,9," I'd love a sequel.
","It's a lot like zombieland which is probebly one of my favourite films. The main character is not will smith or the rock, it's a skinny nobody. Dylan Obrien is amazing. The film is funny and the action is great. The monsters are also really cool. The dog is a badass. I'd love a sequel. more characters more worldbuilding stuff like that.",/review/rw6223681/?ref_=tt_urv

16 October 2020,cartathra,8," Family adventure
","It's not the most expensive movie, or the best plot but honestly this movie gave me flashbacks to the good old days of family adventure movies.
It has adventure, it has love, it has companionship, it has humour and it keeps you wanting to learn more about the world. It makes you feel good.",/review/rw6223681/?ref_=tt_urv

22 October 2020,paul_haakonsen,8," What a surprise of a movie...
","Right, well I had virtually no idea what I was getting into when I sat down to watch the 2020 movie ""Monster Problems"" (aka ""Love and Monsters""). But I must admit that I was genuinely interested in the movie given the presentation of the poster.",/review/rw6223681/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2020,poinla37,8," Entertaining and genuine
","This movie was fun to watch, the acting wasn't bad at all, CGI was decent.
Compared to Jumanji for example, which I found was a bit too much and overacted, this one is exactly what you would expect, but not too intense and forced.
Looking forward to a sequel.",/review/rw6223681/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2020,marmar-69780,7," Love and Monsters
","Love and Monsters was a fun film to see and it is actually after a some time a very fun new realease that surved its purpose and goals that it was trying to reach.Story was very inspiring and sweet at same time,it had some emotional moments and some romantic ones that were justified and that didnt felt rushed at any moment.Characters are also very likeable and i was able to root for them during entire runtime expecely towards the Dylan O Brien one,cause he was highlight of a entire film,special effects were also pretty solid and they done a good job to.Love and Monsters was a fun film to see for all families",/review/rw6223681/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2020,jonasatmosfera,9," No zombies!
","An apocalyptic film without zombies is worth its weight in gold these days.
The monster were kinda silly, but the story, the pace and the character were pretty good.
Filming locations were also great and different from the usual Hollywoodian sameness.
And, Thanks God, there were no ""in your face"" PC proselytism, which was refreshing.
Love and Monsters is the type of a film that a father can watch with his daughter or a mother with her and son and without feeling embarrassed most of the time.",/review/rw6223681/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2020,glenn_gallagher,8," I hope the Apocalypse is this fun !!!
",Really enjoyable movie and not as predictable as you'd think. I was surprised how funny and original 'Love and Monsters' was considering the overdone genre but it is an adventure worth taking. If you're looking for a decent weekend flick then I strongly recommend you give it a go.,/review/rw6223681/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2020,A_Different_Drummer,7," OBRIEN OBRIEN OBRIEN
","These hi-concept voice-over end of the world affairs do not always work, but the script here is smart enough to consistently play to basic human emotions and Obrien seems to have enough charm in the tank to power a battleship.",/review/rw6223681/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2020,nikos2,9," THAT was an unexpected kind of movie
","I was prepared for another boring to death movie flick, making questioning my taste on movies. I was surprised in a good way.
The movie had it all, great FX, good acting, Monsters, unseen twists, everything i needed for a Saturday night.",/review/rw6223681/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2020,lucas_mrz,6," A Sunday afternoon movie.
","This is your typical family friendly adventure movie. It has a plain, simple plot (and don't try to put it through the ""credibility test"", because it will fail miserably), predictable and cliched. There's not a lot of character development either. It has some humor (not very good), and some heartwarming moments (kinda...). Overall it's entertaining (considering it's intended for kids and teens), but forgettable.",/review/rw6223681/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2020,the_real_smile,7," Good movie, almost ruined by the childish script
","Yes, this is a very entertaining movie. A teenage boy survives a global disaster and is in hiding with other survivors in underground bunkers. Yet, he cannot get his girlfriend out of his head, luckily his girlfriend also survived, but is at a camp 126km from his camp. He takes the journey to go to his girlfriend fighting mutated cold blooded animals and insects. The mutants are great, very well done. What this movie almost brings down is the childish script and jokes, the main character, the teenage boy, is constantly denigrated for no reason, even a little girl he meets on his journey insults him only for a couple of poor executed jokes. But, all in all, this movie is worth your while.",/review/rw6223681/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am not sure if anyone is enjoying my riffs or how much sense some of the funny things I come up with as summary lines are making - or even if some consider them funny at all. Having said all that, the movie is funny. But even that can be judged differently by differnt individuals. The CGI work is really well done and the story is well thought of.",/review/rw6223681/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2021,ronakkotian,6," A fun and relaxing watch
