8 February 2012,yamaguchi-victor,6," Entertaining film for the family – and nothing more
","Journey 2: The Mysterious Island is the 'sequel' of Journey to the Centre of Earth (starring Brendan Fraser). Actually, I really don't know why they consider it a sequel because the story is completely different – the only similarities are the author of the books in which the films were based on (Jules Verne) and the character of Sean Anderson that appears in both movies. I also found interesting that many people didn't know it was related to the other movie.",/review/rw2566863/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2012,claudio_carvalho,4," When the Trailer Is Better than the Film
",The 17-year-old Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) receives a coded signal and his stepfather Hank (Dwayne Johnson) helps him to decipher the message. They find that Sean's grandfather Alexander Anderson (Michael Caine) has found the mysterious island in the Pacific described by Julio Verne and two other writers in their novels.,/review/rw2566863/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2012,Special-K88,," easy to watch but not particularly memorable
","Not so much a sequel as a new story altogether comes this likable (if unnecessary) adventure about Sean Anderson, a callow youth and ""Vernian"" who receives an encoded message then becomes obsessed with the idea that it was sent by his absentee grandfather who may or may not have discovered a mythical island that may or may not really exist. Accompanied by his stepfather, a frugal pilot, and the pilot's attractive daughter, Sean travels across the Pacific to the island where they encounter an assortment of wonders but just as many dangerous perils. Uninspired, fairly predictable, but Johnson and Caine add much needed gravitas, Guzmán his trademark comic relief, there's some good effects and exciting moments now and again, but a subplot about parents and their kids doesn't really resonate. A good family-oriented fare, just nothing special. **",/review/rw2566863/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2012,MosHr,6," Nice 3D and CGI. Awful characters to take a Journey with.
","""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"" is a blue-screen CGI extravaganza that is mixed in with the picturesque Hawaii locations, but containing a plot that is essentially all told in the trailer and presented with the dynamics of an amusement park tour. The ""2"" in ""Journey 2"" is because it is the sequel to the 2008 movie ""Journey to the Center of the Earth""; the ""The Mysterious Island"" in the title because both movies are both derived from books by Jules Verne.

8 January 2013,siderite,6," Not even attempting to be good
","Somewhere in Hollywood there are people who think children are morons and when they set up to make a kid movie, they do it starting with this premise. Morons they may be, but not in the sense their brains don't work well, but because they don't have enough experience. As such, this kind of films appear to me made for retarded (in the real sense of the word) people.",/review/rw2566863/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2012,rivertam26,6," Goofy Fun
","I hate to admit this. But I actually enjoyed this movie... I feel ashamed but it's a bit of goofy fun. Far superior to it's overlong, too silly predecessor this fun, energetic fantasy adventure movie keep things moving quickly. After a short but cool setup reintroducing us to the Josh Hutchinson character from the predecessor as he's escaping from some cops after breaking into a satellite station. He soon engages his stepfather played by The Rock and discovers a message from his grandfather about the mysterious island. Moving things along quickly they get there and it's filled wonders from giant lizards, mini elephants and sharks, giant bees they fly on, a gold filled volcano. All visualized in a bright, cheezy sort of CGI that is reminiscent of the 1950s monster, adventure flicks that inspired this one. Sadly, I skipped this in theaters but from what I've seen the 3D must have been pretty amazing. Of course not a lot of the movie makes much sense, but I think it's important to shut your brain off when watching it. it's a very entertaining popcorn flick. There a few laughs, some exciting action set pieces and even a little romance. And as for performances Michael Caine and The Rock leave a better impression than Brendan Frasier left in the first one, Vanessa Hudgens is fine in a supporting role and well Josh Hutchinson is looking pretty good. He's definitely a good actor and his movie star looks are starting to show. So all in all it's more fun than you'd expect ignore the cynics and go in with an open mind. 3.5/5",/review/rw2566863/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2012,torchos,8," Great movie, forgot the trollers here.

5 March 2012,jlj9675-1,4," silly unbelievability
","After seeing the trailers, I looked forward to this movie. But although I am a fan of Dwayne Johnson, I cannot recommend this movie to much of anyone. It moves too quickly at the beginning. The premise is interesting but completely implausible, especially the time frame. Some of the scenery is enjoyable but fleeting. Michael Caine's character is entirely too negative. The special effects were not very realistic either. The plot was designed to be a dramatic thriller but it was so pat it was boring. I almost left before the ending as there was no mystery left shortly into the film. Also, the two young people were rather lackluster and the pilot was annoying. For something that held so much promise of a lovely adventure, it was a big disappointment.",/review/rw2566863/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2012,sehook7,4," Not A Journey You Should Go On
","The previews for Journey 2: The Mysterious Island made it look better than it actually was. The movie was only slightly better than I was expecting. The premise for Journey 2 was good. I enjoyed the idea, but the movie was taken to a really cheesy level.",/review/rw2566863/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2012,dunfincin,2," the only mystery is why they made it
","I remember reading all of the Jules Verne books went I was a young teenager. Mind stretching, suspenseful and an utter delight. These books should be compulsory reading for all youngsters with a brain and some imagination but I suppose these days you would be happy enough to settle for a decent film of any of the books . This is not a decent film, in fact it's awful. A low calibre cast including the facially inert Rock, a nondescript Mexican who mugs his way through the film horribly and the usual teenage romance interest between the leading ""actor"" and a young girl otherwise completely superfluous to the story line. A wheezing, over acted and almost embarrassing pseudo cameo from Michael Caine and that's about it.(Oh Michael,surely you must have made enough money by now) A lot of CGI of course to cover up the lame acting, schoolboy script and fatuous dialogue. A complete failure on every level. A travesty in fact. I can't imagine any young teenager watching this film and having his or her imagination fired up to the extent that they couldn't wait to read the entire Verne collection which is a great shame.",/review/rw2566863/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2012,Anurag-Shetty,8," Much better than the first!
","Four years back, when Journey To The Center Of The Earth released I didn't watch it in the first weekend itself. However, when I did watch it I thoroughly enjoyed it! So, when I heard that Journey 2: The Mysterious Island was releasing I was naturally excited! So, Journey 2 continues with the adventures of the Anderson family. Reprising his role from the first movie, Josh Hutcherson returns as Sean Anderson(the only main character to return from the first movie). Sean, thinks his granddad(Michael Caine), who has been missing for many years, is on the mythical island called The Mysterious Island. So, he makes up his mind to go there. However, step dad Hank(Dwayne Johnson) has always been looking for an opportunity to spend some quality time with his stepson who doesn't really like him much. So, both of them fly to Palau, the area where the island is supposed to be located. So, two people, a father & his daughter agree to fly them to the supposed location of The Mysterious Island. So, after they crash & they discover The Mysterious Island, the adventure begins. Big animals that become small & small animals that become big. They discover the impossible & witness extraordinary things! The island looks even better in 3D! It's like the moviegoer is on the island with the gang! A note, on the performances. Dwayne Johnson does a respectable job, as Hank. Josh Hutcherson is impressive as Sean Anderson. He'll be an actor to look forward to in the coming years. Michael Caine is brilliant as Grandpa Anderson! Luiz Guzman is spectacular as Gabato, the only character to provide constant comic relief in the film. Vanessa Hudgens is effective as Kailani. So, I would like to conclude by saying, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island is worth a watch, especially in 3D! Can't wait for Journey 3!",/review/rw2566863/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2012,sk_razor,3," An actual viewer opinion - Not even kids worthy.
","I cant spoil the story as there is barely any to find.  The only one/s who truly earned any coin in this movie are the people  who did the trailer, because they managed to put together a clip from  the none existent content of the film.  Suffice to say, I can bet you the 80 million dollars to that took to  make this film that first graders and/or some random drunken people in  a bar can come with a better screen play.  Its so bad that you can see everyone of the actors in the film can not  believe they are actually going through with this scene after scene.  Its so excessively dull that I wouldn't even want my children to see  it.  The ONLY thing you can do to make this film bare-able is to turn of the  audio and watch it as a mute film. Anything you could imagine about the  dialog would be better.  I'm only giving it a 3 because believe it or not I've seen worse ( :  And CGI? Maybe we could have enjoyed the CGI if it wasn't crushingly  burdened with carrying the dumbest dialog I've seen in years.  I'm only wasting my key taps on this ""film"" on the off chance that this  will save someone the waste of time.",/review/rw2566863/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2012,jantoniou,2," Just really, really bad...

18 January 2012,DICK STEEL,4," A Nutshell Review: Journey 2: The Mysterious Island
","Journey to the Center of the Earth was one of the earliest 3D movies in this recent revival of what would already be the very tired 3D gimmick that has been invading our theatres, especially when films take the easy way out to convert to 3D during post production just to milk a few more bucks out of a weary audience. And this weariness now extends to this sequel with only cast member Josh Hutcherson returning as Sean Anderson, in a follow up story that's loosely set in yet another Jules Verne novel called The Mysterious Island.",/review/rw2566863/?ref_=tt_urv

If its only there for X time, how is all that stuff still on there animal & building wise. Still entertaining, but they really didn't think this through...",/review/rw2566863/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2013,g-bodyl,9," A Fun Adventure!
","Journey 2: A Mysterious Island, the sequel to the 2008 hit film is a fun, adventurous film that all members of the family can enjoy. Personally, I find it to be better than the first film even though somehow the general consensus appear to disagree. I liked the new additions to the cast since they seemed to bolster the film. I liked some of the island's natives we see such as the enormous bumblebees.",/review/rw2566863/?ref_=tt_urv

","We have our first contender for ""Worst Movie of the Year."" I doubt it will get the title, but it'll be close. Journey 2 lacks every element of film-making. The acting is dreadful. The storyline is flat and linear. The special effects are extremely bad. Everything about this movie is forced.
