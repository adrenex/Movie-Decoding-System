19 March 2022,davek28,7," Not so bad, really
","Love Tuppence Middleton but not a fan of one trick pony Martin Compston so I was a bit trepidacious about embarking on this, especially as I rarely watch any ITV programmes.",/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2022,iainsmith-18061,4," Ok
",It started out really great and was really intriguing. I was so looking forward to the last episode to see what happens but what a let down . The ending was RUBBISH . Really felt let down by the ending. It was great until then.,/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2022,michael-1151,5," Nice house, lame plot
","Martin Compson and Tuppence Middleton with their two sons in a lovely early Edwardian house would have made a good 2 point 2 children comedy couple. Sadly, as a dramatic pair, they don't cut the mustard.",/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2022,comps-784-38265,1," 'Our House' great foundations but no roof !
",This was a similar experience to that when watching the Apple Sci Fi series Invasion.,/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2022,simon1963,5," Great, then average, then rubbish!
","Really unusual and original start, which made me eagerly watch episode 2/4. Started to go downhill mid-way through this episode, and by the final part, I was close to turning it off before it ended. The ending was complete nonsense and totally farcical. Love Perry-Jones and Compston in other productions, but this....uuugghh!!",/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2022,craiglesuk-1,1," No stars
","This is possibly the worst thing I've seen on tv without giving up half way. There are absolutely no redeeming features to this. The plot is ludicrous, the script might have been written by teenagers and (perhaps because of this) the acting from all concerned is atrocious. Tuppence, Martin & Rupert, people I've loved in other things, were embarrassingly bad. How this ever got made is the real mystery here.",/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,irnbru-333,5," Dull melodrama with mismatched leads
","On the plus side the production values were nice and it looked great, though a few more light bulbs would have been good - do all interiors have to be shot in cave like darkness all the time these days?",/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2022,bosporan,4," Tedious and drawn out
","Episode 1 was good laying out the story frame. Found it intriguing - episode 2 did not add enough, by three it had nothing. Original idea wasted. The whole point of UK drama having fewer episodes than US drama is that the content is rich and concentrated - now we have short and dilute - not a good bargain.",/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2022,silentbod,4," Just... pointless.
","As others have said, episode 1 was very good and left me intrigued as to where the story would go next. But it didn't go anywhere. All the drama and tension fizzled out over the next 2 episodes. By the time ep4 came on I was already done. Just as well as the ending was terrible too.",/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2022,miriampye-56522,2," So many plot holes
",I wanted to like this. Husband away with work for a few days & I needed a good drama but oh dear.. I'm so annoyed by this series!,/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2022,rupturedspleen,4," Interesting start, strange middle and disappointing end
","This was an unusual if unlikely story idea, but has been executed poorly.",/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2022,fierackas,2," Poor so Poor
","Really poor drama with a silly implausible story, naff acting, and daft characters - I would suggest avoiding it unless you are a masochist or need a cure for insomnia.",/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,annabelle-71667,2," Unbelievably bad
",How bad can It get this is by far one of the worst things I have seen on tv lately the story line is totally unbelievable and as for Buket Komur with out doubt the most dreadful actress to hit out tv screens so far when an actor is this bad they should not be allowed to work there are some really great people out there wanting work.,/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2022,SurreyReviewsUK,1," Predictable, slow and dull dross
","There was me thinking Trigger Point was awful, this barely makes it to the same level of dross. If you like your 'drama' obvious to the point of insulting and your acting wooden then you will love this. The cast was abysmal and the plot was basic. To call this a psychological drama is flipping ridiculous. Would give it 0/10 but you have to pick 1/10 as a minimum. Avoid.",/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,julianbevans,4," How on earth do they afford that house?
","Not so much a review of a mediocre 'thriller', more a crit on UK TV drama as a whole. It seems to me that we're trying to impress foreign audiences with a perceived standard of living that is totally unreal. A house like this Edwardian gem would be worth what... Â£1,000,000 in London? Not far off it at any rate. How on earth could these chumps afford that? Left in a will? Lottery winners? Drug lords? This is not a one-off either. Loads of these middle class thrillerettes spring up with factory production line regularity... and they all live in sodding architect-designed masterpieces in the country, or Tudor relics, stately mansions or six bedroomed gated community horrors. Life just isn't like this for most people. I literally turn off when I see things heading in this direction. 'Happy Valley'... now that's realistic. Real people living real lives in normal houses. Who are we trying to impress? Like I said... there's an eye on foreign markets here - look at the lovely UK... they all shop at Waitrose, have bean-to-cup machines in echoing marble worktop kitchens and their kids have bedrooms that double for conference venues. Jeez. Give me a break. Get real!",/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2022,evans-15475,8," Good till end
","I enjoyed this until the Contrived ending,has anyone ever put the entire plot into a suicide note how could you expect to get away with saying you didn't know your boyfriend of months and actually been in a hotel with him the night before,",/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2022,Sleepin_Dragon,8," An intriguing series.
","A woman returns home, to find her husband has sold their house, and vanished.",/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2022,ricabailey,1," Utter utter tosh
",Farcical premise. Obviously the first thing someone would do if they came home to find their house had been sold without their knowledge is speak to their solicitor! If their signature was forged then its not a legal sale. Plus a signature on a house salecontract has to be witnessed. So simple to see who witness was as they must put their details. What a totally stupid plot.,/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2022,jmwebb-77444,3," Oh dear...
","What a shame. I was really looking forward to watching this and episode 1 set the scene for what looked like an excellent drama. But then it just went downhill. Totally unbelievable that someone would actually sell their house and put all their items into storage over what? A video on a phone? And all without his wife knowing! And then having done all this, he kills himself anyway! Had all the chances of being a great tense drama but let down by an awful storyline with a terrible ending.",/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2022,Gav-7,2," Terrible acting
",I found this to be very disappointing the lead actress Tuppence Middleton is wooden and unbelievable as the character. She totally ruined the series. I really wanted to like it after reading the book.,/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,johnlett,2," Dross
",Just where does itv get this stuff from. Would have beennn 1/10 if it wasnt for the cliffhanger at the end. How can itv keep churning out such drab boring drama?,/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,bzwfd,1," Ridiculous nonsense
","What a load of nonsense Our House is. Plot holes everywhere. From a road rage incident somehow meant to believe they worked out who Bram was, that he was separated, owned a huge house, where he drinks and wife works and then get them both into bed! Ridiculous.",/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2022,horus-12D,1," Just really lazy
","It is hard to find good things to say. I wanted to because there are some good actors here. However, good actors need good directors and good scripts. Everything is missing and this is a totally farcical, unbelievable mess.",/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2022,kevinmorrissey-62038,1," Over 3 hours of my life I won't get back
","Actually fell out with my wife for making me watch it..
The story was terrible, random annoying characters. Totally unrealistic and holes all over the plot.",/review/rw7936873/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2022,jp-cadden92,3," Our house well and truly written by the madness!
