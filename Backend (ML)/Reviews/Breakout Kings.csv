25 October 2020,pfne,4," Mixed up, confused and kind of all over the place..
",It supposed to be a thriller about a boy being kidnapped. But it's tonaly all over the place. There's moments I'd swear were going for comedy. The ott magicians are too light for a thriller. The shockingly dodgy wigs and facial hair trying to deage people back to the 90s and then having a young guy playing an old guy in a wheel chair. David Cronnenbergs whole performance was a laughable mess too.,/review/rw6485504/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2020,deloudelouvain,6," Too bad they got a bit lazy by the end.
","This movie kept my interest and attention for the entire duration so that's a positive thing. However I like mystery movies with a clear ending, an ending where I don't have to guess what really happened. I want clear answers on every question I have and unfortunately this was not the case with this movie. It felt like they couldn't be bothered to make it a nice ending, there were also some elements they completely neglected by the end and you start to wonder why they even brought them up during the movie. So to me whilst it was entertaining it clearly could and should have been better. Mysteries should start with an intriguing beginning, continue with a suspenseful middle, and end with the mystery completely solved, that's how a mystery movie is the most effective and that's how the gems in this genre are made. All in all the acting wasn't bad, the story was interesting, the cinematography was also okay but still it's a missed opportunity to make it a movie that stands out from the rest.",/review/rw6485504/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2020,lopezpatricia-06139,5," WARNING EXTREME SPOILERS I.E IM GONNA TELL YOU THE END
",Not the worst film I've ever seen. The acting was solid and good performance. However I'm all about the endings and the closure of a film. At the end it's clear that the murdered boy is still alive as he turns up in the final scene as an adult. So did he survive the falls. Or are all the accused innocent. Was the one eyed man in the final scene just a coincidence . If so where had he been all these years. Totally pee's me off to be left such questions. And guess the end of a film really annoys me.,/review/rw6485504/?ref_=tt_urv

14 November 2021,gallagherkellie,4," Silly movie
","This wasn't very good. The acting was fine. The beginning was good and had me expecting something great but it went downhill. It was a little confusing, very unbelievable, comical and I'm not sure if it was meant to be.",/review/rw6485504/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2022,phenomynouss,3," i don't know
","Watching this film reminds me intensely of an supposed quote from Herodotos about the Spartans. The Samians sent a delegation to Sparta to plead for help and assistance with a very long, rather dull speech. The Spartans told the delegation that the speech had been so long that they forgot the first half of the speech and could thus make no sense of the second half.",/review/rw6485504/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2020,Pairic,7," Conspiracy Thriller
","Disappearance At Clifton Hill: Abby (Tuppence Middleton) returns to her home town on the death of her mother; against her sister's wishes she tries to keep the family motel running. Abby also has dark memories of the kidnapping of a boy she witnessed 25 years before. The problem is that Abby is a pathological liar so unsurprisingly the police and her sister are reluctant to believe this late report. Abby meets up with a local Conspiracy podcaster Walter (David Cronenberg) who believes that a local rich family were behind this and other disappearances. The supposed conspiracy also involves animal trainers. You will begin to question conflicting narratives as this tale unfolds. Some great scenes. we first encounter Cronenberg as he rises from a river pond beneath Niagara Falls, he's also a sort of mudlark diver. Directed/Co-Written by Albert Shin. On Netflix. 7/10.",/review/rw6485504/?ref_=tt_urv

","The atmosphere is great, the story captivating, with tension building up. Unfortunately, things get messed up with the main character's backstory. I still didn't get the ending of this movie. Anyone to help me understand who actually did what ? i cannot find any answer online as everyone else seems to be confused...",/review/rw6485504/?ref_=tt_urv

","Abby West (Tuppence Middleton) returns to her hometown of Niagara Falls after her mother's death. She and her sister Laure inherit the rundown family motel. Laure wants to sell it right away. Abby is dealing with a childhood trauma which is keeping her psychologically stunted. While on a family fishing trip downstream from the falls at the age of seven, she alone witnessed a possible kidnapping.

31 October 2021,kimmaree-76626,5," What just happened?
","Ok seemed promising and was ok to wile away a Sunday afternoon. This is not scary nor a thriller. It bobs along with little dialogue. I wanted more talk! Good acting especially by the lead actress, but the ambiguity was frustrating. I think if I was 7 and just saw a kid kidnapped I'd run back to my parents screaming. Abby says nothing. Maybe she was in shock but...
The parents of the kidnapped boy couldn't care less about anything, nor that their tiger was mauling their son. Just saying he was weak? Uggh
The supposed abuser was actually innocent but still acted weird. Ended up being the boys saviour from the crazy parents. I had to rewind at the end because things happened so fast all of a sudden. Police bust in and arrest the kidnapper, woke me up after a slow paced film. Then Abby is working in a motel, and a man comes in with an eyepatch who we assume is Alex (the boy) grown up. But didn't they find his body? Don't know. Again, stilted convo and ambiguous. And he says ""Do we know each other?""
Ummm oh yes! I am recognisable from when I'm 7yrs old omg. Alex/Al goes to his room and that's it?? Uggh
Ok I get it was a Noir Film. But the screenwriter didn't have much work to do. Instead people just looking at each other all the time. When there were conversations, they weren't normal. Stilted and ambiguous. The premise was good or could've been if they weren't shooting for such a dark film and yes in the dark also. Anyway is ok if you have a spare 90 mins.",/review/rw6485504/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2022,chet19,4," Wait, so who are the bad guys?
","So the magicians thought their son was a wimp. Not a crime. Bev Mole kidnapped the kid, but why she locks up her husband with a literal lock and chain in a closet is never explained. Charlie Lake should be about the same age as the missing Alex, but they hint at Charlie being abusive to the kid, as if it were an adult/kid abuse instead of two young classmates. The magicians originally thought the whining liar protagonist was gonna blackmail them. With what? ""I know your son was afraid of tigers, so give me money""? A messy poorly written waste.",/review/rw6485504/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2020,TwistedContent,6," Intriguing and Atmospheric though Not Fully Realized Modern Noir
","The third (but first recognized) directional feature by Albert Shin, ""Disappearance at Clifton Hill"", provides a subtle but effective slow-burning small town mystery / psychological drama / modern noir thriller, albeit one that's potential is only half realized. With great attention for detail (and a little less for the bigger picture), competent performances, intriguing setting & atmospheric cinematography and sound design ""Disappearance at Clifton Hill"" should please the fans of oddball indie thrillers.",/review/rw6485504/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2020,charlie-60651,7," Good twist...spoiler alert
","My take on the ending...the twist was that the boy Alex didn't really get killed by the so called paedophile/parents/tigers. The ""paedo"" / Charlie was the one who saved Alex from his parents/tigers and got Alex away from a life that probably would have ended up with him getting killed. Not sure if it's the right ending but I like it.",/review/rw6485504/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2020,varun-25071997,8," Worth It!
","A chilling disappearance mystery which explores how biases and prejudices kill an investigation effectively. The Niagara Falls setting was perfect for the film and using an off season tourist setting gives us a good outlook of how the mood of a small town with dark secrets would look like. Really loved watching David Cronenberg onscreen as a podcaster, despite his limited screen time you wish you could see him in more movies. The twist is quite brutal and shocking, you definitely wouldn't see it coming.",/review/rw6485504/?ref_=tt_urv
