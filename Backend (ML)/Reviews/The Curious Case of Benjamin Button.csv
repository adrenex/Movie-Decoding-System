1 February 2020,CriticalOfEverything,10," The first film I've seen in years that has deeply affected me.
","This may get a little personal, but I've been suffering from severe depression and have had a lot of issues dealing with anger, sadness and all for about five years now. For the past 8 years of my life, and earlier years of my childhood, I have loved Fred Rogers. He always told me and millions of children all over the world that he likes us just the way we are, and taught us the power of kindness, positive ways of thinking and dealing with our emotions, and while I'll always be a cynic by nature, I've always tried to take what he taught me and many others to heart. He was genuinely the kindest, most loving and compassionate human being to ever grace this Earth. But over the past year especially, I've stopped caring about my life with tragedy happening around me constantly, making me feel like my life was falling apart, as well as me having thoughts of suicide. I always put Mr Rogers on to give me some kind of motivation to keep going, but his messages that once resonated so deeply with me began to fade as I slipped further and further away from being ""fine"". I've gotten a lot better over the past few months though, not perfect but still, and when I heard that a movie starring Tom Hanks as Mr Rogers was being made I did all that I could to see it as fast as possible when it finally came out in the UK (which as of writing this, was yesterday).",/review/rw6051309/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2020,planktonrules,9," Very intelligently crafted....just make sure you have some Kleenex nearby!
","I should warn you about ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"", the film might be difficult for some viewers. This is because the story is about a troubled relationship between a man and his father...and it may trigger a lot of personal issues for you as well. Now I am NOT saying don't watch it....just be prepared that it might just be tough for you if you are struggling with these sorts of personal issues. And, you might want to have some Kleenex nearby...and perhaps a loved one as well.",/review/rw6051309/?ref_=tt_urv

19 November 2019,jlthornb51,10," Stunning Tom Hanks Performance
","A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a superb film and one of the most wonderful movie going experiences of my life. Mr. Tom Hanks gives what is nothing less than the performance of a lifetime. Simply incredible. Subtly and with artistry and sensitivity Mr. Hanks becomes Fred Rogers and it's as if the actor himself disappears. Beautifully written and wonderfully directed, this is a motion picture that will live in the hearts of audiences for generations to come. Tom Hanks will rip your heart out and return it to you filled with love and understanding. This is an historic acting accomplishment in a film that will become an instant classic.",/review/rw6051309/?ref_=tt_urv

I have adored Mister Rogers since I was a young girl & I didn't like the idea of someone else playing him.

","It was a movie about Mr. Rogers so how could I not go see it? From birth until about the age of ten Mr. Rogers and Sesame Street were my primary T.V. programs. Sure, they were supplemented at times by Reading Rainbow, Romper Room, and other PBS shows, but Mr. Rogers and Sesame Street were the staples.",/review/rw6051309/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2019,gsygsy,8," Thoughtful and textured
","This could so easily have been sentimental Hollywood pap about settling family feuds. Instead, it's a thoughtful, textured contemplation of how we can effectively deal with our expectations, disappointments and imperfections. It is true, as others have pointed out, that the female roles are ciphers, which might be considered a surprising weakness in a film directed by a woman. Nonetheless, Marielle Heller, who did such an excellent job on CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME? also steers this movie superbly, handling the performances and the screenplay's playful shifts of tone with great assurance.",/review/rw6051309/?ref_=tt_urv

",I.......I don't have any words. I love this movie. I.....I just don't know what to say. I never thought this movie makes me want to be like Mr. Rogers.This film is just beautiful. This film makes me want to cry. He was a man who was nothing but pure heart. I saw his TV shows and all of them are beautiful. I cried about everything in this movie. I just couldn't stop crying. I love the fact that Tom Hanks did nothing but a phenomenal job doing Fred Rogers. Everything about this movie I had no complains. This movie makes ME FEEL something.....HAPPINESS. I LOVE this movie. I don't know what to say this movie was made for Mr. Rogers himself. Please go watch this movie. Please give this money so the studio can do more movies like this. The Director needs to do more movies like this. Even if you saw it already see it again. This movie is beautiful. Please. Support a movie like this. Please I LOVE THIS movie near dear to my heart. I never cared about watching action movies or cared about racing or people with powers. I care about people being PEOPLE. I hope Mr Rogers watches this in heaven and not only appreciate it. But will say that was what the neighborhood made for me. (Trust me I think he will be more than just proud). 10/10,/review/rw6051309/?ref_=tt_urv

8 March 2020,Cineanalyst,8," Neighborhood Reflections
","I didn't grow up with Mister Rogers and so have no nostalgia for the subject of ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,"" and I tend to resist sentimental stories such as this one, but this is a clever and well-constructed piece of filmmaking, especially for a sidelong-glance biopic revolving around a magazine article about a host of a children's television show. Indeed, the writer begins with a puff-piece assignment, but winds up writing a feature mostly about himself. Most of the movie concerns the writer receiving informal therapy from Fred Rogers over his daddy issues instead of interviewing his subject. In a sense, the movie, then, is the one he writes within the very picture itself. It's a nice, if hardly original, construction reflecting the authorship of the narrative, which itself concerns a writer reflecting back upon himself. Director Marielle Heller's last picture, ""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" (2018) was likewise about a writer. Yet, the narrative is also framed within the TV program of ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,"" and this is where it gets wonderfully creative--not unlike the real TV show, it would seem, which is full of song and music, videos within a Van Gogh painting, puppetry and the fourth-wall-breaking address of Rogers to the audience by directly looking into the camera.",/review/rw6051309/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2019,CubsandCulture,10," Can You Say...Wonderful?
","I think people should know that going into this film that it is not really a biopic of Fred Rogers. He isn't even the main character. If you are looking for a film that is much more about the man's life ""Won't You Be My Neighbor?"" is the better fit. This film is more about how Fred Roger's worldview really helped out a reporter work through some interpersonal baggage. On that level it is a wonderful exquisitely humane story of one human helping another. Rogers' radical decency is demonstrated in this film; in all its facets as well. Lloyd's struggles with how Rogers *is* just feel correct. Rhys gives a striking performance of Llyod that has a quiet power to it. This is the sort of very mature drama that is missing from the cinemas. It is a wholesome film and I think Rogers would be very appreciative of it",/review/rw6051309/?ref_=tt_urv

","Extremely clever combination of collective creativity and believable facts, brilliantly stuffed into just one film.
* Clever : how to present the life works of multigenerational figure into a single story and still tell the truth.
* Believable : nothing could be more credible than Tom Hanks doing his best to be Mr. Rogers while getting to know his new neighbor; a hard boiled investigative journalist.
So many of life's questions, get straight forward and coherent answers for all of us. Whether we have parents or not. Simple common sense is a gift that Tom Hanks passes successfully from Mr. Rogers, to the child and parent in all of us. Thanks Rogers & Hanks.",/review/rw6051309/?ref_=tt_urv
