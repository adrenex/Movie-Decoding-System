","It took me a while to watch 'Insidious' and its follow ups, with so much going on with my studies and commitments and with an ever growing watch and review list. Decided to finally watch them all, with the intent of reviewing the latest film as part of my quest to see as many 2018 films as possible and wanting to see how it compared with the previous outings. Also with an appreciation, if not quite undying love, for horror.",/review/rw2871396/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2013,Ramascreen,," Scary Fun
","We horror fans have been spoiled this past year, we've had it good  because director James Wan brought us The Conjuring and now Insidious:  Chapter 2, if this film had been any scarier, the world may stop  spinning, it is that scary. It's terrifying but it's also fun because  of that Ghostbuster-esque duo with their mormon missionary type outfit  on, who return to once again provide the humor for this franchise. But  seriously, James Wan has mastered this genre and made it his own. To  me, Wan is like this generation's Dario Argento. Wan and screenwriter  Leigh Whannell prove to be a winning team and they've brought us a  sequel that's just as good or even better than the first film.  Now, I'm going to try to do this review without spoiling details, and  it's going to be hard but I'm going to try to the best of my ability.  INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 takes us back to The Lamberts who went through  basically hell over their son's essence being trapped in this realm  called The Further. Now, what's extremely cool about how Wan and Leigh  crafted this sequel in that they play it in a way that this realm The  Further becomes a connection, a bridge between the first and this  second movie. There would be little instances like a door suddenly  opens by itself in the first film, and this sequel shows you why the  door did that. There are countless sequels out there that try hard to  expand on something while begging audiences to check out the first film  again, but the way that is done in INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 is clever.  Folks who've seen the first movie would be amused, folks who haven't  seen it would practically beg to watch the first movie after they're  done viewing this sequel, and all of it much thanks to this realm that  Wan and Leigh created, anything can happen in it, you can travel  through time, you can travel through places, ghosts can get you there,  and you can even get trapped in it, it's like a zone or a dimension  that probably Rod Serling himself would wish he had thought of it.  James Wan is a great horror director because he knows exactly what  scares you. That idea that somebody may be there watching when you  can't really see anybody there at all. It's that uneasy feeling that  slowly but surely creeps up on you and then strikes you in a heartbeat  without mercy, it's that old ghostly tale told by some kind of expert  who has gone through the experience years prior, Wan knows exactly  which elements that would not only scare you but would also leave you  scared long after the movie's done. INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 offers all  that and a bag of chips, one can even call this movie, INSIDIOUS: The  Origin Of The Bride In Black. While they're dealing with what may or  may not have happened to Patrick Wilson's character, they discover a  certain backstory that explains the motivation for the Bride In Black.  While a certain past or a certain childhood is a dealt with and as they  try to close the chapter on The Lamberts, they open a new way to a  possibility of the team of experts going to another family, because  this is a world where The Further has taken the front seat, it has  become the lead star and the face of this franchise. I think INSIDIOUS:  CHAPTER 2 won't disappoint the fans, and I guarantee you'll have a  jolly good fright at the theaters.",/review/rw2871396/?ref_=tt_urv

","After the death of Elise, Renai (Rose Byrne) is interrogated by a police detective about the supernatural events in the house. While the police investigate the house, the Lambert family temporarily moves to the old house of Lorraine Lambert (Barbara Hershey). Renai is haunted by a woman in white and Josh (Patrick Wilson) has a strange behavior at home. Meanwhile Lorraine seeks out Elise's partners Specs (Leigh Whannell) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) expecting to find answers and who killed Elise, and they summon the medium Carl (Steve Coulter) to contact Elise using his dices. The name of the hospital where Lorraine worked appears and they go to the place that is abandoned. They walk to a room that was the ICU and Lorraine recalls an incident with the terminal patient Parker Crane (Tom Fitzpatrick) that committed suicide in the hospital. They find his address, and discloses that the hideous serial- killer ""The Bride in Black"" was Parker indeed. Further, Lorraine believes that her son Josh is trapped in the Further and Parker has possessed his body. Carl, Specs and Tucker go to Lorraine's house and find that Lorraine's assumption is correct. How can they bring Josh back to his body?",/review/rw2871396/?ref_=tt_urv

14 September 2013,DustinRahksi,4," Cash grab? probably.
","The Wan hype train is rolling through this film, there for it will make a lot of money just because of The Conjuring. I don't hate James Wan, I just hate the people that d**k ride his films, probably because horror is complete trash now-a-days, and this is the closest thing people see as good horror. But in reality, it's mediocre and nothing special. The Conjuring was a well made film, but it was downright horrible in every other category, including the most important thing, atmosphere/scares. Luckily this film was more of a thriller than it was a horror film, they recycled the exact some scares from the first film. I'll explain.",/review/rw2871396/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2013,Big_D_Box_Office_Score,7," James Wan continues his streak of solid horror flicks, and improves on Chapter 1.
","Insidious brought us the usual haunting story, with a couple new  elements sprinkled in. Chapter 2 does a great job of furthering itself  from the usual fare, by expanding on the elements that made it  different.  One on the elements of this franchise is the focus on ""Astral  Projection"", which is a person subconsciously leaving his/her body and  traveling though a spirit realm (called the ""Further"" in this movie),  leaving the body empty until the soul returns. While projecting, the  soul can interact with other spirits, good and bad. Chapter 2 picks  right up from where the first ended (SPOILER FOR THE 1ST MOVIE! SKIP TO  NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID!) - the father succeeds in rescuing his son's  soul, but something else has taken the father's body in the process.   Is it as scary as the first? That's debatable...if you liked the scares  from the first movie, then you'll get a kick out of some of the  tension- filled moments in this one. If you weren't a fan, then it'll  probably just be more of the same. My opinion - slightly fewer scary  moments, but definitely a few quality jumps, perhaps of a higher  quality than the first. (There's one 3-hit combo in particular that I  thought was really good.)  I will say that I enjoyed how the total story has evolved. Chapter 2  adds a few layers to the lore of this franchise that sparked my  interests, and gives it some good depth. The script is infinitely  better this time around. Patrick Wilson outdoes his previous  performance, and I love anything that Barbara Hershey does. We even get  a few laughs here and there. And James Wan does well to use the  'common-sense-as-viewers- applied-in-the-movie' technique again.  Without giving anything away...when you get a blatant warning, YOU  LISTEN TO IT.  Sound editing was much better this time around, although they still  rely a good amount on the usual dead silence broken by LOUD CRASHES OF  NOISE AND CREEPY MUSIC...  Overall, Chapter 2 makes several improvements on the first, and while,  depending on your tastes, this sequel may or may not be as scary as the  first, I think it's tough to deny that this is a all-around better,  more entertaining movie. And, being such a low-risk, low-budget  project, I'm sure a 3rd movie will be justified.  Insidious: Chapter 2 scores a 3.5 out of 5 on the BDBOS.",/review/rw2871396/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2013,bendy392,4," Scares over sense.
","Insidious: Chapter 2, the sequel to the 2011 hit Insidious and directed by the same guy, James Wan. This is...um...less than the first...but I'm not sure if that makes it good...for me at least.",/review/rw2871396/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2013,jaguiar313,," Insidious sequel is spooky fun.
","Insidious: Chapter 2 starts up almost right after the original Insidious ended with Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne) Lambert reunited with their son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) after his spirit was held prisoner by a demon in an afterlife dimension called 'The Further'. But, as we saw in the final frames, something else was now inhabiting Josh's body and it had strangled paranormal investigator Elise (Lin Shaye) to death. We pick up as the unsuspecting family, including older son Foster (Andrew Astor) and their infant daughter Kali, have moved in with Josh's mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) while police investigate Elise's mysterious death in their house. They are barely moved in when supernatural occurrences start to begin again with objects moving, spectral voices, apparitions appearing and dear old dad acting very strange. While Renai tries to deal with the fact that supernatural forces are still with them, Josh tries to convince her all is well and Lorraine decides to team up with Elise's former assistants paranormal investigators Specs (Leigh Whannell who also wrote the screenplay) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) along with one of the original investigators from Josh's childhood haunting, Carl (Steve Coulter) to get down to the bottom of these haunted hi-jinx once and for all. And that is all I will say about the story as, despite some familiar trappings, James Wan (The Conjuring) takes this installment in some clever directions and once again uses the familiar elements very well. We get to know the story behind the evil woman in black seen in the last film and even revisit The Further though, this time it is inventively linked to events in the first film. The pace is a bit slower and more methodical this time round but, since this film is a bit of a mystery as well as haunting, it takes it's time to let the story unfold and secrets be revealed. We still get some spooky scenes but, it is refreshingly mixed in with Lorraine and co's equally goose bump inducing investigation. And what they find is deviously fun. The film is not quite as lively as Insidious part one but, I liked the mystery element and the film earned points with me for using it's return to 'The Further' a bit more clever and less silly then last time. That is the point where the first film lost it's grip on me and here I like how it was done and was with this supernatural chiller up to the spooky end. Wan is a good director and he takes what could have been a ho-hum retread and makes it a fun follow-up. He gets good performances out of all his cast and while I found Patrick Wilson to be bland in both Insidious and The Conjuring, he gets a far more lively performance out of him here. He gets to ham it up a bit and it suits him. The film has some beautiful and creepy visuals, as is Wan's trademark, and Joseph Bishara's score adds some nice atmosphere too. So in conclusion, while the story elements are more familiar; we've seen some of it before and the pace a bit slower, Wan does give us a spooky mystery to add to the paranormal activity and makes much more clever use of his otherworldly 'Further'. He also gives us some clever answers to the questions left by his first Insidious and that all adds up to a spooky fun time at the movies. Also stars House Of The Devil's Joceline Donahue as young Lorraine in some equally clever flashback sequences that tie into the rest of the film in a fun way.",/review/rw2871396/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2013,puppycupcake,10," If you were a fan of the first, you will love the second installment
","The movie picks up right where the first left off, and really gives you the back story of the family and why they are going through everything they are going through. They style is very similar, and there is so much originality and style that you just don't see with today's modern horror story flicks. There are plenty of scares, plot twists, surprises, a-ha moments, and plenty of tense moments and horror. I really enjoyed it just as much as the first. I got to see The Ultimate Insidious Experience which was a back to back double feature which was really cool to refresh what had happened in the first. There are moments that explain cleverly scenes that didn't make sense in the beginning but are cleverly resolved in the end. I have always loved the first Insidious and the second is equally as good in my book. If you didn't like the first, you won't like the second. It's just a great spooky, scary, haunted house, ghost, abandoned hospital story that is well-done and leaves you very satisfied at the end. They leave it open for further sequels that are sure to follow. A definite must-see for any horror movie fan.",/review/rw2871396/?ref_=tt_urv

","When you are making a horror movie it always helps to have a few things around in the movie in order to help set the mood. Things like creaky old doors, a piano, and preferably an old and creepy looking house. Now these are not absolutes, but they can help for sure. Horror movies are not like other movies, because there are so many possibilities for sequels, just look at the ""Friday the 13th"" series. In 2011 James Wan and Leigh Whannell brought us ""Insidious"", a story about a family that had unwelcome visitors in their house. The supernatural kind. ",/review/rw2871396/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2014,zach-tiefling,2," A wonderful breakdown of modern horror...
","""Insidious – Chapter 2"" takes place right after the events of the first movie. In order to bring the audience up to speed, it opens up with 15 minutes of purposely stilted exposition. But not only those first minutes are a true gem of writing! Dialogues throughout the movie will fascinate every viewer, in how far removed they are from actual human speech and emotion. To emphasize this disconnection from the human condition, all lines are delivered by a group of wooden mannequins cleverly disguised as actors. Although this has been a bold choice by the director, the expression known as 'dull surprise' is always spot on. ",/review/rw2871396/?ref_=tt_urv

","All week I was digging around trying to find critics' reviews about this to see what they thought at their early screenings. Well, it wasn't good, and I was feeling let down already. They all basically said the same thing; that the jump and scare moments were plenty, but that's about it. The story is too convoluted and it just isn't as good as the first one. Also, there is too much humor and wit in it, and it takes away from the tension buildup. But would that stop me from seeing it first chance I get Thursday night? As a die-hard of demon movies and of the first Insidious, nothing was going to stop me.",/review/rw2871396/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2014,Rickting,3," Things that go ""Ahhhhh!"" in a laughably unscary manner in the night
","Insidious was an ace haunted house film although it did get a bit silly towards the end. The family are back and still getting haunted. James Wan made the excellent The Conjuring and was clearly putting all of his effort into that. So maybe he was too focused on that to actually direct this film at all. The first was excellent; yet this is a laughably awful and heartbreakingly lazy follow up. It had the same cast, same good director and some good trailers. How did this happen? James Wan has a few filmmaking tricks up his sleeve, and there are a couple of good scares. The rest of the time, it's a long, boring slog towards a monumentally convoluted and clichéd conclusion. As toys go beep beep in the night, pianos play by themselves, ghosts shriek, people stand around and explain the plot, fog obscures everything and the ghosts do more shrieking, don loads of white face paint, do their best Captain Jack Sparrow impersonations and go ludicrously over the top I nearly switched it off. And I never turn films off once I've started.",/review/rw2871396/?ref_=tt_urv

The Conjuring was far better imho, avoid this one at all costs ! I wonder how much people have been paid to review this mess as ""the movie that would stop the earth from spinning were it a bit scarier"". By the way, stop putting à 10/10 from a movie that is ""scary but not a great movie"" ! Movies that deserve a 10/10 should be a handful at most and not some rubbish made to make money on behalf of no brainers under 18 who have seen at most a 100 film in their lives( ""the best horror movie I have ever seen"" ).

","I loved this movie. Loved it, loved it, loved it. James Wan is one of the best directors of recent times and he makes his stand by offering two awesome horror movies this year. I personally preferred Insidious 2 though, as I appreciated the rich character development and the concept of the Further. There are clear references to The Shining and Psycho but this movie leaves its own mark of disturbing. Of course it's always great to add some light humor in between to dilute the scares (as they REALLY packed a punch in this second installment). So if you're kind of doubting the movie based on its bad rep, don't listen to the negative comments/reviews as this is easily one of the best movies this year.
