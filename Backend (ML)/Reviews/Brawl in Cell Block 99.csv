31 March 2019,DeadMansTrousers,7," Not everyone will enjoy it...but I did
","Most people would agree with the statement that McConaughey does his best work in stoner roles, this is not a straightforward stoner comedy however so don't be disappointed if that's what you are expecting. Anyone who expects anything other than a strange arthouse film from Harmony Korine must not be aware of his style. There is lots to be enjoyed in this film including the humour, music, and supporting cast. It is worth viewing with an open mind, just don't expect Pineapple Express or Cheech and Chong.",/review/rw4935413/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2020,Meeka_Meek,3," The lowest rating I've ever given
","Honestly I'm not to hard to please. This movie had so much potential and it was pissed away just like Moon dog pissed away his and his wife's life. Very unlikable characters I would say the best part of this movie was Martin Lawrence's appearance.
At the end of the day the movie was just sad and showcased how a certain group of people can do absolutely nothing with their life and be handed everything. Man",/review/rw4935413/?ref_=tt_urv

","I watched this movie in hopes that it would be a comedy and have some context and relevancy of what is happening or going to happen, but this movie was completely obscure.",/review/rw4935413/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2019,cupofsoulshow,5," A Middle movie with no real beginning or ending
","Beach Bum is a movie about Moondog. He's a staple in Key West where he spends his days getting high, drinking PBR and occasionally writing. He's a poet by profession but dedicates all his time medicated. He has a wife that has a lover and a daughter that settled into marrying a man so dull he makes a Mormon seem exciting.",/review/rw4935413/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2019,Quinoa1984,8," in a nutshell: full blown madness, dark/violent/nihilistic comic excess, and I liked it (I think)
","How much you like or dislike this movie depends on how much you're into Matthew McConaughey and Harmony Korine making their Cheech and Chong/Hunter S Thompson flick (well, Thompson but as a poet and more The Dude than Raoul Duke).",/review/rw4935413/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2019,SnoopyStyle,3," Is this funny?
","Writer Moondog (Matthew McConaughey) is the beach bum. He lives a hedonistic lifestyle in the Florida Keys. His wealthy wife Minnie (Isla Fisher) is busy with their daughter Heather (Stefania LaVie Owen)'s upcoming wedding. Their friend Lingerie (Snoop Dogg) has a special weed plant. After the wedding, Moondog gets into a car crash which kills Minnie. She leaves her fortune in Heather's control. After yet another drug rampage, Moondog is sentenced to twelve months in rehab where he meets fellow addict Flicker (Zac Efron).",/review/rw4935413/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2019,ReadingFilm,10," The Last Movie
","Another post-irony prank. Remember in Spring Breakers how there was this trace of conscience behind it? Just enough to see it at social critique as the girls gradually drop out and return back to humanity or face the consequences of their actions, bringing forth some accountable artist at work behind it. Beach Bum hints at avenues where it might go there with the daughters tiredness and stoicism, the ex-wife's fate, and his legal repercussions; but any traces of lessons, growth or consequences are stomped to pieces moments later. Korine's artist commentary is strangely hidden in its excess. Every one of my audience walked out. It's so gleefully immoral that in this universe he's rewarded with the highest accolades society can offer because nothing matters.",/review/rw4935413/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2019,ramirez13-2,6," A challenge at times but worth the journey
","This movie is beautifully broken. It is strange, disjointed and like trying to recollect the events after a 10 day binged on the beach.
It's wild, weird and very pretty in its own way. A complete mess that somehow makes sense.
I definitely recommend sticking through it at least once.",/review/rw4935413/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2020,Kilroy5150,6," The movie is fine, it's just set in the wrong era of time.
","I've seen people write that they expected a comedy. Even if labelled that way, this movie wasn't that. I knew guys like this (just not rich) back in the 70s. A lot of them you would meet, spend some time with, and they would just move on. The music fits the 70-80s era better. This movie seems to be more of an ""expression"" of a certain character you might run into.",/review/rw4935413/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2019,joey_k-74060,4," Story of a stoner by a stoner filmed by a stoner

",Oh my God I am a Big Mathew Fan I Love or Like 90 PERCENT of his Films. But of course in this FILM he was so Annoying. Plus Snoop Dogg was in it. That IDIOT CAN'T ACT AT ALL. YOU CAN'T EVEN HEAR HIM SPEAK PROPERLY. PLUS STILL BEING CALLED SNOOP DOG REALLY. He must be in his 50s bye NOW it's Ok Let the DRUGGIE IN REAL LIFE MAKE FILM'S HOLLYWOOD.

13 June 2019,carlos-pires,1," Nothingness
","This is one of those movies which turn out to be material evidence that anything is possible if you have friends to bankroll your whims.
The plot is non-existent and all the characters are paper-thin complete assholes who do whatever they want and get away with it, including setting people's houses on fire and assaulting and mugging senior citizens (But, wait... They're not bad people, they just do it for fun...)
The only redeeming quality of this movie lies in this latent irony not everyone will catch... but I'll give you a hint: t's a movie about spoiled rich people doing whatever they want, made by spoiled rich people who can actually do whatever they want.
Do yourself a favour and skip this one.",/review/rw4935413/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2019,kwenchow,1," This is not a comedy film! Unless I lost my humor! Bored to freaking death!
",This movie is about the life of a depraved rich guy called Moondog! Entire film full of boring conversation! I think the only good thing is almost every partying scene have nudity girl! And full of negative example too! Moondog rob a disable guy at the street! He even escape from a rehab center! He also trafficking drug! He should rot in the prison or die at the end! But instead he been present an award at the end! Only one barely funny scene! Captain Wack's leg bite off by a shark! Lol! I won't watch it if I can reverse time!,/review/rw4935413/?ref_=tt_urv

","So many bad reviews? Heard of an arthouse film? Seen any other movies by Harmony Korine? Enjoy an awesome soundtrack? Enjoy top notch sceneray/directing? Jimmy Buffet or a Snoop fan? With a hillarious script.. the Martin Lawrence dolphins scene is a highlight amongst many.. do urself a favour, if you can watch a movie and not take it so seriously you are in for a treat!!

21 June 2019,Tina_jeppesen,2," Totally sucked
","2 stars just for Matthew M who can do much better than this boring character w no personality but a bad one I wouldn't wana hang out w this guy for more than 5 minutes. We live in Florida where this suppose to take place I told my boyfriend we could go up to any beach bar around here, pick out a 24-7 drunk & follow them around all day, -which is pretty much all this movie is, and be more entertained. Of course that would at least be realistic this dude has endless supplies of money weed & friends although he's not very nice, or cool, or funny & f-Ed up 24/7.... Doesn't care when his wife of 20 some years dies...then again she was doin snoop dog behind his back...as was he doin whoever & whatever he wanted also tho, and his daughter, her husband & zac Efron are unlikable characters too. I mean are we supposed to like or care about the people n this movie?? Because I didn't whatsoever & the only funny or good scene was dolphin boat scene which even coulda been done better in a lot of ways....""Wtf did we just watch"" is all I could say when it was over.",/review/rw4935413/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2021,elias_athan,1," Freedom means responsibility and wisdom
","I saw 20 minutes and turned off the TV. I couldn't stand more of this idiocy. The director and the writer confuse freedom with immaturity and silliness. A man always drunk and high on drugs isn't free. He's just immature and stupid. Now I understand why Gary Oldman refused the role and I think McConaughey was dumb enough to accept it. Some reviewers say that this is freedom and this man lives a free life. A free man is a man mature and responsible who gives all his energy to improve his life and others people lives. A man drunk who falls unconcious on the floor and wastes his days taking dope and having ""fun"" where ""fun"" means spending my days without respecting myself and the others isn't free. He's just a child who didn't grow up.",/review/rw4935413/?ref_=tt_urv
