12 May 2009,TheLittleSongbird,7," Enjoyable, but pales in comparison to the first two movies.
","I enjoyed Shrek the Third, but I found a lot of it very disappointing as well. The plot is very contrived, and has been done better many times before. The script, has a number of very bright spots, but is dull in comparison to two very good predecessors. It just goes to show how sequels are nearly always inferior to the original. In fact, the only sequels that surpass their original is Toy Story 2, Home Alone 2 and Garfield 2. There is a very funny scene with Donkey and Puss in Boots having a sort of body swap, and Donkey doing that priceless innocent eye look. But that is pretty much it, though girls may delight in Fiona and all the fairytale princesses having some sort of princess reunion. The animation is mostly well done, and the voice talents are very good indeed, especially Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas. However, the film, which showed a lot of promise, is undermined by a contrived storyline and an uneven script. All in all, enjoyable, but it could have been much better. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox.",/review/rw1658632/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2007,3xHCCH,6," Not Enough to be at level of first 2!
","The movie did not really hold the attention of my two younger kids. Even for me, the funny experience of watching both Shrek 1 and 2 was not really very evident with this installment. I remember in Shrek 2, I was laughing out loud with each passing pop culture reference and innuendo being bantered around. However, that was not so here.",/review/rw1658632/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2007,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," It was good, but it's lacking something
","I couldn't wait to see Shrek the Third, especially since I have such a great love for the second Shrek, I'm just in love with Puss in Boots. But, the trailer looked great and the stories have worked so far, my mom and I saw the premier show today and while the movie has great laughs, there seemed to be something lacking in the Shrek world. I think the characters didn't seem to click as well as they did in the first two. Shrek the Third has the return of the whole cast, including the new heir to the thrown, Arthur.",/review/rw1658632/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2007,mstomaso,6," As clever, but not as funny as the first two
","Shrek The Third is another entertaining romp through the erstwhile Hollywood of Far Far Away with a few laughs for adults and a few more for kids. Like all of the films in this series, it has a big and good heart, and occasionally pays homage to or pokes fun at modern films. Unlike the previous films, however, Shrek III is not a source of non-stop hilarity, and contains a little more thematic content.",/review/rw1658632/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2007,Buddy-51,4," Shrek dreck
","It would be safe to say that the third time is definitely NOT the charm when it comes to the ""Shrek"" series, since ""Shrek the Third"" lacks virtually all the imaginativeness, wit and magic that made the previous two installments such tremendous fun for young and old viewers alike. In this latest go-round, the writers have clearly run out of comical inspiration, leaving us with a humorless farrago of labored jokes and sappy life-lessons (mainly about the joys of prospective fatherhood and the importance of being willing to take a chance in life) guaranteed to please no target audience or age group whatsoever.",/review/rw1658632/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2007,onepotato2,1," Skip it
","Shrek 3 trusts it's audience so little and has squandered so much good will in it's effort to milk cash from viewers, that it places it's characters on screen and nervously has them do stupid, ""funny"" things to reignite your interest and get the movie rolling. For fifteen minutes it barely considers plot, because maybe you don't like plot. So how about another pratfall?",/review/rw1658632/?ref_=tt_urv

","When his new father-in-law, King Harold falls ill, Shrek is looked at as the heir to the land of Far Far Away. Not one to give up his beloved swamp, Shrek recruits his friends Donkey and Puss in Boots to install the rebellious Artie as the new king.

29 May 2007,Eschete,3," A Shrek Too far
","A movie too many, a laugh too few. This installment of Shrek is so unlike the first two in terms of energy and humor that its almost like one of those cheesy made-for-TV or straight-to-video versions that the studios make just to cash in on the popularity of a title.",/review/rw1658632/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2007,Jay_Exiomo,5," This ogre is starting to lose his charms
","The phenomenal success of the Shrek franchise - particularly ""Shrek 2"" - has prompted Dreamworks Animation to yet again squeeze out a story of an erstwhile happily ended tale and return to the screen once again with ""Shrek the Third"", which brings back most of the original cast, and then some, for another round of jabs at fairy tales and pop culture.",/review/rw1658632/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2007,petra_ste,3," Remember when it was funny?
","I enjoyed Shrek and Shrek 2 for a simple reason: they made me laugh. I hated Shrek the Third (from now on S3) for an even simpler reason: I sat through it bored and stony-faced. I think I giggled three times during the whole movie, all in the first ten minutes.",/review/rw1658632/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2007,mollymormonbrat,5," Too many characters to love--and that's a bad thing. And the spark is gone.
","I have been bouncing around for weeks in anticipation of this movie. As a huge fan of the first two movies, I was sure this one would not disappoint. But, oh, how wrong I was! While not as bad as many a film out there, this installment is yet a sad shadow of its series.",/review/rw1658632/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2008,ltlacey,1," The third installment of the Shrek series.
","Of any sequel to any movie I have ever seen, Shrek the Third has to be the worst I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. When a movie is this bad I usually will stop watching it, but I thought that maybe it would go somewhere. Well, it did. Reference the movie title, Flushed Away. This is what anyone who was connected to this farce should have insisted on happening. The storyline is plausible. The King is dying and must name an heir. At first Shrek is asked to become the new King, but the little experience Shrek has had with being royal has not worked out. The scene where he and Fiona are all decked out in royal attire is painful. Not just to the characters, even though they were just drawn, in wearing such uncomfortable clothing, but to the viewer who must endure this torture as well. So off our hero and his side-kicks must go and get the next in line, a wallflower-type geek, Arthur. Oh yea, before they are out of earshot Shrek learns that he will soon be a dad. I have read that some people say that it's because of Justin Timberlake that this movie was ruined, but like everyone else, all he supplied was a voice. A monotonous, squeaky one, but a voice just the same. In fact, it seemed from what I could tell just by listening to everyone's voices, that no one seemed to be really into their characters at all. Jokes and scenes that worked well for the 1st 2 movies did not work for the 3rd movie, and in fact, besides being stale, no longer had any appeal. That there is a 4th, and possibly a 5th Shrek, is scary. Be afraid. Be very afraid.",/review/rw1658632/?ref_=tt_urv

However, Shrek decides to find the legitimate heir Artie in a distant kingdom with his friends Donkey and Puss in Boots to be able return to his beloved house in the swamp with the pregnant Fiona.

16 May 2007,editor-299,5," Once vibrant series showing signs of middle age
","Halfway through the third installment of the popular CGI franchise, ""Shrek,"" one gets the distinct feeling that the end is near. What prompts these emotions? Oh, just the fact that the writers seem to have run out of ideas, funny jokes and interesting new characters.",/review/rw1658632/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2018,Bored_Dragon,7," Great, but not amazing
","""Shrek the Third"" was made in the same manner as the first two, as a combination of parodies to various fairy tales with references to pop culture. But even though it's a top-quality cartoon, it's not at the level of its predecessors. Animation and music are excellent, but there's less humor and it's less funny. While I was crying of laughter during first two movies, this time I sincerely laughed just a few times. Although, to be honest, I'm not sure if this is due to a weaker scenario or it's simply saturation, because sequels that stick to the recipe of the first film inevitably lack originality and the surprise factor. Movie is great, but it does not bring anything new.",/review/rw1658632/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2010,lesleyharris30,9," The Worst Shrek,But Still Quality Family Entertainment,
","Shrek The Third is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline,a very impressive voice cast and brilliant characters.It is without a doubt my least favourite of all the Shrek movies,the story just isn't as good and more that the jokes miss more often this time around,but its still a great animated movie for the whole family to enjoy,and like the other two there are plenty of jokes for younger and older members of the family to laugh at.If your a fan of the first two Shrek's,you will definitely be disappointed by Shrek the Third,but you will will still laugh and enjoy very much.",/review/rw1658632/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2007,xxali311xx,5," Disappointing . . . kept on waiting for it to ""really start""
","I'm a huge fan of the first Shrek and the second one also exceeded my expectations. Both of those movies had an meaningful and multidimensional plot. They also shared clever humor and for the most part unpredictable. I was extremely excited for the the third movie and I have to unfortunately say I was totally disappointed! The whole time I was waiting for it to start, like trying to convince myself, ""ok, any second now it will pick up"" - but it never did. The plot is so thin and unexciting - Prince Charming wants to takeover the throne while Shrek wants to get a young (King) Arthur to replace him as next in line to the throne. You never really feel any interest in what is happening or what will happen to the characters because you know exactly whats going to happen. Basically I spent the movie forcing myself to laugh because, hey, I was watching a Shrek movie. I know this review will not stop anyone who loved the previous movies from going to the third, but I just want to warn that its nothing to rush to or stand in line for.",/review/rw1658632/?ref_=tt_urv

19 May 2007,pschwebe,5," The movie that rates itself: The Third.
","Paul McCartney is a great songwriter. Let me just get that out of the way. But he isn't perfect. Take for example the song, ""Live and Let Die"", a song he wrote in the '70s for a Bond movie of the same name. The song is used briefly in Dreamworks' latest outing for everyone's favorite Scots ogre. In the song he actually wrote this line: ""But if in this ever changing world in which we live in"". ""In which we live in""? Was he kidding? A great talent, but that is some lazy songwriting. I figure he was either exhausted, or under contract, as opposed to being inspired.",/review/rw1658632/?ref_=tt_urv
