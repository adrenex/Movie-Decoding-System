20 February 2021,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,8," Excellent twisty thriller
","I really liked it and I didn't see the twist at the very end coming. It totally surprised me. But going over the whole story in my head, it made sense. The clues were there all along in the beginning of the show. Very well written thriller. Was i the only one who thought Eve Hewson has a passing resemblance to Isabella Rossellini?",/review/rw8219987/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2021,badreviewer,3," A shocking plot twist? Yes. Is it logical? No.
","This show has a great plot twist at the end and I think that is what makes it shine. However, that ending is illogical for me. I understand how Adele and Rob changed their bodies, they both knew what they were doing and they both did it on purpose; but I really don't understand what was Louise's motivation when she left her body while Adele were ""comitting"" suicide. What can people do in astral travel? They can only watch things, they cannot speak to people or anything, so why would she do that? Trying to find a window to break and enter the house would be MUCH more reasonable but for some reason Louise decides to do the most illogical thing on earth.",/review/rw8219987/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2021,kosmasp,8," Inside out
","The question with this movie: is the whole build up worth what it culminates to? The ending, the twist of sorts .. that you may see coming or not. Now you have to be the judge of that ultimately - I can only give you pointers and tell you my perspective on it. So for the ending to happen as it does, a lot of things have to come together that are almost .. coincidence. Certain things you can't plan ... actually hoping for or planning for something to happen the exact way it does is rather ... let's say tough.",/review/rw8219987/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2021,jetkot,10," Brilliant all the way
",You get hints all along. You are thinking all the time. It keeps you guessing and in the end it spins around with a huge twist. Brilliant storytelling. Exactly the kind of Psychological thrillers I love.,/review/rw8219987/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2021,petewood-59951,1," Reverse Engineered
","I think the whole problem with this series is that the ending was going to happen come hell or high water. Rather than have the characters behave logically, the characters had to reach that twist ending which wasn't that much of a twist, because it was pretty much telegraphed in episode 5.
I honestly liked it better as a straight psychological thriller. When they brought in the hokey magic, I just cringed and hoped it wouldn't end the way I feared.
Great acting, but way too much implausible behavior.
Rob meets Adele's fiance and after one day decides he loves him so much that he's willing to switch bodies with Adele and kill his old body. Then he has to hope that Adele stupidly goes into his almost overdosed body before his old body dies. Then he has to convince David to dispose of the body and hide it instead of calling the cops.
Then he in Adele's body has to somehow convince Louise, David's mistress to be friends with him so he can teach her astral projection so he can switch bodies with her. Uh huh.
Then David, who is really the good guy has to act like a damned asshole to Louise so she sympathizes with ""Adele."" And even when Adele and David are alone they speak cryptically about the past instead of just coming out and saying stuff. And David when he tries to warn Louise about Adele keeps acting like an asshole and his warning about her comes out more like a threat from him.
But I cried BS the most when Adele contacts Louise and tells her she is going to kill herself. Instead of calling the cops like any sane person would do, Louise astral projects over. WHERE SHE COULDN'T HAVE HELPED ANYWAY!!!!
And Rob/Adele pulls off the body switch again.
God, I really hate the body switch trope.
I was loving this show until episode five when the hocus pocus took front and center and nobody behaved sensibly.
Very disappointing.",/review/rw8219987/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2021,blanche-2,6," intriguing but disappointing
","Behind Her Eyes is a decent story - up to a point - and well acted by Simona Brown, Eve Hewson, and Tom Bateman.",/review/rw8219987/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2021,aecceity,8," Damn
","Best plot twist I've seen in a long time. I cannot stress enough how important it is to not read any reviews or spoilers before watching this. You might find the pacing a little slow at times (at least I imagine some people would) but personally I liked it. I'll take a slow burn over too quick and messy pacing any day of the week. And just know that either way, the ending will make it all worthy of your time.",/review/rw8219987/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2021,roxmewild,3," Great start let down by silly ending
","Can not fault the acting which is top notch and as drama/ thriller it was engaging a little far fetched that the wife accidentally bumps into the husbands love interest so understandably there had to be more to it .
However in doing this and unveiling the story is sadly we're this show goes down hill fast I mean seriously astral projection is one thing but add to it whereby you return to another persons body is were it becomes totally silly.",/review/rw8219987/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2021,johannes2000-1,5," A very promising start but a failed conclusion.
","The first 4 episodes were very good, full of mysteries, secrets and thrilling twists, promising an exciting psychological thriller. But unfortunately from episode 5 on, the story more and more turned into sci-fi and fantasy, with in the last episode a totally unrealistic and farfetched conclusion, crossing the border of the supernatural. What a waste of a potentially strong premise and of some fine acting, I actually felt a bit betrayed for having been lured into the story and getting so involved at first, just to be made a fool of in the end.",/review/rw8219987/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2021,TreeFiddy53,8," Surely watch this, but pay attention!
","It has suspense, mystery, supernatural elements, all sorts of twists and turns. This show, that could be categorized as a slow burn, has only 6 episodes. You can tell that there's something wrong, that something doesn't add up, but you can't tell what. And they did a good job of wrapping all that into a package that kept me hooked and engaged.
Good acting by everyone involved, decent music to keep the intensity up, very well shot, and they seem to jump back-and-forth in their storytelling which didn't feel choppy at all. When you start figuring things out, you're gonna be like ""I did NOT see that coming!"" Or at least ""Why did I not see this coming!? The clues were RIGHT THERE!""
Parts of the show, I thought were super predictable, until they weren't. But i had to wait until the end to find that out. And i wasn't disappointed at all. This show is a quick weekend watch, I'm glad that they decided to keep it to 6 episodes and didn't do 10.
I'd recommend the show!
Only, don't watch the show while you're doing something else. There will be clues here and there that you'd wish you had picked up as you start putting the puzzle together at the end. If you like shows with accents, you should surely watch this one",/review/rw8219987/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2021,richardkiddle,4," The ""twist"" is nonsense
","Annoyed with myself for wasting my time on this Netflix series, all because I'd read about the ""big twist"" . Turns out the twist is bonkers & ruins what has gone before, not that it was exactly scintillating viewing up to that point.",/review/rw8219987/?ref_=tt_urv

","This has been the first drama series of 2021 that I have wanted to binge watch all in one. This is a terrific six part series, that retains its pace, tension and drama throughout, there is no dip.

","Began well, liked the characters. But then the whole 'twist' relies on us believing in Astral projecting?? C'mon guys! The fluorescent dream scenes ok, but then after that the floaty smoky squiggly travelling souls. Just silly. I watched it until the thoroughly disappointing ending.",/review/rw8219987/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2021,daniel-14284,6," Same ending as the book
",The show was ok I read the book a while back and the characters in the show are a bit more interesting then they are in the book. With that said I did not like the ending in the book at all I was hoping the show would be different but it's not. To me the whole body switch thing is stupid and ruined what would of been a really interesting story. I wouldn't say this is not worth a watch but I would say a lot of people won't like how it ends.,/review/rw8219987/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2021,cenmail,6," Good but hated the ending
","Liked the story. Good acting. Suspenseful... but damn, I hated the ending. Maybe I'm a wuss, or maybe it's just cuz I'm a mom, but I really wish it could've had a happy ending-you know, good conquers evil? And why'd they have to screw over poor, innocent Adam. Like, that's a textbook way to ruin a good flick--just have a kid lose his mom at the end. :(",/review/rw8219987/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2021,Pairic,8," Dark Thriller
","Behind Her Eyes: A dark psychological thriller series which segues into horror so smoothly that you hardly notice it happening/ The plot at first seems a bit too hackneyed - a psychiatrist's secretary, Louise, has an affair with her employer, David, and becomes best friends with his wife, Adele, at the same time. But there's a lot more going on than meets the eye, Adele's parents had died in fire which David had rescued her from. There is also a mystery as to why David and Adele had to move from Brighton and Louise suffers from night terrors and sleepwalking. The horror is mostly psychological but some really disturbing events occur on screen. There is also a paranormal touch to the events which cannot be revealed without giving too much away. Plus you get a couple of plot twists which will made me gasp but were convincing. Directed by Erik Richter Strand and written by Steve Lightfoot. On Netflix. 8/10.",/review/rw8219987/?ref_=tt_urv

24 February 2021,baunacholi-86159,8," Original
","Episode 1, sets the stage but overall it appears rather flat or cliche (a cheating husband, a troubled wife and a mistress). Hardly tension or whatsoever. I thought what's the point and why continue? Well cause of episode 2: it picks up speed and starts to evolve into mystery. Characters become more and more complex and twisted in episode 3.arriving at episode 4, things take shape but still they managed to keep u guessing - a lot. Dreams become an essential part of the story. But the best scene is clearly Adele in the kitchen. From episode 5 on, a supernatural vibe kicks in and all 4 main characters (lets add now Rob officially into the mix) are more faceted than u thought. Tragedy takes over and the twist, well either you love or hate it. I can firmly say: original.
If u are into red herrings and twists, behind her eyes is a clear yes! I",/review/rw8219987/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2021,larry-butchins,6," Why, oh why, oh why???
","It was ticking along nicely until around episode 5 when they started introducing weird astral projection stuff and by the nd of the series I'd lost it. No, no,. no...totally unlikely, implausible, not in the real world. OK, some people may believe in this stuff, and good luck to them. But to make it the denouement of this (up until then) reasonably intriguing story, just doesn't cut it. I would far rather have had Adele hint at this stuff (to enhance her weirdness), but to actually have been tracking her husband and Louise with a security camera, or via Louise's cellphone, or laptop, or even a drone outside her window - all this would have seemed more likely. Did NOT like the way this resolved. Oh dear, oh dear, because it kept us hooked for 4 out of 6 episodes. Good acting by the way, beautiful cast, nice production; what a pity.",/review/rw8219987/?ref_=tt_urv

9 June 2022,SnapbacksAndSneakers,9," Incredible
","I don't get why there are so many bad ratings and reviews on this. I thought this show was so good and the plot twist at the end was mind-blowing. It kept me guessing until the very end and even if you think you can predict what's gonna happen at the end, you can't. And then if you go back and watch it after knowing what happens there are so many clues and details to catch. I loved it and if you enjoy twist endings like I do then I definitely recommend watching. I wish I could watch it again for the first time. It's been at least a month since I finished it and I still can't stop thinking about it. One of the best shows I've seen in a while.",/review/rw8219987/?ref_=tt_urv
