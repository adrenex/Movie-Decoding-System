26 August 2018,Jared_Andrews,7," An Absolute Delight
","Netflix has been scorching the rom-com game this summer. As other major movie studios have neglected this beloved genre, Netflix has capitalized on this underserved market by releasing a steady stream rom-coms just about every week. The latest, 'To All the Boys I've Loved Before,' is perhaps the best yet. ",/review/rw4299902/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2018,siderite,9," For a romantic movie it is really great!
","No, she is not a shy girl with spectacles that suddenly finds her true love to remove the spectacles and notice she is beautiful. No, he is not a mindless cruel jock with the only purpose in life to show girls what not to date. No, he is not the good friend who in the end gets the girl because that's who she really loved. The characters in this film feel real and act like real people. It is so painfully obvious that the movie is based on a book: few original scripts for romantic movies ever pay attention to the people in the story and care about making the story original and relatable at the same time.",/review/rw4299902/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2018,karlkennethwatson,9," A heartwarming blast of love
","This movie has this certain vibe that makes you want to fall inlove. The script of the movie was definitely superb and was able to translate the emotion that you would feel while reading the book. The cast, the music, the atmosphere of the film, evwrything was on point. Definitely a must see",/review/rw4299902/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2018,Scarefish,7," A pleasant surprise.
","I'm not going to lie, there were a lot of red flags going in to this, given the massive amount of dull and terrible Netflix films that have come out this year, many of which focused on relationships and slice-of-life type stuff, but I think I kind of like this one. It's certainly the least obnoxious of the bunch, and is even more surprisingly carried by the young female supporting actress. There's nothing this film does that's extraordinary, but it's an easily watchable film that's fine through and through, and manages to avoid dragging despite having such a simple premise and it doesn't overstay its welcome. The leads in the film aren't amazing, but they're certainly above average, and are relatively charming. The film is quite heavily reliant on exposition, and feels oddly reminiscent of 13 Reasons Why, though I would say this is a much more tasteful story that handles it's premise appropriately whereas 13 Reasons Why felt melodramatic and edgy. The melodrama here manages to be less melodramatic, and the material is light-hearted enough to deal with a pinch of superficial acting.",/review/rw4299902/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2018,mimi232,8," Really liked it!
","I haven't read the book, and hadn't heard about it, so I didn't have high expectations. Like others have said, Netflix hasn't had many good original movies recently (or shows, for that matter), but this one was good. I didn't have high expectations for the first 10 minutes but it redeemed itself pretty quickly. I think i might read the book!",/review/rw4299902/?ref_=tt_urv

","Lara Jean Song Covey is a shy Korean-American teen girl. She is obsessed with romance novels and has written five love letters to her various crushes over the years. She keeps them secret in her late mother's box. It's a secret until her younger sister Kitty mails them out to force her out of her box. Three of the letters go out to classmates Peter Kavinsky, Josh Sanderson, and Lucas James. Lucas is gay. Her long-time neighbor friend Josh has been dating her older sister Margot until Margot breaks up with him before leaving for college in Scotland. Peter is the jock boyfriend of Jen, Lara Jean's former best friend. Jen still holds a grudge against her for a spin-the-bottle kiss with Peter when they were much younger. After Jen dumps Peter, Peter has the idea to have a fake relationship with Lara Jean.",/review/rw4299902/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2018,freya-156-902807,7," worth watching but nothing revolutionary
","It was a very cute story, and nicely shot. For the most part I found the dialogue to be natural and believable and the fake dating trope (though far from something we've never seen before) is one I can never tire of.",/review/rw4299902/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2020,Brad_G35,9," You can call this 34 year old man a 15 year old teenager but...
","I loved this freaking movie! I don't think there has been a young romance movie like this in a while. This movie has an atmosphere to it. It's half young romance/half coming of age. This movie never popped up for me until the sequel came out. After reading a synopsis, I didn't have high expectations.",/review/rw4299902/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2019,LBarlane24,4," Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
","Having watched it again, I'm going to be perfectly honest and say that my opinion on this film hasn't changed all that much. Let me start off by saying that I thought the direction of the film was fine, nothing great. This is a lot more than I can say for the acting, which was, there I say, below average, especially from the lead actress; there was one exception though, and that (at least. for me) was the actress who played the little sister.",/review/rw4299902/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2020,NothingGoodToWatch,1," A below average movie with below average performances and below average script
","A really awful movie. Let me explain why ~ the 30 something actress playing the 18 year old sister, the perfect boyfriend being dumped for absolutely no reason, the ridiculously mean ''mean girl''(but sadly not hot and blonde and beautiful like the stereotypical mean girl), the sassy best friend, the perfect ''Calvin Kline model'' guy falling for the boring girl wit nothing to recommend her. But what really dragged this movie down into mediocrity was the main actresses rather insipid performance. I wish they had used an actress with better acting skills and more charisma, that might just have turned this movie around. She was less like a high school girl and more like a boring, middle aged mom. The other characters like the dad, older sister, mean girl, best friend weren't all that convincing in their roles either. There was allot of recitation of lines without any real acting or emotion. The script was generic and nothing really special. Noah Castelano is really a beautiful guy and so it made no sense for this cute, perfect guy to date the crazy, not so sexy mean girl or fall for the mom like girl. And honestly if guys like this existed in high school ~ beautiful, sweet, mature, selfless and supposedly a ''jock'' then high school would be heaven for every girl.
The most ridiculous part about this movie is the way these 15 year old children speak like mature, adults who have everything figured out. Come on, teenagers are the most irrational, immature, confused people on earth. They're selfish and don't have a clue. These kids have long conversations that make them sound like middle aged moms and dads. Noah as Peter was cute and charming but had a very ''cool dad '' vibe about him and not at all believable as a 16 year old high school kid. Overall an absolutely unbelievable movie with not a single special aspect.",/review/rw4299902/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2020,mkquinn91,3," Overrated and poorly acted
","Why in the world does everyone seem to love this? I couldn't even finish it. I got to about 40 minutes left and couldn't stand the total lack of chemistry between the two leads, the inane plot, and the wooden acting. Lana Condor's narration in particular was totally devoid of emotion, which is fitting for a movie that seems to star androids trying to pass as human. They may have been developed as advanced marketing tools by Subway based on the aggressive product placement.",/review/rw4299902/?ref_=tt_urv

","Having watched a lot of girl romantic comedies and the like, I was really surprised how bad this movie turned out to be. The story has basically no depth at all and while you desperately wait for someone to do something for something to happen you realize that the movie is almost over. It's like many other Netflix movies lately, overrated and boring.",/review/rw4299902/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2018,wizards-03318,10," Cute little high school chick flick
","I never read the book but I really enjoyed this movie it's super cute and the characters are not annoying which I was afraid of and the acting was good. I didn't expect to like it this much, I am a 27 year old woman and just randomly decided to watch this high school flick which I never do and I thought I had grown out of the celebrity crush phase but apparently I did not (Peter Kavinsky). I highly recommend this movie if you just want to watch something happy and not super drama filled or depressing. I especially love that the main character is Asian, there is a sad shortage of Asian American actresses and actors in America so it was refreshing to see something different for once.",/review/rw4299902/?ref_=tt_urv

","...This movie just wasn't made for me. I think I was supposed to be super invested in this character's plight, but I just found her charisma-less. She only goes between three emotions the whole movie: mildly upset, mildly content, and mildly mild.

19 August 2018,austinfromdahood,7," A unique teen movie with many flaws, but still good
","Yesterday night I was watching a rom com with my 2 cousins. They really wanted to watch a newly released Netflix movie that was based on a book they liked. That movie was To All The Boys I've Loved Before. At first, I was hesitant, because I don't usually like rom coms and I don't like much movies that was based on a book. I decided to watch it with them, and this movie was actually a huge surprise. I expected a cliche high school rom com movie, but this movie is way more than that. Lana Condor plays Lara Jean Convey, a girl that depends on her older sister Margot quite often. She doesn't have much friends at school, and she's written a letter for every single boy she has liked, but she keeps them for herself. Then, these letters get out to the public in such a creative way, and then the conflict is made for the protagonist. I really think this movie is relatable on so many levels. Being an outsider, having a major crush on someone, and being involved in school drama. Lana Condor is probably one of the best actors in this movie, and her character goes through a lot in this movie, and I was mostly invested in her journey. Hr sisters in this movie are also hilarious, and they are a good trio. The people that play Lara Jean's crushes are also very good in this movie. The father in this movie is also a very important and he is the funniest character in this movie. The story is pretty investing and I cared for Lara Jean and her problems. This movie is far from perfect though. I thought Gen, a person that likes one of Lara Jean's crushes was a very cliche character and she didn't really need to be in this film. And they bring her up so much because one of Lara Jean's crushes used to date her and I felt like that whole subplot was unnecessary. Another part of the film that I did not like was a character named Josh. He is one of Lara Jean's crushes and although his acting was pretty good, he did not get enough screen time in my opinion. He is one of the most important characters because the story mostly revolves around him. He only got like 10 minutes of screentime at most and that isn't enough. There are also a bunch of continuity errors in this film that were so obvious it's not even funny and it really bugged me. The ending didn't feel very fulfilling in my opinion and it sets up a possible sequel to this movie, and I didn't like that. There is also a lot of obvious product placement that bugged me as well. If you're lonely one night on netflix and you want to watch a good teen movie, I think this movie is for you. 7/10",/review/rw4299902/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2018,myfam-86505,7," Good for all ages
","Oldsters (like me) are decades removed from this movie's target YA audience but, if you liked the teenage angst movies of John Hughes (""Sixteen Candles,"" ""Pretty in Pink,"" ""Some Kind of Wonderful"") you can truly enjoy this modern-day, politically corrected dip into that genre. (""Sixteen Candles"" actually gets a shout-out in the flick.)",/review/rw4299902/?ref_=tt_urv
