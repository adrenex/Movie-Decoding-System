31 January 2021,Calicodreamin,6," Angsty teens with powers
","First off, pros, beautiful cinematography and a captivating storyline. Second, cons, angsty teens with powers run around causing havoc and just being annoying.",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2021,Unfilmy,1," Bloom is a stuck-up immature and ungrateful airhead.
","Pathetic acting. And none of the students look 16-17. I don't know their real ages, but they look like they are having mid life crisis. The most annoying character is probably the lead, Bloom. She is ungrateful to her friends and she just thinks about herself. She impulsively takes stupid decisions and puts everyone in danger. Her friends are dumb enough to not know how selfish she is being. If I was her roommate, I'd have smacked the narcissism out of her. On one side, we had Harry Potter who also wanted to get to know his parents but he wasn't a dumb, stuck-up Dolt like Bloom.",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,kerryc-95876,1," Boring
","Was looking forward to the second series but it's very dull slow and not a lot of action just kissing sex and arguing what happened!?feel like I'm watching a different t series! Such a shame maybe it's just me I don't know! Started off ok then slowly got boring!!!! Maybe it's just me but I've read some other reviews stating similar,I'm on episode 6 and it's still got no better feel bad for leaving this review!",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2021,a_sad_cow,5," Definitely created for the girls
","Watched this with my wife over the past week or so, and it's not too horrible, but there are definitely plot holes and biases. Pretty obvious they made this with a young female demographic in mind. All kinds of diversity on the female casting side, yet the guys are a pretty homogenous set of pretty boys that like to pretend to be strong.",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,drael64,5," Basic teen drama + magic
","There's a very simple world concept, not dissimilar to harry potter, or sabrina with a few different rules. There's some angsty teens hot for each other. That's about it.",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2021,cjonesas,6," [6.5] Welcome to the Winx magical circus
","A series with mostly average acting, terrible writing, laughable development and just some nice VFX and heart-warming teenish score!",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,jmholt-41201,2," Don't waist your precious leisure time on the first season of this show because the second season is not worth the watch.
","The first season was a fun watch for me, and I looked forward to watching the second season. The second season was finally released and I started watching it straight away. The second season is beyond boring and the storyline is so awful I only made it to the beginning of Episode 3 and gave up. There is no storyline or character development, but there is copious amounts of sex and sensuality paired with awful music. Which I could stand if there was some type of excitement like a good fight or the use of magic. I am so disappointed because it took a really long time for the second season to be released. I'm glad I made the decision to move on to a different show. Hope this helps.#HardPass.",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2021,helenkolby-40950,1," Time I'll never get back
","What is everyone else watching? These ratings are absurd. I saw Winx and thought, oh I got down with that cartoon back in the day. I'd still rather get down with the cartoon. 36 years old and I'd straight up rather watch the old cartoon series. I can't even gather the words to express how bad this is. If they took out the sexual references and swear words it would be appropriate for kids but as is, waste of acting",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2021,joaovitorn-13727,4," Was this made by The CW?
",Is this a CW show?,/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2021,jorgevigara,1," Another stereotype show with fancy effects.
","One more show on the crappy high school culture of rivalry, popularity and narcissism.",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2022,wildernessbarbie,4," If Harry Potter Had Stupid, Selfish 21 Year Olds
","I'm willing to give just about any fantasy show a go and easy rating. Not looking for Shakespeare, just mild entertainment.",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2021,matthessam,2," Bloom - Protagonist or Antagonist?
","By episode 5 I genuinely disliked Bloom, I don't understand how she is the heroine of the story here. Stella is presented as narcissistic, but the true narcissist is Bloom because throughout the show she clearly demonstrates that she only cares about herself and what she wants and she's willing to sacrifice everyone, including her friends to get it.",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2021,marjan-496-846456,1," Bad one, waste of my time.
","It's a waste of time watching this series! The magic story also needs logic and reason, so people do not turn around and cut. The biggest help of this series is the special effect, and the good actors in the story are lazy, they have nothing.",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2021,mapika,2," if you leave all the addictive props away, it's a children's show
","First of all, it sucks already with the overrepresentation of all the typical Lobby-products like alcohol, cigarettes and vaporizers in every film production! They always try to make it look like, you can either only party, relax or wash your problems down with alcohol and/or drugs. This narrative is such a worn out cliché, and yet we can still see it in as good as every production.
It would be brave and refreshing to see more without all these addictive props!",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2021,taedirish,1," Enough with the fairies!!!
","I had to force myself to suffer thru the first episode. It was so incredibly cliche and full of generic teen angst. The story line was remarkably unoriginal, new girl, new school, new powers, blah blah blah...
Oh, and let's throw in a mysterious magical creature and a ""girl"" who is clearly either a creature or some kind of bad guy in disguise. My guess is she'll be some kind of valdermort-type character.
What's the deal with fairies? So many other possible creatures and these shows keep picking fairies, I'm just sick of it...
I definitely feel like this is a one season and some kind of thing but Netflix is so desperate for content, who knows...",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2021,stehartley,7," Dull, boring mediocre
","Not a lot to be said about this show. Characters are blah and story is boring, really drags its heels. Very little chemistry between the cast and very little to keep you focused.",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2021,melissaborodin,9," Give Fate a Chance
","Fate is so much different than the colorful Winx from Nickelodeon, but that's OK. It's trying to be its own thing and I think it worked! I was scared it would be as terrible as the other time they tried making a Live Action version of a Nick show (Avatar the Last Airbender), but no, I thought it blew all my expectations out of the water! Abigail Cowan and all her cast mates did such a good job, there's so much to like here!!",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2021,sagetwo,4," Not my Winx!
","I decided to give the show a chance. Besides some of the cool CGI (such as Bloom's transformation), everything else was terrible. Winx Saga was the ""sibling"" of The Craft: Legacy, Shadowhunters and Legacies with the use of Riverdale language. The female characters had limited character/friendship development in a predictable ""dark"" story. Also, there were 'out of place' references to Harry Potter, Lord of the Files and some of the social terms. Even if the show was nothing like the Winx Club that I grew up with, I hoped that at least the new narrative would be good. But it was like any teen drama on television nowadays. But if you love The Craft: Legacy or the other movies/tv shows mentioned earlier, you may like it? I guess.",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2021,SandOwl_,2," Teens deserve better than this, we all do
","This series had promise.
Until half way through and the Bloom character is a total self serving, ugly character.
There is no empathy for the whining girl whose actually had a fortunate life.
It's so bad that by the 5th episode I was looking at the actress and thinking how ugly she is.
The character is so dislikeable, that it's permeated through to the actual actress. I mean that never happens. Not ever.",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2021,kimeunb,1," Bloom is the worst character
",Actually bloom ruined everything. Literally every single episode was bad because of bloom...,/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2021,agnethagillbanks20,8," A good show with great potential!!!
",I just finished the 1st season and i must say it was really good. I was a fan of the winx club as a kid and I was so excited when I saw the trailer. I am so pleased with the show. Good acting and interesting story line. It was just 6 episodes so I'm hoping it does not get cancelled like most good shows do and they give the chance to grow. It will be really interesting to see where this show takes us and I'm really excited for the next season.,/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2021,aliyerliyurtt,1," Embarrassingly bad
","It is a shame that they used the name ""winx"" to get the undeserved attention to a cheap magical teen drama. Everything about the series, without exception, is cliché. There is nothing exciting to see.",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2021,movieturtle2013,6," Fate has potential
","It's based on a concept but it's a separate show. It certainly is more grown up and ""edgy"". The writing at times is cringey. Time passes too fast and the connection between the leads feels forced and not really genuine. The character's depths aren't really explored and Bloom's backstory is also weirdly set-up. After finishing the season you don't really have the feeling that anything that important happened. The plot is rather bland and rushed over.
I still think that the show can stand well on its own and I'm looking forward to see more of how they explore this potential in future seasons.",/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2021,imdb-ikysmoviedatabase,10," Pretty good
",Really good and colourful show. I think everyone will love the show. Update my ratings to 10 sins I've now finished the season. I would recommend everyone to try it. Its is pretty much safe to watch with family.,/review/rw6513388/?ref_=tt_urv
