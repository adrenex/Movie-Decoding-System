16 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,10," Incredible!
","I don't even know how to describe how much I love Spartacus, both the original and the prequel. I've watched the entire series all the way through at least four or five times because it's just that good. All you have to is read through the reviews to see how beloved this series is. The entire cast is just incredible. I think most people thought when Andy Whitfield tragically died and they had to recast the role of Spartacus that it would drop in quality. It didn't! As good as Whitfield was, Liam McIntyre stepped in and was just as good. It will grab your attention from the first episode and hold it throughout the series. If you haven't seen this amazing show yet stop what you're doing right now and go watch it!",/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2020,Supermanfan-13,10," Perfect!
","Spartacus is ridiculously underrated and absolutely one of my favorite tv shows ever! It is one of the rare shows where each season is just as incredible as the others, all 4 seasons are fantastic & some of the best tv I've ever seen! I've watched the entire series 3 times already. After the original actor (Andrew Whitfield) who played Spartacus sadly died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after Season 1, they had to recast it and the actor who replaced him (Liam McIntyre) as Spartacus was just as terrific! Do yourself a favor and watch this incredible series immediately...you will not be disappointed! It really is the perfect show!",/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,TerribleKatherine,9," After all these years, this show just rocks on!
","I watched the whole Spartacus series back when it first came up and now I'm revisiting it. Still, it does stand it's ground. I had no recollection of Jai Courteney being in the series and I don't like him as an actor but as Varro he is just great. All the acting is great, even when it's over the top, it all just fits together so nicely. Yeah, the GCI is a bit funny now and then but after just a few episodes, I really started to enjoy it. This show is sad, exciting and just pure fun to watch. To Andy: you made such an impression on younger me and you still do. You are a legend.",/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv

23 July 2020,eyeguy72,9," Watching it a second time!
","It's so good I'm watching it all over again. 10 years later it's still holds up. Amid all the glorious violence I had forgotten just how surprisingly emotional this series was.
If you have not seen it, watch it!",/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2022,QueenoftheGoons,10," The best of the best
","Aside from the annoying way of how they talk i love this show. I'm a 32 year old woman and have fond memories of watching it with Dad. He'd watch it upstairs and i'd watch it downstairs and then we'd talk about it in the kitchen. He loved the gore and naked women, i loved the gore, and naked goons. Love Crixus, Gannicus, Julius, and the guy who kills Spartacus his name just slipped me. When Crixus first got slashed open and he went down i was in trauma. It was dad who assured me my goon would be okay and.......he was. Fond memories with Dad, i think of him every time i watch it since he's passed away. He's not around anymore to tell me my goons will be okay.",/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2019,rexcapritarius,9," Captivating!
",This series rocks! It is full of action packed historical fiction plots. As well as plenty of gratuitous nudity! Hehe,/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2020,cinema_forever19,9," You may watch the first episode and want to turn it off, but don't!! Keep watching, it's worth it!!
","The first episode, I have to admit starts off quite underwhelming. Even I had low expectations already... But after a couple more episodes, it gets good... But wait, it gets better, and better, and even better! 300, Gladiator and the original Spartacus ain't got nothing on this epic show!! Even Game of Thrones with it's disappointing final season may have competition with this badassery of show.",/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2012,Leofwine_draca,10," Legendary TV show
","Review of Blood and Sand: After ROME, I've always been on the look out for adult-oriented historical TV series that bring ancient eras to life in all their vivid, bloody glory. SPARTACUS: BLOOD AND SAND came out a couple of years ago, and only now have I caved in to see what all the fuss is about; I'm glad I did, because this gladiator drama is every bit the equal of ROME.",/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv

",This series was promising and I saw it on TV. Even the actress of Xena had an important role.,/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2021,BoulosSoueileh,10," I miss Andy Whitefield
","After the first season you'll notice changing in the main actor ""Spartacus"". That's because Andy Whitefield passed away because of cancer.
The series deserves a try but this is an appreciation post for Andy.",/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2022,strangegeeza,9," If only we had more TV shows like this, Great TV show.
","Hands down this TV show has been my favourite TV show so far. The 1st season sets the back story for Spartacus before proceeding to the next two seasons where upon Spartacus takes out his revenge on the Romans, before then finally facing off the Romans in a epic battle. The story of Spartacus to me should be a story of the ages a story that is truly inspiring both in its historical sense and in this theatrical adaption. This show is very adult so not a show for children, but everything shown is to contextual and in line with the time, period and story so I don't have any problem with any of it, but others might. I highly recommend this TV show to anyone wanting to watch a story of portrayal, revenge, struggle and sacrifice plus more, its great!",/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2022,lan-1688,9," The slaves trembled the Rome
","When Spartacus wisely captured Tiberius and ordered the Romans to gladiatorially fight to tribute to Chris, the roles of the slaves and Romans were switched. The slaves became spectators in the simple improvised gladiatorial arena, invigorated by the blood of their enemies, while the Romans became gladiators and were slain by the slaves. This is however an exhilarating silhouette, but not the end of the story.",/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2012,Andy-296,10," Bloody, sexy and very entertaining - but not for the easily offended
","If you want a series about Roman history, one can watch HBO's Rome (a very fine TV show). If you want to see a trashy and outrageously entertaining TV show with nonstop gore and nudity (both male and female) as well as graphic sex, Spartacus (very loosely based on the history of Ancient Rome's slave gladiator turned rebel leader) should be the choice.",/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv

","Not sure if it's just the times, but haven't cried this much since Bambi. What a series. So much crazed gore and violence wrapped in heroism and lore.",/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,Rainbringerof3000,9," Probably one of the best series I have watched, ever
","I almost wrote this series off in the first episode because the cgi background was so poor in that episode. But I stuck with it,and boy was I glad I did! The story was well written & entertaining, the action thrilling, the acting on point (& you get the distinct impression that everyone is having fun filming) & you end up caring for the characters. I love a period piece & this one's a doozey. Andy was a talent not to be outshone but there were many other actors of note on set too and they give it everything. Violent, so not for kids. But for adults who love fast paced, drama, violence, s*x and history, you cant look away.",/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2021,Crankgorilla,9," You will be entertained
","This is so good. Every player in it was awesome. Crixos is an absolute superstar but they all are. Even all the extra's painted this picture of pure olden time carnage. It's better than you can get in any movie and if you like sword and sandal or ever interesting drama you should check this out. Really well done by all involved. I appreciated it. Lucy Lawless was a queen in this, I'd like to think her Xena confidence helped out. She would have helped a lot of the noobies. She was outstanding. I could write all day about this - soooo good, John Hanna. He's da man.",/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2020,gdonaldson-86399,10," No need for a long review
","The complete series is an absolute masterpiece. As a former Australia producer I am so proud of the most sincere work not only from the cast but also the crew. Based in New Zealand it brings a complete smorgasbord of the great talents from director, producers, cinematography to a unique editing style and I must impress upon the casting just perfect.
To all involved you do yourselves proud and you bring credit to our industry. Job well done!",/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv

22 August 2021,sayanihussain,9," Is it a show? NO! Its pure art
","So my regional netflix added this show a while ago and I was getting recommendation to see it. Initially I was very skeptical as I was not sure about the historical background. I thought its just another show with gladiator type fighting and lot of nudity (I read it in IMDBs section and reviews). After a while I gave it a try, I found first episode boring but continued to watch. And after third expisode when all major characters were introduced and story was making shape I found myself glued towards the screen to anticipate what is going to come next. I liked this show so much that I am watching it second time, we talk about GOT and Breaking Bad, IMO this show deserves equal standing.",/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2022,angel-soha,10," RUTHLESS AND BEAUTIFUL
","Sex nudity and violence is what everyone will tell you about this show...But the story,acting and the message it carries is what makes Spartacus one of the greatest shows ever..A tale of a Legend couldn't have been told in a more spectacular way..After death of Whitefield i thought of to quit watching the show but believe me Liam McIntyre has done equally good job so much so that at times you feel he is really the Spartacus resurrected..Other characters are equally good and they creat such a magic
that you fall in love with the show... Lastly to get an idea about the show without any spoilers...Folks if you loved Gladiator and 300 ..you will find them toothless against the might of SPARTACUS.",/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2010,nikolobg,," So bloody good !!
","This is not a series for everyone and many people will find a lot in it offensive. They will have good cause. If you are under 16 you should not watch it. Why am i so excited by it then: For the ones that want to see fights, blood, brutality, sex, men looking like gods, blood, erotica, excitement, blood, swearing, allot of skulls being bashed, sweat, savagery, arena fights, honor, friendships intrigues, assassinations, and lets not forget some more blood, this is a show for you.",/review/rw2207007/?ref_=tt_urv
