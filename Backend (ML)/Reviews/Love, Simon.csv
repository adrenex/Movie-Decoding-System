","Kimmy is cute, strong, and compassionate, a great blend. She is gullible, but she is also wise and vigilant. Tina Fey's touch of intelligent and strikingly blunt comedy shines through.",/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2020,aprilsfriendorin,7," Funny but also unique
","If you like a 30 Rock style of humor, you'll enjoy this show. There's a lot of fourth wall breaking and just bizarre humor involved. If that's not your style, then obviously don't watch. But if it is, or if you're just looking for a comedy that's different from things you've seen before, then you'll enjoy this one.",/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2015,themadmovieman,," Delightfully weird and consistently hilarious
","I've never been a big binge watcher, but I was so grabbed by this show right from the first episode that I just couldn't stop.",/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2019,TerribleKatherine,10," This show is amazing and I'm going to miss it SO MUCH!!
","I love this show to bits. Fresh, funny, sarcastic and so weird. The chemistry between the cast is great and the characters are so well written. I was upset to learn the show is ending after 4 seasons and I just watched the last episode today. I'm going to miss this brilliant show so much but I hope they'll make at least one Kimmy movie.",/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv

","Kimmy Schmidt (Ellie Kemper) was in the 8th grade when she was kidnapped by Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne (Jon Hamm). She spends the next 15 years in an underground bunker in Indiana with the Reverend and his other captive wives. They are rescued by the police and become media sensations known collectively as the Indiana Mole Women. While doing media in New York, Kimmy leaves the group to strike out on her own. Lillian Kaushtupper (Carol Kane) rents her a basement apartment which she shares with Titus Andromedon (Tituss Burgess). She starts working for rich Jacqueline White (Jane Krakowski) to care for her stepkids.",/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2020,nicholaskutzin,8," Quirky and Cute
","Unbreakable Kimmy Schmitt may not be the best show in the world, but it certainly gets the job done. It's hilarious and you can truly tell how hard the actors worked to make this show fun and likable. Sometimes the jokes may be a little dumb, but it certainly is worth watching. All the characters are so easy to relate to and they are so fun the watch. Some episodes deal with big issues, such as racism, so this is certainly a good show to watch if you need a good comedy that can be serious at times.",/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2015,HermanGomez95,9," A Brief Review: Don't judge the show based on the first episode... Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt gets better... a lot better.
","While not as funny, binge worthy, or all together accessible as her first sitcom, 30 Rock, Tina Fey's second outing as head writer proves to have its own charms. The series may be slow at first, but give it three to four episodes and you'll be hooked. With a cast that gets better with age, writing that goes from zany and out of this world to surprisingly profound and sweet, and a stellar sense of humor, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is the kind of series that improves over time, much like Ms. Fey's first sitcom. The cast includes a zesty Carol Kane, the funny as always Jane Krakowski, 30 Rock Guest alum Tituss Burgess, and our lead Ellie Kemper; these four hilariously colorful players take the normal NBC formula for comedy and make it into something far smarter and much sharper. The writing also manages to succeed beyond my expectations. As a HUGE fan of 30 Rock, I know Ms. Fey can write up a storm. However, I thought it was the comedian perception of Television that made it so fresh. No it's her perception of diversity and identity and all their wonderfulness that makes this show work so well. As I mentioned earlier, the show is funny yes, but also much deeper than the common person will perceive. I'm glad to know that Netflix went for the full two seasons, for this show demands at least that many to get into its full rhythm. Remember, 30 Rock wasn't a masterpiece till season 3 I can't wait to see where the shows is when it hits its third season and trust me there will be a 3rd season.",/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2017,MsReginaPhalange,7," A lighthearted and funny show, but season 3 disappoints
","I'm a little late to the party as I've only watched Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt this year, but I figured it was time to watch it since I'm a fan of Tina Fey and 30 Rock. I like all of the characters, with my favorite being Titus since he has some of the most memorable and hilarious lines of the show. I quickly binge watched seasons 1 and 2 in the matter of days, but it took me a few weeks to get through season 3. I wanted to like it and I was very excited to watch it, but it was honestly a big let down compared to the previous two seasons. The jokes felt forced and I was very unhappy with some of the plot decisions. It felt like major story lines were built up only to be torn apart and it was disappointing to see that happen after spending so much time invested in them. The season 3 finale was a little better and I was relatively happy with how they set up the plot for season 4, but I'm worried they'll just repeat the same mistakes as this time around. Overall, this show is an amusing, feel good comedy and it does bring a smile to my face, I just hope that the writers will have some more focus and direction in the coming seasons.",/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2018,plargreg,10," season 4 ruins it all
",I loved this because i could laugh and forget about contemporary politics but season 4 seems to try to make up for all the other seasons not saying anything which makes it super annoying. Whether you agree or not isnt the issue i just dont watch comedy to be reminded of annoying ass reality so thanks for ruining one of my old fav shows you dumbasses,/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv

8 April 2015,kofila,5," I wanted to love it but I am disappointed
","First of all - I am big fan of 30 rock but this just seemed a bit lost. To be completely honest, I felt that 30 rock kept losing its wit towards the end and I didn't complete watching the whole series. But Tina took some time off and then this show came along, with very promising plot and all... But for me the writing is a bit stiff and many times very ""sitcomy"" and I don't find the jokes and the characters original, to be honest. I have really tried. I have watched it all but it just didn't click with me and I really do believe that it is mediocre at best. There are far more funnier shows to watch, trust me...",/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2019,southdavid,7," Unsustainable Kimmy Schmidt
",2019 sees the end of the Netflix series that began with such fanfare and acclaim but ends with a whimper rather than a bang.,/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2015,bregund,5," I wanted to like this
","I really wanted to like this show, but the writing is all over the map and the situations are goofy and simple-minded. I was expecting something as good as The Office but unfortunately it's on the same level as Scrubs. If they slowed down and took the time to build the characters and the situations, they might create a relatable scenario, but the bi-polar 1930s-style slapstick, jarring transitions, and cookie-cutter character archetypes come together to form an unsatisfying whole; it's like eating a Twinkie for dinner. There's a laugh here and there, but it comes off as accidental rather than intentional. Well, I watched three episodes and I'll stop there.",/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2015,decster98-645-453673,9," Wow.
","What a brilliant, brilliant show. I'm surprised that I'm the first reviewer on here! Seriously though, I began streaming this show just about an hour ago, with netflix's system of 'single-day-season-releases' I've just kept streaming. I'm now up to the third episode and I'm blown away with how funny this show is. Tina fey has always been hilarious to me, and same with Ellie Kemper, so i've been intrigued by this show since it's announcement. This show is, at it's roots, a very funny show, chances are you will laugh a lot during this show. But it's not all about that, this show has several layers, it's got lots of heart and fantastic characters. As I mentioned before, I'm only up to the 3rd episode but this show is showing fantastic promise, I haven't been this invested in a show's pilot in a while. Hilarious story, fantastic acting, great writing, great direction. This looks like a good one, stream it when you get the chance! 9/10 (so far)",/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2015,Audrey_L,4," It doesn't get better, regardless what some people say
",Like one reviewer already noticed - this show uses every stereotype imaginable. Using an Asian guy's name as a verbal pun (a sophomoric one at that) is something I'd expect to see in a sitcom from the sixties and seventies.,/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv

6 April 2019,jpismyname,7," Eccentric, funny
","Four women are rescued from an underground bunker after being kept in there by a sinister man for fiteen years. Now, that might sound like the plot of a new suspense or dark series, but it's actually the premise of this sitcom.",/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2019,Red_Identity,," One of the greatest TV sitcoms of all time
","I personally believe this is one of the best TV comedies ever, for the pure reason that it's pretty consistently hilarious, wacky, and oh so entertaining. It's almost to the level of 30 Rock, and that's high praise.",/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2015,Gvakarian,," Such an unlikely combination yields a brilliant result
","Honestly, the two reviews that have been written so far are unreasonable. Unbreakable Kimmy Schimdt is by no means average, poor or unfunny. It shines through in it's originality, tactful balancing of humour and satire and it's absolutely endearing. The premise is strange and does not suggest it's a comedy even for a black comedy it seems like a stretch. A woman escapes a cult after being imprisoned for 15 years and starts a new life in New York City. The pilot begins as the women are being rescued and brought back out to the world after 15 years of imprisonment. It's a very unconventional idea for a comedy yet it exceeds expectations. Ellie Kemper, the subject of this show, is wonderfully quirky, sweet and her performance is enjoyable to watch.",/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2015,linspencer92,10," A Must-See for Anyone with a Quirky Sense of Humor
","It started slow. I honestly only watched it because it was advertised on Netflix and I thought it was an interesting plot. The pilot had me cracking a smile but it wasn't great. But because I was lazy, I let the next episodes play. I have to say I was glad that I did!",/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2015,matt-silesia,8," A show that is worth the watch
",Firstly a heads up: I like Tina Fey. I like her way of seeing the world and her ability to make fun of very subtle things in a very blunt way. And I love 30 Rock. If you do too you'll appreciate Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. If you don't you'll fall in love with Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and watch all 7 seasons of 30 Rock in one sitting.,/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv

23 September 2015,phd_travel,5," The main character isn't funny as the supporting ones
",The reason this comedy isn't that good is that the main character Kimmy Schmidt is annoying and it's painful to watch the smiling and corny overacting. Quite a bit of what she gets up to is juvenile. The secondary characters like Jane Krakowski's socialite second wife and the Vietnamese friend provide some of the actual laughs. The gay room mate isn't as funny as he could be. ,/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2015,kleemannmax,10," Tina Fey's comedic brilliance does not disappoint. Lovable quirky characters, surprisingly honest and extraordinary writing make 'Kimmy Schmidt' a must-see comedy
","There's a lot to what seems to be a simple story of an Indiana Mole Woman moving to New York to finally experience life how she wants it. Tina Fey and her writing team already proved themselves with 30 Rock which had some of the best written comedy of all time with what is in my opinion one of the best television characters of all time, Jack Donaghy, and while Kimmy Schmidt is a different approach to her formula it still very much feels like something from the minds of the creators of 30 Rock. The Jokes are still fantastic and smart, with Pop Culture references to an extreme and quirky humor that goes along very well to the silly tone of the show itself.",/review/rw3197578/?ref_=tt_urv
