12 November 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Entertaining!!
",I didn't really know what to expect with Warrior Nun but I gave it a chance and found it to be a pretty good show. I think season 2 was even better than the first. It's a pretty fun show with plenty of action. Most of the people leaving bad reviews are people saying they only watched 10 minutes or maybe an episode but base an entire series off that. Who does that? Who only watches 10 minutes and then bases an entire series off that? Not only that but then takes the time to come write a negative review? The good news is that it was popular enough that it was renewed for a second season and hopefully a third after how good this past season was. If you're looking for a new fun sci-fi/fantasy show to binge watch then give this a try.,/review/rw5885350/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Alba Baptista is absolutely beautiful!
","Sorry, but I have to start by saying how beautiful Alba Baptista is. It's almost distracting how beautiful she is. Now, as far as Warrior Nun goes...I actually enjoyed it a lot more than I expected to. For some reason I thought it was show aimed at tweens but I couldn't of been more wrong. This is a fun supernatural show for anyone. It's about a young woman who wakes up in the morgue after dying and has newfound powers that help in the battle between good and evil. It may start off a little slow for some but after a few episodes it really picks up and very interesting. All the characters are well written with interesting back stories. Alba Baptista is terrific as the lead and has a very bright future. I'm looking forward to this new season coming out.",/review/rw5885350/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2020,paul_haakonsen,7," This was actually impressive...
","I didn't even know that this series existed before stumbling upon it on Netflix one evening by browsing through the contents on Netflix. The synopsis for ""Warrior Nun"" sounded interesting, so I sat down to watch it.",/review/rw5885350/?ref_=tt_urv

13 July 2020,Pairic,8," Fantasy Thriller
","Warrior Nun: A secret order of nuns dedicated to combating demons, generally just the wraith type which possess people but occasionally more fearsome ones. Their leader is killed during an ambush and her internal halo is transplanted into a dead girl. Ava (Alba Baptista), reanimating her and bestowing superpowers on her. The Halo has been passed down for centuries and was meant for another nun who is now jealous. We get nuns armed with crossbows, swords, rifles. These are Ninja Nuns. There is a conniving Cardinal and a lot of Church intrigue. A scientist is also involved who has her own plans for Church relics made from Divinium (a bit like unobtainium). Ava runs away and teams up with a gang of young grifters. Great combat scenes, well imagined demons. The RCC Hierarchy don't come out of this smelling of roses so it may substantially differ from the comic book series it's based on. Good fantasy thriller. 8/10. Ten episodes, on Netflix.",/review/rw5885350/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2022,diazabigail-92214,10," FIGHT FOR SEASON 3!
",I literally cannot handle not getting a season 3 after the season 2 finale. This is such a unique story and I love all the characters. Please don't let the story end here! Ava has gone through so much throughout the show and she has grown as a character as well. We see how much the characters love each and if it is a possibility for there to be resurgence of Mary then that is what I expect once we get season 3. This show is incredibly underrated and if I could fund season 3 myself I literally would so please watch it because there are so many ways this story could end. I found myself absolutely fawning over avatrice but also the way all the other characters supported them!,/review/rw5885350/?ref_=tt_urv

",The war between God and Evil is on. Ninja nuns with a divine power and a kickass attitude hold the line and maintain the balance against the power of darkness.,/review/rw5885350/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2022,saletaamelia,8," Do not sleep on this!!
","This show is Soooo good! Other than having lesbian nuns, warrior nun is such such a badass show like the cinematography, the scenarios, THE STUNTS! The emotions are beautifully executed, so sapphic, the whole plot is amazing and it keeps on building up form season 1 to 2! Alba Baptista character ""Ava"" is so well developed and her chemistry with Kristina Tonteri-Young ""Beatrice"" is absolutely perfect, I'm in love with them.",/review/rw5885350/?ref_=tt_urv

","WILD! I admired watching this series, i hope there will be season 2!!! I enjoyed every single episode. It's exciting! I highly recommend it! Plz Netflix create more seasons of it!!!",/review/rw5885350/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2022,mpurnima-08153,10," It's a one good watch!!
","This is one of those series who had me hooked from starting. Of course it is straightforward good vs evil but that's what I liked about it. Here and there it becomes a little slow but in the end I enjoyed it. So definitely a watch!! And If you think that its all just something religious thing , its not. They have all that setup as the series is based on comic but believe me its a lot more than the religious talk. Now talking about characters, I really liked Ava's character and Alba Baptista did a wonderful job portraying her. Same goes for the Beatrice's and Mary's character. Its worth a shot show!!",/review/rw5885350/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2022,Cemil-Alyanak,10," Exceptional
","Please please give us Season 3. This series is exceptionally unique, well-produced, shows women's strength, is filmed in Europe, has actors with exceptional chemistry, I could go on. Congratulations Netlix for such an amazing show. To be frank, at first the combination of common vernacular with a divine supernatural theme felt wrong. Instead, it turns out that it works so very well. It feels both divine and modern. Last little note is about the fight sequences. Both the choreography and the execution of the fights is outstanding. And don't get me started on the final episode... epic, truly epic.",/review/rw5885350/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2022,ellakeresteci,10," SEASON 2 IS INCREDIBLE AND DESERVES A SEASON 3 !!
","Season 2 went over and beyond my expectations and it was an incredible season and the Warrior Nun fandom is super dedicated even with Netflix not doing any promos or anything just the fandom using there voices and being badasses to give this show a very much well deserved season 3!! Season 1 was a stepping point to get the fandom going and Season 2 just blew everyone including me away. With celebrities talking about the show and asking when season 3 is, is incredible!! I really hope Netflix renews Warrior Nun as it should be!! Everyone seeing this please watch Warrior Nun multiply times and tell everyone you know to watch it!!",/review/rw5885350/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2022,susanxx-76-348573,9," Wowser!
","After trying the first episode, I was dubious as to whether this was going to be worth watching but I persevered and was I glad I did! How the heroine ended up being the Warrior Nun takes you on a journey meeting many characters and hearing their stories and how they arrived there. Your opinion or dislike of some characters changes as each episode unfolds and those you thought you could trust turn out to be the baddies and some you thought were baddies to out to be the good guys. The nuns fight scenes are super and Shotgun Mary reminds you of Mazakeen, another motorcycle riding, leather clad, weapon wielding, kick ass fighter that was a pivotal character in Lucifer. Stick with the slow start, it's well worth it!",/review/rw5885350/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,elgsdyr,8," Unexpectedly decent
","I went into this with absolutely no prior knowledge and expected it to be crap, but ended up enjoying it quite a bit. And even more surprising as this is obviously written for teenage girls and I'm about as far from being that as you can. Of course, the target audience considered, many elements are simplistic but I can easily overlook that and enjoy the story, which believes in ""itself"" and the world it's building and (almost) never loses touch with its premise to fall into pitfalls of clich√©s and irrelevant messages that disconnects the viewer. Nice build-up of the main story and mystery, and good pacing and timing throughout. I'm really curious to see where season 2 will take us.",/review/rw5885350/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2022,levitak,10," This started out as a fun show but it became a masterpiece
","Season 1 was a fun well produced show with great acting and an interesting story but season 2 ? I haven't seen such drastic rise in quality since Terminator 2 completely blew away the first part . Season 2 is just a masterpiece . The gorgeous scenery of Europe , the fantastic choreography ( seriously the fight scenes are better then quite a few Marvel movies ) , the beautiful acting it's all just well say I am going to say it . A master piece",/review/rw5885350/?ref_=tt_urv
