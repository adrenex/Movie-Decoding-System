27 June 2017,Jared_Andrews,5," It's Exactly What You Expect
","Before we sit down in the theater, we know pretty much exactly what happens. Two girls go scuba diving in a shark cage and wind up a trapped in said cage 47 meters below the surface. Since they aren't experts, we know how they will react. Then sharks show up. Since they are sharks in a scary movie, we know how they will react. There is no real room for surprises.",/review/rw4630732/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2018,vailsy,6," as an 'experienced diver' ... I quite liked it!
","Most 'experienced divers' reviewing the movie here, who want to share their diving knowledge and tell us about the technical holes in the plot, are missing a huge detail.. the ending. It reveals BIG SPOILER that most of the movie is the hallucination of one of the girls while she is trapped at the bottom in the cage suffering from nitrogen narcosis, the other girl disappears quite quickly so all the ascents etc don't happen. So we can forget our dive tables and decompression times, and it becomes a little bit easier to suspend our disbelief for the tank swapping next to, for example Jaws, where a shark propels itself fully out of the water and sinks a large boat",/review/rw4630732/?ref_=tt_urv

","Had a flick through the comments here and I saw a bunch of 1's from people complaining about coast guard tactics, ocean safety and even ""shark behaviour"". IT'S A MONSTER SURVIVAL MOVIE! Just calm down and watch it for what it is.
Lame and uninteresting characters, a boat, ocean, sharks. Followed by cheap jump scares.",/review/rw4630732/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,7," A cage dive you'd not want to be in.
","How often do you watch a film from this genre and are made to watch 90 minutes of bad acting, unrealistic sharks, poor camerawork etc, my expectations weren't too high, and I for one was pleasantly surprised. This film is actually really well made, it's very solid, it's well acted, and it manages to generate both terror and claustrophobia, in a way I wasn't expecting. That ending also, talk about out of the Blue ;-) Beautifully filmed, superb location work, sharks that although maybe a little out of character to say the least certainly looked good, and of course added to the terror.",/review/rw4630732/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's summer again;  it's a shark movie.  Lisa and Kate are two sisters on holiday in Mexico with one grieving a lost relationship and the other looking for fun.  Against their better judgement they go shark cage diving 5 metres below a vessel that looks like it should have been in the salvage yard 20 years ago.  After a mechanical failure the cage plummets down to the sea bed.....

9 June 2018,brunoproductions,6," ONE YEAR LATER AND I STILL ENJOY THIS MOVIE
","I actually caught this in the theater and again a year later at home. Reviews are mixed with this film, but I actually enjoyed this movie. Mandy Moore's acting is always a breath of fresh air and Claire Holt didn't have trouble carrying the film along. Yes it's a shark movie, but what makes this flick a stand out, is the fact the sharks aren't the only threat to the girls survival. It got a few jumps and a sudden episode of claustrophobia from me. Which I guess is a good thing. Moore's freaky smile in the end makes one lasting impression but one burning question though for me is... WHERE THE HELL DID THE SHARKS DISAPPEAR TO IN THE FINAL RESCUE SCENE ?!?",/review/rw4630732/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2017,mitchel1986,8," Solid, entertaining movie keeps you entertained until the very end, and IGNORE the dive experts please
","OK, so this movie was quite nice! I saw it at a sneak preview, had no expectations and was surprised in a positive way. Its no Oscar-winner, the constant moaning of the girls kinda irritated me a few times but overall...scary, but not in an 'average shark movie' way, some nice twist and just fun!",/review/rw4630732/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2017,jtindahouse,8," Surprisingly good
","I remember when 'Open Water' came out back in 2003 a lot of my friends hated it, yet I found myself loving every second of it, and in particular the ending. '47 Meters Down' is a similar film in a lot of ways, only with faster pacing and a little more action and a little less chat (although still quite a lot of chat). And I found myself really enjoying it. ",/review/rw4630732/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2018,Leofwine_draca,5," Single location sharks
","47 METRES DOWN is yet another shark-based thriller with a decent central premise: a couple of American teenagers go cage-diving but have an accident which strands them deep below the surface in a damaged cage and surrounded by flesh-hungry sharks. I'm typically a fan of single location films but this one fails to engage very much with the viewer thanks to the middling script which creates a couple of irritating, unsympathetic lead characters. On the plus side, the eerie and isolated setting is effectively portrayed, and the CGI shark effects are very realistic indeed. But the end result can't help but feel a bit pat and that silly twist doesn't help much.",/review/rw4630732/?ref_=tt_urv

2 April 2020,Coventry,3," In Too Deep
","I honestly don't want to sound too harsh, but the main problem with a film like ""47 Meters Down"" is, well, that it is what it is! You know what to expect and you get exactly that, so don't count on any surprise-twists or shocking revelations. The film's poster and synopsis promise a tale about two hot sisters vacationing in Mexico and deciding to go cage-diving to spot Great White Sharks. Naturally, their little excursion goes wrong. The crummy cable of the shabby crane on the ramshackle boat snaps, and the cage with the two girls in it sinks straight to the bottom, which is - you guessed it - 47 meters down. On the ocean floor they struggle with shortages of oxygen, bizarre hallucinations, flesh wounds and up close and personal encounters with ferocious sharks. That last danger is basically what they paid for, so they shouldn't nag. ""47 Meters Down"" is beyond formulaic. Not only the plot is rudimentary, everything else is boringly conventional: the sisters are complete opposites, Murphy's Law applies, and the shark-attacks are meticulously timed at typical moments when suspense flicks like these require a jump-moment. The underwater photography is dark and unclear, and the sharks are merely just footnotes in the rivalry-between-sisters plot. On second thought, I do want to sound harsh: it's a lousy film and a waste of time!",/review/rw4630732/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2016,theshadowrunner,7," Pretty solid!
","For a scary shark flick I found it totally worked. Of course the intro, party scene & boys are what you'd expect for this genre, and had me wondering if I'd make it to the end due to all the cliché.",/review/rw4630732/?ref_=tt_urv

26 June 2017,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,1," ""47 Meters Down""- Completely lacking in bite. A shallow, condescending cash-grab that barely qualifies as a 'movie.'
","What did I just watch? No, seriously. What the heck did I just watch? I'm pretty sure it was supposed to be a movie. But it doesn't really fall into any tangible definition of ""movie"" that I can think of, outside of the most basic- that being that it's made up of moving images. Other than that... this wasn't really a ""movie"" so to speak. There's no characters. There's no compelling build-up of story. No logical progression of events. No sense of urgency or suspense. No deeper meanings, nor substantial surface-level thrills. It's just... a rough assembly of moving images where a shark sometimes pops up for cheap ""Boo!"" scares.",/review/rw4630732/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2021,aidanratesmovies,3," Here we go again...
","Although it can have a handful of somewhat intense moments, 47 Meters Down sadly proves to be nothing but another generic shark movie, and to be frank, a rather pathetic attempt at that. I'll start with the films strengths, that being why most of the people will watch the film, for the suspense. I feel all the suspenseful moments in the film come from the situations under water, and not at all the danger of the sharks themselves. The sharks throughout the film are almost comically thrown in there, so much to the point, that I laughed whenever they came on screen. I enjoyed the claustrophobic nature it had been trapped in the cage under water, not knowing what to do or where to go, but our lead characters are too stupid to truly be concerned for, and the lead actresses hardly capable of carrying the film to the lengths it needs them too. The acting is quite bad, incredibly overdramatic, silly at times, and the dialogue is atrocious. Besides the sharks literally being a joke upon the screen, the worst part of the film is hands down the twist ending, which is not only frustrating, but absolutely ridiculous, and completely unnecessary. The film is unbelievable, dull at times, and simply too stupid to handle the fear of its somewhat interesting premise. In the end, 47 Meters Down is probably left better at the bottom of the ocean, than it was in major theaters across the globe.

","Two 30 year old sisters are looking for kicks in the cheap side of Mexico. Mandy Moore is 33, and Claire Holt is 29. They actually look older. The two sisters hook up with a couple of local townies, and they are all excited to go on a boat to look at sharks. The build-up to getting on the boat took about 40 minutes, and it was pretty boring.",/review/rw4630732/?ref_=tt_urv

I secretly love MM, but when the writers, producers, and director take on a project like this (diving w/ sharks), they really need to AT LEAST have an inkling about how diving affects people and shark behavior...

4 August 2016,hcjv6,8," Blows The Shallows out of the water !
","When you consider the amount of crap shark films that keep popping up it's pretty wise to be cautious about watching any........this one however is more than worth a watch........and considering ide never even heard of it until I stumbled on it filled me with dread as I pressed the 'play' button. Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised.....for me it knocked socks off that tripe The Shallows........there is plenty of shark action and it really keeps you on the edge of your seat with the sheer terror and suspension involved. I never go into story telling in my reviews as that's what trailers are for etc, but far as im concerned it's a solid and believable tale that in all fairness could have been done way before now with a bigger budget and better actors. If you can grit your teeth for the first 15 mins and ignore the ott and annoying acting of one of the girls then you should enjoy this film........don't want to spill anymore........enjoy......and I really don't care if you find this review useful.......just saying my piece ;)",/review/rw4630732/?ref_=tt_urv

10 February 2018,Aaron1375,6," Watch two incredibly stupid girls plunge into shark infested waters
","Me and my fiance decided to watch this film as we had watched Jaws 3 the night before. Thought it would be interesting and it was entertaining as it was one of those movies you talk over as the characters in the film proceed to not use their minds at all and make poor decision after poor decision! I am betting this film was originally going to be a direct to DVD type film, but they ended up releasing it in theaters and considering it cost only about six million to make and went on to gross 44 million I would say they made a good decision. I am glad I did not see this in theaters and rather just watched it on Netflix as it was okay to some degree, but I could not have made fun of it in the theater like I did in my fiance's living room. The movie just begs a person to yell criticisms at the two main characters!",/review/rw4630732/?ref_=tt_urv
