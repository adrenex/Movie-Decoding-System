26 June 2022,ernestrx,5," A Toutch of Woke
","Not a great watch, but not totally bad. Certainly has the feel of a big budget movie and a caste to support it. A predictable story that ticks the ""Requirement"" of the current wave in Hollywood. What the point was in revealing two old gay men in the story, I can not understand, adds zero to the story and can only be understood by the studio. At least the hero rides into the sunset.",/review/rw8685740/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2022,nogodnomasters,4," I got the murderer
","The film takes place in a dead gold mining town of Yellowstone, Montana, 1881. Robert Dunnigan (Zach McGowan) discovers gold and immediately leaves his wife behind to go to town and tell everyone, and bed Isabel (Aimee Garcia) is favorite prostitute. He soon turns up dead and a stranger (Isaiah Mustafa ) is blamed as some of his gold is discovered in his room. The mystery of who did it becomes completely known at an hour and twenty minutes into the feature.",/review/rw8685740/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2022,Luv2Spooge,1," How many times do I have to write this review?
","Nothing other people haven't said. It is boring, long, and the plot is very convoluted. There are some nice action scenes with the shootout that comes at the end, but other than that it is predictable. But of course, what made it a complete bust is from beginning to the end filled with ""the message.""",/review/rw8685740/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2022,paul_haakonsen,3," Was there a point to this storyline?...
","I must admit that the movie's cover/poster definitely seemed interesting, and the fact that there was names like Gabriel Byrne, Thomas Jane and Richard Dreyfuss on the cast list definitely had me interested. So as I had the opportunity to sit down and watch the 2022 Western ""Murder at Yellowstone City"" from writer Eric Belgau and director Richard Gray, of course I did so.",/review/rw8685740/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2022,Boristhemoggy,3," Another payday movie for someone

26 June 2022,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,1," Boring & dumb
","Despite the famous cast of actors in this film, I struggled with this borefest. The screenplay and direction was pretty bad. Even the cinemotography wasn't remarkable. There are characters that immediately call our attention then does something stupid (I won't mention what) and gets killed within the first 10 minutes. As a western, it might be the worse I've seen.",/review/rw8685740/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2022,cdcrb,7," a real old fashioned western
","For those to young to know, 1950's tv was full of westerns. At one time 15 of the top 30 shows were western themed. So if you are interested in what we watched back then here is the movie for you. Its a 50's western to the hilt. Everything but the white hat for the good guy. Thomas jane in this case. Its way more violent, of course, and brought up to ""date"" with people of color in main roles. Westerns died out in the 60's replaced by all in the family and mash. So if you are interested in what america was watching on tv 70 years ago, give this a try.",/review/rw8685740/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2022,kanifuker-84708,9," Not Too Shabby
",Not too shabby at all. Not a fan of TV movies but this was actually quite good and worth a watch and maybe another watch in 5-10yrs time. Good cast here and the acting was on par too. If you like a who done it kinda movie mixed with a western then you'll probably enjoy this one.,/review/rw8685740/?ref_=tt_urv

25 June 2022,sitstill,2," UNFORGIVABLE
","I don't know how a film makes it out of editing in such a state, how the corny bumper sticker lines are all left in. It screams of someone with too much money to waste and little talent to spare. Made for tv styling, too bright, not gritty or visceral and full of huge plot holes and atrocious dialogue. Give it a miss.",/review/rw8685740/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2022,solojere,8," Entertaining Enough
","Murder at Yellowstone City is a murder mystery/western set in 1881. The film revolves around Cicero, a former slave that arrives at Yellowstone City the same day as (you guessed it) a man is murdered. Of course, Cicero being black, is accused of the murder, and the rest of the film is about finding out who the actual murderer is and cleaning Cicero's name. I won't give anything away as I think this is one of those movies you have to watch for yourself. However, I will say it's entertaining both as a western and murder mystery. At times the film is a bit slow and somewhat predictable. However, the film makes up for its shortcomings with its characters and by the fact that it is also a pretty brutal story that kept me interested until the very end. Also, the film's setting really felt like a real western city like Yellowstone City. Lastly, Anna Camp stole the show as Alice Murphy. I love Anna Camp, and I have to say she killed it in this as she portrays Alice as both religious and a strong, gritty woman who knows how to take care of herself. I know that recently she has been trying to branch out to new types of roles, and I think this shows that she can play a wide range of characters. It wasn't the greatest movie ever, but it was entertaining enough, and I recommend checking it out for Anna Camp. Murder at Yellowstone City is a murder mystery/western set in 1881.

","This is the best Western I have seen since News of the World. Good storytelling and a solid cast led by the commendably credible Bryne, Hale and Camp. A strong sense of setting (though 'city' reflects the dreams of the settlers, not the reality!) and period (love the stage coach!).",/review/rw8685740/?ref_=tt_urv

","The camera movement is clumsy, but there are many very good things in the film, such as the flow of life and the characters who are like the style. The script is good and the movie imitates the great western movies correctly. The mezzanines are also correct. And the suspense of the film is unique. The movie poster is also a very correct poster.",/review/rw8685740/?ref_=tt_urv

Look at the ratings from the majority of IMDB viewers and ask yourself ""Who Do I Believe??!!! "" I can not understand how the algorithms give this movie a 5.1 rating. Also I don't understand how several reviews have HALF the number of characters as does my review and I have to aimlessly add words to meet the 600 word 'required characters' to have my Review/Rating published??!!!
