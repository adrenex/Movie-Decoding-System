6 November 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,6," Showed so much promise.
","Very much a film of two halves, a very good first half, and a pretty awful second half.",/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2020,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," So close, yet so far
","Beautifully shot with great cinematography, but the story gradually disappoints because its thematic ambitions add more clutter than depth to a story that's most effective at its simplest. The convoluted ""twist"" either needed to be omitted, or expanded upon with another 15+ minutes. It's as if the budget ran out and everyone just wrapped it up as fast as they could with no regard for a cohesive storyline. It's a shame, because it had potential. It's a generous 6/10 from me.",/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2020,paul_haakonsen,7," Now this was one interesting combination of horror and war movie....
","Well, when I sat down to watch ""Ghosts of War"", I must say that I wasn't particularly thrilled or excited. Why? Well, usually World War II movies and horror tend to not be an overly great combination. But still, I hadn't already seen this 2020 movie, much less actually heard about it, so of course I found the time to sit down and watch it.",/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2020,TheUrbanIntrovert,5," What a stupid ending
","As I started watching I just kept thinking why all the negative reviews, this is one of the best war/horror movies. Interesting premise, good acting, chilling atmosphere. I just loved it; but as the movie got to the end, it turned complete 180 & made a fool out of it's audience,the twist was just out of nowhere & completely ridiculous. It's as if the writer hated writing this movie & wanted it to fail. It would've been a fine supernatural horror movie if it stickied to what it started out with; but no, the writer had to subvert the audience expectation. He must've been thinking he was so brilliant to come up with this lame ending. God, what a disappointment, an hour and half down the toilet all because of the ending. A perfectly fine horror movie ruined because the writer had to write this stupid nonsensical ending. What a waste of time & talent.",/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2020,Xavier_Stone,4," Intriguing start, but fizzles out completely
",The first half of this movie is actually interesting and this movie blends a WWII theme with a paranormal theme quite well. However after the initial setup has passed this movie stalls and can't seem to find out how to best continue the action or wrap up an ending. Some jump scares and a few creepy scenes but nothing overly engaging or worth noting.,/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2020,lathe-of-heaven,8," Very cleverly written and well produced. Intriguing concept if you stay with it...
","I cannot understand the low ratings here. Seriously... To me personally this is a very rarely well conceived film where you can tell a lot of thought went into it. It most certainly isn't your usual quickie slam/bang Horror film, but I feel that it is quite well written, acted, and executed. I KNOW that the ending is very divisive and about 1/2 of the people won't like it and about half (like me : ) REALLY love it!",/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2020,mugwamp-983,6," It's not *that* bad
","If you like war horrors such as The Objective, Trench 11, or The Bunker you will be OK with this. Its competently acted. Actually Kyle Gallner the lead from the mini-series ""Interrogation"" has a major supporting role in this movie. He is a good fit as the enigmatic squad sniper and its worth watching just for him. The horror effects seem a little cheesed but there is a reason for that. The movie has a decent twist to the plot, and for that reason I urge you to stop reading the reviews and watch the movie, as people are saying too much around here.",/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2020,travispetrillo,6," What the heck
","So much promise in this film. Good acting, great setting and location, pretty much everything a quality film needs, just to fall off at the end.",/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2020,Martipee,7," Wait for the end
","Interesting movie with a good amount of action and mystery. Good story with lots to expect but falls a bit short overall.
But its the ending which is memorable for all the wrong reasons.....basically there isn't one and would benefit from someone explaining it. Not a waste of time, but definitely unsatisfactory because of this.",/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2020,MinistryofDoom,5," Would've been a good film had the ending not ruined it
","Ghosts of War started out great. It felt like it could be the prefect combination of Band of Brothers and House on Haunted Hill. The premise is simple: U.S. World War 2 soldiers ordered to hold down a strategic location in France, which happens to be a haunted chateau where Nazi soldiers previously committed horrible crimes. I really had high hopes for this film but as it progressed those hopes diminished. The setting is great and the film relies on appropriately creepy atmospheric tension. I mean they're in a really big creepy castle full of strange occurrences. Whats not to like about that? On top of that, the main cast of soldiers were likable. I enjoyed seeing Theo Rossi, who you might recognize as Shades from Marvel Studios/Netflix' Luke Cage series. Alan Ritchson, Brenton Thwaites, and Kyle Gallner, my favorite of the group who played U.S. army sniper Tappert, where all very good.",/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv

20 July 2020,jez-17594,7," Perfectly watchable, people are always too hard.
",I really don't know what people think they're entitled to see every time they choose a movie. Whoever was responsible for this movie gave it their best shot. Great care was clearly taken in the photography and set design. A story that's a little different with actors who give it their all. Give it a break.,/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2020,joiningjt,9," Ignore the haters, great story with phenomenal acting!!
","Another movie that people over think or expect Shakespeare on film when it's a horror with a small budget. Let's sum it up, great cinematography, great acting, great story. Great special effects, only flaw is bad ending. The ending leaves questions I just ended it with I felt the writer thought. I was extremely entertained through the whole film it features excellent acting by a mostly unheard of crew but throughly enjoyed it. Was nice to see billy Zane again hes an extremely Underrated actor even though it's not a big role. Watch it and ignore the haters who obviously dont get good movies and expect a mediocre ending.",/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2020,mbnn,5," Good start, ending just....
","So the start of this movie was pretty good, acting very good, great story.
Then suddenly it turns things around and you get to know the 'real' story. However, at the very end they just 'stop' the movie and that's it.",/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2020,lopezpatricia-06139,10," Totally original with a fabulous twist
",It's rare these days to find a genuine horror/ ghost flick. This is solid with non of the amateur shaky iPhone footage that cheap filmmakers rely on these days. Really great cinematography and decent cgi.,/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2021,kosmasp,8," Soldiers will be soldiers
","There is no pun intended in that summary line - there may be one in it and I may have planned and planted it there, but ... actually that does sound like intention. Something the movie also knows about. Because there is what you see and what the intention behind it all is. Something a few people may not like or accept in the end (another pun).",/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2020,ReliableReview,9," Brilliant ending!
",I have absolutely no idea why people are complaining about the ending. I absolutely thought it was brilliant. In fact I liked the ending so much I'm giving it a 9. Without the twist ending I would have scored it a 7. I like a movie that subverts genre so you can't predict where it's going. To tell more would spoil the fun. I enjoyed it so much I went back and re-watched it multiple times. That's how good it is!!!!,/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2020,pjlfn,5," Such a weird ending
","This movie started ok. Good acting, good plot, good decor, even the storyline was unusual and a great new idea for a ghost movie.
However, I only have one thing to say about the ending...W...T...F...!!!.
Maybe I missed something, but if that ending would have been different, I would have given 9/10. Too bad !!!",/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2020,loeikat,8," Many levels, very interesting!
","I enjoy how things evolve in this movie. When you think you know, maybe you don't, maybe you do.
For me it's a great movie. No error in the casting, no problem with the story. On the contrary, it's well filmed, and overall very well done.",/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv

","Okay as a combat Iraq war veteran, I found myself totally understanding this movie for what is worth.
The story was intense and confusing, which I like!
The ending got me, loved the ending crazy I don't think that could happen BUT anything is possible I do know doctors are using Mushrooms and Psychoanalysis to help control War time Ptsd so it's not that far out.. give it try watch the movie!",/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2021,baunacholi-86159,5," Really?
","(Spoiler Right ahead!)
Its all just a dream - or artificial coma?
A grim WWII setting and quite some cruel scenes at the start. The obligatory group of politically correct and diverse teenagers is in this case a group of soldiers. The dark country side manor replaced with a French chateau... soon things become spooky with a quite high number of jump scares. the group of 5 (soon 4) tries to solve the mystery / haunting of the family who used to own the place. But suddenly the twist appears and our WWII gang, who was actually fighting in Afghanistan & became part of a PTSD Programm, Need to fight a curse which was not at all part of the cure... so, the group is sent back to WWII. Sounds rushed and a bit confusing?... On the positive side there's an engaging cast and the Creative idea to try out new things. I'd have loved to see less ingredients/genres mixed up but pls find out yourself.",/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2022,bgaiv,5," You should probably read the spoilers first
","There is a twist that's far beyond a plot twist, it's a genre switch from horror to sci-fi way late in the movie. There are hints that things aren't as they seem all along but you can't possibly anticipate the genre shift.",/review/rw8354124/?ref_=tt_urv
