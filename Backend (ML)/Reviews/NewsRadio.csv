16 March 2016,s3276169,8," Yards of gritty Australian character....
","Jack Irish is a detective show with yards of gritty, very Australian character. ",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2016,tomsview,7," More is less
","I loved the first three ""Jack Irish"" movies, they just went from strength to strength.",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2016,wynne-1,10," Jack is back!
","Australian author Peter Temple's series of detective novels about Jack Irish have been lighting up television screens since 2012, when the first two adaptations were broadcast. An immediate hit, a third Jack Irish telefilm was broadcast in 2014.",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2020,phlbrq58,7," Loved the films, disliked s1, s2 is back to film quality
","I like a lot of the Oz tv and film I see. The Jack Irish films were fun, in large part, because of the supporting ensemble, many familiar to me from other productions. S 2 puts the film gang back together and is much better for it. S1 I rated 5, S2 rate 8 so 7 overall.",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2016,don-damon,9," Great show from down under
","For an Australian crime show, this is by far the one of the best. I like Guy Pearce and the supporting cast. I started watching Jack Irish the movies versions last year. I was pleasantly surprised that they made it into a TV series. It is a great watch, because it is so not like any other show on television. I'm hoping for more, a second season and continue on from there. This is one television show that should be aired in the United States. It deserves a larger audience.",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2018,ikanboy,7," Gets the quirky confused with the serious.
","The show has it's merits as it attempts to have the quirky comedic side story parallel the serious detective story. The quirky side has characters and plot lines that go from inane to stupid, the detective side has serious business going on. Unfortunately the inane and stupid too often migrate to the serious side. The police are either invisible or incompetent, the bad guys get to be bad without consequences episode after episode, and poor old Marta Dusseldorp gets hung out to dry (luckily she has a much better gig in Sydney circa 1950's).
Jack seems confused more than not, and manages to get himself nearly killed every episode, and the cops just laugh. And they're not even shooting for satire!",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2021,mstylianou7,8," Fitzroy!
","This show is like a diamond in the rough! Mystery combined with danger and violence done very well. Guy Pearce is good, playing second fiddle to the locations of iconic Fitzroy, Melbourne.",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2018,Ralindon0,10," Outstanding in every way
","I'm sure many agree that the writing, acting, direction and overall storyline are simply excellent. What really appealed to me, however, were the side stories. In most shows they are annoying and irrelevant, but the story lines related to race horses, the old footballers in the pub, the carpenter, and others make this a truly complete and enjoyable ""universe.""",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2021,jldowsing,9," The sentimental bloke from old Fitzroy
","I'd long had the intention to watch Jack Irish, having missed the boat when the three telemovies were aired and the subsequent series. Finally I got stuck in, and there I remained glued to every instalment.",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2019,myriamlenys,8," entertaining thriller series from Down Under
","(Review based on watching the whole of the season with the ""Via crucis"" plot, which I suppose was the first season.)",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2019,dowachubub,9," Great view of Australian culture
","Great actors and actresses, they all play phenomenal roles. A very good mix of comedy and crime with expected and unexpected outcomes. Watched the 3 movies and both series in 5 days.",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2020,phlbrq58,7," A sullen teenager is such a tired subplot device
","I like J I for the obvious reasons. Intriquing stories, likeable ensemble, OZ/NZ in general. But I am very tired of disaffected youths providing frustrating plot developments in a most cliche manner. S2 introduces a character that's nearly worse than Rusty from Major Crimes!
We've seen this character repeatedly and its so frustrating. My temptation to slap the smirk out of them is not pleasant or much in line with my experience of todays' yuuts. Its just lazy writing!
Season 2 is more enjoyable than S1 despite the disaffected kid and a grafted on horse racing subplot. That adds charm and gives the supporting crowd we like do fun stuff.",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2021,phlbrq58,7," S2 is better than 1 but not as good as the movies
","I really dislike the contrivance of troubled, pain in the a** kids delivering dramatic complications. I like so many things about Jack and his ensemble but both seasons are a storytelling shamble. Solid acting, good production, exotic NZ make it enjoyable enough.",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2021,lucy_kearn,10," The whole package
","I really enjoyed this series - I've binged the first two seasons, and eager for the third. Jack Irish manages to pack in everything that makes for great viewing: fantastic locations (I love Fitzroy, but also really enjoy the overseas locations), a treasure chest of wonderful Australian actors, intriguing plots and plenty of witty humor.",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2019,the_nephilim71,3," Boring
",I really wanted to like it but it was so boring it almost put me to sleep after only 20 minutes.,/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2021,pilot1009,2," Slapstick mixed with weird detective
","Quite funny in places though I'm not sure it was supposed to be, story is nonsense mixed with offbeat Aussie stereotypes and is not at all real. As it progresses very slowly the whole becomes quite irritating.",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2021,sheepshearer,7," Good, but not as good as season 1/2
","I really enjoyed season 3, but it was the weakest of the seasons so far.",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2021,Danamarshall70,9," The flaws are the beauty
",People are flawed. That is what makes this show great.,/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2020,siobhanmccormack,7," One for the Antipodeans
",Very low key..and more than a bit hammy...but so nice to watch something relatable on Netflix..as a NZer or Australian..you love the European Crime..but sometimes its nice to watch something a whole lot less slick.,/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2017,maggiemassey,8," Wish Jack Irish were real
","Jack and his friends are up to no good again. The last woman in his life is off to follow a story in the Phillipines, Jack is alone again and trouble always finds Jack. If it is no his horse friends, then it's his legal friends, if not them then it is the woman or women in his life ,and that usually means Jack is in for pain and broken bones.Then there are always his friends at the pub to help him find the answers and hide him from those that want to kill him or through him in jail. This season is more painful then the others because there is a bigger cross over story then before. From the jungles of the Phillipines and the story being covered there the murders and mysteries of where is "" Tina"" and ""who and why people are being killed"" Also who took Jacks money after putting it into his account. Will Jack ever find the answers before he is killed himself?",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2021,nbrice18,3," Not as Good as I Hoped
","I've watched a lot of Australian shows and been a fan of many: City Homicide, Blue Heelers (the first few seasons), Water Rats, Killing Time (outstanding), Mystery Road, Young Lions....but this show is disappointing. I wasn't familiar with any of the cast except Damien Richardson and Aaron Pederson. Guy Pearce is Australia's Billy Bob Thornton; skinny, scruffy and drunk. The women are annoying. I can't believe that there's a female scuptor who does ugly metal pieces (rip off from The Alice). The anti-Christian plot is ridiculous. Thankfully there aren't a lot of episodes.",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2019,glamm-87420,5," You hate it when you're smarter than the characters..
",It's just painful to watch the characters painstakingly come to conclusions you saw coming ages ago. The connect dots like we hadn't put it all together in the first episode. Characters don't even seem to know what they're doing while they're doing it. Linda thinks she's chasing a completely different story for the majority of the series. Everything just happens to her. Lazy writing.,/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2021,andrewdobbo,8," Loved this series and the movies, however Series 3 drops off and a lot darker.
","Really enjoyed the movies and first two series of this excellent show. The third and final series is a lot darker and a little disappointing with the an old familiar story line of corrupt cops and a heartless racing industry. Never the less, it is well written, directed and with a fine cast. All in all an excellent series well worth a watch.",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2017,aphillips-43057,2," As a Detective, Jack Irish Is a Loser
","This series disappointed my wife and me. There were some fine supporting players, but Jack Irish was a loser as far as being the lead detective. He seemed to never have a plan and much of what he did was stupid. He always looked as though he had just been beat up and hadn't changed his clothes in a week. The two girlfriends he had in the series were clearly above his level. It's definitely way below average.",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2021,westsideschl,5," Went? Nowhere! - Season 3
","Really nothing I will remember in a week. The usual money missing from an undercover police drug bust. Cops being revenged killed by the son of someone convicted. Does Jack pull his life together & resolve his wife's killing? Lots of quick resolutions in four quick, lots of talking, episodes.",/review/rw7675424/?ref_=tt_urv
