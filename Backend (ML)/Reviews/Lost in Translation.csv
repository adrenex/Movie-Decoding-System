20 May 2015,evanston_dad,8," Into the Wild with Reese Witherspoon
","A wonderful performance from Reese Witherspoon anchors this very good film about a troubled young woman who embarks on a miles-long hike as a sort of personal therapy to deal with the downward spiral of her life in the wake of her mother's (Laura Dern) death. Witherspoon reminds everyone what a good actress she is; I haven't been this impressed by her as an actress since ""Election"" way back in 1999 (and that includes her overrated Oscar-winning performance in ""Walk the Line""). And it's nice to see Laura Dern again, who's popped up here and there over the past many years but has mostly been absent from the movie scene. The movie's editor deftly integrates flashbacks of Dern and Witherspoon together with the character's hike through the wild, and avoids the monotony that usually plagues films when structured this way.",/review/rw3156203/?ref_=tt_urv

20 May 2015,Garcwrites,7," A little gem of a movie about goals and personal growth
","Wild has a really intriguing premise, the idea of a solo hike does it for me but I was wary that the movie lasted over 100min. What could possibly be entertaining about a women hiking alone from the Mexican border to the Canadian Border? As it turns out quite a lot.",/review/rw3156203/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2020,Tweekums,8," The inspiring story of one woman's long walk
","This film tells the story of Cheryl Strayed, a woman who walked 1100 miles along the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) from the Mexican border in the south to the Columbia River on the border between Oregon and Washingtin in the north despite having no hiking experience. Interspersed with scenes of her journey we see, via flashbacks, how her life fell apart following the death of her mother and the collapse of her marriage leading to behaviour that was probably as dangerous as hiking the PCT without being properly prepared.",/review/rw3156203/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2019,tabuno,9," Almost Perfect Immersion Into Life
","10 January 2015. Some people would compare Wild to Sean Penn's Into The Wild (2007) where a 24-year old student sells off his possessions and then hitchhikes to Alaska to live in the wilderness. Instead a closer comparative movies might be Kevin McDonald's Touching The Void (2003) about two climbers who brave the Andes Mountains or Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation (2003) about an American television star who is hired to perform in a commercial in Japan. While Sean Penn directs a movie which in replete with fantastic and mesmerizing photography along with the performance by Emile Hirsh where both background and foreground seem to compete for attention, Sean-Mark Vallee has created a backdrop that enhances the performance of Reese Witherspoon on her 1,000 mile hike on the Pacific Crest Trail.",/review/rw3156203/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2015,regalosdelsol,7," I Don't Care What They Say...I Really Liked This Movie!
","I am really surprised at all of the negative reviews here. But then I remember, this is IMDb. Enough said there. I enjoyed this movie very much. I don't think it was anything more than the story of one woman trying to find a way to move forward. This movie is not a political statement about feminism. This is ONE woman's story of regret, healing, and ultimately about forgiving herself so that she could move forward. Is this movie boring? Only if you need CGI and superheroes to call it ""exciting."" Do people do really adventurous things like taking off alone on a thousand mile trek on foot? Yeah, they do. And most of them actually survive. People have been surviving for thousands of years by striking out on their own without any previous experience or ""training."" Many years ago I did something very similar to what this woman did in the Sierra Nevadas. Looking back now I know I must have been crazy to do something so unplanned. But it was something I felt I had to do and was also stemmed from a tragic loss. I thought Reese was very believable in this role. The constant flashbacks that seemed to bother all the other reviewers did not bother me in the least. The flashbacks were the unfolding of her life taken in little pieces and in sync with the memories that were ignited within her on her journey. So contrary to the other reviewers, I liked this movie! The soundtrack was right on target with what was happening in each scene. The scenery was stunning, but of course it would be if you've ever been in the area. On foot. I happily gave this movie a rating of 7 out of 10.",/review/rw3156203/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's 1995. Cheryl Strayed (Reese Witherspoon) hikes the Pacific Crest Trail. She's a novice with an overweight pack and undersized boots. As she hikes, she's dealing with her personal demons and troubled past. Her father was a violent drunk. Her mother (Laura Dern) raised her and her brother after leaving him. Cheryl is shattered when she dies. She became a drug addict and detached. Her marriage to Paul (Thomas Sadoski) ended but he continues to be supportive.",/review/rw3156203/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2015,billygoat1071,9," A Rewarding Struggle
","Wild is based on the memoir of Cheryl Strayed about her lone hike on the Pacific Crest Trail. This journey is meant to be an escape from her personal problems and possibly rehabilitating herself from a troubling past. It expresses these feelings thoroughly; at every turn, there has to be a reminder of what she's been through, but also deals with a potential danger in this hike. The movie lives up to its sentiment, the pain and obstacles that the story goes through feel genuine and it leaves us such a rewarding experience. There are some parts that can feel a little uneven, but its spirit stays intact, enduring what the movie is meant to be.",/review/rw3156203/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2015,caseyyau,10," The long and winding road
","I am the daughter of a mother who recently passed away from lung cancer. She never smoked, like the protagonist mother. I cried many times during this movie. It made me think a lot because like the lead character, i often ruminate over the past; i have a lot of flashbacks and memories of my mother keep replaying in my head., and the things she said to me will forever echo in my brain. In terms of the sex and the drug taking, i think Resse did very well in portraying the daughter who completely lost herself and the desire to live with the loss of her mother. I also grew up in a single household and my mother and I were always together, our identity are intertwined; it was us against the world. Losing our mother is like losing more than life itself, I am still finding myself lost and struggling to find meaning in life. It is a constant struggle to not give up and give into self destruction and I am very thankful that the protagonist captured this feeling very well.",/review/rw3156203/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2015,Red_Identity,," Immensely moving
","No secret that I love one-man survival films (although this wasn't that type of ""survival"" film). Still, despite very good reviews, there was always a severe lack of hype and passion it seemed (certainly here). Maybe that's why I was so surprised. Usually this kind of heavy-edited, heavy- flashback-intercutting-with-main-story film alienates me emotionally for that reason. Too much back and forth. I had the same problem with 2007's Into The Wild, which so often prevented me from getting too involved with it. For some reason I didn't have that problem here. The actual story, as well as the dramatic ticks in the flashbacks and even in the present, aren't anything we haven't seen before dozens of times. However, the film really managed work despite that. The editing I found to enhance the film immensely, and the specific style of the intercutting with her memories managed to make the film more powerful. ",/review/rw3156203/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2015,deloudelouvain,8," Nice movie about pushing yourself a bit further.
","I don't get why there are so much negative reviewers for this movie. I wonder what kind of movie they really like? Probably boring stuff from Lynch or Von Trier... I really like Wild, because it's a good story well played by Reese Witherspoon. It's about a woman pushing her boundaries a little bit more every day to forget about some things that have gone bad in her life. She is alone on her journey and has time enough to think about her life, her decisions she made, about the good and bad souvenirs of her past. The nature shots are certainly making this movie worth a watch. After watching this movie it made me want to hike myself. To push yourself a little bit further then your are used to...",/review/rw3156203/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2015,paintedsolace,9," What is wrong with the world !!
","This was a great movie and exactly what I needed! I know from now on to not listen to most of the reviews on here at all. They are the opposite of good!? This was along the lines of Into The Wild, not as good but not bad at all and worth watching. Well done! This could be called a chick flick for real women who want substance, Strength and encouragement from the female in the role. When the world gets to much and is sucking your life away- Get the heck out and walk, climb a mountain , ride a horse ! Push the boundaries of what you think you are capable of and learn! I cried , it was good. I didn't know anything about it until I watched it. I have been coming to IMDb to pick movies with good ratings and people giving good reviews. Only to be disappointed time and again. If you like the Idea of the film , you will likely enjoy it as much as I did.",/review/rw3156203/?ref_=tt_urv

","In 2016 after my divorce I decided to complete a 1000 km (620 mile) hike here in Western Australia, when I was in a dark place, very overweight and very unfit. I was looking for something to inspire me, show me courage, Wild played a big part in my starting and completing this great journey. I can relate to so much of this story. What else would you want a movie to do. I think that I watched it about 10 times prior to my end-to-end. The over packing of gear but more importantly the mind gear, because hiking like this is 90% mental. The performances by everyone were so natural, like they belonged there. Which is actually what you learn while hiking, everything has its place, no judgement.",/review/rw3156203/?ref_=tt_urv

","I like biographies and from this movie I glimpsed that probably the book it is based on was worth reading. The movie is very good as well, with Reese Witherspoon doing a good job portraying this woman who decides to hike 1100 miles in order to come to terms with her grief and put her life in order. However I have to give kudos to the director and screenwriters who managed to put this idea into a digestible movie. I would think it is very difficult.",/review/rw3156203/?ref_=tt_urv

1 October 2014,howard.schumann,8," An empowering transformation
","The poet Rilke said ""There is only one journey. Going inside yourself. Here something blooms; from out of a silent crevice, an unknowing weed emerges singing into existence."" That unknowing weed sings loud and clear in Jean Marc Vallée's (Dallas Buyer's Club) Wild, the story of 26-year-old Cheryl Strayed's 1,000 mile hike along the Pacific Crest Trail in 1995 in an attempt to redeem a troubled past. Unlike John Curran's Tracks which documented naturalist Robyn Davidson's grueling nine-month journey through the Australian outback, Wild is more of an inward-looking psychological drama than a physical adventure, but it has enough of both to keep us focused.",/review/rw3156203/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2014,trublu215,2," Wild is painfully boring and woefully misguided
","Wild tells the story of Cheryl, a drug fueled binge drinker who lost her mother and feels lost on the path to life so she decides to pick up and walk the Pacific coast trail. Directed by Jean Marc Valèe of last year's Dallas Buyers Club, I was going into this hoping for a brilliant film, instead I came away with great cinematography, an unbelievable Reese Witherspoon and misguided story that wants to be something more than ""a woman and the wilderness"" movie. Well, unfortunately, its not. Valèe seems to have exhausted his talents into last year's Dallas Buyers Club rather than into Wild. My problems with this film exude my likes, obviously but one thing about this film that I can't seem to shake is Witherspoon. I don't buy her as this character, she can't pass as a woman who is a drinker and a drug abuser because quite frankly, she looks terrible on screen doing these things. I don't buy it for a second, it is like watching a student film rehash of a better performance and cringing at how bad the student screws it up. The role of Cheryl was clearly meant for someone with a better range than Witherspoon. I'm all for an actor to transform themselves to fit a film, much like McCounaghey did for Dallas Buyers. But Witherspoon seems so hesitant to do anything other than gain five pounds and not wear make-up for the entire film. No, it doesn't make it look like she has a drug and alcohol problem or is conflicted or is realistic, it just makes for a lazy performance and it is one I couldn't commit to for a two hour film. As far as the screenplay is concerned...well, what screenplay, it is mostly Reese Witherspoon trekking across the Pacific trail while reminiscing about past times and discovering dead end relationships along the way. It is a bare bones script from a bare bones book that was equally disappointing. However, the film may be boring and painfully slow, but the cinematography here was fantastic. There are some truly beautiful moments in this film regarding the way it looks. Outside Witherspoon, the supporting cast features Gabby Hoffman and Laura Dern and both of which deliver good performances. Overall, Wild features some great cinematography and a truly shoddy performance from Witherspoon. I can't begin to explain why she is being praised for taking off make up and walking on a trail for a two hour film. It isn't a brave performance, its a lazy one and an even lazier film. Wild is far from Sean Penn's Into the Wild, which I'm sure will be the base of comparison and feels more like a half baked version of it.",/review/rw3156203/?ref_=tt_urv

","An arduous journey across America on the Pacific Crest Trail, Cheryl Strayed tests her tenacity to continue forward till the end. There's very little else to the story, which makes this film really powerful. With not much else other than a tedious walk and a vampish past the story bobs back and forth between the present and the past revealing how Cheryl finds herself in such a circumstance and why she cant stop until she is finished.

","Wild fails as a movie for several reasons. A movie based on a book should motivate the movie-goer to turn to the written word for more details. The impression I received from seeing wild is that the book is a self-serving portrayal of a self-destructive personality and some sort of redemption through a self-destructive hike. I suspect that the book uses the personal pronoun singular far too often. If the hike is the path to redemption, when did it occur and why? Damned if I know. We're told at the end that Cheryl ultimately has a happy life and take that on faith because the movie doesn't provide a clue.",/review/rw3156203/?ref_=tt_urv
