22 January 2023,WubbaLubbaDubDub,6," I almost turned it off, stick around for the second half!
","This movie starts off messy. The story, acting, characters, felt so poorly created as a horror fan I couldn't see its value. But after we get comfortable in the morgue and the chase is on it picks up. By the end it had my full attention. I really thought they messed up with the lead actress initially but now I get why she was hired. Young lady can scream and showed excellent range in the second half. Displayed great rage. Not just the damsel I thought it was setting her up for. I could see her growing as a scream queen. Hope to see her in more films. Part of why I wanted to stick things out was Jerry O' Connell and he's a great villian in this. I've seen him pop up in a few horrors before and he always entertains. I grew up with his films so I may have a bias admittedly. By the end they do an excellent job at creating a monster. I could see a sequel happen with his character. I'm not a big gore fan, it's not too excessive but body parts are involed so don't be too caught off guard. There's not a lot of bad language. Because I'd read the negative reviews I thought it was worth sharing a positive experience. First half I was going to give it a 4, enjoyed the second so much it earned two points.",/review/rw8850930/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,sos_poseidon,6," Implausible But Engaging
","Even with the 100% implausible plot and situations, it actually held my attention until the very end. There are scenes that are nicely done and the suspense is through the roof. There are other scenes that you simply have to suspend all disbelief and just be entertained. The final battle between the heroine and the maniac coroner ends in a very well done makeup effect that is both gruesome and also a lesson in anatomy. Although I wasn't familiar with the lead actress, she did well in the role. Most will recognize the evil coroner, Jerry O'Connell, from television and other movies. His deadpan delivery and reserved portrayal was effective.",/review/rw8850930/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,nogodnomasters,5," You'll shoot your eye out
","Chloe Albright (Bailee Madison) is left a house by her deceased father who had zero insurance. She is a student with debts the bank demands and threatens to take the house. Her brother TJ (Anthony Turpel) and her former boyfriend Ross (Chris Lee) have a plan. They are going to rob a house owned by a man who believes in the Second Amendment. Ross is shot at the scene and pronounced dead while TJ gets away. TJ makes it back home, but they figure out Ross has a cell phone that they used to plan the crime. They must get it back. In order to get it back, Chloe takes some drugs to simulate death so she can have access to the morgue. Turns out Ross isn't dead yet, and that is bad news for Chloe as the Coroner (Jerry O'Connell) has his own retirement plan.",/review/rw8850930/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,zack_gideon,6," Solid low budget effort
","For the budget and premise this movie actually is pretty entertaining. Granted there are some pretty bad plot holes around character decisions and a few other things, but I found myself engaged( mostly from the increasing tension and acting.",/review/rw8850930/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,Boristhemoggy,5," Another solid B movie
","Bailee Madison isn't my jam at all, but I gave this film a chance and it wasn't too shabby.",/review/rw8850930/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2023,Luv2Spooge,4," Average... just average
","It started out quite well, but then quickly turned into a cliche. There's absolutely nothing surprising or noteworthy, you can pretty much figure out the whole plot and even the twists within the first few minutes of the film.",/review/rw8850930/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,SolaceSolitude,6," A fun thriller.
","If you could get past the plot holes similar to a Swiss cheese, how a girl of her tiny size with no training at all except being a first or second year medical student in a field could defeat a grown serial killer and a trained huge cop who happens to be incompetent with a sadistic mind while saving her brother from an organ trafficking ring, a German shepherd dog and finally the awful movies that have been on for the past decade then it's a fairly okay thriller.",/review/rw8850930/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2023,psxexperten,1," Absolute garbage, stay away at all cost.
","Starts Off Bad, But Wait, it Gets Worse...
Another worst film!",/review/rw8850930/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2023,Vivekmaru45,5," From The Director Of Dracula 2000, comes a brand new offering.
","But sorry to say, it has come far too late in this era of over-saturated Hollywood horror movies.",/review/rw8850930/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,sarisled-05918,3," Not the best lead actress
",Thats why it gets a 3 and because some dialogue was so bad it made me cringe.,/review/rw8850930/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,ahnjaehee,1," One of the worst horror movies I've ever watched
","I was extremely excited when I heard about this movie online. But it just falls really REALLY flat. So spoilers ahead for those that still wanna watch. Girl poisons herself (calling it a fake overdose) to get into the morgue to get her brother's cell phone. Then crap hits the fan. The creepy coroner finds out she's there and starts to hunt her down. I just find the movie to be a waste of time and there to be plot holes. There's a scene where she does shoot him in the eye and he's bleeding,it looks like a bb pellet came out of the gun. Then the scene after it his eye is fine and not bloody at all. It's weird,I had to rewind it to make sure I saw it correctly. It just feels sloppy and rushed. If you're into gore just for the hell of it then yeah,this is your movie I guess. Warning about the end,the dog is seen eating a corpse.",/review/rw8850930/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,martinmatthewnovak,6," Watchable and Suspenseful
",Solid B movie. It kept me interested the whole time. Suspenseful and great thriller. Wonderful job by Jerry O' Connell. FYI it takes about 40 minutes before it gets really good. Good choice overall don't let the low budget comments fool you.,/review/rw8850930/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2023,jasmineayouby,7," This gave me anxiety!
","This movie is really INTENSE! Bailee Madison is AMAZING in this, for those who said otherwise I am surprised! I was impressed by her ability to make this SO believable that I felt her fear, my heart was racing and it had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. From the moment I saw the creepy coroner, I knew something was wrong and he is a great villain-very believable. Had I been in Chloe's shoes, I would've died! Definitely a good thriller, parts had me gasping and giving me anxiety lol",/review/rw8850930/?ref_=tt_urv
