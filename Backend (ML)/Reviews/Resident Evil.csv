16 January 2005,enkephalin07,8," Good survival horror
","I had to sift long and deep for a good comment on this. Why all the hostility? I think there was great chemistry on this production and it shows; the actors and crew involved loved the game and had a good time making this. This movie successfully recreated the feel of the game, and because it kept exposition to a minimum of what you needed to know for this particular story and didn't borrow from or revise any of the original characters or settings, it supported and strengthened the franchise. No story is retold here, no words are wasted, the setting, feel and pace is familiar to fans of Resident Evil and yet it's perfectly accessible to those unfamiliar with the broader storyline. Not giving the fan-boys their favorite characters was a good choice since characters tend to get mangled in adaptation, and yet the fan-boys still complain. With this film you have a good, watchable story that can partake of the Resident Evil cosmology, showing it due respect.",/review/rw6625892/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2020,MR-ODIN,," Resident Evil
","Exactly the right movie at exactly the right time. The music and atmosphere, the sets and costume design, the special effects, the cast. Everything lined up perfectly for a young shaggy. That kid was a gothy nerd with love for video-games, horror, industrial music and Mila Jovovich. This movie managed to check all the boxes. Watching it now, it still pretty much holds up. Maybe a little cheesy but stylish and entertaining. 6 stars for watchability, one for nostalgia.",/review/rw6625892/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2007,teslaman,9," Solid!!
",As a big fan of splatter and horror films i was gladly surprised when i watched this. I haven't played the game so i had no idea what to expect and had nothing to compare with. I really feel that this pays homage to the old zombie films at least to an extent. The zombies here are a little bit faster though.,/review/rw6625892/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2020,repojack,8," Don't listen to the critics -- great flick
","I originally watched ""Resident Evil"" at a movie theater when it was first released in 2002. I hadn't played the games. There was no Rotten Tomatoes and I didn't read reviews back then so I went in blind. And I utterly enjoyed the movie: the story, the action sequences, the underground ""Hive,"" Mila Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez kicking serious ass, and more.",/review/rw6625892/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2003,cherold,7," Finally, a video game adaption done right
","This movie means business. Quick disaster with a mystery to it, jarring deaths, naked Milla, all in the first few minutes. It keeps up the pace throughout. In terms of critical comments, yes, you don't really care about the characters, but so what? How often do you really care about the monster fodder in horror films? And true, it wasn't a literal working of the movie, it didn't take place in a mansion and it didn't involve exploring lots of rooms and solving puzzles. That's because it's a movie. A literal translation of Resident Evil would probably be really dull. Games and movies are very different mediums. I don't think some people here understand that. One guy said he thought the movie rocked but after repeated viewings he thought it sucked, and that's a video game player attitude - movies don't have to have good replay value, it's okay to enjoy them once. I only enjoyed Star Wars once, but I don't think it sucked, it just didn't have a lot of depth. Not every movie has to be Citizen Kane. ",/review/rw6625892/?ref_=tt_urv

","First things first, I really like ""Resident Evil"". While I can't comment on the success of the conversion to a movie as I've never played any of the numerous video games, the film is beautifully shot and has an urgent pace. It also has a great looking cast, a thumping soundtrack and plenty of boys' toys.",/review/rw6625892/?ref_=tt_urv

","In the near future, the powerful Umbrella Corporation has a hidden research facility called The Hive underneath Raccoon City, where the scientists develop genetically engineered drugs for medical purpose and biological weapons. After stealing the lethal T-virus, a thief contaminates The Hive and the artificial intelligence Red Queen seals the Hive and kills all the staff and guinea pigs. A woman called Alice (Milla Jovovich) awakes naked in a bathroom of a mansion without memory and soon a commando led by a man called One (Colin Salmon) subdues her and another man called Matt (Eric Mabius), who claims to be a cop. Alice learns that she is a security guard with her partner Spence (James Purefoy) assigned to protect the entrance to The Hive and her memory will return in an undefined period since she was affected by a gas. The Red Queen had a malfunctioning five hours ago and had shut down the facility and killed everybody releasing a lethal gas. Now they need to shut down the Red Queen and restart her systems. They use an underground train to reach The Hive and the Red Queen asks then to leave the place. However Kaplan (Martin Crewes) disables the Red Queen opening the doors in The Hive. Soon the group learns that the staff has turned into zombies and now they are under siege of the zombies. Most of the commando dies and only Alice, Spence, Matt, Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) and Kaplan survive. Now they need to find a way to escape from The Hive since the system will shut down the exits in a short period. Who will survive?",/review/rw6625892/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2008,Dragoneyed363,9," Non-stop fun and unimaginable good, bloody action
","Resident Evil is probably my favorite zombie movie next to Planet Terror. It had flaws, some acting was poor, but still was one great time from start to finish and excellently crafted entertainment!!!!! It had wonderful action, nice gore and the performances overall were exceedingly decent for what they needed to be for a video game adaptation. I especially love Michelle Rodriguez's portrayal of Pain; amazing character. ",/review/rw6625892/?ref_=tt_urv

","All the talk of no females in movies but you have these and underworlds. Critics just slam them though rather then enjoy for what they are, ridiculous action/horror movies .

","Recently I saw the theatrical trailer for Resident Evil: Extinction and it occurred to me, I have never seen the first two Resident Evil films, and I always wanted to see them. So I rented the first two Resident Evil films and watched them last night. I had a lot of fun watching Resident Evil, it was very high action and kept my heart racing on what would happen next. This is a great movie based on a video game, this is the kind of movie that we need if we are talking about basing it on a video game. I haven't seen a good one since Mortal Kombat. The action and effects were so awesome not to mention that there are some very awesome scares in here. Very cool make up for the zombies; and the story was excellent.",/review/rw6625892/?ref_=tt_urv

","I enjoyed this movie. I don't know about the sequels yet but this one was fun to watch. Casting and acting was okay except the main leading actress. Plot was simple but shown in effective way. Horror element was also good, there are some jump elements also. What I liked about the movie was that it didn't show everything straight, it tried to create suspense.",/review/rw6625892/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2017,Fella_shibby,9," High octane zombi flick with an amazing laser defence system scene n ferocious dogs.
","I saw this first in a theatre in 2002. It is a fast-paced, high octane zombie flick filled with brisk action sequences. Revisited it recently on a DVD. Seen all its sequels in theatre. The plot - A virus has been released inside a secret underground lab, turning its workers into zombies, a military task force is deployed to take care of the problem. The lab is filled with traps n packed with flesh-eating creatures n ferocious dogs. The film actually does an efficient job of recreating the ambiance of the video game. The initial office building chaos is great and there's a bit of nastiness involving an elevator scene. The film is famous for its laser defence system scene, the zombified dogs, awesome fight scene with the zombie doberman dogs n different creatures. It is also an adventure film in which the lead characters, especially Milla Jovovich always move forward without looking back. Another known face, Michelle Rodriguez is at her sexiest when wielding a weapon. Paul W.S. Anderson famous for action/horror/sci-fi films did a fine job with the direction.",/review/rw6625892/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2015,Tweekums,7," Solid enough zombie movie based on a video game
","As the film opens we that the film is set in a near future where the Umbrella Corporation is the world's largest business and that some of its activities are distinctly shady. The action then starts in a lab where an unknown thief steals a case containing a biological weapon that we later learn is called the T-Virus. As he fleas he smashes one of the vials releasing the virus into the facility, known as The Hive. As the virus is spread through the air-conditioning The Hive's computer seals the facility and kills everybody inside. We then cut to the sight of a naked woman, Alice, wrapped in a shower curtain; she gets dressed and is surprised first by an unknown man then by a whole squad of commandos! Their leader addresses her as 'Soldier' but she has no idea who she is. The other man identifies himself as a newly transferred police officer. These two are then taken by an underground railway to The Hive where we learn they intend to shut down the computer, known as Red Queen. Red Queen's defences kill many of the commandos and before the others shut it down its avatar informs them that they will all die. It soon becomes apparent that the people in The Hive have come back to life as zombies! Perhaps Red Queen was right; certainly many of them won't make it; some of them will become zombies themselves and not all of the dangers are outside the group.",/review/rw6625892/?ref_=tt_urv

","Way too underrated movie! As a kid I remember this was scary as hell and even today 2021 it holds up pretty well. Milla is hot and so bad ass slaying those zombies!

17 August 2017,Richie-67-485852,9," At Home in this Residence
","I remember the first time I caught this it was by accident (?) The opening sequence where they explain an underground facility intrigued me so I stayed with it. It pulled me right in. The story is rather unique and they pull it off in a credible way. Who doesn't like a secret underground city type facility, run by a computer that has had a breakdown of some sort being investigated by an elite squad of Marine types? It just captures you as the story unravels quite nicely. It had some nice scares and twists and just when you think you are out it pulls you back in more than once I might add. Its just a well executed movie. While I prefer no nudity in the movies, this was understandable as the story presents it. It does distract but for Hollywood that means $$$. This went on to launch a series of movies so need for me to go on and on. Give a look-see and find out what this is all about. BTW...I like to eat while watching. However, Zombie films don't stimulate the appetite and this had plenty of thrill-action keeping you occupied. Do have a tasty drink and perhaps some sunflower seeds on standby.

27 July 2019,mrosesteed,7," Fun action-horror
","The first in a decade-and-a-half-long film series inspired by the 1996 Capcom video game of the same name, Resident Evil transforms its source material from gothic survival horror to modern action-horror, complete with prominent electronic music, stock action characters, and CGI violence. Although the movie's uninspired shock sounds, dated computer graphics, choppy flashbacks, and stereotypical casting foreshadow the weaknesses of its vastly inferior sequels, Resident Evil benefits from a solid mystery plot, detailed art direction, and a charismatic performance by Milla Jovovich as a mordern, grown up Alice in Wonderland. The result is a fun thriller whose lack of graphic violence does not dampen the horror of the Umbrella Corporation's cavalier attitude toward human life.",/review/rw6625892/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2021,jdring2007,9," Violent fun, often mindless even in direction, but stylish without the silly flair of future installments, and enjoyable
","I'll start off by saying that, while I am very familiar with the video game series, I'm no diehard fan. That said, I do recognize the sort of ""treason"" in play, making a movie adaptation and featuring not a single character from the games. Instead they go with a fabricated character, Alice, and from the second movie spawn this whole clone-with-magic-powers story arc. Before all of that, however, was this - ground zero. There are still homages to the first 2 games, some more obvious than others, but as a straightforward zombie action flick, it satisfies. Plus, I gotta say, especially as a teenager when I first ""fell in love with"" this flick, the characters - cliche and averagely acted as they are - each have very entertaining moments. Michelle Rodriguez and James Purefoy were favorites, although I've come to love Milla Jovovich too, who in this installment exercises her versatility in playing a helpless civilian to a major badass, all without being too over the top as the sequels were. Plus the ""evolving"" Licker, a great enemy from the games, was incorporated very well in my opinion, teasing it throughout until its final revelation, a delightful mix of practical effects and CGI. No, thisovie is far from the ideal video game adaptation, but hey, it was fun for me as an action flick with some charisma.",/review/rw6625892/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Umbrella Corporation is a top secret company operating from a massive underground facility known as The Hive. After a deadly virus is released into the air, resulting in the deaths of all who work there, an elite squad of soldiers is sent in to shut down The Hive before the virus has a chance to escape into general population of the city above. It's here that they come across Alice (Mila Jovovich) who has no memory of who or where she is. As they continue down into The Hive, Alice starts to regain her memory bit by bit, but they all soon discover that shutting down the The Hive is the least of their worries when they learn that the human population have returned to life as vicious zombies.",/review/rw6625892/?ref_=tt_urv

","One day I sat and thought it could be nice re-watching some of the horror franchises real proper like, and all six ""Resident Evil"" installments happen to be somewhere far back in the viewing history. Having played a couple parts a little, I'm not well-versed in the gaming lore of ""Resident Evil"", so I won't talk much about those angles. Can't say I was a big fan of the films back then, but let's see the perception now. As the unforgettable Marilyn Manson's theme instrumental sets in, I'm cozy and ready.
Very quickly we get introduced to world's largest commercial entity, the Umbrella Corporation, their huge secret lab dubbed ""The Hive"", laying under Raccoon City, and the genetic experiments they carry on down there, as well as the T-virus. A yet unknown figure sabotages the operation and releases the virus, causing a rogue AI to shut off the hive and trap everyone inside. A special military unit gets sent in, on the way picking Milla Jovovich with a pretty bad memory lass. She is none other than Alice, as she'll reaffirm that to us for the rest of the franchise.",/review/rw6625892/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2021,paulclaassen,7," An impressive take on the zombie genre.
","'Resident Evil' is very different to most zombie films out there. The film revolves around a very powerful company, the Umbrella Corporation, which - unbeknownst to most of their employees - also designs and manufactures warfare weapons. The Hive is an impressively designed underground mega structure which houses over 500 scientists. We soon learn the company is being sabotaged, and it is this very sabotage that would ultimately lead to devastating consequences, as we discover in later installments in the franchise. Spence (James Purefoy) is the man responsible for this sabotage.",/review/rw6625892/?ref_=tt_urv
