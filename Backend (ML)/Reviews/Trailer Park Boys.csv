17 April 2007,ametaphysicalshark,," An inconvenient truth
","One of the most common criticisms of ""Thirteen"" is that it is 'unrealistic'. However, ""Thirteen"" never claims to portray all thirteen year olds, hell, it doesn't even claim to portray a significant number of them. This film is about the select few who choose to take a certain path in life. They have no true parental figures, their lives are in shambles, and they are making a quick and painful transition into supposed adulthood. Notice the other people in the school scenes, they're normal, they're just studying, hanging out with their friends, and going through the motions of school life. Those aren't the people that are being portrayed here.",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2018,lorcan-61881,10," Sad, dark and overall true to EVERYTHING
","Thirteen is a 2003 drama that stars Holly Hunter and follows her coping as a mother to maintain the new and disrespectful personality of her daughter after entering into the wrong friend zone, filled with sex, petty crime and drugs. Thirteen sounded like a enjoyable watch at the time and when i finally watched my DVD, I was slowly more and more hooked to the reality on the screen, although, me being a teenager, knows that the style in this movie as CRINGY AS HELL, this film is so true and has happened before and is still happening all over the world, kids have a dream to be someone they don't even know themselves so they can be accepted in life only to be let down more then they already were, I have actually seen it before and experienced it a couple of times myself, the acting, dialogue and pace is so well done and actors like Holly Hunter, Jeremy Sisto and Nikki Reed totally steal the sha. It's just so painful and shocking to think that a sweet girl like the main girl in the film can actually change that much into a disrespectful, punk, foul mouth attituded teenager. Thirteen is a very educational film for parents who think they're children are acting like they never did before. 10/10! ",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2014,trixie-k-88,10," Excellent film and realistic depiction of troubled teenage girls
","I have loved this movie since it came out in 2003. It is well written, well, acted, and is realistic about subjects most people ignore.",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2004,bob the moo,," Occasionally goes to extremes but is very convincing with great characters in the hands of three actresses all giving great performances
","Tracy is a normal thirteen-year-old girl, dressed in bright pastels, bedroom full of soft toys and with giggly thoughts of boys. Starting school in the new term she finds everyone in awe of Evie Zamora and her friends Â– all of who have suddenly turned into sexy young ladies over the summer. With her goofy kid look, Evie blanks Tracy until she impresses her by stealing a purse to go shopping. As Evie gets in with Tracy's mum Mel, she also takes Evie into her own world of rebellion involving stealing, drink, disobedience, drugs and sex. Mel struggles to hold on to the small parts of her daughter that she still recognises.",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2004,Freedomisanillusion,10," Proof that the oscars are rigged...
","How did Holly Hunter not win that Oscar? Why weren't Evan Rachel Wood and Nikki Reed at least nominated, let alone winners?",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2021,karin-mozina,10," Realistic, even if you don't want to believe it
","I'd recommend watching this move for the last big scene alone. One of the best movie scenes I've ever seen.
It might be that I also can identify with a lot of the issues, watching at the 13 year old self. Very well executed.",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2004,DJExcen,10," Scary, Beautiful, Gritty Picture of Adolescence
","Wow.  Talk about a train wreck.  Of course I'm speaking in reference to the life of Tracy, the main character, not the movie itself.  I give props to the cast and crew, they all got mad skillz.  Now for a more intellectual look toward the dystopic view of adolescence and the loss of innocence.",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2022,cristinasimmer,10," Call me Biased for the Nostalgia, but it's a 10/10 for me
","When I was younger, I'd always scout for movies like Triple Dog or Thirteen when I was 12 and bored on Netflix. I'm now 18 and this movie gives me those same nostalgic feelings I got when I watched those. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and really gives those 2003 feels. I truly enjoy the story and the exciting adventures the teens go on. It's such an interesting experience to go on with them and I suggest watching this movie.",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2014,SnoopyStyle,7," More than just an afterschool special
","Tracy Freeland (Evan Rachel Wood) is a smart, sweet, conscientious 13 year old. She lives with her single recovering addict mom Melanie (Holly Hunter). She befriends popular Evie Zamora (Nikki Reed) who leads down a road of stealing, skipping school, drugs, disobedience, and sex. Her mom struggles to stay in her life but she pulls away in anger. She doesn't like her mother's boyfriend Brady (Jeremy Sisto) either. Evie's home life is even more unstable living with her cousin Brooke (Deborah Kara Unger).",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2013,hawktwo,9," This was so true to life, except real life wasn't as optimistic
","In real life, I watched as 3 beautiful girls turned into these awful adolescents in real life. It was horrifying to see some of their own escapades on the screen. The heartbreak was real and Holly Hunter had it spot on. The reality of living with an out of control teen is so realistically shown. You give up your own life to try to desperately help someone you love with all your heart. Tough Love doesn't work when someone doesn't care.",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2019,j-a-julian,9," Great Movie .... underrated
","I thought this was a wonderful movie, gripping, intense and totally realistic. Those who think that some young teens don't encounter these issues, especially in broken homes, are belying reality. World class performances by the two young protagonists and Tracy's mom. The sound track, particularly the original pieces, is well done. The movie would have been harder hitting if the director had been a bit more graphic in the sexual situations, not pornographic, but just a bit more honest as to what happens in everyday life. Well worth watching. Under appreciated.",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2008,neil-476,6," A puzzle
","I don't want to miss the point of this film. I know the point of it is the pressures on today's adolescents, and their reactions to some of those pressures, and the effects on families in those circumstances. And if you're going to illustrate those points then you have to show cause and effect, and that means unpleasantness, and shouting matches, and drugs, and manipulation, and under-age sex and so on. You have to have those things in the movie, I get it.",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2014,Conor97,10," One of my all-time favourites!!
","I have seen this movie countless times and every time I watch it I pick up on a different thing each time, it's so great! Every single actor in this film is amazing, especially Evan Rachel Wood and Holly Hunter, their performances are outstanding. The film brings light to various issues that many teenagers go through and EVERYONE can relate to this. I'm a 17 year old boy and so many of the issues in the film are familiar to me: drugs, sex, eating disorders etc. I've watched some of my friends go through a lot of the things that happen in the film and I myself have had to deal with peer pressure (obviously) and have been curious about alcohol. There's a character that all different types of people can relate to: the single mother, the traumatised teenager, the abused girl, and so many others. What's great about this film is that it's so raw and although a lot of people disagree and say that the film is unrealistic, it's actually one of the most realistic films I've ever watched. Sure, not all teenagers go to the lengths that Tracy and Evie go to but we all crave attention and experiment, whether it be alcohol, drugs, or sex. And I unfortunately know many people who have self-harmed, just like Tracy. This film should be shown in high schools or a parent should watch it with their child and then have a talk with them afterwards. This film can educate teenagers and give them a tough lesson, showing, through the eyes of Tracy, what can go wrong when teenagers go out of control. It will teach them that it's not a good thing to do drugs or self-harm: Tracy is a prime example of why not to do these things. If anyone thinks that this film is unrealistic well then they must be living in a cave because this is one of the most realistic, gritty, raw, and emotional films that you will ever watch. ""How else can I say it? I don't speak no other languages."" Enjoy!",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2021,kosmasp,10," Life of a Teenage Girl
","I understand if you don't like it - because this movie could almost be seen as a mirror to society ... to reality ... to what Teenage Girl may go through (and certain aspects of it I'd argue all of them went through, especially at the time the movie was playing). So just because this ain't your cup of tea, believe me when I tell you that especially the life at school ... how girls talk and behave amongst each other ... spot on. I know because of my niece and what she told me .. things I did not think or imagined she had to go through.",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2022,joriethomas,10," Glad if you think this is not realistic
",One of my favorite indies. This was me at 13 and I'm the same age as Evan. Great movie that needs to be seen by parents. The coming of age story people don't want to see but is all too real. Brilliant script and acting.,/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2004,johnnymonsarrat,4," Jon Monsarrat review: Interesting premise, goes nowhere
",Thirteen starts with an interesting premise but unfortunately the story contains no plot twists or interesting turns. I haven't seen a film this straightforward and heavily foreshadowed since Heavenly Creatures. There was no need to watch the ending.,/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2007,Seamus2829,10," Kids Gone Wild
","No, I'm not talking about some trashy rip off of an even trashier series that has been making the rounds on home video, but another film in the series of young people gone berserk. Why,might you ask (and you should),lack of parental supervision,peer pressure (""but everybody's doing it,Mom""),you choose. There have been films dealing with the subject of adolescents gone over the top, some good, some bad. The good include films like 'Over The Edge'(1978),which gave a young Matt Dillon his start in films, 'Kids',which although a difficult film to watch,was worth squirming over just to see what young folk have become (for the above stated reasons). Thirteen is another addition to that good list. The film stars Evan Rachael Wood & Nikki Reed (who co-wrote the screen play,based on her own life experiences)about two girls who form a friendship (albiet near fatal,in this case),that delves into the usual peer pressure antics (shop lifting,drugs,sex,self destructive behavior,etc.). Despite the general ugliness of the proceedings,this film,and the others mentioned above are required viewing for parents of young adolescents & pre-adolescents",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2003,FeverDog,6," If this movie hadn't been written by a kid, it wouldn't be so praised.
","Enough already with ""it's too important to ignore."" Whoa, teens shoplift, make out, pierce their navels and hang out in the park at night! Whodathunk? Really, the only ""shocking"" moments are a scene or two of self-abuse, which failed to be properly integrated into the storyline. ",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2007,GOWBTW,10," I know that age very well!
","No longer a kid, not yet an adult. This movie explains it well. Being a teenager isn't all what it's cracked up to be. Peer-pressure, friends, sexual curiosity, etc. You got this girl named Tracy Freeland(Evan Rachel Wood) a common teenager who meets another named Evie Zamora(Nikki Reed), who happens to be the best friend from hell. She and Tracy are pretty tight, and Evie moves in with her and her brothers. She totally freaks out Tracy with her dance at her brothers and later flashed them. That's crazy. Everyone seems to be happy, until the dark side of Evie started to show. She steals, hangs around the wrong crowd, and her mother is doing what? Nothing! Tracy starts to follow the same path of destruction. Getting high, having sex, and worst of all Evie's starts making out with the mother's boyfriend. Her wild behavior is scaring Tracy's mother. So what's the best thing, get Tracy away from Evie. And Evie's mother starts taking action herself. This movie does provide so reassurances about the teenage life, they may falter once, but they can start over. 5 stars.",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2003,jdesando,," Be prepared for an unusual, unsettling, and unforgettable movie.
","If you are planning to have children, don't see this film.  It is so depressingly effective you might decide against children rather than attempt to deal with a 13-year-old daughter. So difficult is Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood), who is a former good girl under the influence of a worldly slut Evie (Nikki Reed, also co-writer), that she is painful to watch as she descends into the pit of drugs, sex, and adult bashing.",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2022,zac-04879,8," An Unpleasant, Realistic, Extremely Heavy and Outstanding Teen Drama
","Hardwicke's and Reed's mature teen drama, constructed from Reed's experience, is developed as an adolescent character analysis that ends up being highly distressing, poignantly gritty, extremely unpleasant and unbelievably intense. Thirteen admittedly looks exactly like your average teen/coming-of-age story to deal and send a message about drugs, theft, sex and peer pressure during adolescence, but surprisingly, it's not.",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv

10 June 2004,PIST-OFF,4," are drugs bad mommy?
","This movie is what would happen if a gap commericial and an after school special collided and went on forever and ever. Is this anything more than an excuse for new scare tactics on drugs? What exactly was the point of this movie. I'm sure it couldn't be the actresses fault, so I'm gonna stick to blaming the writer. The characters in the movie (both on and off drugs) seem so disjointed from reality or logic or common sense.....",/review/rw0888180/?ref_=tt_urv
