","That unique style of dialog tells you right away that this 34 minute animated treat is an ""existential"" short subject from the BBC, and quite mesmerizing. The first task of the reviewer is to categorize the film to assist potential viewers, but I am coming up blank. In my over 2000 reviews here, I have never encountered a single story that sets out to deliver so much ... and succeeds. It is an adventure, it is a drama, it is a fable, it is animation for kids, it is animation for adults, and it is also a morality tale. It is an unforgettable half hour. Recommended.

26 December 2022,goshamorrell,9," A Classic Book that needs more attention and Apple nailed the short film and the animation is phenomenal
","In a world that is often dark, Charlie Mackesy's words and illustrations of The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse, have served as moments of light. Beautiful in themselves, but more than that - they shine that light within ourselves to remember the good, the gentle, and the strength in kindness in our own lives and the world around us. The four much-loved characters stepped out of Charlie's imagination and into the world on Instagram, before finding a permanent home the best-selling book released in 2019. The TV adaptation, released on BBC One and iPlayer on Christmas Eve - and worldwide on Apple TV+ on Christmas Day - brings the friends to life. It's 35 minutes of exquisite, peaceful light, born to become a modern Christmas classic. ""I'm lost,"" says the Boy, voiced in heartbreaking gentleness by Jude Coward Nichol. Two words that will have resonated with many at some stage in this post-pandemic weary world. Charlie's drawings touched something within during those dark days of lockdown. Their kindness, humour and hope reached through the page, bringing comfort and connection. Simply put, it's beautiful, whether you enjoy Charlie's drawings and wisdoms as inspiration, comfort, self-reflection, or purely for their charm. It's as if you have stepped into the book itself. Hug your horses extra tight, be kind to yourself, and to quote the Mole, ""I'm glad we are all here"". While the book has no linear plot, the film needed one. And so Charlie's words and wisdoms have been woven into a script, taking the characters on a journey through a dream-like snowy landscape to find ""home"", set to a soundtrack by Isobel Waller-Bridge. And that messaging of kindness and gentleness translates gracefully from page to screen. Charlie collaborated with Jon Croker on the adaptation, and is also named as co-director alongside Peter Baynton. That involvement by the author is perhaps behind why the feel is just so close to the book.",/review/rw8755192/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2022,jromanbaker,10," The Number One Film
","When ' Sight and Sound ' put their list of one hundred films together this should have been in my humble opinion the Number One choice, nut then they probably had not had a preview of it. Maybe in ten years time it will reach that elevated height of critical acclaim, and we will all know why. A boy, a mole, a fox and a horse all journey together in the most beautiful animation I have ever seen. No spoilers but the journey is full of so called simple wisdom, and above all love even for our enemies. As it happens the fox is not the enemy we fear, but a being in our universal family of love. A film that lasts such a short time; such a short journey of time and yet it takes us so far. To a place that we should be and should strive to reach. The Number One of the future.",/review/rw8755192/?ref_=tt_urv

","Like many of you I bought the book a while book, captivated by the impressive art. The art and calligraphy is signature to the book.

","I was absolutely swept up by this beautifully told story and the innocence of its characters. I was anxiously awaiting the unfolding of the lovely, sensitive animation as it depicts this sweet boy's journey. His animal friends highlight his travels and are his steadfast allies and guardians as he tries to find his way home. I felt as if I were transported back to the wonder and innocence of my childhood as I watched this story unfold.",/review/rw8755192/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2022,sarahcalver,6," Beautiful but massively over-eggs the therapy speak
","A gorgeous production, and if it had only been silent and/or set to music (eg The Snowman) I would have utterly fallen in love with it. But the script is truly dreadful: every line is a contrived, cloying piece of therapy-speak. I'm all for an artfully written, subtle life lesson but this lays it on far too thick: we learn it's important to 'be kind' and that 'we are enough', among a hundred other maxims. I was braced to be told I must 'live my truth', though fortunately it didn't get that far. Maybe I'm a dreadful cynic, but rather than feeling enlightened and cheered I found the overall effect relentless preachy. Shame.",/review/rw8755192/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2023,matzucker,3," Platitudes galore
","The art style of this short is gorgeous, no doubt. And I will grant that this is made for children. But the story and dialogue are just a collection of clich√©s and platitudes so superficial that it's cringe-inducing. Given the paucity of content, 10-12 minutes would've been enough. As is, it's not just shallow, but it also drags.",/review/rw8755192/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2023,constelaciondelyra,6," Beautiful animation, not so good script
","I'm giving it more points because of the beautiful animation, which is lovely, and the beautiful message. However, the script is weak and lacks cohesion and context. It seems that they wanted to produce a traditional style tale and truffle it with pearls of wisdom. But the problem is that those philosophical quotes that everyone delivers at the first occasion are 90% of the dialogue....and that doesn't allow for a cohesive story.",/review/rw8755192/?ref_=tt_urv

","Watching this when I'm not in a good mood. The beauty, charm and authenticity of this short film led me to suspend my inner cynic.

","Beautiful animation and music aside, the tedious script of generic 'wisdom', taped together in ways that seem painfully forced, had my eyes rolling for the entire length of this piece.

24 December 2022,tcecoleshaw,6," Gorgeous animation
","As I say in the headline, the animation itself is gorgeous. CGI animation in the form of Pixar films has become wearisome and cheap and so it is really refreshing to see something akin to classic cartooning, and to draw an obvious parallel to the Snowman. Of course, the animation in the Boy... is far superior and can be savoured on its own. The story is sweet. A young lad searches for a home and befriends some animals on the way. The voice work isn't to my liking. The boy sounds a bit American. Despite who they are, the other voices felt a bit out of place for the characters they're portraying and lacking synpathy with the tone of the cartoon. And for the duration I found myself comparing the story to Animals of Farthing Wood and ultimately I was found wanting by the end. I appreciate times have changed but the story elements are a bit saccharine and woke. And the ending whilst feel-good, makes little sense when the boy needs food, water and warmth. It's a definite watch at least once but I'm not convinced I'd watch as many times as I have the Snowman , or Animals of Farthing Wood for that matter.",/review/rw8755192/?ref_=tt_urv
