19 September 2022,nikkigassner,8," How about a reivew from someone who watched it?
","Right, well it seems odd to me to negatively review a show because a) you're complaining about not being in the demographic it's geared toward, b) because this show isn't rewriting the wheel when it comes to television or c) because the actors are people in their early to mid 20's portraying college students. So first I would say, if you don't want to watch a show about college students dramas--then skip this one. This is what this show is about. There's a lot of sex and nudity, so thank God the actors aren't barely 18. Also, this is common practice and most of the actors are the same age as the Euphoria cast and some are younger. And yeah the main guy isn't super attractive to some, but he's actually not meant to be (watch the show and this is pointed out in the first or second ep). He looks sinister like he's supposed to. But he does have a great body just fyi.",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,Luce1417,7," Most toxic show ever, can't wait for season 2.
","The show starts as your typical college show with tons of nudity and parties. However is not that at all, it's about the most toxic relationship between 2 people.",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv

24 September 2022,Carpy-96811,7," Accurate Representation of a Charming Narcissist
","If anyone has ever gotten involved with one of these charming, manipulative, and narcissistic guys at a young age, this show will be so relatable to you in every way. A very accurate depiction of what I went through with someone around the age of 19 and it brought back all of the feels. The show isn't amazing, and it's a bit slow at times, but it's interesting overall. A wonderful show for late teens/young adults to watch in order to learn the warning signs of these toxic ""relationships"" and how people can affect you for years or even a lifetime. A bad person with an immense amount of charm is dangerous.",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,kysta,7," The show is decent, leaving this review because...
","I have not left a review in some time but wanted to here because felt it was worthy. Went into this series knowing very little, and much to my surprise i really enjoyed the first episode, my attention did not wavier. I like the feel of this. It's not entirely comfortable or at ease as some comments have suggested and that's literally because guess what...stuff is going to go down, so it succeeds in that without a doubt. These characters are not going to be entirely ""normal"" they have issues.",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,caglea-59487,9," Love this but I can see how this is not for everyone
","I was hooked at episode 1 and absolutely love this series. I think the male lead is exactly who he is supposed to be, and is great. The obsession that comes from a toxic relationship is real and can last for years. If you have not been in a toxic relationship, you are lucky, but this is maybe not for you - I imagine you can't relate with the female leads at all. I can, and I am so happy to see a show where the girl can't and won't change the guy...you know like in real life. I have not read the books but I will after the series so I am not sure how closely it follows the written storyline. Can't wait for Ep 5.",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2022,mccabe-shannon,8," First few episodes made me want more
","Grace Van Patten is fabulously cast as the rather aloof hard but intriguing lead. As for the male lead I don't really find him very attractive, but he does have a certain something and that's kinda discussed both when she says she likes him when she is in front of her and when the ex said it's his brain that's attractive. The side characters seem well cast too. They are believable both in college and after/present day.",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2022,Maelific71,8," Really Good
","First and foremost, this is not the type of thing I would normally watch. With this in mind, I was expecting a one and done type of venture. However, Grace Van Patten is not just a pretty face, rather, she is both beautiful and can act too which is a great combination. And frankly, Jackson White impressed me as well. I never wanted to punch someone in the face harder in my life. One cannot get a reaction out of me like that unless they are as convincing as he was.",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2022,arod_85,8," Better than the reviews suggest
","I surprisingly really enjoyed this. Some may complain that it is slow or boring but in my opinion, it had a degree of maturity and complexity that you do not see in a lot of college dramas. The actors and situations are believable. They are all have their unlikable qualities, but also have different degrees of sympathetic qualities as well. The story follows a toxic relationship over time in college through adulthood. It is unique in depicting emotional abuse as most college shows choose to portray sexual or physical. You can see how a smart and strong individual gets sucked into the relationship that she knows is doomed for failure but just can't move on from. I hope there is a season 2.",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2022,MARBLELEMON,6," Good start but I don't know...
","I just finished watching the first episode and so far so good. I think Lucy's character is great and the actress portays it well. However, I don't think Stephens character is that well played. His character is a little weird and not in the mysterious way. I don't think he or Lucy has no chemistry whatsoever and I don't think the actor who plays Stephen is that great looking himself. There's just something about him that I don't like. I wish he was more mysterious. The loss of one of the room-mates does make it a better story line and since its the first episode, I'm going to give it a go. I'm hoping it goes get better but I guess we'll have to see.",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,TheFirstAmendment,9," I am in my 40s and can relate to this story!
","I do not agree with the comment stating this show targets a specific demographic. I have dated in my 20s, 30s, & 40s. The toxicity of Steven and extreme gaslighting is far too familiar, regardless of the age of men. It is interesting to watch from a third person perspective and see it from the very beginning. The signs are always there, but new and fun creates those rose-colored glasses. I feel this show makes me realize how women should never dilute themselves for anyone, and never again allow a man's emotional issues affect you. The leading man in this show has zero emotional intelligence. He is a complete tool, and there are quite a few of those out there.",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2022,cateainsworth,8," You feel one way in the beginning, and another towards the end!! Amazing!
","So far, this is the first show to portray an accurate depiction of dating/dealing with narcissism. I noticed that the other reviews stated that Stephen seems off and creepy. Yep, he is in the beginning. He wears many masks. He's charming, then rude, arrogant, etc. In the first episode, Lucy knows that something is off- you can see she has a gut instinct about him. (At the frat party) But he's persistent (love bombing, forward ""compliments"", calls, showing up etc), and she lets her guard down.",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2022,nezthe,3," No patience for this.
","I usually give a new show2/3 eps before judging, but here we have yet another YA college drama, with the usual empty headed dialogue, with actors who look more like 30 than 18. I expect this on Netflix, but Hulu, you're better than this. Nearly every new show seems to be a ripoff of Stranger Things, Euphoria, or Game of Thrones. Lets have the next Better call Saul, or The Expanse or Banshee. There's nothing that hasn't been covered several times in the world of teen drama, so how about giving us Gen X's something we can relate to. Sorry, rant over. This 600 characters rule is a bit much, I didn't want to have to write a novel here.",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2022,richard-t-champion,9," I relived college
","It's not perfect. There are some ""no, I don't buy that"" moments that annoyed me, but all in all it made me feel something. I kind of relived my college years in some ways. Let's face it; there's a lot of relationship drama (and otherwise) in college and this delivered - to my satisfaction.",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2022,Headturner1,4," It was
","Ok until I realized the recurring theme.. Girls are doormats for the guys. The one girl claims she doesn't have feelings but is all "" I want to do it without a condom""?!? I guess she thinks he'll only want her then. The actor Jaxkson White ( who I guess is katey sagel's son) tries to come across as sexy but just sounds and looks like a serial killer. The other girl does stupid outlandish things because she thinks her guy's a player but he actually isn't. I'm no feminist but I'm sick of seeing women do outlandish things they shouldn't to keep a man. Ridiculous. Saying I need more characters...?!? Wth!!!",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,josborn5136,10," Actually I really like this show. Thanks Hulu!
",I'm actually very surprised at how much I love this show. I love the whole concept of the timeline of starting in the mid 2000's and spanning over time. That is genius. I also very much like the selection of the new faces. I will have to say the acting is particularly good. It's extremely sexy and provocative. I like the soundtrack that is set to the different scenes throughout the show. Very good song selection. The cinematography is also brilliant as well as the costumes. I guess what stands out to me the most is the ingenuity of the storyline in the perfection of the actors. This feels very euphoria mix with big little lies mixed with something else I can't put my finger on. Very original and very nice good job guys.,/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv

6 October 2022,sdimcg,1," Weak writing, annoying and unwatchable
","Ridiculously weak writing and the two main characters are played by unbelievably annoying actors. There is nothing to draw you in and keep you watching. It's just bad dialogue, gratuitous sex scenes and most actors that look way older than 18-21 range they should be for college. Maybe the book was better but I haven't read it yet. I assume we are supposed to be captivated by Lucy & Stephen's relationship but I really just want to know more about the other characters like Bree & Pippa. Lucy & Stephen deserve each other and don't need another minute of screen time because oddly enough I wish the show wasn't even about them, I wish they would just go away. Stephen is particularly irritating but Lucy is just as bad.",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2022,myappleid-40306,9," Hate all of the characters
","I watched this show because of who the show runners are but it's been hard to stick with it. It's hard to watch something when you couldn't care less what happens to any of the characters. The only ones I could maybe come close to caring about are Evan and Bree but at the end of the day I really don't. They're all toxic, horrible, and selfish. I hate Stephen and Lucy is almost just as bad. She's a b#&ch. She treats other people like garbage because of her obsession with Stephen. Anybody can see that he's trash. Are college kids really like this? The ones I've been around aren't. Maybe it's because they're rich or pretending to be. I need to see these actors in other projects to get past how horrible their characters are in this.",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2022,Jackieeeee93,8," Scary how realistic this show feels
","This show will certainly not be for everyone. It had me hooked after the first episode and I watched all 6 episodes available in 1 day. I have dated a ""Stephen"" and went to college with every character in this show, so it really resonated with me. Then again I am a 29 year old female and the type of demographic this show is geared towards, anyone over the age of 35 probably wouldn't be interested in the college drama. It's very raw and real. The acting is far superior than I expected. You can really feel the emotions the characters go through like losing your VCard to the wrong guy, or losing your college roommate in a drunk driving accident. They don't sugarcoat anything which makes it all the more realistic. I'll be honest, I thought this show would be a major flop, but I'm really happy I gave it a chance. I can see how it might be slow for some if you wait each week for a new episode, but if you watch every episode at once like I did, it's very entertaining. If you are a teen or in your 20's, give it a chance. You'll probably get hooked like myself.",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2022,ZillyPutty,6," Normal People-ish
","This show is just as exhausting as Hulu's Normal People, but the acting is very good. The male and female lead are both extremely unlikable for different reasons: He is vicious, vindictive, and gaslighting and she is vicious, vindictive, and immature. Oh wait, maybe they aren't so different : ). White is Katy Sagal's real-life son. His acting is good, but the hobbling around really contradicts his ladykiller vibe. I think that we all know men who were not the most attractive but were still great at manipulating women, so I mostly find his ""presentation"" believable. The female protagonist simply has a major, major case of being d!ckmatized. He's the first guy to make her come and she has fallen under his spell. She rages with jealousy, he rages with jealousy over his ex. They're perfectly sour together.",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,FIoret,4," I've read the book and watched the series.
",I had a real hate/love relationship with this book. I couldn't stand any of the main characters and nobody had any real redeeming or likeable qualities about them. But that's what made me love the book...I could singularly focus on the MESS they made of their lives because of extraordinary BAD decision making. The book had that charm about it. It was like reading a ole Jackie Collins book - it's all about the drama and heartbreak of horrible predatory men and laughable foolish women.,/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2022,mlemmon-57694,2," Nothing Special at All
","Here we go, another tv show about a toxic college relationship with way too much pointless sex. Don't waste your time with this one because it's nothing special. The main characters are completely unlikable and flat in their acting- it's hard to care about them or their storylines because they are so unlikable. The main male character, Stephen, comes across as slimy and almost rapey at times and you have a hard time believing that the main female character, Lucy, is drawn to him, and Stephen and Lucy's chemistry is lukewarm at best. The writers go overboard to show how unappealing and toxic this character is almost to a laughable degree. The show lacks focus and is confusing to watch, almost making you wish it was already over. Moreover, it romanticizes toxic relationships, and to the demographic it is intended for, it sets a bad example for women as victims. Don't waste your time.",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2022,danielmartinx,7," Horrible but you should watch it
","Horrible but you should watch it. The characters are barely even one to mentional. They are 0.5 dimensional. Every character enters every scene with motivation to be unpleasant and to say vague unpleasant things to the other characters. Even the drama is weak. Somebody drove around a corner fast and another car swerved to miss them, so that first driver is a murderer? Really? I don't think that's how it happens.",/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,khavkinf,9," Enjoying this one
",Don't get all the hate. I'm glad I decided to watch it anyway. So far it's got me hooked and I watched all 3 episodes in one day. Yes the male lead isn't exceptionally gorgeous but I think that's the point. She even says she only like him when he's in front of her. It's about his charm and well ..he's got game. A lot of talking so if you're more in action skip this. I on the other hand like it and I can see his appeal to girls.,/review/rw8530710/?ref_=tt_urv
