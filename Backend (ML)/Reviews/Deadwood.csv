6 July 2021,Sleepin_Dragon,9," Well that was a surprise.
","I have to swallow humble pie here, I'm not a fan of Clarkson as a rule, I was told I'd enjoy this, in truth I absolutely loved it, it's a wonderful series.",/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2021,jcmark-66725,10," Jeremy Clarkson points a TV crew at the brilliance of real farmers
","Many people are criticizing this show already (see the horrendous Lucy Mangan review in the Guardian), but seem to have either not watched the series or completely misunderstood Jeremy Clarkson's goal. Clarkson is a mostly useless tool on his farm and he makes decisions seemingly guided by blind luck and assumption...which is utterly on brand and perfectly reflects the real challenges of farming.",/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2021,ilcool90,10," Shows what an actual backbreaking work it is to run a farm
",Absolutely love the show. Clarkson's humor is of-course epic. But this show actually shows what utter hard labor it is to produce the food we eat and how much annoying bureaucratic nonsense farmers have to jump through because politicians that know diddly-squat about farming introduced it based on advice from some hippies.,/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2021,scottedwards-87359,10," Top quality entertainment
",... and very educational too. I would like to do this review in the words of Gerald:,/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2021,gd-parry,9," Sad to see it over so quick
",It's one of those shows - like James May In Japan - that you can just zip through without realising. Seeing so much going on and then it's over.,/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2021,djurrepower,9," One of the best shows I've seen in a long time
","The show stays close to its roots in 'top gear' and 'grand tour'. The humor and overall culture, that difines the feel of top gear, is presented in it's best form. Biggest difference here is that there are far less pranks. Although the humor is still mostly the usual what you would expect from Clarkson. But the show does take itself a little more serious. And I would say it turned out great.",/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2021,tzarhusky,9," Could of been tedious....
",But wasn't.,/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2021,horton-78367,10," Love him or hate him , this is still pure genius
","For some reason Clarkson gets a lot of hate from social media , when in all honesty, the man is quite simply brilliant, thoroughly entertaining series , watched all 8 ep in one sitting , please don't go back to London, we all want a series 2 then 3 and so on until you hand the farm to kaleb and I'll no doubt watch him too üëç",/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2021,gina_gemini,9," Classic Clarkson
",Great show with that classic type of entertainment this man has gifted the world with for all these years.,/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2021,idiocracy_l,9," Clarkson did a thing.
","I binged this over two days, and i loved it. The best part was that Gerald had no subtitles, no one has a clue what he is saying.",/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2021,40milesanhour,10," Entertaining (Obviously) and Educative
","One of my relatives had quite a farm in the old village and he used to invite us there. One time when I've got there, first thing I've thought about that farming is a hard and tiresome work and I'll never be interested. This series have the honour to make me feel interested in farming.",/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2021,g-89622,10," Modern mechanized agriculture is really complicated and profound
","Modern mechanized agriculture is really complicated and profound. You have to know not only the crops and animals, but also the rules and regulations, and be able to operate and maintain the machinery, and solve the storage and marketing problems. Uncle Jeremy's bewilderment and helplessness in the face of such a complex undertaking and all sorts of unexpected setbacks is a real schadenfreude.",/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2021,chunkylefunga,9," Curveball that is actually great
","First off, they definitely need to make season 2.",/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2021,AbhiSh4ke,10," From a farmer's perspective
","This show is pure gold and I hope that more seasons follow because I have been continuously laughing like a maniac watching this. The small things the knee injury, the lever, the sheep it's all premium television. Anybody giving this a negative review either has a bias against Clarkson or has no sense of humour at all. Just watch it one hour and you'll be hooked especially if you are a farmer because you literally see yourself in Caleb & Kevin and notice everything. Again this is television GOLD.",/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2021,rehmankhilji,10," It a must see show
",Have remained a fan of Top Gear over the years (idiotic BBC for ending it) and Grand Tour will always remain one of the finest shows ever i have seen.,/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2021,ngyrjzqmrb,10," Pure gold!
","I don't know what else to say than pure gold. Clarkson at his best, surrounded by great people. 10/10. Haven't written a review before, but this deserved it.",/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2021,sheikhmansour,10," Binge watching heaven
",Absolutely brilliant. Has had me in hysterics and had me on the verge of tears. The Top Gear buffoon but also the personal emotional side of the man who does love nature and animals. Farming through the eyes of the rank amateur is great for the vast majority of us who know nothing about it.,/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2021,bilishka,10," Farming Orangutan
","Surprisingly a very entertaining show. Personally, as a car enthusiast, I still enjoyed this show a lot.",/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2021,amritsreenivas,10," This show will probably go into my top 3 favourites of all time.
","Farming is difficult, is a torture and if there isn't any govt. Aid, you'd be stuck in a debt trap and resort to suicide that happens so often in India. Very few lucky next generation people like me were able to get a college education is able to come out of this vicious cycle because your previous generation sacrificing so much by dealing with all the beauracracy and politics.",/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2021,cmtaylor-10993,9," Fantastic
","It's been so long since Clarkson's last proper solo project. Yes, I know he's become a game show presenter on ITV but prior to then it's been the best part of 2 decades since his last proper solo show. I loved Speed, Extreme Machines, Meet the Neighbours and even Motorworld from the mid 1990s, simply because of",/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2021,crumpytv,10," Excellent Entertainment.
",Very interesting and entertaining.,/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2021,KyleDial,9," A feel good family show
","I didn't know much about Jeremy Clarkson before watching Clarkson's Farm or what to expect with this show, but I was pleasantly surprised by his charming nature and brilliantly done narration.",/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2021,Airman87,8," Miles better than Amazon's disaster called ""The Great Escapists""
","In true reality show drama there is no doubt an element of staged artificialness to it, but what this show gets right, is that it has moments of genuineness and off-the-cuff punchlines that deliver.",/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2021,trudjoh,10," Caleb isss by a Star!!
","Such a great show. Funny, informative, just delightful. The locals including Gerald are the best!!",/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2021,jljacobi,9," Majorly entertaining, Fascinating.
","If you hate Clarkson, and more than a few people do, you're likely going not going to want to watch this show. Not because it isn't wonderful TV, but because it might just change your mind about the person.",/review/rw7075637/?ref_=tt_urv
