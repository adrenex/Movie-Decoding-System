29 December 2019,swordsnare,8," Kudos for No Laugh Track.
","For someone who usually finds Chuck Lorre's work a little much, this was a genuine surprise. I suppose no laugh track, like Big Bang Theory, Two And Half Men, etc, certainly helps. Alan Arkin's delivery is hilarious and dry as ever. Good seeing some actors and actresses that I haven't seen in a while also.",/review/rw7186345/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2018,leftbanker-1,10," LOVED THIS (AND LATELY I HATE EVERYTHING)
",Wonderful! That first episode is going to be a very hard act to follow. It was funny and romantic and sad and thoroughly charming at every turn. What a terrific cast and such a crazy mix of tremendously successful and experienced actors with a bunch of first timers (at least it's the first time I've seen many of them).,/review/rw7186345/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2019,ariak-49682,10," The Second Season is even better than the first!!
","Just started the second season, finished the second episode!I must say this is even better than the first, season!!Way way better!Great acting, great cast and the comedy is hysterical, really good!So far everything and everyone, I mean Kathleen Turner, Paul Reiser and Jane Seymour, I mean everyone is great!!
They just fit the part!!!Truely well done!
You won't be disappointed!!",/review/rw7186345/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2018,Herbalicious_690,10," Outstanding in every way
","Chuck Lorre does it again. What a cast !! Cameos are a who's who list. The script writing is top notch. The acting is stellar, on point, engaging, believable. And funny !! Don't overlook this show, or dismiss it at first glance, you will be missing out on something special. Many shows take quite a few episodes for the cast to reach the closeness and flow of a really strong ""ensemble"", but this steps right in. Experience in all domains shows strongly - funny, witty, insightful, cutting at times, fresh, relatable, just wonderful. Watch it and spread the word.",/review/rw7186345/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2018,Danckersen,10," FLAT OUT EXCELLENT
","A MASTERPIECE of wit! Chuck Lorre has outdone himself. Somewhat similar to Grace & Frankie(so if you love that show, you will be ALL OVER THIS), but ACTUALLY a step up. In their late 70's to early 80's, Douglas and Arkin rock. INCREDIBLE chemistry. I am mad, as I needed to get some work done today, but was sucked into binging!!!! Enjoy!",/review/rw7186345/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2019,bruce-129,," I'll make this short and sweet ... Great job - 10/10
","""The Kominsky Method"" is, in my humble opinion, by far, the best and most significant thing Michael Douglas has ever done or probably ever will do. For the sitcom genre, it is sublime. It has all the elements of comedy and tragedy and as they say punches way about it's weight.",/review/rw7186345/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2018,arc-67711,10," WOW....
","Funny, witty, sad, and emotional.. Great teamwork between two actors that had never worked together.. Superb acting all the way around.. There better be a second season..",/review/rw7186345/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2021,johnharapa,10," STUNNINGLY BRILLIANT
","I can't remember a show so well written, so much chemistry between the two main characters and how much I've UTTERLY enjoyed this show.",/review/rw7186345/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2018,jon_anderson77,9," Watch it, it's brilliant
",Douglas and Arkin are perfect in this comedy drama full of dark humour and heartbreaking sentiment. It won't be for everyone but what do they know. Do yourself a favour and watch this,/review/rw7186345/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2021,jordan2240,6," 8 for first 2 seasons, 4 for last
","Unfortunately, the writer had to write around Alan Arkin quitting the series (from what I'd read, he'd only ever intended to do 2 seasons), and it didn't quite work. Other characters had to be featured, and they weren't particularly interesting. Clever to see Douglas and Turner back together, but Turner bears no resemblance to her 'Romancing the Stone' self, and can be painful to watch. The storyline with Arkin's character's daughter and grandson got tedious and ridiculous, and the whole season simply felt like it existed simply because Netflix had promised a 3rd season. Disliked the last show most of all. Recommend the first 2 seasons, but not the 3rd.",/review/rw7186345/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2018,SpursNo1,10," Douglas & Arkin At Their Best

29 May 2021,Calicodreamin,8," An honest comedy
",An honest comedy helmed by acting greats. Micheal Douglas is an amazing lead actor and has great chemistry with costars Arkin and Turner. The episode storylines are well developed and bring both drama and comedy. The highs will make you laugh and the lows will make you cry. A great show.,/review/rw7186345/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2021,firti,7," Didnt need season 3
",This is such a disappointing final season it was a 10 first 2 seasons and doing third season without Alan Arkin and putting in very annoying characters! The episodes are already short they are 25 minutes each and whole season 6 episodes and full of repeating the same jokes & dialogs! What were you thinking.,/review/rw7186345/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2018,darnellestreet,10," So what do I do now that I've binged watched it twice already?
","It is so refreshing to watch something that appeals to audiences over 50. The subject matter is relevant, the acting is excellent and the only negative is that I've got to wait until next season to see new episodes... and I can't wait!",/review/rw7186345/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2018,ihtf,10," Fantastic Fun
","Wish it was 30 episodes... fun, great writing, adult stuff.",/review/rw7186345/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2021,suego-49293,8," Solid 8 stars overall, 5 for the last season
","I truly love this show. But what made it work best was the relationship between Douglas and Arkin. When Arkin left it took a lot of the wind out of their sails. But bringing in Kathleen Turner was brilliant and except for one line she uttered when first waking up in the hospital (something about her ex-husband, Douglas, giving great head, which was gross since she said it to her daughter - gag!) her character was funny, crass, strong, vulnerable and spot on.",/review/rw7186345/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2021,douglasmcbroom,9," Sheer Brilliance
","The writing is superb-adult. It defies the boring, eye-rolling, rhythms of TV sit-coms. It should have won every Emmy for which it was nominated. I know this is supposed to be Michael Douglas' vehicle, but for me, Alan Arkin steals the show. He has deadpanned sarcasm down to an art form. The chemistry between Douglas and Arkin is extraordinary and such fun to watch. That is why I will not be watching Season 3, because Arkin will not be back. So the Season 2 finale, with Douglas and Arkin clinking glasses, is the perfect series ending for me. There were three guest stars I didn't even recognize, but I knew their voices: Paul Reiser, Kathleen Turner and Haley Joel Osment. Of the regular supporting cast, Susan Sullivan, Sarah Baker, Nancy Travis and Lisa Edlestein are all terrific. I wish they would give Graham Rogers more to do as I thought he was excellent in 'Ray Donovan' and again herein he shows his chops. I expect big things from this guy. So I guess I'll just have to rewatch the first two seasons of this way to short slice of brilliance.",/review/rw7186345/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2018,shuman-58489,10," A Must to Binge Watch
","Well, Chuck Lorre has done it again. He managed to team two great actors who had never worked together and come up with a 2018 answer to Matthau and Lemmon.
Laughter,Tears and a bit of Bawdiness made me eagerly sit through 4 hours, with hopes of another season to come.",/review/rw7186345/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2018,niccobates,8," Class act
","While Michael Douglas is the acting teacher, it's Alan Arkin who delivers the master class in comedic timing. Delightful all round based on four episodes.",/review/rw7186345/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2021,misscharlietaylor,7," Brilliant until Season 3
","Season 1 & 2 were brilliant, so funny and very cleverly written, but then Season 3 without Arkin was a real let down, and to suddenly have Seymour's character acting like a deranged crazy person in the first episode, after being so level headed in the previous season, was just weird. I lost interested after the first episode, and it didn't draw me back in.",/review/rw7186345/?ref_=tt_urv
