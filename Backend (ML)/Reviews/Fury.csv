26 June 2005,TOMASBBloodhound,9," The unthinkable: A good film in this day and age about high school.
","Though my own high school days are well behind me now, this film received enough acclaim that I was convinced to give it a try. Mean Girls did in fact prove to be a rewarding experience. The film made a ton of money and launched some of its young stars into orbit.",/review/rw4439907/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2017,atlasmb,7," Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams Square Off
","""Mean Girls"" feels perfectly suited to Lindsay Lohan's talents. As the new girl in school (Cady Heron) who is trying to fit in, she is extremely likable. She becomes fast friends with Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan, who nails her performance. If you are not familiar with singer Janis Ian, check out her hit single ""Seventeen"") and Damian (Daniel Franzese), but gets sucked into a three-girls clique called the Plastics. With her allegiance split between the two factions, she finds herself becoming a person she does not like.",/review/rw4439907/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is an easy one to enjoy over and over again. I think how funny you find the story is relative to your age. As someone newly out of high school, I can tell you that the high school clicks portrayed in this film are a bit far-fetched. I have never heard someone say ""you can't sit with us"" or of being called ""too gay to function"". This movie is still simply witty and smart with a story line that is far different from the main stream movies that come out today.",/review/rw4439907/?ref_=tt_urv

","Rosalind Wiseman wrote the novel that Tina Fey adapted for the screen. The result, ""Mean Girls"" is a statement about what it's like to be a student going through high school today. In fact, it presents an ugly side about how school, a place for lasting friendships, camaraderie, and just a place for learning is everything but that, according to what one witnesses. In fact, in order to navigate its cliques and groups, one needs a route map in order not to offend anyone. ""Mean Girls"" is directed by Mark Waters, who gives it a light touch.",/review/rw4439907/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," Smart, dark and fun teen comedy!
","I thought this a really entertaining film. With a spirited cast, a very good script, a good soundtrack and a nice romance what more could you possibly want? Lindsey Lohan is lovely as Cady Heron, better than she was in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen. She is given great support from an excellent supporting cast, from the likes of Tina Fey and Rachel McAdams. The script was dark and humorous, my favourite bit was when all the girls start fighting after they discover that they are being badmouthed in a book. And there is always time for a romance that doesn't always interfere with the story. In fact, my only real complaint is that it gets a little sentimental, but apart from that, an enjoyable and engaging film, with a 8/10. Bethany Cox",/review/rw4439907/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film is entertaining to this day. I have watched it half a dozen times and laugh and feel burned every time.
Over every viewing I feel that this film has fun characters, cute girls, good versus evil and is value driven.
Watch it (again).",/review/rw4439907/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2005,dedebee,9," Being bad has never been so good....
","The teen-movie genre returns with ""Mean Girls,"" and it comes back with a vengeance. What could have been a tired and clichéd retread of ""Heathers"" is actually a clever and witty flick thanks to the talents of screenwriter Tina Fey. Fey, head writer for ""Saturday Night Live"" and co-anchor of their ""Weekend Update,"" has an amazing flair for satire, and what better way to showcase it than with a analytical glimpse at the world of high school cliques? Lindsay Lohan is Cady, the previously home-schooled daughter of two zoologists, growing up in the African wilderness while Mom and Dad conduct their research. When the 'rents decide to settle down, Cady gets her first taste of public schooling, which is almost as wild as the jungles and safaris she's used to. Cady is introduced to the different factions that populate the cafeteriaincluding the nympho band geeks, the nerdy Asians, the cool Asians, the varsity jocks and of course, the Plastics, teen royalty led by the manipulative Regina George (Rachel McAdams).",/review/rw4439907/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2004,RossNolan,8," Best Teen Movie since 'Clueless'?
","I have to admit that despite being a straight, 22 year old guy I have always had a weakness for teen films so I was looking forward to Lindsay Lohan's (who really impressed me in 'Freaky Friday' and the much underrated 'Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen') latest.",/review/rw4439907/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2004,dicksosa,7," Why you should see the movie
","Although this movie is no Heathers in its cruelness it still has comical wit and crass jokes.  The movie basically takes a girl who has never been to public school until she was 16, as she's been in Africa with her parents, and throws her into to her Junior year of high school.  Now that in itself is a decent plot that can either lead to a movie full of wisely placed cracks or a horrible flop.  This film is much more the former. ",/review/rw4439907/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2004,CuriosityKilledShawn,8," I liked it at first, but I do not like Lohan at all anymore.
","I knew nothing of this movie before I saw it. In fact I only went to see because I have a crush on Lindsay Lohan and I really liked her in Freaky Friday. So it was quite a payoff when it turned out to be quite fun film and nothing like the dreadful teen comedies we've suffered too much off in the past five years (making love to pies, losing ones' car and certain Scary Movies).",/review/rw4439907/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2005,claudio_carvalho,7," Silly and Funny Teen Comedy
","The teenager Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) has just arrived in United State of America, after being raised in Afrika without going to conventional school. Their parents are zoologists, and her mother has been her tutor and she was educated at home-school, being an excellent student in mathematics. When she arrives in the high-school, she looks for a spot in one of the groups, becoming friend of the rejected Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan), unfairly called of lesbian by the other girls, and the gay Damian (Daniel Franzese). When The Plastics, the most closed clique in the school leaded by the evil Regina George (Rachel McAdams), invites her to join their selected group, Cady accepts the invitation, trying to reach their dark secrets to disclose to her friends, but later she changes her behavior with her friends. When she has a crush on the former boy-friend of Regina, Aaron Samuels, Regina looks for revenge, plotting an evil plan against Cady. ""Mean Girls"" is a silly and funny teen movie, supported mainly by the gorgeous and charismatic Lindsay Lohan. The story explores the behavior of the teenagers, trying to find their true personality while molding their characters. The cast is very funny, and the story is totally based on the American culture and behavior of the American teenagers. Anyway, it is a good entertainment. My vote is seven.",/review/rw4439907/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2016,Horst_In_Translation,8," Entertaining and relevant, Lohan's brightest hour perhaps
","""Mean Girls"" is an American high school film from over ten years ago and, by some, these 95 minutes are considered a modern classic today. I cannot blame them. I was very much entertained watching this one. There was hardly a minute that did not have some (at least) decent humor to it. The biggest strength of this film is that it never takes itself too seriously. Yes there are dramatic scenes, but they all come with an ounce of humor. The best example is perhaps people being hit by buses, a running gag throughout the entire film. Another example would be Lohan's final speech, during which the headmaster brings the comic relief. This is exactly how comedies should handle the subject of dramatic moments. Tina Fey did an outstanding job with the script here and it's a shame she did not get an Oscar nomination for her adaptation of Rosalind Wiseman's book.",/review/rw4439907/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2004,P-kin3,," Fun & worth seeing
","""Mean Girls"" is a fun movie that can be enjoyed thoroughly by the adult set as well as its seeming target audience, teens. The flick opens up with Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) embarking on her first day of the jungle that is high school ever as she has been home-schooled in Africa her whole life. After some initial bumps in the road, she manages to befriend two ""artsy"" misfits, Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and Damian (Daniel Franzese). Surprisingly, however, she is also quickly welcomed into the Plastics, a group of uber-popular girls who seem to be simultaneously admired and resented by all. On Janis's urgings, Cady infiltrates the Plastics, and her mission becomes personal when the Plastics leader, Regina (Rachel McAdams), stabs Cady in the back.",/review/rw4439907/?ref_=tt_urv

13 April 2021,dskywalker0,7," Over 10 years old and still entertaining
","This has become a classic because it's the ultimate chick flick: it shows how mean girls can be towards each other. It's a necessary message embedded in a funny, silly film with some really good actors, such as a young Rachel McAdams, although I also have to admit I'm a little biased because it was a part of my own coming of age - I grew up wearing pink on Wednesdays. It's valid entertainment IMO.",/review/rw4439907/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2006,tom_sto86,10," So Fetch
","Mean Girls isn't your average teen comedy, which you can tell are written by adults who have no insight into the social politics that revolve around teenage life, and who consequently divide everyone into two groups - cool (jocks and cheerleaders) and uncool (goths and science nerds). And it is this inherent understanding of teen life, that writer Tina Fey has applied to the film which makes it stand out, and such a pleasure to watch.",/review/rw4439907/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 2004,george.schmidt,," ""So fetch!"" One of the funniest and best high school comedies ever!
","MEAN GIRLS (2004) **** Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert, Amanda Seyfried, Tina Fey, Lizzy Caplan, Daniel Franzese, Tim Meadows, Amy Poehler, Ana Gasteyer, Neil Flynn, Jonathan Bennett. Hysterically funny teen comedy that supercedes its expectations beyond belief with Lohan as a recently transplanted home school girl from the African veldt to the jungles of atypical American high school as she attempts to acclimate herself amongst the vast cliques and inner circles of the hellish life as a teenager trying to fit in by any means necessary. Fey (who plays the surprisingly sane math teacher) wrote the sharp, clever and wickedly funny screenplay loosely based on the non-fiction teen treatise 'Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence' by Rosalind Wiseman that allows the cartoony to mingle smoothly with keenly observant reflections of just how accurate and treacherous it is to be a teenager no matter what type they fall into. Lohan gives a star making turn as Cady Heron the smart newcomer whose trickery devised by her first friends Caplan and Franzese (the Goth and the Gay, both are brilliantly hilarious with their brittle one-liners and zingers at the expense of others) to infiltrate the Plastics (McAdams, Chabert and Seyfried channeling The Stepford Wives meets Barbie) and eventually cause them to self-destruct. The comedy never lets up (I can't recall laughing out loud at least four times BEFORE the opening credits finished! My favorite recurring bit is one of the Plastics' younger sisters grinding in front of her television to the likes of Britney Spears etc. Directed by Mark S. Waters with comic verve ranks alongside such high school classics as Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Heathers and any of John Hughes' oeuvre. One of the best and funniest films of the year.",/review/rw4439907/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2004,=G=,7," The square root of ""Clueless""
","""Mean Girls"" is another bop fodder comedy about a high school junior who, having been outschooled all her life, goes to public school and tries to become one of the in crowd, a trio of shallow hotties called the ""Plastics"", only to find she's become a back stabbing beyotch like them and subsequently realizing the error of her ways...yada-yada-yada. Always lively and light hearted, this slampoonfest of the teen female's peer pressure cooker problems is a fun romp full of the usual high school peer group stereotypes all slogging their way through campus social life. Fresh and funny if a tad silly (ok, a lot silly), ""Mean Girls"" will play best with teen females. (B)",/review/rw4439907/?ref_=tt_urv
