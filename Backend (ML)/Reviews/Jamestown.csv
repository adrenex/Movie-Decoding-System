16 May 2017,fandomfatale,8," Entertaining, soapy fun
","I checked out the reviews on here before I watched the first episode, and proceeded despite the overall negativity. I'm glad I did - I was hooked right away and I won't find the wait until the next episode easy. ",/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2017,scvj-06911,4," Well acted ridiculous script
","I thought, ""oooh, from the producers of Downtown Abbey, that bodes well."" I quickly decided that the producers should have stayed in the 19th - early 20th centuries, and across the pond. There's only so much suspension of disbelief one can expect from a viewer, and this is Historical Fiction not SciFi/Fantasy.",/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2019,Bill-412,1," Insultingly terrible
","Headstrong, 21st century women sashay into the 1620s and take over the men and the settlement, despite actual history and social conventions. Typical PBS agenda, worse revisionism even than Victoria. Also demeaning, cliched portrayal of native americans, and of devout Christians.",/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2020,xiomatic,3," Not a serious historical drama
","I barely made it through the first episode. I won't be watching the rest. I am a fan of historical shows and was looking forward to this one. But this is just trash. I would rather shows like this were not made than trash like this served up. No attempt has been made to any kind of authenticity; aside from period costumes and mud, this could be set in modern LA or NY. But worse, even if you accept that it is simply modern soap in costumes, the plot and characters are just unbelievable. Literally cardboard cutout boo-hiss characters and pretty women being oppressed.",/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2017,Kallithrix,," Great cast & premise wasted on a poorly written script
","It looked really promising - heavily touted as a period drama about the arrival of women in the new world colony that has been solely inhabited by men for 16 years. What a great concept! Plenty of tension and conflict in that! But there just isn't. Tension between the sexes seems to fizzle almost immediately as all the women settle into their relationships with barely a murmur - Verity complains more than most, but even she doesn't seem overly bothered about being sold in marriage to the local drunk. And the early thwarted romance, which might have provided romantic tension and some much needed 'will they/won't they?' drama, is unthwarted by episode two. ",/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2017,ppco89,4," Great Acting but the script fails
","I thought the acting was very good and the characters worthy, but right from the beginning the script was lacking and you notice things are off. Coming out of the water or the woods and the character is spiffy clean? the clothes are not perfectly period, though that won't bother many, the ship mooring as some others have mentioned, and honestly, a gay man wearing an earring in the open, in such a tough society? he'd have been flogged and tossed off the ship before it even landed. I found too many things that were not believable and a script lacking. Too bad because I love period drama's.",/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2019,dtdenver-987-925546,3," Silly, shallow, inaccurate
",What I've noticed most after two episodes that that the pretty girls cast as the leads always have contact lenses that carefully match their clothing. The pretty boys have the current 3-day-old scruffy beard at all times. The casting is millennial stereotypes in the Shona Rimes mold and anyone over 40 is either vile or stupid.,/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2017,politicon2003,3," What a waste of good actors and what a poor production.
","What a waste of good actors and what a poor production. This is more a Harlequin novel adaptation than a serious attempt to provide an informative yet entertaining series. Within a minute of the beginning a clumsy cog about 100 years out of fashion survives a nasty Atlantic storm. The weather clears and a Caribbean blue sky dominates. One of the imported brides has died and her corpse consigned to the sea. All of the young women have had time and space to clean themselves up (How did the Avon lady get aboard?). In my life time I have crossed the Atlantic many times but by the time one reaches the Americas in five hours one is totally wasted; turbulence or not, regardless of a first class or economy class passage. Here we see the lovely freshly made up young girls emerging from confined smelly cabin spaces to land and proceed to their allotted stranger husbands (no preview videos available). Reminds me of the modern Greek movie 'Brides' or the reality of Les Files Du Roi, young would be French brides given each a small hand box of low value jewels as a dowry by the French king to help populate New France. That at least is real history. Back to the beginning; the first shot of the ship's ensign is the Union Jack, 100 years too early it was adopted only as a result of the Act of Union between Scotland and England in 1707.",/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2017,damian-183,7," Great Fun
","I can't see what the other reviewers are worried about. This show isn't meant to be a historical documentary, it's a brain out the box piece of pop corn silliness, and as that it's very good. The acting is fine, the scenery is beautiful and who cares if they aren't covered in mud all the time. I enjoyed the historically inappropriate over strong women and the fun story line. I enjoyed the show and will watch the rest with enjoyment without over analysing it.",/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2017,jonnithomas,2," This is really weak
",The plot is weak on a subject which could have been excellent. The blonde character is supposed to be manipulating people but her actions and motives are laughable. She is far too transparent and it lacks any realism.,/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2019,ef-45789,4," Promising story line torpedoed by BIZARRE script
","I have watched all 16 episodes, and at times have been entertained. It's got everything: racism (against native americans); more racism (against african slaves); misogyny; homophobia; and even intersex discrimination (that's right they even have a poor hermaphrodite!) The producers and writers must have been smoking something (that's another thing- glorification of Big Tobacco).
The script has some ""historical"" characters and some fictional characters, but the Governor of Virginia, George Yeardley, is depicted as a power mad, morally bankrupt psychopath; if there are any Yeardley descendants around they should sue for slander.
So bottom line, I have to say that compared to most of the crap that is on TV these days, this series rates a watch but what a shame that they couldn't hire some writers....",/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2019,rmadigan55,1," What a joke
","Since I live across the James River from Jamestown, I figured I would watch this show. I am a history buff and love well made shows of historical subjects. The first time I watched the show I wondered if I was watching a music video. I kept waiting for the music to start. I thought what part of Jamestown did the producers research for the show. I watched about 5 minutes of it and switched channels. Now, a few months later I tuned into tonight's episode. Well it hasn't gotten much better. Since when did women of the early 1600s wear a low neck dress that showed cleavage? And the out spoken women...serving drinks in a bar. Not in early Jamestown.",/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2017,furryoldman,1," Yawn
","Not sure how this passed the pre screenings. Poorly done, over acted,real nasty depiction of early settlers, but at least their clothes are clean and they always self clean, even after wolf attacks. Wait a minute, wolf attacks! When did that ever happen? Not sure any of the writers ever did more than open an encyclopedia and look up Jamestown. Not sure how they think they can get a large 17th century cargo vessel deep in the mouth of a river and moored at a 20 foot dock either. So I suspect no one on the writing staff has ever been near a large ship or out on the water. Really cannot believe people are being paid real money to produce erroneous cliché ridden nonsense like this, but I guess they are. Snore.",/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2018,itisnotme,2," Complete fiction
","I wonder how these ""historical"" shows get made. Women pretty much running the colony; men and women who first meet and immediately call each other by first names; public displays of affection between those not married, etc.
I'm cannot imagine the hardship these people faced, but, very little is historical truth. If you think about it, public displays of affection are still frowned on by many people today! At that time in history, women were completely subservient to men. If you publicly spoke out against what a man said, the least of your punishment would be flogging. It is so very sad that the writers evidently did not read any of the old letters and journals that were kept from that time. I am so disappointed. I had really looked forward to this.",/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2017,MeMeTellem,3," Not much of a story line, is it?
","A colony of men are on land to work on or purchase their own land. Ran by higher anarchy of men, who regulate laws and oversee the ""town"". Certain men have their chance to purchase a wife, as they do so, the women are sent to the town, by ship, to serve the men as their wives. At first, when the women arrive, men are smitten, forceful, and aggressive over the women they would like to marry. Along the way, The women stick up for themselves and help their husbands through their troubles. Some, however, fall in love with men who are not their husbands. ",/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2017,pfgpowell-1,1," Two dimensional twaddle for the Great Unwashed
","The note in the introductory credits 'from the producers of Downton Abbey' should have alerted us. Those who just simply loved, loved, loved Downton and thought it was the acme of contemporary drama will have been beside themselves with anticipation when they saw the trailers for Jamestown and undoubtedly as I write are gushing about how really, really, really brilliant Jamestown is. The rest of us (I gave Downton ten minutes and gave up) will sigh and know exactly what to expect. Last night I watched the first episode and got exactly what I expected.",/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2018,hesketh27,8," Totally hooked & hoping for a third series!
",Am now halfway through box set of Series 2 on NowTV and loving every minute of it! I am addicted to historical drama / fiction but if you are expecting much accuracy in 'Jamestown' then forget it. The acting quality ranges from excellent to poor but any shortcomings are compensated for by the attractive ensemble cast and lush photography that makes full use of the stunning scenery - this show is beautiful to look at. It's very easy to become totally involved in the life of the characters as this is purely and simply a soap opera in fancy dress. Don't bother to analyse - switch off your brain for 50 minutes sit back and enjoy!,/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2018,blondicrivitz,9," Good Entertainment
","I've seen people whining that it isn't historically accurate. But I've yet to see a show that truly is. This show is everything it needs to be. Thrilling, captivating and well acted. Period dramas are just that, dramas, set in history. It's not a documentary so if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere. Great and entertaining show.",/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2019,rubya,7," Don't expect a docudrama
","If you expect a factual, realistic and historically based drama, this is not the show for you.
If you are looking for simple entertainment value and not having to think too hard, this show does pretty good.
The characters are good if a little caricatural with the obviously good and honourable James Read, the nasty greedy Governor Yardley and the scheming and sneaky Widow Castel. There is a hint of depth to them but nothing that will make you wonder very much.
Yet you start to like some of them and hope they'll prevail.",/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2019,jchap1022,2," Disappointing
","My PBS station finally started airing this series after the interest it generated. I found it historically inaccurate and the location was not even in North America but in Hungary. Overly melodramatic, it was like watching ""East Enders"" and ""Downton Abby"" transported back in time to the American frontier. I gave up after two episodes.",/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2019,nqe56072,9," Jamestown is compelling & important.
","I rarely pen reviews of films etc on IMDb but there don't seem to be many regarding the PBS TV series Jamestown, or what reviews there are are pretty negative, and I think that's just unfortunate. I also don't like to write about topics I know very little about, the real history of Jamestown belonging firmly in that category. I don't want to write much here, but I would like to at least state that I thought the series was very good, and that it deserves more attention than it seems to have received. Well, now that it's been cancelled after only three seasons, it can at least claim fellowship with another TV show which went on to have an enormously successful afterlife: Star Trek!",/review/rw4307121/?ref_=tt_urv
