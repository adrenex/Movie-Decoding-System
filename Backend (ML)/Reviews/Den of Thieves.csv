25 November 2017,Sleepin_Dragon,10," Compulsive viewing.
","It feels like ages since we've had a Private Investigator series on mainstream TV, enter Cormoran Strike, from a series of books penned by J.K. Rowling. I have to admit my expectations were high, and after ten minutes of watching The Cuckoo's Calling I realised I wasn't to be let down. This series is absolutely incredible, of course the plots and production values are impeccable as would be inspected, but it's the performances and character play that are the key. Tom Burke, always a quality actor, has possibly found his star role as Strike, he is absolutely brilliant, as is Holliday Grainger, the pair work beautifully together.",/review/rw6073855/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2017,reneedlittle,9," Must watch
","Excellent cast, dynamic story line, unique cinematography all combine for an outstanding series. The nonexistence of over the top completely impossible special effects is refreshing. It's intelligent and sophisticated in it's execution. There is no quick fix to each case, yet the writers don't drag the story along simply to fill time and episodes, instead time is utilized efficiently and very effectively creating a great deal of intrigue and suspense which will keep you up at night to watch an episode instead of going to bed. A definite must watch series.",/review/rw6073855/?ref_=tt_urv

","Absolutely love this series, this programme. Really clever stories with depth and great characters. But what takes it to another level is the perfect casting of Tom Burke and Holliday Grainger. They are just perfect. Not perfect characters, certainly, damaged in their own ways, but living a life, real - and that is the best approval rating you can give. They feel real people, with real problems. But living a real life. But Tom and Holliday just inhabit these people. And the expertise that JKR produced in creating the Potter characters, she has done again in this real, true to life situation. Just one complaint. They will only make a programme based on an original JKR story. So she needs to write faster. Need more Strike and Robin.",/review/rw6073855/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2017,marycat-22297,9," Classy.
","'Strike: The Cuckoo's Calling' is on the Poirot-Marple-Midsomers branch of the mystery tree with its irresistible stars in the lead roles, its slow but never time-wasting character developments, its high-on- thinking and low-on-physical-violence story, and its beautiful camera work. If you like all of the above features and a good, escape-for-an- hour mystery, please watch this. J.K. Rowling wrote the book and I'm glad that the British television peeps had the great good sense to bring this to us as beautifully as they did. I hope they make more.",/review/rw6073855/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2020,classicsoncall,8," ""It's not too late to be on the right side of this one.""
","It's unfortunate that this British TV series is listed the way it is on this site. I would have liked to review the individual complete stories, but breaking up the series the way it's done here makes it rather difficult. Could still do it by making entries for Part 1 of each episode, but that seems rather a moot point. I came upon the series of novels quite by accident at my local library about a year ago and was intrigued enough by the first one, 'The Cuckoo's Calling', to delve into all the rest, including 'Lethal White', which will make it's debut sometime in 2020 according to IMDb. It wasn't until I finished 'Cuckoo' that I read the liner jacket and discovered that the name of author Robert Galbraith was a synonym for J.K. Rowling, who serves as executive producer for the TV series.",/review/rw6073855/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2017,myangel109,9," Every Detective needs a good coat
","I LOVE these books. I was very anxious about watching the show because I personally hate the Harry Potter adaptations. The casting was great especially Robin. I honestly thought they might have changed the ending from the book, it had me guessing (and I've read the book more than once). I have read mixed reviews about this show and I understand the criticism, however, I think it deserves a bigger audience. There are a few nitpicks I had, when I read the books I pictured Luther.. and Tom Burke seems to have stolen his coat from BBC props. ",/review/rw6073855/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2022,rich-mac,8," Quietly brilliant
",For my money Tom Burke and Holliday Grainger do a fine job of providing the focal point and anchor for these superb detective whodunnits penned by Galbraith aka. JK Rowling. I suppose it's fair to say that you'll either find chemistry between Strike and Robin (the leads) or you won't.,/review/rw6073855/?ref_=tt_urv

",I have just watched 'The Cuckoo's Calling'. This is a great take on the hard on his heels private investigator gets an opportunity story. JK Rowling's content is as well written as a John Grisham/Agatha Christie with the added frisson of cool London locations and culture. I particularly like the casting of Tom Bell as the rough-round-the-edges sleuth and the engaging Holliday Grainger as his ever so capable assistant; they are both so watchable. I look forward to the next series (and for any critics of this series yes I am perfectly happy to overlook any plot holes).,/review/rw6073855/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2022,Pairic,9," Dark Tale About Missing People
","Strike Series 5: Troubled Blood. Once again a multilayered case is investigated by Cormoran Strike and Robin Ellacott. Robin is still disentangling herself from a past relationship while Strike has his own family problems with both his adoptive family and his birth father. The case is about a woman who disappeared in 1974. She might have been the victim of a manipulative serial killer who still pulls strings from his prison cell. They find the diaries of a deceased policeman which suggest occult motives. Other rumours of Black Magic abound. Other relatives of missing people emerge, muddying the waters yet also providing more clues. Several potential culprits emerge. There are many flashbacks to 1974 and even earlier, we see characters when they are young and in old age. Many engaging odd characters even in small parts. Directed by Sue Tully and scripted by Tom Edge from the novel by by J. K. Rowling under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. 8.5/10.",/review/rw6073855/?ref_=tt_urv

","All I can say is watch it....I watched the first three episodes In one go it was that good.i was only going to watch one but it got me hooked immediately . The acting was brilliant,Tom Burke who I have to admit I've never seen before played a brilliant part,he was like a young modern day Columbo..The story line had you guessing from the start and there was a great twist at the end. 10 out of 10.

18 September 2017,Tweekums,8," An interesting new detective series from the pen of JK Rowling
","The first two stories in this series, based on books by JK Rowling, are nicely varied and manage to feel modern and rather traditional. The impressively named Cormoran Strike, his father was a rock star, is a fine lead character. He previously served in the army and lost a leg in Afghanistan and is now working as a private detective in London. We are introduced to him via his new, initially temporary, assistant Robin Ellacott. Their first case together sees them investigating the death of a supermodel; the authorities believe she killed herself but her brother, an old friend of Cormoran, believes she was murdered. In second case they are employed to find a woman's husband, a writer. He is soon found dead; killed in the brutal manner described in his latest book. This book is a thinly veiled attack on fellow novelists and others in the publishing world so there are no shortage of suspects.",/review/rw6073855/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2022,stevenmckinstry,3," Am I alone in not following the plot?
","I loved the previous series, but ""Troubled Blood"" was sadly just too difficult to follow. There seemed to be so many blind ending plot twists and too many names and characters. For example, they found a home movie film of the brutal gang murder of a blindfolded girl in the possessions of a deceased mentally deranged detective. Where did this come from, what did it contribute to the story and what did it have to do with the final solution of the case?",/review/rw6073855/?ref_=tt_urv
