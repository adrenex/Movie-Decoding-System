1 January 2023,A_Different_Drummer,7," two things to remember
","Two things need to be made clear off the top. First, Australia continues to be world-class in the production of series drama, and Black Snow is no exception. Two, Travis Fimmel is one of those rare actors whose breakout performance (as Ragnar) was so strong that he may be spending the rest of his career trying to prove that Vikings was no accident. In this production, he wears horn-rimmed glasses and has a number of quirks. However, as a successful ""cold case"" detective -- one who solves cases no one else can -- his boss cuts him a lot of slack. As expected, this gives him room to use his considerable skills to flesh out a character that keeps the attention for the full length of the series. The story is a police procedural -- something the Aussies excel at, check out MYSTERY ROAD -- that is sparsely directed, yet effective at maintaining the suspense. Recommended.

2 January 2023,gallagherkellie,9," Amazing
","I might be biased as I'm an Aussie, but I'm saying that I usually prefer British crime shows. This one however, lived up to expectations. I've been seeing ads for it for a while now and I was really hoping it wouldn't be a let down...and it wasn't.",/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,efd-10467,7," Okay but the over acting is too much at times
","An interesting backdrop and plot, Travis Fimmel acts his part well adding a touch of class that exposes some of the others.",/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,harril-586-26745,5," A not bad story.
","Hats on to the genius who created the annoying smashing drums motif throughout the first couple of episodes. Hopefully his/her music career in movies begins and ends here. Travis Fimmel brings star quality to a character quite unworthy of his talent. The only other actors not bringing a 'now I'm reading a script' performance are Brooke Satchwell, Anthony J Sharpe and Gulliver McGrath. This whodunnit show was definitely watchable but I found it necessary to suspend belief at the crummy acting so I could eventually find out who the murderer was. Unlike other series in this genre there were never any cliffhangers compelling the viewer to want more.... but hey I stuck with it till the end because of Cormack's intensely interesting back story.",/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,smithnumber,5," A lot going for it, but too much going against it.
","This series does a great job of showcasing the QLD locations. Unfortunately, it also showcases the limited acting abilities of most of the cast. Travis Fimmel is an interesting choice for the role of detective, but his American-style approach to acting, with all his mumbling and twitching, is very much out of place with the rest of the cast. It's like he's in another production altogether.",/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2023,kkeane-68234,9," Great Australian film making
",Loved Travis in this! My favourite of his work so far.,/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,lmrk5705,5," Interesting story, but .....
",Was very much looking forward to Black Snow. The story is interesting and the performances of the people set in 1990's flashbacks are great. There is also a killer 90's soundtrack. But there are two major issues I had with this mini series.,/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2023,Peekupz,7," Better than it looked like being
",I was fairly worried at the start. The first scenes of Izzy were as unsympathetically shot as possible. Then the introduction of Travis Fimmel's character had me thinking uh oh this is going to be over the top.,/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2023,Jemae,3," I kept waiting for something to happen
","This series sounds pretty good, however in my opinion, it's not very good.",/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2023,Movieguru1970,9," Well rounded, beautifully shot
","One of the more difficult things with regards to a story line with so many different character arcs is to keep each as interesting as the other. There wasn't a single time where I would shut off with different characters on screen; all interesting as the next. Travis Fimmel was exceptional along with his supportive actors and actresses. Even the younger versions of the characters were extremely good, which can be difficult to pull off. The only problem I can really think of is that about a few eps in, the suspect pool isn't necessarily the entire cast - however the killer is still extremely difficult to predict due to the amazing drip fed style of writing. All in all a very well done series with an absolute stellar sound design (and tracks).",/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,thom-gillespie,9," Absolutely beautiful mystery
","Everything about Black Snow rings true: the dialog, the acting and the setting, which means if you are looking for Jason Bourne or Jack Ryan go elsewhere. But, if you start this series all you will want is more story and watching will quickly become binging to see what story is just over the hill or on the other side of the sugar cane field. This is a cold case drama set in Australia among native peoples which unfold in the present about the past. The screen loves all the actors but two stand out: Travis Fimmel, as Cormac, the very slow talking and walking cold case detective driven by other demons, and Talijah Blackman-Corowa as Izabel Baker, the victim. Talijah Blackman-Corowa as the young Izzy owns the eye of the camera with her acting skill and beauty.",/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,rory-83461,8," When you look passed the acting
","I gave this show an 8 out of 10 because it was well scripted and for an Australian show very intriguing. The acting in most of the young cast is appalling tho, like cringe worthy. Surely they could have found better actors than that. Some plots in the show not concluded. So I'm assuming there will be another season if this rates well enough. Lead actor was great tho, and so were some of the other older cast. Hopefully next season they bring in some bigger budget actors. All in all a good Aussie show that I hope people get around to support the Australian film industry.",/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,paulp-29549,2," Slow, poor acting, amateur script.
","After reading the positive reviews, I thought this might be the Aussie show to change my view that they are generally pretentious and over-dramatised with ""odd"" music Call me old fashioned but just get on with telling a good story please, rather than compensate with poor attempts at artistic flair. Unfortunately, I was again disappointed - Black Snow was so slow moving that it was difficult to maintain interest and this was not helped by the mediocre script, shallow characters and poor acting. And, yes, there was a fair amount of offputting background music (I am not referring to the indigenous songs here). I'm an Aussie btw.",/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2023,don_juan,8," Takes you on a journey in solving the crime
","Very good show. Some things about it left me scratching my head (e.g. Why the dead person's niece was so angry when she wasn't even born at the time, so never knew her). Among a couple of other things, like a character throwing out the race card, when I didn't even think it was the case.",/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,Stephanie4040,1," Other than Travis Fimmel - bad acting
","Travis Fimmel is always going to be fantastic but everyone else can't act well enough to even be on neighbours. Utterly awful! It's like they are reading off a script right in front of them. Considering Australia has produced some of the world's best actors, the casting in this show is atrocious. The characters also very stereotypically Aussie - I really wish that writers would get past writing characters that are poor, stupid, and bogan and stop trying to be arty and mysterious- Australian writers are not very good at it. It's infuriating. The music and background in the first couple of episodes was bloody awful - amateur hour. I honestly don't know what favours Travis Fimmel owed which led him to be in this show, but he really needs to go back to the UK and act in stuff worthy of his talents - as stuff like this is going to end his career.",/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,mformoviesandmore,4," Woke melodrama
",Fimmel plays a policeman in much the same way he played a Viking - and it looks silly and unprofessional. Perhaps that is fine for the intended audience.,/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2023,graham-98732,1," You should start as you intend to continue
","Where do I begin? Surely in a country which has produced a long procession of quality actors from Errol Flynn to Cate Blanchett we could find someone who can deliver a line with conviction and believability! Wooden, lacking in depth and emotion. I struggled through the opening scenes and finally gave up. A shout out to all those in the art department, what weed were you on? A 000 call on a public phone was a free call. Struggling with a coin is a big fail on research. Then opening a Time Capsule which looks like it has been buried for 25 minutes rather than 25 years was another lapse in professionalism. I hope I'm wrong when I look at the casting and see the woke hand of inclusivity, and diversity. What sounded like a really good story was ruined in the first 15 minutes. Eventually (I hope) common sense will prevail and actors will be selected on merit and will deliver a solid and believable performance.",/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2023,wagdy-07651,10," Entertaining
","Black Snow must surely considered as one of the braver exercises in TV drama in recent years. I enjoyed it alot. It's a well-constructed genre piece, but it's also pretty familiar. Where it really gets interesting is in the way of writting has interwoven aspects of the area's shameful history into the narrative - specifically, the trade in Pacific Islanders who were brought to Australia from the mid 19th century to work in the cane fields. It was called blackbirding, it was in large part a form of slavery, and more than 60,000 people were brought here that way. It most reminds me of in this respect is HBO's Sharp Objects. Not quite the same yet alot similar in certain aspects.",/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,yrgcc,1," A mess
","The opening scenes set up Travis Fimmel's character Cormack as 'soft on the inside but hard on the outside' but the attempt falls flat, setting up confusion, unconnected to the series at large.",/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,philip-03318,6," Bad acting ruins potential.
","I'm sorry, but the bad / over acting just destroys this show. I'm talking about the support cast. How did the crew not pick up on this during production. This must have been obvious and surly it was pointed out but obviously they must have been too deep into filming to address. It's not just the odd scene but the continuity of bad acting that becomes bigger than the story. There is absolutely no heart in the delivery of these lines by what must be very inexperienced actors.",/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,yasminfrazzetto-56978,1," Worst acting I think I've ever seen
","Was this a high school project? Storyline could have been reasonably good, but the acting was atrocious by the majority of the cast. Absolutely cringeworthy. Even the lead actor produced a very wooden performance. Don't get me started on the junior cast- surely there is more talent out there?!",/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2023,carmensupone,3," Try hard
","Considering how good australians are at telling stories, this show misses the mark. So slow and performance by main actor playing detective is a poor mans try hard Bill Pullman in The Sinner - even down to his look. Mystery Road is 10 times the acting and story compared with this show... Stan are trying to cash in on the success of Mystery Road: Origin... And yes i watched til the end. I was hoping that it would get better only to be let down! Wish I had turned it off as I will never get that time back...Only saving grace is that it highlights that australia had a LOT of slavery in our not so distant past.",/review/rw8776253/?ref_=tt_urv
