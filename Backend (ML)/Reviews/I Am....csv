12 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," King Arthur
","Let's be clear: this contains very few aspects of the actual Arthur legend. They probably should have just gone for a wacky original medieval fantasy film instead. That being said, I didn't expect Ritchie's style to work this well here. And he hasn't been this crazy since Snatch. Some montages are so breathless, fast and innovative as far as editing and soundtrack go, it's a pleasure. Sure, the plot follows the genre conventions more or less, and the finale is a bit heavy on CGI. On the other hand the assassination attempt sequence is fantastic and the portrayal of magic pretty cool. Hell, I had fun with this.",/review/rw3706005/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2017,TxMike,," One King Arthur origin story, from small child to King.

22 May 2017,The-Sarkologist,9," King Arthur- Guy Ritchie Style
","In some what I'm not all that surprised that Guy Ritchie decided to do a King Arthur film, though I wasn't quite expecting it to be a film done in Guy Ritchie style. In a sense it sort of comes across as being his typical dark and gritty film yet in another sense it is also very much an heroic fantasy. In a way it is a shame that the film flopped the way it did because it was actually a pretty enjoyable film, and I certainly quite like Ritchie's style of directing. Okay, a part of me didn't quite get the humour of the piece, particularly since we had a similar style in all of his films. However, what we do need to remember is the Ritchies style has always been very gritty, and King Arthur is no exception.",/review/rw3706005/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2017,MichaelNontonMulu,8," An Entertaining Adaptation of King Arthur & Excalibur Sword
","Wow, this is one heck of a movie. I was overwhelmed with some of the scenes, especially the fighting scenes in the beginning, the middle and also in the end. There was a wonderful opening credit scene which I felt was very awesome. It lasted probably only 5 minutes but it really impressed me. And, the movie also had some brief parts which were fun to see, like the scene when Arthur was telling the story about the Vikings. Out of the whole fighting scenes, the one that I enjoyed most was in the middle which I felt was rather breathtaking and having an ultimate amazing ending.",/review/rw3706005/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2017,ngkos,8," Game of Thrones + Lord of the Rings story lines with Snatch + Lock Stock dialogues and editing
","Will keep it short and simple. If you don't get/understand the (British) humour (i.e you don't think the jokes are funny), dialogue and fast ""flashbacky"" editing style presented in Lock Stock and Snatch, you will hate this movie. Easy as that. For us who understand what constitutes a Ritchie movie will be more likely than not, like the movie.",/review/rw3706005/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2019,Leofwine_draca,3," A real mess
","KING ARTHUR: LEGEND OF THE SWORD is another example of Hollywood's modern obsession with CGI-enhanced action spectacle, forgetting in the meantime to include anything like narrative coherence, character depth, the usual staples of filmmaking. This one starts off with big, brawling, random fantasy sequence, but who cares when you don't know the characters or indeed know what's going on?",/review/rw3706005/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2018,deloudelouvain,4," Not the type of movie Guy Ritchie should make.
","Guy Ritchie should stick at what he's best at. Movies like Snatch, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels or Rocknrolla. Those are the style movies he should make and not one about King Arthur. King Arthur: Legend Of The Sword is a big budget movie, no doubt about that, with alot of effort with the special effects, CGI's, costumes and extras. But the problem is the story and the acting. The story is just weak, and sometimes makes no sense at all. Even with all the special effects, that are nicely shot, it still remains boring to watch. The acting was just mediocre, it looked like they were reading their script all the time. Charlie Hunnam can only play Jax, his character in Sons Of Anarchy. I was literally waiting for him to step on his bike and drive away. I don't know what women see in him, his acting is very monotone and average. The acting of Astrid Berg√®s-Frisbey playing The Mage was also just mediocre. It looked all fake, just like the whole story. With such a high budget you would expect quality, but besides the filming and the special effects it's just below average. Disappointment!",/review/rw3706005/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2017,champjohnson29,9," A Pleasant Surprise!
","The first trailer had me very excited to see this film. The genre is right up my alley. But negative reviews made me think twice and I was just going to wait for it to go to redbox or watch it online (just being honest LOL). But then I started seeing positive reviews and I knew I had to form my opinion. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised and glad I went because I really enjoyed this film from beginning to end. IT's not without it's flaws but will get into that in a minute.",/review/rw3706005/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2017,dave-mcclain,10," a creative and nearly perfect interpretation of Arthurian legend
","At its most basic, the story of King Arthur boils down to this: He was a fabled king of Britain in the late 5th and early 6th centuries, whose legend has grown and expanded over the millennium and a half since. Historically, we don't know for sure whether Arthur actually existed, but literarily, not only can his existence not be denied, but it cannot be avoided. Tales of the great king and his court, called Camelot, his wife Guinevere, his right-hand-man Lancelot and the rest of the Knights of the Round Table, his wizard Merlin and Arthur's magical sword Excalibur have been told, retold, changed and embellished over the centuries by books, stage productions and other media, including, of course, television and film. A countless number of TV shows and movies have referenced the legends and many have used ""Excalibur"", ""Camelot"" and, of course, ""Arthur"" in their titles. In 2017, auteur Guy Ritchie gets into the game with the action-adventure-drama ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"" (PG-13, 2:06), the first in a series of films reinterpreting the Arthurian legend with Ritchie's signature creative flare for reinvention. In launching a new franchise, Ritchie gives us an origin story which expounds upon the age-old tales, introduces new elements and characters and combines other stories and legends into a cohesive whole.",/review/rw3706005/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2017,bobzzy,10," Forget about king Arthur
",Few months ago when I watched the trailer and considering the fact that Guy Ritchie is directing this I knew one thing for sure - this movie will NOT BE a King Arthur story. What happens here is that Ritchie took the concept of the King Arthur and Excalibur's myths and made a movie out of them in a way only he can (reference - Sherlock Holmes).,/review/rw3706005/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2021,masonsaul,8," Great fantasy adventure
","King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a great fantasy adventure that's stylish and funny with a fresh and interesting take on the King Arthur mythos. Charlie Hunnam gives an incredible and extremely charismatic lead performance. Djimon Hounsou and Aidan Gillen are both great and Jude Law is a terrific villiain. Guy Richtie's direction is fantastic, combining his classic trademarks and style with a grander scale. The music by Daniel Pemberton is amazing. However, it's brought down by some poor CG but it's impressive for the most part.",/review/rw3706005/?ref_=tt_urv

28 May 2017,soundoflight,3," All style, no substance
",Perhaps this movie means more to people who have some kind of attachment or attraction to the King Arthur legend already. That's the only way I can explain how so many people are giving this movie gushing 10/10 reviews.,/review/rw3706005/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2017,Ramascreen,6," It's King Arthur through Guy Ritchie's filters
","The biggest problem with #KingArthur #LegendOfTheSword is that it puts more emphasis on trying to be a Guy Ritchie superhero film than it is about King Arthur. I understand that mythically, Arthur's sword supposedly bears powers of its own, but this films makes its effects work the same way spinach boosts Popeye's strength. Another problem is that instead of watching a movie, some of the time it feels more like you're watching ""Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor"" video game walkthrough.",/review/rw3706005/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2017,TheLittleSongbird,6," Less than legendary, still better than expected
","'King Arthur: Legend of the Sword' left me somewhat on the fence. It is much better than some critics have said, being nowhere near among the worst films seen so far this year, but it to me doesn't quite warrant the vehement defence it's garnered too.",/review/rw3706005/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2017,ayoreinf,8," Is this the beginning of a new Hollywood franchise?
","I'm not going to dwell long over the plot itself. After the Audacity of Antoine Fuqua and co at 2004, when they declared their pseudo historic version is ""The Untold True Story That Inspired The Legend"", none can complain. King Arthur is obviously the biggest English myth, and has more than one version, so it does allow for some literary liberty regarding the plot line. This one took it very far, Not as far as the 2004 version did, but since they never claimed to present us with the true version, how can we complain.",/review/rw3706005/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2017,Deloron,7," Underestimated
","This Movie was so much better than everybody told me. The fight scenes, the shots and the music was gorgeous. I really don't now why this movie receives that much hate. For me it was just Guy Ritchie at his best. Give this movie a try, its worth it! No joke, it was the best movie in this year, just stunning and epic. I loved it and i think that a lot of people will love this movie too! 7/10.",/review/rw3706005/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hadn't seen a trailer or heard much about this, aside from the face David Beckham was in it (he had like two lines and they were fine so not sure whey everyone was so fussed about that).

24 May 2017,SquigglyCrunch,9," A Modern Film Style Placed Over a Fantastical Setting Somehow Works Out
","King Arthur: Legend of the Sword is a retelling of the story of King Arthur, unsurprisingly. It follows a young boy as he is separated from his parents and raised outside of his kingdom. When he pulls the king's sword from the stone, the current king learns who he is and sets out to stop him from claiming his place as king. ",/review/rw3706005/?ref_=tt_urv

","The legend of King Arthur and Excalibur has been been told many times by the cinema and television. John Boorman's ""Excalibur"" and Walt Disney ""The Sword in the Stone"" are certainly among my favorite versions of this legend. The versions that I have seen have different stories but the storyline are similar; therefore, most of the worldwide viewers have a similar view of King Arthur and Excalibur.

26 May 2017,M_Exchange,2," Absolutely god awful
","I made it through twenty minutes. It has possibly the worst video editing that I've ever seen in a film in my life. I didn't even know what I was watching sometimes during those twenty minutes. They cut from one meaningless thing to another like it was vital to a story element when, in fact, it was just a supposedly cool ""Suicide Squad"" style sequence. It also had two video montages during those twenty minutes, which was intolerable, partly because they were done in the same frantic and headache-inducing manner that the regular cuts were shot in.",/review/rw3706005/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2017,shawthingproductions,1," A disappointing mess.

12 May 2017,mohamed-elbahnasawy,9," The reviews does this movie no justice. it doesn't have to be the old story with no creativity.
","I believe this movie would have been a master piece of a series due to 
 the huge amount of event packed into 2 hours, but this is no criticism 
 on how great the movie is and how the numbers of this site doesn't do 
 it justice. 90% of the negative reviews comes under the lame excuse of 
 ""that's not how king Arthur is supposed to be"". If you actually want a 
 movie where you know everything already starting from the story, 
 characters and twists then I'd call you the stupidest ever. Yes this 
 isn't your typical king Arthur movie, and that adds even more to the 
 awesomeness of it.amnt saying the movie is flawless, no movie is, but 
 it was great starting from acting, animation, story, music tracks, 
 everything. Again would have been better off it was a series and I 
 hope there would be a sequel including the knights of the round table, 
 sure Lancelot and some dramatic betrayal or even Arthur's betrayal 
 himself to the kingdom.",/review/rw3706005/?ref_=tt_urv
