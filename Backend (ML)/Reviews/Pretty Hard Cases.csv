23 April 2022,Benslie,10," A relatable series for everybody
","As a fan of the, ""Heartstopper"" comic I can easily say this show is for those who have and haven't heard of this series and just want a feel-good show to watch.",/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv

23 April 2022,agentsofsword,10," Great and Fun Coming of Age show
",I definitely didn't watch the trailers I just watched it when it came out and it was PERFECT.,/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2022,thiagosblancos,9," I couldn't stop smiling...!
","Hi, gay here! To all of us, children from the 90s who went through hell in school this still seems like twilight zone or something but it is coming, finally teachers are paying attention, and that behaviour is not accepted, not ignored (aka accepted) anymore.",/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2022,star_hazard,9," LGBTQ teen version of feelgood hallmark shows but with more sweetness
",I never read the graphic novel so I watched this blind. I only knew that this was LGBTQ themed.,/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2022,jammerknight,10," A show for the Next Generation... which I wish my generation had
","'Hi'
So I love heartstopper. When I heard we were getting this Netflix series I was so excited and the show didn't let me down.",/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2022,chatwithmichaelmac,10," Finally-an intelligent portrayal of teen LGBTQ sexuality
","A welcome series witch pretty much scores top marks in every field. Outstanding acting, wonderful script and clever cinematography bring this tale of coming out to the screen with great style and intelligence. Possibly the first clever portrayal of bi-sexuality dealt with respectfully and realistically.",/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2022,keshavptl,10," Perfection! So feel-good!
","This series is so good! I loved how the actors are actually teens and the plot is so realistic! No over drama at all, no negativity, just how it should be. The cast and characters are amazing. Just so well implementation - it's a charming feel-good series. Also I liked how Charlie and Nick are so understanding, they are just adorable! Must watch and keep your homophobia at bay.",/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2022,atomeckova,10," screaming crying
",It's so fricking good to see positive representation of lgbtq relationships that i cried like ten times. Also nick'a journey with bisexuality was so well explained and just overall chefs kiss we love when bisexuality is presented correctly.,/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2022,REVVINCENT,10," Over the top!
","It is very seldom I give a *10 to any movie. ""Heartstopper"" is definitely a 10.",/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv

",Loved it. Loved it. Loved it.,/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2022,sollyharv,8," Sweet!
","This is so cute I'm gonna throw up. Would highly recommend the webcomic too, it makes me want to die. Also reading it helped me to come out. ALSO SURPRISE OLIVIA COLMAN. OLIVIA COLMAN LIKES PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN MAKES THE RUGBY BOY REALISE HE'S BISEXUAL W H A T.",/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2022,johannes2000-1,10," Endearing and close to perfection!
","What a wonderful experience this is: positive, endearing and uplifting! It's really a relief to see that in the nowadays landscape of high school series chockfull of murders, sexual harassments, gay bashings and what more, a series like this not only can exist, but (in view of the high rating here on IMDb) actually touches the heart of so many people.",/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2022,alrightlove3,10," Too adorable...too wholesome... it's not for you.
","I'm a 32 year old gay guy who remembers only too well how awful my teenage years were in the closet at school. When I started watching this series I found it a bit offensive. Charlie seems to have it so easy. He's got supportive friends, he's having a fling with a 'straight' boy. Then nick enters the story and is also interested in him. I felt like this was some sort of fairytale in comparison to what I went through and thought it was offensive to suggest that it could be so easy to be a gay teenager.",/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,kigaiyuuto,10," WOWW This Milkshake is definitely better than yours
","Damn right it's better than yours. EASILY the best new Netflix show releasing this week beating out Russian Doll, Heirs to the Land, Hold Tight, The Marked Heart, and Yakamoz S245. It didn't have the usual TV cliche of slow pacing and then cliffhanger ending and this makes me give it a 10/10.",/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2022,nastasia_g8,9," SIMPLY, LOVED IT!!
","I am not a mother and I don't know if I'll ever be one but if any parents out there are reading this please support and love your children no matter what!! When a person is happy and loved does it really matter who they love?? And PLEASE teach your children that too. This era of hatred of anyone and anything different must end and who better to do it if not us? Hatred is not hereditary but unfortunately it can be passed on from generation to generation! And by the way, even if I don't like labeling myself I am going to make an exception this time and say that I am straight,only doing so not because I belong to LBGTQ community, I don't, but because I am a
teacher. And love can be taught too.",/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv

27 April 2022,brettgriggs-46299,10," Wonderful
",Just lovely and yes a little corny but we need more series like this. All the hater reviews can get stuffed. Todays youth are tomorrow's leaders. ðŸŒˆ ðŸ˜€ Well done Netflix.,/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,cammic,9," A beauty told story
",It's not often that a gay story is told so well but this is one of those times. Growing up confused about your sexuality and dealing with coming out ... even today....is not always easy for everyone. The main characters are wonderful in this series. I think the English always handle these stories genuinely!,/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv

","Comparisons with 'Beautiful Thing',(another fine film),are irresistable.",/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2022,Raja79,10," Wholesome Show!
","This is one of Netflix's better recent shows, and it feels so wholesome and relaxing. I love how it uses those animated effects to enhance the scenes, since that really adds a wholesome vibe to it.",/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2022,youssefmourid,10," a beautiful story !
",Netflix did it again. I watched it in 3 hours . It's a beautifully and an emotional coming of age stories. Highly recommended ! I hope there will be a second season even if i doubt it because it had a wonderful ending .,/review/rw8098540/?ref_=tt_urv
