27 April 2017,Sleepin_Dragon,10," This has become the Series of the year (again)
","A very difficult show to review, overall I'd give Series 1 an 8/10, a very good show, strong characters, intrigue etc, however something happens in the second series and has continued through to the present day, since that very first episode of Series 2 (or in fairness Part 6 of the opening Series) Line of Duty has become the best thing on the box. The cast work together in a way that you don't often see in many shows, the degree of realism each of them injects makes the show feel very real. Dunbar, Compston, McClure, Parkinson etc are all utterly phenomenal, I think though, it was the performance of Keeley Hawes as Lindsay Denton that increased my interest in the show, she was utterly amazing.",/review/rw3448316/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2015,BeneCumb,9," Strong British series, in the Scandinavian style
","In recent years, I have generally ""moved on"" from Poirot-Wallander type of series (usually 1 episode - 1 solved case) to more sophisticated and intertwined series where events take place in parallel and with flashbacks, and for full comprehension, one should watch all the episodes in sequence. It take more time and dedication, but there are more versatile characters and more complex situations where one can ponder on and over more intensely.",/review/rw3448316/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2016,robin_should,8," Another show which has not enough recognition
","Once again I stumbled onto this show by accident. Thank goodness. I find British police drama much more intense than the run of the mill American shows. This one is no exception. The acting is very convincing on all accounts. You think in the beginning how can this ""kid"" be a good main character. He then proves you very wrong and you see that his conviction to the case is what makes him compelling to watch. All the main players are only too human. The stories all have their own twists and turns, keeping you on your toes all the time. Making this show fascinating to watch. I admit there was an awful lot of binge watching as I couldn't leave the plot at the end of each episode. ",/review/rw3448316/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2017,peterrichboy,10," Superb crime drama
","I have been a huge fan of this show since season one and it's a rare feet when seasons 2 and 3 surpass the quality of the first. It draws you in and keeps you gripped never failing to end each episode on a cliffhanger which makes you desperate to see the next instalment. The cast is UK A list Aidrian DUnbar, Vicky Mclure, Martin Compson and Keely Hawes who gives the performance of her career in seasons 2 and 3. I'm not one to give plots away, but if your a fan of quality crime drama or Nordic noir I cannot recommend this show highly enough. Just one note of caution if your planning DVD series binge then expect some late nights!",/review/rw3448316/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2017,sas2014,10," en captivating, best of the British film making
","I am a crime story lover and by far this is the best (even better than scandi crime Bridges and killing)I have ever seen. The characters are complex and specially Tandi N in series 3, is the most clever criminal police woman ever! I cant say enough to justify watching this best of the British film making, so 100% try",/review/rw3448316/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2014,pk1873,10," First season good, second season unmissable
","I watched series one last year, it was a good cop show, it came at things from a slightly different angle as it had the anti-corruption unit (internal affairs) as the 'good guys', so my rating was a solid 7.5... i enjoyed it enough to tune in to the second series which as i write this has one episode left to air and i have to say it has been TV at it's very best, from the opening few minutes it had me glued eagerly anticipating each weeks new developments, no spoilers here i only recommend you watch it for yourself to experience the shocks, the thrills and the suspense which it has in abundance, the casting of Keeley Hawes as DI Lindsay Denton was a masterstroke, the character is complex to say the least and she will trigger every emotion you have in your arsenal. Superb character acting, it really is. My revised rating overall is 9/10 but i'd give series two 10/10 after 5 of the 6 episodes...Well I thought I'd return for an update as I love this show so much now.. Needless to say season 2 finished as it had began.. sheer class and a great example of how good TV is right now.. Keeley Hawes we salute you.. now we are 1 ep into season 3 and Jed Mercurio has done it again the season opener quite literally blew me away I was so looking forward to it and it was like welcoming an old friend back into my life.. I can't wait to see where the show is taking me next",/review/rw3448316/?ref_=tt_urv

","Yes, the final episode of series six of ""Line of Duty"" was, in a way, disappointing, because we didn't really get all the answers and we didn't get ""justice"" for everyone. ""Chicago P. D."" it's not.",/review/rw3448316/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2016,prosper1,9," brilliant
","This is a brilliant series. It is what I expect from the BBC, rather than the dreg they've been commissioning lately. The writing is tight and unrelenting in keeping upping the ante. It is complex, that is, we have great character arcs, as well as story arcs. The casting is so sublime that you would have to restrain yourself meeting those villains on the street and let's face it, drama is most often successful due to great villains. Shows like this, the tunnel, undercover, etc., make it nearly impossible to watch network TV in Amerika, where it is the same thing over and over again. The conclusion and arrest is telegraphed usually in the 1st five minutes. Kudos, and I don't give these freely, to the team that created this show. I look forward to more with baited breath. Bravo",/review/rw3448316/?ref_=tt_urv

","Probably too well done to be a smash hit. But this is surely the best detective show ever produced. The incredible twists and turns in the plot line will keep you glued to your screen. Absolutely brilliant script writing supported by perfect casting and acting.Simply, as good as it gets.",/review/rw3448316/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2017,snowyprecipice,10," Amazing piece of work
","This has been an amazing series so far (just finished season 3). It feels so real, so gritty. The characters are so nuanced and complex; they have good and bad sides to them, and you can't help but root for them at different points (both the 'bad' and 'good'). ",/review/rw3448316/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2012,paul2001sw-1,7," Straight down the line
","Last year the BBC brought us the superb, slightly strange police thriller 'The Shadow Line'; this year, the rather more conventional 'The Line of Duty' has aired. Aspects of this programme are quite good, although it never feels exactly fresh. Anti-corruption units, and undercover agents, have been on our screen before ('Between the Lines' - there's clearly something magnetic about that word 'line' and 'The Ghost Squad') - and some of the conspiracy elements seem both far fetched and perfunctory. Perhaps the greatest problem is that Lennie James' protagonist is a hard man to connect with: an almost-clean copper brought down by a bad friend, he remains a hard man to like, and while he appears to be driven by his own private sense of ethics, this moral code seems completely self-centred - he's torn when he fails to live up to his own expectations of himself, but it's hard to see why we should care. And the portrait of feral kids on the local housing estate seems both lazy, and again relatively loosely connected to the more serious crime in the background - if you're looking for the forensic detail of 'The Wire', you won't find it here. None of this actually makes for a bad series - it does all the standard things you expect a show of this sort to do reasonably well, but it doesn't add much you won't have seen before.",/review/rw3448316/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2012,Lejink,8," Internal affair
","Covering similar territory to the BBC's great ""Between The Lines"" series of the 90's, this five part-series was essential viewing in our household. Gripping from the start, it never really let go and even if the conclusion was slightly unsatisfactory in my eyes, in that pretty much all the bad guys got away with it and justice wasn't seen to be done, but in terms of plotting and character development, it was riveting throughout.",/review/rw3448316/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2014,face-819-933726,9," Like The Wire meeting the Shield head on with British real life issues up in lights.
","I am really Enjoying this series. There have not been many really smart police dramas no mater what country you compare this with though you will find that this is going to meet all other crime dramas head on and without trying to protect itself, or the sensibilities of the people. They are holding up a sign to the world with this show, and written in bold is that they know they are broken, but they have not been beaten. What you liked about The Wire, and The Shield, the truth, and heart of those shows is here, and shining like a beacon. You will be on board in the first episode, and surely you will want more. There have been a couple of nice shows like By Any Means lately, and deep dramas like Broadchurch, however what you get from Line of Duty is the real world and the real problems that can derail a really good image that is only ever the fragile image that people want to see. It's only when you dig down to the veins, and fibers that you really see the whole story.",/review/rw3448316/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2015,caitlinbiwer,9," A series to watch
","Line of duty is an exceptional police drama. My parents first found it on BBC2 which I find unusual by the fact that it is hidden amongst a less popular channel. Furthermore, the acting is brilliant and you'll be on the edge of your seat at the end of every episode - it is indeed one of the best police series I have watched yet. I suppose it could be down to the fact that it is very unique, in which the producers have found a huge gap within the crime genre of focusing upon AC12 which is an anti-corruption unit. This means that the entire series one and two focus upon entirely different story lines but withholds the same cast in both the first and second series. All I can say is it is a must-see and you will be hooked from the first episode - and I cannot wait till the third season!",/review/rw3448316/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2019,arab-61505,10," Probably the best drama the BBC has ever done
","Can't believe it hasn't had more awards or recognition. Every series is as good as the last. Blows the likes of The Bodyguard and Killing Eve out the water. The acting is so much better with Keeley Hawes (good in The Bodyguard but brilliant in this), Vicky McClure, and Thandie Newton (series 4) all particularly magnificent. Can't wait for series 6!",/review/rw3448316/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2014,baronetdedlock,9," Excellent Series!
","This is a review of both Season 1 & 2 of this wonderful British series. Although there is a different story line in each of the seasons, there is some continuity in the important characters: the actors Martin Compston, Adrian Dunbar and Vicki McClure, among others, appear in both seasons as the same characters. The story in each season deals with a conflict within a police department between the regular forces and the internal affairs or ""anti-corruption"" unit. Thematically, it is concerned with the moral ambiguities that arise when policemen investigate their own. I think this is one of the best British police procedurals that I have seen. The acting and the writing are uniformly excellent, and I hope it comes back for a third season.",/review/rw3448316/?ref_=tt_urv

21 September 2021,lotekguy-1,8," Lennie James got screwed
","I devoured the first three seasons in two days. The scripts are intelligent, intense, and simultaneously wonderfully and appallingly cynical about corruption within police departments and other phases of law enforcement. The dialog is brilliantly written, making long interrogation scenes bristle with tension, never seeming overly talky. The series is ideal for binge watching, since seeing each season of episodes back-to-back helps keep the complicated plotlines sorted.",/review/rw3448316/?ref_=tt_urv

","My wife, no fan of cop shows as such, was knocked out by this UK police procedural, as was I. Showrunner Jed Mercurio knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men, and for five seasons now his dauntless AC-12 (for anticorruption) unit has been hunting down a ring of ""bent coppers"" and their black-clad enforcers (""balaclava men"") in an unidentified city in the English Midlands (sometimes played by Belfast, btw). Plots are intricate, just this side of bewildering at times, and cases take up at least an entire season.",/review/rw3448316/?ref_=tt_urv
