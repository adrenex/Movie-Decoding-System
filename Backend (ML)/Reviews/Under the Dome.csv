10 March 2005,vertigo_14,7," Come out, come out, wherever you are. (spoilers)
","You might initially be reluctant to give 'The Glass House' a try if you've been turned off by many recent ""thrillers"" as they often have been disappointingly by the book. This is your eerie psychotic chase thriller similar to movies like 'Pacific Heights' and 'Unlawful Entry.' And, though it does play by the rules (unforutnately), there is something about it that makes it more entertaining than the recent dismal fare (not that Pacific Heights wasn't highly entertaining).",/review/rw2847855/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,6," Not the best, but an OK thriller
","Having seen many thrillers, most of them being formulaic, I was somewhat excited to see this one, since it has a pretty good cast; Stellan Skarsgård, Leelee Sobieski & Diane Lane. The plot does, admittedly have some holes, but these newer thrillers are rarely(read: never) perfect. All things considered, it wasn't a disappointment, as I didn't have that high expectations. The plot is OK, fairly see-through and obvious though, but it does have some twists that I(even though I may be alone on this) wasn't expecting. The acting isn't anything special, but at least Skarsgård and Sobieski both pull of decent performances. The characters are reasonably well-written, none of them come off as one-dimensional stereotypes, even though some of them, in all honesty, more or less are. The script is fairly well-written, though it does have its share of cliches, but most films do, anyway. All in all, a fair addition to the thriller genre, nothing that will stay in your mind for a long while after seeing it. It will, however, most likely keep your interest for the duration of the film, and keep you entertained, too. I recommend it to fans of thrillers, it would help to be a fan of at least one of the actors, and it doesn't hurt to have reasonably low standards or expectations. 6/10",/review/rw2847855/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2010,lastliberal,6," Get this straight, Ruby... you and Rhett... are mine.

12 August 2002,SamRag,7," Watched it because my wife demanded it!
","I was surprised by this one, after having read some of the comments about it.  My wife had insisted on several occasions to rent it, but I had managed to avoid it until now.  The reason being that I'm not a great fan of startle-you-scenes' movies, where story line comes second to all possible means to startle the audience out of their shoes (which I believe is a the wrong way in creating good horror/thriller action movies).  The Glass House is however not one of these, and I suspect that is one of the reason some people have given it slack reviews.  Here they seem to keep to more realistic theme, with characters re-acting in intelligent manner, instead of some idiots you often see in horror/thriller films.  The interesting thing was that the girl in the movie suspected from the start that something was wrong, and tried to solve the situation.  The authorities became part of the picture from the start, instead of the usual stupidity that someone evil' resides in position of authority, denying the victim any help.  The Glass couple were a bit unusual, though not overdoing it, and we can follow how they slip into their own nightmarish madness.  Especially good was the scene were Mr. Glass is asking for a loan at a bank, displaying how, in fact, he was just a regular man.  So all in all, this was just enough tension, in rather realistic environment, with surprisingly good acting all around. 7/10",/review/rw2847855/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2011,sddavis63,5," Generally Predictable Stuff
","On the whole, this is a fairly predictable suspense/thriller with the expected twists and turns thrown in to try to throw the viewer off and keep us guessing, but in reality there was really only one plot point that I was really guessing about (revolving around the estate lawyer and where and to whom his loyalties really were) and that particular plot point wasn't really at the heart of the story. The movie introduces Ruby (Leelee Sobieski) as a bit of a troubled kid, whose troubles become much more complicated when her parents are killed in a car accident, and she and her brother are sent to live with the Glass family - friends of their parents (played by Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane.) And, yes, the Glasses live in a house that seems to have a lot of glass - too cute by a longshot.",/review/rw2847855/?ref_=tt_urv

","I apologize for the pun, I could not resist myself. This film was recommended to me by a friend, and I had never heard of it, so I could not really say what I was expecting. What I received though was a smart, intense, fun, excellently executed thriller with wonderful performances that entertains from beginning to end.",/review/rw2847855/?ref_=tt_urv

27 July 2007,disdressed12,8," pretty good suspense thriller
","i enjoyed this movie.it has suspense,action,drama,and decent acting.it has a pretty dark tone to it,which i liked.while it have the same high octane adrenaline rush of ""Joy Ride"" which also starred Leelee Sobieski and also came out the same year,it's still pretty good in its own right.there's more of a slow build up to tension in this movie.i also think this movie demands a bit mote of its actors,especially for the the quiet dramatic moments.the cast acquit themselves fairly well here.the movie is fairly well written,though not wholly original(but there are some original elements to it)for me ""The Glass House"" is an 8/10",/review/rw2847855/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2007,ivo-cobra8,10," An Oscar for Leelee Sobieski
","The Glass House is probably the best thriller i'ever see.Leelee Sobieski is'the real actress and she deserve an Oscar for her role.She plays really convince,and she is'the real convince good actress.I'don't know how someone like Cathrine-Zeta Jones gets an Oscar she was never convince in her roles and she is not really good actress.This movie and the actress deserve an Oscar.The story begins when Ruby and Rhett parents die's in the car accident,The Glass married couple takes to their custody in their home,first seas to be normal family but later Ruby find's out that is is only illusion,the Glasse's wont's them dead, because Terry Glass is in deb with he's money so he wont's them to kill, so that he will get the money and pay he's play debs.He's wife is a doctor and a junkie,when Ruby find's out what the Glasse's are really intentions are,she has to fight for her and her youngest brother's life.The Glass House is probably the best thriller,too bad that they don't make more thriller's like this one.",/review/rw2847855/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2013,BA_Harrison,5," Sobieski just about makes it worthwhile...
","As much as I like me some Sobieski, especially when wearing a bikini as she does here, I cannot recommend The Glass House as anything other than a mildly entertaining yet instantly forgettable piece of trash; it certainly doesn't work as a taut psychological thriller as intended, the far-fetched nature of the scenario draining any tension from proceedings.",/review/rw2847855/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2014,Leofwine_draca,4," Silly thriller
","THE GLASS HOUSE is another over-plotted, overwritten and entirely overblown Hollywood thriller that goes over age-old ground without ever finding its own original standing. It's a sanitised, teen-friendly movie with a teen lead and a narrative that hints at plenty but never once approaches anything remotely dark.",/review/rw2847855/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2004,Smells_Like_Cheese,1," I hated this movie
","Ah, The Glass House, this is the movie I've tried to forget, I got dragged to the movie theater with my friends to see this, I just knew that I wasn't going to get into it. I feel bad because I always say to people even if you have a gut feeling that a movie is going to be bad, just try to have an open mind and enjoy the film. My main problem though? I can't stand Leelee Sobieski, seriously, ever since I saw Heaven on Earth, her face just, I can't describe it, she annoys the heck out of me. But I did decide rather than just complain through the whole movie, I would just try to sit and see maybe if the film could have been worth the watch at least, well, I was wrong.",/review/rw2847855/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2001,jacksonblueman6,8," Not too bad of a thriller
","I was dragged to this, and I wasn't exactly looking forward to it.  First of all, it is PG-13, and I knew that it was probably aiming at teenage girls. To my surprise it wasn't bad at all.  It had really good acting, and the guy who played Terry Glass was awesome.  The scenery and house were both awesome, yet sort of creepy.  See it if your girlfriend or date drags you to it, and put up a fight, so that you can pick the next movie. And if you just want to see a decent movie in a time of wannabe slasher movies, see it.",/review/rw2847855/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2006,GOWBTW,8," Throw rocks and other projectiles at the critics, not the movie!
","Suspense is what drives a good movie. ""The Glass House"" is a very intriguing and suspenseful movie. I don't why the critics put down on it. I thought it's very entertaining. I don't know about the script, but the plot is very good. Being orphaned is a painful process to go through. An accident is an accident right? For some people it's hard to accept, for Ruby(Leelee Sobieski) and Rhett(Trevor Morgan) their parents death was NO accident! It was total sabotage. The Baker siblings suspect their guardians The Glasses(Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane) of their murder. The Bakers live in their house, but the living conditions makes the slums look like a better place to live. Ruby has no privacy, when she changes clothes, she knows it's not her brother watching. When they found out that The Glasses are after the money, it's up to themselves to stop these greedy guardians. This movie is kinda of like most other movies I've seen, somehow, the sex appeal, and the mind-games are always there to make it look good. Fine movie, fine cast, I probably ambush the The Glass House in a gauntlet and made sure the kids are safe. Better yet, sell everything the Glasses own! Rating 3 out of 5 stars.",/review/rw2847855/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2011,alannasser,8," one of the better contemporary thrillers
","What confirms this movie as a watchable thriller are two things: its fairly artful adherence to the best conventions of the genre, and the far above average performances of its principals, with a good villain an especially important requirement. I have hitherto been unimpressed with the work of Leelee Sobieski (spelling?), but here she does well, perhaps because her character is so distressed that Sobieski's standard expressionlessness comes off here as depression that is appropriate to her character. Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgard put in skilled and nuanced performances which elevate the movie more than a few notches. Daniel Sackheim's pacing and montage are uncommonly good. This is a fine popcorn movie.",/review/rw2847855/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2001,mustangamanda,7," Not Horrific but had me Jumping
","This movie wasn't exactly the most horrific and it certainly kept to its PG-13 rating. No real blood or horror, but then again it seemed just right. It had me jumping enough to be tense and the plot/story line wasn't exactly as cheesy as I had expected it to be. I would recommend it at least as a pretty good rental. And I wouldn't say I wasted my money going to the theater for it either.",/review/rw2847855/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2001,Spanner-2,7," Moderately Effective Thriller
","A moderately effective thriller featuring a capable performance by Leelee Sobieski as a teenage girl who, along with her younger brother, is taken in by a couple of old family friends after the mysterious deaths of her parents. The story is fairly predictable as thrillers go, but Sobieski delivers a performance that has enough spark to keep the audience interested and the production design and the look of the `glass house' that they live in are impressive.

9 August 2013,Natsu21,3," Had potential but fell flat
","I started off watching this movie with generally high hopes of it being a decent film. Very quickly though it became apparent it wasn't. It was just so clichéd and boring. Also a lot of stuff happening in the film didn't make sense. For starters when Ruby goes and sees the lawyer and tells him about all the problems she is having at the Glass home, he goes on about how if she doesn't stay with them she and her brother become wards of the state. This does not make sense since Ruby and her brother have an uncle who would be more than happy to take them in they set this up right at the start of the movie. the lawyer does send a social worker to check out the house though, but at the end of the movie you find out he had warned Mr Glass about her coming. Last time I checked isn't breaking attorney client privilege illegal? or at least will get you disbarred? Also in the movie you find out Mr Glass killed the parents of the children, so he could get guardianship of the kids and have access to their 4 million dollar trust fund. This really doesn't make sense when you consider that the parents moved away the Glass's 10 years ago, so we are meant to believe that in 10 years time the Bakers (the parents) never updated their will? Mr Glass plan all rested on him and his wife still being the legal guardians of the kids when their parents died. In the end it was just a boring movie with lots of plot holes and a lot of moments that didn't make sense.",/review/rw2847855/?ref_=tt_urv
