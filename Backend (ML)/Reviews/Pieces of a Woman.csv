","""Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon"" was a hugely popular anime based on the Manga by Naoko Takeuchi. It's 200 episodes are a hermetic fantasy that many don't like and never will. But I like it and I can't help myself! ",/review/rw2828153/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2006,Lady_Targaryen,8," The anime that was part of my childhood and that I loved
","''Sailor Moon""'is the anime who was an important part of my childhood. As a kid, I remember that Sailormoon, Yuyu Hakusho and Saint Seiya were the animes I most loved and cared for. ( I have the dolls until today, as well as the video game of all of them!) All the comedy,romance,drama and fantasy presents in sailormoon, as well as so many and different characters, makes a hard thing to not be in love with this awesome anime! We even have the Greek myth of Selene and Endymion here! I only don't give it a ''10'', because in many seasons there are lots of unnecessary stuff only to make the series longer. I suggest to people who watched the anime to also read the manga, that has many important stuff that are not present in the series.",/review/rw2828153/?ref_=tt_urv

9 May 2006,CaughtInTheAct,10," How DARE this show be given 3 stars out of 10??
","I am at a lost for words at how ONE vote of ONE can bring down the rating on this show so much! I've seen how many people absolutely adore this show, and I'm one of them. The show definitely deserves a better rating and definitely a better glance. I've watched this show for about 11 years now (I'm 17 now), and I'm still absolutely attached. Of course when I first watched, it was the DiC English dubbed version. Curiosity got the better of me though, and to this date I've seen 85% of the Japanese episodes. It's really a shame how this show was butchered when it was dubbed, and how so many people still dismiss this show as a ""kid's show"". Sailor Moon is so much more though. It's relatable in a lot of ways, like self consciousness and relationship problems, and it covers a lot of issues, such as homosexuality, sexuality in general, violence, etc. there's even swearing for goodness sake. I wouldn't really consider those ""kid's show qualities"". ",/review/rw2828153/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2006,xcal2,," A certified classic in my eyes
","When i think back on what got me into Anime i instantly think of Sailor Moon. I've been watching Anime now for 12 years now and i would have never known about it,if it wasn't for this show. The characters are lovable and enjoyable. I like the main character, Serena because almost in ever anime the characters are self righteous or arrogant but Serena was Goofy and a klutz and i fell in love with the character just for those things. The comedy was well balanced out and the show had some pretty funny moments! The comedy was added to balance out the drama and romance and it worked well. That brings me to the romance...i just got to say this show has some of the best hook ups and heart breaks EVER! The action was great! I loved how as time passed the characters got better and learned more and more about they're hidden past and where they came from. I also liked how the show let you get to know the villains unlike most shows where the villain is there just to further the plot by telling his plans or attacking the hero of the story! Sailor Moon really let you get the chance to know who the enemy really is! In short Sailor Moon is a certified classic and a personal favorite of mine.",/review/rw2828153/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2006,anime_sm,," Sailor Moon... brilliant, just...WOW!
","OK. Sailor Moon... WOW! I first got into this when I was 8 years old (when it was shown on Fox Kids). This was the American Dub. I waited 2 years after they cancelled the show until I finally decided that it wasn't going to come back. From then until 24/08/05 (around then anyway) I wanted it on DVD. After spending, wait for it... nearly 100 quid on all 200 episodes and the 3 films I WAS NOT disappointed. It's true what everyone says - Japanese version is sooo much better. The jokes are funnier, it's not as babyish, there's a lot of real-life stuff (boyfriends, friends, school etc) that is also really interesting. I bought Sailor Moon S and Super S as the ones with an English audio option (Japanese also though) but when it came to it, the dub was so terrible, the voices also, that I just carried on watching in Japanese with English subtitles. Seriously - the voices are great (they are so believable and fitting the person that I can't even express it in words) and on the American dub they are terrible (sooooo terrible)!!! I have to recommend watching all of the episodes because the best season by far, in my opinion, is Sailor Stars (the 5th and final) so you kind of need to have seen the others. But this season has so much good stuff - the introduction of Seiya, Yaten and Taiki etc just make you watch episode after episode. Also Galaxia comes and the whole plot of Sailor Moon becomes clear. Why everything happened in the first place... It's just BRILLIANT. I'm not saying anymore because it would be spoiling it but the battles between everyone and Galaxia are so intense. And I love the idea that 'everyone shines' but you won't get that unless you've seen it.",/review/rw2828153/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2001,anthy16,," Japanese version, gooood!!! U.S version, baaaaaad!!!
","Gosh darn it all, DiC!!  Do you HAVE to destroy everything you touch?!!! See, this series is very good (though sappy at times, a bit annoying when the episodes are badly animated)... but with bad voice-overs and horrid editing (thanks to those narrow-minded, bigoted people who think homosexual undertones and other religions are ""occult"" and ""perverse"") this series bites... no wonder so many people hate Sailormoon.  It's too bad, though, because the Japanese version is incredibly better.  It's funny, sweet, and intriguing at key points in the series.  And yeah, the girls are scantily clad... but hey, it's anime.  Everybody's scantily clad in most anime.  And it takes nothing away from the series unless you are a) a puritan idiot, or b) a perverted idiot who is too busy trying to look up their skirts that you take no time to appreciate the series.  This is a good cartoon.  Don't knock it till you've seen it... in Japanese.",/review/rw2828153/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2004,medeawilson,," Pretty Soldier gets bad rep
","Bishoujo Senshi Seeraa Muun (or as known in the States as Simply Sailor Moon) is the story of a normal girl, Tsukino Usagi/Serena (who loves food and hates school--wow, that's so horrible! Sounds like any 14 yr old girl that's somewhat normal), who finds out she's the reincarnation of the Pretty Sailor Suited Soldier Sailor Moon. The show originally ran from 1992-1994 (They showed the first season in the US in 1992 and ran through what we know as the Doom Tree saga, where DiC dropped the show).",/review/rw2828153/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 1999,Clariztbel,," This is my favorite cartoon (after Snoopy)
","(First, I want to ask for your forgiveness, my English is not perfect since I'm not a native speaker)I have to warn you I'm not talking about the DIC version.  Here in Panama we were lucky enough to have the Japanese Version shown on our screens.  Yes, it was translated into Spanish, but I guess it didn't lose too much of the magic it must have in its original language for I really enjoyed it.  And I really think that Serena is a nice example for girls.  The only thing I don't like about her is her feelings about school; but you can see all along the story that she matures, and at the end (when she finally wins over Sailor Galaxia) Serena is a much stronger girl who will continue growing and who will be prepared when the moment comes and she has to take her place as Neo Queen Serena. It is somehow funny for me to think that here in Panama we are more open to deal with such themes as homosexuality that in your country (personally I believe that Haruka and Michiro form the most beautiful couple in the series).  I don't think it is true.  What I believe is that you, citizens of the United States of America, have to get real, and that you have to stop trying to convince yourself you are so innocent.  Believe me, I don´t have anything against you, I believe you have a wonderful country which I plan to visit some day, but sometimes I really don't know who are you trying to deceive.  You say one thing, but the rest of the world through the movies, the T.V. and the Internet is looking at a very very different truth. So, to conclude, I just have to say that if you can, watch the original version.  I haven't seen the DIC version, but I'm pretty sure it can't be equal or better.  Don't do it because I'm telling you, do it because Serena really deserves it!",/review/rw2828153/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2012,TheLittleSongbird,10," One of my favourite anime series ever
","I love anime, and Sailor Moon is one of the finest examples of anime I've seen. I do have to agree though that the Japanese version is the better version, the English DiC version for my tastes sounds sloppy and nowhere near as heartfelt. I love the ethereal quality of the animation, the theme tune is so catchy and the incidental music for the transformation sequences stay long in the mind. The writing is often hilarious and heartfelt, and the story lines are throughly engrossing with great action(the Japanese version also benefits from that the action sequences don't feel choppy). The characters are likable and engaging, and the voice work in the Japanese version is dynamic.",/review/rw2828153/?ref_=tt_urv

","WARNING: REFERENCE TO AN EPISODE. IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED IT AND DON'T WANT IT SPOILED, DON'T READ THIS REVIEW! I absolutely love Sailor Moon! I absolutely hate it when people say 'it's for babies' and won't change their opinion even when you say it's not! It's so romantic, as well as being full of action that immediately captures your interest. For that matter, I have an aunt in her forties and she adores Sailor Moon.",/review/rw2828153/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2002,WavesofSilence,," I love SailorMoon,but DiC killed it...
","Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon...one of the greatest animes I have ever seen,but DiC butchered it,and I mean seriously. In the original japanese version, Sailor Moon was made for all ages,but the target audience was mostly teens. why? because SailorMoon features things such as : scantily clad fourteen year olds, transsexuality, gender changes (in the Stars season the starlights changed into males when they came to earth then turn female again when they transform) mushy romance, violence, death of the main characters, reincarnation, etc. But in the DiC dub version, many of these things were taken out.",/review/rw2828153/?ref_=tt_urv

","it was one of my favorite shows as a kid and once I grew older I kind of forgotten about it but then out of nowhere I remember the song My Only Love which is the song that was played when we find out that Serena is the princess of the moon kingdom which then my friend had that episode and I remember being a kid again and remembering all the good times with this show and now I am planning to see the Japanese version as well which I never knew there was till I did research of the show and the things that I found interesting about the Japanese version is: -Sailor Neptune and Uranus are lovers instead of cousins which I kind of had a feeling that they were and I guess I was right -Zoicite and Malachite were homosexuals and in love -Zoicite was a man which shocked me like crazy you wouldn't understand -The music and the extra scenes that wouldn't show in the American version because of the children (for example: how Darian chokes Serena when Darian was in Queen Beryl's control -Extra episodes such as if the parents would keep Luna in the home and so much more I have finished the first season of the Japanese version and it wasn't bad at all but I like the American version abit better and its not just cause American version they spoke in English or anything like that its just when I watched it I just couldn't get into it like I got with the American version I ain't saying that the Japanese version is bad they are both good and I am still gonna watch season 2 of Sailor Moon in Japanese to see more I hope they put back Sailor Moon on TV so I can see season 5 in the American version to see what that would be like and what else I liked about Sailor Moon was the relationship with Serena And Darien from the beginning the fight,pain,love,trust,lost,gain that I always wanted a relationship like that which is so beautiful ",/review/rw2828153/?ref_=tt_urv

",Like with most of these Japanese cartoons (Animes) the American version is enormously censored and a lot of times they leave a lot of obvious stuff behind which just makes you want to make fun of it. I've never seen the Japanese version so I can't compare but with the story lines this cartoon has and with what I've heard about the uncensored version I'm sure it was pretty cool but this version is only good for making fun of it.,/review/rw2828153/?ref_=tt_urv

","Okay, so I'm a college student. The run of Sailor Moon - US - lasted from the time I was 8 in 1995 to the time I was 14 in 2001. Sure, there was a lot of issues with the company politics, and it made itself evident in the series - with such issues as voice acting and music, and, to an extent, even the series itself.

","I have a love-hate relationship. If it weren't for the dub, I probably would not have ever been exposed to the cartoon that is Sailor Moon. Since I don't know were to get fansubs, the dubbed cartoon and the internet are my only ways of gaining information on the show. I admit, I am a Sailor Moon purist and do wish they'd aimed for an older audience instead of going for the Y7 crowd. Perhaps had it been geared towards teenagers, things like lesbian relationships and violence would have been less shocking. Already with the dubbing, twisted little things have sneaked through. (Hey Moonies, remember DIC's euphemism for breasts?)Male characters were changed to women (""Oh no we can't have gays! We musn't have gays in our show). As you can tell by the above comment, one of the biggest changes is the one I find the most unnecessary. Come on DIC, we are going to meet gay people in our life.

5 May 2001,SHB_73,," Super Sailor
","I'm not the biggest fan of anime but this series I've always liked. I've only seen the English version of the series so far, It's very entertaining. The storyline is about a schoolgirl named Serena who is granted superpowers to protect the earth from the evil Queen Beryl of the Negaverse, an evil other dimension. Along the way more Sailor scouts show up to help fight alongside her (Sailor Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Mercury Uranus, Neptune etc.) While the animation is sloppy and scenes are constantly recycled, it makes up for it with it's story lines and characters that grow on you. I know a lot of people are upset because of the heavy editing of controversial subjects surrounding the show, One in particularly that catches me is the supposed lesbian relationship between Amara and Michelle (Salior Uranus and Sailor Neptune). Granted it raises a few eyebrows, but to people who have never traveled out of the U.S.A. They wouldn't understand. In foreign countries such as Japan, Italy, etc. Sailor Moon has become a cultural phenomenon throughout the world. Movie star Geena Davis almost got the green light to produce a live-action feature film with her playing the evil Queen Beryl. But currently that project is in limbo right now, I do hope it get's made in the future. Sailor moon is one of the best animes to come out of Japan",/review/rw2828153/?ref_=tt_urv

","Sailor Moon is a really good anime...for kids. I watched it a couple of years ago when I still liked this kind of anime but now when I look back I wonder why I liked it. Sure the anime is fun and as almost every anime there are some cute guys in it. But the story of all the seasons is so repetitive it's almost annoying. And what about the ""transformation"" of the girls and the boys - it's shown in every episode - really not necessary. And they don't really transform, they just change their clothes - you can still recognize them. And I know that this is done for kids not to be confused but I don't really like it. The characters were sometimes annoying, too, but overall I didn't mind. They didn't have a lot of development which is a shame considering the number of seasons. I recommend this anime for the kids...adults I think will be disappointed if they watch it.",/review/rw2828153/?ref_=tt_urv
