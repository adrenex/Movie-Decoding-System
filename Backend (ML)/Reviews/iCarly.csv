8 January 2023,facondra,10," The Hammwr
",It was great. My husband and I loved it. It needs a series. We need a series. Reba is not only a great singer but an excellent actor. Peterson also did well In the movie. All around great movie. I like the 3 together as actors. I can't remember the older guys name but he's also the actor in young Sheldon. He also plays in Big sky with her. I liked the way they came up with why they called her the hammer. That was clever. Killing the cat was kinda sad considering it was her dads companion but I know it made the show and you didn't want them to kill the dad or sister. I really do wish you can come up with a series.,/review/rw8839998/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,danielkingston,10," More!
","When I first saw the trailer I didn't realise it was for a film, it felt like was going to be a series and I was really disappointed to find out it was a one off (even more so now I've watched it)",/review/rw8839998/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2023,yfqcvbbd,10," Great movie
","I loved this movie and thought it was the premiere of a series. I am disappointed. I hope the powers that be see the potential to make it a series. I will certainly tune in. I didn't know Reba had such great comedic timing. She is funny!!!! Her character had a tough exterior but a soft heart that gave the movie much substance. You can tell throughout the film there is a trauma she has been through, making her a fantastic judge. I wish our justice system were like this. Great clean entertainment in a time when it is hard to find movies like the good ole days! I will watch it again since I taped it!",/review/rw8839998/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,stephenebrowe,9," Should be a series!
",Loved this movie. Always been a fan of Reba and she didn't disappoint. The rest of the cast was excellent. The movie really was written like it was a pilot episode for a series. When I first heard about Reba starring in The Hammer I just assumed it was a series and was surprised to find out it was a movie. I really hope that it becomes a series on a network or a series of movies.,/review/rw8839998/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,tinatalksavon,10," Needs to be a weekly SERIES!!!
","GREAT movie!!! The whole time we were watching this movie, my hubby kept thinking it was a weekly series - even though I kept telling him NO. We're both disappointed because it really DOES need to be a weekly series - and still could be.",/review/rw8839998/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2023,zbsharp,10," Great movie, I hope there are more
","This was a fabulous movie. I loved the down home country expressions and story lines. Watching the movie made me look up more information and I found that the movie is based on a real traveling judge who covers this territory. Between the judge's new appointment as a judge, as well as Judge Wheeler's history with that territory, this movie was quite interesting.",/review/rw8839998/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,Jackbv123,7," Fun and quirky despite the ominous undertones
","I see three reviews that say based on previews they thought this was a series but it's a one time movie. Well make that 4. I figured it out when I set the recording and it wasn't a series. I also have to agree this would make a decent series. I think Reba's character is perfect for it. But it would stretch credulity to have Kim solving a new murder every week in this setting, and that was pretty much what the story behind this movie was. It's a murder mystery set with a quirky irreverent country judge.",/review/rw8839998/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,paulekearney2,10," Should be a series or at least a series of movies
","This is a great chance to have a series & develop a group of characters that need the depth teased to us explored. No too campy, not too unbelievable & something lighthearted that anyone can enjoy. Reba fans will especially like it.",/review/rw8839998/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,telmealing-47271,4," Judge Judy on speed
","My first review on here, i dont normally post comments but i thought the 8 rating was a little too high for this movie and as there are no other reviews wondered where that score came from???",/review/rw8839998/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,toreborgen,2," Probably for Reba McEntire fans
","Watched this movie after seing the trailer. Looked ok so I decided to give it a shot. I have no idea who Reba McEntire is and i don't like country music. Actors are ok, story is thin and not especially good i my view. I generally like feelgod movies that make me laugh. Sure, it has it's moments, and i'm sure Reba McEntire fans will like it. But for those who don't know who she is i really don't see the point in watching this movie. I fear this is yet another movie that is best on trailer, and the movie not so much. Sure, after googling Reba McEntire i guess she is a legend and all that. Good for her. But this movie is at best boring.",/review/rw8839998/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,benniehend-20741,9," I love Reba!!
","I kept wanting to comb her hair! It was awful! Other than that, I really enjoyed the movie. I actually thought it was the first episode of her new series. I hope there is more. Please tell the powers that be, and Reba, that we would love to see her on TV every week again. This has got be going back to look at her first series. I just laugh and laugh. I love that she and Melissa Peterman were onscreen together again. This character limit is ridiculous! I am trying to find things to say. Love that she and her real life boyfriend get to work together. Hope that does not put a strain on their relationship.",/review/rw8839998/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,kat-44877,10," This really could be the next BIG SERIES!
","I loved this movie so much, and it definitely has the potential to be a long running series! Judge wheeler needs to put the other judge in his place. She can rattle more cages with modernizing things a bit, and need to see where the history is with Bart.",/review/rw8839998/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2023,tootiejo,1," Online reviews are being hacked to embarrass the judge
","I have tried to get some attention to this issue, but I've had no luck, so I'm gonna try here. There are at least three or more online reviews from reliable news sources where Judge Leslie Wheeler's name has been changed to a crude word for male genitalia that begins with W. I can only guess this is a hack job meant to embarrass the judge. I have reached out to Lifetime, Reba McEntire and the reviewers but heard nothing back. I would like somebody to try and find out why this is happening. It went from one review to three now and I'm pretty sure it won't stop there. I am perplexed as to why the news sources I contacted, which includes UPI and KGET, have ignored this problem and done nothing to address the hacking of their online review.",/review/rw8839998/?ref_=tt_urv
