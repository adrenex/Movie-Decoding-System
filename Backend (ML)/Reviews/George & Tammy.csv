22 December 2021,Fella_shibby,7," Entertaining heist movie with top notch cinematography.
",I enjoyed this one more than its predecessor.,/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2021,cricketbat,7," Is this the first time a spin-off is better than the original?
","I wasn't expecting much from Army of Thieves, but I ended up liking this prequel spin-off more than I liked Army of the Dead. The characters are what really make this movie enjoyable. Matthias Schweighöfer, Nathalie Emmanuel, and the rest of the gang have good chemistry & entertaining dialogue. And while it does seem strange to have a zombie apocalypse NOT be the center of your story, this film was still a fun ride.",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,danielmanson,7," Better than Army of the Dead
",I'll be honest I was not a fan of Army of the Dead at all. So I had absolutely no expectations watching this and I have to say it is much better than I thought it would be. They also picked one of the better characters to do a prequel on also.,/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2021,blanche-2,8," A prequel to Army of the Dead
","This is good fun, and part of a series of films. I've only seen this one so far. This is a prequel to Army of the Dead.",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2021,Calicodreamin,5," Meh
","Not bad but not great either, very meh. The safecracking is repetitive and the police chasing was lazy. The movie tried to be self aware but it didn't work. The team lacked chemistry and acting was only okay. Only good thing going is stunning visuals.",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2021,roondogbb,8," A prequel that actually improves upon the original.
","Many people out there will not like the type of film that Army of Thieves is. Yet many people like myself love it. So, much like the previous film, scores will will either be very low or quite high.... A super serious drama Army of Thieves is not. What it is however is 2 hours, of light drama laced with comedy that is very enjoyable. It tells a prequel story of how the master safe cracker Sebastian, comes to be involved in the world of crime. Joining with a crew that include Gwendoline (Nathalie Emmanuel) as the master thief, Brad Cage (Stuart Martin) as the muscle, Beatrix (Noémie Nakai) as the hacker and finally Rolph (Guz Khan) as the Driver. All the actors and actresses were very good. Its not the type of script/film that one of them could show a 10/10 performance, however they brought to life the good script at hand",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,frank-liesenborgs,7," A very positive surprise, craving for more.
","What makes this movie different is that it excels in the filming of the details. Every time they crack a safe and the film zooms in on the details, it is just marvellous. And then there is the superb acting of mainly Nathalie Emmanuel (Gwendoline) and Matthias Schweighöfer (Dieter). The plot and storyline are predictable but this does not prevent to put a quality label on this movie. Just watch the credits at the end, then you realize what an amount of work has been put into this movie. Now I am waiting for a sequel where they go for the fourth and final Wagner vault! This is not a zombie movie but a thoroughbred heist movie. Heist movies tend of course to be similar and predictable, and ""Army of Thieves"" is not different. You've got all the usual stuff from the assembly of the team of experts with highly specialized skills to the double-crossing. I was also happy to see a Nixon mask during a heist. The last time I saw this was in 1991 (Point Break)
""Army of Thieves,"" is a prequel starring and directed by the ""Army of the Dead"" ensemble player Matthias Schweighöfer and takes place in the very early days of the zombie apocalypse. With the undead safely confined to the United States, the Europe-set ""Thieves"" is free to focus entirely on pulling of the biggest heist in history.",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2021,SnoopyStyle,6," more Dieter, less zombies
",This is a prequel to Army of the Dead (2021). Sebastian (Matthias Schweighöfer) is a mild-mannered bank teller by day and a YouTube expert on safes by night. His clip has one view. It's master thief Gwendoline (Nathalie Emmanuel) and she recruits him into her gang. They're planning to breaking into three legendary safes.,/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,denden85,6," Interesting and disappointing at the same time
","The movie starts in a very unique way. It is artistic and creates an interesting built up. The pace of the movie is fast enough to keep you awake, which is good; even if you're not too excited about the happening, you still don't get bored. However, the end of the movie doesn't make enough sense. It felt like sort of another movie. It's like nobody knew how to finish it properly, in an interesting and meaningful way. Also, ""Army"" of Thieves doesn't make much sense either. Where's the ""Army""? The ending of the movie might make more sense if there's second movie to it, but in any case, the ending is not fun.",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,Master_Strange,7," The Safe Mechanisms are Beautifully Conveyed
","The acting was great across the line and kept me engaged. The plot was cliche, but what do you expect, its a recycled idea, but that's what makes it great. I've seen the story told time and time again, yet it still stayed engaging throughout. The cinematography is faultless especially the way the safe mechanisms are beautifully conveyed. I really enjoyed the movie whole time , a bit comical with series of bank heist . The acting and cinematography , background music all spot on.",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,paul_haakonsen,3," Essentially just a super boring heist movie...
","Wow, the prequel that you never knew would happen and you never really wanted. Now, the 2021 movie ""Army of the Dead"" was somewhat of a swing and a miss, and then comes the follow-up, which actually is a sequel about the character that was one of the least interesting. So this definitely has the ingredients for a smash hit. Right?",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2021,Tweetienator,3," Army of Brain Cell Killers
","That's what we needed, a prequel to one of the worst big production zombie movies and major disappointments in years (I should add that I like Snyder's remake of Dawn of the Dead a lot) - Army of Thieves is at best a mediocre heist movie, and as a zombie movie a fail like Army of the Dead. Who wants this? Who finances such a idea? It looks like these days every (crap) idea gets produced because some pay channel needs new ""content"" to lobotomize the audience to brain dead mode.",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,Holt344,7," Army of Thieves is a flawed yet very entertaining heist film, a great prequel - My Ultimate Review
","Zack Snyder serves as a producer and co-writer for the prequel to his Army of the Dead which is titled Army of Thieves, but the screenplay is written by Shay Hatten who was behind John Wick 3 and its sequels but of course serving as a co-writer for Army of the Dead. But Snyder leaves the director duties to Matthias Schweighöfer who was a stand out star in the original who also who reprises his role as Ludwig Dieter, alongside a supporting cast that includes Nathalie Emmanuel and a couple of lesser known actors like Ruby O. Fee, Stuart Martin, Guz Khan and Jonathan Cohen.",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2021,nlsteven-attheMovies,6," It's a Steal
","Army of Thieves is a superior (zombie-less) prequel to Zack Snyder's original zombie fest ""Army Of The Dead"". Although this is a predictable Netflix production, there are enough action, twists, shallow dialogue and romance for an evening of entertaining viewing. Set in Europe, Army of Thieves is a starring vehicle for German director/writer Matthias Schweighöfer, who shines in the lead role as the nerdy and silly safecracker and in giving a European angle to the film's directing. Hans Zimmer's music score also gets a thumbs up, and so does Bernhard Jasper's cinematography work.",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2021,CANpatbuck3664,7," Lower Stakes and Lower Key, Thieves Goes a Different Route From Dead and Might be Better For it
","Dieter was one of my favourite parts of Army of the Dead. There are moments where he falls into the ""weird European"" trope but Matthias played it well and he got more than a few laughs from me. Giving his character his own movie was a bold choice and while Matthias retains his charm as Dieter, making him the main player stretches that likeability to its limits. He starts to grate in certain scenes but the movie pulls back enough that it didn't become annoying or ruin the experience. His naivety and underdog spirit are still relatable considering the circumstances. I can't say much either way about the other members of the team, only Gwendoline avoids being a stock character, even if her interest in Dieter is a little puzzling. There's nothing wrong with the characterization in Army but other than Dieter, it's not driven by strong character development.",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,kathmummybear,7," I liked it
",Not perfect but entertaining .so much better than army of the dead ! And I like zombies I wish there had been more for Guz Khan character to do definitely a missed opportunity for some humour.,/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2021,andrewchristianjr,8," MUCH MORE FUN.
","This was much more fun. Doesn't take itself too (at all) seriously, and takes us all on a very entertaining ride. The imagery of the out and insides of the safes, and location sets were excellent. But the entire film was nothing spectacular or we haven't already seen in a heist film. The directing, cinematography and casting & performances were great, but it was the infantile cheesy writing that just didn't do it for me. The entire love/jealousy dynamics was predictable and too overbearing for a heist film.",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," Fun and cute, but too much cheesy mushiness.

And as for this being a prequel to Army of the Dead, it was simply an entire film about a safecracker who in the last 5 minutes meets up with Bautista's character for AOTD. That's pretty much the only association lol. Still, fun and cute, but too much cheesy mushiness. It's a 7/10 from me.",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,tonymars-63087,1," Unnecessary mess of cliched garbage
","Horribly written, horribly executed, brutishly jammed with corny looking characters. Just a complete mess of a movie. Trying to be too many things at one time and failing at them all.",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,kuarinofu,3," I don't know what's happening

29 October 2021,arungeorge13,5," No big surprises here - it's a heist film, minus the zombies! [+52%]
","With a fairly predictable plot and one-dimensional characters, Army of Thieves (Army, it definitely isn't!) proves to be an easy heist flick to watch; one that feels 20-25 minutes too long. The Ludwig Dieter origin story is everything you'd expect it to be: this works both in favor of and against the film. The cast, barring the lead duo of Matthias Schweighöfer and Nathalie Emmanuel, is a disappointing blend of misses (than hits). Also, the essential part of a heist film is the tension it manages to raise during the heist scenes - here, it's all a piece of cake - no scenes that make you go OMG! To add some more time to the process, Dieter (or Sebastian, his original name) keeps explaining stories about a locksmith that really has zero payoffs in the plot. Or at least, the film makes you feel that way!",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2021,ops-52535,5," too smooth...
","The plot far too plantastic, or made of plastic, its made for the one who have the ability to switch of every rational thinking, or just for, what plain people call breadheads, cause this is far too superfantastic fiction that even worse than mission impossible. If you like the guts of an old safes lockmechanism, or just admire beautiful safe doors, then see it, for the rest its just a head over heels plot of utopian crime, and all the reasons for me to say so is a 355 list of remarks why much of this is inevitablly impossible. The list can be obtained if you send me a thumbs up.",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2021,Pairic,7," Zombie Lite Bank Caper
","Army of Thieves: Zombie Lite prequel to Army of the Dead. Ludwig Dieter (Matthias Schweighöfer) the ace safe-cracker in AOTD is a mild mannered bank clerk who has a fascination with safes. He's recruited by bank robber/jewel thief (Gwendoline Starr) to crack 3 famous safes, one of which is in Las Vegas. This is set at the start of the Zombie Apocalypse, we see Zombies going wild on TV News including devouring a reporter live on air but it's very much in the background of this heist caper. Some good action sequences during the robberies and chases, a touch of romance with betrayals thrown in. Jonathan Cohen is good as Delacroix, an Interpol agent who comes across as a more demented and violent Inspector Clouseau. Nothing really original but good fun. Might have been a better film if the running time had been cut by 15 minutes. Directed by Matthias Schweighöfe, Written by Shay Hatten and Zack Snyder. On Netflix. 7/10.",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2021,bob-the-movie-man,8," A surprising quirky rom-com heist movie
","I have Covid-19, and am confined to quarters. So with the big screen out of reach, time to catch up on some streaming films. New on Netflix is ""Army of Thieves"", a quirky prequel, of sorts, to Zac Snyder's ""Army of the Dead"".",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,HabibieHakim123,10," A Prequel That More Exciting And Better Than The Original
","It's pretty rare for me as of right now for a prequel to be more exciting and way much better than the original, director and actor Matthias Schweighöfer is surprisingly can not only managed the acting (so do the other) and the direction but the visual, the cinematography, it's fantastic, it's superb, Army Of Thieves is a fun ride, it's a pleasant surprise and it's worth to watch, overall, Army Of Thieves is one of the most entertaining movie in 2021.",/review/rw7493963/?ref_=tt_urv
