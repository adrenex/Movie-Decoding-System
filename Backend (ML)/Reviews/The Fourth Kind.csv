16 October 2015,ivo-cobra8,7," A good Indiana Jones film not as good as the trilogy, but still a good fourth installment sequel
","Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) isn't a bad film -- there are a few dazzling sequences, and a couple of good performances -- but the unprecedented blend of comedy and action that made the movies so much more fun than any other adventure series is mostly gone. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies even tough is a bad sequel but it is still good in my opinion. ",/review/rw1881062/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2010,MBunge,3," South Park got this thing exactly right
","Alas, poor Indy, we knew you well. You were one of the greatest characters in movie history, star of one of the best films of all time and a couple of good sequels. But now, a couple of decades later, your creators have brought you back to the big screen. Your return, though, doesn't remind us of how much fun you used to be. Instead, you've been resurrected as a garish, shambling, poorly constructed Frankenstein.",/review/rw1881062/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2020,fernandoschiavi,6," The film tries to honor to the science fiction films B films of the time. Has good moments but the problematic script turns it in the worst of the series so far
","19 years after a perfect ending to the trilogy, behold, George Lucas, Frank Marshall and Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford come together again to produce Indiana Jones' fourth adventure. This time, the film pays honor to the science fiction films B films of the time. The decision was certainly risky, since almost two decades had passed, having to introduce the character, now older and without the same mobility as before, to a new generation, in addition to having to overcome one of the most acclaimed trilogies of cinema at all times.",/review/rw1881062/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2008,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," A tribute to the fans
","Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the 19 year long awaited sequel, the big summer blockbuster is finally here! I was lucky enough to see the premiere tonite, my hopes were up, the audience was pumped, everyone was just excited, why wouldn't you be? This was the Indiana Jones to blow the trilogy out of the water. Unfortunately, I'm feeling a little empty, I am such a huge fan of the trilogy, movies that hold memories for me as well as excitement still to this day when I watch the Indiana Jones movies. Indiana is back, this film had a little bit of the old style that I was looking forward too, however, I feel like we were lied too. The makers of the film told us there would be no CGI unless it was needed like the old films, not only was there a lot of CGI, the older films had special effects, but they were real, this was a little too cartoonish at times. Not only that, but I felt like the 50's stereotype was being too rubbed in our faces: the jocks vs. greasers, the cold war fear, nuclear bomb testings, the Russians, and the aliens. I'm not going to lie, while the movie is flawed; this is still a fun action packed adventure film that is worth the full price ticket. I think the story was just more of a tribute rather than an actual movie on it's own.",/review/rw1881062/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2021,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,5," Easily the weakest of the Indiana Jones films.
","Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has become cinematic infamy incarnate, and not without good reason: the fridge-nuke scene, the out-of-place sci-fi aliens that are introduced in the movie's final act, Cate Blanchett's stilted Russian baddy-cutout, and the unfortunate retconning of Sean Connery's character being reduced to a simple framed photograph make for awkward viewing that culminated in 2008's greatest cinematic disappointment; not to mention the 50s-haircut monkeys and John Hurt being WASTED. And this was 2008: where we had real bangers like Wall-E, The Dark Knight, Hellboy II: The Golden Army, Iron Man, Kung Fu Panda and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.",/review/rw1881062/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2008,maxdetroit,6," We have grown up .. Indy stays the same
","Sorry, but after reading all this negative comments, I like to give you my thoughts on this. When I walked out of the movie I was not really satisfied, because some things bothers me, like the monkey-rope scene and some other ridiculous and illogical things. But, then I remembered scenes from the first three movies, like jumping out of a plane with a rubber boat and then bob run with it down the Himalaya. Or Indy hanging on top of submarine and then swims with it through half of the ocean (isn't such a thing going underwater sometimes?). Well, what I want to say is that in the old Indy films there where tons of ridiculous stunts and it always was very cartoonish and yes, often cheesy. But as I child I liked those movies for that. They are just adventures with a lot of action, mystic and fun, not more.",/review/rw1881062/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2008,danielledecolombie,5," Not that it matters but ...why?
","The film is making zillions all over the world so what does it matter that it's just a mediocre attempt to recapture the energy, the youthfulness and the innocence of the previous installments? Love of cinema, that's what made me react the way I did. How can it possibly be that the most powerful people in the film world could agree that this was the script that everyone was waiting for? Shallow, opportunistic, over long, over crowded and implausible in a way the other films weren't regardless of their own implausibilities because one was connected tho the soul of the enterprise. There is no soul here to cling to. It's all by the numbers, odd numbers at that. Karen Allen returns! But look at the clumsiness of her re introduction. I was bitterly disappointed but maybe it's just me.",/review/rw1881062/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2008,DrEbert,6," Entertaining in that self-parodying sort of way, but somebody PLEASE tell George Lucas to retire!!
","Usually, when you go to see an action/adventure movie, especially an Indiana Jones movie, you're going to suspend your disbelief and just allow yourself to ""get into"" the movie. These kinds of movies are supposed to be mindless escapist fun. Still, one might expect some small modicum of plausibility or connection to the real world. When it comes to ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" forget about suspending disbelief. Just pretend you're in another dimension altogether. If you do that, you'll have have met one of the two prerequisites for seeing this movie. (If you don't believe me now, you will when you see this film and see our hero survive a cataclysmic event in a fairly cartoonish manner a mere 15 minutes into the film.) The other prerequisite is that you've seen the other three movies...religiously. A huge chunk of the entertainment value of this film comes from nostalgia, in-jokes, and self-parody. It is an entertaining movie and I had fun and laughed while I was watching it and the reason for this is because we are either enjoying seeing all of the same old gags done once again in a bigger and cooler way, or we are enjoying seeing those gags mocked. Trusty bullwhip? Check. Fedora? Check. Long car chase with fighting and leaping and what-not? Check. Dark tombs lit only by torches? Check. Gross creepy crawly critters? Check.",/review/rw1881062/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2020,MR-ODIN,," Indiana Jones
","Many will definitely argue this addition to the 'Indiana Jones' saga was unnecessary and somewhat confusing. But as another film, you can't deny Spielberg's crisp direction and Harrison Ford's slick leading performance. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is visually a blockbuster success, though potholes could be avoided in its story and plot, it's still stable nonetheless.",/review/rw1881062/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2008,bobsgrock,7," It's fun for some, disappointing for others.
","After a long nineteen year wait, Indiana Jones is back on the big screen hamming it up and continuing his search for rare and wild artifacts that could seriously take someone's life away. This film has Jones in the late 1950s fighting against the Soviets in order to obtain a crystal skull found in Peru which they believe will give them absolute knowledge over all other countries. Without telling the spoilers, it is important to state right here and now that this is definitely the weakest written of the four films. It simply doesn't give the magic and suspense that Raiders was able to throughout the entire running time. Of course the acting is good with Harrison Ford looking as good as ever and Karen Allen and Shia Labeouf supporting him well. The directing by Steven Spielberg is solid as we get some nice chase scenes and the pace is just fine. Still, it's that script that is giving me winces of pain as I watch this film. Of course, you shouldn't go into this thinking it was going to be as good or better than Raiders or the Last Crusade. I didn't expect too much and that is exactly what I got; not too much but enough to recommend for all fans of the original three to see. Are the first three the best? Of course. Should they have made this fourth one? Probably not. Still, if you are a fan, it doesn't hurt too much to see Indy crack the whip one more time.",/review/rw1881062/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2008,Chrysanthepop,," The Best Thing In This Movie Is Cate Blanchett's Sexy Ukrainian Villainess
","The problems with 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' are manifold and it certainly does not match up to it's predecessors. The film looks too artificial. What worked with the other movies was that, taking into account that they were made before the CGI boom, they looked real. Here the overuse of CGI and bluescreen grafting is painfully apparent. The story is a mess. It lacks coherency and there are too many uninteresting subplots. And, what was with the aliens? Does Spielberg harbour a secret obsession for UFOs? The pacing is slow at times and boring. The dialogues are not anything noteworthy and the action sequences, while some are fun to watch, others are plain bad and again, the prominent CGI stands in the way. With the exception of Cate Blanchett, none of the actors stand out, even Harrison Ford plays the clichéd hero. Shia LeBeouf is miscast. Ray Winstone is wasted and the rest are forgettable. Blanchett is barely recognizable as the sexy Ukrainian military villainess. She looks alluring and I her use of the accent is hilarious. She makes an awesome baddie which somewhat makes up for some of the flaws. Among the few other likable things about the movie is the chase sequence which features some well choreographed stunts. Overall, 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' disappoints and only Cate Blanchett makes up for some of the flaws.",/review/rw1881062/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2008,daveygandthekeyboard,5," Implausible action scenes kill this movie
","All I can really conclude about this movie is that it was just okay. I can forgive the ludicrous plot, the cheesy ""family"" dynamic of the film, the fact that Harrison Ford is old (which is really nowhere near the worst part of this). I don't even really mind Shia LaBeouf's presence. But many of the stunts and the action scenes are so implausible that it renders all of the action scenes implausible. For example, Shia LaBoeuf sword-fighting (!) spread-eagled on two moving vehicles; a boat going over not one, not two, but three waterfalls with absolutely no one getting a scratch (I mean, what are we watching here, The A-Team?); and the ""if the film hasn't jumped the shark yet it certainly has now"" moment--Shia LaBoeuf swinging through the jungle a la Tarzan. It was ridiculous. And because these parts are (forgive my overuse of the word) implausible, it highlights the fact that the rest of it doesn't work, either. After seeing a number of old series trying to come back for another run (Rocky Balboa, Rambo, the Star Wars Prequels) I have concluded that when filmmakers attempt to cash in on a once-popular series, artistically the best they can hope for is to break even. Sometimes there really is nowhere to go but down. I wanted to love this, but the most charitable thing I can say is that it was just okay. Very disappointing.",/review/rw1881062/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2008,Doylenf,5," Overstuffed action dominates incredible story and Indy's lame one-liners...
","Contrary to what Mr. Spielberg thinks, there is no real McGuffin, and that's just one of the many drawbacks of this new Indy film. Furthermore, it's marred by overstuffed action sequences and Indy's lame one-liners, which becomes obvious after the first ten minutes.",/review/rw1881062/?ref_=tt_urv

26 May 2008,Galina_movie_fan,8," ""For an old guy, you ain't bad in a fight.""
","After twenty seven years since the Raiders of the Last Ark introduced the archaeologist and adventurer Henry ""Indiana"" Jones who divides his time between teaching the University students in a quiet auditorium and saving the world in the incredible dangerous and breathtaking adventures, and after nineteen years since his quest for Holy Grail in the Last Crusade, Indiana Jones is back - with his fedora, leather jacket, whip, grin, fear for snakes, and the new big adventure, spectacular, fast-paced, silly, funny, and jaw-dropping at the same time. Believe it or not, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) is the first IJ movie that I've seen at the theater. They were not released in the former USSR (that's probably why, Spielberg and Lucas made their bad guys Russians this time :)) and I saw the trilogy first in the end of the 1980s when the videotapes became available. The new movie is full of adventures, has not one but three fallings down of waterfalls and the huge attacking red ants. As in all Indy movies, there is a long and spectacular signature chase sequence, this time a multi-vehicle chase through the jungle with the heroes jumping on the full speed from one car to another, two characters engaged in the sword fight standing on the parallel moving jeeps, the Crystal Scull of the title falling back and forth from the good guys to the bad ones. The ""baddest guy"" here is the girl played by Cate Blanchette wearing the uniform not unlike Dr. Evil's and the black wig a-la Louise Brooks of ""Pandora's Box"" or Uma Thurman of ""Pulp Fiction"". She plays a Russian villainess, Dr. Irina Spalko, the lead researcher of psychic phenomenon and the supernatural. Blanchette is as good as ever proving that she can play successfully any role, including the one that requires a lot of physical actions. The fourth movie takes place in the different time than the first three, and it is set against the realities of the 50s: the beginning of cold war, the double agents, the talks about UFOs and aliens. One of the scenes, as remarkable as it is memorable, depicts a ground-level nuclear test in Nevada on the picturesque town that was built only to be destroyed after the drop of atomic bomb.",/review/rw1881062/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2008,johnnymacbest,10," A classic hero returns.
","I just came back from a pre-screening of the fourth Indiana Jones movie and I say I enjoyed it IMMENSELY!!! Wow, for years now I thought that after ""War of The Worlds"" Spielberg has lost his touch; not so here. Here he returns to the basic fundamentals of the lost arts of practicality and just plain good old fashioned genuine storytelling (something that's solely lacking in today's CGI-heavy world) helped along by the big guy himself Harrison Ford along with witty and charming Shia LaBeouf as a newcomer to the franchise with George Lucas lending some support to cinematography. Ford is simply amazing as the venerable adventurer with lots of impressive stunt work. Everything is bigger and better than before, the action is of high-caliber, the plot is thorough and exciting with intelligent writing coupled with awesome special effects. But what really surprised me was that it looked like it was filmed in the 1980's; something that's rare in this Digital Age!!! I'm sure those accustomed to digital film-making may be put off, but it actually works really well and gives the film an added dose of nostalgia and sense of wonder that Spielberg brought so successfully in his past films. Not many films can achieve that feat, but I can strongly say that Spielberg has gone out on top and brought back one of the most beloved cinematic heroes around for one more time.",/review/rw1881062/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,4," Not the worst ever, but far below expectations
","How the mighty have fallen! Spielberg, once the man who could do no wrong in Hollywood, has been on the wane for many years. Since the 1980s, his films have been getting worse and worse, but this is in every respect poorer than you'd hope for from the man whose last movie was the lacklustre WAR OF THE WORLDS remake. KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL is an self-indulgent fan boy's dream, a ludicrous, repetitive, and bloated mass packed with unappealing CGI effects and one of the worst scripts in recent history. I love the original INDIANA JONES trilogy, but this is similar to THE PHANTOM MENACE in that it helps tread the name of the series into the ground. No surprise that George Lucas had his greedy mitts on this one, either.",/review/rw1881062/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2008,Boba_Fett1138,8," No, it's not the best one out of the series but it's good quality entertainment on its own right.
","Of course if this wasn't a Spielberg movie and this wasn't the longest most anticipated movie sequel of all time and if the Indiana Jones character was a completely new one to the world, very little people would complain about this movie and actually without doubt call it one of the most entertaining movies of this decade. But no, understandably so, expectations for this movie were high and Indiana Jones is part of many people's childhood and when expectations are high, movies very rarely satisfy completely.",/review/rw1881062/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2008,tieman64,," Looks better on small screen
","""Crystal Skull"" begins with one of its best sequences. To the tune of Elvis Presley's ""Hound Dog"", a 1950's drag racer zooms alongside a military convoy. It's a zesty homage to Lucas' ""American Graffiti"", but it's also the only sequence in the film to pack a genuine sense of energy.",/review/rw1881062/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2022,nickenchuggets,6," The power of gods
","After almost 14 years, I have finally got around to watching this movie. Even though I was a fan of Indiana Jones at the time of its release, I pretended like this movie didn't exist because people were saying it is much worse compared to its 3 predecessors. After seeing it, I didn't think it was a total mess, but can definitely understand why some people felt this way. One thing I enjoy about this movie is how it takes place in the cold war. The nazis and cultists from the earlier movies have been replaced as the main antagonists by the Soviet Union. The movie starts in 1957, and a bunch of vehicles on a highway are closing in on Area 51 in Nevada. Russian undercover KGB personnel gun down the men guarding the base and take Indy (Harrison Ford) hostage, telling him that they want him to lead them to an alien corpse he already saw a decade earlier. The leader of the russian forces infiltrating Area 51 is Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), a tall and ruthless woman who wears a medieval rapier on her belt as a status symbol. After retrieving the crate containing the alien for the russians, Indy, and his friend Mac (who turns out to be working with the KGB for money) escape the warehouse. Jones makes his way to a nearby mock town in the Nevada desert, constructed to test the effects of nuclear blasts on an average US neighborhood. It is populated by mannequins, and the only car available drives off before picking up Jones right as a siren starts to sound. Somehow, Indy manages to survive an atomic explosion by clearing out a refrigerator and hiding in it. Eventually, Jones is interrogated by the FBI and accused of being a communist, which leads to him having to leave his job as a college teacher. A mid 20s kid in a leather jacket named ""Mutt"" Williams (Shia Labeouf) later finds Jones and informs him Professor Oxley, one of Jones' friends, has found a crystal skull in south america, but has also been taken prisoner. Williams and Jones fly to Peru in order to search for this artefact, which they eventually find at the grave site of a 500 year old conquistador named Francisco de Orellana. However, after trying to leave with the skull, the soviets are already aware of their plans and take them prisoner. At the camp Williams and Indy are taken to, Indy discovers that Marion (Karen Allen) of all people is there, and she's also Williams' mother. The last time she joined forces with Jones was back in the 30s. Meanwhile, Irina deduces that the crystal skull, due to its odd shape, must belong to some psychically advanced alien race, and if the USSR can find a way to harness their abilities, they can turn the world into their puppets. After a vehicle chase, Jones, Mac, and everyone else arrive at Akator's temple, which is supposed to hold treasures from many old civilizations. In one of its many chambers, Jones finds a bunch of blue crystal skeletons, with one of them missing its head. Irina shows up and puts aside her differences with Jones for just a moment in order to return the skull to its rightful place. Oxley speaks in mayan and says the aliens want to bestow something upon the group, that being knowledge. Irina says she wants to know everything the universe contains, and she is given so much knowledge to take in that she disintegrates. The temple is then rapidly torn to pieces by a rift that the aliens opened which leads back to their homeworld, but Indy and the others manage to get away (with the exception of Mac and the russians). A UFO then emerges from the ruins and zooms back to its planet at light speed. Finally, Jones officially marries Marion and is brought back to his college to work as dean. This movie is really strange. The most generic criticism I've heard on it is just that it doesn't really fit with the rest of the series, and I can understand why. There's an overabundance of CGI, ridiculous moments, and the inclusion of aliens in an Indy movie is just taking it too far for my liking. The film also has plenty of absurd moments to choose from that really destroy any sense of immersion very effectively, probably the most noticeable is when Indy manages to survive a nuke by hiding in a lead lined refrigerator. Even after the thing is blown hundreds of yards away by the force of the explosion, he exits it safe and sound. What if the fridge landed with the door facing the earth? Another scene has Indy fighting a russian colonel hand to hand near a waterfall while a massive swarm of ants horde around them. The colonel eventually falls into the endless pile of ants and is carried into their underground nest in only a matter of seconds. I don't know any ant species that is that strong. In the movie, they're described as Siafu, which are real life carnivorous ants that can devour something as large as a cow in days, but the ones shown here are way too strong. Not to mention, Siafu don't even live in south america. I thought the car scene at the beginning of the movie when they're all driving to Area 51 was kind of irritating, especially because Spielberg chose to play Hound Dog to let everyone in the audience know it's the 1950s. It was nice to see Marion back, but I thought it was stupid how the movie surprises everyone by telling us that Williams is actually Indy's son as well. I don't mean to beat a dead horse, but that is my ultimate assessment on this movie. It's good by ordinary movie standards, but not really a good Indiana Jones one. While it's true that it's technically the least best in the series, it was still an enjoyable (if unrealistic) experience.",/review/rw1881062/?ref_=tt_urv
