19 August 2016,grantss,7," Sweet, sensitive, thoughtful movie - so much better than I expected
","A retired 70-year-old widower, Ben (played by Robert De Niro), is bored with retired life. He applies to a be a senior intern at an online fashion retailer and gets the position. The founder of the company is Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), a tireless, driven, demanding, dynamic workaholic. Ben is made her intern, but this is a nominal role - she doesn't intend to give him work and it is just window dressing. However, Ben proves to be quite useful and, more than that, a source of support and wisdom.",/review/rw3318909/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2016,Hitchcoc,7," DeNiro Charms the Entire Cast
","Totally bored with life, Robert DeNiro's character seeks out a new career. He had worked out, traveled the world, read books, on and on. While he is relatively happy, he feels empty. He is seventy years old when he reads a flyer on a bulletin board. A rising company is looking for ""senior"" interns, that is, people who have had tons of experience who can be used as a kind of publicity stunt. Ann Hathaway is the wunderkind of a clothing company that has feasted on the Internet. DeNiro finds himself with no power, attached to Miss Hathaway, but doing no work. Eventually, by taking on some of the hard work and showing utter kindness, he manages to become quite the institution in the firm. His boss is trying to balance both her career and her marriage (and daughter). At some point, it is decided that she should hire a CEO and give power over to him/her. Soon DeNiro finds himself at the beck and call of Hathaway, becoming part of the family. This is a touching, but predictable effort. It's still a nice two hours and DeNiro steals every scene he is in.",/review/rw3318909/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2015,wembleyfm,7," Surprisingly Intern-resting!
","Without knowing too much about the plot, I assumed this was taking De Niro down a familiar trodden path of another ""Fokker"" type role. How wrong I was! This is a very endearing, gentle and easily watchable escapade that sees an ageing De Niro being given an internship with an e-commerce fashion company and becoming surprisingly useful at bestowing his considerable knowledge to his new colleagues. I can't remember ever seeing De Niro play such a likable role without seemingly any flaws to his character. Hathaway charms her way through the film and there's a nice cameo from Russo as a love interest. A film that doesn't try too hard to be funny and comes across better for it.",/review/rw3318909/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2015,moviexclusive,6," De Niro and Hathaway's chemistry is a sheer delight, but Nancy Meyers' distracted screenplay in the second hour undercuts an otherwise genuinely entertaining start
","As far as on screen pairings go, 'The Intern' boasts probably one of the most interesting ones in recent memory. On one hand is Robert De Niro's 70-year-old Ben Whittaker, presently struggling to deal with the concept of retirement; on the other is Anne Hathaway's 32-year-old Jules Ostin, the founder and CEO of a tremendously successful fashion-based e-commerce company called 'About the Fit' or 'ATF' for short' who is presently struggling to deal with the demands of her investors while not neglecting her six-year-old daughter and stay- home husband. Diametrically opposite as they may be, writer/ director Nancy Meyers wants to prove that these two individuals can have much more to learn from each other than you and I can imagine.",/review/rw3318909/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2017,TheLittleSongbird,6," Irresistible first half, clunky second half
","Love comedy/drama when done right, have liked some of Nancy Meyers' previous work, Robert De Niro at his best is one of the best actors of the latter half of the century (evidenced in 'Taxi Driver', 'Godfather Part II' and 'Raging Bull') and Anne Hathaway has also given good performances. So 'The Intern' seemed promising.",/review/rw3318909/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2016,SnoopyStyle,7," nice pairing
",Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) is a 70 year old Brooklyn widower and a retired executive from the phone company. His son's family lives out of town. He tries to fill his days of leisure. He spots a flyer advertising internships for senior citizens. It's a fast-paced fashion internet commerce site run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway). It's been a hectic 18 months for the married mother of little girl and she is reluctantly forced to use Ben as her assistant. Her husband Matt gave up his job to be the stay-at-home dad. Fiona (Rene Russo) is the company masseuse. Ben befriends everyone until Fiona starts to find him indispensable.,/review/rw3318909/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2020,MaryM14,8," Great concept!
","It's amazing how well this film captured the essence of being a millennial brand. The craziness, and hectic behind- the-scenes life of the online startups that we see pop in our Instagram feed daily. I actually love Anne Hathaway in this business woman roll. Also the movie will make you like Robert De Niro, as he plays a kind gentlemanly retiree. I never get to see De Niro in this type of roll (due to me usually not liking any movie he's in) but he's so admirable in this movie and I couldn't imagine anyone playing it better. I love how the movie shows some of the struggles and prejudice a female founder/CEO can face without portraying Anne's character as whiny or completely incapable of running her own company.",/review/rw3318909/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2015,Ricardo-36,5," Good premise, flawed execution
","The Intern is what I call a ""paint by the numbers"" film. It hits all the necessary notes for this sort of comedy but misses the point of what a movie is supposed to be, like a paint by the numbers painting misses the point of art. It's like a robot has got the premise, seen a lot of comedy/drama-ish feel good films like Driving Miss Daisy, Devil Wears Prada, etc, and decided to spit out a screenplay. It doesn't work, and what does work, is sustained by the actors performances.",/review/rw3318909/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2016,jimel98,7," Nice Story that's a bit predictable.
","OK, first and foremost, I'm sick of the pretentious a-holes who rush like sharks to a seal feeding area to condemn this type of movie. You blow hards go and make a few movies and THEN spout off your know it all garbage. GAWDALMIGHTY! OK, with that out of my system, this movie is a fairly predictable and pedestrian film. I have to be brutally honest however, a couple of small curve balls did surprise me, but overall, eh. Not a great movie but hey, a nice story. I use that word a lot, 'nice' and I've acknowledged that before. For some films, it's the best description. It's not exciting, it's not thought provoking and it's not intended to be. It's entertaining and at times, a bit uplifting. In a word, it's NICE! What the hell is wrong with nice? Not a damn thing. The whiney folks who feel every movie must have impact or teach a lesson or...what-have-you, are jerks, morons and probably failed film students who were rejected by EVERY movie studio, even the Troma Team. Let's be honest you egomaniacs, shall we? I'm just a guy who loves movies and in this movie I see a pleasant story that allowed me to sit for an hour and 1/2 and just enjoy a nice story. Is that so wrong? No, dammit, it isn't. Am I angry, yeah, I guess I am. Do I care if I offend a few douche bags? Hell no.",/review/rw3318909/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2015,RforFilm,6," The Intern is a cute, even likable story about how elders may know more then you think
","It seems that in todays working world, the intern is the new entry-level job. Even with the great recession almost over, the millennial generation faces a new world of hard debt and technological competition. They also face a high number of equally qualified candidates that are more then willing to work for wage, and even for nothing, for the hope that they may receive an offer for a better job within the company their working for. My second job was also an intern position that paid nothing in exchange for experience. I didn't stay with the company, but I learned a lot about working in the Hollywood industry and even in an office environment.",/review/rw3318909/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2018,Platypuschow,6," The Intern: Exceeded my expectations

25 September 2015,patsworld,9," The Intern is The Boss!
","Robert De Niro, as a retired 70 year old who re-enters the work force and proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that oldies are still goodies.also proves just why he is a star as he shines so bright in this movie as to be blinding. He is perfection. There are some actors that the older they get, the better they get, and De Niro is most certainly one. Anne Hathaway, as the genius behind a too-fast growing company is playing what I consider one of her best roles yet. And Rene Russo is still gorgeous as ever. I was impressed, also, by Anders Holm who played Hathaway's husband. But then, actually, I was impressed with everyone in this movie. There really wasn't a single thing or character I would change in this one, and that's saying something. The casting, the plot, the dialogueand fancy this, it was a funny, touching, enjoyable picture with NO foul language, NO overly-suggestive crude garbage that usually just makes the audience cringe. It was well written, well -acted, and well presented. All rare these days where just the writing ability seems to have dwindled into the dirt. This one is evidence that there are still writers and creators who have talent out there. More movie producers should make a point of seeking and finding them! This is a fun movie that you are going to be recommending to everyone within reading or hearing distance. One of the best films we've seen in some time and left us all smiling as we left the building.",/review/rw3318909/?ref_=tt_urv

28 September 2015,PWNYCNY,2," One big cliché.
","Did anyone involved in making this movie really believe that this movie is good? This movie is so shallow that it makes a puddle look like an ocean. The idea of mixing a pompously acting Robert De Niro with a hysterically acting Anne Hathaway is an example of how not generate on-screen chemistry. Not that the acting is bad. It's the story. It's one ongoing cliché. It is a combination of dull, boring, and contrived. It's Father Knows Best meets I Love Lucy, except in this case the characters take themselves seriously. This movie manages to take several important social themes and reduce them to pulp, and even worse, reduce the principal characters to clichés. A bored older retiree with nothing but time and a manic young business woman. C'mon! Not exactly the cutting edge of literary originality. And what is worse, they are not funny characters. The supporting cast is funny, but they are not the principal players. Now the story has potential. The movie actually starts strongly. The De Niro character is introduced and his issues clearly presented. Then the movie tanks, and tanks quickly. A promising start leads to a contrived story and muddled finale. This movie reaffirms the old movie maxim - never judge a movie by its coming attractions.",/review/rw3318909/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2016,Jerghal,5," A 2 hour long commercial
","The Intern is a perfect example of the soulless crap Hollywood dares to crank out. De Niro plays a retired 70 year old who is bored to death and therefore seeks to work for free as an intern for a booming e-commerce company run by Ann Hathaway. The film feels like one big fat commercial (and it actually is). At this hipster e-com company everyone works on Macs, Ann drives an Audi, she lives in a residential hipster house. She drinks Stella Artois beer (they make sure you see the label), brand names are also dropped (lego, Netflix), other products are also clearly visible; Starbucks, Sony, Skype, Samsung,.. Even the music sounds like music from a commercial (not joking!). Al these 'people' in the movie are the examples of successful hipsters and the 'problems' they have are just first world problems. I also could not stand the characters: all these conflict avoiding, apologetic, overly helpful nitwits. If you see De Niro playing this cardboard character (it's written that way, he tries his best with it) it's hard to believe this was the guy who played in Taxi Driver. The Intern is also so Politically Correct it's sickening. You can feel being manipulated while watching this garbage. It felt like these subliminal messages in They Live. People should not have paid to see this, they should have been paid to spend 2 hours being pounded by this extensive commercial marinated in a forced 'feel good' message.",/review/rw3318909/?ref_=tt_urv

17 September 2015,chaplinman13,8," Pretty funny, great story all can relate to no matter your age or sex. NOT a romance.
","I caught an advance screening of this last night. The theater was close to being packed with men, woman and children. The movie was surprisingly quite funny; didn't know anything about it before viewing. The entire theater ended up cracking up numerous times. There were various times I felt bad for De Niro's character, but he was optimistic and didn't let it effect him, so it was great. There were a couple of instances I would have never guessed things about the movie. There is one scenario in the story that is tough; what would you do if put in that circumstance. I believe ages 20-80 can relate to this movie. We had De Niro's aspect as well as Hathaway's. Good storyline. The ""Intern"" group of guys were funny too. I'd see this again.",/review/rw3318909/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2015,CleveMan66,8," ""The Intern"" entertains like a seasoned professional.
","Sometimes you don't need a film to try and change the world, make bold political or societal statements or even be shocking. Sometimes it's good enough to be an audience member who can just sit back, relax and enjoy the show and smile. That's the kind of movie you get when you sit down to enjoy ""The Intern"" (PG-13, 2:01).",/review/rw3318909/?ref_=tt_urv

24 September 2015,ferguson-6,6," Cuddly and Feel-Good with some Laughs
","Greetings again from the darkness. A feel-good mainstream movie featuring two big time movie stars will likely have box office success and cause a lot of people to laugh out loud. In other words, the latest from writer/director Nancy Meyers should be celebrated for its entertainment value, rather than picked apart by film critics.

15 March 2016,magnuslhad,1," vacuous
","You have to imagine Robert De Niro and Anne Hathaway have their pick of projects. They must have piles of scripts sent to them. And this is the one they choose to spend their time on? The only intrigue this film offers is pondering the 'why' of that question. An IT start up takes on senior citizen interns because... well, the reasons are never quite explained. The older guys mock 'tweets,' and not tucking your shirt in. The younger guys mock a lack of tech savvy. Among all this gentle (i.e. not funny) humour about generation gaps, a bawdy joke about an inappropriate erection appears. Then some bizarre break in and escape from the cops. Meanwhile, a successful woman will inevitably be betrayed by the man in her life, the narrative tells us. Trite, unreformed storyline with one-dimensional characters: what did this A-list cast see in the script? Does Nancy Meyers have incriminating negatives in a vault somewhere? Modern-day Hollywood genre filmmaking at its most putrid.",/review/rw3318909/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wonderful contemporary story, great acting. What more can one ask for? DeNiro totally inhabits the role of a bored NewYorker retiree who quietly, commandingly changes everyone around him for the better. There were little bits of sentimental predictability but not many. Nothing slowed the pace for long. It was lovely to see ageism front and center, blasted to smithereens! Subtle, believable performances that did not pander to the problems of aging, but acknowledged them. The boys ""road trip"" was hilarious. The ""boys"" themselves were presented as stereotypes but managed to imbue them with personality. There were some great laugh out loud moments! Nicely cast, well-written plot and characters. Go see it! Especially if you are over 60!",/review/rw3318909/?ref_=tt_urv
