6 February 2019,svhot,8," ""Honey Boy"" is powerful. A brave, bold portrayal of Shia Labeouf's real life trauma
","""Honey Boy"" is an honest, intense, bold, and powerful look at actor Shia Labeouf's problems which developed because of his abusive father, who was also his manager. Although Shia has given the name Otis to the movie's central character, there are more than enough clues and hints (given by him also as the movie's storywriter) to confirm the fact that it is Shia's story that is being portrayed in ""Honey Boy"".",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2020,Polarbear53041,10," I was wrong
","Always figured Shia Lebeouf was a decent actor, but nothing special. I was wrong. It's one of the best performances I've seen in years, and not just from Shia, it's shocking how good the entire cast is. See it.",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2019,ferguson-6,7," Shia's childhood
","Greetings again from the darkness. Most 12 year olds don't have a job. Perhaps their parents have assigned a few chores around the house to help them learn responsibility, but for the most part, they go to school and play ... the things that kids do. Shia LaBeouf had 2 jobs as a kid. He was a rising actor and he was employer/quasi-guardian of his father. Now in his 30's, LaBeouf has written a screenplay about his childhood and he stars as his father in an attempt to exorcise some personal demons. It also happens to make for compelling cinema.",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2020,soldadodechristos,9," Shia LaBeouf deserves an Oscar.
",He deserves an Oscar for writing it let alone for the acting. He truly is the most underrated actor out there now and the best of my generation. Noah Jupe is a tour de force. Lucas Hedges nails his portrayal of Shia LaBeouf.,/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2020,beckakins,10," Hit close to home
","Let me start by saying I am not an emotional person by any stretch. I dont think I have ever cried in front of my wife in the 15 years we have been together. This movie utterly destroyed me emotionally. I had to put up a blanket barrier between my head and my wife's as she slept for fear she would catch me sobbing like a little girl while watching this movie. This movie sucked me into a paradox of memories and emotions relating to the dynamic between me, my father, and my 3 children. It allowed me to put myself into the shoes of my children...and made me see very clearly for the first time in many years one thing. LOVE THOSE LITTLE ONES. HUG THEM, KISS THEM, LOOK THEM IN THE EYES AND TELL THEM HOW VERY MUCH YOU LOVE THEM. The years pass and before you know it, it's too late to make up for lost time. I wish I could thank Shaia for making this movie. It helped me more than any therapy session ever could.",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2019,kjproulx,10," One of the Most Necessary Movies of the Year
","From Even Stevens to Transformers, I've watched Shia Labeouf's career rapidly evolve and slowly wind down to how people view him today. Recognized as someone who may have let the fame get to his head, Honey Boy is a film that will show you why he was the way he was throughout certain moments in his life. Recently premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival and hitting theatres this Fall, here's why I believe Honey Boy is one of the best and most necessary movies of the year.",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2020,TechnicJunglist,8," Intense and bleak
",You've got to be in the right headspace for this type of drama or it could eat you up. That being said Honey Boy is a total accomplishment for Shia in all aspects of the word. Honestly when Holes & Transformers were around I was not a fan but over the last 10 years or so he has delivered incredible performances this being the most vulnerable in my opinion. The entire cast is amazing & shining a light on child stardom and the repercussions of that matters. We've seen this scenario play in Hollywood too many times. Maybe this will make a dent somehow and I look forward to seeing what comes next for Shia.,/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2019,subxerogravity,7," It's very real and very raw.
","It's a strange movie in a sense that Shia Lebeauf who wrote and starred in this picture is kinda saying thank you to his father for making him the man he is today, but the portrayal of his father is not the most favorable.
Movies do not get realer than this one. It holds nothing back and tells no lies it's just emotionally honest. I'll give it that. Shia's betrayal of that overbearing father was great and the movie overall is an excellent watch.",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2020,guerrilawarfare,9," Definitive Oscar Snub of 2020
","Most well acted movie I have seen in 2020. The direction, writing, and cinematography were all amazing. The fact that this is not nominated for a single Oscar is atrocious. How anyone could say Pitt or Hanks put in even close to the effort and performance Shia did is asinine.",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2019,rockman182,7," Honey Boy(2019)
","I for one, am fascinated by Shia LaBeouf. I'm sure I'm not the only one. He is a polarizing figure in Hollywood and I was amazed that this guy marathoned all of his films in the cinema. I think he is a wonderful actor as well, see The Peanut Butter Falcon and American Honey for proof. When I heard he was writing a memoir of sorts about the tumultuous relationship with his father, I was definitely going to go see it. This film was pretty much what I expected it to be.",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2019,icegirl-94721,10," Vulnerable
","To show others your life exsperiances, to be vulnerable its beautiful, and it connects us, which is what we all want in life, beautiful human connection. I'm grateful I was able to view this movie at the Sundance theater last night. I was too nervous to ask a question during the Q and A session after the movie but wanted to ask if they purposely chose to portray the modeling behavior between son and father. I recently went to a parenting class by @simplyonpurpose where they mentioned that 90% of the time a child is punished for repeating the same behaviors as their parents, only 10% of the time are children actually being disobedient. This movie did a wonderful job portraying that inevitably in a few very powerful scenes. Anyways parenting was obviously on my mind so perhaps I found what I wanted to see. We can't choose our parents or control their behaviors. We can only choose to be better, do better, love deeper and make an effort to model the type of behavior that will benefit our future generations. Love, empathy, healthy coping skills, how we treat others....Anyways I loved it! I found it very emotional and think it will connect with a wide range of audiences.",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2020,aidanratesmovies,10," The Most Underrated Film of 2019
","A bold, brilliant, and deeply personal drama, that hits closer to the hart than most films even dare to try. The performances are fantastic, with Shia LaBeouf, Noah Jupe, and Lucas Hedges providing the best of the films high class performances. The film doesn't just show the realities of show business and trauma, but lets us feel the pain being brought upon the character of Otis, which is both a daring, and impressive feat to match. The script is most brilliant in this way, as well as its use of dialogue and progression of plot and story. The pacing is excellent, and I was fully entertained all the way through. It can be a bit hard to watch, but it's also the point, and it illustrates it much clearer than most. The cinematography is excellent, with some shots in the film truly putting a grin on my face. In the end, Honey Boy is a great success and a fantastic semi-autobiography that gets its story right, and is truly the most underappreciated film of 2020.
My Rating: 10/10",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2020,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," Great biopic
","LaBeouf was great in putting this together in such short time after his last stint in rehab, and his acting was incredible. I just felt the story needed to emphasize some sections more and have a better start and ending. It reminded me of Mickey and the Bear, although I enjoyed that one better. Excellent directing and cinematography though.",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2019,paul-allaer,5," Feel-bad movie of the year (with apologies to Mr. LaBeouf)
","""Honey Boy"" (2019 release; 95 min.) brings the story of James and his son Otis. As the movie opens, it is ""2005"" and Otis works on a movie set. Later he drinks heavily and eventually gets in a car crash, resisting arrest and berating at the cops. He ends up at a rehabilitation camp, which can still turn into a 4 year prison term if he fails that camp. We then go to ""1995"", where 12 yr. old Otis is working on a movie set, and eventually goes home with his dad, home being a cheap motel near the 101 Freeway. We get to know James, who in no time becomes insufferable... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience.",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," Catharsis incarnate.
","'Honey Boy (2019)' is an, essentially, autobiographical account of Shia LaBeouf's strained relationship with his father and his attempts to overcome the resultant PTSD while in court-mandated rehab. The film was actually written during LaBeouf's stay in the previously mentioned clinic. In it, he portrays his own father. It's fair to say that it's an incredibly personal piece; you can practically feel the catharsis oozing from the screen. It's actually very satisfying, feeling almost like a form of medicine. Even though you don't know LaBeouf personally, it's difficult not to feel sort of proud of the guy. His performance as his own father is nothing short of fantastic. It's highly empathetic and feels like an effort to understand, rather than to destroy. The piece posits that the only road to recovery is forgiveness, which removes the generational anger that plagues cyclically abusive families. It makes distinct efforts, mainly via repeated motifs, to convey this theme across both of its time-periods. The direction is markedly good in general. It separates its stories via subtle changes in cinematography, often creating pseudo-surrealist sequences which wonderfully bridge the two. It's a considered effort, for sure. The final movement does occur a little quickly, as the movie seems to skip to its denouement whilst in the middle of its underplayed third act. Prior to this, there's no real sense of escalation, either. Still, these relatively small issues aren't all that detrimental. The performances are brilliant, the narrative is nicely balanced and the end-result is as engaging as it is affecting. It's catharsis incarnate. 7/10",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2019,brankovranjkovic,5," Honey Boy - Did this movie help to heal the pain?

19 February 2020,jtindahouse,7," LaBeouf proves he can do more than just act
","I love Shia LaBeouf, I really do. I'll watch basically anything he puts his name to. The man blew up his own career by being too honest, and I respect him immensely for that. I didn't actually realise going in to 'Honey Boy' that it was him telling a very personal and true story abut the relationship he had with his father. I worked it out very quickly though that that was what was being portrayed. It can't be easy to write a film like this, but LaBeouf does a terrific job of presenting how he perceived things, without ever feeling like he's trying to ram a point down your throat.",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv

30 March 2020,UniqueParticle,10," Riveting all around should've been nominated
","Shia Leboeuf should've been nominated for the screenplay and acting! Wildly entertaining throughout no wonder Honey Boy got praised. Beautiful cinematography that inspires me to wanna live in California rather than NC like other films, I don't know though I hear different things. Absolutely love the glossy colors in several parts! Heartbreaking the things Shia experienced; I'm sure not many knew about his life struggles. Highly recommend Honey Boy it's very well made and touching, some would consider it a tearjerker.",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2020,Cineanalyst,7," Circle of Cinema
","As a semi-autobiographical account of Shia LaBeouf's upbringing, ""Honey Boy"" is a vanity project, to be sure, but I like the doubled mirroring of filmmaking. As a person may be best equipped to examine themselves, which is what LaBeouf did in scripting and starring in this and what the character based on him does in his therapy sessions, some of the most intriguing movies are those that are likewise reflexive. This part seems more revelatory than that a family lineage of drug and other abuses would lead to a child star growing up with his own problems. Although, I think the direction, with the montage of pretty compositions--many of them involving a water pool--set to music to be more banal in its navel gazing than anything in the script, which is engaging enough in its seemingly honest reflection. By the age of 12, LaBeouf's screen surrogate, Otis, is already smoking tobacco and marijuana, witnessing his father's abuse of other drugs, being hit and otherwise mistreated by the man, and having a sexual affair with an adult--besides being a child celebrity and the family's breadwinner through his acting career.",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2020,kaneeddy,7," Strong performances and writing, a good film
","Honey Boy is a film I was fascinated by, with the way it was made and the subject matter behind it. The story of a young Shia Labeouf and the relationship with his father influencing him as an adult. The performances from Noah Jupe, Lucas Hedges and Shia Labeouf are fantastic, all giving committed performances that will draw out emotions, the direction from Alma Har'el was solid as well as Labeoufs writing, as it felt personal and gave us a glimpse into his life that he didn't need to show us, so I commend him on being brave enough to do that.",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2019,ThomasDrufke,7," Cinematic Therapy
","Honey Boy is probably a film you appreciate the craft of it more than you do the actual film itself. Shia LaBeouf is having perhaps the best year of his career with this and The Peanut Butter Falcon both getting awards buzz, and rightfully so. LaBeouf, who supposedly wrote the movie in a rehap stint, during the filming of the aforementioned The Peanut Butter Falcon, presents Honey Boy as a form of cinematic therapy while also opening the window for the audience into a potential life of a young hollywood actor providing for his/her family. If for nothing else, Honey Boy is one heck of an interesting story to tell, though it never truly packs the emotional gut punch that I hoped it might.",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2020,marmar-69780,6," honey boy
","Honey boy is personal told story about shia childhood and his troubled relationship with his father,story is simple told and it was impressive that shia wrote a pretty good script but that was probably easy for him since he only needed to visit his history,also opinion if you like or dislike film will depend how you feel of shia as person and actor,for me i wasnt big fan of his work before and i didnt know nothing about his history,but this film changed me a bit and i was able to understand him better now,honey boy isnt the best film of that year but for autobiography it was solid told and written with some noticable acting expecely kid who played young shia",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2019,Hopedoesnotdie,10," Great movie
","The performances are really raw and honest and they really go there. The movie had my attention the entire time and the cinematography and direction is wonderful too. I hadn't been a LaBeouf fan because I as an actor myself.. I am always disappointed because I work so hard and it's hard to get a paying acting job when other actors seem to get arrested and drink and do drugs and are constantly getting hired. However, his performance in Peanut Butter Falcon gave me a new window into his ability as an actor and this movie gave me newfound respect for him and hearing him speak of the film and the process really resonated with me as an actor. I never had a parent pushing me to do it and always felt alone in the business but the character of Otis has a father pushing him and he is as alone and broken as ever. If you want to see a film where the actors really listen to each other and take risks- this is it! Oh an Lucas was great too.",/review/rw5215989/?ref_=tt_urv
