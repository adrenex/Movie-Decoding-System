17 June 2022,dfloro,9," Character actors or movie stars? Whatever they are, they're at the top of their game
","In 6 months, Jeff Bridges will turn 73 years old. Indeed, he is an old man. His character makes those grunting noises from the effort of arising in the morning, and you also overhear a very sporadic urine stream in the middle of the night. Starting in Peter Bogdanovich's seminal ""The Last Picture Show,"" Bridges continued to build an enviable career out of numerous carefully drawn roles, each one truly unique and most of them more memorable than the last. He was finally awarded his long overdue Best Actor Oscar for ""Crazy Heart"" a few years ago, and then last year we almost lost him because of CoVID-19. But he's back as a beat-up old ex-spy and is perfect for and in this latest complex part.",/review/rw8245954/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,8," Entertaining (Love the Dogs)
","I was really looking forward to watching The Old Man ever since I saw the first trailer trailer. I'm a fan of spy thrillers and Jeff Bridges so I had high expectations going in. Well, it not only met those expectations but exceeded them in every way. The acting, writing, directing, etc. Are all as good as it gets, FX always puts out great content and this show is no different. The only bad thing about this show is we have to wait a week between episodes, I wish they released all them at once like they do on Netflix but since it's on Network tv I get it. Binge watching has ruined me because I just hate waiting a week between episodes now. I'm definitely looking forward to season two of this and just hope it continues to be as good as this season was.",/review/rw8245954/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,8," Solid Spy Series!
","The Old Man is a spy thriller that is absolutely worth watching! Jeff Bridges is as terrific as always and does an incredible job making you believe he's still a bad ass at 72! His dogs steal every scene they're in and remind me of the dogs from John Wick. The rest of the cast all are at the top of their game here too, especially John Lithgow (who rarely disappoints). I know there are a lot of really good spy shows out there to choose from but this has everything you want from a spy thriller and should definitely be seen. I'm really looking forward to more and recommend this to anyone who's a fan of spy thrillers.",/review/rw8245954/?ref_=tt_urv

23 July 2022,julieshotmail,6," Dialogue theatrics didn't cut it in the end
","""The Old Man"" begins like a mysterious poem, backed by the acting powerhouses of Jeff Bridges, John Lithgow, and those beautiful Rottweilers. We hear some eloquent dialogue and get treated to impressive long-cut scenes like the 5-minute smackdown between the 72-year-old Bridges and a young actor in episode 1. The show is captivating and we want more by episode 3. Unfortunately the dialogue theatrics become roundabout ramblings testing our patience. In the end, the answers fall flat and are anti-climactic, making it unnecessary for the show to take so long to get to the point. Other things introduced ultimately also become unnecessary such as the Zoe character. Yes, she injects some sass, mystery, and drama, but ultimately she is discarded and you realize that the main storyline could still get on without her, and all of those episodes with her are just a waste of time.",/review/rw8245954/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2022,bheadher,9," Love the dogs!!
","There is very little not to like about this series really...between Jeff Bridges and John Lithgow we have a winner here. I'm not sure where the SciFi comes in yet, but the intrigue and mystery have me on the edge of my seat. Frankly, whoever did the writing is a genius...",/review/rw8245954/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,UniqueParticle,10," Jeff Bridges is 72 years old and never ceases to be amazing!
","Very well directed by Jon Watts the director of recent Spider-Man trilogy and a horror movie called Clown all of which are excellent too! The Old Man starts off gloriously with the acting, intriguing story and suspense are so good. I'm ready for more maybe without commercials though.",/review/rw8245954/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2022,robfollower,9," Superb acting and Writing
","The first two episodes are superb. So far the casting is excellent in the series s The style of acting is very well done by the seasoned Pros Jeff Bridges is fantastic in The Old Man, as is John Lithgow. Amy Frederica Brenneman was what this shows needs; an air of mystery in her character Amy brings it just like she did in HBO's The Leftovers. Her sense of vulnerability play so well with Jeff Bridges even when Jeff wants to get the ""hell out of dodge"" he is drawn to Zoe McDonald, Amy character there is real chemistry as the two actor play off one another. The Old Man has extremely intelligent writing being raised up by the talent of The Ensemble. This thriller is going in some intriguing directions , I am very keen to watch how this series unfolds ! This is excellent network television . I cant wait till next episode ! Premiere episodes 8/10.",/review/rw8245954/?ref_=tt_urv

","I almost quit 3x before finally finishing The Old Man (after episodes 3, 4 & 6). Honestly, the ending was so bad (a twist telegraphed since the start, but -so- poorly executed) I would've rated it higher if I DID cut out early...",/review/rw8245954/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,lee_eisenberg,10," you can run, but you can't hide
","Jeff Bridges is one actor on whom I count to always do a fine job, and he doesn't disappoint in the miniseries ""The Old Man"", playing a retired CIA agent whose past catches up with him. I haven't read the book on which it's based, but I'd like to. Overall, the miniseries draws attention to the Soviet Union's 1980s occupation of Afghanistan, and the US's subsequent occupation (which inevitably ended in the Taliban's takeover of the country and repression of women).",/review/rw8245954/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,sbc-61818,9," I love where this is going, Season Two Please?
","Above and beyond any other review I can compose about The Old Man (2022) is that Alia Shawkat can act. This young lady could carry a series on her own. Having seasoned veterans along for the ride like Jeff Bridges, John Lithgow, and Amy Brenneman fills this out nicely. As a more seasoned citizen that I care to admit, every time Dan Chase wins in another unlikely situation I feel a little vicarious success. Season One of The Old Man has a lot going for it in terms of a solid story line, an amazing way of rolling the story out with the well acted and spaced flashbacks. Above all else, I want them to continue this series so we can see how many times who The Old Man that the title is referring to actually is. Thus far, we have had my guess for who that title roll actually is change as we discover more. In Order Dan is the solidly the title character until Harold takes over. Then in a phone call or two Morgan takes over the title roll. Things bounce back a forth until we find Faraz in that title roll drivers seat. This makes a great series as the story gets deeper and deeper. I am anxiously awaiting HULU's release of season two of this gem.",/review/rw8245954/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,oleingenaess,10," A true masterpiece
","The best tv-series I've seen in decades. Finally a series with substance and not just explotions, a lot of noise and animated effects. Totally free from superheroes, swords & axes, disasters and nature catastrophies. A great script reminding us about classic spy thrillers with great twists and turns, without anytime getting predictable. In my opinion the series is perfect paced with action and drama scenes, never making it boring to watch, and never going «over the top». Add some fantastic cinematography and some faboulous acting by Jeff Bridges, and you certainly have a true masterpiece of a series.",/review/rw8245954/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2022,gerardmartin77,5," Not bad
",Its not half as clever as it thinks it is . The show is entertaining but why does everybody talk in riddles ? Its hilarious. People don't talk in those kind of sentences. You feel like shouting at the screen ' can you just get to the point ? Please ? '. And some of the meetings and character development is just so unbelievable.

1 July 2022,vaughanstarr,3," Crashes and burns at the end of ep 4
","There is much to love about this show. Both Jeff Bridges and John Lithgow shine. The Amy Brenneman character of Zoe though...why? Just, why? Completely uninteresting in background and wholly superfluous to the narrative, by the end of episode 4 she becomes delusional and putrid. The story could have killed her off and most of the audience would have been left relieved that the show could continue on at a high level. As it is I am done. Another potentially great show ruined by utterly stupid choices.",/review/rw8245954/?ref_=tt_urv

3 July 2022,TheTruthofItIs,2," You will become an old man sitting through this snoozer
","""The Old Man"" (S01, 7 eps, >= 1-hr, FX) tells us of an old former CIA dude, 70+, who's been living ""underground"" since he ""retired"" but an old score to settle makes him go on the run again. The nut of the story is decent but like so many Covid-era productions, it dies in execution. The pacing is WAAYYYY too slow with many of the episodes a full 90-mins long! You will turn into an old man just trying to stay with it. Also, there are too many implausibilities, the main being that this ancient senior is whooping trained assassins 40 years younger! Please. This is as bad as shows/movies having 105 lb dainty girls whooping men twice their size, ridiculously unrealistic fight fantasy. Moving onto something else...",/review/rw8245954/?ref_=tt_urv
