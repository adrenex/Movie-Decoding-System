25 June 2005,BrianDanaCamp,," GODZILLA FINAL WARS: The Big G goes out with a big bang
","GODZILLA FINAL WARS may not please Godzilla purists but it delivers the goods for everybody else, -at least those with some knowledge of Godzilla lore. I saw it with a packed house of G fans at Subway Cinema's annual New York Asian Film Festival and it was the perfect audience for a film as steeped in the kaiju mythos as this one. Every time a new monster appeared on screen the crowd applauded or, rather, they applauded once that monster became recognizable, since the director often teases us with quick cuts and blurry motion before giving us a good, steady full-body shot. There are 15 monsters in all, many friendly old faces and some obscure ones, but all recognizable to longtime Godzilla fans.",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2005,Rob_Taylor,7," Pretty good updated version of the old classic movies.
","Toho got a lot of things right with this film. For a start (for me, at least) they maintained the feel of the old Godzilla flicks quite nicely. Next, even though the movie does have quite a bit of CGI, they stuck, for the most part, with men in suits for the monsters and miniature landscapes for them to destroy.",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2005,damonfoster,," Great, but Overkill
","My favorite Godzilla movie since TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA (Toho; 1975)! Since 2000, I felt the series was a string of indistinguishable films. I was also never impressed by the 'heisei' or post-GODZILLA 1985 series. So for better or worse, GODZILLA: FINAL WARS stands out. It tends to emulate the more over-the-top Godzilla movies of the 1970s, which I certainly don't mind. Instead of following the exact same pattern as all of GODZILLA 2000's (Toho; 2000) predecessors, GODZILLA: FINAL WARS takes a more creative approach and swipes ideas from THE MATRIX (Silver Pictures; 1999), all them X-Men comic books, and spatterings of typical Japanese TV hero stuff. While all these mixed genres may not play off each other perfectly and we have a mess of a film at times, at least we've finally got a Godzilla movie that actually stands out from the rest (I think the only other stand out film is 1971's GODZILLA VS. THE SMOG MONSTER).",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2011,kevinxirau,7," Godzilla goes out with a bang!
","Godzilla has had a good long run with a few bumps in the way and now it's time for him to take another break. For his 50th birthday, Toho Co. decided do something for the monster king and what they did was send him to an explosive farewell party. Was it worth it? For the most part, yes. Let's stomp our way in.",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2005,conor_kiley,8," Surprising Godzilla movie
",A very unusual Godzilla film.,/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2005,UberNoodle,5," A Fun film that makes no excuses for being what it is!
","First, before my review, I have address two points of contention about this film. For starters, the hero (Ozaki), besides having short black hair, black clothes and martial arts skills, no more resembles Keanu Reeves, than a brick resembles a prime-mover. His clothes may have similar pigmentation to the Matrix's Neo but in this film Ozaki is actually wearing white plastic body armour, and his military coat is dark green. Both he and Neo might share martial-arts knowledge. At least Ozaki is from the country that invented a large portion of it! Besides, I thought he looked MUCH more like Noah Wyle. If his coat had been white, perhaps people would say the film was ripping off ER.",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2006,dee.reid,10," ""Final Wars"" - A walk out into the sunset for Godzilla
","Welcome to ""Godzilla: Final Wars."" Now this is what a Japanese kaiju-eiga film should be. The plot is utterly ridiculous (taking its cues from literally hundreds of martial arts movies, 1999's ""The Matrix,"" past G-films, and even the maligned American version of Godzilla) and rolls it all into one big monster bash. It's a party where everybody is invited, even those here in America can be in on the fun.",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2013,claudio_carvalho,4," Cheesy and Long Mess with Lame Special Effects
","When the aliens Xilians invade Earth, they release monsters to destroy the big cities. The Earth Defense Force formed by mutants is incapable to defeat the creatures. Commander Douglas Gordon (Don Frye) decides to unleash Godzilla that has been trapped for many years to fight against the monsters. Godzilla becomes the last hope on Earth to vanquish the evil aliens and the powerful Gigan. ",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2005,Newski_the_Hippie,," A fitting end
","If this is the last Godzilla as said, then I can say the series had a good run and ended on a high note. Perhaps not the highest note possible, this is a very flawed film. However, it is the second best in the Millennium series (next to Megaguiras).",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2012,Pumpkin_Man,8," An Epic 50th Birthday Bash!!!
","I'm new to the Godzilla series, and I thought this was epicly awesome! It takes an hour to bring Godzilla in the movie, but the pay-off is definitely worth it! There's aliens, action, fighting, shooting, martial arts, monsters and the King of Monsters himself; Godzilla! It's an absolute blast. An organization called the Earth Defense Force (EDF) is created to protect the planet. They freeze Godzilla, but must soon deal with an alien invasion. The aliens control Anguirus, Rodan, King Caesar, Kamacuras, Monster X and many more. Earth's final chance of survival is Godzilla. If you love monsters and mind-numbing action, you'll love GODZILLA: FINAL WARS!!!",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2019,paul_haakonsen,6," A wholesome Godzilla movie actually...
","The 2004 movie ""Gojira: Fainaru u√¥zu"" (aka ""Godzilla: Final Wars"") wasn't actually all that bad, and it was definitely in the ranks of one of the better movies in the franchise for some time.",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2007,kosmasp,7," Didn't like the US Godzilla/Gojira?
","Neither did the makers of this movie ... that's why they took the US-Godzilla ""for a ride here""! But that's not the only creature from the Gojira/Godzilla past that is brought back. I don't if every creature is on display here, that was in a previous movie, but there quite a few of them. So if you know your Gojira movies, you'll have plenty to enjoy from those ""cameos"" alone!

16 May 2009,gigan-92,7," A G-Film Not Worthy of Being the Last
","For Godzilla's 50th anniversary, the final film before his latest hiatus, I have mixed views. On one side is the film itself which admittedly could use a little work but isn't too bad, but then again you have to remember that this film is the last and should be a work of art, like ""GMK"" and ""Tokyo S.O.S."". This is not the case.",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2007,OllieSuave-007,5," One Big Monster Splash!
","This is the final Godzilla film of the Millennium series, and is supposed to be the final one for at least a decade. Like most of the Godzilla movies in the series, this feature has no continuity and is supposedly not related to any of the other movies in the series. ",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2004,RAND0,," Wow
",I think there is a tendency with hardcore Kaiju fans to forget that these movies should not be taken so seriously. They are never executed to perfection. There are always plot holes. There is always some sub-par acting. Some of the special effects always look a little weak. Get over it.,/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2005,JermaineWarfare,10," A going away party worthy of a king!
","Somewhere between 1954 and today, Godzilla lost his meaning. Originally a symbol of nuclear destruction, foreboding and terrifying, Godzilla has played a number of roles, such as hero, villain, father, and everything in between. So it's only fitting that on his 50th birthday, and his retirement party, he gets to be a little of everything and pretend he's nothing all at the same time.",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2004,ehomenick,7," A mixed bag.
","I attended the world premiere of GODZILLA: FINAL WARS in Hollywood tonight, and I must say the experience was incredibly exciting. The film itself, however, was indeed a ""mixed bag"" of greatness and mediocrity, and I left Grauman's Chinese Theater a bit conflicted.",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2018,SimonJack,3," A dull monster circus, with special effects mayhem
","This last sequel of the Japanese ToHo films of Godzilla should nail the coffin shut on the Godzilla franchise. The first film was a mysterious, scary, monster movie that kept audiences riveted to their theater seats (in the mid-1950s). This latest sequel has deteriorated to a circus display of multiple monsters with zero fright factor. ",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2011,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,7," Godzilla: Final Wars (2004)
","50th anniversary and last film for at least a decade. This movie really does have it all. That is also its biggest flaw, but still. We have mutant humans, aliens are back, and almost every monster that has ever graced the cinematic screen. The world has united to help fight monsters, which seem to appear all the time. This really goes back to the trashier, but no less fun, entries from the 70's. It was great to see so many monsters, though some of them are dispensed with much too quickly. That was OK in the case of the films major highlight, seeing Godzilla take on Zilla, a monster that looks like the 1998 Hollywood Godzilla. It was a nice little touch for the fans. The film does try too hard to be a bit of everything, such as having a subplot involving a young boy, his grandfather and Minilla, which really goes nowhere. With so many monsters, there is also not much human interaction. This is certainly a great entry in terms of fun.",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2014,brando647,8," My Favorite Godzilla Film
","After having trudged through a handful of Godzilla movies and only really finding enjoyment in one (TOKYO S.O.S.), I think I've finally found what is safe to say my favorite: FINAL WARS. Based on the mixed critical and audiences reactions as compared to some of the other classics, I might be totally off-base and my opinion is probably skewed as I've only seen five or six movies in the franchise at this point. Regardless, this movie was more fun (despite its flaws) than any of the others I've seen. It was released on the 50th anniversary of the Godzilla franchise and, as I understand it, is touted as the last in the series. I assume this movie is just the same as any other with the word 'final' in the title and, if there haven't been more released yet, I'm sure we'll see more eventually (not including the 2014 American reimagining). The film opens with a battle against Godzilla in Antarctica where the military manages to trap him beneath a layer of rubble and ice. For a while, the world prospers as mankind has shifted its focus off of war and pollution. Everything's groovy until the world comes under attack from every major kaiju¬Öat once! Anguirus is in Shanghai! Rodan's in New York City! The monster from that horrible 1998 GODZILLA film starring Matthew Broderick is in Sydney, Australia! But wait! A race of aliens from outer space (I hate how the film always feels the need to refer to it as 'outer' space¬Öit sounds juvenile) known as the Xiliens have arrived to save us, and a new era of prosperity is upon us when they make quick work of the world's most dangerous monsters and offer to assist us in destroying a rogue planetoid on a collision course with Earth. It all sounds too perfect and the world welcomes the Xiliens with open arms, but there is something more sinister going on behind the scenes and mankind's survivors might need to awaken the world's most dangerous foe to save us: Godzilla.",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2006,ebiros2,6," This is More Like It
","The story of ""Godzilla Final Wars"" is like ""Godzilla Vs. Monster Zero"", ""Independence Day"", and ""Matrix"" rolled into one. An alien from Planet X comes to earth pretending to warn earth people about the danger of planetoid Golath which will be impacting earth in 11000 hrs. They also remove monsters that are on rampage in several cities around the world. But of course this is all just a show to win favors from the earthlings. They are secretly out to destroy civilization and transform earth people into human cattle. Earth has seen birth of mutants which have special powers. They all have the same ""M"" gene that people from planet X has. Ozaki (Masahiro Matsuoka) is one of them, and like Neo in Matrix, he's the only mutant who's powerful enough to beat the Planet X invasion force leader (Kazuki Kitamura). Earth's last chance to save itself is the core Earth Defence Force team on Gotengo (Atragon), and Godzilla who's kept in hibernation. Gotengo goes on a mission to wake Godzilla up and confront all the monsters under the influence of Planet X leader and destroy their mother ship.",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2005,ChadKuhns,," A Return to Form for Godzilla, A Depature For The Series
","For those who love to see Godzilla as the true, unstoppable King of Monsters, GFW is a true return to form. Godzilla has never seemed stronger, or been portrayed as more of a force to be reckoned with. However, it is this, and only this that seems to find familiar ground with the rest of the series.",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2006,winner55,10," big showy sci-fi film with silly rubber monster suits (& Japanese VERSION IS BETTER)
","NOTE 3/09: Just saw original Japanese version (available at Blockbusters); it is far better than the version I saw 3 years ago - not computer-compressed, so better pace & greater details visually, better color, dialog makes more sense, scene at beginning restored (as well as important snippets in the action sequences) - just better over all than American version you're likely to buy at a store. Original review follows:",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2006,zsanctuary,10," Big, loud and cheesy as hell...I wouldn't change a thing.
","Fifty years ago Toho made their first Godzilla movie. It was a very dark and symbolic movie. Despite its age the film still has an eerie quality to it. Godzilla slowly marching through Tokyo leaving nothing but death and destruction to this day sends shivers down my spine. This fantastic film was the first of 28 movies to feature the monster Godzilla. The thing is, over the years Godzilla movies have become a genre of their own. No longer are they dark or violent, rather they are fun and cheesy. This has somehow worked for fifty years and Godzilla is now cemented as a cultural icon.",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2007,TheUnknown837-1,3," my hopes for a good 50-year mark of the epic saga drowned when I finished watching this
","The Godzilla series has taken many turns and twists since the first of many sequels to come, ""Godzilla Raids Again"" was spawned in 1955. Over the course of fifty years, the series has been put on hiatus on three occasions. The first ""ending"" titled ""Terror of MechaGodzilla"" was a mediocre Godzilla film. It was the last time Godzilla was exploited as a hero and ended as strictly okay. The second ending, ""Godzilla vs. Destoroyah"" had the monster's demise at the end in a truly heart-breaking manner and the second ending was a very suiting one. No reason to end the series forever, but it was suitable.",/review/rw1688810/?ref_=tt_urv
