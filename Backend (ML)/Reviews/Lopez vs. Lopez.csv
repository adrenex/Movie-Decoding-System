29 May 2011,drozzee,7," Judge fair, keep it real.
","First i would like to comment on all the people who gives grades like 1 or 10, try and be a little realistic please. Its freaking annoying that people really cant see how this scale is working. Look at the top 250 and at the bottom 100 .. Now that is amazing movies or just plain horrible movies. If you don't feel you got what you wanted out of this movie then maybe your expectation's was to high. Godfather, Fight Club etc, those are movies that deserve a solid 9 or 10. Diary of a cannibal, Dream Well thats movies that deserve a solid 1 or 2. So stop your pessimistic crap about how bad this movie is and rate 1. No one can ever say that this movie is worse then any on the bottom 100. Ihave personally watched 1000+ movies so i find my self quite knowledge about a good movie or not, and this is not a great movie, but you get solid mindless action movie with decent graphic and a good acting crew. It gets a little long but again, no one cheats you in this movie. No one said to you before you watched it that it was movie of the year. You have a trailer and you build your own expectations. Give it a honest chance and stop judging it like it was a episode ""bad"" episode of jersey shore or its a 8th wonder of the world. Just judge fair for gods sake. ",/review/rw2397164/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2011,jurasic5000,8," Battle: LA, a close to reality war experience with aliens.
","Forget what critic (others) says. This movie is enjoyable. Battle LA is one of the finest alien invasion movie. This movie is a third person view of a group of US marines getting their way out of the city invaded by Aliens. Battle LA is a modern combat war experience, no drama no bullshit. It sticks to the reality. Thats where audience lost the point, they expected another pop corn movie like Independence day/2012. But I do agree the movie lacks in some parts which prevents it becoming a great movie.",/review/rw2397164/?ref_=tt_urv

12 March 2011,rparham,6," A familiar tale with a bit of a stylistic twist
","The alien invasion film is certainly nothing original. Recently, and upcoming, I can think of no less than 4 film and TV versions of this basic tale. Battle: Los Angeles doesn't bring anything new, plot wise, to this scenario. In fact, it operates on the thinnest of plot and some very underdeveloped characters. The only somewhat unique aspect, at least for an alien invasion story, is its gritty ""you are there"" aspect, filmed in a hand-held, jerky, thick of the action style. This isn't revolutionary either, but Battle: Los Angeles does manage to squeeze some momentum out of its running length.",/review/rw2397164/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2013,Theo Robertson,5," Did The Aliens Exterminate The Editor ?
",Everyone described this film as BLACK HAWK DOWN meets ALIENS and who am I to contradict public opinion . One thing I didn't notice in the reviews was similarity to the John Wyndham novel The Kraken Wakes . Meteors land in the ocean and very quickly alien incursions attack the coastline . One criticism of Wyndham's criminally underrated novel is that if an alien race was this advanced then there's no reason for them to be hostile down to evolutionary psychology . In simplistic terms a civilization alien or otherwise would have to evolve beyond petty tribalsitic squabbles and pool their resources in to conquering physics and mastering interstellar travel . In other words an advanced civilization should in theory be a non aggressive race not bent on conquest ,/review/rw2397164/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2011,Jharrison-22,7," Black Hawk Down... with Aliens
","I saw this film the other day, and I actually really liked it. It was exactly what I expected (maybe a little better). If you want to watch a really well thought out film with lots of character development and interesting subplots this is not the film for you. If you want to watch a bunch of U.S. Marines beat the tar out of invading spacefreaks, then this is the film for you. From when we first encounter the aliens to sometime in the middle, the movie is a nonstop thrill ride. Stuff explodes, aliens get splattered, humans get burned by lasers. In case you didn't already suspect, this film is very violent. Although there isn't a lot of blood, there are certainly a lot of deaths. The action is unpredictable and zany. One minute everyone will be walking somewhere between point A and B, the next, they're crouching behind burned out cars and houses as aliens pour ungodly hellfire onto them from above. The special effects were also quite good, with the exception of a couple bad animations here and there. That being said, the movie suffers when it slows down. The dialogue is poorly written, and delivered decently, but not well. Aaron Eckhart however did a wonderful job as a stony faced marine staff sergeant who keeps a cool head when under fire. Most of the storyline is pretty standard war movie/alien invasion stuff. You know, when after a bunch of fighting everyone gets discouraged and then the leader gives a big motivational speech and the inspirational music plays and everyone feels heroic.

11 March 2011,garethvk,7," Nothing new but a solid adventure.
","War movies depicting a group of soldiers against overwhelming odds are nothing new. For generations, moviegoers have been treated to cinematic recreations as well as new scenarios of fighting units in combat. Usually these films follow a typical formula that includes the tough and gritty commanding officer, the naive new soldier, the one with a woman and children waiting at home, and one who has difficulties with combat. In the new movie Battle: Los Angeles a new twist is given to the formulaic troops-in-combat picture which produces a mixed bag of results.",/review/rw2397164/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2011,blacklist-1,7," A solid action adventure that delivered what I expected.
","Battle: Los Angeles is a cross between Cloverfield (hand-held camera) and Independence Day (aliens landing on earth). It stars Aaron Eckhart as Staff Seargant Michael Nantz who having lost his platoon on a previous assignment files paperwork to leave active service for a while, but a call that meteors are landing all around the globe, which turns out to be aliens throws him back into the mix. The aliens want to eradicate the human colony for the resources of water, which helps in some way (it's never properly explained) to power their ships and mechanical bodies. Nantz becomes part of a new platoon who includes second lieutenant William Martinez (Ramon Rodrigeuz), Cpl. Jason Lockett (Cory Hardict), Cpl. Nick Stavrou (Gino Anthony Pesci), Cpl. Kevin Harris (Ne-yo surprisingly, whom I didn't even recognise until his name flashed up on the credits!) and TSgt Elena Santos (Michelle Rodriguez). They go to rescue any civilians in Santa Monica who are trapped in a police station and escort them out where also they find where the command module of the aliens ships that controls everything is and try to destroy it.",/review/rw2397164/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2011,TheLittleSongbird,3," Over-edited and under-directed, complete with cheesy dialogue, clichéd characters and weak story and acting- sorry I did not like it
","I watch films of all genres, old and new, good and bad, and while I wasn't completely taken with the idea of Battle:Los Angeles I was interested in seeing it. Unfortunately I didn't like it. I will get the good things out of the way first, the CGI is of decent standard, the bridge siege set-piece is fairly impressive and Aaron Eckhart does try hard, in the beginning he is the best asset of the film portraying the only likable character, even if he is rather clichéd.",/review/rw2397164/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2011,Likes_Ninjas90,1," This is an unoriginal, primitive and mindless recruitment video for the Call of Duty and MTV Generation
","Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) is an ageing soldier who is set for retirement. In his previous tour of Iraq he was one of the only survivors in his unit and speculation surrounds what happened to his men. When an alien invasion strikes the Earth however, he is brought back into the action to help lead a group of young and inexperienced soldiers. One of them is set to be married and another is expecting the birth of his child. As the rest of the Earth seems to be defeated, Los Angeles remains as one of the last posts. With the help of some civilians including a father and son, a veterinarian (Bridget Moynahan) and also TSgt. Elena Santos (Michelle Rodriguez), the unit works to clear out the city, moving towards an extraction point, before the area can be bombed out. ",/review/rw2397164/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2011,rgkarim,8," Battle LA: All action and war
","Okay this is not a movie about story, but surely it's obvious to see that in the trailers. This movie is about taking a location that is not really used for anything except soap operas and chick flicks and turning it into a battlefield. If you can cope with that then this movie isn't awful like a lot of people are saying. This movie has a lot of strengths for action lovers. The marines jump right into the fray within the first fifteen minutes or so and the action continues to pour in throughout most of the movie. Firefights, marine maneuvers, communication and motions, and actual strategies are incorporated into this movie, which was the director's goal in this project. Yes, there are some obvious solutions to the problem, aka nuke the zone, but then that wouldn't be a really long movie would it? Continuing on, another key factor that is seen is the brotherhood that soldiers have between their own platoon and the friendships that they make. Combine that with the action and you get the suspense that makes you connect with the characters hoping each one survives. Heck you may even pick a favorite character to root for in hopes they survive. Another strong point is that the movie keeps going, with very little slow scenes in the mix, so again action lovers will love it. Yes it kind of causes the story line to be narrowed out, but again you shouldn't expect a story from this kind of movie. ",/review/rw2397164/?ref_=tt_urv

","Battle: Los Angeles finds Marine Staff Sergeant Aaron Eckhardt ready to call it a career in the USMC. But an alien invasion that is disguised somewhat as a meteor shower upsets those plans. The aliens that are invading are not warrior Klingons or logical Vulcans, in fact they're really ugly and use our own sea water as fuel for their weapons. ",/review/rw2397164/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2012,Scarecrow-88,7," Battle:Los Angeles
","I had read considerable amounts of negative reviews for ""Battle: Los Angeles"" so my expectations were practically nonexistent. So consider me quite surprised at how much I actually enjoyed this sci-fi war epic. This is most definitely a patriotic pro-soldier kind of action picture shot in the style of ""The Hurt Locker"", hand held and constantly in motion, with lots of building/structure destruction and ammunition fire. Aaron Eckhart really is an actor who deserves more recognition; the guy is just a dependable actor (and he has those rugged ""Marlboro Man"" looks that also benefits him) who was born to play the part of a leading staff sergeant, a leader of men. He secures a resolve even when some of the Marines question his skills as a leader after a nasty incident which resulted in his entire platoon's demise (one in Eckhart's new troop had a brother who died in that incident), and eventually proves to them that he is worthy of their respect and admiration in the field. Essentially, ""Battle: Los Angeles"" has alien invaders (wanting to colonize Earth) as the terrorists, all the world's major cities specific targets. In this film, Los Angeles, particularly Santa Monica at the start, is the primary focus of the invasion. Eckhart's men (eventually including civilians found in a hospital, and Air Force soldier Michelle Rodriguez, who shows up in every high-scale action film imaginable it seems these days) make their way through the debris and rubble of what once was LA. We see neighborhoods decimated, bodies all over the place along with damaged cars, death and destruction proof positive that the invaders (who have ""drone ships"" in the air along with ""troops"" on the ground) have superior weaponry in comparison to the US military. It will take ingenuity and bravery to survive this onslaught. Eckhart learns from Rodriguez that there is a ""command center"" that perhaps operates the unmanned drones and would enable the Air Force to strike from the air, but this will not be an easy task. What this movie does so well is take us into the frontlines as the city is being engulfed in a constant barrage of alien attack, up, close, and personal with the Marines. We learn about the attackers as they do and follow the soldiers as they march through a once densely populated city now in ruins. Some die as on any true battlefield, while all types of heroism are provided by the soldiers in an attempt to get any civilians out of harm's way, engage the enemy, and help defeat the invaders. The camera-work is designed to have us as observers on the enemy lines with the Marines, right there among them, seeing the carnage along with them. I think the movie succeeds. The alien menace always remains just out of focus, but we know they are there and have quite an arsenal. That's where the fun lies, I think, watching the soldiers respond to such uneven odds, and doing so commendably, scoring minor victories until they get that chance to aim at the ""big cahuna"", the command center. Special mention to Ramon Rodriguez as 2nd Lt. William Martinez, the leader of the outfit who Eckhart's Sgt Nantz answers to (and must sometimes coach), given the ""big heroic sequence"" where he gives his life to the others to take out a walking drone blaster.",/review/rw2397164/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2011,zardoz-13,8," Aliens Versus Leathernecks
","If the tenacious enemy the U.S. Marines tangle with in director Jonathan Liebesman's ""Battle: Los Angeles"" didn't come from another planet, then this above-average PG-13 rated Columbia Pictures' release wouldn't qualify as a science fiction shoot'em up. As it is, ""Battle: Los Angeles"" amounts to marginal sci-fi. The guys who wrote and directed this suspenseful but straightforward 116-minute saga strive for adrenaline-laced realism. They aren't out to imitate the outlandish audacity of ""Skyline"" with its ""Cloverfield"" style monsters trashing a coastal metropolis. Ostensibly, ""Battle: Los Angeles"" seems like a Marine recruiting video. The scarcity of memorable characters and scene-stealing aliens are offset by its splendid computer generated special effects and Aaron Eckhart's bravura performance.",/review/rw2397164/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2011,CSHaviland,7," I'll save you the suspense: It's a war movie

","Ever since District 9, a whole new door has been opened to alien and sci-fi films everywhere. It seems like that was the film it took to inspire people to go back into the genre and we were cursed with Battle L.A. I think I nearly had a seizure after leaving the movie theater, my friends and I could barely stand our heads hurt so much. I mean the shaky cam effect, we can handle to an extent, but this was just a horrible story. Believe me when I say that the critics are right on this one. I honestly don't understand how there could be one positive review on this movie because it's ugly, it's stupid and it's such American propaganda. Seriously, every 5 minutes there is some kind of ""Marines Rule!"" speech being thrown at you. I can tell you that they failed because my friends and I agreed that if this were to ever happen in real life, we would just join the army and do the thinking for the marines who shoot first and ask questions later. There were so many flaws with this film that I don't even know where to begin, but I will tell you about the ""story"" first as hard as some moments were to follow as they wouldn't stop moving the camera every 2 seconds.",/review/rw2397164/?ref_=tt_urv

","The time is today (well, a few months away, to be exact) and the macro background is rendered intentionally vague. What the alien invaders really are is absolutely inconsequential. They are enemies and must be defeated – their lives or ours, period. Yes, there is one scene in which US marines and a civilian vet plunge their hands into the open torso of a dying alien (it's hard to tell whether it's front or back), ransacking, pulling out an assortment of slimy objects, trying to find a vital organ. The outcome of this unintentionally (or maybe intentionally, I don't know) comical scene is a simple, sweet conclusion: their heart is on their right side – to kill, shoot right.

11 March 2011,rivertam26,8," wow
","Wow...Now it's been a long time since I said that when it comes to a movie. Or anything really. But I'll say it again. Wow! Battle: Los Angeles looked fantastic from it's electrifying TV spots and Trailers but who knew it would actually live up to the intensity I hoped for. And it does and it's so much than I could have hoped for. The film is simplistic in concept we get invaded this is the story of the marine platoon who discovers a weakness in the deadly E.T. force turning the war back into our favor. There's a little bit of back story thrown in at the beginning so we get a gist of each individual. But when the action starts it doesn't stop and it is intense. Don't think this is Transformers or even Independence Day for that matter this is a new beast borrowing from 80's classics like Aliens and Predator and adding in the realism of Paranormal Activity if you will. The movie is so intense, it's a little corny in parts but emotionally engaging nonetheless, it's terrifying in parts, even a little disturbing but most of all it's just a great time at the movies a big buttery, salty popcorn flick. The film doesn't aim for depth and even though it offers glimpses of a different film it doesn't veer away from it's true intention. Which is to entertain the crap out of you. And it does. I laughed, I cried, I sweated and I cheered, in fact everyone did when the movie ended. Battle Los Angeles is truly an electrifying roller coaster ride of a film. And it owes it all too Johnathan Liebesman director of the somewhat promising but silly Darkness Falls and the grim but rawly dread drenched Texas Chainsaw Massacre: the beginning. he brings those elements here with a little sprinkle of when Michael Bay made good films. Sure the acting isn't spot on all the time and the major problem to be honest is the screenplay with some truly insipid dialog. But the film is beautifully done, with great creative cinematography and sound effects that will blow you away and some surprisingly involving performances especially from Aaron Eckheart and Bridget Moynahan. And being a gay man I must say I came across a new crush Gino Anthony Nesi he's so gorgeous and I hope to see much more of him in movies to come. All in all a super, great entertaining film the best film of it's kind in the last twenty years.",/review/rw2397164/?ref_=tt_urv
