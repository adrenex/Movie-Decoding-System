16 November 2004,claudio_carvalho,8," Although Full of Clichés, An Excellent Action Movie
","The honest and efficient Detective Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) is a married cop with three children, having difficulties for the payment of his mortgage and for having sex with his wife. His partner is the also honest, efficient and wealthy Detective Mike Lowrey (Will Smith), who inherits a large amount from his family and although living like a playboy, has not resigned to his position in the police department. After a daring robbery of heroin from the police department stores, the two detectives try to find some clue about the gang. The chance appears with the hooker Julie Mott (Téa Leoni), the witness of the murder of a 'working girl' friend of her. The detectives are assigned to protect her and chase the killers. Although full of clichés, 'Bad Boys' is an excellent action movie, in the same line of 'Lethal Weapon'. There are lots of funny parts, Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are excellent as the two partners with different behaviors and Téa Leoni is gorgeous. I saw this movie a couple of years ago, when Will Smith was an unknown actor, and now I saw it again on DVD, with the intention of watching 'Bad Boys II'. My vote is eight.",/review/rw1956206/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7," Pretty entertaining buddy comedy
","The 'buddy comedy' genre is fairly well-known, there have been plenty of them, all of them primarily based on the basic idea of having two main characters who are, well, buddies; they act like friends to each other, they get in fights, they help each other out, they compliment each other. It's a fairly easy genre to master, and an easy way to make a good movie. This is one of the best examples, since Smith and Lawrence really do compliment each other so well; Smith's the sleek, cool one who is popular with the ladies, while Lawrence is often nervous, and pretty much a direct opposite of Smith. They have pretty good on-screen chemistry, too; you believe that these are good friends and partners. My only real problem with the film is the way the comedy almost all is generated by stereotypes, and, worse, the age-old complications that arise from certain situations. I think that's a little unoriginal, but, hey, that's the only complaint about it, and the film does have some very entertaining comedy parts. The plot is pretty good, it keeps the film going and supplies every single scene with comedy, action, or both. It takes off immediately, and keeps a good pace throughout the 2 hour duration. The acting is all pretty good. The characters are well-written, well, for stereotypes at least(because, lets face it; they are). The comedy is well-done and often made me laugh out loud, and, believe me, I am not, in any way, shape or form, a Will Smith fan. The action was well-done too, intense and exciting. The film, all in all, was pretty good, very entertaining. For a buddy comedy, it's good. For an action comedy, it's good too. I recommend it to all fans of action comedies, and buddy comedies. 7/10",/review/rw1956206/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 1999,Casa2000,," Michael Bay: The Next Big Thing
","I had no high hopes when I walked into this film.  I like Will Smith, I like Martin Lawrence, so I figured this film will at least be funny.  And it was funny, and then some.  It was action packed, thrilling and a helluva good time.  I came out of the theatre thinking that the guy who directed that movie is going to be huge.",/review/rw1956206/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2002,tfrizzell,," Bad Boys, Good Film.
","Detectives Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have three days to find $100 million worth of heroin from a crazed drug-dealer in Miami in this fast-paced and comedy/action thriller. The witness to a murder (Tea Leoni) of one of Smith's best friends is also along for the frantic ride that is fun, clever and highly entertaining. Watch for then-NBA star John Salley in a great cameo as an imprisoned computer hacker. A rare winner from a sometimes trivial cinematic genre. 4 stars out of 5.",/review/rw1956206/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2016,ivo-cobra8,10," One of my all time favorite best action buddy cop films of my childhood, I love it to death!
","Bad Boys (1995) is the best Michael Bay's buddy action movie, my all time favorite buddy cop film starring Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. This is a film that I really do believe that it is a classic action movie of the 90's. This is my childhood movie my all time classic action buddy cop films honestly? I think it is MILES way better action movie than Lethal Weapon and Beverly Hills Cop, but that is just me and my opinion. I love this film to death it is my all time favorite Michael Bay film along with The Rock (1996), Transformers and Transformers: Dark of the Moon. I saw this movie probably over 10.0000 times more than the sequel, my mom bought me a VHS tape which I still have it. I bought this movie on Blu-Ray years ago and no I don't have (Mastered in 4K) I have a normal Blu-ray disc. The only thing that bothers me is a green cover which does not fit to this film. This is my all time favorite Will Smith movie I grew up watching his TV show The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990 - 1996) and Bad Boys become my favorite Will Smith film along side Bad Boys II and Independence Day, these are my all time favorite Will Smith movies that he did. Someday I am going to re watch Men In Black trilogy.",/review/rw1956206/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2008,hnt_dnl,10," The last great buddy cop action movie!
","I'm pretty sure that BAD BOYS is the only film of Michael Bay's that I like. Well, technically, while it is the only Bay flick that I like, I can also say that I LOVE it, too! I know that it's supposedly a mindless action buddy cop flick, but it is hugely entertaining and extremely well done. THIS is the type of movie where all of the Bay trademarks work: the driving musical score, the quick jump cuts between and within scenes, funny dialogue (which actually is funny in this film!), strong leads, some seriously sexy females, and characters that sweat all the time (and there's a reason for it here: there in Miami!).",/review/rw1956206/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2019,rtifak,9," Not Oscar award material but damn entertaining
","Average rating is 6.9? What do people expect? This is one of the most entertaining cop movies ever along with Training Day and Enof of watch. I'm so disappointed in the people who gave poor ratings. Action and comedy are adeqately packed in a 2 hour film. Although It was made in 1995, it is still stylish. You wouldn't feel it's outdated a bit. And, Porsche 964 turbo gets me so excited every time i watch this.",/review/rw1956206/?ref_=tt_urv

","Just great high octane action entertainment. You could argue it's a shallow exercise, but with outstanding action set pieces and a couple of leads hitting chemistry gold, it's an action junkies dream. 8/10",/review/rw1956206/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2019,UniqueParticle,9," A excellent blockbuster hit comedy/action
","Among one of few great Micheal Bay films! Hilarious fun that remains timeless in entertainment value and joy. Will Smith, Martin Lawerence, and Joe Panatlio are so awesome! Absolutely love the camera shots, despite the hate Micheal gets his style is incredible in all his projects and the beautiful scenery is delightful. Very enjoyable story about a witness that sees stuff and heroine criminals.",/review/rw1956206/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2019,justin-fencsak,8," Nearly 25 years later, still one of Michael Bay's better movies
","As a protege of Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, who died after the movie came out before The Rock was released, Michael Bay made his directorial debut with this modestly budgeted buddy comedy that spawned a sequel and another one coming out next January, all starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. THe title of the movie is based on a popular song used for the classic tv show COPS, and both movies including this one have a killer soundtrack. Will Smith got his big break with this movie before getting into an even bigger movie with ID4 (soon to be dwarfed by others including Alladin). Martin Lawrence, fresh off from his hit tv show Martin on fox, is the buddy of will smith.",/review/rw1956206/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wow, this had a great beginning. The opening credits scene was as good as the best of the James Bond flicks. Those overhead shots of Miami at night were awesome, too. Unfortunately, a few minutes after that great opening, the movie starts to go downhill and then accelerates most of the rest of the way.",/review/rw1956206/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2009,jotix100,5," The Lawrence and Smith show
","The producers of this film appear to be parodying some of their own better made action features involving two cops. In this case, narc cops working in Miami. The director, Michael Bay, indulges his two stars in what becomes a show where the two leads trade barbs and funny lines, perhaps to amuse themselves. This is a total rip off of much better cop films the producers have made.",/review/rw1956206/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2008,Movie_Muse_Reviews,5," An action film that will forever be stuck in the 90s
","""Bad Boys"" is a 1990s cop movie. The music, the slow motion, the excessive amount of explosions and the reference to a retired Michael Jordan in 1995 give that away easily. Good films transcend time and a majority of the people that watch ""Bad Boys"" in the future will not be too impressed with what they see.",/review/rw1956206/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2020,rivertam26,9," Fantastic action setpieces
",This movies action scenes are ridiculous and utterly fantastic. The way in which Michael Bay artfully executes the action sequences are breathtaking and amazingly edge of your seat. The film is a reminder of why Wil Smith became such a superstar and his chemistry with Martin Lawrence is spot on and they are just hilarious. The pair of officers come upon a drug cartel and end up protecting a feisty witness played by a slightly annoying but kinda bad ass Tea Leoni. It's strange as the film almost comes across as a parody because it revels in such cliches and celebrates them. And honestly that's really part of its charm. Still watching this so many years later it's still so overly entertaining and unique.,/review/rw1956206/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2007,dwpollar,2," Worthless Michael Bay-directed garbage...
","1st watched 7/20/2007 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Michael Bay): Worthless Michael Bay-directed garbage. After this one, I think Michael Bay has been cemented in my mind as one of the worst directors of all time. As you can tell, I'm not one of his fans. This time, he has taken a couple of pretty appealing movie stars and turned them into worthless action heros with the occasional one-liner thrown in (Aka -Travolta & Cage w/ Face-Off). This time he's done it with Will Smith & Martin Lawrence. He has the unique ability of spending lots of money blowing things up and devoiding the audience of all caring for it's characters. This movie is about a bickering cop due who become involved in a major drug deal and protecting a witness, played by Tea Leoni. She provides some of the only nice moments in the movie with some witty lines despite her weak character. Smith & Martin bicker throughout the whole movie, their cop boss yell at them a few times, things blow up, there are a few car chases, people get killed and the good guys end up winners in the end. That's about it for this mindless action-comedy movie from one of the biggest money wasting directors of our time, who has very little good stuff to show for it. America, please give up on this genre and this director before we all go bankrupt!!",/review/rw1956206/?ref_=tt_urv

12 August 2002,DHD99,," Finally, a successful marriage of comedy and action/thriller
","This high-action crime drama stands out for me because it succeeds at doing what other movies* have tried and, in my opinion, failed to do -- integrate genuinely funny comedy into the mix. The success is attributable partly to the comedic talents of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence -- who have the ability to deliver crude, rude dialog such that it's funny nevertheless -- and partly to a story that combines suspense and humor into a believable whole.

26 July 1999,baumer,9," one of the best action/comedies around
","There is something about black humour that I love.  And I don't mean humour that is gross or dark, I really mean humour by black actors/artists. Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor were funny in their day.  Whoopie Goldberg has me in stitches when she is on stage or in a movie.  Chris Rock is an up and coming comic genius.  And the two guys in this film have me in laughing almost every time I see them on screen.  Martin Lawrence was the best part of Boomerang and in Bad Boys he is hilarious as the married side kick to Will Smith's bachelor playboy.  And of course Will Smith launched his career with this movie.  He is very funny in The Fresh Prince television show and he shows here that his propensity for comedy is excellent.  Together these two are brilliant, one of the best cop buddies since Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh.",/review/rw1956206/?ref_=tt_urv
