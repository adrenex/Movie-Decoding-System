13 April 2006,roghache,7," Engrossing Revolutionary War tale, though not historical
","Being Canadian, I probably know fewer details of the Revolutionary War than the average U.S. viewer, but note that many seem absolutely outraged at the historical untruths of this movie. When I watched it, I personally found it quite captivating but always have enough sense not to get my history from Hollywood. Since my viewing, I've looked up some info and note various inaccuracies such as misplaced characters, exaggeration of British atrocities, inaccurate torching of a church with townsfolk inside being burned alive, and depiction of American owned slaves being freed to serve in the Continental Army. (Apparently, it was the British who promised to free them if they joined their forces, but later reneged.) My apologies if my facts aren't straight. ",/review/rw0632377/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've always had a weak spot for historically inspired dramas. I like movies like for instance ""Braveheart"", ""Gladiator"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"". I don't like them because they give me some good insight on what that time period was like. Most of them aren't very accurate and if I want to know more about the real history, I'll watch some documentaries or read a couple of books. No, I watch this movies to be entertained and that's also the most important thing I focus on when reviewing this kind of movies: Did I like what I saw or was it boring as hell?

","""The Patriot"", the story of an American farmer who fights in the War of Independence, is sometimes used, together with ""Braveheart"", as evidence of a supposed anti-British prejudice on the part of Mel Gibson. This is perhaps unfair to Gibson, who has gone on record as supporting the ties between Australia and the British monarchy (hardly the stance of a Brit-hating bigot). Although ""Braveheart"", which he produced and directed, was very much Gibson's own pet project, he was neither the producer, director or scriptwriter of ""The Patriot"". Indeed, he was not even first choice to play the lead. The producers originally wanted Harrison Ford who turned the part down, reportedly because he felt that the script turned the American Revolution into the story of one man's quest for revenge.",/review/rw0632377/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2014,ironhorse_iv,7," Don't Thread on the Patriot. It's pretty entertaining despite some faults.
","This movie is a pretty entertaining film, despite the fact that it lacks much historical accuracy and highly controversial for it criticized for demonizing the British Army, and for white-washing slavery out of the time. Still, the movie directed by Roland Emmerich of disaster movie fame, gave us a movie worth watching on Independence Day. I wouldn't be shameful to admit, that I honestly like this movie. The fictional historical war movie take place in American Revolutionary South Carolina, where Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is trying to raise his family in peace. When the movie comes to his doorsteps, and his family threaten, Martin takes on the arms, to help lead the American to freedom. The movie plot is basically the same with Mel Gibson's 1995's epic film, 'Braveheart', nothing really new. Once again, he's out for revenge, this time against Col. William Tavington (Jason Isaac) whom made Martin's life, a living hell. The movie is bloody, gruesome, and violence as hell. I have never saw a movie before this that portray the Napoleonic tactics so brutal. Still, there are some very light moments, some clever comedy, and even a love-story. While, the love-story isn't as strong as Braveheart levels, with Martin love affair with his widow's sister, Charlotte Selton (Joely Richardson) and Martin's son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger) love affair with Anne Howard (Lisa Brenner). It didn't felt, too forced. The film does have a great relationship with the father/son that makes it worth checking out. I have to say, Heath Ledger was pretty much show that he could become a leading man with this film. I do think that Martin does have way too much children in the film that it's hard to keep track of them. I just glad, they didn't notice too much on them and more on him leading a rag-tag team of Militia men. The men were given some backstory, and each one was pretty interesting characters. You got the Reverend (Rene Auberjonois), the wild man (Leon Rippy), the slave (Jay Arlen Jones), the semi-racist Southern (Donald Logue) and the French Man (Tch√©ky Karyo). The movie also had some interesting real life historical figures played by great actors such as Gen. Lord Charles Cornwallis (Tom Wilkenson) and Col. Harry Burwell (Chris Cooper), influence and based off of Henry 'Lighthorse' Lee. Honestly, one of the best scenes in the movie, had to be with Charles Cornwallis and Benjamin Martin doing prison exchange. It was just so fun to watch. Jason Isaac's character is loosely based on Banastre Tartleton who might had cause the Waxhaw Massacre in which prisoners of war were brutally executed. The event helped to create the common image of him as a brutal commander, uninterested in the conventions of civilized warfare, but is a subject of debate, if he indeed fully did those horrible acts, himself. While, Tartleton is indeed a bit crude, he was more human, than Tavington whom is played as sadistic over the top one-dimensional evil villain. Honestly, in real life, the British Army at the time, would probably hang him or discharge him for how often, he disobey orders and how many atrocities was caused by his own hands. Another fault that some critic pick on is how they made Benjamin Martin into the hero, even with him committed atrocities as bad, if not worse, than those perpetrated by the British. Benjamin Martin is a composite figure the scriptwriter claims is based on real American Revolutionary War heroes: Andrew Pickens, Daniel Morgan and Thomas Sumter, but mostly Francis Marion. Francis Marion, the Swamp Fox, was the foremost guerrilla fighter of the Revolution; unfortunately, Marion had no qualms about slavery and he certainly didn't free any of his slaves. Hence, to make Martin more sympathetic to modern audiences, Martin is made anti-slavery sentiments and made Martin not a slave owner. This decision received criticism as a cop-out. What save the Patriot from being one-sided, is that it does not depict the American character Benjamin Martin as innocent of atrocities; a key plot point revolves around the character's haunting guilt over acts he engaged in, such as torturing, killing, and mutilating prisoners during the French and Indian War. Sadly, it get somewhat lost, once the film ends with the sappy happy ending. We never know if he still, being haunted by his actions or any new actions, he commit in this war. Rather than realistic anti-war character, Martin somehow is shoe horse as patriotism hero, even if that not the reason why he went to war in the first place. It makes no sense. Most of the war atrocities in the film, have no factual basis and parallel to the American or European 18th century wars, anyways. Yes, the movie is historical inaccurate, but the film does look like it takes place in 18th century, America. The location sets, the costumes, and the visual/special effects were all amazing. The score by John William is beautiful to listen to. Overall: Like Uncle Sam says, I want you to watch it. It's a good watch.",/review/rw0632377/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2008,cleverfox,9," Liked it - see below
","Just watched this movie for about the 20th time (I have it on TiVo) and for the life of me I cannot find the disdain many who have written here have commented on. Last I heard, this was FICTION - NOT a documentary; Ken Burns did not produce not write nor direct nor narrate this piece - Roland Emmerich, a man known for action FICTION did. Yes the depiction of the Revolutionary War was NOT 100% accurate but was never intended to be; just a drama set against the background of a war and it was refreshing to see the war in the background, whereupon American blood is spilled on American soil, was the Revolutionary War and not another Civil War piece; indeed, the Civil War has been played so many times in films over the past quarter century it was just refreshing to see a different war....",/review/rw0632377/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2016,Leofwine_draca,7," Yeah, I thought it was good - AND I'm a Brit
","Mel Gibson's second stab at fighting the British follows on the success of BRAVEHEART for a historical epic that feels both similar and different to the Scots blockbuster. Once again, Gibson plays a family man who has no interest in war and fighting who faces personal loss and turns into a vengeance-fuelled fighter determined to make the enemy pay for their actions. THE PATRIOT doesn't have the scope, drive or excellent scenery of BRAVEHEART, but it is still a very well made movie. Despite the three hour running time the story is never less than engaging and the focus on an individual family (with the War of Independence as the background) makes it more than watchable.",/review/rw0632377/?ref_=tt_urv

4 September 2001,karier13,10," Thoroughly entertaining
",I have been a Mel Gibson fan since his very good Mad Max and his horrible Summer City. I loved this movie and it is in my top ten favorites of all time. Mel is very believable as Benjamin Martin who fights only after he looses one son to death and one son to the army. Heath Ledger plays Gabriel Martin who goes to fight for his country despite his father's protests. I know that not all of the facts are historically correct but this is a movie and did not claim to be a history lesson. The period is portrayed very well and the battle scenes are so well done that you almost feel you are there. This movie is very graphic in the battles and if you do not like the sight of blood and other realistic battle scenes then this might not be the movie for you. I watched the entire movie and did not realize the length. I was so engrossed in the plots.,/review/rw0632377/?ref_=tt_urv

","Samuel Johnson was right when he identified patriotism as the last refuge of a scoundrel, and the proof is in this cartoon call to arms from the makers of 'Independence Day' and the Hollywood remake of 'Godzilla'. The film is a bubblegum whitewash of early American history, with all the misguided crowd-pleasing appeal of an Armed Forces recruitment ad, casting Mel Gibson as a conscientious objector (in screen vernacular always the next worse thing to an outright sissy) who rediscovers the moral rewards of deep commitment during the Revolutionary War, mostly by slaughtering half the Redcoats in New England. Screenwriter Robert Rodat waves the flag more stridently here than in his previous 'Saving Private Ryan', helping Gibson to shed his pacifism by presenting him with an adversary (British colonel Jason Isaacs) so evil and sadistic that even his own troops despise him (and later impaling the villain directly onto the Stars and Stripes, in a particularly grisly bit of low-brow propaganda).",/review/rw0632377/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Patriot is NOT a documentary. It didn't pretend to be, and wasn't. Loosely based upon Francis Marion (the ""Swamp Fox""), it only touched on Marion's impact on the Revolution in South Carolina. If anything, it was downplayed. For instance, in real life, he had over 150 men in his guerrilla band. The movie portrayed him as having far fewer. As a documentary, it fails on this and many other points.

26 May 2010,mnpollio,2," Absolute rubbish
","Utter bilge disguised as history lesson which plays as such a typical example of a latter-day auto-pilot Mel Gibson career effort that one could go down a checklist. Over the top violence? Check. Gibson cast as a one-dimensional character who endures a ridiculous amount of physical turmoil? Check. Cartoony villains? Check. Death(s) of major supporting character(s) to give Gibson's lead a motivated vendetta? Check. The depiction of the British army is so laughable that it seems impossible they could have ever amassed an empire at all much less won any hard fought battles. Gibson is typically and unmemorably cast as a French-Indian War veteran and widowed father of a gigantic brood (no doubt Mrs. Martin expired from prolonged stays in the delivery room). He hopes to avoid any conflict in the forthcoming Revolutionary War, but when his family is targeted and threatened by Snidely Whiplash (oops, I mean Jason Isaacs channeling Snidely Whiplash), naturally a macho man has to do what a man has to do. The late Heath Ledger is on hand as Gibson's eldest son Gabriel. He looks pretty in Revolutionary War outfits, but there is little more to the role than that. Trivia claims that screenwriter Robert Rodat penned 17 drafts before settling on the current version. He should have penned at least another 17 more because the final version is trash. The film has all of the depth of a puddle. The British are all evil and stupid, Gibson is some unholy combo of Rambo and George Washington, and to say that the film takes liberty with facts is an understatement of massive proportions. One scene involves the British army locking unarmed women, children and old people in a church (including a major supporting character) and setting it ablaze murdering all inside. Try as I might, I have researched this and cannot locate so much as one recorded incident of such a thing being perpetrated by the British army in the Revolutionary War. The film's most laughable moment features Joely Richardson, as Gibson's sister-in-law and token love interest, being placed in charge of caring for his underage brood. When the British arrive at her home to take them prisoner, she literally sneaks them out under an entire platoon's nose by hiding under tables and behind bushes, etc. My description fails to do the lunacy justice - I thought perhaps I had wandered in to a children's fantasy-adventure for a moment. Total garbage - I suggest fans of this film pick up a book and read about the Revolutionary War - it would really be eye-opening for them.",/review/rw0632377/?ref_=tt_urv
