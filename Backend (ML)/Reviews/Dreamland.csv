30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Surprised by how much I liked this!
",I was absolutely blown away by how good The Queen's Gambit was! The only reason I actually started watching it was because of all the great ratings/reviews and I'm glad I did because it was such an entertaining series. It's set during the Cold War era and follows orphaned chess prodigy Beth Harmon (Anya Taylor-Joy) as she struggles with addiction in her quest to become the greatest chess player in the entire world. Taylor-Joy has been a rising star for the last few years but she breaks out here as she was just absolutely terrific as the lead. She's now one of the hottest young actresses in Hollywood. This ended up winning an Emmy for most Outstanding Limited Series.,/review/rw7165250/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2020,ccrisss,10," Beautiful. Just Beautiful.
","Watched it all in one night.
I didn't think a story about chess would keep me interested. But this one got me deeply invested.
Because this is not just about the game of chess, it's so much more.",/review/rw7165250/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is not the typical type of show that I would usually watch but I'm so glad I did. It's so unique and different that it's difficult to put into words. If you're thinking of watching this show, just do it, you won't be disappointed.",/review/rw7165250/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2020,anacasaux,9," Don't start this series late at night!
","You'll end up like me, binge watching it until 5 AM (and I don't even know anything about chess). Very well written, directed and acted.",/review/rw7165250/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2020,phdcore,9," Mr Shaibel the main role
","He did deserve more. But having never received it, made for a very emotional, powerful scene when Beth returned. That scene and that emotion would not have been possible if Mr. Shaibel had gotten what he deserved throughout the series. There were a few simple but powerful scenes with Mr. Shaibel that hit me really hard. When young Beth begged him to help her after she was punished and he couldn't even respond to her because he was so ashamed he didn't have the power to help her. When she drove away in the car after being adopted and he couldn't even wave goodbye to her... you could literally feel his grief without him even saying a word. When she walked down to the basement to see his old room and looked down at the table where he first taught her to play, that was hard enough. But when she looked over at the clippings he kept on his wall of her... that was just too much. Hard to keep your eyes dry watching that scene. This story was written with the purpose of having the reader or watcher, identify with Beth. But I think for a lot of us, we identified with Mr. Shaibel.",/review/rw7165250/?ref_=tt_urv

","When you've seen everything on Netflix, a you will watch any new show they throw at you. I did not have high expectations. But I was so wrong. So wonderfully and totally wrong.
We watched Queen's Gambit, all seven hours of it, in a single sitting. This show is an absolute gem. Remarkable acting by Anya Taylor-Joy who will be a force to be reckoned with, her child counterpart- an absolute marvel. The series is smart, it's inspiring at times, it's sad and heartbreaking at times. Who knew watching game-plays of simulated chess can make your heart pound out of your ears? Truly, a story of determination, friendship, self discovery, struggle and triumph. I don't know about you, but my ceiling will be covered in chess pieces tonight.",/review/rw7165250/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2020,bilgedeger,10," Best Netflix Original of 2020
","The Queen's Gambit was a random find for me. I started watching it without any expectations but the first episode was just enough to keep me interested. As I kept watching, it kept getting better and I must say the 7th episode was one of the best finale to a series that I have ever watched. The character developments for even the minor characters were well-thought-out and I immediately formed an emotional connection with most of them. The finale was so well done that it almost felt like an end to a show with several seasons rather than a limited series. The show also had very good messages sprinkled in between, they were subtle and didn't make me feel like an agenda was being showed down my throat. The acting was marvelous. The cinematography was great with some very impressive scene transitions. The score was amazing and really set the atmosphere and the tone of the show. If you are reading this before watching the show, go ahead and watch it. You won't be disappointed.",/review/rw7165250/?ref_=tt_urv

23 October 2020,Georgefestws,10," Guarnteed to be an award winning show!
","This TV Mini-series is excellent! It is wonderful to see Anya Taylor-Joy in a well crafted show. She shines brilliantly as Beth Harmon a chess playing prodigy. The story takes us from when she is a small girl, orphaned, continuing through her teenage angst years. I highly recommend this show. Great cinematography and directing and of course to get back to the acting - its top notch! I only wish there was more than 7 episodes.",/review/rw7165250/?ref_=tt_urv

",Really enjoyed this series. One reviewer gave a low rating mentioning how the first episode showed her using pills in the orphanage....yes they had to as it shapes the rest of her future. The characters are great and the acting on is superb. Kept me hooked!,/review/rw7165250/?ref_=tt_urv

","While I am an avid chess player, you do not need to love chess in order to love this series. This is the first time I have ever given a rating a perfect 10. The cast is beyond amazing, Anya Taylor-Joy did an outstanding job. The story and writing was brilliant. The cinematography was perfection and captured every little detail for the time period. The music was perfect!",/review/rw7165250/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2020,Xavier_Stone,9," As a chess player this movie is good even if you've never played the game
","I've seen quite a bit of chess movies and this one is by far the best. It combines the quirks of being a savant at a game and the underlying issues that come along with it. Generally the game of championship chess is extremely boring as it usually takes 2 hours a game, regularly 10-20mins/move. This movie speeds all that up yet keeps things grounded and interesting.",/review/rw7165250/?ref_=tt_urv

25 October 2020,valentinmh,9," Excellent !
","Agree with most of the high-rating reviews here. This is how a movie/series should be done, congratulations to all crew ! Glad there are still intellingent and talented people to do this, which - sadly - is less and less often in our time.",/review/rw7165250/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2020,DrProfessor,7," Enjoyable watch.
","I liked this. I enjoyed the acting and characters. I wasn't sure about casting Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Benny, but he eventually grew on me. I couldn't really give it a higher rating because it was just too predictable.",/review/rw7165250/?ref_=tt_urv

","As a story of female empowerment, the series is good. As a story of obsession with an activity, it is also interesting. It is even good as a way to make chess look cool.",/review/rw7165250/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2020,vabal,9," One of a kind!
","It's not only a good series, it's not only the wonderful story, acting, cinematography, music. You watch it and it feels like the movie itself is a chessgame. With a rather weak opening indeed, a fabulous middlegame and a perfect ending. It's the kind of movies/series that stucks you in your armchair, on your couch or even in your bed anyway, forgetting about eating, sleeping, living. After the end, the return to reality has not yet occurred. You are still tormented in dimly lit orphanages, you travel all over the world, you are welcomed in super-bright chess tournaments a little more arrogant and well-dressed and you analyze variants. Do not miss it!",/review/rw7165250/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2022,Katz5,8," Makes Chess Exciting
","Chess has been the focus, or sub-focus, of several other movies, from Searching for Bobby Fischer to Fresh to Pawn Sacrifice. These are movies that lack the stand-up thrills of sports dramas like Rocky or Hoosiers, but what can you say? It's chess. A more cerebral game means more introverted, quirky characters. And The Queen's Gambit delivers in spades...or should I say, rooks. With 2.6K reviews on IMDb (as of the date of my review), enough has been said about the acting (wonderful, particularly Anya Taylor-Joy, whose eyes express just as much about her character as her words do), the story, and the backdrop.",/review/rw7165250/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2020,tanujisha,7," Mixed feelings
","I did like the story, I did like the settings, I did like the acting and the chess theme. But as the story progressed I started to feel slightly annoyed by the main character, additionally the story got boring as it was always the same, nothing really compelling happened. I did watch till the end, but I didn't find this series overly exceptional as other reviewers did. However, I really liked the depiction of that era and how difficult it was for women at that time.",/review/rw7165250/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2020,rodrveronica,10," Talented Anya Taylor-Joy leads a great cast in a fantastic show.
","The ""Queen's Gambit"" series is based on the 1983 novel by Walter Tevis.
This show doesn't disappoint from the book, in fact it is enthralling! Well directed and shot the story follows an orphan who develops an affinity for chess and prescription pills. Developed by Scott Frank and Allan Scott the show premiered October 23, 2020 on Netflix. Headlining a talented cast, Anya Taylor-Joy is incredible. Her performance exceeds expectations and her heartfelt moments are riveting.",/review/rw7165250/?ref_=tt_urv
