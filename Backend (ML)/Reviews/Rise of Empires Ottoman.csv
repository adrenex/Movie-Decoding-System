30 December 2022,jesuison,8," This has no business being this good
","I was pleasantly surprised that a second season came out, and about Mehmed II and the notorious Vlad no less. I really liked the first season because it's like a storytelling by historians with the flare of well done reenactment. Obviously, there are liberties taken for the drama, but it's cool to have a mix of history with what could be another Vikings type show. Although some of the the acting isn't Oscar worthy, the actor playing Mehmed has a memorable face and owns the role.",/review/rw5437631/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2020,a_dratzidis,8," Historically accurate with an Italian fetish
","As a a Greek, I could have been pre-emptively negative about this series.
However, I cannot ignore the fact that the producers did some serious research and consultation before they put pen to paper.
From the small conversations to the serious arguments, it appears that they have checked first with the historians.",/review/rw5437631/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2020,Amazing-Stories,8," Powerful and bingeworthy
","This is a historical fiction docuseries, showing the Fall of Constantinople from a Turkish perspective. Historical fiction is by definition not fully historically accurate, because past events are placed on a narrative arc and dramatized in order to build a strong story. Accept this and you'll be a happier viewer.",/review/rw5437631/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,ayhdal,8," Daniel Natu ( Vlad Dracula)
","Yes historically not accurate, lots of BS etc.. But it was entertaining. I actually watched the whole series in a day. Mehmed vs Vlad is better than the previous one. I like the actor who played Mehmed ( Cem Yigit Uzumoglu) I think he was great. Story telling was also great ( I think he is the guy who played the lanister in GOT) . But what people should notice is the actor who played Vlad Dracula. He wasn't acting, it looked real. We don't see this level of acting very often. Absolutelly amazing. I think he is World Class and he should be in Hollywood. What a great actor. Well Done Daniel. I wish you all the best. And would like to see more from you. 10/10.",/review/rw5437631/?ref_=tt_urv

24 January 2020,yusufpiskin,10," Rise of the Cem Yigit Uzumoglu
","Few people can call themselves true world conquerors but when it comes to Mehmed II, there's a reason this man was known as Mehmed The Conqueror. Following the conquest of the iconic city of Constantinople, Rise Of Empires combines narration and expert analysis with dramatic reenactments that'll be instantly recognisable to anyone who watched last year's The Last Czars. With a lot more focus on warfare and strategic battle planning, Ottoman is a fascinating and educational series, one that takes a wise approach to showcase more action alongside the narration.",/review/rw5437631/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2020,emrebuyukgungor,6," Good series but wrong title
","Title should be Rise of Legends: Giustiniani. Whole series are about Giustiniani, he was shown more than Sultan Mehmet and Emperor Constantine. They show him/his name at least once every 5 minutes. It is being demonstrated as the war is between 80.000 ottoman army and Giustiniani.",/review/rw5437631/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2020,Erlik_Han,1," Accurate retelling by experts, muddied by horribly inaccurate dramatization and narration
","First off every single Turk in the show, except the slave girl that converted to Christianity, have the stereotypical ""evil guy"" look. They always have an evil grin and they always dress in black. Every single scene they are threatening someone etc. Meanwhile the eastern Roman / Byzantines wear colorful clothes, have soft nice expressions (except Giovanni Giustiniani who is portrayed as a ""lovable womanizing pirate / mercenary"")",/review/rw5437631/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2020,kostas-02274,9," Very entertaining and educational
","I found this mix of drama and documentary highly entertaining, visually impressive, and educational. I've read a few books about the siege of Constantinople, and always thought ""what a great story, why doesn't anyone make a movie out of it?"". When I found out that this was a Turkish production, I was afraid it'd be based as they are too close to the subject to be objective, but the basics of the story are accurately displayed. Yes, they puffed up Giustiniani and added a couple of female characters while other protagonists are missing. They simplified a lot of stuff and didn't go in depth into what preceded the siege and the motivations of the characters. But most of what made the cut is historically accurate, always allowing for the conflicting accounts and various viewpoints. Choices were obviously made on basis of which made better dramaturgical sense and which were more realistic, not in order to glorify this or that side. Some Turkish reviewers insist that ""this isn't how it happened"" (meaning ""not what was I taught at school"") and even believe that sultan Mehmet actually designed his cannons himself. Now maybe that's reported by one of his biographers but how possible is it that a 20-year old prince with no knowledge of metallurgy designed the most advanced weapons of his time? Anyway, I found that the producers used the source material well and come out with a gripping docu-drama that generally respected historical truth. If you want more nuances, read some books! I'm already looking forward to the next series.",/review/rw5437631/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2020,Caglatureray,7," UNTRUTHFUL SUBJECTIVE documentary, with great visual effects.
","I gave it a 7rating due to high quality of visual effects. Moreover the actor playing the main character, Mehmed II, seems to be a great actor. Overall Production quality is good. On the other hand, the historical explanations, details are not really truthful. They made heroes out of Genoese and Venetians. ??!!! What about the story behind the conquest by Ottoman emperor? What was the emotional reason behind it ? Why are there no details about the christians' crusade wars? Where is the talk about revenge? Where is the talk about the importance of Istanbul ?
Plus, Mehmed's mother is known, she is Hüma Hatun, she even has a grave! But this productions says: ""mehmet's mother is unknown"". That is very confusing! This whole production is mainly lacking the truth. I didn't find it objective at all. The history has been demonstrated as if it was a Spartans movie. What about the customs and traditions of Turkish people? This documentary is Really really brain washing !! Who the f. is Giustiani?? Why is he at the center of this documentary? For example why didn't we see more of Zaganos Pasha? Isn't he more important as the right hand of the conqueror?? Doesn't he deserve more scenes than Ana character? Why is the emotional struggle of Ottoman army NOT shown, why does this production heavily weigh in towards the emotional struggle of Byzantine fighters? This production is very biased. This is a documentary but unfortunately NOT OBJECTIVE and NOT TRUTHFUL. Where are the great Turkish historians who can tell us the story better? For example Professor Ilber Ortayli. He should have been involved in this production.",/review/rw5437631/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2022,paulabuzgau,7," Vlad vs Mehmed
","Too bad Netflix didn't do season 2 about Huniadi. It makes no sense why Vlad hates Mehmed so much. His hostage time with the ottomans couldn't have had such an impact on his personality. People weren't that complicated then... If the viewers had seen Ioan Huniade's war with the empire and how Vlad's family was involved, things would have had more clarity and truthfulness. Plus viewers would have had the chance of finding out how Vlad's family came to be known by that name...
On the other hand it's good that western civilisation has a chance to know more about this famous or rather infamous ruler which inspired Stocker.",/review/rw5437631/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2022,jamesrupert2014,8," An interesting and reasonably well-made 'docudrama' about the fall of Constantinople in 1453
","In 1453, youthful Sultan Mehmed II, new to the throne of the Ottoman Empire, attacks the great fortress city of Constantinople, the last bastion of the Roman Empire. Produced in Turkey, the six-part series blends recreations of historical events with commentaries by historians and academics, and seems to be reasonably consistent with what is believed to have occurred (although the odd scene of what many at the time thought to be the Virgin Mary leaving the Hagia Sophia Cathedral is left unexplained and the alleged brutality of the Ottoman troops in the first days of the conquest are largely unmentioned (not surprisingly, descriptions of the actions of the conquering solders vary substantially between Christian and Muslim sources)). The recreations are quite good (although the mise a scene, especially the costumes, look a lot like 'medieval fashion' as popularised in 'Game of Thrones'). The small scale battle scenes are well-done but there are few 'large scale' scenes, such as showing armies battling on the ruins of the city's vast walls (likely due the expense involved in recreating such events realistically). The acting is quite good, notably Cem Yigit Üzümoglu as the young sultan-warrior and Birkan Sokullu as Giovanni Giustiniani, leader of the Genoese mercenaries fighting for Constantinople's Emperor, Constantine XI Palaiologos (Tommaso Basili). There are some unnecessary side-stories and Mehmed's history is presented in a series of sometimes disjointed flashbacks but all-in-all an entertaining, interesting, and apparently reasonably accurate presentation about a major historical event (and one about which I knew nothing). Worth watching.",/review/rw5437631/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2022,tomescu_katalin,7," A lie there another one here but
","I am 100% sure that not even 50% of what they told is real. There are so many things said wrong. I don't understand why the Ottomans are seen as heroes for so long, but considering that the director is a Turk, it makes sense. But I'm not going to sit here and do a bad review because I really liked both actors. Especially Daniel, he is made for this role, you could see the sparkle in his eyes, something special indeed. I hope we will have more series like this but with a bigger budget. And one more thing, use the native language of the respective countries as much as possible, we have subtitles, that's not the problem.",/review/rw5437631/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2023,evi-75011,7," 1st season good enough but 2nd has more inaccuracies
","Text: I removed my first comment because I hadn't watched season 2 when I wrote it. I am coming back since I have just finished it. First of all the 2 seasons differ concerning inaccuracies. The 1st one relies more on history apart from the fact that they avoid to mention that Constantinos Paleologos was Greek,as many of the greatest emperors in eastern Roman Empire,and they paid too much attention to Justiniani. Ok the latter might have been a very good fighter but he left the battlefield while Paleologos fought till death as a man of honor and a real hero. So HE was the legend and the soul not Justiniani. However many other facts are decent and correct. Mehmed was really smart educated and wanted to be a Ceasar not just a sultan. His mother Huma Hatun was not Turkish that is why they didn't mention her origin,she was probably from Greece or Serbia. Historians say that is why Mehmed was different from other sultans and much more educated Or maybe helped him his adoptive mother Mara who was from a noble family half Serbian(from her father)half Greek(from her mother). Mara was really qualified and built many churches too so the environment Mehmed grew up was civilized concerning religions and different cultures.",/review/rw5437631/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2020,mumarnaeem,1," Flawed, historically inaccurate, fictional
","I'm surprised that Netflix even let it go online.
The show is supposed to be a historical drama, but it is full of lies from the very start. One could probably accept this show as a made up historical show with small glimpses of historical facts and the rest as biased inaccuracies to glorify the Constantinople emperor, but when the title is ""Rise of Empires: Ottoman"", how could you possibly lie about Sultan Mehmet and his epic siege of Constantinople that gave birth to one of the strongest empires in history i.e. Ottoman.
Sultan Mehmet is depicted as getting exiled, being tyrant, having different motives behind the siege than the reality, wrong influencers, etc. The lies go on and on.
Honestly, not worth wasting time, if you are a history lover and want to get your facts right. If you just want to enjoy a historical drama with lies and no truth then go ahead, watch it.",/review/rw5437631/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2020,sariadil,9," I like it but too much Giustiniani
","It seems the war was between Giustiniani and Sultan Mehmet.

","As a Turk, I have studied the history of Ottoman Empire since I was a child.
