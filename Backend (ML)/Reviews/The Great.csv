","At the time this came out, it was without a doubt the best movie to come out of the MCU. I look forward to seeing more from the Russo bros.",/review/rw2986715/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2015,ivo-cobra8,10," The best Marvel comic book superhero movie of 2014 so far!
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) is the best Marvel comic book Action Superhero movie and one of my favorite films of The Avengers! Big, busy and action-packed - like the first movie, but with better pacing. It is a huge improvement over Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) I am sorry but I don't think Joe Johnston is making a good films. He even screwed up my favorite film Jurassic Park III. Great movie! I didn't like the first Captain America but I LOVE this one. Great acting, great story, great action, great EVERYTHING. Marvel Studios continues to improve upon and expand this superhero universe and it shows with Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The action is turned up, the performances are top notch, plus with the addition of Robert Redford raises the bar yet again. Chris Evans certainly owns this role know just as Downey owns Tony Stark.

22 August 2021,SPZMaxinema,9," THIS is Captain America
","A political and action thriller that has an awesome espionage spin to it. Chris Evans and his team kick butt, and Scarlett Johansson is as hot as ever. Plus, mysterious and sinister villains that pose an intimidating threat! Not to mention, the score hits it out of the park with the feels!",/review/rw2986715/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2014,TheLittleSongbird,9," Excellent sequel that outdoes the first film
","That is not to knock the first Captain America film because I enjoyed that too, just that Captain America: The Winter Soldier personally came off as superior. Some of the second half does try to cram in too much giving off an at times bloated and convoluted quality, other than that Captain America: The Winter Soldier was excellent. It is a great-looking film with stylish cinematography and editing that give off a gritty and audacious look, and the special effects and the stunts are of the quality that you can't take your eyes off them. The music is not quite as good as it was in the first but it has enough of the rousing excitement and haunting intensity to make it a good score that matches what is going on on screen. The action sequences are spectacularly choreographed and of edge-of-your-seat calibre whether it is a highway car chase or a sky battle with some of the destruction authentically harrowing, and the screenplay is one that is smart and snappy with heart aplenty. The story is mostly compelling and very cleverly constructed, it mixes action, comic-book adventure and political thriller and does it in a way that is well-balanced, that is alive with nimble nuances and in a way that the film gives off a sense that it knows what it's trying to be. It's suspenseful and exciting with its fair share of themes that gives the film emotion and depth. The characters are engaging and interesting, with their personalities deeper and more expansive, and there is a much more believable villain this time around(the big reveal was actually quite surprising). A great thing considering that the cast of cast is quite large if not quite to the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink extent; the interplay between the characters works a treat also. Anthony and Joe Russo direct astutely and the acting is fine, with Chris Evans even more confident than he was in the first, Scarlett Johansson at her fearless and Anthony Mackie fitting comfortably in his role. Samuel L. Jackson is as dependable as ever, Robert Redford in a bold move gives seasoned support and is not stiff at all and Sebastian Stan is similarly authoritative. All in all, while there are a couple of issues with the second half Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an excellent sequel and manages to outdo the enjoyable first film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2986715/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2020,SebMoz,9," Definietly one of the best MCU movies
","Oh man, was it good to get back to a great movie again after Thor: The Dark World. This movie, unlike that one, is well constructed, written, acted and directed. There is so much to love about the movie it's hard to name it all. The plot is well thought out and realized, complete with great twists and turns to keep you on your toes. I love the spy thriller astethic the movie presents, and it complements the more straight forward action very well. It also presents its themes of trust and morality in a solid and thoughtful way. The pacing is solid, the plot advances in a very natural way, and the movie sets up its important plot points ahead of time to make the movie more enjoyable on rewatches. The movie also does a great job with its characters. Steve, Natasha and Nick are all great characters with their own struggles, while also being very likeable, and they also have excellent chemistry. I love that Steve and Nat's relationsship isn't romantic, as that wouldn't work at all with these characters. I also really like Sam, he's sympathetic and a nice addition. The Winter Soldier is a great villain as well, which mostly comes from the fact that he is just a human, not some evil monster like so many other Marvel villains. I love watching his struggles with indentifying his past and resisting the changes made to his brain, as well as his relationsship with the hero. All this is of course helped by some solid performances from almost everyone involved. The direction is solid as well, with the perfect mix of wide shots and close-ups. The fight choreography is great, one can really feel the weight each fight carries. My only slight issue with the film is the fact that the heroes seem to be saved by plotholes a little too often, for example by a bad guy waiting to killing a good guy just long enough for something to appear to save them. It feels a little stupid, but it's not a big deal and it's pretty easy to ignore if you feel like it. Overall, this movie is extremely good. It does almost everything right, its flaws are small and inconsequental, and it's just a really entertaining movie. I recommend it to anyone who likes superhero movies, or just action movies in general.",/review/rw2986715/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2020,haydenluz,8," Captain America: The Winter Solider
","Captain America: The Winter Solider, directed by the best two directors that MCU has on the team, in the Russo Brothers, crafted this well directed, brisk paced spy/action film, that has a lot to be praised for. The Russo Brothers took the MCU style, and completely flipped it into their own, which completely works, while becoming a model film for the MCU. They incorporated this darker and gritter tone, that essentially grounded the film well, while inevitably throwing in some well timed humor. Even though this new approach to the MCU was a breath of fresh air, the Russo Brothers set themselves up for some nitpicks, by transforming some things that were already set and stone, for the most part.",/review/rw2986715/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2020,sammielimehouse,9," Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) Review - 8.7/10
","Definitely one of the best sequels in the entire MCU. It's everything you would expect and everything you could every ask for in a Captain America sequel. There's nazis, HYDRA, Nick Fury faking his freaking death, and action. Lots of fantastic Marvel action. This isn't just one of those films that are just 95% action, 5% storytelling, one of the things this films does best is balancing story with action. For example, the Winter Soldier and Steve have some of the best fights in the MCU, but whenever Steve finds out who the Winter Soldier is, it becomes not only an amazingly choreographed fight, but also an emotional one. In conclusion, this is the first truly great MCU sequel.",/review/rw2986715/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2020,mahmus,9," The Russos raise the bar
","With The Winter Soldier, the Russo brothers upped the action, the violence, the emotion and the cuts per action scene in a way that would make them the leading force of MCU goodness.",/review/rw2986715/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2022,mrashtastic89,9," Cold as ice
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a fantastic sequel, one of the best sequels of all time and hands down the best Marvel sequel, it takes the MCU to a dark place that it's never gone before and is one of the most grounded and mature MCU films.",/review/rw2986715/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2021,atlasmb,9," One Of The Better MCU Entries
","It is not easy to make sequels---or new episodes that build on past exposition---and live up to the original. But this is one film that manages to remain fresh, thanks to an imaginative script.",/review/rw2986715/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2020,arnohardwell-41638,10," Maybe the best MCU movie
","The fact that I rate this movie with 10 is not an exaggeration. This particular movie I really consider to be the best of MCU as the character development, the story, the action scenes, the direction and many more details still shock you.It could be said that this is a political drama with a strong Marvel dose in it. The dialogues are also excellent and careful written as well as the casting.
I understand that many other movies like Infinity War, Avengers etc. are considered by most to be 'better', but if you watch this specific movie twice or more, you will realize that you are facing a masterpiece in all respects. In most parts of it, you think that you are in the movie and you feel that you are experiencing the emotions of the characters. In my humble personal opinion, I will repeat that Captain America: Winter Soldier is a masterpiece and will always be my number one Marvel movie.",/review/rw2986715/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2014,zardoz-13,10," The Sequel Surpasses the Original!!!
","""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" gives super-hero sequels a good name. Not only is this $170 million blockbuster far better than its superb 'origins' predecessor, but it also is a real game-changer for the Marvel Universe. Former ""Fantastic Four"" actor Chris Evans reprises the title role as Steve Rogers, a 90-pound weakling turned 240-pound heavyweight, whose exploits inspired millions in World War II. Remember Rogers spent about 70 years in suspended animation in an iceberg after he contributed to the defeat the Nazis as well as Hydra. Rogers maintains his sense of honor, or naivety, throughout all his trials and tribulations. Evans makes his old-fashioned, nice-guy antics appear both convincing and charming. Meaning, Captain America remains essentially a goody-two-shoes-bachelor-with-a-shield. Our hero takes a licking but keeps on ticking despite whatever adversaries he tangles with in the second, in-name-only theatrical ""Captain America"" feature.",/review/rw2986715/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2022,D4V1D2411,8," A great spy movie
","It really feels like a spy movie, and one of the good ones. The moral question that this movie presents is really interesting and having Captain America defending whats right gives you chills. The main villain is kinda forgetable in the way that you probaly wont remember his name after watching the movie but Hydra and the winter soldier are super menacing and are great for this movie.",/review/rw2986715/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2022,jaysanchu07,8," The WS is one Badass Villain!
","What a ride! The Winter Soldier sits at the pinnacle of the MCU's best and most entertaining, 10 times better than its predecessor. Can't say enough about the choreography! The street fight against the WS is one of the best I've seen in both weapons and hand to hand combat. The scene alone is a sure fire million views in YouTube. Further complemented by a strong storyline (with some bonus emotional notes to it) and the best villain in the MCU thus far in the WS, and you've got one of the best action films of the decade.",/review/rw2986715/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2021,benjaminwest-242,9," A truly spectacular sequel
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is everything the audience wants it to be and more. Marvel Studios again delivers with well shot fight scenes and exquisite special effects. The plot development is great start to finish, consistently providing intrigue for various plot points. Character development and diving into the emotional caches of each character work well, and come to be a highlight of the film. The whole cast gives convincing, meaningful portrayals of their characters.",/review/rw2986715/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2019,Macleanie,9," Winter Soldier is the best movie in the Avengers series to date
","Winter Soldier is the best movie in the Avengers series to date. Breathtaking visuals mixed with a solid storyline, energetic action sequences and they finally make a true superhero out of Captain America. On a whole it follows on nicely from both The First Avenger and Assemble. It also benefitted from the attendance of Black Widow, and also an excellent villain. The action was superb from start to finish, Captain America himself has a venerability about him with a human nature. Its just thrilling, edge of the seat stuff which puts a real punch back into the Marvels best running series to date.",/review/rw2986715/?ref_=tt_urv

27 June 2020,yaols,8," Captain America: The Winter Soldier
","It's so much better than the first one. In the first half, hand-held photography and aerial photography, close combat became the main component of action drama. In addition, all kinds of spy assassination dramas were almost spy movies. For a time, it was not even a superhero movie, but a spy movie with upgraded equipment. In the second half, the visual effect of a large movie was produced to climax before the original was restored.",/review/rw2986715/?ref_=tt_urv

27 March 2014,YJLcool,8," What should have been a typical superhero film, now becomes a conspiracy-espionage thriller.
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the third film in Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (after last year's Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World). Compared with the mighty giant green monster, the hammer wielding Norse thunder god or the 'genius, philanthropist, billionaire, playboy' armor man, the Captain was never quite as appealing as the rest of the 'Unusuals'. Steve Rogers is portrayed as an old-fashioned, straightforward, honest, courageous, sincere, patriotic superhero. This makes him a less-interesting, boring character. Moreover, as Tony Stark said it, ""Everything special about you came out of a bottle!""",/review/rw2986715/?ref_=tt_urv
