22 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,9," Terrific!
","I have to say that I really enjoyed 1883 even more than I thought I wound. This is the prequel to Yellowstone as it shows the Dutton family as they travel from Texas to Montana looking for a better life. It's created by Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone, Mayor of Kingstown, etc.). Sheridan has turned in one great show after another and this one is no different. It's a very gritty and violent show that showed off the realness of the Wild West. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special. It's too bad that this is only a mini-series and there aren't more seasons coming because I would love to see more from this show.",/review/rw8800698/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2021,A_Different_Drummer,9," Review by the numbers
","1. In the UK, unlike in the US, it always been common to have single creators known for their ability to generate consistent hi-quality dramas. Steven Moffat comes to mind. He has been creating hits since the 1980s. In the US, the nearest thing we have to a creator of that same quality is Taylor Sheridan. Check out his IMDb bio. Props to him. He has earned it.",/review/rw8800698/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,9," Loved It!
","As a big Yellowstone fan I was really looking forward to 1883 and I was not disappointed! Taylor Sheridan has created another hit show! The cast was even better than I thought. I was a little worried about Tim McGraw and Faith Hill but they were both terrific. Sam Elliot was as great as always and Isabel May is a star in the making. For the people complaining about the language and violence...it's a show for adults so relax. I love everything about this show, the acting, writing, directing, production, cinematography, etc are all excellent!! If you're a fan of Yellowstone or even a western fan in general then this is a must watch!",/review/rw8800698/?ref_=tt_urv

","I haven't seen anything of ""Yellowstone"" yet, but I thought that, as that is set in present day, I'd probably be able to watch a prequel series set over a hundred years earlier without much fear of mixing the context. I do like Taylor Sheridan's work, particularly ""Hell or High Water"" so when this appeared near the top of my Paramount Plus service, I felt confident giving it a go. It's an excellent limited series, full of wonderful performances and does make me interesting in watching the main series.",/review/rw8800698/?ref_=tt_urv

27 October 2022,TxMike,," 'You can't believe in Heaven then be sad when people go there.'
","This recently became available, all ten episodes, on a set of four DVDs. I found the set at my public library. There is a scene in the first episode, as a large group of people and wagons are gathering, for their trek to the North and West. They are gathering on the Trinity River outside Fort Worth, Texas, and one person is offering condolences for the husband's death. She responds, ""You can't believe in Heaven then be sad when people go there."" I had never heard it put that way before.",/review/rw8800698/?ref_=tt_urv

",I just watched all of Yellowstone in a week and then started this series. Even after the first episode I was enthralled. It is even better than Yellowstone.,/review/rw8800698/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,nobletraveler,10," Amazing - Deep - Amazing
","Haven't seen Yellowstone yet. But started with this Mini-Series. I was emotionally blown away. It grabbed me and held me all night binge watching. This needs to be awarded Best Mini-Series at the Emmys for 2023. It also should give Isabel May Best Actress, Sam Elliott Best Actor, Faith Hill Best Supporting Actress, Tim McGraw or LaMonica Garrett as best Supporting Actor. The whole cast should be awarded Best Ensemble. The Writing should win as well as Direction. This Mini-Series was really nothing sort of a 10 - Total Perfection and realism. Very corse language, but that was how real life was back then. Violent? Yes. Gut Wrenching in parts? Yes, but again the trails going out west was not a joy ride, but an extreme challenge - I highly recommend this show and will continue on with 1923 and Yellowstone. To the Television Academy - Take notice for 2023. 1883 should do a sweep if you really do honor ""Performances"" instead of being ""politically correct"".",/review/rw8800698/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,fraser-simons,10," A masterpiece.
","Sheridan has been on my auto watch list for a while. Sicario and Wind River, to some degree Yellowstone, have all been exceptional. This, however, is pretty flawless. This feels like Lonesome Dove (the novel, never saw the adaptations) only with a female narrator that leans on some nature writing that feels like Annie Dillard. The combination is entrancing.",/review/rw8800698/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2021,jaimemedina-36288,10," Absolutely beautiful
","There's not much more to say other than that 1883 is quite simply some of the best television that has ever been produced. From the writing, to the cast, to the cinematography, every minute is a joy to watch.",/review/rw8800698/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2021,boggie4758,9," Epic
","I usually wait until the 4th episode before I write a review or rate a series. I don't need to do so with this series. Such a sprawling story, rich, gritty, sad, hardship. A epic story that has all the elements that make a series great. I love a good western..this is a great western....some one said it was a Lonesome Dove feel to it and I agree..what made Lonesome Dove great was the excellent story telling and this one has the same elements to it..great writing and fine acting. I love the daughter's voice tell the story it adds a depth to the story. This will be one of my favorites just like Yellowstone is. I was worried how this series would be because Yellowstone is so good..but, this series it top notch..",/review/rw8800698/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,lambiepie-2,9," A TV Western One Could Get Into
","I have not watched Yellowstone. My interest in Westerns was limited from Gunsmoke and the Riffleman as a toddler because my Dad was a western tv fanatic. For my interests in Westerns, movies like The Unforgiven, Tombstone, Good Bad, and the Ugly, Hang 'em High, etc., and my 'guilty pleasure' episode of the old Twilight Zone episodes called 'The Grave.' I wasn't a fan of the tv 'soap opera' Westerns. However, this has caught my interest.",/review/rw8800698/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,namritjoshi,10," E10 Touched my soul - Father & Daughter.
","This is one of the best in this genre and the one that made me cry full if emotions in a long long time! The way last 2 episodes shaped wasnt as expected considering the ruthlessness of the journey the series showcased. The series begins with a harsh journey and ends with love, what exactly is heaven and happiness in ones life. When the captain says - she outlived us all in last 6 months, it tells us thats its all about the journey and how much makes the most out of it. Am in shock that this did not received any acting emmy nominations. TimMcgraw and sam elliot were easy nominations atleast if we are not talking about the win!",/review/rw8800698/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2021,mstaffordca,10," So good I was heartbroken when the first episode ended!
","Just amazing! This group behind Yellowstone and 1883 are just so amazing I can't thank you all enough for putting out a series that we can really dig into and enjoy! I was so enthralled I never wanted it to end. I only wish I could binge the whole season RIGHT NOW. Please keep making series like these. Emotional, heartfelt, relatable, and with so much depth and character! Spectacular acting! I could go on and on! Just WOW thank you. These are the people who should be winning the awards for best series, best script/writing, best acting etc. Etc. A huge thank you.",/review/rw8800698/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2023,gouw,9," Better then Yellowstone
","I shouldn't compare though. Yellowstone is like a dallas 2.0. This is something like ""How the west was won"" 2.0. Before watching I thought it would be about the hardships of starting a ranch in the 19th century. It isn't at all. It's a roadtrip. With a good story, good acting, directing and obvious good production. Getting a feel of how hard it was for people in that time. And also how beautiful simplicity can be. The basis of this series feels realistic.",/review/rw8800698/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2023,Money4Nothing,9," The best show of 2022 with one flaw
","So this is by far the best show of 2022 and probably amongst top 5 in the last decade. It shows us a subjects that's rarely covered in movies, which is story about settlers in the USA, and all the struggles they were facing. It's very interesting and intriguing and there isn't a single boring moment in any of those 10 episodes. Acting is very good too, especially Sam Eliott who is pretty much the perfect actor for his role
The only flaw that really annoyed me and why I rate it 9 instead of 10 stars is this coming of age story which feels COMPLETELY out of place given the rest of the story... I mean you have only 10 episodes to show us people who travel for 5 months across the USA wilderness, and with so many things to cover you decide to dedicate 1/3 of it to a teenage girl who falls in love with every man she sees on that trip? So many important and interesting things were left out in order to show us something that nobody who wanted to see a western adventure was interested in.",/review/rw8800698/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2022,nancyhotz,6," Good start, then...
","It really started strong, but then developed into nothing more than the young narrator's story, which became tiresome. Her character became annoying and much better potential storylines were not developed. Too bad.",/review/rw8800698/?ref_=tt_urv

","Pure eye candy and therefor i just couldn't stop watching. That said I wish the story was more about the pioneers instead of about Elsa's coming of age and her Hollywood smile, even up to her death. Same about the other characters whom didn't seem to physically change during their months long trip.",/review/rw8800698/?ref_=tt_urv

20 December 2021,terrylarosa,10," Finally a good Western
","Been a while since Hell on Wheels. Most of the actors are perfectly cast: especially McGraw and the quintessential movie cowboy: Sam Elliot. Outstanding also is the daughter. Great action, vistas and authenticity. Plus no twirling horses. We did have a despicable Beth like character but that's not an issue anymore. The people stating this show is just about killing people must have read the Sesame Street version of the old West and should stick to watching that so they're not left a quivering mess as to how it once was just a scant century plus ago. Incidentally I don't own a gun nor wish to. Now that Sheridan has apparently thrown in the towel with the now almost unwatchable Yellowstone we can sit back and watch a good old fashioned shoot em up Western.",/review/rw8800698/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,anaryanwilliams,9," Fantastic Series
","I've been wanting to watch a good old western type of movie/series and this filled that craving in every way. The casting was great with all the characters, Tim McGraw was surprisingly good as was Sam Elliot (as always). The story line and plot was a nice, slow burn with plenty of action and scenes that bring to life the perilous journey of the Oregon trail. Taylor Sheridan's focus on the details can be felt throughout with the carefully done cinematography and musical score.",/review/rw8800698/?ref_=tt_urv
