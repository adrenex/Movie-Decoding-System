7 February 2012,PartialMovieViewer,10," Glad I Did Not Avoid This One
","THIS SHOW IS CANCELLED - AND WHY????? It usually takes anywhere from a few shows to a few seasons for a program to catch my interest. The family sat down to watch the first episode and I was about ready to wander into another room and watch, 'The History Channel.' (Why, 'The History Channel', they don't show anything dealing with history anymore.) One of my family members asked me to hang out for a bit – am I glad they did. This show is not serious at all; it's fun and funny; it is original and there is no subliminal lefty-in-your-face message. I know – I know – people are bound to disagree with me. Oh well. 'The Finder', is a crazy show, about a crazy guy, in a crazy environment and has one of the craziest (and interesting) talentshe finds stuff. Like most shows, a strong supporting cast is important and this show is no different. What a cast? The two women are super and are always in the mix – but Michael Clarke Duncan – what hoot? Talk about a valuable character. He is the glue that binds the whole show together. To the writers, directors and producers – please don't mess this show up. Awesome job!",/review/rw5302805/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2012,kuluvas,10," Great Shows Always Get Canceled
","Great Shows Always Get Canceled, Why you might ask ? Because most of this great country is retarded, They watch garbage like The real(fake) House wives of Slut city or Anything else that's called reality but is less realistic than a most fictional story's. Full of Artificially Colored, Sweetened, Flavored and Produced People that aren't Nearly as smart as my dog. This show is witty, extremely well written, directed and preformed, it's a fantastic concept and I think the best spin-off since N.C.I.S. Incredibly entertaining and quirky with a hint of Intelligent sarcasm ! I think that the reason most shows like this are canceled is because they are to smart for most of the viewing public so they turn to shows about 16 yo mothers that are more concerned about their hair than their kids. So Keep Failing Fellow American Viewers I'm sure they will make a ton of great shows for you to cancel !",/review/rw5302805/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2012,csymin,10," LOVE the Finder
","I love this show -- and the new cast is, in my opinion, far better than the one-off prequel which introduced the show as it spun off from Bones. Geoff Stultz character is played brilliantly as is the whole supporting cast. Even Eric Roberts' gnarly turn as gypsy boss was excellently cast. Where did the writers' come up with this? I thought it far more original than anything else around (I'm sick of your typical CSI crime dramas) with lots of humor to go along with the clever scripts. Having just learned the show did not get renewed, I'm once again so annoyed at myself for giving Fox a chance. They seem to cancel everything I've ever liked and renew all the crap. Too bad. This cast, these writers, this concept were all awesome. I sure hope some other network picks them up. Fox infuriates me.",/review/rw5302805/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2012,cshook42-267-72623,10," Funny, witty and keeps you guessing
","Great show with a great cast that work well together. We love the way ""The Finder"" puts things together. This is a very different series, it keeps you guessing as the ""The Finder"" goes on the hunt. It also gives you enough clues to put things together yourself. The characters are ones you want to pull for to do the right thing and you find yourself caring about how things work out for them. I am also happy to see Micheal Clark Duncan in this series, his character brings the right balance to the finder. We just hope it can stick around for a while and we will not lose ""The Finder"". Give it a look, you won't be disappointed.",/review/rw5302805/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2012,lamont-hard,8," Something Different
","This series appears to be just a bit different. We have the adviser guy with a religious soul, a juvenile bad girl, with sleazy family issues, and a FBI woman who helps with protection and provides muscle for the finder. Our main guy seems to be one who is off the rails and kind of quirky he can find anything he wants to find for the sake of closure for his clients or in the name of justice. I don't think many of us has seen this before.",/review/rw5302805/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2012,fractal-auctions-278-621772,10," Great Show on my Do Not Miss List
","First off, if there was a way to give 20 stars I would. After years of CSI type shows, this is a breath of fresh air. The plots have unusual twists and the cast performs admirably.",/review/rw5302805/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2012,giggedyguy,10," VERY funny!
","I liked bones, but I hardly ever watched it. My roommates love it and can't miss an episode. So when I heard about a spin off I was mildly curious. After reading about the plot I had to see it. I wasn't just happy that I did but I was ecstatic about it. Geoff Stults especially had my roommate and I rolling on the floor in episode 4. There are so many good shows to watch (none of them are on TNT IMO) and this is a must see for me.",/review/rw5302805/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2012,uffb,10," Great characters, great stories.
","This is one of the best TV series out there. A very entertaining comedic drama... The regular characters are simply beautiful souls. The Finder's ""Legal Adviser"" stands out in this respect, but the other character each have their endearing quirks and come across as people anyone would love to have as a friend. Combine that with a quirky and engaging story line, and you have a series which is consistently one of the most entertaining and engaging things on TV these days. Sometimes the Rube Goldberg devices Walter creates to help his thought processes are clearly impossible for one person to create in under a month, but aside from the suspension of disbelief required for that, this series is essentially flawless.",/review/rw5302805/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2012,dst-thomas,7," This show was basically ignored to death.
","I really enjoyed this show. It wasn't the best show ever, but I liked the stories and I liked the characters. It was stultifying to see Fox push this off the Thursday night schedule in order to make room for more American Idol, etc. I can't stand those shows. ""The Boy With the Bucket"", the season (now series) finale was the best episode by far. It was filled with the most sentiment since ""The Conversation"", the episode that referred back to Leo's daughter's birthday present. (The emotional energy of that episode was stretched a bit thin, but Leo's character had the strength to pull it through for me...) In ""The Boy With the Bucket"" we got to meet Walter's brother and parents, and many a tear was shed. It brought everything to a wonderful head and blew almost everyone's world apart, leaving Leo to be Leo - either the old Leo or the new Leo, either to try to pick up the pieces and make sense out of what happened and help get Walter out of the hole, or move on with his life and be callous and firm. I get it that this show was not high brow and that it was uneven and unashamed to bring in the most spectacular absurdities. It had wonderful potential, and the series finale, ""The Boy With the Bucket"", showed how enjoyable an episode could be when it rose to meet that potential. The choice to use ""Is it like today?"", one of my favorite songs, for the soundtrack over scenes of Willa hitch hiking and trying to escape Shad nicely summed up the mood of the episode and now sadly, the series. (you can easily find the lyrics on the web - lyricstime.com/world-party-is-it-like-today- lyrics.html)",/review/rw5302805/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2012,dreamweb-277-133250,10," Love it
","The show is just good, fun entertainment. Sometimes it's nice to be entertained and not have to think things through. I love the cast, great chemistry all around.",/review/rw5302805/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2012,graham-mcfarlane,9," Fantastic
","This hit the spot. I have not loved a show this much since i first discovered NCIS. When i discovered today that it was cancelled i felt as if someone has died. I actually went online to order box set, but no point now. This is LIFE(another cancelled show) all over again. Fox get your act together and make stuff real people want to watch not teenagers too many reality shows and not enough good wholesome clean fun like The Finder. P.S I've filled in the petition. And yes i loved Bones but gave up after series 3 , this is much better and could easily go another 3 or 4 series. The actors are brill and all work well together, you get a real sense of 'family' from them a cop, a soldier a lawyer and a thief. I also love the way the show has action, laughs, and trivia, you learn something new from this every show. Law, life, science, art, i could go on.",/review/rw5302805/?ref_=tt_urv

7 May 2012,Fitzniryk,10," The Finder is My Favorite Show!!!
","The Finder is such a unique show and it is absolutely hilarious. The story lines are amazing and very clever. The show is sooo unpredictable. Perfect example, one episode starts out with Walter trying to find ""a meal"" for a client. The chaos that ensues from that point on is brilliant. It builds and builds and goes off in completely unpredictable directions. Oh, by the way, that is a good thing. The banter between Walter and Leo is awesome and all the characters are very well developed. I have been waiting a long time for a show like this. To the people at Fox: I never really watched Bones, however, since discovering the Finder I have started to watch Bones as well. I still like the Finder way better, but going in this new direction is drawing new audience members to your other shows.",/review/rw5302805/?ref_=tt_urv

12 May 2012,cjennings2853,10," Love this show
",This show is original and thoroughly entertaining. It is smart and funny. The characters are very original and very easy to get involved with. I look forward to Friday nights for the new episodes! Walter is very convincing and funny to watch. Willa is a wayward girl trying to find her place in the world outside of her controlling gypsy family. Leo is smart and a good man trying to make up for his past. Isabel is a good influence on Walter and has a great body!!! Timo needs to join Willa in trying to be a better person and get away from the family so he can be with his true love. I really enjoy the episodes where the Bones crew join the finder cast. I can't wait to see what happens next!,/review/rw5302805/?ref_=tt_urv

","I can't believe the show has been canceled! I've never written one of these reviews before, but that is how strongly I feel about the loss of this show! I loved the Finder. It was original and funny -so different that the typical ""solve the crime"" shows. ",/review/rw5302805/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2012,TheJayde,10," Cancel Bones - Keep The Finder

31 May 2012,alnnmay3,10," The Finder needs to comeback!
","It is not often that one can find good television during prime time that can be watched by everyone in the family. Even shows aired on the widely received channels of NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX, and CW often push the risky behaviors of drugs, alcohol, violence, cussing, and sex by testing the limits on how much can be shown or said. Some of the highest rated non-reality television shows on the tube today are often off limits in households with younger children. TGIF was once defined as a family hour (or two) enjoying an episode of Full House, Family Matters, Star Search, etc The television that is available today in these same time slots no longer inspire family viewing. Even some of the less risky shows one can find on many of these networks still portray enough blood, guts, violence and sex to make them inappropriate for younger viewers. So when a show like The Finder (starring Geoff Stults, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Maddie Hasson) comes along it may take a while for it to be recognized for what it is correction, was: good wholesome family television.",/review/rw5302805/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2012,crazyladymaddox,10," Can't wait for more!
","When we saw the episode for the finder on Bones we immediately said how great it would be for them to have their own show. Then when it did show up this season we were ecstatic! And I must say we were not disappointed! Walter couldn't be a more perfect mix of crazy, smart, mysterious and likable. And Leo is great! A perfect tough tank of a man with a soft heart and pulls it off wonderfully. The chemistry between Walter and Isabelle is a fun sidenote in the show. I do miss the Brit that was in the Bones episode but Isabel is nice too. I really like Willa as well. She brings a young vibe with a funny smart- butt teenage attitude while still being likable and endearing. I truly hope this series is renewed. I think it would be a mistake not to! Hey, FOX pay attention! RENEW THIS SERIES!!!!",/review/rw5302805/?ref_=tt_urv

30 September 2018,stableladyhawke-19141,10," Crazy good... and no one noticed.
",This series stays as one of my favorite! I'm still devastated that the demise of Michael Duncan Clark forced the decision to cancel this great show. It was quirky like northern exposure. It had a great cast blend like Night Court. It had intelligence in the writing! It was in a weird time slot and most people never even knew it was a show. I think everyone who actually saw two episodes all the way through was hooked! I still ponder the blackboard quotes!!!,/review/rw5302805/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2016,gagentry,9," Loved it - right up to the end
","I loved this show. I assume that the last episode was to be followed up by a new season - then Michael Clarke Duncan died. I was so devastated by all that was going on, the sudden disintegration of the characters that I had grown to care about. There was so much chemistry between all the cast members. I gained a real appreciation for new actors. The episodes were intriguing and dangerous - without being bloody or really scary. I am sure that there was filming for more episodes - just look at the opening sequences. I sure wish that they would make adjustments for Michael's character and continue on. He was a great actor - I'm not suggesting he wasn't, but I loved the writing and energy. Oh, well, I enjoyed it immensely while it was on.",/review/rw5302805/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2019,A_Different_Drummer,9," The Dying of the Light
","Basically the poster child for the pre-streaming ""network"" cable model of TV. Which, as of the date of this review, is pretty much dead. There were some really fun things about this show -- including Maddie Hasson -- but there were also many sour beats even in the early episodes. As if the writers, like the character they created, could never decide what they really wanted. If you decide to binge the series, skip the last episode -- the Finale from Hell -- because by then the show knew it was doomed and the producers seemed determined to go full tilt schizo and give viewers the finger.",/review/rw5302805/?ref_=tt_urv
