21 October 2022,liammarklh,6," This should have been a TV series
","Ever since I saw the teaser trailer for this movie, my inner book fan was squealing with joy. I've been waiting for this series to get adapted for the longest time. I was excited to see what they were going to do with this series and how they could improve upon it or highlight what made it so good.",/review/rw8622775/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2022,star_hazard,8," Campy colorful fairytale story about friendship
","I've never read the books this was based on so I cannot comment if it's faithful or accurate.. I tuned in because I saw Cate, Charlize, and Laurence in the casting. It wasn't a masterpiece but it did deliver a good light hearted fantasy story.",/review/rw8622775/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2022,raven-11881,8," An unexpectedly good film
","After an esteemed user of an esteemed community immediately threw in the towel, I had my doubts about the film. When I saw that the running time was 148 minutes, I was even more skeptical. Would I be able to sit through it? But I got curious and just started the movie, even though I actually wanted to go to bed. Well, what can I say? I easily made it to the end and in the end I didn't even think the movie was that long. Just now, as I was writing these lines here, I read the fresh review from my favorite movie site and was horrified.... by myself. Can it be that I like such a cheesy movie with partly bad effects? Am I abnormal? Even the ratings on IMDB say it's a bad movie. Well, I see it a bit different. But let's start from the beginning.",/review/rw8622775/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2022,jeetacsocial,8," A Low score for this movie is hilarious.

19 October 2022,IonicBreezeMachine,7," Doesn't stray far from the YA fantasy mold, but it does have fun with it
","Lifelong friends Agatha (Sofia Wylie) and Sophie (Sophia Anne Caruso) have been lifelong friends in their village of Gavaldon with Sophie Agatha's only friend due to unfounded rumors of Agatha and her mother being a witch. Sophie dreams of being a princess like in the fairy tale stories she's obsessed with, and after learning of the School for Good and Evil which trains the heroes and villains of the various stories that inspire mankind Sophie wishes to be enrolled in the school. Sophie initially plans to leave Gavaldon due to tensions with her family but is confronted by Agatha who tries to convince her otherwise. The two are pulled into the forest by a specter and taken by a bird to the School for Good and Evil but Agatha is dropped on the ""good"" side while Sophie is dropped on the ""evil"" against her protests she's actually good. Agatha reluctantly goes under the tutilidge of the Good school's dean Professor Dovey (Kerry Washington) while Sophie likewise is taught by Lady Lesso (Charlize Theron). Both Agatha and Sophie ask the School Master (Laurence Fishburne) to correct the mistake, but he says it's out of his power and only ""true love's kiss"" is powerful enough to change anything. Meanwhile, Agatha sees the spectre of the supposedly long dead brother of the School Master, Rafal (Kit Young), who has insidious plans involving Sophie. As Sophie and Agatha work their way through the school, divisions form between them with their mutual affections over Tedros (Jamie Flatters) the son of King Arthur.",/review/rw8622775/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,filmmakersis,8," Fun with great art direction
","Fun to watch with my older kids, never really boring. Some cheesy moments but nothing in comparison to how cheesy and unbearable Descendants is so if you have to pick one go with THIS one. Fantastic art direction and costuming also really brings the whole vibe of the story together. And having some famous older actors we love was a very nice touch too and they seem to be having fun in their roles in this. The only issue I had is that this is a fairy tale theme not in the real world yet one of the main characters says ""Oh my God"" about 24 times in a 3 min span like as typical teenager when she's freaking out over her friend being hurt near the end. I don't know if this was a misstep, clearly the actress was adlibbing and that is what she would have said in real life, but it's kind of hilarious because you're definitely taken out of the storybook fairy tale land here. Not a complaint, it's just really funny when they're literally in medieval fairy gowns and she's like ""oh my god, like oh my god, like, oh my god.."" had me and my kids cracking up. But yeah, we loved it honestly.",/review/rw8622775/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2022,carlagsanchezperez,5," It was okay, a lot of lost potential
","This movie had a lot of potential. The story is original, and the costumes and cast are amazing. I really think it could of been a great movie if it wasn't so rushed/speedran. Its rush to crunch as many things as possible genuinely ruined the movie and its characters.",/review/rw8622775/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2022,nadyaknops,7," Guilty Pleasure Movie for Teenagers
",I never read the books so I can't tell how accurate the adaption is. This Netflix production is definitely not the best but also not the worst fantasy movie. It's like a typical Nickelodeon/Disney channel production (with better effects and costumes) in my feeling and I think it will find it's audience.,/review/rw8622775/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2022,trapp_33,5," Netflix up's and down's again
","At first I thought for a moment that it will be good, but it let me down, Its like I saw the disapointment coming. The story was fine yet the plot was a disaster, there is nothing in the middle that will have your attention, they go and come on the same point (they didn't move on). The motion picture was pleasent, not completely good and not completely bad. The characters were intresting in some point but there intentions was bedim and not clear, they want something in point and keeps changing it, like there is one character who changed her intentions 5 or 7 times I dont realy remember because it wasn't convincing me.",/review/rw8622775/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,tinyone2,1," The very best part of this film, was the fact that it ended.

14 November 2022,stevelivesey67,2," Harry Potter rip-off with added diversity and complete lack of talent
",I suppose if I had lived under a rock for the last twenty years and never seen Harry Potter then this may come across as new and inventive. Watching now it just seems like someone has just copied Potter and changed just enough to not get sued by JK Rowling.,/review/rw8622775/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2022,spanomarkouareti,3," Failure sorry
","The direction is awful, it's like cheap series in the 00s. The dialogues are childish, but not for children. The blonde protagonists has a duckface from lip fillers and she cannot express. The costumes are bearable. The story is very shallow and you really can't follow. I cannot believe they got such great actors to play in this absurdity, it's amazing that they accepted to participate. Also there mustn't be any kind of preparation or research before creating the screenplay, as they mistakenly say that Hercules was a fairytale but he was a real person in antiquity. The light is only good for the evil school, and for the good school is no light design at all. Wish they sent this money on upcoming filmmakers, they would have done it better.",/review/rw8622775/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2022,karinahatem,1," Baaaaaaaaaaaad
","It is not enough that Netflix continues producing bad movies, but this time, they are casting more and more famous and good actors; as if trying to raise the bar higher and higher on how bad a movie can be. Please Netflix, having all those award winning actors, won't make the movie any good. Such a waste for all the good actors. This was so bad, that I could only manage to watch around 40 minutes, very poor rather silly performance, stupid dialogue, bad action scenes, even the visual effects were bad. Also, this movie was way too dark to be suitable for kids
Dear Netflix, pls focus on making original tv series, and pls stop making bad movies.",/review/rw8622775/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was bad. To everyone rating this an 8 or higher - you all have been watching too many bad films to even think this was good. I dont know where to begin. I know the two lead characters were supposed to be special but they were just not. I can list down what i think made this movie cringy that i sometimes found myself physically flinching

22 October 2022,bowieec,4," I'd never used the playback speed up feature on Netflix... until this movie
","This was a convoluted mess. It felt like they tried to throw everything an audience might like into one movie and hope for the best. It didn't work for me. Sofia Wylie as Agatha and Charlize Theron as Lady Lesso were the highlights - well cast and fun to watch. Laurence Fishburne was good as always. Kerry Washington and Michelle Yeoh were either miscast or phoning it in. They're both great actors so it's hard to tell what went wrong. But most everybody else, including some very talented actors, just missed the mark completely. After trying and failing to finish this movie over three and a half days, I loaded Netflix on my PC so I could use the high speed play not available on my Roku to just finish the darn thing. And that ending was horrendous. The attempted positive messaging on the power of friendship and female empowerment were undermined by everything else in the film.",/review/rw8622775/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2022,AngryBaneling,3," Netflix is allergic to faithful adaptations of source material.
","I watched the trailer for this movie and thought it was good, and sadly, that's the only good thing about it. The School for Good and Evil is a chore from start to finish, and I didn't find one redeeming aspect in any of it. Not the story, the characters, or the world itself. The cringeworthy dialogue, the cast, and the cheap costumes are all inexcusably bad. I haven't read the source material, but it can't be that bad if the author sold enough books to write a second and a third book in the franchise. So after watching the film, I went through some reviews written by fans of the book series to see if they liked it. Alas, it's a tale as old as Netflix is as a company. What happened here is what always happens with Netflix adaptations. They bravely delivered on their promise to the butcher the source material, whether it be a series of books, anime, or video games.",/review/rw8622775/?ref_=tt_urv

20 October 2022,trident-39079,1," Almost unwatchable
","Sofia Wylie and Jamie Flatters are the only performances providing any redemption to this movie. Fishburne, Washington, and Theron give the worst performances of their careers. The supporting cast doesn't support at all. Even those with no lines can't seem to act at all. If Paul Feig is given another directing job after this it will be a case of charity. The dialogue is ripped from a collection of stale fortune cookies. Even the special effects look like some 10 year old did them at home on their home computer. I only watched it to the end so I could have bragging rights that I was able to survive the entire viewing.",/review/rw8622775/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2022,magnoliacream,8," Fantastical tale about friendship
","Agatha (Sofia Wylie) and Sophie (Sophia Anne Caruso) are outsiders in Gavaldon, making Sophie long to get out of the village. After hearing about the School for Good and Evil, where fairytale heroes and villains are groomed, Sophie was adamant about going there. Agatha tagged along with her best friend but they got dropped unto different sides of the school. Will their friendship survive the rivalry between their groups, not to mention their rivalry over School for Good hunk Tedros (Jamie Flatters)?",/review/rw8622775/?ref_=tt_urv

20 October 2022,rabaaltamimi,5," missed opportunity
","The lead actors in this movie were sub-par, average at best and some acting felt very forced especially from co-actors. Despite high caliber actresses like Charlize and actor L. Fishburne, they could not save this movie. Kerry Washington was very flat despite having more screen presence than other big stars. The CGI was somehow TV movie level! I actually thought this was a TV movie! I didn't read the books but I hate how similar and cliche some of these stories are becoming. I have read the ""Nevermore"" series and this had many similarities. And I just hated the choice of intrusive music, made it very hard to connect to anything going on and way out of supposed timeline. Made for a long silly afternoon. Loved Charlize though and Michelle Yeoh despite her limited presence.",/review/rw8622775/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie brings terrible to a new level, a level that no one ever dared to image. If you like watching bad movies, this is the crème de la crème.
