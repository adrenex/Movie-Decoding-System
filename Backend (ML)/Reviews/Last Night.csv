11 July 2015,AlsExGal,7," A pleasant little romantic comedy
","I really liked the original better - 1940's ""The Shop Around the Corner"". However, for a modern romantic comedy this one hits the spot. It alters the means of communication between the mismatched couple to email from letters. This film has Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) as the heir to a Borders-like bookstore empire whose family is opening a new store near his pen pal Kathleen Kelly's (Meg Ryan) small children's' bookstore. It is the same as its predecessor in that the pen pals actually know each other and do not like each other. It alters the basis of the disagreement to be that of Fox's big impersonal business delivering goods at a discount with the price being a largely anonymous and unknowledgeable retail staff versus Kelly's personal service and first editions that carries a large price tag for the paying customers. It turns out that, even in Manhattan, people prefer to buy discount with the result being the end of Kathleen's store. The movie keeps things interesting with several little side stories and unanswered questions. Did Joe's grandfather ever date Kathleen's mother? Did Kathleen's employee Birdie (Jean Stapleton) have an affair with Francisco Franco in her youth? Why and how did Birdie decide to buy all of that Intel stock? Then there is the whole issue of Joe's serially monogamous dad (Dabney Coleman) that plays out quite humorously and the fact that Joe has an aunt that is thirty years younger than he is. Considering Joe's mother had to be a victim of his father's philandering at some point, Joe seems to take his dad's personal habits quite casually. A very moving addition to this version of the story is Kathleen's identification of the store with her mother to the point that, when the store does finally close, she considers it to be much like her mother dying all over again.",/review/rw3836766/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2003,clydestuff,8," ""Chemistry, likeable characters make this film work""
","In films like You've Got Mail, where you can almost predict how it's going to turn out as soon as the opening credits appear, then it is up to the writers, director, and actors, to get us to enjoy the journey to the end credits. Nora and Delia Ephron's script succeeds because they know their characters well, and give them a can't miss plot device.  Tom Hanks is believable as the head of a gigantic bookstore chain, as is Meg Ryan as the owner of a small children's bookstore shop.  As the guy who is putting Meg out of business by opening a chain store close to her little shop, Tom Hanks character comes across as the arrogant person who only goal seems to open as many bookstores as he can, and make as much money as he can in doing so. When he is talking to Meg Ryan on the internet, we see another side of him, and learn that possibly, he's not the evil guy you think he is.  Of course, in person, Meg hates him for what he is doing, on the internet, she falls in love with him.  This is what makes the film work, as their reaction to each other in person is completely different from when they talk on line.  Some people may quibble that the ending is not very believable, but face it, do you fall in love with a person because of who they are, or what you think they are?  I think this question is answered quite adequately.",/review/rw3836766/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2004,mosmanic,," You've got something most of us like
","Romantic comedies are not everyone's cup of tea; after all, who would want to watch unrealistic stories about ordinary people 'coupling' when we are offered such wonderful everyday experiences as ten car pileups, hordes of people being slaughtered in a hail of bullets while shopping, goblins, explosions, vampires and intergalactic spaceships?",/review/rw3836766/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 1999,Altaira,," Cute, sugary, but ultimately worth it
","I'm not usually drawn to the stereotypical ""cute chick flick,"" but while You've Got Mail unabashedly falls into this category, I still loved it. Mail is a clever story, cleverly acted by Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.  I enjoyed it more than their last joint project, Sleepless in Seattle simply because the immensely likeable pair were onscreen together so much more. Some will dub the movie predictable and sappy, but hey, I wasn't looking for deep psychology, just a friendly feel good.  If that's what you're after, Mail delivers. Hanks and Ryan have the greatest onscreen chemistry I've seen, and the last half hour of the film is right on target.  While the happy ending was inevitable, I was curious to discover exactly how it would occur. Sugar-coated it was, but charming and thoroughly enjoyable!!! A few bits of dialogue were a little too cute for my taste, but overall, You've Got Mail is more sweet than sugary.",/review/rw3836766/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 1998,NPilbeam,10," One of the most romantic movies I've ever seen!!!
","I've been starved for a great romantic film and YOU'VE GOT MAIL more than sated my appetite! I'd rank it right up there with CASABLANCA as one of the most romantic movies of all time.  Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have more chemistry than a High School Science Department!   This movie was warm, funny, smart, and sexy.  Tom and Meg light up the screen and Tom Hanks is the perfect hero!  The movie was 2 hours long, felt like 10 minutes, and I didn't want it to be over!  This is a definite keeper, and I can't wait for it to come out on video so I can watch it again and again!",/review/rw3836766/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2006,moonspinner55,7," Cookie-cutter romance, but Meg Ryan radiates with charm
","Pleasant, warm-hearted fluff reworking 1940's ""The Shop Around the Corner"" (remade initially in 1949 as the musical ""In The Good Old Summertime""). Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan reteam for the second time as rival bookstore owners in New York City: she operates a Mom & Pop bookshop, he's opening another outlet in his retail chain nearby. They lock horns over business, yet are unaware they are also each other's internet pen-pal. Slick and occasionally too-cute, too cookie cutter, but also an entertaining picture nicely set during the holidays. Ryan can't help but radiate personality and charm, though Hanks is curiously rote here (and he looks tired to boot),. Terrific supporting cast certainly helps, with Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Jean Stapleton and Steve Zahn making up a bright ensemble. Engaging, if you're not too demanding. *** from ****",/review/rw3836766/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2007,aidosh94,10," Well, I honestly do not no what to say...
","...except for the fact that this movie made me so happy! I'm a huge Tom Hanks fan and I collect all of his movies, and it has been quite some time since i've seen a really good and special movie of his. He's just such a wonderful actor and Meg Ryan's just... Well, she's just so great, always happy and when she's acting she always makes me laugh, cause she's just so wonderful! Let's talk about this movie: I'm gonna be honest with you, this isn't Forrest Gump or The Green Mile, but it is romantic, special, wonderful and it made me smile and wish for them to get together in the film, and in the end I was just happier then before! I think it's underrated, but everyone has a special taste, and I just loved it! I seriously recommend it to every Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan fan, you are not going to regret it! Thank you for your time.",/review/rw3836766/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2019,el7,6," Ironic in Hindsight
","You've Got Mail represents the tail end of the golden era of romantic comedies, during which writers and directors were trying to get an angle that would work for a more cynical movie-going public. Nora Ephron, with her rapier wit which she often hid within a cinematographic soft glove, was one of the more successful filmmakers of the later period. This film is a remake of The Shop Around the Corner from an earlier rom com era, so there are layers to the references in this movie, and if you catch them all, some of them are quite ironic. Especially the unintended ones, though. The script updates the story of the big retailer putting the small retailer out of business even as the two proprietors fall in love by recasting the retail stores as bookstores (this was actually a very big deal in the 90s) and the pen pals are corresponding via email rather than snail mail this time around. Looking at this film all these years later, you can't help but marvel at the fact that the filmmakers had written a romance about a big box bookseller winning the girl by utilizing a tool that was destined to put him out of business one day. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan both have a great deal of personal charm individually and solid chemistry together, so the movie works on that level. Some aspects of the film aged less well than others. For example, the opening scenes that show Hanks and Ryan seeing their lovers off to start their days, and then sneaking back to their laptops to emote at each other via email, are played as cute hijinks, when today their actions would be recognized as an emotional affair. It's immediately clear that neither one is involved with a suitable lover, and then those lovers very conveniently (and somewhat ironically) develop a connection with each other, but still. This movie is somewhat of a time capsule, and still worth a watch with that in mind. Hanks and Ryan do a better job of selling the idea that these two can overcome his rampant trampling on her livelihood through their personal connection to each other much more successfully than the script manages to do.",/review/rw3836766/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 1998,Clare-5,9," This movie was so much more than I expected.
","This movie was so much better than I expected, which was a simple romantic comedy with predictable ""pass each other in the street"" scenarios throughout.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a love story that touched my heart.  Kathleen's vulnerability and pride in her mother made me cry and Joe's sensitivity and devious behavior were so very sweet.",/review/rw3836766/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2005,SRVforever,10," Unbelievable film! Such a warmth and happiness!
","I'm from Germany and I love this film! It makes me happy to just watch it! When watching this film one comes to think why in real life such beauty in words and moments can't be achieved! The film does'nt get boring, even if watched for the 23rd time! It's pure magic - you could endlessly listen to the conversations, the beautiful music and enjoy the excellent acting! Other films try to come in too trendy with freaky music and sexual content(not that there's anything wrong with that) - but it's not a feelgood movie! Besides the puns and the lovely warm hearted atmosphere does the rest! To everyone who hasn't yet seen this movie - rent it, buy it - enjoy it!",/review/rw3836766/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 1999,len-21,9," 9 on a scale of 10

15 August 2000,Rowsdower,," One little comment
","This was an all right movie, but can I make just one little observation? If the movie is trying to make a social statement about big book chains with no personality (like Hank's Fox Books) greedily driving the little stores with charm (like Ryan's Shop around the Corner) out of business, how is it that the filmmakers chose to put every other scene in a Starbucks? Starbucks has undoubtedly forced more little shops out of business that any big book chain has.",/review/rw3836766/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 1999,BChase,9," Great movie, great performances, great music!
","I was pleasantly surprised to find ""Mail"" not to be a rehash of ""Sleepless."" Ryan and Hanks do work exceptionally well together! Three-quarters into the movie I was wondering how they would ever pull off a romantic and yet believable ending, but the scene at the garden was one of those perfect moments in filmmaking. It just rang true and consistent with the story.",/review/rw3836766/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2012,pete36,9," I don't get it
","I don't get it :not the plot but simply the fact that this movie just gets to me. If you look at my profile and some of my movie reviews and lists you 'll notice I have a penchant for tough war movies ! Yet I can't resist YGM, the total opposite of a war movie. Is it the magnificent New York locations (does NY really look like this ?). Or is it the great script and direction by Nora Ephron (her best together with 'Sleepless'), the fact that everyone is so likable, smart and civilized (especially the two leads). Is everyone in New York like this ? Time for me to pay that city a visit (I'm from Europe)! ",/review/rw3836766/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2020,Sylviastel,8," When you read a book as a child, it becomes a part of your identity in a way that no other reading in your whole life does.
","Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks are together again in this romantic comedy as mixed match. She owns a small book store and he runs a book selling franchise. The film is charming at times with a great cast. I thought Heather Burns was also Kristin Davis. I enjoyed seeing actors like Jean Stapleton, Dabney Coleman, Steve Zahn, Dave Chappelle and others. It's a typical Nora Ephron production set and filmed in New York City's literate upper West Side neighborhood with a stop at Zabar's. Nora Ephron really made great films as well. She is sorely missed.",/review/rw3836766/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," Inferior to Sleepless in Seattle, but still an enjoyable film.
","What I liked most about Sleepless in Seattle was its wit, humour and charm. You've Got Mail has the charm and the humour evident in the performances and chemistry of the actors, however it just lacks the wit of Sleepless in Seattle. Both Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan give excellent performances, and their chemistry is believable. The supporting performances from Greg Kinnear, Jean Stapleton and Parker Posey are also impressive, if careful not to overshadow the two leads. The music is lovely, and the backgrounds of New York are especially nice to look at. The direction is good, if lacking the extra bit of sparkle that was used in Seattle, and sometimes the script and story is a tad underdeveloped. But as a romantic comedy, I really liked it, it is very sweet and good natured and it makes me feel good. So I will give it a 7.5/10. Bethany Cox",/review/rw3836766/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2000,krumski,4," An odd, distasteful little movie
","This movie is strange. Just weird. It would seem as if it's trying to be a romantic comedy, and indeed that is what it was billed and sold as (And it's based on one of the best - the 1938 film The Shop Around the Corner, starring Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan.

","One the most expressive romantic comedy of the nineties, even rooted on The Shop Around the Corner of the forties the smart director Nora Ephron who also wrote the screenplay made a rereading of the 1940's classic, bringing an update to modern days, the leading actors Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan were an old acquaintance on previous movies as Sleepers on Seattle and Joe versus the Volcano, thus the couple close this successful partnership crowning with You've Got Mail, Hanks was fabulous as always, appealing to your skillful mannerism, increasing his usual performance, Meg Ryan plays a righteous girl, wary on their principles, aside the early clash on the beginning about business, slowly will growing a mutual respect and the romance interest as well, the chemistry is glaring, also a clever humor was overtly introduced on the story, even often sometimes both are faltering is great how they overcame this barrier, charming movie, upper class almost on the same stature of ""The Shop Around the Corner""!!",/review/rw3836766/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2005,theowinthrop,10," Laszlo's Play Makes It's Third Film Appearance
","If you have been reading the last three reviews I did, this is the natural concluding review of the sequence. THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME, and SHE LOVES ME all were based (in the central plot about two people at loggerheads in physical life, falling in love through anonymity in pen-pal letters) on Miklos Laszlo's PERFUMERIE. They all had their differences in a secondary plot dealing with the jealousy of the owner of the store towards the hero (his closest employee) resulting in his firing the hero due to a serious mistake by the employer. This was jettisoned and altered in the middle film, but resumed in the Kander and Ebb musical of the 1970s (made into a television version in 1978). But that version actually gave the actual villain a parting shot in his last song, showing he was down, but not out, and would still find a way of getting an undeserved success.",/review/rw3836766/?ref_=tt_urv

The beginning of internet before it got over bearing with other nonsense, this is great mix of in person and online.
