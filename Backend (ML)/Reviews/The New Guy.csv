","What a GREAT film.
It's Kiwi to the bone, no Hollywood glitz here just an entertaining film.
To make a film like this on shoe string budget is a truly fantastic achievement. Anyone who was involved in putting this together, go ahead and give yourselves a big pat on the back.",/review/rw8448604/?ref_=tt_urv

","Housebound is really something. It's part ghost story, part People Under the Stairs, part murder mystery, part slapstick comedy and part family drama. The dialog, facial expression and spot on timing of the action keep this mash up of genres amusing every step of the way. Just when you think you know which way it's heading, it either makes fun of the standard clich√©s or skips them entirely, casting us into a twist and turn that starts it all over again with an entirely new plot development. And when you think you know where that plot line is headed, it does it again. I really enjoyed the character Amos played by Glen-Paul Waru. His bumbling energy kept me chuckling. I also enjoyed the fact that even though this film gets pretty violent and gory at times, overall it is a good-natured, feel good movie that, like a roller coaster ride, is scary and fun and shocking and harmless all at the same time. Good job Gerard Johnstone!",/review/rw8448604/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2014,Corpus_Vile,8," A surprising gem from New Zealand
","Kylie (Morgana O'Reilly) is a wild child methamphetamine & drink fueled girl who's not averse to engaging in petty crime to fund her lifestyle. One night, after her spot of smash 'n' grab badly backfires, Kylie is put under house arrest, complete with delinquent offender ankle bracelet, to live with her long suffering mother and her mother's almost permanently silent husband and has to endure being checked in on by her social worker Dennis (Cameron Rhodes) and likable security guard Amos (Glen-Paul Waru)",/review/rw8448604/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2014,voyou-703-655350,8," Cartoonish black humour and genuine suspense under the same roof.
","And these are only two of the ingredients that will make Housebound at least a cult and hopefully a classic. It's hard enough to make the public laugh, the most difficult thing to achieve in fact. Now imagine that you can never guess if the next minute will crack you up or alarm you. How much fun that is !.",/review/rw8448604/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2014,leominosa,8," Unpredictable and genuinely funny
","Delinquent serial-offender Kylie is sentenced to nine month's house arrest at her family home in a small town on New Zealand's Twin Coast Highway, forcing her to move back in after many years with her slightly loopy mother, who we learn has long been convinced that the house is haunted. Initially more than a little sceptical, Kylie soon begins to experience unexplained phenomena herself, and before long local security contractor/probation officer Amos (who is principally responsible for ensuring Kylie doesn't leave the premises) offers his services as an amateur paranormal investigator.",/review/rw8448604/?ref_=tt_urv

25 October 2014,Boris_Day,8," A horror film which also happens to be funny
","With a few exemptions I'm not a huge fan of horror comedies as they are rarely scary nor really that funny. What I like about Housebound is that it is first and foremost a horror film, which also happens to be funny. The humor develops naturally out of the situations and the characters. The gags don't feel shoehorned in and it isn't a parody of the horror genre. And in a genre where characterisation often comes as an afterthought, the characters here feel well rounded and very real.

","At first I was really skeptical about this movie due to the ""comedy"" genre. Usually I'm not much of a horror/comedy fan (being a big fan of ""pure"" horror movies). I gave this movie a try due to the positive ratings and I was not disappointed. And for anyone that is wondering... it definitely has horror elements.",/review/rw8448604/?ref_=tt_urv

","Kylie Renee Bucknell (Morgana O'Reilly) bungles an ATM robbery and gets sentenced to eight months of house arrest in her mother Miriam's (Rima Te Wiata) home. She lives there with Graeme (Ross Harper) a quiet creepy man. She has an ankle bracelet that prevents her from leaving. Mom is convinced the house is haunted and it isn't long before Kylie joins her in the belief dragging in Amos (Glen-Paul Waru) of Titan security.

24 November 2014,MattBirk,7," House of Horrors!
","'Housebound' is a very well crafted movie, mostly because it perfectly balances suspense/horror with comedic tones that laugh in the face of classic horror moments. But even with all those great comedy bits, there are quite a few creepy moments in the movie that gets your heart pounding. The story on the other hand is quite original, I won't give too much away, but it plays out like a ghost story with the main character trapped inside the house, because of a house arrest warrant. The movie is full of surprises and comical elements that keeps the somewhat darker story light at heart. Having the main character on house arrest is a nice touch that forces her to stay inside the house even though there is something sinister going on inside those walls. 'Housebound' plays out with some typical horror elements, but the main character refuses to follow suit and every time something 'unusual' happens, she tackles those situations more level headed than most horror movie characters, which creates some great humor. As I said above, I loved how the movie easily transitioned between being quite comical to some very solid scares, it also has a very strong creep factor as well! I was not expecting a whole lot going into this movie so it turned out to be quite a surprise, even though the movie certainly would have been better had it trimmed it's runtime down! And as for a warning, if you for some odd reason you struggle through the first 1/2 of the movie, just know that the 3rd act is where all the excitement and mayhem lives! This movie is along the likes of Tucker & Dale vs Evil, and although it is definitely a darker movie, it features a lot more (and welcomed) surprises!",/review/rw8448604/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2020,brockleyavenue,8," Well done New Zealand!
","This movie, has given me a new appreciation of the New Zealand movie industry.
What a surprise!... and a worthy one at that.
This was hilarious! The director/writers/actors/editors were brilliant. Some of the scenes left you laughing out loud and were so cleverly thought out.
It not your usually 'horror' theme, with the usual gore, so if you expect that, then move on.
The main character and her mother really make the movie, and as I wrote earlier, this movie opened my eyes up to the New Zealand movie trade.
I'm not going to spoil you with what it about, so the best way to watch this movie is to not know much at all, and you will be pleasantly surprised.
This movie, has been one I recommend for others to see, as its entertaining, funny, and you won't just get a smirk on your face but a good laugh out loud experience. Well done New Zealand.",/review/rw8448604/?ref_=tt_urv

","After a bungled attempt at robbing an ATM, wayward Kylie Bucknell (Morgana O'Reilly) finds herself sentenced to 8 months detention at her mother's house, a high-tech ankle bracelet raising the alarm if she should stray too far. Her childhood home is a creepy old building that her mother Miriam (Rima Te Wiata) believes to be haunted, and Kylie starts to think the same way after experiencing several inexplicable occurrences. The truth, however, is far stranger than a simple case of disgruntled ghosts: as Kylie investigates, with a little help from security man Amos ( Glen-Paul Waru), she unravels a decades old mystery surrounding an unsolved murder.",/review/rw8448604/?ref_=tt_urv

9 August 2019,gaamst,9," Extremely underrated
","Just a fantastic film, it really works on every level. It's also hard to define, because it moves so smoothly between the genres. Relatively speaking, some parts have a Tim Burton-feel to them, while others are more mystery/horror moments a la The Conjuring, but it never takes itself to seriously, which is why it all works so well. The humor is more subtle, but it's kind of like Shaun of the Dead.",/review/rw8448604/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was so skeptical of this movie. I'd just seen two bad scary movies in a row and this was another unknown. The movie starts with a misguided, angry, petulant teenager that gets sentenced to 8 months house arrest. Almost immediately she starts witnessing some paranormal events. It was at this point that I began to get annoyed and disinterested. ""Here we go. Another generic ghost/poltergeist movie."" I hung in there and I am so glad I did. ",/review/rw8448604/?ref_=tt_urv

","After the endless, mind numbing, clich√©d, regurgitated rubbish one has to sift through these days, just hoping to find something truly enjoyable and a bit original; stumbling across this great little gem returns my faith a bit. It's great to be reminded that fresh and inspired ways of telling a story ARE still out there!

","üò± First Impressions:
The box-art of the film really irks me. Maybe because at first glance it seems like a low-budget thriller that already hints at it being funny more so than scary. But at the same time, there is no deying that it is also creepy with the ghostly figure and grabbing Kylie's shoulder. Horror-comedies usually have issues with balancing the laughter and scares but lets see where it takes us...",/review/rw8448604/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2014,kupukupumu,8," Very Recommended
","I am just someone who watched tons of movies and maybe it is not my right to write a review on a title. Had this movie on very low expectation, especially the let down by Babadook, Grace the Possession, Extraterrestrial and some others. Coincidentally Housebound is another movie made by the Down Unders, other than the over-hyped Babadook. Not sure why Babadook is rated so high while Housebound is relatively unknown. But to a movie junkie like me, Housebound is way much better than Babadook, in everything.",/review/rw8448604/?ref_=tt_urv
