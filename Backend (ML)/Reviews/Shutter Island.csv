7 January 2022,andrewchristianjr,7," DISAPPOINTING FINALE.
","The acting is phenomenal, especially from Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley, and it does an excellent job of getting the audience to understand the stress of parenthood. However, the film tried to build up so much tension that never reached its breaking point. Rather, it fizzles out in a very disappointing finale.",/review/rw7729979/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2022,drednm,," Annoyingly Vague with Lousy Ending
","This is a long and confusing story about an academic (Olivia Colman) on vacation in Greece whose idyll is interrupted by a loud and sinister family from New York City. One of the women has a small child and it causes Colman to have a series of flashbacks to when she had small daughters who smothered her while she was a doctoral candidate (or a young professor, hard to tell).",/review/rw7729979/?ref_=tt_urv

","College professor Leda Caruso (Olivia Colman) is vacationing in a sparse Greek resort. A large noisy family invades her peace. She has a confrontation with Nina (Dakota Johnson), a young mother in the group. When Nina loses her girl, Leda manages to find her. They start an uneasy friendship. In flashbacks, a twentysomething Leda (Jessie Buckley) has a troubled relationship with her two daughters.",/review/rw7729979/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,zkonedog,4," Flashbacks Were All That Compelled Me (And That's Not A Great Formula)
","The storytelling apparatus for ""The Lost Daughter"" is actually pretty simple: a present-day timeline is set up, and then supplemented by flashbacks that flesh out the backstory of the main character. In this specific case, however, I only found myself compelled by the flashbacks, and almost nothing happening in the main timeline. That's not a great formula for film success.",/review/rw7729979/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2021,ferguson-6,8," past and present collide on an island
","Greetings again from the darkness. There are so many things that go unspoken about parenting, and first time writer-director Maggie Gyllenhaal specifically focuses her lens on the pressures of motherhood, by adapting the 2006 novel from the anonymous and talented and mysterious Italian writer Elena Ferrante. Of course, we are all aware of Ms. Gyllenhaal's fine work as an actor, yet it's almost beyond belief that this is her debut as a feature film director. The source material is strong, but Ms. Gyllenhaal, along with a terrific performance from Olivia Colman (Oscar winner, THE FAVOURITE, 2018), turn a coastline vacation into a mesmerizing psychological case study.",/review/rw7729979/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2022,classicsoncall,7," ""We are obliged to do so many stupid things.""
","I think there are many nuances one can ascribe to the title of the picture, because after all, every female is someone's daughter, whether acknowledged or not. For a small length of time, a young girl at the beach actually does get lost for a while, but in her calm, assured manner, Leda Caruso (Olivia Colman) locates the child, and returns her to an anxious extended family. But even prior to that event, Leda took an interest in the girl's mother (Dakota Johnson), while drawing comparisons to her own life and the way things turned out for her as a forty eight year old professor of comparative literature. It almost looks as if Leda wants to warn Nina (Johnson) not to make the same mistakes she did in raising her own daughters, which she abandoned for a time due to her own selfishness. A telling moment in Leda's past concerned a flashback in which her older daughter cut a finger as a child, and Leda quite pointedly refused to kiss the crying girl's cut, even though she begged her mother numerous times. That struck me as going out of her way to neglect the child's immediate need for recognition, later highlighted in another flashback during Leda's affair with Professor Hardy (Peter Sarsgaard), who quoted French philosopher Simone Weil - ""Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity"".",/review/rw7729979/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2022,kosmasp,9," Left out cold
",Maggie Gyllenhall - an actress who as many before her now went behind the camera. Her directorial debut is quite the heavyweight and a movie that will divide those who watch it. On so many levels this was not an easy one to take on and I think she chose this project because of this and not despite of it.,/review/rw7729979/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2022,tkdlifemagazine,5," Stong Performances Are Not Enough To Salvage This One
","It is hard to stop watching this movie but I am not sure I can say I liked it. It caught my attention because of the stellar critic reviews and the setting, Greece. The film is well done. It is well acted. Olivia Colman, Dakota Johnson, and Ed Harris, among others are very engaging was the story of a deeply troubled woman on summer holiday in Greece unfolds. This is not a big, over the top movie, but it is not simple. Colman, is by definition, an unreliable narrator. While we learn a lot about her past and her troubles we have great difficultly understanding what is truth and what is illusion-I think the line is blurred. We also have a great difficulty understanding why Colman is the way she is, and maybe that isn't relevant to the story; however, I felt myself desiring to know more about what she was feeling and thinking. Perhaps reading the source material would enlighten me. Perhaps it would not. Regardless, the movie's performances and direction moved me but, in the end, I felt unsatisfied.",/review/rw7729979/?ref_=tt_urv

","Flashbacks of coping as a young mother and infidelity, present moments of dullness on a beach in Greece, two little girls being brats on screen and a stupid doll. This film was long, drawn out and boring as hell. Nothing but a cup of sleepytime tea and quite possibly another remedy for insomnia.",/review/rw7729979/?ref_=tt_urv

",This movie almost put me to sleep. If it wasn't for the little kids crying every 10 minutes it definitely would of knocked me out. I don't understand why people love this film. I thought it was extremely boring. I ended up turning it off half way through. And why are so many people praising Olivia Colman's performance? She pretty much just mopes around awkwardly staring at people. What's so brilliant about that. 4 stars.,/review/rw7729979/?ref_=tt_urv

",...you enjoy characters constantly giving each other odd looks and annoying super closeup shots. Definitely didn't make me want to run out and see Maggie Gyllenhaal's next project. 5 stars for some of the performances. 1 star for the story.,/review/rw7729979/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2022,Calicodreamin,5," Snoozy artisan film

3 January 2022,jkt2006,4," Confused script, award wannabe, terrible ending
","This movie's trailer is something the makers should learn from. It was enticing, sharp and forced me to watch this movie! The movie is exactly the opposite. After a long and slow build up of the main character in present and past(most of the past is repetitive, in circles), the movie goes nowhere and with a horrible ending, I mean seriously! It is a pretentious movie that is definitely vying for an award from frame 1. Is Olivia Colman the actor bad, nope she is awesome in playing the character she does! It is the script that totally feels confused in building up the past and then tries to connect with the present in a broken way which just does not gel or connect well with the viewer. And then the shocking ending, totally felt like the script writer wanted you to feel the melancholy in her life no matter what(well, such endings are typically award winning you see..) Total waste of my two hours on a precious Sunday evening. Not recommended at all!",/review/rw7729979/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2022,paulcreeden,3," Worse than boring..
","This was the first Olivia Coleman vehicle I have disliked. Really. An homage to a severely narcissistic woman. Do we need more of this sort of thing? Without getting into the limited plot, I will say that wasting Ms. Coleman and Ed Harris on this production was a shame. Ms. Gyllenhaal. Has stayed far from her wondrous Netflix production, The Deuce. Perhaps this film reflects one of the great flaws of modern feminism: The elevation of insanity and selfishness to normalcy, tinted with pathos. Perhaps it was simply too mundane a story for the big screen.",/review/rw7729979/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2022,bangel3322,5," Doesn't really go anywhere.....
","While I have to highly rate Olivia Colman's performance in this film...it seemed a wasted effort because the film just lacked an actual story. What was the point of this film? I felt like we needed to delve further into Leda's background because we saw that she gave up her children for some time because she felt suffocated, but, we can see that now in the present ..the way she talks about them, she regrets that and she loves them deeply, so I just wasn't sure what the film was trying to say. I'm guessing the title is referring to her and it's not literal. As I thought maybe little Elena was going to be the one missing and maybe Leda had taken her, or a missing child stirred up memories for her and maybe her child had gone missing in the past. I just kept waiting for something to happen and it never really did. And her occurances in the forest...what were those about? As long as the film was, it felt unfinished.",/review/rw7729979/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2022,cliew5473-107-917925,," It builds up the intrigue and then completely disappoints
","When this film ended, I was left wondering what it was exactly that I just watched and felt like I was trying to find a deeper meaning within the film that I'm not even sure is really even there. Throughout the entire film, I was waiting for something to happen that would tie certain scenes together to make the story line more cohesive and make more sense and provide some sense of closure in regard to the plot and the actions of the main character. But at the end of the film, there I was... still waiting. There were scenes that were completely irrelevant to the story (for example, the scene with the hikers). I kept waiting for that scene to become relevant later in the film, but it never did. It was just ""filler,"" I guess. As far as the acting goes, it was fine, as was the directing. I think the main failure of this film is the plot in general. Basically, it tries to build up a lot of intrigue (and does a decent job at that) but then in the end, you're still left struggling to find meaning and relevance and make connections that don't exist. And because of that, the film comes off as a bit pretentious due to its failed attempt to explore the main character's complex psychological state but even in that, it barely skims the surface.",/review/rw7729979/?ref_=tt_urv

","Even though the movie was a bit slow, it didn't feel boring at all for me. I kept waiting for something big to happen and even though it didn't, I was still enjoying it the whole time.
