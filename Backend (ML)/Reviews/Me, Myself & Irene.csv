27 November 2003,claudio_carvalho,9," A Great Class of Hygienic and Human Body Functions
","Frank (Bill Murray) is a widow without hygienic and bad alimentary habits. He eats food that felt on the floor without cleaning, he does not wash his hands before eating and he eats only junk food. His daughter keeps unsuccessfully trying to correct his behavior. One day, Frank eats a dirty egg and gets a disease. From this moment on, the human body functions are showed through very funny and educational cartoons. The hero, Osmosis Jones, is a white globule, with Chris Rock's voice. The great Farrely brothers again surprise me. This funny (and sometimes scatological movie) is a great class of hygienic and human body functions. Chris Rock and Laurence Fishburne give a great performance with their voices. Bill Murry has the role of a disgusting character. An excellent and very educational movie, indicated also (or specially) for children. My vote is nine.",/review/rw3309161/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2001,jarossi,8," Very fun and imaginative
","I thought this movie was very good.  The people leaving bad reviews are being too critical.  This movie was meant to be fun.  The way the inside of the body is a city, the white blood cells are the police, fireman, etc., the lymph nodes were the police stations, veins were highways, the stomach was a bus station/airport type place, and the germs and bacteria were, of course, the criminals, and so on.  This movie gives a very imaginative way the body works to fight infection, as if the body was a city of people just like in the real world.  You may need to have some sort of knowledge about the body to get some of the puns and jokes, maybe not very young kids will get it, but they will like the animation...this movie is even good for adults.  I give the movie 8/10...I thought it was a very entertaining movie!!!!!",/review/rw3309161/?ref_=tt_urv

15 August 2001,Quinoa1984,6," Clever, with numerous sight gags
","Osmosis Jones is a comedy of human proportions, I guess.  It works enough and when it works well it's a good movie.  Although when you think about it the plot-line inside Frank's body (frank is played by Bill Murray with no shame in great form) is rather routine and for me was the only thing keeping this from being really good.",/review/rw3309161/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2002,wuzupn_tb,8," The stand-out comedy of 2001- someone has a big imagination
","Whoever made this has a big imagination about what goes on inside the human body.  It's very witty and smart.  The whole rookie cop cliche who messes up and is THIS close to being pulled off the force and has a hunch a teams up with an unlikely buddy and ends up being right (for example, Rush Hour) is being given a whole new twist.  The Farrley Brothers have done it again- and made a solid B+ stand out comedy. B+, 8/10",/review/rw3309161/?ref_=tt_urv

22 August 2002,Foz-2,10," As a bio teacher, this was exCELLent.
","Granted, not the funniest movie ever by typical ""guffaw standards"", but certainly one of the most clever. The intelligence behind the humor is evident (unlike another Farrelly movie, Dumb and Dumber) and is also entertaining for kids. ",/review/rw3309161/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2013,SnoopyStyle,6," animation good, but live action gross and boring
","The Farrelly brothers are dipping into the animation pool. It's colorful and primitive animation. It's pretty good, but that's not really the problem. Surprisingly the problem is Bill Murray and live action stuff.",/review/rw3309161/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2018,Animany94,6," A mixed bag.

20 May 2017,leannawkariuki,10," Entertaining and Educational
","This Movie was just incredible because it helps children understand the body and your health in a fun way. The live action combined with the animation was very creative and a great way to watch the movie. I know the movie was really successful but if you ever come across with it, you should definitely watch it.",/review/rw3309161/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2005,MovieAddict2016,5," Good premise, but it wears thin fast
","This was an odd directorial choice for the Farrelly Brothers (""Dumb and Dumber,"" ""There's Something About Mary""). It's an animated film (in parts) about the internal workings of a man's body.",/review/rw3309161/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2002,LebowskiT1000,8," Very clever and some good laughs.
","I wouldn't say this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, but there is definitely some original comedy here.  I thought it was a very inventive story, and quite interesting.  What shocked me more than anything about this film is the fact that it was directed by the Farrelly brothers, who also directed ""Kingpin"", ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""There's Something About Mary"", ""Me, Myself and Irene"", and ""Shallow Hal"".  So this doesn't really fit their profile, but I'm glad to see that they are trying something new.",/review/rw3309161/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,xanderblue-12178,9," A really funny movie next to Tom and jerry 2021
","One of the best movies to come out of animation. And the best part, it's teaches us how our insides work. It's pretty cool and teachable. And thankfully this movie isn't like one of the franchise pictures movies and one of the Tom green movies.",/review/rw3309161/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2021,amandanassif,10," We need more of this!!!
",I'm 29. I was able to enjoy the VHS era thoroughly with Disney and new to the scene Pixar movies like toy story. However. Osmosis Jones blows a ton of Disney films away. There is something about Osmosis that captivated me then And still does now. I am leaving this review because I am currently watching it on HBO max. Love the idea of the educational value the hidden adult humor and I always cry never fails. Last thing! I've always been so intrigued with cartoon world meeting real life and this does that so well!,/review/rw3309161/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2010,TheLittleSongbird,8," Clever, original and entertaining
","Osmosis Jones isn't the funniest movie I have ever seen, but it is very clever and has an original concept. The humour is crude I agree, but it is actually amusing- the script does have its witty and amusing parts. The animation is not too bad either, certainly a unique style of animation, the backgrounds are nice and the characters have interesting features. And the music is very good as well. As I've said already, the concept is very original and the equally original and well written story(even with one or two predictable parts) does justice to that concept. Also, I liked the characters, Ozzy and Drix are likable and what they get up to is intriguing, fun and often unpredictable, Thrax is a great villain and the voice acting from Chris Rock, Laurence Fishburne, David Hyde Pierce, William Shatner and Bill Murray is top notch. Overall, clever, original and entertaining. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw3309161/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2019,UniqueParticle,10," Underrated treasure
",I love this movie so much! I'm one of very few that is proud to give this a 10 mainly cause it makes me happy & I'm hugely into science! Despite its flaws of ridiculousness in some bits it's a sheer blast in my opinion; Bill Murray and Chris Rock were a delight. Aside from that the Farrelly brothers are great directors.,/review/rw3309161/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2003,Methodless_Man,6," What happens when a kid is taught biology too early
","This movie was not all that bad, however it appeals to kids who wouldn't really understand what's going on. They'd just see cartoon characters fighting, and be entertained and the whole knowledge of the body would almost have no effect on the kids.",/review/rw3309161/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2002,moviewiz-4,8," Like this one

5 June 2013,videodave,9," A Rare Germ... err .. Gem
","This is one of those rare gems that gets better and better with each viewing. There are so many in-jokes and subtleties packed into it, that it is impossible to get them all with just one viewing. Each repeat viewing evokes a new and unexpected chuckle or grin. Best viewed on DVD so you can pause and review what you just thought you saw. (Does that sentence make sense?) Although the Live Action parts are rough around the edges. Bill Murray is genius, as always, and the animation scenes are obviously a work of love. ",/review/rw3309161/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2004,thumps80631,," God help me, I really liked this film.
","As an aesthete, this movie goes against everything I stand for, but I found it nonetheless very entertaining. It was like a peculiar yet satisfying mix between the Incredible Journey, Toy Story, and Lethal Weapon or Rush Hour (the whole loose-cannon, loner cop with a new partner bit).",/review/rw3309161/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2021,MatthewLong23,8," Cartoon portion better then live action parts
",This is a clever movie about a virus and how the body fights through the eyes of a white blood cell named Osmosis Jones who fights against illnesses. Bill Murray plays the human and isn't very funny as a guy who doe'nst take care of himself and gets a virus after eating an egg that was in the mouth of a monkey. In the age of COVID-19 this movie is interesting in how the body fights off a virus with the use of characters being the cells of the body trying to make the body work. Animation part good live action bad.,/review/rw3309161/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2015,anaconda-40658,7," Bill's Dentist Appointment.
","Osmosis Jones (2001): Dir (live): Bobby Farrelly, Peter Farrelly / Dir (animated scenes): Piet Kroon, Tom Sito / Cast: Bill Murray, Molly Shannon, Chris Elliott, Elena Franklin / Voices: Chris Rock: Creative and unique animation. Bill Murray plays an out of shape father who is constantly warned by his daughter to watch his eating habits. Soon a deadly virus begins to spread throughout his body. It is up to animated blood cell Osmosis Jones and his partner Drix to destroy evil virus Thrax. Live footage is directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly who are famous for great comedies such as Kingpin and There's Something About Mary. Animated sequences are directed by Piet Kroon and Tom Sito who are given the best part of the film. Animated characters are cool and carry the film but the live performances are flat. Bill Murray holds his own as this unhealthy eater who ends up in the down and out and must rely on Jones to triumph and recreate his health. Molly Shannon has the misfortune of having a zit explode on her face. Chris Elliott has a cardboard role of Murray's brother and co-worker. Elena Franklin is flat as Murray's daughter who cares for her father and his welfare. The voice talents fare much better with Chris Rock leading the way as the free spirited Osmosis Jones whose mission is to render Bill Murray healthy. Creative and well meaning comedy about responsible living. Score: 7 / 10",/review/rw3309161/?ref_=tt_urv
