6 October 2010,mjk280,10," Possibly my favorite drama ever
","I hate giving 10's because nothing is perfect, but a 9 doesn't do it justice. There have been a lot of 9's over the years but this show is even better than those. ",/review/rw2097039/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," As good as everyone says it is!
","What can I say about The Shield that hasn't already been said? It was absolutely brilliant! It was so far ahead of its time when it came out from 2002-2006 and has been copied many times since. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special. It follows a rogue cop in the Los Angeles police department named Vic Makey (Michael Chilkis), who leads a criminal division task force that will do anything possible and go to any lengths to take down the criminals they're chasing, including breaking the law or working with other criminals. The Shield is one of the best to ever do it. It's one of the most compelling police dramas to ever be on television.",/review/rw2097039/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2020,danielcereto,10," The Shield on 2020
","I just finished this series today on July 2020 and all I have to say is that it does not look cheap, old or non interesting, just keeping in mind this was filmed between 2002-2008.
First, most of the main cast are extremely good actors. Vic, Aceveda and Shane were the most powerful.
Second, the storyline and the length of the chapters are quite good too. Probably the story could have been told with 4-5 seasons easily. But it is what it is.
Last, camera work, make up and sound are pretty cool. I can't believe this show started on 2002.
On the other hand, seems some characters were not fully developed or look like the writers didn't want to give them credit. But not a big thing.
So, overall if you're looking for an excellent cops show, brutal, raw and almost perfect, this one is for you. Now, I'm going to watch The Wire. I want to compare both shows and see which one is better.",/review/rw2097039/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2020,Supermanfan-13,9," Among the best cop shows ever created!
",The Shield is absolutely deserving of its hype and still holds up as much today as it did when it was on over 12 years ago! There are sooo many good police shows out there to choose from but The Shield is among the best to ever do it. It will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire series!,/review/rw2097039/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2022,travola-35109,10," Top 10 all time show.
",The Shield is incredible and a trailblazer for modern tv drama. It's the greatest cop show ever made and had to be considered a top 10 cable television drama of all time. There are twists and turns and betrayal like never seen before when it came out. The characters are deep and well written. The story arch for the main characters is incredible and everything that happens in the series whether it's season one of the final season matters and is relevant to the show.,/review/rw2097039/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2012,Eumenides_0,10," The Perfect TV Show?
","I haven't watched many TV shows ever since The Shield ended, and never again with the same devotion and lack of critical attitude. After The Shield, I just couldn't go back to watching problem-of-the-week type of shows, whether it be super-duper, morally perfect policemen solving a crime every episode (CSI, Criminal Minds, The Mentalist, et cetera), or some young reluctant hero killing monsters (Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Supernatural, et cetera). I became used to long-term plotting, dynamic characters constantly changing, complex narratives developing organically, and incisive critiques of society, race, sexuality, power, politics, family relationships, and more, much more. Yes, I even became used to bleakness, a lot of pessimism and a refusal to offer viewers simple solutions to complex problems. In this sense, The Shield is less a conventional TV show and more a novel in visual form, a long story, carefully plotted, full of meditations and insights into human nature, and a mirror to our times.",/review/rw2097039/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2022,collectorofsorts,10," Probably the best Series of its type!
","I watched this during the original TV broadcasts and purchased the DVD set afterwards. It's probably the best police corruption series that I've ever watched. It takes us from the early years when they started taking shortcuts to the later years when they had become full fledged criminals who thought nothing of flooding the streets with drugs or killing people. The thing I really enjoyed about the series was that it showed them as human beings. By the end of the series, their morals had become so twisted that they were going after people just like themselves and somehow justifying it to themselves. It was a great series and I still get the DVD set out yearly for a watch. I just finished watching the final episode and it's just as good as it was the first time I watched it. And the series is probably even more relevant today than it was back then. It tells us that power is a corrupter and too much power can become a great corrupter. I think we've all personally seen that to be true. I know I have in the people I've encountered throughout life. If you haven't watched it yet. Then stream it or buy the DVD/Blu-ray set. You won't regret it!",/review/rw2097039/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2009,SkyFox1,10," The best series ever written
","The Shield is not for everyone. My wife, for instance does not like violent TV shows. The Shield is raw, violent and full of incredible suspense and intrigue. A good friend of mine recently turned me on to the Shield and I will forever be grateful. I travel quite a lot and watched all 100+ hours of the Shield while on the road. I could not wait to get to the next episode. During a recent 2 week trip to India, I did not turn on the TV one time. I watched a episode or two of The Shield every night and a whole season each way on the plane. There is a lot of debate about the ending, which I thought was perfect. It's difficult to end such an epic saga but these guys did it about as good as you can. The Shield is life changing. Not all for the good.You should be prepared to be affected by this thing. It's gritty but in the same way that A Clockwork Orange is gritty. The difference is that this lasts for a long, delicious time.",/review/rw2097039/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2020,jackDee-56565,10," A gritty and dark masterpiece police drama
","This series is pretty damn intense and a true classic, it does not hold back on anything, its quite realistic in terms of its brutal violence and follows some disturbing cases which may be too much for some people, I love this show all the cast are amazing, its very well written every episode is exiciting, I think more crime shows should learn from this",/review/rw2097039/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2012,da_gopsta,9," One of a kind - a TV Series that actually gets better as it progresses
","I only heard of The Shield a few weeks ago. I had only just finished watching a previous TV show from start to finish, and was after a new one to pass the time. I typed in ""The Best TV Shows Ever"", or something similar, on Google, and I noticed that this was on a few lists. I'd never heard of it, but after checking to see that it was given a very respectable 8.7 rating on IMDb, I decided to check it out.",/review/rw2097039/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2022,GoodTVwatcher,10," Watched it last year still think about it sometimes
","I'm not movie series buff but do watch occasionally.. Why did the American industry stopped making such shows/movies. This was just next level, the level of engagement, so tight screenplay, the complexity of characters, their dislogues, acting of all the top cast.",/review/rw2097039/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,lynxenn,10," Overall THE BEST Show of All Time.
","I watched The Shield when it originally aired. It quickly became my favorite show and no other show has surpassed it 20 years later. It may be a little dated today (a lot of things I see on other shows today I saw first on The Shield) and not quite as shocking as it was back then but it still holds up amazingly well. If you enjoy any type of police show or shows that make you question morality and right vs. Wrong, watch The Shield.",/review/rw2097039/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2009,lokutus-1,9," I thought i'd seen it all

17 March 2010,uncatw6,10," Very very very good show...top 3 series finale ever
","The shield is one of the best cop shows of all time, only behind ""The Wire."" The story line is rich and the cast is just brilliant. Michael Chiklis had a career defining role as the brutal Vic Mackey. Chiklis is so good that somehow you continue to root for the guy after all of the brutal crimes he has committed. He truly played that role to perfection. The show continues to get better as the seasons progress. They build on each other perfectly which sets up the epic and heart-wrenching series finale.

20 May 2010,jfcthejock,10," The Wire Meets Boys In The Hood
","The Shield in my opinion as it is in most people's view, is probably regarded as second to The Wire as one of the greatest shows on television. The Shield is not just a cop show either, just like The Wire. With The Shield, you see politics, family issues, sexuality, and many other hard hitting topics that The Wire covers also but in two separate environments; Baltimore and Los Angeles. I was lucky enough to have bought the entire season 1 - 7 of The Shield on DVD at a good price, and slowly made my way through the vice and darkness that surrounds the show and its characters.",/review/rw2097039/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,Catspaw57,9," As cop series go
","The story lines weave in and out and stretch from one season to the next, always leaving a little tension.... The characters are more real in their foibles than one usually expects from television fare, and this is probably what makes the series watchable over a long period. The viewer lives along with them, the ups, the downs, the quirkiness (Dutchboy is a little too quirky)... And the acting and language is by and large excellent. Hand-held cameras make the whole thing immediate.",/review/rw2097039/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2020,drunken_munki,10," The best cop show written and filmed to date.
","Often you will hear people praise 'The Wire', another cop show aired at the same time as 'The Shield'; in my opinion this is the better show for several reasons. I still would recommend 'The Wire', but 'The Shield' offers more content with an excellent story that follows Vic and his corrupt line-crossing strike team.",/review/rw2097039/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2020,axelpuri-1,10," Nothing like it
","I know im late to the party but i just wanted to add my two cents. I have seen a lot of shows in my life from the Wire , breaking bad , sons of anarchy , downtown abbey to GOT and everything in between ( of-course not but definitely all the ones worth watching ) but The Shield has a special place in my heart. First it saw me through the corona virus lockdown and had me baited hook line and sinker like i have never been . I almost cried when it ended because i didn't want it to but also had me enthralled to the point that i couldn't wait to see what the next episode would bring .",/review/rw2097039/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2005,Antagonisten,9," Amazing
","I began watching ""The Shield"" mostly because of a coincidence. The Swedish movie channel ""Canal+"" usually rerun their shows 2-3 episodes at a time on Sundays. And it was one of those times, a Sunday with heavy snowfall and nothing to do, that i sat down and watched three episodes in a row. And instantly i was hooked.",/review/rw2097039/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2022,tindfoting,9," The devil you need
","It's been awhile, but if I recall correct, Vic and his squad killed of a part of the squad in the pilot episode. Which shows what these guys is bout. Vic Mackey is the bulldog, the guy you don't want on your bad side. And for 7 seasons we see his squad breaking every rule in the book, and at the same time you feel strangly attached to these assholes. These corrupted policemen gets the job done. Elegal or not. You both hate and love Vic. And the show kinda created a star of the biggest slimeball, Walton Goggins, who looks pure redneck. So much that Tarantino has made Goggins one of his loyal actors. A great, gritty cop series with a very satisfying end.",/review/rw2097039/?ref_=tt_urv
