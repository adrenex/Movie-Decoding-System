6 August 2016,ComedyFan2010,8," The classic of the teen soaps
","I did not watch much of the show when it was originally on TV. Now, about 25 years after it started I decided to watch something that ""is 90's"" and BH 90210 was the show that right away got into my head.",/review/rw7435131/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2003,epiphany-5,," Love It Or Hate It - It's A TV Institution. . .
","It's easy to forget (or not even know) that at one point, Beverly Hills, 90210 (created by Darren Star who'd go on to Melrose Place before the phenomenon that is 'Sex & The City') was the biggest teen-orientated show in the world. Yes - the world! One minute, it was struggling to survive and the next, the stars of the series inspired scenes reminiscent of 'Beatlemania'. And justly so because in those halcyon days of yesteryear, 90210's blend of drama, cheese, humour, pure unadulterated escapism, great scenery in terms of cast and location and strong characterisation was compelling viewing.",/review/rw7435131/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2006,Bob-45,," Three! Three!! Three Shows in One!!!
","While ""Beverly Hills 90210"" was making its ten year run, I never watched a single episode. The affairs of rich kids in Beverly Hills really didn't interest me; and, even though Jennie Garth and Tiffani Amber-Thiessan are real eye candy, that wasn't enough to tie me to watching a weekly continuing drama with what I thought would be such an uninteresting subject. However, when the Soap Opera Channel offered the show in sequence five days a week and my wife encouraged me to watch it with her, I reluctantly agreed. I'm glad I did, because ""Beverly Hills 90210"" is, in my opinion, the best written and produced continuing drama in TV history. Why do I say this? Because ""Beverly Hills 90210"" survived two radical format changes and remained consistently watchable for its entire 10 year run. Actually, ""Beverly Hills 90210"" is three different shows: an excellent ""high school teenagers in love"" show; a very good ""college kids antics"" show and a good ""Yuppies in love"" show. The creative talent managed to produce three above average shows with an amazing consistency of story lines and talent, using mostly the original cast. Nobody else has ever done this, at least to my knowledge. The producers are to be commended for keeping the cast remarkable intact, even down to the minor characters. To the best of my knowledge, only one character was played by two different actresses, that being Andrea Zuckerman's grandmother. Compare that to the more prestigious soaps, ""Dynasty"" and ""Dallas."" On ""Dallas"" alone, two actors played Gary Ewing, Digger Barnes, Miss Ellie and Kristen Shepherd (who shot J.R.), and three actors played Jenna Wade, and all of these characters were more important to the show's plotting than Andrea's grandmother.",/review/rw7435131/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2019,author-49568,7," Seasons 1-5 Amazing, Seasons 6-10 Meh
","I admit I haven't watched this show for years, so am going on memory here. I watched every episode of Seasons 1-5. When the quality took a nosedive after Season 4 (but Andrea was still around) I started watched it less and less. From what I gathered the plotlines just got more and more ridiculous. The new main actors were all plain like vanilla, like Vincent Young, Jamie Walters, Lindsay Price, Vanessa Marcil, etc. None of the new replacements excited me at all. (Daniel Cosgrove was not bad).",/review/rw7435131/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2001,Brian-272,," New wave prime time soap of the 90's that was a major hit.
","This series aimed at teenagers and young adults was a major hit during the 90's. Leading the pack was the turmoil-ridden saga of rich kids at West Beverly Hills High School who all faced the common problems of love, pregnancies, drugs and family crises subjects that are somewhat more common to youth and young adults. The best stories centered on the Walsh family, newly arrived in town, in particular fraternal twins Brandon (Jason Priestly) and Brenda (Shannen Doherty). The gang then included friends Kelly (Jennie Garth), Steve (Ian Ziering), Andrea (Gabrielle Carteris), Donna (Tori Spelling), David (Brian Austin Green) and moody Dylan (Luke Perry). Later other characters came on like Tiffani-Amber Thiessen while others had left. In the final season of the show most of the original cast had left the cast saw many changes during the ten year run. Most of the stars became major celebrities due to the success of the show.",/review/rw7435131/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2006,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,10," An absolute FOX classic!
","""BEVERLY HILLS, 90210,"" in my opinion, is an absolute FOX classic! I don't think I've seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. It would probably have to be the one where Brenda (Shannen Doherty) has a fight with Kelly (Jennie Garth). However, I think it was always sad when friends fought. I always wanted to cry at that. It would have been nice if all the main characters stayed with the show throughout its entire run. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope some network brings it back on the air for fans of the show to see.",/review/rw7435131/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2019,Bored_Dragon,8," Guilty pleasure
","Several years ago, in 2016 I think, I was grabbed by some nostalgia and I started to rewatch ""Beverly Hills, 90210"". Of course, after three seasons it began to bore me and I moved on to something smarter. Since this month I was in total business and private chaos and I had neither the time nor the concentration to devote more seriously to films, I returned to it again. After the fourth season, I must admit it feels good. When you work from morning to night, seven days a week, this is the right choice to relax before going to bed. I think I'll definitely see it through all ten seasons. Maybe it has no value in an artistic and cinematographic sense, nor in terms of philosophical depth, but it has emotional and nostalgic value for us who grew up in the '90s and it is great for letting the brain out to pasture. And to be honest, it is very well made. Perhaps the stories are Utopian and with fairytale happy-endings, but they also make sense and point. The acting is quite solid and technically there are hardly any flaws. In this genre, only ""Heartbreak High"" beats it.",/review/rw7435131/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2014,taylorkingston,7," Beverly Hills 90210 is a great show...
","This show is actually so great. It's so fun when I watch this show, considering it started seven years before I was born. I can't believe it started twenty-four years ago. Wow. I mainly started watching this show when I found out that Shannen Doherty was in it, because I watched Charmed and loved her from that. When her character, Brenda, left the show, I was sad. But I realized that the show didn't need that character to be great. It did that all on it's own. It's truly a great watch. Anyone with good taste will enjoy this show. Seeing the rich and famous live in the nineties, on the streets of Beverly Hills, is truly enjoyable.",/review/rw7435131/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2007,lucky_star_1,5," Loved this show, but the ending wasn't satisfying
","Beverly Hills 90210 was one of those shows you look back on knowing it defined its era. Along with shows like Saved by the Bell and Dawson's Creek, 90210 was one of THE 90s shows. It had an amazing ensemble cast, the music was great, it was generally fun to watch.",/review/rw7435131/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2004,SonicStuart,10," Great show of the 1990's!
","Beverly Hills 90210 is one of the best drama shows of the 1990's! Especially since this show aired on FOX were most of the good drama shows air. This series is about the lives of a group of high school students living in wealthy Beverly Hills neighborhood, then in the later seasons of the show they move on to their college days as they got older. The kids become friends and enemies, fall in and out of love, and go through an endless series of crises as this small group somehow becomes personally involved in every newsworthy social issue from alcoholism to South African apartheid to pregnancy to AIDS. Jason Priestley was one of the coolest actors on this show and so was Ian Ziering! The best actresses on this show were Tiffani Amber Thiessen and Kathleen Robertson. Tiffani Amber Thiessen was also on another FOX series called Fastlane and Jason Priestley is currently on another good FOX series Tru Calling! I can not believe that this series went all the way through the 1990's! I can't wait until they start putting this show out on DVD!",/review/rw7435131/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2003,Sargebri,," Downhill After Junior Year
","When the show first premiered it, surprisingly, had a lot of depth.  It dealt with the problems that most teenagers go through as they are going through high school (sex, drugs, racism, death and AIDS).  The only thing that was different about it was the fact that it was set in upscale Beverly Hills.  However, when the scene shifted to college, it became more of a soap opera along the lines of its distant cousin Melrose Place.  I would rather look at the episodes from the first two seasons when the stories were all done in one episode than look at the garbage it eventually became.",/review/rw7435131/?ref_=tt_urv

26 September 2006,denis888,8," A very good serial
","I remember seeing this serial in my home country, Russia, somewhere around 1996 or 1997. That was quite a sensation. A real American show, and about real American young people, like me or my pals. And what was the best thing in all that was that all those problems and joys that they had in their sunny California were very close and clear for us in colder Russia. We, men, soon fell in love with beautiful girls of the serial - Jenny Garth, Kathleen Robertson (who was especially cool as Claire Arnold, the rascally sweet daughter of President Arnold), Tori Spelling or any other lady in there. Girls went slightly mad (Do not bite me for this, I am just being kiddingly nostalgic!) with Luke Perry, Brian Austin Green or endearingly correct and always clean Jason Priestly. Well, all that the main characters had in the film was so clear and understandable for us - love, hate, school, money, family troubles, cowardice and friendship - no boundaries exist for such things. We followed each episode so closely and so attentively. Of course, the BH 90210 is not devoid of weaknesses - some roles are pretty shallow and some moments are way too sentimental. It seemed that each of the main heroes had to overcome all the possible and impossible hardships and ordeals in this life - drugs, sects, deaths, losses. Sometimes, it was too too much. Anyway, the serial still stands out well and still looks fresh and dear, which is a big asset of the film.",/review/rw7435131/?ref_=tt_urv

","The original series premiered when I was only 5 years old. So, of course I wasn't allowed to watch it at the time, but I remember it being a major force in the pop culture stratosphere. EVERYONE was talking about this show. Even tho I had never seen a single episode as a child...I begged my parents for any piece of merchandise that happened to fall into my field of vision. I had the special addition Brenda trading card from the Honey Nut Cheerios cereal box. I had the 'Donna' Barbie doll. I had the official 90210 picture book that I got for free at my school book fair.

20 August 2000,Mancini2000,," For 10 Years, they were MY family.
","This is the show that helped me get through the 90's! From sophomores  in high school to college graduates, I was hooked to the entire gang. I  will never forget Brandon, Kelly, Steve, Donna, Dylan, Valerie, David,  Brenda, Noah, or Clare.   In 1990, Aaron Spelling (Dynasty, Love Boat, Charlie's Angels)  unleashed the FOX teen drama Beverly Hills 90210, a show based on the  lives of the rich, snobbish high school students of Beverly Hills. Who  would have known the show would last 10 years? New to California,  siblings Brandon and Brenda made friends with the students of West  Beverly High. Through high school, David witnessed best buddy Scott  accidentally shoot himself, Donna kept her virginity, Brandon and  Andrea became great friends, Steve was the sexed up prankster, and  Brenda found out Dylan and Kelly were together when she was in Paris.  After graduating West Beverly, the gang moved onto college. Donna got  involved with abusive musician Ray, Brandon and Kelly dated, Brenda  moved away, Dylan got married only to have his bride shot and killed by  his rival, bitchy Valerie moved into the Walsh house and made enemies  with Kelly, Kelly's druggie boyfriend Colin got arrested, and many of  the gang had already had addictions (Dylan, Kelly, David, Valerie,  Colin). After college, the gang got out into the real world. Brandon  and Kelly nearly married, Dylan returned, Valerie accused Noah of rape,  Steve met and married Janet after getting her pregnant, Donna's sister  Gina moved to Beverly Hills, and in the end, Donna and David got  married.   The memories will never be forgotten.   Kelly getting shot at LAX, Donna loosing her virginity to David on  graduation night, Dylan's father ""killed"" in a car explosion, Kelly  caught in a fire at Steve's rave, Brenda/Dylan/Kelly/, Valerie and  Kelly rivalry, Andrea sleeping with married man, Gina slapping Kelly,  and David and Donna's series finale wedding.

","This is one of the best shows you will ever see !! I remember the first episode, all of the characters being sophomores in high school, just starting to gain some identity . To me, each character is a fantastic representation of the different situation a teenager faces in life. You've got the girls Kelly , Brenda, Donna (the good girl) , and Andrea (pronounced ON-dreea), and the guys Brandon (won my vote for best looking!) Steve, nerdy David, and soon to follow cool hand Luke - Dylan . The gang is as close as a bunch of high-schoolers are going to get, but let me tell you why to watch . This show crosses everything - drugs, sex , abuse, you name it . The characters bring the topics into their own hands and show how it affects their friends, family and lives. It has actually taught me a few lessons as well . One being that you never know your friends, and don't be surprised by their actions . This show proves that you never really know anyone . 90210 doesn't hold anything back, it shows emotion, and best of all rescues",/review/rw7435131/?ref_=tt_urv

7 June 2019,AdrienneGrayceMusic,10," Of course I'm going to give this icon show a 10
","I mean, I grew up with this show and it was a part of my life for 10 seasons, and I owe this show a 10 rating. I was 10 when the show premiered but still watched avidly. Beverly Hills 90210 addressed basically every area of life in all of their episodes. They had episodes of homophobia, racists, underage sex and pregnancies, death in the family, true love, and the importance of friendship. Their episodes were very informative and I love the writers for addressing the common issues the world faces today. To be honest, I came to dislike Brenda's character. The first seasons were kind of cheesy but things heated up when Tiffani Thiessen joined the cast as Valerie. The show got better, and had more interesting stories. I do think that they overplayed the whole valerie hating kelly thing though. They made them complete enemies. It was very sad when Jason Priestly left the show and then Tiffani a couple episodes later. They brought in the beautiful Vanessa Marcil, (to bring in another bad girl when valerie left the show) as Gina, and she did a good job, but the last 2 seasons were not my favorite. I still enjoyed it though. I watch the reruns often, and even own the dvd set. I could watch this show a million times over and never get sick of it.",/review/rw7435131/?ref_=tt_urv
