5 February 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," My personal favourite of the franchise
","The first Home Alone is very good indeed. The last two are just wannabes and feel like they don't belong. Home Alone 2 is my personal favourite, and I watch it about once a month. The only problem is that the jokes are basically retreads of the first movie, but believe me, they're miles better than the ones in the fourth ( which is one of the worst movies ever) This is still a very solid film, that gets slow in the second half. The performances are excellent. Macaulay Culkin brought a lot of charm to almost all the movies he's been in. Just a shame, he isn't acting any more. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are hilarious, as always. Catherine O'Hara and John heard are amiable as the parents, while the wonderful Tim Curry gives a hilarious performance as the Concierge. My favourite scenes were the bathroom scene in the hotel, and when the staff are held hostage by a television. Just priceless. Eddie Bracken and Brenda Fricker also make appearances, and their scenes are touching, as they are of friendship and acceptance. I absolutely adored the soundtrack too, New York looks splendid and the Plaza Hotel was incredible to look at. Brilliant movie! 9/10. Bethany Cox",/review/rw8728338/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," Yes, same plot, but it still gets the same laughs as the first one did if not more
","Now I'm aware that Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is the exact same plot as the first Home Alone, and not to mention how silly it seems that these folks would leave their kid behind, but come on, this movie was all in good fun. It still has me constantly laughing 'till this day, I think if you loved the first Home Alone, I'm sure that you'll just naturally love this one as well. Not too many folks are just giving it a good chance. I mean, the Wet Bandants are back and they are just as funny as ever! I think this house that Kevin set up was actually in some ways a little more fun than the first because of the traps he was able to set. Not to mention the Plaza Hotel plot was so great and fun to watch.",/review/rw8728338/?ref_=tt_urv

","Too many sequels suffer from Deja Vu, and hardly any of those carbon copies improve upon the original. Home Alone 2 is a carbon copy, but it's also much better and more complex a movie than the first. In another mad rush to the airport the McCallisters make a point of remembering Kevin this time, but he gets lost in a crowd at the airport and follows a man who looks like his dad onto the wrong plane. Thirteen of the McCallisters are going to Miami for Xmas (do they never stay at home?) but Kevin is headed for the Big Apple, and he's going to have that once-in-a-lifetime vacation he's been wishing for.",/review/rw8728338/?ref_=tt_urv

7 December 2005,dee.reid,8," I love it!
","""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" is young Macaulay Culkin's second greatest hour in the series as Kevin McCallister, who has to learn to be a man again on the mean streets of the Big Apple after being separated from his family once more. He checks into a swank Manhattan hotel (where Donald Trump is apparently staying at too). He's pursued again by comic bad guys Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), and director Chris Columbus and screenwriter John Hughes keep the action and laughs coming. Tim Curry also appears as a concierge who has to prove that Kevin is on his own, and Brenda Fricker is the pigeon lady who watches over Kevin's little shoulder. There is another tricks & traps showdown at the end, which keeps the slapstick and comic violence at an all-time high.",/review/rw8728338/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2000,Op_Prime,," Same plot. Same actors. New traps. No problem.
","Home Alone 2 has pretty much the same plot as the first movie, but Home Alone 2 is a very good sequel. The new traps for the Wet, er... Sticky Bandits are great. Once again Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern give wonderful performances. Having Tim Curry in this was also a treat. There is a lot of enjoyment in this movie.",/review/rw8728338/?ref_=tt_urv

",The first 2 home alone films are classics and i watch them ever year like a couple of times each a year since i was a kid and my honest opinion is that the second one is my favourite out of the 2 probably because is based in new york and as i'm not American seeing new york at Christmas is like a dream.,/review/rw8728338/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2008,Jasper76,9," The cuteness ends here
","This should have been the end of the Home Alone series, seeing that the same premise and cast were used for two films but, naturally, Hollywood just can't resist trying to squeeze more money from a proved formula. I'm not one for sequels but this was one of the handful that I can enjoy time and again, not only because the original cast is in it, but because of Macaulay Culkin's comedic ability (even as a kid) and Joe Pesci's and Daniel Stern's reactions to getting their butts kicked, booby trap style. Kevin is not forgotten (like he was last time) but hops the wrong plane after he puts fresh batteries in the family camera right before he gets to the gate at the airport (his family had all the bad luck with high winds knocking out the electric - and the alarm clock - twice). He mistakes a man with the same coat as his father and after Kevin reassures a flight attendant he's on the right plane, takes his seat ... in a plane heading in the exact opposite direction the rest of his family is going (naturally, no one realizes Kevin's missing until they're in Miami and he's in NY). Who could have thought a vacant New York brownstone could be so much fun? Sure, Pesci's and Stern's characters are more banged up this time but, hey, they started it. (The adventures in the Plaza Hotel are hilarious, as well.) Anyway, this is one sequel worth the time to watch. Just don't bother with the irrelevant, contrived, and unncessary third installment of the series.",/review/rw8728338/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2020,brookenichole-98054,10," Another Classic!
","Home Alone 2 is great! It's fun and filled with heart. The scenes with Kevin and the Pigeon Lady are sweet. The thieves and the pranks are amazing as always, and filled with a ton of laughs. And the toy store and hotel scenes are terrific and gorgeous.
One thing that bugged me was the mother. I was really disappointed that the mother didn't learn from the first movie, and that she didn't get mad at Buzz. Kevin honestly didn't do anything wrong except causing a scene.
Overall, it's another must watch every year.",/review/rw8728338/?ref_=tt_urv

","Home Alone 2: Lost in New York was excellent & shot beautifully. It brought back everything that happened in the first film. The same actors portrayed their roles wonderfully.

16 December 2021,reidyq,8," Why are most of the reviews negative? This is almost better than the original
","I love this movie. It is not as good as the first movie but that isn't because it is not funnier, or it in general just isn't as entertaining. It is because it copies the first film way too much. A lot of stuff has a really low chance of happening, just like the original, and without spoiling it I will just say its very similar. Now that we are finished the bad things about this movie, lets get to the good things! This movie is the funniest film out of the Home Alone franchise, and I think most people will probably agree with me on that. Macaulay Culkin did really well, and so did everyone else in the main cast. This movie is almost as good as the original, (which is also 8/10) but I
I wish the story was a bit more original.",/review/rw8728338/?ref_=tt_urv

",It's still my favorite sequel. Kevin being alone in New York City before Christmas. I like the story. I've watched it more than a hundred times. I remember playing the Home Alone 2 video games on SNES and Sega Genesis. Tim Curry is hilarious as Mr. Hector in the Plaza Hotel. This film has a lot of comedy and great laughs. The first film and the sequel are still my favorite and they're the first two films on my favorite entertaining list.,/review/rw8728338/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2007,samcracc,10," the best Christmas movie ever
","I have seen this movie at home. I love this Christmas film. Marv and Harry are funny. I like the part when Mr. Duncan gives Kevin McCallister the turtle doves then gives it to a friend to be friends forever. Whats not funny that Buzz McCallister calls Kevin McCallister a trout snipper. When Kevin McCallister comes out Duncan's Toy Chest store then also Marv and Harry come out Duncan's Toy Chest then Harry say ""So where to next"" then Marv says ""should we go to the Central Park Zoo"" that was hilarouis. Watch this Christmas movie soon when you buy or have it for a present for Christmas then people all around the world for Christmas will love this Christmas movie.",/review/rw8728338/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2014,Filvies144,9," Great movie, my favorite of the franchise
","The first Home Alone was liked by everybody. I liked the first one but this is awesome. I like the adventure in this one, in fact this is better than Home Alone 1. Everybody thinks Home Alone 1 was better than this, but I think this is a little better. The booby traps were even better than the original, like there was one where Marv was electrocuted. I didn't think Home Alone 3 was bad, but Home Alone 4 was a complete disaster. Its strange how this can be called ''Home Alone 2'' even though kevin is not in his own house. A 6.5/10 is underrated, so I think that should be raised a little bit more. At least they had the same criminals as the first one, because 3 had different criminals. That's all I can say, so overall, this movie was a great movie.",/review/rw8728338/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2002,dbdumonteil,," an useless sequel to ""home alone""
","When you watch this film for the first time, you can ask yourself this question ""was it useful to make a sequel to one of the most successful films made in 1990?"". The answer is obviously not. The only interest of the film is commercial. Indeed, John Hughes and Chris Colombus felt like renewing with the huge success of ""Home Alone"". Although this film was average, it was quite funny but, here, its sequel is very poor and disappointing. The film takes back too many elements from the first and as a consequence, it doesn't create surprises any more. For example, when Kevin is at the Plaza Hotel, he's watching, apparently, a detective film, and we know that the man, in the film, will kill the young lady as it was the case in Home Alone with the two men on the video. On the other hand, Kevin's weird neighbour was considered a slayer for a long time; but then Kevin found out that he was an unhappy man. In the film, a tall woman who brings up pigeons took the place of Kevin's neighbour and like this man, she's apparently threatening, but then again, like the man, she had a miserable life. So the film is deprived of originality. Moreover, the screenplay is always predictable and sometimes it's unlikely: Kevin's traps are more dangerous than in the previous film and however the two burglars don't seem to suffer a lot. At last Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci aren't very funny, Stern is even ridiculous and dumb. In 1997, a third sequel was made but with a different actor instead of Macaulay Culkin in the main role. Let's hope, there won't be a fourth.",/review/rw8728338/?ref_=tt_urv
