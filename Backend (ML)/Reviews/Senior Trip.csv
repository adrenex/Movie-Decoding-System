18 March 2019,Sleepin_Dragon,8," What a pick me up this was.
","Every year some British gem pops up in the cinema, destined to be added to my blu ray collection, a film guaranteed to lift the spirits for years to come. This is 2019's feel good film, yes you know the story, and yes you can figure out every possible turn even if you don't, but it's just such a lovely movie.",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2019,muamba_eats_toast,8," A broad smile from start to end
",A feel good comedy that has you smiling from the start to the end. Yes it's probably over sensationalised and certain puns are overused but when a film has you grinning and laughing Inbetween from first minute to last you can look past its imperfections. A thoroughly good watch the only complaint is that it didn't last longer!,/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv

","So much action, drama, CGI... Who needs it?",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2019,davidgee,7," A MARIGOLD-style crowd-pleaser
","If you liked THE GUERNSEY LITERARY AND POTATO PEEL PIE SOCIETY, you'll be inclined to like this; it will help if you're a fan of sea shanties.",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2019,masonsaul,8," Great feel good film
","Fisherman's Friends is a great feel good film that's undoubtedly predictable but also fun, funny and enjoyable with great performances from it's cast and plenty of heart and some surprisingly emotional moments. It's well paced, well filmed and the sea shanties are also great.",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2020,Gordon-11,," Really liked it!
","I did not expect this film to be so good! It really portrays the sense of community, tradition and most of all, love for culture and heritage. I find it really touching. Fantastic!",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2019,sbweightman,7," A good film that's enjoyable and easy to watch, with plenty of fun sea shanties and sailor humour..
","It's a good film that is enjoyable and easy to watch, but it doesn't really do anything to stand out. The characters are likable and story is told well with a good representation of the lives of the fishermen and their journey to fame, but the drama at the end doesn't quite feel right. Predictable, but the sea shanties are fun to listen to and the humour is as you'd expect.",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2021,blanche-2,8," lovely film
","Based on a true story, Fisherman's Friends tells the tale of a music exec from London (Daniel Mays) who winds up in Cornwall. He winds up making stars of a group of singing fishermen. Along the way, the music executive realizes what's important in life.",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2019,Fudge-3,7," Great music with a little drama, comedy and romance
",A group of music executives from London get stranded in a tiny Cornish fishing port when their holiday yacht fails to arrive. While making the most of it they're exposed to a traditional sailor's shanty. One of them gets left behind to sign up the fishermen to a music contract.,/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2019,martimusross,6," Salt of the Sea Meets London Yuppies from Hoxton
","I really enjoyed this movie, based on a true story of a group of Cornish singing fishermen who made it big in the chart against all odds. This quintessentially British themed movie targeted for a largely British audience delivers the goods, it comes from the same genre as Four Weddings and a Funeral or indeed the recent Fighting With my Family.",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2020,nancyldraper,8," Nice light drama
","If your looking for warm, underdog rising, light watch for an evening, this will tick the boxes. If you enjoy tight male harmonies and songs of the sea, this will be a delight. If you're a fan of DOC MARTIN, you will love how Port Isaac becomes Port Hope. I found Daniel Mays a bit of a hard sell for a leading man but Tuppence Middleton would charm the sailors to the rocks (I've been a fan ever since SENSE8). Really enjoyed this on an evening when I didn't need to think and I could just soak in the charm, the music and the view. I give this movie a 8 (very good) out of 10. {Light Drama}",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2019,rbaylis,8," Charming, gentle comedy that is well worth your time
",This is nice gentle comedy that plays out pretty much as you'd expect but that's not to disparage it in any way because it delivers precisely what you'd want it to. The real life personalities on which the story is based will be able to distinguish historical fact from liberties taken for the sake of the narrative of course. The audience knows that happens but that doesn't take anything away from the charm of the film. Had it played out a little less conventionally and a few of the supporting performances been sharper I'd have rated it a 9.,/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2019,james-31978,10," Smile, cry & laugh
","It's one of those films that has it all, a gentle but evenly paced introduction to the characters which gives you a chance to get to know them and all the fruits of the storyline are not obviously laid before you ""the viewer"" as is with alot of such films embarking on similar themes, as to the success of a film for me personally I put them into classes ""one watchers"" & ""add to library"" this definitely falls into the ""I would watch again"" category",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2021,dk777,9," What Shall We Do With The Drunken Sailor
",An excellent film that stands out today with its traditionalism and values that we are all slowly forgetting.,/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2020,eddie_baggins,7," A toe-tapping good time
","Based on a genuinely smile-inducing true story, small-scale British film Fisherman's Friends is the type of sufficiently delivered cinematic offering that knows exactly what it is and sticks to its formula throughout, as you're likely to walk away from a screening tapping your feet and poorly reciting sea shanties long into the night.",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2019,rich_xnp,10," I wanted to move back to Cornwall
","Anyone who knows Cornwall will love it. I loved there for a short time, and this was a wonderful view of my favourite county. Also a great story, well acted and well written.",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2019,sealswheels,8," An Enjoyable Feel Good Movie
","We were looking for a film to watch at the local cinema, read the overview and thought we would give this one a go. It pretty much turned out exactly as we expected - Not a 10 out of 10 film, but a feel good movie that was well worth watching. I wont go into details and risk a spoiler but it is a good mix of drama and comedy. Plenty of laughs, a bit of romance and a nice story that is based on real life events. If you fancy a night out with a movie that's entertaining and an easy watch give Fishermans Friends a go.",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2019,maskedman1066,9," Feel good, humourous, and satisfying
","A great, well cast, humourous feel good movie that sweeps you up in the beautiful setting of coastal Cornwall, highlighting the little things that matter such as friends, family, love and loyalty...based on the true story of Port Issacs well loved Cornish Shanty singing fisherman. All the cast do an amazing job and it is very well written and the humour will keep you chuckling throughout.",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is an AWSOME feel good movie, the music is brilliant also. See it if you have the chance",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2020,Janet1612,10," Great music
","Feel -good, predictable film and I wish there had been more of the music and less filler stories. . We had the predictable tale of boys fram Lonnon (that's a Cornish accent) who the locals make fun of (charming!). The boys come across the Fisherman's Friends sea-shanty singing group, I think every Cornish resort has one? I saw one in Padtstow. The boys are on a stag do and having a break from their music industry jobs (yeah, that's right). Anyway the rest is history.",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2019,neil-476,8," Charm, whimsy, humour
","In Port Isaac, Cornwall, a group of local fishermen get together to sing sea shanties in pubs and on the quayside, to entertain the public and themselves. A group of young men on a stag weekend trick one of their number into auditioning the fishermen.",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2019,michaelktfc,8," Definitely a higher end seven
","I left this film with a smile on my face and a few in-jokes with the friends I went to see it with, and honestly I think I'd recommend anyone going to see it. The film is unusual in the story it tells, sharing the truish tale (how true are any movie ""true stories"" nowadays?) of a sea shantie singing male group, their devotion to their culture and how they ended up singing for more then just Cornwall holiday-makers. It makes you laugh out loud at times and at others find delight in the wacky things they do in Cornwall's society. Really I wish I could have rated it higher, but it unfortunately is at times a bit predictable and without adequate funding for some stronger can be a suspect in that department.",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2019,phil-99030,9," An unexpected delight
","I really didn't want to see this film. My wife and mother in law did. I lost. I went along because Daniel Mays is in it and he is great.
Yes of course, it's a bit corny, and there is the usual love interest and stranger from out of town (fish out of water) conflict, but hey, you know what. This film is great.
It's based on a true story. If it hadn't been, and somebody came up with the story, it would have been dire, because life simply isn't like that. Except every now and again, something unexpected and unusual happens to ordinary people, and who can knock that?
I loved the story, and felt really pleased for the people involved. My wife and MiL hated it. They're wrong. Watch it with someone you like, and a nice drink, and I think you'll enjoy it. Just remember.....It actually happened.",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," Yeah, buoy.
","By its own admission, 'Fisherman's Friends (2019)' is only 'based on a true story' in the loosest of senses, making a point of pointing this out during its credits via an unusually strong disclaimer. Of course, this is absolutely fine - indeed, it's perhaps better to use real-world events more as inspiration for a piece's premise than to claim absolute authenticity while delivering something that, in many cases, couldn't be further from that - but it does make you wonder why many of the issues that typically plague 'true tales' appear here, and why the filmmakers didn't make use of their apparently larger-than-usual dramatic license to 'fix' (or reduce the impact of) some of them. Furthermore, the flick sticks to convention past the point of pure predictability and into the realm of bizarre detriment, as a very late and contrived 'all is lost' moment unnaturally and unnecessarily drags its duration way beyond its seemingly perfect finish-line. It's not as though this totally ruins the thing, but it does feel completely artificial and take the steam out of what was becoming a fairly enjoyable experience. In general, the feature does exactly what you'd expect it to but it does it well enough, for the most part, that you don't really mind. In its second act, it becomes unexpectedly entertaining as its down-to-earth characters and overall upbeat, 'feel-good' nature start to win you over. This is in stark contrast to, as I mentioned, its laboured final act and, even, its rocky start. The ending itself does a decent job of bringing everything back together and putting a smile on your face, but it is severely dampened by what's just preceded it. As a whole, the flick isn't very deep. The core group isn't really rendered all that well because only a select few are given any real character - never-mind an actual name in the credits - and, even then, most of their development is pretty basic. Most of them are more than watchable, though, and their often humorous inter-group dynamics are certainly believable. Pretty much the entire thing is an easy watch; it's never really boring. It's never exactly exciting or emotionally engaging, though. It also doesn't really say anything, other than maybe making a broad statement that people are more important than money. The best thing, honestly, is probably the music, provided by the real Fisherman's Friends. Now, that's got character. 6/10.",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2021,cscott2331,10," OMG!!!! I loved it.
","I just simply loved this. Coming from a long line of legit kilt wearing Scots, like modern day 2021 wear them,and on top of that some were in the navy...this movie feels like home. Their village and their faces just seeming so familiar. Different places and different dialects aside. This movie hits me in my core. It's such an amazing story and all the moving parts just add to the sweetness and of course the town lore. It's a simple movie that will get you all up in your feels. A simple movie that tells such an inspiring story. A simple movie that I needed after the shit*y 2020. Sit back listen to the musics, feel their love for one another, let it wash over you whilst you fall in love with them, their village, and their music. Don't pass it up. It's a dam* good movie!",/review/rw6682104/?ref_=tt_urv
