22 April 2022,tenealesharman,3," So slow
","The acting isn't terrible, but the pace is so so slow it's hard to stay interested. The flashbacks and time frames are really confusing. And the actor who played Conrad I couldn't get on board with. Had they condensed the series I may have had more tolerance for it but I'm going to struggle to get to the end.",/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2022,blange310,6," Confusing timelines
","The flashbacks and the cuts to them ""live"" and together when they are just texting is very confusing. They jump around so much with little indication of where we are in the sequence of events. Acting is okay, I think Elle Fanning portrays Michelle pretty well. Could have been done in less episodes, I'm gonna power through to finish, but it drags a bit.",/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2022,stefstars,3," Long and Dull
","I had to restart episodes for this so many times because each time I would fall asleep mid episode. There was no need for this to be 8 or 9 episodes long. This could've been done after 3 episodes, perhaps could've even just been a documentary. This was a real tragedy that took place. The titular girl, she has some serious psychological issues and unlike others who watched the show, I don't think they try to make her likable in the show - if anything she became worst and worst as the show went on. I'm not sure what went wrong there and why this girl (now woman) is the way she is. One can only hope she's on a healing path and not on the way to wreak more havoc in peoples' lives. The way they depict the deceased, he comes off unlikeable too, sorry to say. Maybe it's the way he was acted out. I know they're showing how a severely depressed teenager with different diagnosed mental illnesses acts, but it just felt unnatural. Like he's trying really hard to come off as that edgy, messed up ""no one can help me"" teenager, and to me that's what made him unlikeable. ChloÃ« Sevigny as the deceased's mom did a great job. She seems natural in her role, prolly one of the only good things in this series, sorry to say.",/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2022,pfpgssx,4," Way too long and slow
","I was really looking forward to this because I remember this story from the news. Needs editing, and a lot of it. This could have been told in half the time. The acting is decent. One big pet peeve: expecting the audience to read numerous texts from a phone screen. Not everyone has an 85"" TV. This seems so basic to me.",/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2022,DeadMansTrousers,3," Started off decent but fell apart so fast
","Most people remember this court case and would be interested in watching a mini-series based off it, but this is not worth the time or effort. It started off as a factual representation of what happened and then it turned into a fictional dramatisation featuring musical numbers and overly dramatic scenes that have nothing to do with the court case. I think the creators probably did this to appeal to a younger audience but I found it frustrating and distracting.",/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2022,brittneyhayes,5," Interesting for the first couple episodes but now dragged out
",The show seems to jump from the past to present with no real indication. It can be jarring and annoying. This had potential to being an incredibly addictive series but it's just too dragged out and occasionally confusing. Elle Fanning is sensational though. Let's be honest - she is the reason I'll finish this series.,/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2022,BillyJessup,4," Just Watch ""I Love You, Now Die""
","I have always been a bigger fan of documentaries rather than reenactments. For those of you who agree with that statement, just watch the HBO documentary ""I Love You, Now Die."" I started this and then realized how pointless it is to watch people re-enacting a story and there being ""events that are dramatized"" (as per the statement in the opening first episode) when you can just watch the real deal. Similar to The Dropout, where you can just watch The Inventor documentary about Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes.",/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2022,bianca-423-52002,8," Elle!
","Elle Fanning does an amazing job on this - she portrays the desperate teen grasping for every bit of attention she can get superbly. As for the series, only three episodes in, so I can't comment on the plot in its entirety - but there are already such negative reviews on here from people that have probably watched ten minutes of it, so I wanted to balance it out and let people know that Elle's acting alone is a good enough reason to give this show a chance and the real life events it's based on make a great story.",/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2022,bosporan,3," Exploitative and voyeuristic - despite that, devoid of entertainment
","The first three episodes suffice to demonstrate this is cynically abusive television manipulatively generating an audience on the back of a tragedy. Questionable though this is, it is not completely egregious as much fine drama has emerged from wretched situations. Despite that, the difficulty here lies with the execution. This show is poorly written, a cluster jumble of viewpoints, wooden characters and snail-like pacing. It is challenging to imagine how tedious and turgid the advertised eight episodes will be!",/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2022,nathan-p-hart,6," Another dragged out docuseries
",Intriguing story. But so far pacing is terrible. A mini series off a few episodes would have sufficed. I am getting tired off over dramatized docuseries. I would have given it 4 stars but Chloe Sevigny is carrying the entire show. She's so good.,/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2022,paul-allaer,8," Chilling , depressing and sad but nevertheless must-see TV
","As Episode 1 ""The Girl From Plainville"" (2022 release; 8 episodes of about 45 min each) opens, the local cops are following up on a missing person report about a young guy named Conrad. His black Ford pickup is eventually located, with Conrad having committed suicide. When the news of Conrad's death reaches Michelle, his (supposed) girlfriend, she bursts out in tears. Her parents don't understand it, as they've never heard her mention Conrad, let alone meet him. At this point we are 10 min into Episode 1.",/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2022,sofia36,3," Interesting true story / boring tv show
",This show is based on an interesting case so I expected it to be good. Unfortunately I found the storyline difficult to follow because of the constant flash backs and day dreaming episodes. I couldn't tell what was real and what was a fantasy. I agree with other reviewers that the casting is off and the acting is not great. The actor playing Conrad was too old for the part (like 10 years too old). He looks like a grown man and not a teenager and he seems creepy at times. The actress playing Conrad's mother makes her seem psychotic.,/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,catfanatic888,7," Worth A Watch
",First I had my feelings about this actual story years ago but I adore Elle Fanning so am watching it. She is perfectly cast in the leading role. Some have criticized her detached affect but I feel she nailed the part. It's a sad story but it's interesting seeing it from all sides especially hers. This is worth a watch.,/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2022,DudeAtTheMovies,4," Not enough real material for 8 episodes
","Unfortunately this series has a number of sciences that are imagined that did not actually happen. That really distracts from the actual story. If you only have material for five episodes, then please don't stretch to eight out of obligation. A real bummer. It could have been so much better.",/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2022,becinreallife,4," More like the girl from Slow-ville
","Although the acting from Elle Fanning is on point, I have to say that the show is very drawn out and slow. I keep waiting for more to happen in each episode but nothing much ever does. I think you could have summed up the first 6 episodes into about 3. Hanging out for the last few and hoping it'll pick up a bit.",/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2022,Her-Excellency,3," Overhyped and definitely overrated.
","While not supremely terrible, the acting was mediocre and the story was all splotched and thrown together in a series of badly edited flashbacks and fast-forwards - and a few scenes which might have just been fantasies that the main character was having. There really was no clear indication of where the series went at any given time.",/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv

29 March 2022,smith-miq,9," Excellent so far but very sad
","Very sad but a very important subject, life is so tough for teens. The documentary was such a brutal watch, this series will be just as hard. Hope the families are ok with this portrayal of there kids. Again I'm enjoying this but it's a sad story of real life.",/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2022,sharkcutter-imdb,4," Bitterly Disappointing
","The cast, the acting, the premise all pointed to a good show. Sadly this one fell very short. The biggest single issue is that if it were 4 episodes it would have been great, there simply is not enough story fill 8 episodes. Couple this with some very confusing editing, jumping backward and forwards in time, mixed with fantasy scenes it is a big mushy mess.",/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2022,Kim_jee,5," Horrible editing
","The premise and storyline is good, but the horrible editing makes it seem like there is no continuity between the scenes. I don't know if it's the director's vision or scene editors were lazy or what.. transition between scenes seem very abrupt.",/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2022,laqsheyo,6," I expected a lot from this show but...
","Just watched the 1st three episodes of this Hulu original, 1st episode is average, 2nd is awesome, 3rd is boring (very slow). It would have been better if they had released all 8 episodes at once of 30 minutes (or less) duration. I liked the cast (especially Elle), story, direction and the dialogues but this show is so slow, editor could have done a way better job.",/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2022,abeyeast,3," Too soon ?
","I have a hard time even focusing on reviewing the acting because I feel uncomfortable watching this story dramatized. I think this subject should have just stayed as a documentary ( I love you, now die).",/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2022,nancyldraper,5," Long, Boring and Unsubstantial
","This should never have been an 8 episode series. Its length did not offer depth of perspective but was merely too much of the same thing. People drawn to the series hoping to get insight into Michelle Carter's motivations will find the crumbs offered up by the writers to be limited and insubstantial. Fans who follow Elle Fanning will be glad to see her but not overwhelmed by her portrayal. It is hard to inhabit a poorly drawn character. There were attempts to mix the storytelling (musical numbers, turning texts into face to face conversations) but they all felt like padding if a failed narrative. Inevitably, this is a sad tales of two lives lost to tragic situations. I give this series a 5 (long, boring and unsubstantial) out of 10. {Crime Drama}",/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2022,jennifermalice,10," Some of us appreciate the depth
","I don't understand how some people can be so crude and impatient. This series does an amazing job showing the entire story considering how cut and dry it was portrayed in the media. I felt very one sided about it until watching 'I love you, now die' and learning how much depth there is. This is not a simple case and I don't know if it's people having shorter attention spans now or what, but if you're an avid true crime fan and enjoy well rounded information as I do then you probably won't be able to stop yourself from binging this series. I have never been more confused at how to feel about a situation in my life, this case will leave you deep in thought.",/review/rw8077068/?ref_=tt_urv
