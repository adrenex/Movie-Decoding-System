1 December 2019,borgolarici,5," Entertaining but gets tired soon
","The concept is gold: maladjusted adult tries to live her unfulfilled teenage dreams.
The realisation is absolutely terrible tho: after an adequately creepy start, the movie script becomes more and more implausible.
There are a lot of over the top moments which I won't spoil which are well delivered but aren't valorised enough.
The final twist feels wasted.",/review/rw5179414/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2019,gaamst,7," Exactly what I was expecting
","Don't understand why people get stuck on realism when they judge this movie. Sure there are a few over-the-top moments, but why does that matter? Not every movie needs to be Oscar bait. It's creepy and menacing, just like it's supposed to be.",/review/rw5179414/?ref_=tt_urv

18 December 2019,punch_p,4," Ma is a few more drafts from perfection, but the actor playing her is the real deal.
","Ma might be the latest horror show from the omniscient Blumhouse Productions, but it also serves as a particularly effective anti-bullying PSA.",/review/rw5179414/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2019,kyleallencole9,6," Not bad
","This one was surprisingly good. Its revealed right away that Ma is disturbed. Parts of the film reveal a backstory to her character from a past trauma from high school involving a couple of the main teens parents. Her loneliness makes her become attached to the teens in this film and then turns ugly when they reject her.
These kind of films usually use a young antagonist for the part, just this one went a different way and used a grown adult. The violence towards the end was pretty disturbing. Some of the deaths are towards the last half of the film. I was just expecting a larger and more intense showdown at the end, but it was pretty brief.",/review/rw5179414/?ref_=tt_urv

","The 16 year-old Maggie (Diana Silvers) and her mother Erica (Juliette Lewis) move from San Diego to a small town in the Mississippi to start a new life. Soon Maggie befriends a group of teenagers from the high-school and together they befriend the nice Sue Ann (Octavia Spencer), who works at the local pet shop. She invites the teenagers to drink and party at her house but what they do not know is that Sue Ann is a psychotic woman that is plotting a revenge.",/review/rw5179414/?ref_=tt_urv

30 June 2019,BandSAboutMovies,8," Better than expected from a Blumhouse film
","I tend to gravitate toward the exploitation and horror films of the 1970's, when situations would make no sense in movies that couldn't really be classified as anything other than weird. So it's kind of my dream that a movie like Ma was made in 1974 by S. F. Brownrigg, because then the people next to me who were shocked by how strange it got would be absolutely horrified by just how out of control it could get. That said, by 2019 standards, this was a pretty fine film.",/review/rw5179414/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2019,pmtelefon,2," Junk.
","""Ma"" starts off like a Lifetime movie with curses. (That's not a knock on Lifetime movies. I watch a lot of them and even the bad ones are better than this movie.) But after a while, ""Ma"" leaves the R rated Lifetime road and gets lost between psychological drama and bad horror. Once it goes into the horror zone, it insults the audience with gore. ""Ma"" don't just get bloody, it goes down the ""Saw' type torture porn road. The last half hour of the movie kills any good will that was built up during the first hour. ""Ma"" is the pits.",/review/rw5179414/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2020,jadepietro,4," Mommy Issues
","(Not Recommended) It seems too obvious that the talented Octavia Spencer is hellbent on changing her wholesome image and screen persona. Why else would she pick Ma as a project! This ghoulish story has her playing a deranged women who befriends a group of teenagers and she systemically stalks, tortures, and tries to maim them in a variety of sadistic ways. She's quite good in the role, even if the script is predictable. Director Tate Taylor's pacing is off as he hurries the proceedings to its bloody end. Some may enjoy this horror movie as a guilty pleasure, although to its credit, the movie does try to spend the first hour creating psychological terror and believable characters before showing its gory slasher roots. I saw it as a mediocre torture porn. (Grade: C)",/review/rw5179414/?ref_=tt_urv

13 June 2019,mcorner,7," Say, has anybody seen my sweet Gypsy Rose?
","I liked it. I do think it could have been a bit more fleshed out, but it was decent. Kind of the ultimate bully revenge movie in a way. For a minute when they first introduced Sue Ann's daughter, I thought she was going end up being the result of a rape suffered during Sue Ann's teen years, but that would have made her too old to be known by the current-day teens.",/review/rw5179414/?ref_=tt_urv

","Often people goes to an arty movie and they complain about it being... Well, too arty, and then they go to a flicker and they expect to learn about the meaning of life. This movie is silly, plenty of fun and, contrary of what some say, it gets better towards the end, when everything goes of the rails",/review/rw5179414/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2020,MadamWarden,4," MEDIOCRE MA

5 June 2019,sala151183,6," Ma is just ok!
","We have a Film that tries to deliver a very familiar formula but sadly for 'Ma'
It's just not misery, however Octavia Spencer does a great job in her role as Ma.
The film felt long in the second act, I felt a little bored but started to pick up again for the final act but this don't mean it got any better!!
The first act had me wanting more and with Spencer eventually carrying the film unfortunately she gets lost in a bad a predictable plot.
Ma isn't so bad you shouldn't watch it, it's just not great either.",/review/rw5179414/?ref_=tt_urv

But wait there's more... she also offers up her basement for their illicit activities.

19 June 2019,jackgdemoss,7," An average story improved by a talented lead actress
","The entire genre of horror movies has been improving rapidly over the last 5 years. Where we used to only receive consistent hot garbage, a handful of phenomenal films have snuck their way into the mix each year lately. Ma is not one of those films, but it contributes to the genre by having above average suspense without relying on jump scares. It is ultimately only made possible because of Octavia Spencer's always impressive ability to sink into character.",/review/rw5179414/?ref_=tt_urv
