28 October 2016,juneebuggy,7," Decent enough action thriller, it grew on me by the end.
","This movie tries to be many things; its mostly an action film but also plays heavily into the family drama while throwing in some dark comedy too, all with mixed results.",/review/rw3013075/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2014,tavm,8," Kevin Costner and cast make a good thriller/drama/part-comedy in 3 Days to Kill
","Kevin Costner is a CIA agent who just found out he doesn't have long to live so he agrees to one more assignment from Amber Heard. He has also decided to reacquaint with his estranged wife, Connie Nielsen, and teen daughter, Hailee Steinfeld, in Paris. Oh, and his apartment is inhabited by squatters who he legally can't kick out until the spring. With what I just described, there's plenty of action, drama, and some humor to go along with a pretty entertaining mix of genres that I just was willing to ride along with. The players I mentioned were good enough for this. Really, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this. So on that note, I recommend 3 Days to Kill.",/review/rw3013075/?ref_=tt_urv

","Once again we go to the old well: Dad who has not been there for child because of what he does/Child rejects him at first/he has a terminal illness/wife still loves him but can't accept what he does/still loves wife/and on and on and on. Throw in some really bad guys who have no redeeming qualities. Throw in a mysterious twenty-something knockout blond who is made of ice, orchestrating things for the CIA, and on and on and on. Also the terrible shooting by the bad guys. This is just a plain old, unbelievable (even in its own setting) malarkey. Costner reminded me of Greg House (Hugh Laurie) from the popular TV show. All disheveled and looking like he is going to drop any minute, which he does frequently (unless he can get a few shots of vodka). Here is Kevin Costner whom I think is a respected actor doing this kind of stuff. For me, it was a waste of time.

21 February 2014,bodnarhd,8," Don't take it seriously!
","It is a lot like "" True Lies"" in that a lot of the movie is played for laughs. Amber Heard fits her role very well. Kevin Costner is great as a man who has spent too much time on work and not enough time on his personal life. That is something most of us can relate too. I see people complain about the subplots but they are what make the movie fun. The character actors are great. Not a miss among them. The chase scenes are good with out going over the top. There were only a couple of times where the movie goes to big explosive special effects that take away from the story. The Daughter, played by Hailee Steinfeld, is excellent. Haiee played Mattie Ross in ""True Grit"". It will be a great loss to the screen if she goes into directing like she wants.",/review/rw3013075/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2020,muamba_eats_toast,7," Good but could have been much better
",It seemed in limbo between being a comedy action and a serious action. For me the comedy section was hit and miss and it excelled when it was more serious and the action as a whole was very good. Unfortunately Amber Heard's character optimised this and her whacky appearance seemed out of sync with the rest of the film and the comedy didn't particular work and just felt more strange than anything else. Overall though an easy and enjoyable watch.,/review/rw3013075/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2017,robinrid,8," Really Great movie - why such low rating????
","We can't understand why this movie has such a low rating – it's Luc Besson writing & humour at its most entertaining and Costner – like fine wine – gets better with age – is just great – no flab – it's kinda like Taken but with a few home truths (which came later with Taken.)

21 February 2014,drjgardner,6," Taken for a Ride
","There's not much to recommend this film. Neither the acting, direction, script, music, or photography offer anything new to the genre, and in some cases, it is far below average. Among the actors, only 18 year old Hailee Steinfeld (she plays Costner's daughter) stands out. You'll remember her from ""Enders Game"" and ""True Grit"" and I thought this was her best performance to date. Costner has played this role so many times before he's obviously bored with it, and it doesn't even begin to approach his work in ""The Bodyguard"". Amber Heard is completely miscast, and even if she weren't, the dialog and the crazy costume changes would be difficult to overcome. Indeed Heard's costume changes are a metaphor for the film itself, which doesn't seem to know whether it is a comedy (in which case it fails), an action thriller (which is far too long and not too thrilling), a romance (without much spark by anyone), or just a plain family adventure (with too much violence).",/review/rw3013075/?ref_=tt_urv

","Maybe I should have seen it coming with the 50/50 poster. Maybe I should have seen it with the 50/50 writing credits. This movie has 50/50 written all over it and, no, I'm not talking about the 2011 film starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen but 3 Days To Kill could have learned a thing or two from that film considering the dark subject matter and light- hearted jokes.",/review/rw3013075/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2014,gumperman,7," Very Luc Besson-esque!
","From seeing the trailers, I expected a different kind of action film then what I saw. It doesn't make the film bad by any means, just as I said, not what I was expecting. You could very well tell the Luc Besson influence, who wrote the story, co-wrote the screenplay & produced the film, from the odd pacing / editing of the film. A lot of the dialogue also seemed foreign, and weirdly placed. Again, I'm not saying this is a bad film, just ya know. I envisioned a more action heavy / bare knuckles kind of film and it did have more of a character driven story then I expected, so it still was a nice entertaining film and I loved Costner in this. I kinda feel he's making a strong comeback, that I'm excited for. I say if you like Costner, you love Besson, then this is a film for you! :)",/review/rw3013075/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2014,Robert_duder,8," A completely misrepresented comedy/action about a father and daughter
","Every once in awhile I stumble across a movie that for whatever reason the marketing department decides to completely mislead the audience and misrepresent the movie. I am absolutely certain that at least one of the trailers for this film implied the following. Amber Heard's character poisons Kevin Costner and now he must kill for her in three days or he will die. Does that sound about right? Wrong...wrong wrong!! Comparisons and jokes about Crank were being thrown around and I figured that was the case. This film doesn't even come close to the premise of Crank and I'm going to give it away right now so if you don't want spoilers then stop reading or skip the second paragraph. Kevin Costner is an ageing CIA hit-man, the best in his game, and when an Op goes horribly wrong he discovers he is dying from an inoperable cancer that leaves him with months to live. He returns to Paris to reconnect with his wife and teenage daughter and gets drawn in to the CIA underworld again by Heard when she offers him an experimental drug that COULD prolong his life slightly. Where does the three days to kill come in? Well his wife decides to leave his daughter with him so they can reconnect while she goes away for three days. He and his daughter have ""three days to kill"" together. Obviously there is a slight double entendre given he's a Hit-man but that's all there is to it. This is more comedy than action but the action scenes are also well done. None of what I have said should imply this is a bad film, I had a great time!! It is simply misrepresented in the trailers.",/review/rw3013075/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2014,paris_whitney_hilton_nyc,," Taken 2 Meets 3 Days Of Stupidity **
","3 Days To Kill is your typical run of the mill action movies you've probably seen hundreds of times before . CIA agent Kevin Costner is chasing the Wolf who possesses some dirty nuclear bombs he would love to sell to some very naughty terrorists . The movie begins with the now too familiar shootouts, explosions, chase, and fight scenes . And then comes the idiotic subplots . Costner is dying from brain cancer and has only months to live . Not to worry because a beautiful, fast driving, platinum blonde, leather clad, CIA boss, Amber Heard comes along in the nick of time . She pulls a hypodermic needle the size of a football pump out of her handbag . It contains a not yet FDA approved anti brain cancer drug . This gives Costner a temporary new lease on life . So he goes back to his rundown tenement house located in the shabbiest part of Paris . Well guess what ? A large homeless North African Black family decided to move in to his dilapidated apartment during his absence . They have even taken the liberty of painting his bedroom an awful shade of yellow ! Don't worry, Costner's arsenal of handguns and assault rifles have been well cared for by the older gentleman squatter who now resides there . Subplot number 3 is next as the dying Costner decides to look up his ex wife and rebellious 16 year old daughter he hasn't seen in about 10 years . Predictably, the movie goes from Costner being a complete stranger to the most annoying hands-on, know it all dad, and of course the most merciless cold blooded killer the CIA has ever had . Unfortunately, seductive Amber Heard's sexy scenes are few and far between . I enjoyed seeing her various hair styles and leather dominatrix outfits in this otherwise tedious and imbecilic movie . The ending is similar to that of Taken 2 . All the bad guys, I guess about one hundred , are dead . His wife and daughter love and idolize him dearly , and for Christmas he receives not a necktie but another giant hypodermic horse needle filled with the magic potion to keep him alive a little longer . Hopefully, it's not to make a sequel ! I would rather spend 3 days in the dentist's chair getting a root canal than having to watch 3 Days To Kill again .",/review/rw3013075/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2015,anaconda-40658,5," Three Days to Find a Decent Screenwriter.
","3 Days to Kill (2014): Dir: McG / Cast: Kevin Costner, Hailee Steinfeld, Amber Heard, Connie Nielsen, Richard Sammel: Title references a killing rampage that Kevin Costner is sent on to find a guy who calls himself the Wolf, and an albino. It also references time to spend with his daughter, played by Hailee Steinfeld whom he hasn't seen in years. Connie Nielsen plays his ex-wife who desires that he leave his old life as CIA agent and take an active role in their daughter's life. Enter Amber Heard as a fast driving agent who acquires his services in return for his health. He learns after an opening shootout where the albino gets away, that he only has three months to live. Heard has a drug that can extend his life if he completes the task before him. Directed by McG who improves on the music video style action scenes but the screenplay is pretty much as dead as the numerous henchmen. This is foolish but Costner provides much humour as a CIA agent struggling to balance his career with his family while hiding his condition. Hailee Steinfeld is also effective as his rebellious daughter whose antics keep him on alert more than the dangers of his job. Connie Nielsen is basically there to stay in the distance while anticipating a bed brawl. Amber Heard plays a mysterious eye candy idiot who should get her crap together and just do the job herself, which is ultimately comes down to. Richard Sammel plays a lifeless villain. He was much more interesting in his brief appearance in Inglourious Basterds. Theme of family verses job is evident in its humour otherwise only big Costner fans will spend any days, let alone three viewing this. Score: 5 / 10",/review/rw3013075/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2014,larrys3,2," Hackneyed & Stale
","Huge disappointment here, as I found the script by Adi Hasak and Luc Besson to be terribly stale and hackneyed. It's as if, in my opinion, the filmmakers made no attempt to give the moviegoer anything fresh or that was not shopworn. Plus, I found the characters here to be highly annoying and irritating, despite the fine and talented cast. For me, the attempts at ""campy"" humor just didn't work, but I can see by some of the reviews that others thought differently.",/review/rw3013075/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film was stereotype and formula to the extreme as per the following, seen many times before: 1. Enforcement agent (what type? Doesn't matter.) is having a hard time of it; can't quite get his life together. 2. Divorcée (or about to be) with the now boringly over used added character of a rebellious teen daughter (some films add a younger sibling, and some films alternate gender for either role). 3. Agent dad tries to juggle re-connecting to family and newly added enforcement duties. 4. Usual black market selling of something (this case the usual atomic whatever) to/by the usual Eastern European types (of course an appropriate city needs to be named - none better than Belgrade) with the added bonus of a Middle Eastern destination (guess what country, this year it's got to be Syria - duh!). 5.

25 July 2014,ironhorse_iv,6," I got 3 hours to kill. Was it worth watching? It was alright watch.
","The movie directed by MCG was surprising, very funny and entertaining. It just wasn't well-delivered. The film does uneasily mixes violent action sequences, extreme torture scenes, and surprising lots of drug & nudity with that of a family conflict comedy sitcom. For a PG-13, I was deeply surprised, this movie wasn't Rated R. The movie could had cut-down on a few scenes of the violent. Honestly, there was little to no reason to have nudity, there. The simple story is surprising hard to follow, as the movie has this Deus ex machina attitude to its script. So far that I can gather from, the movie is about a CIA hit-man named Ethan Renner (Kevin Costner) whom is dying from some unrealistic brain tumor. After being kick from the curb by the CIA, after a botch assassination of two criminal arms dealers, the Albino (Tómas Lemarquis) & the Wolf (Richard Sammel). Ethan return to his former life, to fix his relationship with his estranged daughter, Zoey (Hailee Steinfeld) & and his ex-wife, Christine (Connie Nielsen) with his remaining time. This is where the script by Luc Besson of 1994's Leon fame, get stupid. Because the plot calls for it, the CIA wants him back and recruits him to find and kill the Wolf, in exchange for an experimental drug that could extend his life significantly. First off, isn't that Vivi Delay's job to kill Wolf? (Amber Heard). She's supposed to be a CIA elite hit-woman, but she does nothing, but dress sexy and acts like Ethan's drug dealer. What the hell was the point of her outrageous places to meet like strip club or the aquarium? I really don't buy her as a CIA agent. Seeing no way out of it, Ethan sign up and forced to live two lives: one of the family man, the other as a CIA agent. Due to this, the plot really advance in a really slow pace, that quickly gets interrupted by sub-plots filler scenes like Ethan having to deal with a family of African squatters living in his Paris apartment or rescuing her daughter from rapist from a night club. You can take both scenes away, and you still have the main plot. Honestly, the plot makes little to no sense due to lack of exposition. It's like the yin to 2006's Crank's yang. What's honestly does the drug do? You see, Ethan suffer from hallucinogenic effects, but you can't tell if it's from the drug or the lack of it, anyways it doesn't make sense that Ethan must consume alcohol to get his heart rate low. His heart rate goes too high, which he can control only by consuming alcohol. How did he not get alcohol poisoning or have any effects? The movie feels like it support the unhealthy lifestyle of mixing drugs with alcohol. It's scary, how pro-alcoholism, the movie is. For a movie about living a double life, the movie really has no consequences about it. Not once is Ethan's family even threaten. You would think all the times, that Ethan bring criminals to his house to be torture, not once, came back with men to get revenge. It doesn't make sense. Also, if bouncer doesn't let you into a nightclub, shoot him a couple of times in public. Nobody will notice. There is little logic to some of these violent scenes. Watching it, you thought that there is more to the story, than it is, but toward the end, you realize that the movie has little to no twist complexity. It felt such a let-down. You would think a movie like this, would had a better climax. For the most part, the movie action was pretty entertaining. The humor was mostly hit than misses. The running gag with the bike and the run-in with the gang's limousine driver, Mitat Yilmaz (Marc Andréoni) was hilarious. All of the actors play their roles very well. Kevin Costner was great as the lead. He takes center stage and it's good to have him back in the role. Still, the dad who wasn't there cliché is getting old. Great acting from supporting characters. I honestly like the amusing father-daughter moments with Hailee Steinfeld. She was amazing in her role, and hope to see more of her in future films. The Paris location was beautiful and breath-taking. Still, makes me wonder why a CIA American agent is doing living in Paris with his clearly not French ex-wife. The movie was release with a Theatrical Version and the Unrated Version. There isn't much differs between them besides more nudity in the strip club scene. I do think, some critics do over-judge it, because it has Kevin Costner, and he hasn't been in much good movies in years. Yes, the movie doesn't take itself too serious, but I think it is one reason why the movie stands out for me. Overall: 3 Days to Kill was entertainment if you're willing to suspense your disbelief. It's a fun watch.",/review/rw3013075/?ref_=tt_urv
