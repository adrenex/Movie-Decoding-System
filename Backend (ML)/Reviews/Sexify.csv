4 May 2019,bestford,2," Quite awful
",I grew up with the twilight zone and tales from the crypt and tales of the unexpected. This is comparison is just awful. The story's are boring they just aren't gripping or spine tingling. It's a no from me.,/review/rw7797761/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2020,westsideschl,3," Not the Original
","Having seen the original I expected something at least as good. I gave it every opportunity, but unfortunately it failed my class evaluation.
1. The slightly contemporized opening music & graphics meant to play off of the original seemed cartoonish & failed to convey foreboding mystery.
2. The narrator presented a shallow monotonous lecture drone to open/close each episode. Again, no mystery.
3. Characters in many episodes were excessively stereotyped, i.e. in one episode all the cops were nasty, old white males while the demonstrators were mostly attractive young blacks.
4. Seemed to proselytize on some issues such as 2nd Amendment gun rights. Even though I agree with the scripts stance that regulation & control are rational & needed, but forceful overbearing lecturing is not a good way to discuss the issues.
5. Acting & dialogue all weak. Overall the original series has been let down.",/review/rw7797761/?ref_=tt_urv

8 May 2020,DrTuvok,1," Here's what they need to do....
","First off, are these the same people involved with the abysmal Star Trek reboots who are making this? I wouldn't be surprised, only against all odds this new Twilight Zone is even worse then Discovery or Picard. There's apparently going to be a Season 2 so I will now give this shows creators some advice on how to actually make the show reach the level of at least the previous Twilight Zone revivals.",/review/rw7797761/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2019,mpres-85214,1," Glad Mr. Serling wasn't around to watch this train wreck
","I've been watching the Twilight Zone since it began in the 50's. Great writers and Serling made it unique and produced true classics. Authors from Bradbury to Matheson created wondrous tales of science fiction and horror. The new series has disappointed in every way. Not a single show produced anything near good. Even trying to copy past classics failed miserably. The host sounds like he's bored to death and a cardboard cutout would have fared better.
I was truly hoping for better material. All we got was better special effects, swearing and poor plots. Not really an upgrade but a sign of how TV is lacking in so many ways.
I wish I could recommend this I really do. But I cannot. It is poorly made entertainment riding on the back of true greatness.",/review/rw7797761/?ref_=tt_urv

7 May 2019,msgpat,1," Proof there's no life after death!
","All the other 1/10 reviewers have said it for me - except one thing, and that is that this piece of badly written/directed piece of propaganda proves that there's no life after death, 'cos if there were, Rod Serling would seek out those responsible for insulting his memory, and dispose of them slowly and painfully.",/review/rw7797761/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2019,pietclausen,2," Irritable watching
","What may have worked as far back as 1959 does not work in 2019, even if the program is given a modern look. Having watched the first 3 episodes, with one other in the pipeline, it is time to say it is an irritable series to watch. Episode 2 was acceptable, showing some mystery and intrigue, but the others were annoying, uninteresting stories which looked spurious.",/review/rw7797761/?ref_=tt_urv

12 May 2021,westsideschl,3," No Mystery
","No mystery or emotion, superficial, lacked depth, starting with opening intro of music & moderator. Had the impact of a used denture salesperson. For those who saw the original - this was a let down. However, some stories did have some creepy originality.",/review/rw7797761/?ref_=tt_urv

5 June 2019,Sanpaco13,1," In your face political garbage
","The only episode I half enjoyed was the remake of the Nightmare at 10,000 Feet. It was a modern twist on the original without any political agenda. From there each episode was clearly a commentary on some political hot topic. Black lives matter, metoo, illegal immigration, Trump. I don't watch fictional television to get the talking points I hear on cable news. What an epic fail of a show that I was really excited about.",/review/rw7797761/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2019,myriamlenys,3," Not the stuff of storytelling magic
","Before launching into the review, I'd like to clarify something. I do not, as a matter of principle, dislike movies or series that try to make a philosophical, religious or political point, even if the views expressed do not coincide with my own. (I make an exception for movies or series that sell despicable ideologies, especially along the lines of ""I belong to the bestest club in the world, and all non-members are less than filth beneath my shoes"".) So no, I'm not criticising ""The Twilight Zone"" because it has a political agenda - in this specific case, a left-leaning political agenda - or because it treats political issues. There's nothing wrong with societal relevance or public debate, on the contrary.",/review/rw7797761/?ref_=tt_urv

24 April 2019,ivko,4," disappointing
","So, you only need to read a few reviews to know why some people have a pretty severe negative reaction to this show. No two ways about it, this show has a very left of center ""woke"" perspective. But honestly, that's not what bothered me, or at least it's not the message so much as the delivery. Science fiction and fantasy have a long history of social commentary. It's a big part of why I like it, but the reason why I like it is because it allows you to communicate ideas to people in a package that slips past the barriers we all erect against the views of people we don't like or don't agree with.",/review/rw7797761/?ref_=tt_urv

12 April 2019,cameronskye94,5," Rod Serling would be disappointed with CBS
","Change the title of the show and this could be a hit. What I find to be the most common mistake, regarding the attempts to revive this anthology, is the lack of theatre. This is why I believe this show cannot be remade. Rod Sterling, the original creator of the series, would be appalled with the profanity and explicit behavior depicted on the show. Separate from the incredible actors and guests in the new episodes, the continuous jump cuts and poor cinematography take away certain characteristics from the storytelling.
While I believe Serling pushed his viewers to the boundaries of imagination while shedding light on taboo social topics, the new revival ironically backfires with the poor script writing and lack of creative language. ""Suck my p****"", a line in the first episode that instantly caught my attention as poorly written. On the other hand, Jordan Peele's depiction as The Narrator is incredible and his dialogue is told with much needed care.
In the original series, take note that many scenes feature incredible monologues and little need for scene-cutting. It is truly theatrical. Example, a popular episode starring William Shatner titled ""Nick of Time"", when two newlyweds are confined to a diner by a fortune-telling machine. This episode takes place almost entirely inside a diner with a simple 2-shot camera set up with a few insert shots.
Many of the original Twilight Zone episodes are produced in this manor. Respectively, Rod Serling and the producers did not have the biggest budget to film the original series. Also the lack of technology forced the use of practical effects in this era of film, which helped push the storytelling into dialogue-driven tales. This does not translate into the new series very well, thus letting down fans of the original series.",/review/rw7797761/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2020,drunken_munki,4," The Woke Zone
","Sorry, I can't take this seriously. The third episode literally falls apart in nonsensical gibberish, and instead of some supernatural thing or weirdness it is just a story that beats the same dead horse that white people are all racists, and black people are not.",/review/rw7797761/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2022,perrycs-49152,2," Heavy agenda based TV show - very little science fiction
","Episode one was tolerable. Episode 2 was better. Episode 3 had the most potential to be amazing but it was so heavy agenda driven I couldn't enjoy it. I also can't comment more because despite previous comments in previous years being allowed to say certain things almost all my comments regarding agenda based TV are never put up on the website. So, who knows... maybe IMDB is now censoring even more comments.",/review/rw7797761/?ref_=tt_urv
