15 January 2005,SmileysWorld,8," Keaton shines as the villain!
","Prior to this film,we only saw Michael Keaton in comedic,and good guy roles.In Pacific Heights,he proves to us that he is not afraid to turn on us and be the bad guy.Keaton is excellent as Carter Hayes,the worst kind of no account,as he knows how to stay just out of reach of the law. The character is very similar to that of Max Cady in Cape Fear,though Cady is the far more memorable of the two.Carter Hayes is a nightmarish tenant wreaking havoc on the lives of his helpless landlords,wonderfully played by Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine.I consider this film to be an overlooked classic that never really got the attention it deserved,perhaps because no one wanted to see Keaton,particularly after his Batman success,as a villain.Those looking for a modern day ""Hitchcock-esque"" thriller will find a winner here.Thumbs up!",/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv

",Drake Goodman (Matthew Modine) and his girlfriend Patty Palmer (Melanie Griffith) are stretching their finances to the limit to buy a San Francisco house.

The couple gets Stephanie MacDonald (Laurie Metcalf) as their lawyer.,/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 1999,Tito-8,7," Flawed, but good enough
","This film didn't completely win me over like I was hoping it would, but some solid acting, a good premise, and a few clever scenes made it worthwhile. There was never anything particularly suspenseful about the film, and you pretty much know who will win by the end, but the loathesome Michael Keaton character helped to keep me interested throughout.  There were also a few things that especially annoyed me, including the terminally stupid Matthew Modine character, but this movie just has too many positives for me to dwell on the negatives.  It's by no means perfect, but it's an effective thriller nonetheless.",/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv

5 August 2004,vertigo_14,7," Why Background Checks Are A Good Idea... (spoilers)
","Pacific Heights is a great movie is you're in the mood for good suspense. It is the tale of two newlyweds (Melanie Griffith as Patty; Matt Modine as Drake), slightly short on reasonable income, who buy a hefty house in Pacific Heights. Being a larger house than they initially intended to buy, they rent out the floors. One goes to a polite Asian couple. The other, to a wealthy man (Michael Keaton as Carter Hayes) who is in the business of real estate scams. ",/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2013,seymourblack-1,8," Definitely Not ""Run Of The Mill""
","It's very unusual for a conflict between a house-owning couple and a strange tenant to provide the plot for a psychological thriller but in ""Pacific Heights"", that's exactly what happens. This set-up is initially intriguing but soon takes on a darker complexion as it gradually becomes apparent just how sinister and dangerous the newest occupant of the house really is. The tension then builds steadily as the conflict becomes increasingly intense and the stakes get higher.",/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2005,rinkedo,9," Pacific Heights is Educational
","Pacific Heights is required viewing in all Apartment Management courses in San Diego County. It is a chilling tale of decent but uneducated and unprepared new owners with a dream unknowingly up against a seasoned player in the professional renter game. This viewing requirement is one of the tools used to introduce starry-eyed management newcomers to the harsh and not-so-easily apparent world of the sick, the dangerous and the sue-happy portion of the rental market who will try to get the management stripped of all their personal assets and possessions, fired and possibly jailed, who work diligently to get the owner's property away from him/her, and who have no objection to going down as long as they can take others with them. Great movie.",/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 1999,DennisLittrell,7," Tenants are the curse of the propertied class
","This is a carefully programmed yuppie nightmare, something to titillate the emotions betwixt the sushi and the creme de mint, something to remind the upwardly mobile that you have to keep your guard up at all times because there are animals out there waiting to take it all away from you.",/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2005,lee_eisenberg,10," Melanie Griffith looked better before she messed up her lips.
","If Fred and Ethel Mertz had ever seen ""Pacific Heights"", they might have thought twice about giving Lucy and Ricky an apartment - and I don't mean that in a funny way. When San Francisco renters Patty Palmer (Melanie Griffith) and Drake Goodman (Matthew Modine) fix up an apartment, they sell it to newcomer Carter Hayes (Michael Keaton). But something's not quite right about this guy. And when they ask him to leave, things get really ugly.",/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2007,DavidSim240183,8," Maddeningly vague, but surprisingly effective
","Pacific Heights is unusual among psycho-thrillers because of its completely different approach to psychological terror. Instead of a Freddy Krueger or a Michael Myers we have Michael Keaton as a psychotic tenant who makes life hell for his landlords Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine. Knowing every legal loophole in the book, his weapons of choice are restraining orders and civil suits, not butcher knives and chainsaws. Driving them to increasingly desperate measures to evict him, Keaton dreams up new and more sadistic methods to torment them.",/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2018,junomartin,," Great thriller from 1990.
",Pacific Heights works because of Michael Keaton. Pacific Heights is an underrated movie and has Michael Keaton playing a sinister role as the tenant from hell. Melanie Griffith and Mathew Modine play a yuppie San Francisco couple who rent out their sublet to others. Unfortunately Michael Keaton- a rich but shady customer enters the fray and immediately convinces them to let him stay. It's a psychological thriller with a nice setting. I suggest you go in with an open mind.,/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2021,BA_Harrison,8," Bad new tenant.
","Fatal Attraction (1997), The Stepfather (1997), Single White Female (1992), Poison Ivy (1992), The Hand That Rocks The Cradle (1992), Fear (1996): the late'-80s/'90s saw a trend for 'cautionary tale', thrillers that warned us to be careful about who we let into our life. Pacific Heights fits squarely into this sub-genre, showing us how sharing a home with a total stranger can be a huge mistake.",/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2006,ccthemovieman-1,4," Disappointing; Needed More Of Keaton
","What hurt my rating in this movie was that friend said ""It was the scariest, most suspenseful film I've ever seen!"" Well, I didn't find this to be the tense thriller she said.....or even close. Since I expected more, I was disappointed.",/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2004,shattenjager777,7," The last 10 minutes
","William Goldman says that the last 15 minutes are the most important of any movie and that's what saves what is otherwise a sometimes fascinating but often dull film in ""Pacific Heights.""",/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2016,Mr-Fusion,5," Surprisingly dull effort from the guy behind ""Marathon Man""
","I was looking forward to Michael Keaton playing the heavy, but ""Pacific Heights"" is the wrong vehicle for that. He's playing the tenant from Hell, terrorizing couple-of-the-year Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine, but I can only describe this is a real estate thriller - which is just as exciting as it sounds. Keaton goes from mustache-twirling to psychological manipulator, but the writing doesn't offer much to go on. His motivations are specious, while Modine's mood swings leave Griffith as the only character to root for. That's no secret, and it's why she's the one to get revenge.",/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2005,rycarson,," underrated film
","I saw this movie again recently, and I have to say that upon reconsideration I think this film is a bit underrated. There are a few deeper sociological issues being explored here that I perceive but are quite subtle in their appearance in the film.",/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2016,Uriah43,6," Featuring a Dark and Sinister Villain
","This movie begins with a man named ""Carter Hays"" (Michael Keaton) in bed with a woman when suddenly the door bursts open and two men enter and proceed to beat him with a baseball bat. The film then shifts to a man by the name of ""Drake Goodman"" (Matthew Modine) and his girlfriend ""Patty Parker"" (Melanie Griffith) buying a large Victorian house with the intent on renting some of the rooms out in order to help pay off their sizeable mortgage. Unfortunately, one of the first people to apply for a rent is Carter who convinces Drake to forgo the usual procedures and disregard the normal paperwork. Big mistake--as from that point on Drake's life quickly spirals out-of-control due to Carter's evil manipulations. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is the type of film that is was an interesting movie for the most part which included a good performance by Michael Keaton as the dark and sinister villain. On the other hand, the repeated violent outbursts of Drake got a bit old after the first time or two and ruined any sympathy I might have had for him. Even so, although this isn't a film that I would want to see more than once or twice, it was good enough for the time spent and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv

29 May 2019,ags123,8," Go Fly a Kite
","Close to thirty years after it was made, ""Pacific Heights"" remains an entertaining thriller. Its lack of cell phones and computers is outweighed by a plot that still resonates today. The story has lots of twists and turns, some more outlandish than others, but they're what make the film so watchable and fun. Michael Keaton usually gets all the acclaim for his characterization of a mad sociopath, but Melanie Griffith (looking beautiful pre- plastic surgery) turns in an excellent leading performance as well. Matthew Modine's contribution is not to be overlooked (love his little kite factory). All the casting is on target, including Laurie Metcalf as a lawyer and Tippi Hedren as a socialite. What separates this film from others in the genre is John Schlesinger's astute direction. Schlesinger (who makes a cameo appearance in an elevator) wasn't known to direct many thrillers (Marathon Man) but his keen eye on human behavior (Midnight Cowboy, The Day of the Locust) elevates this film to a higher level.",/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2019,imseeg,6," Starts out promising, slowly deteriorates towards the end. Still a reasonably enjoyable Hollywood formula picture, which feeds on creepy gut feelings.
","When I watch a thriller I have to believe that what I am seeing could (remotely) happen in real life. Otherwise I wont be scared at all. This movie starts out creepy and promising, but towards the end the story doesnt make much sense any more, which deflates the suspense that was there at the beginning. Therefore the thrill of this movie stops halfway through.",/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv

26 July 2002,tfrizzell,," Lows.
","Sick little film has the dark and shady Michael Keaton terrorizing Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine after he rents the ground-floor apartment from the young couple. Keaton is truly frightening as the wild psychopath who just will not leave, but he gets no support from the rest of the cast. When Keaton finally decides he has done all he can to make life a living hell he takes off, but Griffith wants her revenge. This is supposedly based on a true story, but in the end a stumbling screenplay and unclear direction by John Schlesinger keeps ""Pacific Heights"" from reaching as high as it should have reached. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2003,MovieAddict2016,," I got what I expected...
","""Pacific Heights"" is based on a true story, about a couple who rent out an apartment to a crazy scam man, played by Michael Keaton in the film, who reak havoc. Needless to say, this is a very basic and very predictable ""thriller,"" if that is what you want to call it, but it's more of a character study, and despite its predictability it IS very watchable.",/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2020,MOscarbradley,7," A home-invasion movie from a time before the term became popular.
","A home invasion movie from a time before the term was even fashionable, ""Pacific Heights"" is a classic 'tenant from hell' picture. John Schlesinger filmed it in San Francisco in 1990 and it's about what happens when new landlords and romantic partners Matthew Modine and Melanie Griffith 'rent' an apartment in their house to Michael Keaton. I say 'rent' though Mr Keaton doesn't actually pay them any money; he just moves in like a cuckoo in the nest and takes over with the intention, it seems, of getting the rightful owners out and that thing, a certain Mr Bumble called 'a ass', the law, would appear to be on his side.",/review/rw0286555/?ref_=tt_urv
