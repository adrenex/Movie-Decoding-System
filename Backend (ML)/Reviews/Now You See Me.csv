11 April 2022,cgvsluis,7," New mystery series...which I am excited for and hope will just get better and better.
","This was an interesting cast of characters held together by the two leads...Detective Tom Schultz and divorced single mom/caterer Goldie. First in what I assume is a new series, this was just a little rough around the edges...but showed promise. The mystery itself was decent enough that my initial suspect was not the killer, which I really appreciated.",/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2022,Calicodreamin,6," Cute hallmark romance murder mystery
","While it didn't go strictly by the book, the curious caterer mysteries for more than a few things right. The storyline was well developed and not entirely predictable. Leads had good chemistry. Ending was abrupt, I'll be needing a sequel.",/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2022,stacyavary,6," Too different

","This is a few cuts above ""Cut, Color, Murder "", (pun intended) but doesn't come close to ""Mystery 101"".",/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2022,aussiegirl-65915,6," Meh!
","It was ok. I usually love Andrew Walker but in this case he didn't seem over enthused in playing the role and always looked miserable. Also what's with men and the scruff on their faces. They just look untidy and too lazy to shave. In Andrew's case it made him look old. Sorry, Mystery 101 is still my favourite.",/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2022,rebekahrox,4," Do-over needed for a dynamic duo.
",The only thing good about this one was the chemistry between good-friends-in-real-life Andrew Walker and Nikki Deloach. They were great together. But no one behaved like normal humans would in their professional or private lives. They would either get fired or be shunned by the community. It was a silly premise and everyone behaved like idiots.,/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2022,pattersonjamie-12079,8," Hope they do more
",Nikki Deloach and Andrew Walker are really good together. The chemistry between them is good and they were humorous in this movie.,/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv

17 April 2022,MIssM19,6," Quite anticlimactic.
","Goldy, a caterer and a civilian, helps local detective Tom solve a suspicious accident, afterwards ruled a murder of a close friend of hers.",/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2022,takeheart-67776,8," Andrew and Nikki go together like chocolate and shortbread.
",Love the two main actors! Nikki and Andrew really made the show. They're very talented. They fit the roles well and know the importance of facial expressions and body language to really enhance the reality of a scene. I'm looking forward to seeing them in more mysteries.,/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2022,ISmellSnow,7," Great chemistry
",Andrew and Nikki have great chemistry but it's hard to take Andrew seriously in this role. Not sure if I can believe that he's a big city cop. I didn't predict the killer from the beginning which is a pro for me. I think I'd like to see at least 1 more of these movies to truly make up my mind if this should be a series.,/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2022,Ekm828511,7," Good start for the series
",Best Hallmark mystery movie so far for 2022-I love the Nikki/Andrew pairing and know their movies have done well with ratings in the past. Hoping to see more movies to this series in the future!,/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2022,Jackbv123,5," Tipped my meter
","I'll tell you two things right off: 1) I love Nikki DeLoach. I think she is Hallmark's best actor, male or female. Andrew Walker is in the top half, at least. 2) I am very picky when it comes to these Signature Mysteries.",/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2022,JoBloTheMovieCritic,6," Dying for Chocolate: A Curious Caterer Mystery
",6/10 - pretty good start to what is presumably a new mystery series on Hallmark Movies & Mysteries with capable leads in Nikki Deloach & Andrew Walker and an interesting mystery.,/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2022,Sergiodave,7," A strong beginning
","The first movie in a mystery series is all about getting to know the characters and their interaction with each other, and this did that well. To be honest I would have been surprised if it didn't work considering a good cast led by two of my favourite Hallmark actors. Good family entertainment, and hope to see plenty more.",/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2022,nora-60198,7," Fun mystery!
","Nikki Deloach is one of my favorite Hallmark actors. The movie was enjoyable to watch although the writing could have been better. Hopefully, this will turn into a series.",/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2022,barneybeth,9," Fun
","A delightful movie from Hallmark. I have enjoyed all of their mystery movies. I hope they make another one with the Curious caterer. Enjoy the scenery, the two lead players, and the realistic dialogue.",/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2022,xbatgirl-30029,8," Really liked it
","As someone who didn't even know this was based on a series of books, I really enjoyed this and look forward to sequels. Reading other reviews now that say in the books Goldy's ex was physically abusive, I'm actually glad that was left out. It seems too serious for a Hallmark mystery. I've been a casual fan of Lochlan Munro since maybe the 90s. I know he could play that character. But I prefer Goldy now having a good relationship with him and their issues in the past. The one character that didn't do it for me was Marla. She was just too generic Hallmark - size zero with those super annoying crispy tendrils hanging over her face. Now I find out she was completely changed from how she was in the book. I think the change was a bad idea. Not the actress's fault. It's just casting.",/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2022,kjc-32205,1," Recipe for disaster...
","What do you get when you mix a really stellar cast with an abysmal script and subpar directing? The Curious Caterer: Dying for Chocolate. Compared to the awesome lineup of sleuth mysteries and lead pairings on the Hallmark Channel, this one falls so flat. And I love Andrew Walker. I love love Nikki DeLoach. I LOVE Antonio Cayonne. But this movie... woefully underserved these incredible actors. Someone should have said, "" Uh, no. Let's take this back to the writing desk and tighten some things up."" Please, no more like this...",/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv

17 April 2022,maggie1224,10," Not your traditional Who Done It...
","I love anything that these two are featured in. I hope that this is one of MANY more movies by this writer... The books are great, so lots of material for future movies... I did find it strange that the detective was so quick to allow a simple caterer assist him with a murder, but, meh, that was the only issue I had with the story line. It was a good find on TV, have missed a quality Hallmark Mystery, these two made the wait for something new worth it!",/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2022,sarajimi,7," not for fans of the book series
","The movie is fine on its own. Maybe i'm biased because i like andrew walker. Normally, i like nikki deloach as well but not so much here. Not that she was bad, she just didn't feel like she was owning the role. It's a typical hallmark mystery with a few more suspects than usual so not an obvious solution. My main complaint is why'd they bother tying it into the book series? Granted, the series was/is popular but the book of the same name was written in the 80s; surely there are more recent properties you could use to get a ready-made audience? Or were they hoping no one who saw the movie had read the book? The similarities were minimal. Yes, movie and book goldys are both divorced caterers with children but thats as far as the similarities go. Book goldy has an established business at the time of this story, her ex-husband was (and still is) abusive, their divorce is contentious to say the least, her child is a son, and that's just some of the character differences. As far as plot goes, the victim dies in a car accident and the common ground ends there. So my question remains - why bother with the tie-in?",/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2022,jlbsword,7," A caterer, a cop, and a crime
","This is yet another effort from Hallmark to create a mystery series based on a successful book series, and which shows little to no similarity. In the books Mike & Goldy are much older, and Goldy has an adult son. Her friend Marla is also older and not nearly as slim because she loves to sample Goldy's treats. Her ex-husband is a creep and an abuser. Of course, none of that is acceptable to the Hallmark style. So, putting all of that aside, viewers can just enjoy this story of two people that join forces to solve crimes and played by the very popular Nicki and Andrew. They do have some chemistry and the story is decent, so let's hope the 2nd one can be even better and reflect the good stories in the books.",/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,kwc-18139,8," Great Couple and Story!!
","In the past I just liked specific movies from Hallmark, not series but they have stepped up the quality of late and diversified their story telling. I always wondered why they never developed a series for these two because they click in everything that they do together. They are officially my IT couple to watch. If you are thinking of watching this series, you wont be disappointed. For some reason Andrew and Nikki's shows/movies tend to have good actors around them along with good story telling.",/review/rw8837426/?ref_=tt_urv
