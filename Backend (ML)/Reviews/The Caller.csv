14 March 2006,Spuzzlightyear,," Manson!
","I first heard of the Ben Stiller Show when I saw the Emmy Awards when it won for best writing of a variety show (I think they showed the ""Counting With Bruce Springsteen"" sketch). Anyways, Stiller was overjoyed at this, and he was saying what a great show this was, and what we were going to miss, as it was only on for 12 episodes. And from that time, I was like, ""Damn, I want to see that!"" Well, finally, through the magic of DVD, I did get to see it! All of the episodes are great (though I have the sneaky suspicion that the earlier episodes were funnier). Well, where can I start about my favorite episodes? OK, I'm sure everyone has different opinions, the highlights for me were Rescue 411, Manson, Skank, Amish Studs, U2: The Early Years, and Beverly Hills 90210240 (and also bonus points for the deleted scene on the DVD with the High School Mascot competition with Stiller as Ron Perlman and Janine Garaefolo as Mary-Lou Retton, Garaefolo can't stop laughing during the commentary for this)",/review/rw5063568/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2005,Superunknovvn,4," Watchable? Yes. Recommendable? No.
","""The Ben Stiller Show"" certainly wasn't a highlight of television comedy, but for all the (justly) bad reputation it has gotten, it isn't as bad as you might think. Although you might not find yourself laugh out loud more than once when watching this show, it's still somewhat enjoyable and entertaining. The kind of thing you watch when nothing else is on. For someone like me, who is living outside the U.S. and never had the chance to see this show when it was new, it's also a pretty intriguing look at pop culture of the early nineties and the so-called ""Generation X"". It's stunning how far away this period of time already is and how aged the jokes seem, because none of them are really relevant anymore. Melrose Place/Beverly Hills, Grunge and Tales From The Crypt are all getting spoofed, some quite cleverly, but since those shows and trends aren't as immediate anymore, the humor has been lost along the way (if it's ever been there in the first place). The cast does a lot to save some of the very predictable sketches. Ben Stiller in particular is a shining light and shows much more versatility than he did in his last movies. His impersonations of Bruce Springsteen, Tom Cruise and Bruce Willis, to name but a few, are dead on and get a chuckle out of you now and then. Still, Colin Quinn gets it right when he states in one of the episodes that Ben Stiller is making fun of Melrose Place-type T.V. characters, but is no different himself. The intro of the show alone will make you cringe with it's ""we are young and independent, yet totally in fashion"" kind of-vibe. It's exactly the kind of program the corporate MTV guy (played by Stiller) made out of Winona Ryder's ""documentary"" in ""Reality Bites"". Stiller seemed to have a hard time being any different from the characters he parodied. Well, we all know how the story continued. Stiller became one of the most successful comedians of today despite the failure of this program. ""The BS Show"" (BS stands for Ben Stiller, in case you were wondering) is where it all began and good for a few hours of slight amusement. Don't expect much more, though.",/review/rw5063568/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2005,yevonwm,," Doesn't quite hit the mark (anymore)
","This show was probably really good in its day but unfortunately it just isn't funny enough to keep watching it. I got hold of a few episodes and although the odd joke is original enough to make you giggle, the general gist of it is more a case of period rebellion that doesn't translate any more. The series relies on a set of cameos that loose their comedy value as some of the actors are even dead now. It's also a bit americanised too, being British i have to hammer this web site to figure out whats going on with some of it. I'll probably try and get hold of the rest of the episodes and if you're a massive ben stiller fan like me, you're best off seeing the show for yourself to understand what i mean. Worth a watch but not hyped.",/review/rw5063568/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2008,GrigoryGirl,2," Should have stayed in the vault....
","This is one of those ""legendary"" TV shows that first appeared in 1992, but then got canceled almost immediately. It gathered a reputation that far exceeded what it actually was, because so many people hadn't seen it, so they thought it was something brilliant that the evil studio networks didn't get. Well, it turned out that the network (in this case Fox) was correct in canceling it, as it is not a particularly good show, but in fact, a lousy one. I saw this show (well, the first 8 episodes) a few years back, and it was painfully bad. The material is mostly parodies from the 1990's (like Beverly Hills 90210, Studs), and unless you're an expert on pop culture from that era, you're not going to get the references. This is always a problem with topical comedy, as it dates immediately and can never been seen outside the time it was made. Even if you do get the references, it's still not particularly funny. There are a few laughs here and there (the B-minus time traveler sketch is the funniest, with Janeane Garofalo playing the not too bright time traveler. Janeane is probably not the best person to play an idiot, as she is quite brilliant in real life), but mostly it's tired, dated, and very full of itself, a quintessential quality of comedy in the smug, ""ironic"" 90's.",/review/rw5063568/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 1999,Sketti,," Unparalleled skit comedy
","I heard that ""In Living Color"" reruns were on cable again (I don't believe it) and if it's true the only thing that needs to be added is Ben Stiller reruns.  The cast on this show was a priceless gem!  Why did this, the funniest skit show I've ever seen, go off the air for ""the Edge""??? That's show biz I guess.  The Ben Stiller Show, along with Simpsons, Seinfeld, and Married With Children, are the only shows I have ever tuned into religiously week after week.  Well, I don't see how it could happen, but if Ben Stiller becomes even BIGGER of a star perhaps the reruns will return.  I need to see this stuff again to reappraise the value of my stupid TV set.",/review/rw5063568/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2003,AtomicAnthony,," Only One Season!!!
","I can't believe that this great show only lasted ONE little season. In my point of view this show was hilarious . It is funny to see Ben Stiller doing original comedy. The skits on the show kept me laughing so hard. There is probably not a chance you can watch this again unless you taped it, but if you ever have to opportunity, Grab it!",/review/rw5063568/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2004,film-critic,," Yabba dabba doo, dabba dooby dabba dooby dabba.
","This series was released back in the early 90s before anyone really fully knew the potential behind the stars of this program. Ben Stiller had yet to become a household name, Andy Dick was  well  not yet Andy Dick, Janeane Garofalo was not politically active, and Bob Odenkirk was just a glimmer in Mr. Show's eyes. Yet, somehow these four key players pulled off some of the funniest skits to ever hit television.",/review/rw5063568/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2006,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7," Ahead of its time, but not always funny
","Thirteen episodes... one season(well, half of one, by typical American airing standards). That's how long this lasted. Over the past three months and one week, a Danish network has aired one episode every Friday night, and I haven't missed a single one. I don't have any particular attachment to Ben Stiller... he can be very funny, yes, but he also did make Zoolander. That, alone, costs many points. I gave this show a chance, and found myself enjoying it more than I usually enjoy sketch-shows. When this show was good, it was really good. Unfortunately, it could also be somewhat average, and while the form was definitely interesting, it also felt loose... in search of a voice. Sadly, it was cut short, and never found it. The team is magnificent... Andy, Ben, Janeane, Bob and John are all fine comedians, and they work together well. The acting on the show ranges some. The material can be quite good, but some gags go on for too long, and more often than not, the crew would keep using the same characters or setting for several jokes, where only the first one worked well(one example being Stiller as the ""Latin lover"" singer). I would have to say that the movie parodies were the shows high point; with faux trailers, current(at that time) Hollywood productions were made fun of. Ben's Bruce Willis is spot-on, and his Tom Cruise isn't bad at all. The commercial spoofs tend to be fun. Some of the repeated gags also work remarkably well; the prime example being the ""Cops"" bit, where they set the well-known show in various older times. The guest stars were occasionally fun, but often(as much of the material of early episodes) simply helped to convey Stiller's brand of self-irony(bordering on self-deprecation). This show wasn't always funny, but it was seldom annoying, and usually watchable. One final thought; Dennis Miller appeared in one of the last episodes, and he(as he does tend to be difficult to silence) spoke his mind on what would help the show... half-way through it, it cuts away, and he doesn't appear again on the show. The irony of this notwithstanding, several of the points he brings up are valid. One would wonder if(given that all the material is scripted, in spite of the way in which it is presented would lead one to assume that it was not) this was Stiller(or the team)'s way of acknowledging the show's shortcomings, as well as completely and utterly disregard them. A sort of semi-silent protest... sadly, the show was axed mere episodes later. I recommend this to any fan of sketch and spoof comedy, as well as any fan of one or more of the comedians. 7/10",/review/rw5063568/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2007,Sylviastel,10," 13 Episodes Weren't Enough!
","The Ben Stiller Show proved that good comedy exists out there. Unfortunately, Fox never gave the show a chance and it was cancelled after only airing twelve episodes. In fact, the show earned an Emmy award in the following year. The show is brilliant satire of television and modern culture of the early 1990s. I love Melrose Heights 902102104 etc. which fuses the shows of Melrose Place, Beverly Hills 90210, and the Heights (which was shortly canceled) all into one. I love Janeane Garofalo who was in her element whether playing wife to a sock puppet named Skank, a prim and proper telephone operator, or spoofing Shannen Doherty. Andy Dick is also memorable as is the show's star Ben Stiller who is on the verge of stardom. I love the pilot episode where they spoof the group of U2 and Bono is singing for a cereal and at a Long Island Bar Mitzvah. The fact that they got the same manager from the Partridge Family is genius as is Paul Dooley who shows. They spoof Monkees with the Grungies in Seattle, Washington. I love the DVD and I wish there was more of Ben Stiller Show to go around.",/review/rw5063568/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2004,horsehead77,," Not Very Funny
","I recently saw this set reviewed in rolling stone, and according to them it was the 'smartest pop culture parody show ever'. To me however it was a laughless, dated bore. The problem does not sit with the actors (all of whom do a good job) but with the writing and directing. Practically every skit falls flat, punch lines don't come where they should and after a while every skit seems identical. Several of the recurring skits (e.g. 'skank' and 'bruce springsteen') are painfully unfunny the first time, let alone the third time. Over all, this show is only worth a watch if you are a fan of obscure TV and perhaps old Gen-X pop culture.",/review/rw5063568/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2011,thisidisnotavailable19,," Gene Garafuello
","Seems like everyone who was a part of this show is better than this show. I don't think it lives up to it's reputation, though it had funny moments(the Manson sketch is good enough it could have been on Mr. Show) but it was surprisingly bad for how talented every person working on it was.",/review/rw5063568/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2000,mmcgille,," Pure Genius
","Ben Stiller is the funniest man in all of TV/Movies. This show was so clever and so witty that it puts all other sketch-comedy shows to shame. His ""Amish COPS"" and ""Advantage: Agassi"" were particularly hysterical skits. Like many other fans, I am disappointed that it was cancelled so quickly. I would give ANYTHING to have Stiller's show back. It was easily the best show of all time.",/review/rw5063568/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2004,guyfromjerzee,," More intelligent than the average TV comedy, yet it doesn't quite work
","I've always liked Ben Stiller and heard good things about this show, so I decided to purchase the DVD containing all its 13 episodes. I wasn't too impressed. Unlike most comedies on TV, the show's writing is pretty intelligent. It takes sharp jabs at teen dramas, like ""Beverly Hills 90210"" and ""Melrose Place,"" and other elements of pop culture in the early 90's. Maybe one of the reasons why the gags aren't that funny is because we're no longer living in the early 90's. Even if you recall the elements of pop culture the show parodies, it's still not as funny. Plus, the jokes are quite dry, as opposed to the broad humor we usually see in sketch comedies. The cast of performers is talented. Aside from Stiller, there's Andy Dick, Janeane Garofolo and Bob Odenkirk. The celebrity guests are also amusing. The show has reached a cult following, and it's not a terrible show by any means, but it didn't make me laugh a whole lot. The only sketch that had me dying with laughter is the one with the No, No, No Guy. If anyone has seen ""Starsky and Hutch"" with Stiller, this sketch is where he originates his great ""Do it"" line. Sometimes I put on the disc just to see that sketch, because it's sooo funny. And there are a few sketches that aren't even trying to be funny, like the mock sitcom ""Skank."" Every joke is supposed to contain an element of truth, and I don't see what's truthful about a sitcom about a sock puppet. (6 out of 10)",/review/rw5063568/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2005,MovieAddict2016,," Some great skits in an underrated variety show
","Before Ben Stiller hit the big leagues in box office successes like ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""Meet the Parents,"" he was a struggling comedian trying to represent his comedic persona on the small box - he took a year on ""Saturday Night Live"" but it was his original variety show, ""The Ben Stiller Show,"" that truly portrayed his sense of humor.",/review/rw5063568/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2010,D_Burke,8," A Decent Sketch Comedy Show That Still Has a Definitive Freshness To It
","Before Fox became the #1 most watched network with shows like ""American Idol"" and ""Glee"", it was best known for offbeat shows, especially comedies, that came and went. Although shows like ""Married With Children"" and ""The Simpsons"" went on to become among the longest-running sitcoms of all time (With ""The Simpsons"" recently taking the #1 spot in that category), countless other shows on Fox got the ax early, thereby establishing Fox as a second-rate network for nearly 20 years.",/review/rw5063568/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2004,goose749,," Has its moments
","This seems, at times, to be the work of complete amateur. There are only a couple of consistently humorous episodes. This show is a mix of bad ideas, good ideas played out poorly, and the occasional gem. I definitely think they could have rid the show of the guest host segment (apologies to Colin Quinn). The DVD is worth it, if only for the odd sketches like Andy Dick disarming a bomb, Melrose Heights, and Oliver Stoneland. Still my favorite: Counting with Bruce.",/review/rw5063568/?ref_=tt_urv

I taped all 13 episodes when they were aired on Comedy Central recently. After watching maybe 4 of them, I seriously contemplated burning the cassette.

","This show was excellent. Great actors, funny skits, good writing. The problem?? Most of the humour required a brain and some inteligence. Combine that with the 7pm time slot on Sunday night that it was originally on and the fact that Fox totally gave up on it and you have a total cancellation misjustice.  The skits were hilarious, The U2 parody, the video diary (""I ate today""), Legends of Springsteen and the Tonight show tryouts were all phenomenally funny.

","Ben Stiller had something going for him here. He had pretty good cast members like Janeane Garafolo, a great actress in comedy movies, Bob Odenkirk, future host of Mr. Show with Bob and David along with David Cross and Andy Dick back when he used to be funny. Now hes just weird and completely unfunny. Ben Stiller was okay himself. I'm not very familiar with John F. O'Donohue's work so I can't really say much about him. I think David Cross should have been a cast member. He was already the top writer on the show. This show should have lasted a little longer then it did. I don't know why it did. It was on Fox though and they don't give anything a chance. I'm surprised it wasn't more like SNL seeing it had two SNL patrons on it (Ben before the show and Janeane after). The show was more like Mr. Show with Bob and David probably being Bob Odenkirk and David Cross both did work on the show. RIP The Ben Stiller Show.",/review/rw5063568/?ref_=tt_urv

If you can get past the Ben Stiller injecting himself in every single sketch (well it is his show) there are a lot of clever sketches. Almost never do they drag on, fall flat or come across as un-funny, and the supporting cast (Andy Dick, Garofalo - is there another?, and Pre-Saul Goodman, Bob Odenkirk) are very good in this show.",/review/rw5063568/?ref_=tt_urv
