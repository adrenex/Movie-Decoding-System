27 February 2018,Chanandler-Bong,6," Good, but a disappointing ending and questions unasnwered
","First off, the positives. The acting was great; All actors in this TV series were brilliant in their parts.There's been criticisim on the woman who played KJ, saying she was wooden and a bit blank. But I think that's her character. She didn't show emotion on her face. because not everyone does.The series itself was gripping and I watched it over three days (trying to stop myself from binging it too quickly). It was an emotional series that does make you feel. It does bring to light some political issues going on in America at the moment. 
However, this political view it took seemed far fetched in some ways. For starters, the sentence in the end. I cannot see that with the evidence presented, that he would have only gotten one year for it. Especially when they said the minimum for an automobile fatality was minimum 5 years. I cannot see only one year being given. I imagine the directors aim of this sentence was to show the injustice against black members of the community and how white people often get off lighter (and this of course does happen in the real world) however, I cannot see how a judge would give such a light sentence regardless of his colour. 
Anyway, getting away from that. The plot holes. One outstanding plot problem for me was Nadine's death. A witness who turns up dead the night before her testimony raises tons of questions and the fact that it's just dismissed because she had a previous drug record is ridiculous and wouldn't happen. When she died I imagine she fought having the needle pushed into her arm, which would leave bruising. An ME examiner would see that, So why this doesn't come up, I don't understand. Why there was no investigation into it, I don't know. They didn't even follow it up, a witness saw it. (#justiceforNadine) 
Aside from that, the ending just left me with more questions and to be honest just feeling frustrated with a TV series I had emotionally invested myself in. So many unanswered questons.",/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2018,julesfdelorme,10," You have to See Seven SEconds
","We say, I say, again and again that we are in a Golden Age of Television. 
We say it and I say it because it is very true. 
Television shows, spurred on by streaming apps and audience expectation being raised higher and higher, have become as good and often better than anything that film can offer. 
The problem for shows and audiences alike however is that so many superb shows can get lost in the shuffle and even, as we saw so recently with Damnation and Dirk Gently, get cancelled long before they should be.
Hopefully Seven Seconds does not fall into the latter category.
Created, and largely written by Veena Sud, best known for her work on The Killing, (She's also from Toronto. I need to mention this because I too live in Toronto and because it is so nice to see a Canadian Woman, particularly one from so close to home, finding such success.) Seven Seconds is better than just good.
It's great. 
Sud does a masterful job of writing and the shows itself is so layered with thought and imagery that I just had to go back and watch it again right away, something I have only done once, maybe twice before.
On the surface Seven Seconds is a very intense and dark story about a young white cop who hits a black boy and then, along with three other cops who he barely knows on a narcotic squad that he has just joined, seeks to cover it up. 
On the surface Seven Seconds is a contemplation of race relations and the police.
But it is so much more than just that. 
Seven Seconds is a deep and profound psychological and social study. It is a show that questions how well we really know each other, and how easily that we can assume that we know each other. It is a study of repentance and sorrow. It is a quest to see the humanity that underlies the surface in each and everyone of us. 
Yes, it's another cop show.
And, taken on that level, it is a damned good cop show.
Yes, it is a story about crime and punishment, or lack of thereof.
Taken on just that level, it is a superb presentation of the impact of crime and on each every person that crime touches.
Yes, it is dark and moody drama.
Taken on just that level, Seven Seconds' superb writing and exquisite acting stands up with the best drama. Each and every actor is so perfect. Each and every bit of dialogue is so dead on. Each and every scene evokes and rips at your emotions so terribly and so beautifully.
Seven Seconds is simply and utterly perfect at what it does in that very rare way that shows like Rectify or NYPD Blue have been able to be.
Watch Seven Seconds.
And then watch Seven Seconds again to see how well symbols are used to create depth, how layered and complex this show is underneath what seems like a pretty straight forward exterior. 
Because that is exactly what Seven Seconds really turns out to be about.
What we see on the surface does not tell us what lies hidden beneath.
But even on the surface Seven Seconds is a superb show.
Don't let it get lost.
Don't wait until it's been cancelled to find out how good this show is.
Enjoy all your other favourite shows too.
But, for your own sake, make sure you don't lose sight of Seven Seconds.",/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2018,iNickR,," Powerful. Moving. Painful.
","Seven Seconds centers on a Jersey City PD narcotics team, and their possible cover-up of the hit and run of a black teenage boy. The team is headed by Sgt. Mike DiAngelo (a chilling David Lyons), resilient and respected among his team, and officers within the department. Mike, who has no children of his own, takes young, and mostly na√Øve, officers under his wing and shows them the ropes with some tough-love and conditioning. Think Denzel Washington's character in Training Day and you'll get a really good idea of Mike DiAngelo's personality.",/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2018,nicktatta,8," Sensitive, dark, authentic and mostly well crafted
","Any review less than a 6 is nonsense, this show is well done and deserves to be watched. We're there a few plot holes and semi unbelievable parts, yes. Was 90% of the show gritty and realistic, yes. It tackled revelant cultural topics while entertaining us, especially the last 4 episodes as the pace quickened and the characters grew more desperate. Watch it, can't imagine you being disappointed.",/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2018,purrlgurrl,7," About four episodes too long.
","This story arc would have been better served if it transpired over a tighter six episodes. In so many episodes, the story is allowed to wander. The side roads are interesting (and contain some of the very best acting, especially from Regina King and Russell Hornsby), but they distract from the main story line.",/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2018,NoNameBigBoy,10," Great show, heavy, painful
","Great show with amazing actors. Usually I like to single out faves but honestly there isn't a bad performance here. But like some of the other reviews mention it's heavy, painful. A powerful look at personal and institutional racism in USA",/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2018,mr-51468,9," If you liked ""The Night Of""
","If you watch a lot of good television, you will recognize this as one of the best. Intensely touches on the issue of race, relationships, and death. Heart-wrenching. Phenomenal, and most importantly believable acting. The episodes are sort of like a novel, you don't want to put them down.",/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2018,stevesmith-80860,8," Pleasantly surprised, 7.75/10 Stars
","Based off the synopsis I didn't think I was going to like this show. I thought this show was going to be more social justice activism. I ended up really liking this show. I think the show did a really good job of giving a nuanced perspective of very complex issues, they did not try to dumb down the messaging to good and evil like some other shows and movies do. The show did a really good job of presenting all sides and letting the viewer come to their own conclusions. The show does not perceive to tell you what is right and wrong and what to think, they leave that up to the viewer to decide for themselves. The acting in this so was superb, especially Regina King, Russell Hornsby, and Michael Mosley. The dialogue was good but some of the New York accents were a little over the top, nothing too bad though. The story was good. The more episodes I watched the better the show got.

13 June 2019,danielcereto,10," Amazing
","I do not understand the low ratings. This show is simply amazing. A truly realistic masterpiece. Pretty good story line, great performances and a solid script. If you like shows like The Night of, this one is for you.",/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2021,adxpitz,8," Great Masterpiece, Dumb Ending
",I hate the concept of this payoff which pulled the value of the show a good five notch down to 5/10 but I'm still gonna give it 8/10.,/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2020,cjonesas,9," A touching story, well painted.

","This is a great series, very well played, but I think Netflix owes the audience a second season.",/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2018,savagejj,8," Great drama but ending was let down
","Fantastic series with a great cast. David Lyon was brilliant in his role as leader of the ""team"" and would terrify anyone coming across him. Great actor. Unfortunately a great story line was ruined by a rushed ending and a couple serious flaws in the plot. Nardine's death warranted further investigation esp as she was the key witness and died the day before the trial. Also the wife whispered in the defendent's ear before he took the stand. Assume he learned that his fellow officers tried to have him murdered, and he still lied and did not involve them. Other than those couple things and KJ's ridiculous summing up to the jury, I enjoyed the show.",/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv

21 November 2020,Calicodreamin,7," Slow, but good
","Undeniable that the storyline is slow going throughout the series. However, the characters are well developed, the acting is excellent, and the storyline is captivating.",/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2019,punch_p,8," Strong characters fuel familiar but compelling crime drama.
",Stands out as a great crime drama that at the same time reflects the racial divides in the country as only a mournful show about a blood stain at the foot of the Statue of Liberty can be.,/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2018,saskia520,2," What a waste of time and good actors.
","The premise was good but the execution horrible. I don't even know where to start. Regina King is a good actor it's too bad her talent was wasted. Her character looked shocked that it wasn't acceptable to knock on a cops door night after night begging him to confess to killing her son. Or that a lawyer wasn't going to find out that her son had been arrested for weed. The DA looked completely unprepared for court. Her partner punches one of the dirty cops in the courthouse with only about a million witnesses in front of them. The husband says he'll do well on the witness stand but then he folds. The judge was completely pro law enforcement to the point of ignoring the law and being rude to the DA. The hot headed cop allowed the one good witness, Nadine, to be kidnapped by the dirty cops. This whole story is ridiculous. I wasted a big chunk of time, in fact, I'm on Episode 9 and I'm not going to finish the series. I feel insulted.",/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2018,ikanboy,7," Great energy but the cript is week and the plot holes deep.
","If you want a story that follows life's logic then this is not for you. If you want one with ludicrously stereotyped characters, a plot that is jammed through reality to game us into viewing an alternate universe of bad cops, bad lawyers, and manipulated plot lines then enjoy. The writers hate the judicial system enough to concoct a dystopian morass of bad actors that is so corrupt and tone deaf to reason whose sole purpose is to stir up one's Id (as in Freud) into gleeful wrath. But it is highly entertaining and mesmerizing in it's insistence in making the viewer a slave to over acting and over plotting.",/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2018,polsixe,6," Grim Story
","Tough story set in Jersey City with locals, city cops and lawyers. The poor folk have a tough time and the deck is seemingly stacked, but they all try to do right, even the drug lord is nicknamed ""Messiah"" and seems far too noble. Cops are depicted as Thin Blue Line thugs, their actions go from bad to worse to even worse. KJ the Prosecutor is trapped between worlds. A crime procedural, this one is a 10 episode arc from crime to verdict, but could have used a bit more cribbing from L&O or Grisham for the courtroom scenes. Draws you in, but too long with too many holes in the story.",/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2020,daviddunn-90653,10," Top Notch Drama
","This is an enthralling drama. It is a very dark subject that calls for acting of a high calibre. There is not one bad performance here,and this story grips you from start to finish.",/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2018,meucicat,6," Could have been better . . .
","I binge watched the show and although I appreciate the message it appeared to be sending, there were too many things that affected the credibility of the show and therefore my enjoyment of it. First of all, as one familiar with the criminal justice system, there were too many times proper procedures were not followed, or ignored. For example, if the DA has the key witness for grand jury testimony, one who your entire case rests on, you guard against any possible event that will prevent the witness from testifying. Take Naomi. To have her in a youth center holding, even though ordered by child protective services, is absurd. You get a protection order from the grand jury and have her under lock and key until she testifies. Another bothersome detail was that it was concluded that she died of a self-induced heroin overdose, but later, Fish references one of the accused cops having scratch marks on his arms. If you suspect that, you get DNA samples from Naomi's fingernails to indicate that it might have been a forced overdose which raises the question of foul play by the dirty cops who would benefit from her ""going away"". There were just too many forced plot twists to mention that harmed the prosecution that could have been avoided. And finally, the trial was unrealistic from a legal standpoint. As an attorney, I was objecting on every question and found most of the trial scenes to be nearly laughable. I know it's necessary to try to condense a trial to a couple of episodes, but a trial of that magnitude and community importance would have lasted weeks, if not months. It also struck me that there was a similarity in some scenes that seemed to be taken right out of ""The Wire"", which in my mind was the most realistic depiction of urban struggle between the street drug life versus the police/legal/political machine.",/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2018,michaelsoberick,4," What is This Show?
","First I usually love and enjoy the Netflix originals, which usually have great acting. The acting here was just fine and on par with most Netflix originals, however the premise of the show as just off. What was this show about? Is it a racial series? Is it about bad cops? We know from watching the first 5 minutes that it isn't a mystery with some surprise twist. Is it a courtroom drama? ",/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2021,Headturner1,7," And a half
","I watched a few episodes of this about a year ago and came back and finished it the other night. It's a well done series. The acting is good ( didn't like King tho) . I feel it could have been condensed down to 6 or 7 episodes I mean the mother found him 3 episodes before they did and even then they thought it could be the cousin?!? I think I stopped watching back then because SPOILERS:
I knew they were going to go take it in to ridiculous, suspend all belief territory. Like it wasn't unbelievable enough that the whole narcotics unit involved themselves what became a homicide for a new rookie kid. Then they go from that to planned murder 1?!? Also the court case was unbelievable . I've never heard of death by auto? Vehicular manslaughter. the others were just as culpable. Oh and they were never read their rights, processed etc. The wife and cousin perverted the course of justice and didn't get charged with anything, Enough of that. The lead detective ( can't remember his name/ bully) reminds me of a young Michael Rooker( I didn't know he was a Ozzy) and I've seen Beau Knapp in things were he was a better actor 9 not that he was bad) I think all the acting was good ( on a note I mistook Regina King as the prosecutor ) I infact loved Regina( the mother's) character and I especially like Nadia the actress who played Nadine. I watch mostly UK shows like this but this is a very well done American crime/drama. And has a lot of UK actors in it. Give it a go.",/review/rw6547439/?ref_=tt_urv
