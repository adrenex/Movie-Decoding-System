16 September 2020,Azanspy,8," I did not expect this.
","Wow. I thought I was in for something else. I didn't think this movie would be in such a high level on artistic grounds. Great story and the director shot with a correct pace which would not bore us. The casting was excellent and all did great. The music is other impressive thing in this movie. I'm happy that Netflix is delivering some content driven good movies nowadays. Overall, I recommend this movie because it's crazy and worth your time.",/review/rw6161726/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2021,classicsoncall,9," ""It is our delusions that lead us to sin.""
","This is a film in which the connections among multiple characters isn't fully revealed until late in the movie. There are also a number of people who you key in on as principal players who suddenly drop out of the picture, though for obvious reasons as it turns out. As such, you may have to concentrate just a bit more on what's going on than in your average story with a linear chronology, as a handful of flashbacks are utilized to provide background detail that becomes important later on. For some viewers the slow burn nature of the picture may prove daunting, and it's dark themes may not resonate with the timid, but for those who stick with it, you'll be treated to a compelling drama of a young man who's forced to straddle the line between good and evil in an often unsuccessful attempt to protect the ones he loves. Despicable characters abound in the picture, none more so than the wicked preacher Preston Teagardin (Robert Pattinson), although his forerunner Roy Laferty (Harry Melling) I would consider a close second. By the time this film is over, you'll come to agree with the ill fated Sheriff Lee Bodecker (Sebastian Stan), who states to a young Arvin Russell in a critical flashback scene - ""Some people were born just so they could be buried..."". Turns out, there's a lot of that going on.",/review/rw6161726/?ref_=tt_urv

6 October 2020,xxforkliftermattxx,9," Put me down as deeply disturbed
","The Devil All the Time is a slow burn, thriller and melodrama with outstanding acting, exceptional editing, and precise cinematography. I love the focus on the theme of evil disguised as good. The film focuses on people who are thinking they are doing good under the guise of religion, God, and divine right instead of the harsh reality that they are terrible people committing terrible atrocities. Unfortunately, this is true to life. Obviously, this isn't saying all religious people are evil. It's more so that people are using religion as an excuse to commit crimes. The performances are all really good, and provide a look into the minds of sick, vile humans. The film is deeply disturbing because of how true to life it is and how it focuses on real life themes. It's extremely well crafted, and I love how it's presented, using voice over narration to dictate the flow of the film. The plot is a little convoluted, and the story could've been more thought out. Get ready for a slow descent into disturbing madness. This is one for the ages.",/review/rw6161726/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2020,Prasina_sa_Marsa,8," It's not for everyone, but great acting and a good story
","From the start, you realize it will be a long movie, with already being more than two hours long. It's a slow-burn movie, with a great story, great acting from actors that we love for their roles in other movies. Here we see they can be more, they took the risk and made something great and worth watching. Netflix as usual gives as every month a new movie to talk about, but this one we will remember for a while.",/review/rw6161726/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2020,WhatcanyaDo,8," Another Good Movie from Netflix
","Mean, cruel, and unflinching, Devil All the Time is indeed a highly depressing movie. It's also one I couldn't look away from. It's full of misery, loss, and irredeemable characters placed against a southern gothic background. Tom Holland's portrayal of a good man whose actions send him on a cascade of increasingly worsening situations is at the heart of this well-made flick. Good pick for an evening's entertainment if you're a Netflix subscriber.",/review/rw6161726/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2020,lukebohn,10," We need more movies like this!
","I will make this very quick. This movie is a breath of fresh air for Netflix originals. This acting is superb, everyone brings their A game. The story is dark, but trust me it's not as dark as people say. If you have ever seen ""The Road"", that is very dark. This is just kinda f'd up. The story is complex but easy to follow, and it just get's you invested. Also a very good script with some lines that I will remember for awhile. The cinematography is very good too. Honestly, nothing really bothered me or stood out as bad. A very good experience, and I would recommend.",/review/rw6161726/?ref_=tt_urv

","The story spans from WWII to Vietnam War dealing with deaths in religious rural America. Willard Russell (Bill Skarsgård) returns home from WWII in the Pacific after suffering from trauma. He marries waitress Charlotte (Haley Bennett) and together they have son Arvin. Arvin (Tom Holland) would become an orphan. He moves in with his grandparents who have adopted Lenora Laferty.

16 September 2020,joshbarton15,9," Netflix with yet another film for the best of 2020 pile.
","So there's this new film on Netflix where Spider-Man, Batman and the Winter Soldier make up only a few of the oddball characters in the bleak and unforgiving crime thriller, The Devil All the Time, from Antonio Campos. Now, I'm going to stop right there and tell you that is a ridiculous way to approach this film yet it seems some just aren't ready to relate the actors in this film to anything other than the superhero films they've either already graced or about to. The three respective actors are only a small part of an ensemble cast that may just be the most imipressive of the year.",/review/rw6161726/?ref_=tt_urv

23 September 2020,henriquemmd,8," Such a good movie!
","António Campos should be really proud of this one. Usually I don't care for a narrator during this movie but when is Pollock telling the story everything gets better. Pollock gives an excellent narrative full of opinions and insults for each character. The story is well written, even with the cross between storylines witch is always difficult to do. The cast is superb! Everyone one is so memorable. My surprise was Herry Melling! He was great in every scene speacialy the one with the spiders",/review/rw6161726/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2020,kosmasp,9," All over the place
","Well not all over, as the movie states right at the beginning, we do have a certain area that is being the center of it. Even if that area or rather the cities themselves do not exist. But that is of course for the purpose of the movie and to be as vague as possible as to people not being offended ... like if their town/village name was mentioned.",/review/rw6161726/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2020,nogodnomasters,8," Pick your time.
","This is a drama with a lot of killing. The film first focuses on Willard (Bill Skarsgård) in 1957, a WWII vet who has seen horrors. It then shifts to his son. We needed Willard to understand his son Arvin (Tom Holland). The film shifts between small towns in Ohio and West Virginia and has a subplot. It also contains third person narration that was done by someone doing a light version of Sam Elliot. Next time just get Sam Elliot and don't call any of the characters ""dude.""",/review/rw6161726/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," As interesting and well-made as it is long and clumsy.
","'The Devil All The Time (2020)' is an incredibly uneven experience. At times, it's atmospheric and compelling; at others, it's dull and undisciplined. Essentially, it follows a few different story strands featuring characters who eventually cross each other's paths in relatively intricate ways. It also jumps back and forth between a couple of time periods to provide backstories for some of its major players, focusing on their parents in order to give you a better understanding of what makes them tick. The picture deals with things such as faith, sin, delusion, fate and family, positing that violence always begets violence but sometimes can't be helped anyway. Occasionally, it's interesting and well-conceived, but it's just as often uninspired and clumsy. This is frustrating, to say the least. There's persistent narration (from the source novel's own author) that initially seems like a way to add flavour and condense the flick's lengthy set-up (seriously, it's about an hour long) but eventually evolves into a way for it to simply tell us what its characters are thinking. It isn't awful and can sometimes be rather atmospheric, but it feels somewhat intrusive and, frankly, unnecessary. Sometimes, it's almost like the movie is supplementing the narration rather than the other way around. Another issue is that the film feels as though it lacks a solid through-line. Even its individual stories seem like a series of isolated events until they suddenly start to come together towards its conclusion. It's in its final movement that the affair finds its most success, as its stories start to satisfyingly intertwine and a strong sense of foreboding creeps in. You're never quite sure how things are going to end up, which makes for a fairly tense finale. Overall, the film is a mixed bag. It's atmospheric, well-made and often enjoyable. It's also long, unfocused and relentlessly grim. It could have done with a bit of tightening up, to be honest. However, the further away you get from it, the more fondly you remember the experience. Perhaps that's primarily because it has such a solid third act. It leaves a stronger impression in retrospect than it does in the moment. In the end, it's a good movie that's dampened somewhat by its flaws. 6/10",/review/rw6161726/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2020,lewishart,9," Tom Holland takes the cake!
","When i first saw Tom Holland he was a great addition to spiderman. But my god he had much more to give and this film just shows it. We know bill skarsgard is an amazing acting anyway but also robert pattinson gives a brilliant performance.
Back to Tom Holland. He is incredible in this. I never thought he'd go beyond marvel and into 18+ films. He suits it so much more and that lad is TALENTED! His performance is impeccable.

19 September 2020,trinaboice,8," Creepy story that sticks with you with an excellent cast
","IN A NUTSHELL:
Netflix presents a new film directed by Antonio Campos based on the gothic crime novel also called The Devil All the Time. What's cool is that the movie is narrated by Donald Ray Pollock, the author of the book! Knockemstiff is a town featured in the movie that you'd swear was a made-up name, but it""s a real place where Pollack grew up. The movie is produced by Jake Gyllenhaal, which makes sense because the characters sort of feel like characters Jake has played in some of his former movies. Speaking of the cast, that's why you want to watch this movie. It's like attending an acting class. That being said, it's a bleak and gruesome movie that features the ugliness of twisted people. This is NOT a family-friendly film, nor one you want to watch with your grandma.",/review/rw6161726/?ref_=tt_urv

","Tom Holland, the ultimate star and protagonist of the movie, appears only after the first 45 minutes. This 140-minute movie should have been a mini-series (someone may still make one, for all I know). As well, the brilliant support Robert Pattison appears only after Holland does. But then, the 45 minutes of ""prelude"" is comprised of no less than 3 separate stories, each good enough to become a separate movie. They are, of course, inter-connected in one way or another.",/review/rw6161726/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's great to see a film written, without both eyes on the bottom line. An excellent script, well paced by an ensemble cast who all deliver their A game. Like any great film, each viewer may take a different message. I leave it to you to decide what it is but any film that makes you think after the credits roll has done its job.
