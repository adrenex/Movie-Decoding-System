7 April 2015,brchthethird,7," Clichéd, pulpy source material elevated by fine filmmaking and performances
","As spotty as Tony Scott's filmography was, it's easy to forget how good he could be. This is my first time seeing REVENGE and I must say that I was surprised by how emotionally involving and artfully directed it was, despite relying on a number of genre clichés. Kevin Costner plays Michael ""Jay"" Cochran, a 12-year Navy veteran who has just left the service and goes to see his friend, Tiburon Mendez (Anthony Quinn), in Mexico. While there, he ends up falling in love with Tibey's (as his friends call him) beautiful, young wife Miryea (Madeleine Stowe). When Tibey finds out about this, leaves Jay for dead and throws Miryea away in a whorehouse. The remainder of the film is Jay going back to rescue Miryea. Hopefully I haven't given too much away, but the film is 25 years old and there has to be a statute of limitations on spoilers, even if they're small. Since I liked more than I disliked, I'll just get the negative stuff out of the way first. I mentioned earlier that this film relies on genre clichés. One such example, and very key to establishing the central character relationship is the history shared by Tibey and Jay. Apparently, they were hunting buddies and Jay saved Tibey's life one time, so now Tibey is in debt to Jay. That's something that's been done to death in countless films before and since, but it wouldn't be such an issue if that wasn't the extent of it. It was just hard for me to buy that a Navy pilot would have it in so good with a Mexican power broker/kingpin. I also thought the romance that develops between Jay and Miryea was rather cliché, even if it was well-performed. And to be fair, this movie has some great performances in it. Kevin Costner was his usual likable self, and veteran actor Anthony Quinn was great as his world-weary foil. Madeleine Stowe did fine, but isn't given much to do besides be the damsel in distress once confined to the whorehouse. Now, on to the positives (the rest). This is probably one of Tony Scott's best-directed films, and came a decade or so before he started using his much ripped-off MTV shooting style. There were some really artful shots, e.g., a fire being reflected in sunglasses or beautiful shots of the Mexican terrain. Even the sex scenes were shot well. I also really liked the score, which struck a fine balance between melancholy and tension. But most of all, and despite the clichéd elements, the characters were well written and developed, and the performances really elevated the rather pulpy source material. Overall, REVENGE is an artful, occasionally thoughtful action thriller that probably deserves more attention than it got/currently gets. It might have a shaky dramatic foundation, but it's definitely worth seeing for what's built around and on top of it.",/review/rw3530228/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2016,PredragReviews,8," ""I have already fathered dozens of children!""
","A story about uncontrollable passion and desire that forces two people to act upon impulses they know they should put aside but they cannot control their true feelings, and act with reckless abandon. Madelaine Stowe is the lovely lady in an unfulfilling marriage to Tibby Mendez (Anthony Quinn) that Jay, Costner's character, almost immediately falls in love with. Tibby belongs to the Mexican underworld, probably a drug king-pin, and befriends Jay who saved Tibby's life in a hunting accident. When Tibby invites Jay to spend a few weeks at his estate in Mexico, he never imagined Jay would attempt to steal his lovely young wife.",/review/rw3530228/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2009,RedRoadster,7," Atmospheric and well acted, a bit of a sleeper.
","Kevin Costner in his early days managed to convey a rawness to his characters that was seldom seen after he made ""Dances with Wolves"" and became a successful producer. Films such as ""No Way Out"" (1987), ""Bull Durham"" (1988) and of course ""Revenge"" (1990) showed him when he was trying to establish his career and you could feel the actor at work rather than the movie maker.",/review/rw3530228/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2013,seymourblack-1,7," Betrayal, Retribution & Tragedy
","""Revenge"" is based on a novella by Jim Harrison who together with Jeffrey Alan Fiskin also wrote the screenplay. The plot is extremely simple and straight forward and doesn't contain any real twists or surprises but does gain some traction by the nature and intensity of the circumstances that the characters confront.",/review/rw3530228/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2004,oneflewovertheapocalypse,," Shockingly Great Film
","It has been nearly ten years since I last saw Revenge but I always have this fond memory of how much it had an impact on me as it was a very courageous project for Kevin Costner at that time. It started off like this Top Gun rip off then turned into this beautiful tale of love, passion and betrayal. Never have a seen a love story with so much chemistry and have an ending which Hollywood would never dream of now compared to back then.",/review/rw3530228/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2004,flickershows,6," Serve That Dish Cold, Kev
","Tony Scott loves his so-called good guys to be amoral anti-heroes. The more ruthless they are, the better (after they've taken a pounding from the bad guy first, natch). And whenever possible, he likes Mexico to be in the mix. With that set-up, I could be describing 'Man On Fire', 'True Romance', or 1990's 'Revenge'. Since he unofficially remade 'Revenge' as 'Man On Fire' earlier this year, I should just call up that review and replace Denzel Washington's name with Kevin Costner's. Even though I'm seeing them out of order, the 14-year-old flick is better. Scott even shows more grown-up sensibilities than he usually does and directs his actors through believable love scenes. I don't think he's been so unabashedly romantic since this period in the early '90s.",/review/rw3530228/?ref_=tt_urv

12 March 2000,billy-7,7," Highly underrated
","I'd avoided this film for years, despite being a huge Costner fan, because people had described it as nearly unwatchable.  On the advice of someone on the internet, I gave it a shot, and what a surprise! Although it'll never be one of my favorite films, it's certainly worthwhile, a highly engrossing (albeit graphically gory) trip through a wide and shifting range of emotions.  Quinn gives his best performance since ""Zorba,"" and Costner and Stowe are extremely good. The photography is extraordinary, and Mexican music has seldom been used so effectively.  I'd recommend it to anyone with a strong stomach.  The love scenes, by the way, are romantic AND sexy, a rare combination.",/review/rw3530228/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2005,ereinion,7," Better than many think
","This is a movie that I always enjoy watching, no matter how many times I've seen it previously. Kevin Costner stars in what is one of his better roles as the veteran pilot J. Cochran who retires from his job in the navy and goes to Mexico to visit his old friend Tiburon ""Tibey"" Mendez, played excellently by Anthony Quinn in what is one of his last powerful performances. Madeleine Stowe plays Mendez' much younger wife who catches Cochran's eye from the first moment. A passionate love affair ensues, but with tragic consequences.",/review/rw3530228/?ref_=tt_urv

15 May 2002,enterthecass,7," Magnificent ending!
","Certainly the ending of this film is extremely moving and literally takes your breath away. It leaves you with a feeling that you have probably seen something better than what you actually have. Of course Tony Scott is one of the most stylish directors about ie.- 'The Hunger'(1983) which has to be one of the most stylish films about. He's also made his fair share of blockbusters ie.-'Top Gun'(1985),'Beverly Hills Cop 2'(1987),'Days of Thunder'(1989) and more recently 'Enemy of the State'(1998)- all of which took a lot of money, the profits of the first one in particular bordering on the ridiculous. And don't forget he made the little seen(in the cinema anyway) but memorable 'True Romance'(1992). So you get the feeling that here Mr.Scot was making a picture trapped in-between both worlds- that of the blockbuster and the more personal picture. The film did only average in the box office and did not really make any kind of impact on any of the performer's careers.It is beautifully filmed with lots of trademark Scott shots ie- sun beams pouring through a drawn blind and mist covering the scenery. The violence is maybe a little too graphic. Costner goes through the motions somewhat in a character who is a mix of the roles he played in 'No Way Out'(1987) and 'The Bodyguard'(1992).He does his best acting in the final quarter of the picture where he shows well executed, muted regret and sorrow.Stowe is very attractive and impressive as Miryea who for the second half of the picture is dying slowly through a drugged daze. Anthony Quinn delivers a solid display as the larger than life Mexican gangster who after delivering his vengeance on Jay and Miryea becomes a sad, secluded old man who takes no pleasure in the measures he has taken but continues to justify them.Such a role is very undemanding for a legend like Quinn.Miguel Ferrer also has an undemanding role and John Leguziamo is impressive in an early career role as an eager but almost mute gunman who aids Costner.The plot is nothing special.The only interesting point is that Quinns character's vengeance, though excessive, is justifiable. Ultimately Jay and Miryea get their just deserts in the sense that both betrayed him through their secretive adultery which seems more born out of lust than love. The love between these two is not well enough developed to justify the beautiful ending to the film. If the couples relationship had been longer and not completely based around sex you could understand the emotion between them more.The piano track used for the two lovers is very touching and forms the perfect soundtrack for the memorable ending sequence. OVERALL- I give this picture 7/10. It is raised above average by the ending. Ultimately it is worth sitting through the picture,which is overlong, and paying attention to it just for the ending which is beautifully shot, romantic, captivating and probably one of the most heartbreakingly sad moments in film history(yes its that good). Even the most stoneyhearted will be touched.",/review/rw3530228/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2016,Hollywood_Yoda,8," Watch the Directors Cut
","If you get the chance to see this film, make sure it's the directors cut. At a shorter running time, the story unfolds quicker, but it gets to the point, and makes for a better film. Tony Scott did a tremendous job directing, and the leading cast was great. Kevin Costner and Madeline Stowe make a great on screen couple.",/review/rw3530228/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2015,g-bodyl,9," Costner Unleashing Revenge!
","Revenge is actually a much better movie than I thought it would be. It was a little-known movie, but with a good cast, I thought it would be worth the pick-up. It is a very bloody, violent film with themes of redemption, in more ways than one. The movie began slow with the introduction of Costner's character, but once when his elderly Mexican politician friend enters the picture, things begin to pick up steam. In all, this is a vastly underrated action revenge flick. ",/review/rw3530228/?ref_=tt_urv

25 July 2013,mnpollio,1," The only revenge taken is on the viewer
","From the latter 1980s into the early 1990s, actor Kevin Costner seemed to lead a relatively charmed professional life, appearing in such popular films as Silverado, The Untouchables, No Way Out, Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, JFK and his Oscar-winning spectacle Dances With Wolves, before tanking and never really quite recovering from Waterworld. In the midst of this success stands a little-seen ""action"" film called Revenge, which came and went very quickly and won over neither critics nor viewers, before being forgotten in light of DWW's success later that same year.",/review/rw3530228/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2012,lost-in-limbo,8," ""Do you think my wife's beautiful?""
","Never been much of a fan of director Tony Scott's work, but the dramatic thriller ""Revenge"" starring Kevin Costner, Madeline Stone and Anthony Quinn was a pleasant surprise. Quite harrowing and brutal in its developments, where the forbidden romantic angle takes up most of the time, but because of this, the relationships have depth (loyalty is tested, betrayal comes fast and forgiveness shines through) and emotional attachment making the ending consist of lasting power. It's sweaty, intense and unforgiving where the locations are put to good use, but Scott doesn't feel the need to overpopulate it with stylised filming techniques. It's crisp, but lacking the flair and frenetic mood of recent ventures. An American ex-fighter pilot visiting an old wealthy prominent friend in Mexico begins to have an affair with his friend's wife who finds out and takes revenge on them both. The pilot is left for dead, but he survives seeking revenge against the jealous husband / friend and reunion with his lover. Strong performances by the trio; Costner, Stone and Quinn give their characters are larger than life feel. While the support are just as capable with Tomas Milan, Miguel Ferrer, John Leguizamo, James Gammon and Sally Kirkland. While quite talky and drawn out, it's rather poetic in a classic love story sense, but willing to get seedy and tragic in its torturous outcome.",/review/rw3530228/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2011,Kalamata,2," flatliner
","This movie proves that Tony Scott wasn't always a great director. One review said that this film was the basis for a much superior film (tho' not to him), Man On Fire. Seen in that light, I can say 'good on ya, Tone,' you made up for this thing with a really superior revenge flick.' It's Man On Fire that should have been called 'Revenge'. This movie starts out like it's going to be sensational, but soon it begins to drift. Then the clichés pile one upon the other until the last painful scene which was pulled almost directly from Wuthering Heights. Even to some of the camera angles! The dramatic keg that Tony was filling with gunpowder, the fuse that was going to light it, it all gets wet with scenes that look promising but never deliver. This is dramatis interruptus. Costner is very uneven and Quinn is Quinn. Madeleine Stowe looks fantastic. Overall the movie looks great. But beyond that it's a frustrating film from a director who became great.
