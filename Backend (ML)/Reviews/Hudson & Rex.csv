11 June 2022,stefano66-665-192848,8," Not bad at all
","As I wrote in title of my review this show it's not bad at all. I don't understand the reason why there are so many bad reviews. For sure it's not a masterpiece at all but as entertainment it's good enough to spend some hours watching this show. Ya it's more on teens side probably...the soundtrack, the actors etc...it's polically correct maybe a little bit too much and it's not bad at all. The characters sometimes are a little bit ""over"" and the story too. But if u wanna pure entertainment with vampires, monsters etc give it a chance without prejudice and u will not disappointed.",/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2022,spotsandstripes-72861,10," Super fun!!
","I had such a fun time watching this, it's so nice to see a cheesy show that has lesbian main characters. I hate that so many people are treating it as though it has to be a masterpiece, we deserve to have our fun supernatural romances too!! It was very wattpad-y but that was honestly my favourite thing about it. The cast is superb, the lore is interesting, not to mention the lovable characters. Netflix had better give us a renewal and not cancel it like every single other wlw show they've made.",/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2022,smalikmarch,9," Love Moderately
","I love the 2000s teen flick approach on this. No matter what people say about that, I will stand by it. It's a teen vampire flick, it's only appropriate for it to pay homage to its successors. The hunter and prey trope is amazing, the lesbian pining approach is amazing. ""It's a cliche trope"" of course it is, it's a teen flick.",/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2022,dcuevas-30596,10," Super fun!
","Great mythology, acting, romance and friendship. The cast has great chemistry and the families feel like family. Super fun and campy that remind me of 2000 shows.",/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2022,jgbjsfz,10," First time for queer romance without the hangover tropes
","This is incredible. The first time I've seen a queer girl relationship that wasn't overly sexualised to fake-hetro Katy Perry I-kissed-a-girl vibes, and overshadowed by some great coming out story. They're here, they're queer, and they've got way bigger problems to sink their teeth into. Absolute joyride to have a good monster slasher show with protagonists I can enjoy as well.",/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2022,Lexipedia_26,9," Was this corny? Yes. Was I giggling and screaming the whole time? Yes
","Ok so maybe the graphics weren't the greatest and maybe the acting was a little corny and cringe, but I'll be damned to say that I was giggling and screaming at my screen every scene that cal and jul had together and for them alone I give it a 9, I said what I said.",/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2022,nabi21,8," Fun!
","What a fun, campy show! It's not the best TV has to offer, some lame action and a few laugh out loud lines of dialogue here and there, but I am glued to my seat! Plus, the romance between the two female leads is very sweet, not to mention both are super likable and badass! It's obvious Netflix obviously didn't give this show a big budget, and compared to the other shows and movies on the platform, I really don't understand why. It's way more interesting than some of the other originals Netflix has been producing. In any case, the show worked with what it got, and it paid off. I hope the show is renewed for season 2 with a bigger budget, definitely give the show a shot!",/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2022,star_hazard,8," A dash of Buffy meeting Killing Eve but focus on romance
","First off let me just say if you're going to reiterate how this is Buffy this and that then congrats you have watched what Victoria Schwab, the author of the book this was based on, intended it to be! My expectations going in here was a lot of angst and teen drama but surprisingly missing from here. I mean there's some negatives still since they are teenagers but like it's not all ""I'm going to choose bad decisions and never thinks things through because it's all about me"" type of bs.",/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2022,bhernandez2216,10," Never forget for first love with a Vampire
","I am absolutely falling in love again, like I fell in love with the Vampire Diaries and the Originals and also of course, Teen Wolf. First Kill tells a pretty good romantic story about a vampire Hunter who fell in love with a vampire and it does bring pretty good TVD, TO, and TW vibes. Sarah Catherine Hook and Imani Lewis are the next generation for two best actress with their amazing performances, and they've brought the best lesbian romance and best hunter monster team up, they just became the next Teen Monster filmmaking icons for this show on Netflix.",/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv

",Loved this!!! Such a great storyline! Very modern day Romeo and Juliet....,/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2022,tibaabbas-63857,10," MWAH
","Amazing show!! The storyline, actors, character, just everything matches perfectly. Such a good show to watch. I expect more of this serie. Hope it gets a season 2.",/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2022,jeninabdelazimm,10," Loved ittt!!
",It's literally one of the best wlw shows/representation I've seen. And OMG the intro song took me by surprise and brought back all these childhood memories ahahahahha.,/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2022,pishpish-35267,10," I absolutely adored
","I loved the rep, i loved the cheesiness, i loved everything about it. Not every show needs to reinvent the wheel and im sick of this whole ""vampire show is tired"" it is i wont lie but for straight people ive only ever seen around 3 shows with a lesbian couple and it always end in death or tragedy. I especially love that its just love, no deeper meaning to calliope being black or anyone being lgbt, its just acknowledged and accepted by their families. Its not their gender, race, or wealth thats the problem just the situation. Im so happy that we finally got a show with a lesbian couple that act like one and dont just glance at each other from across the hall and call it representation.",/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2022,shadeah,10," Love the show first kill
","There are 155 lbgtq show on Netflix out of 1,800 TV shows on Netflix so what going on you really tell me u guys trying to get rid of this show that is crazy u guys love them straight show but not lbgtq show I see.",/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2022,katerinapapa-31291,10," Campy teen vampire show with lesbians? Yes please
",I love this show! The vibe is something between Twilight and buffy the Vampire Slayer but the main couple are lesbians which is something I've never seen before and was definitely needed to bring back the genre.,/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2022,davidgould-50411,7," Really Enjoyable. I wonder whether some of the scathing reviews have an objective?
",I admit that I haven't finished the first season yet but it's really enjoyable and very slick. My own attention span is small and I've stopped so many very highly rated series and movies due to them being slow and boring. This is really enjoyable and well done. Congratulations to all involved and good luck for renewals.,/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2022,Writing2o7,10," It's kinda good...
","Now it's real real campy... but it's a kii. Like the storyline??? Oh I'm curious, I'm intrigued. But the execution chile... I meannnnnn it's ok! I will be watching to the end tho yup yup. I'll recommend it for a good turn off your brain and just get invested in this hot mess. It's definitely something.",/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2022,carvel-63478,10," A twist on the old nice girl/mean girl tale
","We are used to a certain type of content when it comes to female relationships. Don't listen to the misogyny and the homophobia some of the people writing here obviously need to work on. This twist on the old tale of good girl/bad girl is exactly the kind of twist we need in this day and age. Instead of the two girls being rivals and one wins and the other loses, it is a love story instead. These are the kind of new stories we should be watching. Let the obvious people who will get mad at that get mad.",/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2022,wiktoriaglijer,10," Extremely overhated!
",This show is good i cant believe a show like this getting hate and based but a show like heartstopper is getting all media attention! This show is 100% times better than heartstopper and i feel like the characters have genuine personalitys rather in heartstopper it focuses mainly on main two characters. Extremely overhated show its honestly what the description sais a vampire hunter love story teo families at war except its LGBTQ+ and slightly chest but its rated 15 so what do you excpect? This show is definetely not for everyone but i dint see the need for all the hate it has received after only being out for a few hours ðŸ˜‚,/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2022,mridulchandra,8," Love the show.
","Make sure you fast forward first episode, for me that's easily one of the worst pilot ep ever.",/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2022,aamelieelizabeth,10," AMAZING SHOW!! deserves a bigger budget
","I loved this so much!!! Plot was fun and less predictable than i thought, although i dont have much experience in this genre so maybe thats why. Special effects could be better but i blame netflix for not giving this show a bigger budget. Its not a perfect show but the representation is amazing and i was fully hooked by the end!! Finale made me cry! The chemistry and acting was 10/10 on all fronts and i definitely want a season 2. The world building could be explored so much more if given the opportunity, plus i of course want to see calliette back together again! Overall, amazing show with TONS of potential. Dont mess this up netflix!",/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2022,nicholasbullock-10959,10," good so far!
",Here y'all go leaving the negative reviews before actually watching the whole series! Y'all love leaving bad reviews without even watching the whole thing first. Jesus y'all are just weird! But this is actually good so far.,/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2022,HalloweenOracle,10," Absolutely amazing!
","An interesting concept, it seems we already saw the concept of forbidden love, yet here it's showed in a refreshing angle, also a nice setting - Savannah is always nice. The dynamics and emotions between the main characters are very well shown. And Imani Lewis, just as in Hightown, delivers in a stunning manner. Keep watching people!",/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2022,isabelbovo,10," I'm In Love
","I am in love with this show. I thought it started out a little cringey, little bit cheesy, the acting was a little bit meh. But somehow after the first episode, suddenly everything just got better and better, I got hooked and binged it the whole day. The show has brilliant representation and the portrayal of lgbtq+ people was actually pretty accurate and quite funny if I'm honest. When it got down to the last episode, I had an insatiable hunger for a season 2. I thoroughly enjoyed this show. Thank you Netflix!!!",/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2022,jellajellobean,7," At first I was like yikes but then....
","At first I was like what heck is this? It looked cheap and they kept blasting random music every couple of seconds but then I get to the second episode and I am like okay...you have my attention. It sort of reminds me of an old cartoon called American Dragon Jake Long with the hunter and the ""monster"" love story. The acting is a bit meh but I have a feeling I am not their target demographic I am a wee bit older but I still enjoyed it nevertheless.",/review/rw8224646/?ref_=tt_urv
