23 December 2014,kosmasp,10," Could this be real?
","Let me start with: I don't like ""reality TV"" at all. And there is a reason you have to put """", because it is anything but real. And while this isn't real either (obviously), it is so much more fun than anything and feels more like what good reality TV could be ... if there where Vampires that is.",/review/rw3038384/?ref_=tt_urv

","A few months ago, thanks in part to a Kickstarter campaign, What We Do in the Shadows arrived in film festivals all over the world...and audiences were stunned! Why? Because it's one weird, very weird movie! ",/review/rw3038384/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2015,SnoopyStyle,8," fun unusual mockumentary
","Every few years in New Zealand, a secret society holds The Unholy Masquerade. A film crew is allowed into the lives of some vampires who are part of the secret society of supernatural beings such as witches, zombies and werewolves. Viago (Taika Waititi), Nazi vampire Deacon (Jonathan Brugh), Vladislav (Jemaine Clement) and ancient Petyr live together in a house in Wellington struggling with everyday vampire drama. Jackie is Deacon's human familiar who is frustrated with the lack of upward mobility.",/review/rw3038384/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2018,perica-43151,9," Excellent, original, fun
","This is one very amusing movie. Not taking itself too seriously, but managing to bring freshness and originality and many many new angles to the vampire genre. It is witty, it looks nice and is wholeheartedly recommended.",/review/rw3038384/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2014,punishable-by-death,9," Unrelentingly funny
","I wasn't sure about this one, I cannot remember anything about Flight of the Concords (sp?) and comedy is a sticky thing for me. I find that I laugh out loud more often during dramas, horror, thrillers etc than comedies. I thought GRAND BUDAPEST, ZERO THEOREM and THE DOUBLE were hilarious. But this surprised me... a lot.",/review/rw3038384/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2014,t-schaffrath,9," Absurdly Funny!
","I watched this movie, knowing nothing about it before, and it completely blew me away. It had me gut-busting from the very first scene throughout the entire movie. The premise of vampire flatmates is absurd, but it works great, because the movie takes its characters just serious enough for the audience to be somewhat emotionally invested in them. The chemistry between the actors is also great. But of course, the biggest strength of the movie is, that it delivers laughs on a very consistent level. Seriously, there was probably a joke every minute, that made me laugh so hard, I cried. I really don't wanna oversell this one, but I think this might be the funniest mockumentary since ""This is Spinal Tap"". If you like mockumentaries, dark comedy, vampires, or are just generally into humor, definitely go see this one. This is the funniest movie of the year so far, but I'm sure, that won't change.",/review/rw3038384/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2014,jabberwockynz,10," Brilliant
","When you very nearly spray a mouthful of drink over the person in front of you, its generally a good indicator the movie is pretty funny. The sandwich joke had me in stitches! This movie doesn't rely on just a few jokes to carry it, they maintain a subtle layer of humour throughout and then have you in stitches with some brilliant jokes. The cast in this movie are well picked, and Stu was brilliantly played by...well Stu. Taiki Waititi & Jemaine Clement really get the whole dilemma of everyday life as a vampire! Hopefully this gets picked up and the masses get a chance to enjoy this wee gem. Loved this movie and would definitely recommend it. Gave this a 10. A must see!!",/review/rw3038384/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2014,ellsideous,9," Fangtastic Fun!
","The comedy horror is so hard to get right. Then using the Vampire genre and the equally overused mockumentary style you are pushing a boulder up hill. So the mere fact that this film feels fresh and leaves me wanting more is more than a poke, yes there is more than a poke, in the right direction. Great performances by all, apparently a lot of it is improvised but the script is well versed in vampire lore and flatting mannerism, nicely produced and well paced. New Zealand seems to have a talent for comedy horror. Peter Jackson's Brain Dead is perhaps the pinnacle and this from Taika Waititi and Jermane Clement is close on it heels. Gags and gore in equal abundance with a beating heart at its center, entrails to the left. Check it out!",/review/rw3038384/?ref_=tt_urv

20 December 2014,Karl Self,9," At last, a vampire movie that doesn't suck
","I'm in the twilights of my years and no longer part of ""Generation Twilight"", so initially I wasn't so hot on a vampire mockumentary. The idea seemed good enough for maybe 30 minutes of comedy, and not for a full feature movie. But What We Do In The Shadows is brilliantly done and really buckets of fun. It rides on the great actors, but also on a wonderful script and an ingenious mix of wobbly ""porno camera"" and perfectly placed special effects. The movie addresses various aspects of being a vampire in New Zealand today:",/review/rw3038384/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2017,ianwilmoth-14058,," If you liked spinal tap or best in show
",you'll probably love this- it follows the mockumentary format excellently but ups the ante because its following a cast of actual (in the worldof the movie) vampires. (oh and some werewolves make a hilarious cameo.). But within the conceit of being a mockumentary its played totally straight. ,/review/rw3038384/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2014,mikeg-952-204749,9," Sometimes the scariest thing about being a vampire is doing the dishes
","This fly-on-the-wall mockumentary is a refreshingly silly take on a genre that desperately needed sending up - vampires. If you thought vampire movies had reached saturation point, think again, because What We Do In The Shadows manages to lend it a thankfully comical bent. Taika Waititi and Jermaine Clement lead a solid cast of Kiwi actors playing a small group of inept but lovable bloodsuckers living in a flat together in Wellington. When a freshly turned convert starts bragging about his newfound vampire status while out clubbing, things start going wrong for the troupe, who until then had only to contend with minor problems like what to wear on a night out when your wardrobe is 400 years out of fashion, and how to go clubbing when nobody will invite you in the door. Vampire gags come thick and fast and there's enough of a solid plot to keep the movie entertaining. It even gets a little bit tense in places when the flatmates start to fall out over the new convert's bad behaviour. All in this is a very funny film, with more than a few classic one-liners. A great date movie to check whether your lover-to-be can handle a little dark humour. Highly recommended.",/review/rw3038384/?ref_=tt_urv

","Pretty dang funny! Four vampires share a flat in New Zealand, and this mockumentary follows them! (Petyr was my favorite - totally old school!) The more you ""know"" about vampires, the more you'll enjoy this! And there are werewolves too - Werewolves, not Swear-Wolves! This is fun and very well made!

2 November 2017,cherold,5," mildly amusing
","I watched this for about half an hour. A mockumentary about vampire roommates is a cute idea, mixing the day-to-day challenges of shared living with vampire challenges like finding victims, and it was all kind of amusing. But I wouldn't go so far as to call it funny, and the fact that I wasn't actually laughing or feeling interested hinted to me that this wasn't the movie for me.",/review/rw3038384/?ref_=tt_urv

20 December 2014,Red_Identity,," A deliciously great time
","I hadn't heard about this until now... boy, what a treat. The ensemble cast is utterly fantastic, very devoted to every second of comedy that is juiced out of this film's content and subject. The ""vampire mockumentary"" plot is something that I don't think anyone eve dreamed of, but it's utterly devoted to making every comedy worth it and it succeeds. There are a few sore spots here and there, but overall this was a great time. Definitely something for moviegoers to seek out next year, it really does add a lot of the horror/comedy genre and I think it could be a real hit across nations. I strongly recommend it, and it has a great attitude about itself that won't turn people away.",/review/rw3038384/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2016,BA_Harrison,8," Destined for cult status.
","What We Do In The Shadows, a horror 'mockumentary' that follows a group of vampire flatmates in New Zealand as they go about their night-to-night activities, both ghoulish and mundane, does for vampires what Spinal Tap did for Heavy Metal bands: it puts its eccentric characters at the centre of some extremely outré situations, yet still shows them as real people that the viewer can identify with and care about. As with Rob Reiner's celebrated 'rockumentary', the wonderfully realised collection of likable characters, the delightfully droll sense of humour and plenty of highly quotable dialogue ensure that the film is destined for cult status.",/review/rw3038384/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2015,leonblackwood,6," You have to have a warped sense of humour to enjoy it! 6/10
","Review: I found this film quite funny at the beginning but it gets a bit ridiculous after a while. The storyline is quite original and the different characters brought different flavours to this somewhat weird and wonderful film. Its based around three vampires who live together as roommates. They have to deal with day to day life whilst getting various victims to come to there house so they can feed. One of there victims introduces them to modern life and they end up going to night clubs and exploring the Internet. The whole concept is very well put together and at such a cheap budget, they really did do a good job. It does get a big silly after a while but you have to take it with a pinch of salt because your really not supposed to take it seriously. The fact that they are blood sucking vampires who take to a very normal Nick, who doesn't really say that much through the film, made me laugh along with the servant who is dying to become a vampire. Anyway, it's a light hearted comedy about a friendship and brotherhood which has a unique, vampire twist. Watchable!",/review/rw3038384/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2015,drqshadow-reviews,6," Silly But Understuffed, This Needed a Little More Incubation
","A Flight of the Conchords mockumentary inspecting the logistics of the vampire social scene in modern-day New Zealand. I was hoping for better. It seems like it's constantly right on the verge of doing something really hilarious, but can't quite flip the switch. The landscape is ripe for this kind of a satire, too, with so much empty romanticism hovering around the fantasy genre. Most of the fun comes from picking apart the hallmarks of the bloodsucker game, exposing them for the lame parlor tricks and absurd handicaps they really are. Mystically swapping a plate of noodles for worms, for example, to the mild annoyance of the victim. Failing to enter a nightclub because the bouncer doesn't explicitly invite them in. In most films, these would be appetizers for the main entree, but in this case there's no second course. This would've made for a brilliant skit on a sketch comedy show, but it just doesn't have the depth for its own feature-length. Even a very short one.",/review/rw3038384/?ref_=tt_urv
