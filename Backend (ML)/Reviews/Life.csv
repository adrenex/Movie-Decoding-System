4 December 2022,johnnynewell,2," Bad bad bad bad bad
","This movie is an absolute nightmare compared to not only the book it is based off of also the original live action film. I have nothing nice to say about this film. This film has no sense of direction or personality and it seems like it came out of someone's ass. I don't feeling the bonding of these characters like I do in both the boo and the original movie therefore when the ""climax"" happens where the boys get into a fight I don't feel like something valuable was lost unlike how I did reading and watching both original sources. The animation in this film looks like it was made on ten dollars. All the characters move so slowly and weird. Everyone has noodle limbs. And overall everything looks weird. The voice acting also doesn't help. It's not awful but it can't even hold a candle to the near perfect acting in the original film. I could go on and on about why this movie is bad but I'll just leave it here because what I'm saying has most likely been said. Disney do better.",/review/rw8718083/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2022,peterwixongb,5," Felt Dull
","I really was hoping for an upgrade after last year's animated Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie came out. These had big shoes to fill because they will be compared to the original non-animated trilogy of films. But much like the first animated film, I was disappointed. The animation still lacked and the scenes didn't connect very well. It felt very drawn out, more than it needed to and the scenes were just boring. I suppose the voice acting was a little better. But there wasn't much of a chance for a phenomenal performance. I feel like the idea has potential but they really need to fix a lot if they plan to continue this animated movie series.",/review/rw8718083/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,jamesaltimate,1," Simply abhorrent
","From the start to the 1 hr and 17 minute climax I absolutely wanted to die during this abhorrent movie. It is a disgrace to basic human decency and I would have rather binge watched both of the tall girl movies thrice in a row. To be frank, I did did not only despise this movie, I felt repulsed at my own inability to stop watching this car crash of a production. From the unreasonably poor attempts at juvenile humour to the laughable attempts at emotional relatability, it stunned me in its shear lack of quality. I can not believe that a 'creative' team was payed real money to produce this absolute trash.",/review/rw8718083/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2022,LTPHarry,5," Not bad, but not great either. It's at least better than the first animated movie.

",The Diary of a Wimpy Kid books by Jeff Kinney are funny and have relatable characters. The people who have read the books or the Second book know what I am talking about.,/review/rw8718083/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2022,giorgiocelicarbajal,6," Bad, but better than the first one
","Ok, I know that this film is bad, and compared to the live-action movie there's a lot of different because the live-action was better, but this animated film is better than the first animated film of Diary of a Wimpy Kid.",/review/rw8718083/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,guilherme-aug430,10," Rodrick Rules...
","Ok, I read the book recently, and the first thing that I noticed is that they changed the approach, just like the first one, they cut some scenes, but the reference is still there. I liked this movie, because it's still has the references and has a better story. The character have a better story line, the relationship between Rodrick and Greg fells more real. I really like how they introduce Rodrick in this movie, not a villain, nor a hero, just a teenager, but not like those in the cartoons, on the talent show I wasn't expecting that, I really felt bad for him. And being an older brother myself, there are a lot of things I can relate to. So this is a good movie, better than the first one. I think Disney is on the right track with this one.",/review/rw8718083/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,TheMysteriousReviewer,5," This Movie Doesn't Rule Much
","Another movie in one year just like with the live-action trilogy, and this one? Yeah, I liked the live-action movie better. Like the first film, the animated version of Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules is entirely mixed as a movie. I'll give the movie does have a decent heart and the jokes are fine. However, there are also times where the movie does feel little doing something new from the book it was based on. Also, the characters do have good development, but some of them do seem despicable in a dull way. And the animation is fine, but often seems dated. Since the movie has now a proper full-length running time, I won't say to treat this as one of those specials. But all I can say is if you're not a fan of the first animated film, this is not for you. However if you want to see what the creator of the book himself does in movies even as a fan of the book series, then watch this at least once just to compare this to the book. The one thing I'll say is I was wrong about all these movies coming out every year. Because I read an article that the third movie is already on the works, but never mentioned it was going to release next year. You can tell Jeff Kinney is trying with the franchise, even in this and the first movie. Sure some may argue this and the first were faithful to the live action films, but at least he was trying to add some difference inspired from the book. Oh and by the way...Rest In Peace, Ed Asner.",/review/rw8718083/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2022,gimanjaya,3," They Rick Rolled us
","You wouldn't believe it, this whole movie is just nothing compared to the original. But it's more accurate to what happened in the book. But that doesn't really help it either. Last year when the first movie came out it was a devastating flop. The Animation, voice acting was horrible. As a huge Diary of a Wimpy Kid fan it hadn't been the same since the Long Haul, and the new Disney+ Project is making it worse. This movie seems to be more inline with the source material. It's obvious that they are trying hard to become meme cos Greg just played Never Gonna Give you up just to wake all the party animals up. This movie, in my opinion seems to be just a try hard attempt to make the series relatable for the younger generation, but their way of doing it is just bad.",/review/rw8718083/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2022,gabethedinosaur,10," This Christmas belongs to Roderick
",Rodrick rules was absolutely awesome. Kids will go crazy when they watch this on Disney plus . I have a feeling diray of a wimpy kid will have more projects next year and the year before that . The cast for this movie have made a remarkable comeback playing the characters in this movie . The live action films will always be the best for 20th century studios. But now it's Disneys turn to make more diray of a wimpy kids movies . And maybe release them in theaters for all kids and sell merchandise in all stores and that will draw lots of kids to see the movie over and over again .,/review/rw8718083/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,loveatfirstbitex,5," Meh...
","I dislike the series a bit now that it's animated. Just personal preference, but I like the live-action movies much better. Also, love the books. Will continue watching these movies because my son and I enjoy the series as a whole, but let's go back to how it was in the beginning!!",/review/rw8718083/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,paigejenkins-06015,2," Hated it
","I had high hopes as the original diary of a wimpy kid: rodrick rules is one of my favorite movies. But this animation disaster didn't live up to the hype of the original movie. The plot was all over the place and to me didn't make sense. The movie seemed rushed and unplanned. I didn't find any of the ""jokes"" funny nor did half of them make sense. I have this two stars because the animation style it's self was decent but the movie was bad. I would not watch again or recommend to anyone seeking a diary of a wimpy kid movie. This would be the last on my list of options. Hope they can redeem themselves for the next movie (if there will be one).",/review/rw8718083/?ref_=tt_urv
