8 March 2011,chumpsteak,8," Funny!
","I really expected to hate Mrs Brown's Boys. The format is very old fashioned, performances are OTT, the set & costumes look quite cheap. However, It's very funny & packed with quickfire gags, only a few of which fall flat. If you don't find one joke funny though, it doesn't matter because there are another 10 waiting round the corner & I don't care if some of them are old - they're still good. I actually find the old studio audience format refreshing & the addition of bad language & dirty jokes actually works pretty well. Plus, it's great to see the cast dropping out of character from time to time to have a giggle at the gags. They look like they're actually having fun! The pace of it is incredible & it really takes some talent to pull a sitcom like this off so well. it's not cool or edgy but so what? It's funny! So many recent comedies are not.",/review/rw6228066/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2017,miltonmunster,1," unfunny a massive understatement
","this is the most forced,overacted,overdone shyt ever had the misfortune to have to sit through while visiting friends & they raved about it.I nearly ground my teeth down several millimetres & even considered taking up smoking to just get away as toilet was in use,luckily made my phone ring.I mean each to their own but this was torture one could see the so called jokes coming miles away,so hokey even if you clockwork oranged me I couldn't watch it Id simply lose the will to live....must stop now bile rising",/review/rw6228066/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2011,Sleepin_Dragon,10," I absolutely love this show, viva Mrs Brown.
","I have to say i find this absolutely wonderful, i loved it. I love how on occasion they add a serious message, it's always bold. It's crude, it's not PC, what a breath of fresh air, Irish humour has always been something I've loved, this show simply enhances that feeling. The Matriarch Mrs Brown is stunningly portrayed, and the one liners are side splitting. How novel for a comedy to keep the outtakes in the transmission, it's great to see how much the cast seem to enjoy making it. I love the talks she has with her daughter Cathy, the actress who plays her always makes me smile and laugh for i feel she is laughing for real at many of the gags. I hope this wonderful show goes from strength to strength. 'It's a man in a dress you know, ' haha",/review/rw6228066/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2012,Rob_Taylor,1," Possibly the worst ""comedy"" series I've ever seen!
","I don't expect a lot out of comedy shows - a few laughs, some sight gags etc - but this falls totally flat in every way imaginable.",/review/rw6228066/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2011,Lomax343,9," Crude, tasteless and achingly funny
","This comedy has come in under the radar and has grown in popularity through word of mouth. It's basic ingredients are as old as the hills: a man in drag, bad language, farcical misunderstandings, recycled jokes and, if all else fails, slapstick. It owes a lot to I Didn't Know You Cared and Bread - and ought to be no more than a pale re-hash of a tired formula. It's as sophisticated as Bottom, as erudite as Play Your Cards Right, and as tasteful as a Frankie Boyle monologue.",/review/rw6228066/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2017,DavidYZ,1," Unfunny and old-fashioned
","I can't understand how such outdated, lame dross can be commissioned in the 2010s. This is old-fashioned in a bad way. Even in the 1970s, this would be second-rate. The protagonist is worse than when Dick Emery dressed in drag. None of the other actors are funny or entertaining, either.",/review/rw6228066/?ref_=tt_urv

11 March 2013,studioAT,1," Another 'Funny' BBC sitcom
",Oh dear. The BBC's grasp of comedy again baffles me and it's no wonder ITV have decided to try and do sitcoms again if this is all they have to beat. With 'Me and Mrs Jones' getting commissioned with great fanfare only to flop it's no wonder that this show makes it into a 3rd series.,/review/rw6228066/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2011,neil-upto11,1," I literally couldn't believe what I was watching.
",At first I thought it was a joke along the lines of 'When the Whistle Blows' - the spoof bbc sitcom from Ricky Gervais's 'Extras'. I genuinely waited for the punchline as this horror unfolded before me. As it dawned on me that it was NOT a joke (in any sense) I was staggered. Given its uncanny similarities to 'When the Whistle Blows' I cant do better than use the same review that it received in 'Extras':,/review/rw6228066/?ref_=tt_urv

12 June 2020,mdf-87936,3," Definitely not Father Ted
","The show has some funny scenes, but the humor quickly fizzles out. It doesn't hold up as well as the humor in Father Ted. Everyone I know, I recommend Father Ted to. This show, not so much.",/review/rw6228066/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2019,gibbs-18172,2," Robin Williams is spinning
","Utter crap.
The only reason it gets a 2 is for filming in front of a live studio audience, the only reason it dont score a 3 or 4 is that they laugh at every joke even before the audience.",/review/rw6228066/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2019,bertfw-2,2," An insult to viewers
","Going in I'd hoped this would be like a sillier version of ""All In The Family"", and while this does have similarities it has none of the delivery or genius. Let me just sum it up here - this show shares a lot with sitcoms of the mid-1970s. Jokes, production values, a live audience, a laugh track. Think of a very mediocre mid-70s sitcom and you've got this show. That's really all there is to it.",/review/rw6228066/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2021,MikeHunt1075,5," It was fun for a while.

7 January 2021,chloegalley,8," Was brilliant to start with. It's had it's day now !!!
",Mrs browns boys is a 2011 to present 5 series comedy created by Brendan O'Carroll. A comedy centered on a loud- mouthed Irish matriarch whose favourite pastime is meddling in the lives of her six children and friends. The first few series was absolutely brilliant but now it's had its day. I think Brendan is finding it hard coming up with new ideas and storylines now. What I do like about this is that they are all related and are friends of the family in real life. It will certainly cheer you up and have you laughing off your seat that's if you don't mind the strong language. Something to binge watch when in lockdown and will certainly put a smile on your face. I think you can stream the whole series on BBC I PLAYER right now. Contains a lot of bad language.,/review/rw6228066/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2011,stuartcork7,7," All of the ingredients are wrong, but the proof is in the eating.

13 February 2019,kieranrogers-84773,1," No redeeming qualities at all
","It's an old man dressed as a woman swearing and making rude jokes. That's the whole show. The characters are annoying and unlikeable, nobody can act that well, the laugh track basically has to inform you of when you're supposed to laugh. It's comedy aimed at the lowest common denominator that will laugh at anything.",/review/rw6228066/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2014,elijahhandley,1," A disgrace to British comedy
","I'm not really sure where to begin here. This 'comedy' somehow has managed to attain a 7.7 rating on this site as of the time of writing. All that infuriates me more than that is the fact that supporters of this rubbish compare it to the legendary 'Father Ted', one of the classic British comedies and amongst the funniest sitcoms ever produced. 'Mrs. Brown's Boys' is NOT a classic British comedy and it is certainly not amongst the funniest sitcoms ever produced.",/review/rw6228066/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2014,doubt_it,1," What's going on?
","I feel like I'm losing my mind... everyone seems to love this and I can't even begin to comprehend why. Now I love British comedy like the Mighty Boosh, Monty Python, Peter Cooke & Dudley Moore, IT Crowd, Facejacker, Brass Eye... the list goes on. This is just insulting: it's like a laugh track surgically stapled to some painfully unfunny situations. Most of the humor seems to hinge off the fact that the main character is a man dressed up as a woman. Imagine that! The absurdity!! What will they think of next?! I can imagine this would've been a hilarious concept back in 1950 but come on. And I don't have any problem with crude humor... if it's funny and has a purpose rather than just being there to facilitate a knee jerk awkward giggle response because the basic material isn't up to scratch, which is what we have here. Maybe the era of quality British comedy is over and my tastes haven't 'evolved' that far yet. Anyhoo, rant over, I'm going to rethink a few things.",/review/rw6228066/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2012,sammy_c,1," Can't believe how terrible this is
","This dreadful sitcom staggers from one tired, obvious, unfunny 70s clich√© to the next, pausing only to mug directly at the camera. It is old-timey music hall bawdy slapstick and sentiment, in the Benny Hill/Les Dawson/Bernard Manning tradition. If someone is swearing into a phone, the Vicar will be on the other end of the line, and so on. I get the impression its audience is mostly older and long for the ""simpler"" times of the 70s, or they are young children who have never seen a sitcom before. Either way its commercial success continues to amaze me. ",/review/rw6228066/?ref_=tt_urv
