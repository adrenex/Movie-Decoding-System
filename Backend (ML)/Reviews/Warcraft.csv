","I had no idea what was going on most of the time because I'm not particularly familiar with Warcraft's story. That being said, this is a decent movie, especially considering it's a video game franchise film...90% of the time video game films are very badly adapted to the screen.",/review/rw3487218/?ref_=tt_urv

","When the world of the Orcs Draenor is being destroyed by the evil fel magic that uses life-force, the powerful warlock Gul'dan creates a portal to the world of Azeroth and forms the Horde with members of the Orc clans. He also captures many prisoners to keep the portal. The king of Azeroth Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) and his brother-in-law Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) are informed by the apprentice of magician Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) that he has found fel magic in dead bodies and the king decides to summon the Guardian of Tirisfal Medivh (Ben Foster) to protect his kingdom. Lothar and Khadgar head Kharazhan to meet Medivh and a shadow points a book to Khagdar and he takes it and hides. Anduin, Khadgar and Medivh and a group of soldiers are attacked by Orcs and they capture the slave Garona (Paula Patton), who is released by King Llane, and she shows the location of the portal. Garona is contacted by the Orc chief of a clan Durotan that wants to meet King Llane to stop the fel magic. Meanwhile Khadgar learns that the gate was opened with the help of someone in Azeroth. Shall King Lllane trust on Garona and Durotan? Whi might be the traitor? ",/review/rw3487218/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2016,siderite,8," Done really well, considering
","There were several constraints that the movie had to work with. There was the already established Warcraft mythos and stories, there was the terrible stigma of game adaptations and finally there was the matter of so many main CGI characters that had to look realistic, not like something Pixar or Disney designed. Given that, I was not expecting much.",/review/rw3487218/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2016,morais-aniel,," Honest review
","First of all let me say that I never played Warcraft but I played other blizzard Games like Starcraft, Diablo and Overwatch. I enjoyed a lot this movie and want more, much more. I have to say that the movie is actually very good (not great, but very good). The CGI is awesome, they should as example to the next Hulk. The movie could be better? Yes, but honestly, this is probably the best adaptation of a video game. I had no problem to follow the story, the plot is simple (could be better). The names are very complicated to remember (lol). The orcs are the core of the movie, they are much more interesting them the humans in my opinion. I believe the director was so focused in have the CGI right that maybe he forgot the human actors. I don't understand why the ""professional"" critics were so harsh with this movie.",/review/rw3487218/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2017,kosmasp,8," Pretty fun
","For an adaptation of a popular game, this is pretty fun. It tries to do both sides justice (good and bad are a fine line, when you get both perspectives), which may anger a couple of people, but is a nice touch. I have only played the original Warcraft games and never got around to the World of Warcraft one. Which on one hand is a good thing of course, considering how much time I would have been online playing.",/review/rw3487218/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2017,Bored_Dragon,7," Good, but not great
","To begin with, I have to say I'm not Warcraft fan. I played the game occasionally, but I never gave too much thought to it nor read anything related to this lore, so I'm not competent to say if movie is faithful to original story or not. But I am fan of epic fantasy and it's my favorite genre. The only thing that somewhat bothered me was that two hours is not nearly enough to tell this story proper. Fact that movie feels incomplete is acceptable, cause it is obvious this is just the base for movies that will follow and this franchise looks very promising. But even just introduction to this world can not fit in only two hours. It needs at least three hours, or even two movies for this part of the story to be told right. Beside that I have no other objections. It is very good movie. But they call it The Lord of the Rings for the new generation. That's where I must draw a line. However good this movie is it is not worthy to be even compared to LOTR. Not only it is blasphemy to say that Warcraft is better or equally good, but they are beyond any comparison. Even after fifteen years nothing came even close to LOTR, let alone overthrow it from the throne of the genre. Maybe this movie standing alone deserves higher rating than what I rated it, and if there was no LOTR maybe I would rate it much higher, but LOTR set standards so high for this genre and in every single aspect it so much better than Warcraft, that on the scale where LOTR is ten, I simply can not give this movie more than seven. Still, I warmly recommend this adventure to all genre lovers and I can not wait for the sequels.",/review/rw3487218/?ref_=tt_urv

21 May 2016,christopherholich,8," Is The Video Game Curse Broken?
","First off, i would like to point out Duncan Jones has made another fantastic flick. Better than source code, but me personally i loved moon so.... Warcraft isn't good enough to beat it lol. So Everything about this movie felt right. And i would like to point out this movie is about the warcraft storyline (First game) Not World Of Warcraft. The acting was good, the pacing was great. The CGI was amazing! Gul'dan was an awesome villain. Never heard of Daniel Wu But i feel like he will be voice acting more characters soon. I love how they wear that ridiculous armor that a normal person can't stand up in. Lothar was an amazing main character, and I only know Travis Fimmel because he's in the show vikings but i feel like if the rest of the critics like this movie this could be his breakthrough movie. If there is a sequel then i would definitely go and see it. And lads, The Video game curse is broken! Hopefully Assassins Creed will live up to the hype! Fans will love it, people who like lord of the rings or the hobbit will love it, just regular people who has never played WoW will love it! All in all, i think that the hype was well worth it and it is definitely going to be a recommend for me! After you have seen Captain America go see Warcraft, you wont regret it.",/review/rw3487218/?ref_=tt_urv

","I should start by explaining that I am not a fan of comic books, movies made from comic books, nor movies that have a comic book type story, with the utter and complete lack of plausibility in every single scene. I do like magical realism, and fantasy though. This movie had a few good elements. Some of the giants were cool, and the costumes were probably the best part of the movie.

16 October 2016,leonblackwood,7," Very entertaining! 7/10
","Review: I really appreciated the effort that was put into this movie, and I thoroughly felt entertained throughout. The ORC Warriors looked great and the cinematography was spot on but the director needed a few A-list actors to play the human roles. King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) was useless put I have to commend him for physically going into war when he had to. Ben Cooper was great as the magical wizard Medivh, even though they made him look like Jesus but the guy who really impressed me was Travis Fimmel, who played Anduin Lothar. I liked the chemistry between Anduin and Garona (Paula Patton), and the relationship between Durotan and Draka was really sweet. The action scenes were pretty impressive, especially the fight scene between Durotan and Gul'dan towards the end and the director cleverly added a touch of wit, which lightened the intense situation. Everyone seemed to be ignoring the clever Khadgar, who ended up being a real hero, and the great touches like the flying birds and massive wolves, made the movie a joy to watch. The attention to detail on all of the Orcs, we're truly remarkable but the ending was quite abrupt, which spoilt the flow of the movie. Anyway, I completely enjoyed this movie, and I can't wait to see the sequel. Enjoyable!",/review/rw3487218/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was surprised to learn that this movie was panned by critics upon its release and that it bombed in the box office, I thought this is a pretty decent movie. It has a good entertainment value, the CGI was actually excellent and you could rank it as same league with most high-budgeted superhero movies. The performances were good tho some could be better. The storyline's all over the place at times but it's not hard to follow and the score is fitting. It even set up a sequel which I doubt will ever happen due to this movie's performance, but you never know what the future has in store.",/review/rw3487218/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2016,Rob_Taylor,7," Warcraft fans will love it.
","First off, I'm going to address the reasons why people hate this movie. Simply put, it throws you in the deep end of a complicated and involved mythos and expects you to either go with it, or gtfo. There is precious little in the way of explanation of who the characters are, why they have the motivations they do, or how they all interact with one another.",/review/rw3487218/?ref_=tt_urv

","Let me just put this out there right now: I have never played Warcraft. My experience with Warcraft is limited to one of my friends from school being hospitalized because he survived solely on Dr. Pepper for a week while playing the darn thing. I say this because many within a certain community will see any criticism towards this film suspect; even more so coming from someone from the outside looking in. All that said, Warcraft the movie is not that bad.",/review/rw3487218/?ref_=tt_urv
