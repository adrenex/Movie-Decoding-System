19 December 2021,Turfseer,6," A little bit too much Dr. Jekyll and not enough Mr. Hyde in this tennis dad hagiography
","The Merriam-Webster dictionary definition of hagiography is ""biography of saints or venerated persons."" And haven't director Reinaldo Green and star Will Smith done that here with their portrait of Richard Williams, father of the Williams sisters, two of the most famous players in the history of women's tennis? Well maybe not completely but the glass here is certainly a lot more half full than half empty.",/review/rw8027169/?ref_=tt_urv

5 December 2021,Sir_AmirSyarif,6," Fails to serve a powerful, winning smash
","Although it has its moments, Reinaldo Marcus Green's 'King Richard' fails to serve a powerful, winning smash. It is mostly formulaic, with some of the drama bordering on melodramatic. Will Smith delivers a pretty monotonous, borderline caricatured performance. The 'King Richard' star dwarfs, especially when combined with a forceful Aunjanue Ellis and a revealing Saniyya Sidney, and leaves the film without a compelling central figure.",/review/rw8027169/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2021,djurrepower,5," american
","Sure its a well made movie, but I have my issues with the direction. Mainly that it just feels void of character. It felt more like a sitcom, with a very streamlined narrative. Its very clear what emotion you need to feel at what point. The music is very blunt, and there is very little room for interpertation.",/review/rw8027169/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2021,CubsandCulture,6," Effective Oscar bait
",Smith fans should be pleased with this film. It is a good show case for the actor. It is one of Smith's better performances as well. It's almost real acting from the star. The film is perfectly pleasant because of Smith alone.,/review/rw8027169/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,Gordon-11,," Uplifting
","""King Richard"" is an interesting film, because we all know what the ending is, but have no idea of the process. Therefore, it has to have an engaging middle, so that the sure ending becomes well deserved. Acting is good by all actors and actresses. I enjoyed watching this uplifting film.",/review/rw8027169/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2021,ferguson-6,7," The Plan
","Greetings again from the darkness. Sports parents. Band parents. Dance parents. Cheerleader parents. Drama parents. We all know THOSE parents ... and many of us, whether we admit it or not, ARE those parents. Director Reinaldo Marcus Green (JOE BELL, 2020) and first time screenwriter Zach Baylin bring us the story of the unconventional, hard-driving, flawed, well-intentioned father of tennis superstars Venus and Serena Williams.",/review/rw8027169/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2021,Johnny_West,1," Unfresh Prince?
","King Richard is the fantasy story of the father of Venus and Serena Williams. While everyone knows the truth is that their father was a very hard and disciplined taskmaster/father, here in this movie, the father is more like Forest Gump of tennis.",/review/rw8027169/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2021,rachbruno,1," The story of King Richard isn't interesting enough for a movie
","Would love to have seen a movie about Venus and Serena, from their perspective. That story would have been more interesting. This movie is scene after scene of Will Smith arguing with everyone to prove he's right, over and over.",/review/rw8027169/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2021,fallyhag,5," Rather bland with no imagination ðŸ’¤

9 April 2022,h2223,4," Why did this bland movie lead to a Best Actor win for Smith?

19 March 2022,westsideschl,2," Glossed Over
","97+% of young athletes who focus on a sport dream for the future end up poorer in two respects. First, there's little life value in all that time spent on playing ball vs studying when the game ends after high school or maybe first year or so in college. Even college is a waterslide of just a few fluff courses helped w/very friendly ghost writing tutors (I know, as a graduate assistant, I oversaw that process.). Second, is the loss of exposure to a wealth of worldly experience that an educational focus would have brought.",/review/rw8027169/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2021,wumbi,5," Somewhat boring
","Richard is shown as an imperious loudmouth and other times they constantly reminding us how genius his plan is, they do show his good side but more so on the bad side. In the end we see a refinement in his character but only for a brief and it doesn't do justice to what really happened. All around great performances, though Will's may be overdone and Jon Bernthal's performance was surprisingly great. Often times the movie went into a moment of boredom when they elongated a conflict then repeat that said conflict 15 minutes later. The rest was filled with training montages with music you'd expect from a sport movie. It has an incredibly story yet somehow boredom prevails.",/review/rw8027169/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2022,evanston_dad,6," Pretty Boring
","Pretty boring biopic about the early days of tennis stardom for Venus and Serena Williams, focusing on the role their father played in their success.",/review/rw8027169/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2021,drjgardner,7," Good film
","This is a good sports film and has lots of revealing information about the Williams family that most people will not be aware of. Remarkably, Will Smith puts aside his constant need to show himself off and gets absorbed into the personality of the Williams' father.. All the acting is great, especially the 5 girls and the mom. Of course the film is from the POV of the Dad and I imagine there are other viewpoints. I was disappointed that given the emphasis on the Dad, when the film ends and they give a summary of what happened after, nothing is mentioned about the Dad. That makes no sense in the context of the film.",/review/rw8027169/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2022,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,6," Not worthy of the best picture Oscar
","The movie is weird. The Williams sisters stayed behind, making a movie about their father. It's really weird. Will Smith, Aunjanue Ellis and Jon Bernthal did a great job. My rating for the movie is 6. This movie is so weird. Good movie, but one that was made for the Oscars. That's why it didn't feel like an honest movie to me. Good movie, but instead of Williams sisters, their father is in the foreground. I don't know if it's true or not. I think the sisters were producers or something in the making of this movie. I do not know. Not worthy of the best picture Oscar.",/review/rw8027169/?ref_=tt_urv

5 December 2021,lfc357,3," An hour too long

22 November 2021,meldavies74,3," One note

2 April 2022,wisdomwasp,1," Hardly a king nor the one who played it
","Will smith, one of my favourite actors since Independence Day, Men in Black, Bad Boys, heck even Wild Wild West and Bright has looked to take his career in a more serious and maybe even activist path. I can't say whether this Will Smith that's been revealed from *the incident* has always been there or is a product of having domestic issues, but I don't know if I can ever watch him again. I want to believe his apology is genuine but it's hard to believe. He's always been likeable, even when kooky, even when trying to get on the social media/YouTube train. His likeability is gone from one of his worst moments that everyone saw. And his speech made things worse. But I believe in redemption, Lord knows I need it more than Will so I hope he makes the right changes here.",/review/rw8027169/?ref_=tt_urv

2 April 2022,sirfire,1," Two reasons not to watch
