27 June 2017,lesleyharris30,6," Well Acted, Poorly Developed,
","The Gambler is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a great cast. Mark Wahlberg makes some very interesting acting choices in this movie, losing weight for the part and portraying the character in a way that really stretches beyond his usual style. I also loved the chemistry between him and Brie Larson, it was definitely the strongest aspect of the film, in my opinion, as it was pure and felt very real.",/review/rw3148102/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2015,deloudelouvain,7," Not as bad as some want to make us believe.
","I read some reviews here I can see that we have mixed feelings about The Gambler. Some hate it, some love it. I thought it was an okay movie to watch once. I didn't think it was that boring like some want to make us believe. Mark Wahlberg plays a gambler that isn't very passionate about his life anymore. He just searches for somebody to live for, to give him some passion in his boring life. Due to his lack of passion for anything he creates big debts and he doesn't really care about it. Maybe the debt collectors should have been a bit more violent to make the movie more satisfying to some but to me it was okay. Michael Kenneth Williams gave us a good performance as well. John Goodman with a smaller role was also good in his typical way. I found the soundtrack of the movie really good. It just fitted really well with the story and ambiance. Unlike others I wasn't bored at all with this movie. I certainly saw worse movies then this one.",/review/rw3148102/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2015,pyrocitor,7," A treatise on emptiness, yet not empty itself
","If there is one thing to be said about The Gambler, it is this: its poster is about as indicative as can be. For those who have yet to see the film, gear up for plenty of close-ups of a sullen, recalcitrant Mark Wahlberg fuming silently at the camera, caught somewhere between wordless scream for help and smirk of feigned badassery. Whether or not you have the stomach for two hours of much of the same is a matter of personal preference, but The Gambler, while a necessarily corkscrew of repetitive dour scenarios, explores the nature of emptiness in life, it is far from empty itself.",/review/rw3148102/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2015,valleyjohn,7," Much better than some reviews are saying
","I have read few unfavourable reviews about The Gambler mostly saying the film is not gripping enough. I disagree. At no stage did i lose interest in what was going on and i thought the tension was palpable at times. A really good leading performance from Mark Wahlberg and it's good to see Michael Kenneth Williams ( Omar Little from The Wire ) in a big role. If i had to be picky i would say that the three people who Jim owed money to could have been a little bit more menacing and the ending is a little bit confusing ( or that could just be me ! ). Overall though an entertaining , enjoyable movie which also has a great soundtrack.",/review/rw3148102/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2014,StevePulaski,6," The equivalent of watching interesting parts struggling to find something to work with that shows their importance
","The seedy underworlds that are often associated with gambling and the mafia are worlds that loan themselves to film, for they breed certain characters, themes, and ideas that simply captivate, and provide audiences with ideas as to how a subculture operates. Having said that, it's a shame in the last few years, we've gotten a small, mediocre array of these films when the genre used to be dominated by the likes of people like Martin Scorsese, Al Pacino, and Robert De Niro, who knew how to create arresting films based off the mob. With Rupert Wyatt's The Gambler, a remake of the James Caan film of the same name coming at the end of the year following a recent trailer release like the film's release was an afterthought, we get another middling effort to showcase strong acting talent but mediocre-to-average screen writing as we watch a captivating idea be squandered by a bloated yet underdeveloped plot.",/review/rw3148102/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2015,wendy-weist,9," Not About Gambling
",This movie is about a man who has given up hope on achieving his dreams and is trying to make his pain stop by engaging in self destructive behavior... his weapon of choice is gambling but he is not a gambler. He says so multiple times. I have read the many negative reviews of this movie and I think people are really just missing the point. He wants a real love and something real to do every day and if he achieve anything beyond mediocrity then he would rather be dead. People who can relate with that sentiment will love this movie but perhaps no one else. If you enjoy a movie that makes you think a little and go beyond what's on the surface. The movie is not about gambling... it is about finding inspiration and hope.,/review/rw3148102/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2015,larrys3,3," Beyond Ridiculous
","The dark 1974 movie ""The Gambler"", starring James Caan, I thought was the definitive film about compulsive gambling. Although this modern version gives credit to James Toback (writer of the 1974 movie), I'm sorry to say I found this film to be beyond ridiculous, with incredibly stilted and pretentious dialogue, as well as absurd characters and situations.",/review/rw3148102/?ref_=tt_urv

","I can't really answer that, because I haven't seen the original movie this is based on. I try to watch the original movies, before watching a remake, but I couldn't in this case. All I know is that James Caan was in the original as well as in this one (although his role in this one is pretty limited, still impactive though).",/review/rw3148102/?ref_=tt_urv

","Despite being tedious and annoyingly creating its own problems, The Gambler is still a really good drama that manages to come to a very satisfying conclusion. Mark Wahlberg is great.

27 April 2015,cosmo_tiger,7," A movie that I did ultimately like and recommend but it is a little generic and lacking the punch it was going for.
","""Eventually a debt gets too big to pay."" Jim Bennett (Wahlberg) is an English professor at a major college, as well as being a high stakes gambler. He isn't very good at either. When he falls into an insurmountable debt to a ruthless loan shark one life begins to bleed into the other and his life, and the lives of those around him, is in danger. Going in I thought this movie could go 1 of 2 ways. It could either be tense and good, or slow and boring. After watching it I would have to say it is more tense and good, but also nothing amazing. I did like this quite a bit and recommend this, but it just seems like they could have done so much more with this character. Another down side of this movie is that it is pretty much like every other movie about gambling. The best part of this movie is John Goodman, but he is so under used that it is a little upsetting. If he was in it more the movie would have been better. Overall, a movie that I did ultimately like and recommend but it is a little generic and lacking the punch it was going for. I give it a B.",/review/rw3148102/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2016,gradyharp,8," 'You're born as a man with the nerves of a soldier, the apprehension of an angel'
","Screenwriter and self confessed compulsive gambler James Toback joined William Monahan to concoct this rather bizarre but ultimately fascinating film about a very bright English Literature Associate Professor who is an inveterate gambler. Rupert Wyatt directs this cross between philosophy of life and the dangers of the life of gambling. Jim Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) is a risk taker. Both an English professor and a high-stakes gambler, Bennett bets it all when he borrows from a gangster (Michael Kenneth Williams) and offers his own life as collateral. Always one step ahead, Bennett pits his creditor against the operator of a gambling ring and leaves his dysfunctional relationship with his wealthy mother (Jessica Lange) in his wake. He plays both sides, immersing himself in an illicit, underground world while garnering the attention of Frank (John Goodman in a superb performance), a loan shark with a paternal interest in Bennett's future. As his relationship with a student (Brie Larson) deepens, Bennett must take the ultimate risk for a second chance.",/review/rw3148102/?ref_=tt_urv

I would not have imagined Mark as a one hit wonder novelist turned lit professor from a wealthy background who seems on the road to self destruction due to his gambling habit.

26 November 2014,trublu215,4," Wahlberg delivers a tour dè force performance
","The Gambler tells the story of Jim Bennett, a college professor with a dangerous and self destructive addiction to gambling at underground casinos in the underbelly of Los Angeles. His addiction soon begins to effect his professional and personal life to severe and deadly consequences. The Gambler features great performances from Mark Wahlberg and Jessica Lange along with flashy and stylish direction from Rupert Wyatt. Much like the 1974 original, The Gambler is very much so a character study. We see Wahlberg's Jim Bennett in every scene, and see him make every bet, lose every hand and blow every dollar without shying away from Wahlberg. This is a new, transformed and extremely mature performance from Mark Wahlberg. He is in top form here, delivering a career best performance along with the physicality of a twig. It is certainly a better portrayal of a teacher than what we see in 2008's horrendous misfire The Happening. When we see Wahlberg in The Gambler he loses himself in long monologues that never once will make you question his validity in this part. The supporting cast features Brie Larson, Jessica Lange and John Goodman. Each give amazing performances, especially Goodman who steals some scenes from Wahlberg with colorful monologues filled with expletives and subtext that is classic William Monohan but it does grow tiring after awhile. The screenplay written by Oscar winner William Monohan is far from a perfect script but it is very interesting and keeps your attention. It doesn't pack the punch The Departed did, but it gets the job done. Rupert Wyatt proves that not only can he do a big budget action spectacle as Rise of the Planet of the Apes but he can also deliver hard hitting drama. My only issue was that Martin Scorsese is such a huge influence here in filmmaking style that you start to wonder what it would be like if Wyatt just stuck to his own style instead of trying to capture something that is clearly above his talent because it does backfire on multiple occasions especially during its Hollywood-fueled finale. For a film as dark as The Gambler, the ending just simply doesn't fit and feels more like a studio ending rather than something that would be true to the film and true to the original vibe of it all. Overall, The Gambler is a fitting remake that fails to capture the essence of the original but displays Mark Wahlberg in a career changing performance that shouldn't be missed.",/review/rw3148102/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Gambler was a difficult film to rate. It was a movie that not everyone is going to like because not everyone is going to relate to Mark Wahlberg's character. It was a hard movie to understand. After seeing this movie you will either love it or hate it. There is really no in between. You really had to connect with the main character and his personality, and that's not possible for everyone. I really enjoyed the film because i really connected with it, but that is not going to be the case for everyone. I would highly recommend seeing it just to take the chance of loving it.

20 February 2015,videorama-759-859391,8," Don't gamble in what is an addictive watch
","If ever there was an anti gambling film, this is it. This film just shows what an addiction, gambling is, and what d..kheads they are. Why do people do it? For this gambler, Jim Bennett (Wahlberg in one of best ever performances) who bets big, and loses big (just see how big). The question here, posed in the movie, is why, the answer is for us audience to figure. I didn't know until later, that this was a remake. I never saw the original, but I was a bit p..sed to learn that, as Hollywood is now taking this just too far, with remakes, as though the think tank is losing it's volume. Jim is also a college professor, and of course, he falls in love with one of the students, a prized and pretty student (Brie Larson) who I must say looked hot at the start, who is seen working at this underground casino on the outskirts of the L.A freeway. The opening scene with the great George Kennedy on his death bed, with Wahlberg, says everything about son and grandfather relationship, but it would of been better with Kennedy playing the father. The movie doesn't wasn't you to know much about the characters, the mains are here and there, so we're more focused on Wahlberg. We feel Wahlberg's pain, but also feel anger at the character he is, and the suicidal path he's taking. Gambling is a terrible disease, and I urge people with this kind of addiction to see this, where it's ending there's beautiful light at the end of tunnel, played against a wonderful soundtrack. Other great performances are from a much more flabby Goodman (keep your shirt on please) as a loan shark, you don't wanna mess with. Lange, fantastic as usual, has still got it, playing as Wahlberg's mum, while Michael Kenneth Williams added some nice menace as a collector, with heart and a conscience, where you don't see many of these characters come with these. You can't overlook Wahlberg's performance, of Oscar status, or definitely worth of some acting accolades. This is one performance of his you gotta see, in a movie you gotta see.",/review/rw3148102/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2016,SpringBeagle,5," Lacks the Required Grittiness
","This would have been much easier to remake if the director had stayed true to the grittiness of the original. It's stripped clean here. From the cinematography, to the acting, the music and more, there is an overall lack of desperation. It's as if everyone making the film has never experienced desperation or addiction of any sort, which I know can't be true. Even the music is inappropriate and sounds like someone randomly picked tunes from their favorite alternative rock radio station. The romantic subplot is mere fluff and also lacks grit from the casting to the photography and inappropriate music making me feel as if I was suddenly watching a romantic comedy. Why did this UCLA beach blonde love interest work in a underground Asian owned casino? Huh? Shouldn't she have been Asian? And what would a young college student even see in this loser? Some choices just made no sense and were out of date, out of context, and simply not the right tone. I would say even Mark Wahlberg was in over his head and the role was not the right fit for him.",/review/rw3148102/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2016,anaconda-40658,9," Take the Gamble.
","The Gambler (2014): Dir: Rupert Wyatt / Cast: Mark Wahlberg, John Goodman, Brie Larson, Michael K. Williams, Jessica Lange: Film about the dangerous lifestyle where everything is at risk. Mark Wahlberg plays literature professor Jim Bennett whose gambling addiction is so bad that he borrows from one loan shark to pay off another. He owes money and his life has a time limit if he fails to pay up. Michael K. Williams plays one of the loan sharks whom he owes a debt and he threatens to harm a female student whom Bennett is involved if he doesn't pay up. He makes a proposition that involves one of Bennett's students who could go pro in basketball. John Goodman steals moments as another loan shark who loans him money but not without a severe warning. Bennett's addiction is so horrendous that even when he is loaned money, he ends up pissing it all away gambling. This is the case with his frustrated mother, played by Jessica Lange who reluctantly takes her son to the bank where she takes out a large sum of cash. She views her relationship with her son as dead, and worse yet, he doesn't seem moved by her actions. Brie Larson plays a bright literature student who engages with Bennett until they entangle romantically. Well written despite a repetitious structure where Bennett is seen in constant inner torture but freedom can be reached, and the third act wisely wraps this up in a clever manner. Theme addresses addiction, mainly to gambling and how far one's life can spiral out of control and into the depths of despair and gambling with the lives of those around us.

31 December 2014,nysalesman,1," How much money did Mark Walberg owe the mob to be forced into this movie?
","I never thought I would see the day when Mark Walberg appeared in a bad movie. Of course the usual clueless eggheads and elitist wannabes had to give it rave reviews because, in their minds, some jittery screen effects made a boring, classless movie 'artsy.'",/review/rw3148102/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2014,RogerCampbell,10," Wahlberg, Goodman, and Williams are solid and believable in their roles. Not a bad movie
","The Gambler is a poignant tale of a man who is in the grips of one of life's worst addictions. The Gambler is moving in several ways in that you find yourself feeling for the man's family and friends because they are dragged into his dark world as he struggles with a demon that has cost him everything. At the same time you are not only hoping that he will do the right thing and get out as he is given opportunities to do, but you are also fearing for the mans personal safety because he squanders opportunities to pay off an ever mounting debt to men that will stop at nothing to collect. Wahlberg plays the part of the gambler perfectly as do John Goodman and Michael Kenneth Williams as a couple of lone sharks who allow him to get deeper and deeper into the abyss of his addiction. The ending is comforting in knowing that he finally breaks free and will now be able to pursue a normal life with a new love that he has found. Unfortunately, counting on that one last big bet to get yourself out is seldom how it works in real life. The end is dramatic yes, but realistic no. The Gambler is a movie that is well worth watching, but it may hit home for many families who have a loved one who struggles with this terrible addiction.",/review/rw3148102/?ref_=tt_urv
