14 July 2020,ahmedgorshy,10," I wished that one day will come and amend that wrong image Fortunately of us ,this day came and Ramy came with it .
","You can find out from my name that I am a Muslim and you can also know how many Muslims around the world suffer all the time from problems and accusations that we are terrorists to our endless problems and the wrong stereotype I wished that only one day will come and amend that wrong image Fortunately this day came and Ramy came with it .
Ramy is a comedy drama series, but it is mostly dramatic and reflects it in a simple way. He does not exaggerate in comedy and does not try to be very serious about subtraction.
The show features many representations of story and music
Ramy may not be the ideal image for Muslims, but what is fun if it is perfect?
The best thing about the show that Americans may not really understand is the struggle that we suffer as Muslims daily between being believers and our sins. Americans may not be considered important but it is important for every believer.",/review/rw5801003/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2020,Eggoreluckadman,8," Season 1 is a comedy season 2 is a dramedy
","I loved season 1 funny, original, and thought provoking. Season 2 takes on a different tone that still is original and thought provoking but not as funny as Season 1.",/review/rw5801003/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2019,dslynn17,10," Loving it!
","I am a 60 year old american woman....never to old to learn insights into other cultures. This show is educational, spot on not only about Muslims and Arabs but about our current culture as well. It is funny and so smartly written and acted. Every actor cast is perfect....makes you feel these people are right next to me living this plot out and not actors at all. So good....",/review/rw5801003/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2020,alfa-624-376688,10," Totally adorable as the hipster/ muslim boy
","I am a 57 year old Dutch man who accidentally found this series as I was scrolling down the list of Golden Globe winners. I thought the premise stood out, and gave it a try. Well, I am so pleasantly surprised by Ramy! First of all Ramy himself is totally adorable as the hipster/ muslim boy. He is charming, handsome, funny and smart. Ramy wants to be a good muslim but finds himself often in situations where it is impossible to choose to be a decent muslim or a happy cityboy. This makes for bittersweet episodes that pile up prejudice upon prejudice. Ramy gives all his family member and friends their own stories, many times so confrontational it becomes painful to watch, but luckily the many funny twists make it still digestible. Ramy undeniable has deserved his Golden Globe. The stories Ramy tells are spot on. They capture American society from a muslim perspective and that is not often seen on tv. I should also mention the photography, it is gorgious and artful, and at its best in the surreal scenes.",/review/rw5801003/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2019,brown-banana,10," Must-watch for Arabs in the 'West'
","Speaking as an Egyptian-American Muslim, I can relate to a lot of what happens on the show. I've been through similar struggles before and I'm even currently going through that same identity struggle. One of the great aspects of the show that I can't stress enough is it's authenticity. While these struggles obviously don't portray what every Muslim goes through, I have been able to relate to most of the aspects of the show through either past experiences I've been through myself or through someone else I know. From the struggles that Ramy personally experiences, or the struggles that his sister and parents deal with, they all show a truth that many of us have lived with and it's refreshing seeing this accurate depiction.",/review/rw5801003/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2020,benji-UCLA,10," Are these people claiming this isn't ""real"" enough even muslim?
","Some of the reviews are so frustrating. This is spot on with its portrayal of a Muslim family...with parents who immigrated here and children who were raised here....saying it isn't ""Muslim"" enough because the kids swear in front of their parents...I have always swore in front of my parents among other things that I think become more normal or common the longer we were here. After a while a lot of Muslim families in America kind of mash these new American normalcies with how a Muslim family might live who did NOT immigrate to America. This is spot on...the ""Muslims"" who decided this isn't real enough based on THEIR opinion and nothing else are so ignorant. This show is AMAZING!",/review/rw5801003/?ref_=tt_urv

13 May 2020,pangipingu,10," Entertaining!
","To all those viewers (Muslims & non- Muslims), who criticize this series for delivering an inaccurate picture of the Muslim community in the US, one must remind them that Ramy is not a docuseries and never meant to be. It is Ramy Yussef's comedic take on leading life as a Muslim boy in a foreign country filled with varied faiths.",/review/rw5801003/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2020,ishanmanutdfan,10," Atlanta, Master of None, Louie and now this
","Like all the other shows mentioned in the subject Ramy takes a deep dive into the culture the protagonist lives in. It's funny, sad, emotional, hilarious and is a rollercoaster for emotions.
Don't think of it as a comedy it's a show about the reality of living in Muslim/ethnic family and because it's a TV show and not a documentary there are some exaggerations which people in other reviews can't grasp but what can you do.
As an ethnic immigrant who grew around Muslims in Australia, this show is stirs up conversation of the taboos in a brown society and explores each character with time and care.
Again if you're a fan of the other shows you'll love this, if not then give it a shot with any expectations (specially expectation to be offended)",/review/rw5801003/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2019,awesomeman-toto,8," Pretty Great
","It's like Atlanta but for Arabs and Muslims. It's pretty early but critic reviews have been great and the fan reviews have been oddly low. I think people are boycotting for some awful reason. Relatable for sure, not just for Arabs and Muslims, but for everyone really. Anyone who may feel they don't know their place in the world or their community. The acting is very solid, especially from the parents who are both incredible.",/review/rw5801003/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2019,randolphnimmer,10," Thought-provoking and insightful identity-driven comedy
","I can't speak to the authenticity of the show, as I do not come from this background. The show offers a platform for an under-represented wedge of our melting pot, which I think is important. That platform is used to great effect. The writing is witty and insightful. The characters are likable and interesting with enough depth to keep you interested. I really believe this to be a must-watch.",/review/rw5801003/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2020,jordan2240,5," Muslims are people too
","Enjoyed the first two episodes because I thought they showed how anyone can go through the same conflicts about faith and morality, but episode 3 was such that I don't know that I'll watch any further. Apparently, the main character is the only person in his peer group with any morals, and every girl he meets is not only attracted to him, but is also a sex fiend. Where were these women when I was dating???",/review/rw5801003/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2020,youssef_salam,10," From comedy to god and tears
","First, this review is from an Arab Muslim because a lot of the negative reviews highlight that they are Arab Muslims.
After finishing season 2 of Ramy, I was left with a lot and a lot of questions that needed an answer. answers not from the series or the creators, but from myself. and only me.",/review/rw5801003/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2019,ayamisr,7," good in many ways
","So when I heard about a series made by an american streaming service about an american Muslim young man of Egyptian descent I, being and Egyptian Muslim, kinda knew what to expect, conflict between the liberal american life style and the conservative Islamic beliefs and of course parents who value the traditions of the old country more than they value religion which common among born Muslims and quit honestly the show didn't disappoint, it showed a weird Egyptian everyday family living in the American society so this part of it didn't surprise me but was never the less very delightful.
what truly surprised me, in a good way, however was all the 1980s and 1990s nostalgia left subtly for Egyptian in the know in most of the Arabic music that featured in the show but the most delightfully surprising part of it is Amr Waked's make up, it's like everyday before shooting he went to the make up artist looking like an Egyptian young-ish man and he came out looking like Refaat Ismael in a good day and if you're an Egyptian Millennial who doesn't know who Refaat Ismael is then I'm sorry that your life as teenager was magic free.",/review/rw5801003/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2019,random-70778,," More universal than you think
","Ramy is second generation (his parents are immigrants, he was born in the US). My parents were both second generation (Greek Americans).
Now there are of course elements of this story specific to Islam or the Middle East, but the core elements are actually not uncommon in the experiences of prior immigrants. Deep sexism, strong emphasis on education and then reaction to the anti-religiosity that occurs as people obtain higher levels of education, and then the conflict that occurs once one becomes agnostic due to the religion being such a core part of family imposed identity.",/review/rw5801003/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2020,henryshear,8," A Better Version of Atlanta!
","I was deeply surprised by how complex, intimate, and funny the show was. Ramy Youssef tackles issues such as religion, politics, and dating juxtaposed with hilarious topics such as teenage hormones, Tinder, and the use of his friends. Ramy is a struggling millennial trying to find his place and meaning in life. The show is very similar to Atlanta in numerous ways without all the drugs and rap. Not only that, but it is very emotional.",/review/rw5801003/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ramy Youseff's ""Ramy"" deals not only with the problems faced by the Muslim community, but also on the various neuroses common therein, much like how Philip Roth focused on the neuroses common in the Jewish community.
