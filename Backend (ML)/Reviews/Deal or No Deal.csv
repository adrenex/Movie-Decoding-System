22 November 2004,jordan2240,," From a Middle-of-the-Road Guy
","A little background on myself for some perspective: I'm a middle-aged Roman Catholic single father of three, who attends church regularly (a few times per month) and generally leans a bit toward the right. I'm certainly not fanatical, but am somewhat spiritual. And just to clear up any misconception, Catholicism is, in fact, a Christian religion.",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2004,ian23,8," Funny, Sharp and genuinely Sweet
","This film exceeded my already high expectations. The director and screenwriter have delivered an amazingly acute study of high school dialogue and interaction, while simultaneously exploring the polarizing landscape of evangelical Christianity in America and still delivering consistent laughs from start to finish.",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2004,anhedonia,7," Terrific first half, then loses its edge
","Despite losing its punch in the latter stages, ""Saved!"" remains an enjoyable and viciously funny satire. Poking fun of judgmental fundamentalists really isn't that tough a task or groundbreaking. They tend to spoof themselves. But what writers Brian Dannelly (who also directed) and Michael Urban do is not ridicule the fundamentalists' beliefs but their awful behavior. And that definitely deserves to be satirized.",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv

2 December 2004,mgoodst,9," Enjoyable, safe satire
","Not a bad movie for family consumption. Humorous and pushes its point home (that Christians should act like Christians and not bigots) without being too nasty. I watched with my wife and two high school daughters ... we all enjoyed it. Of course, if you're ""sophisticated"" you might sneer at this film -- but take it for what it is, a simple story with a talented young cast (the star, Jena Malone, is refreshing!), and you'll find it's worth the time spent to watch it and the money spent to rent it. If there's anything to criticize, it's the film's short length. They could have done much more with it in a longer format. However, that's a minor criticism. Overall the film is solid and enjoyable.",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2007,Rectangular_businessman,9," This movie isn't offensive to the religion and it's clever and well directed .
","I heard reviews like ""this is a movie for people that hate religion "". That isn't true, this movie doesn't mock of religion, this movie mocks of those fanatics that only use religion as a excuse to cover their intolerance. If you want to know ,I 'm catholic ,and I wasn't offended by this movie. Actually I find more offensive when the "" religious "" people use the Bible or the name of God for acts of intolerance and hate. When his name is used in a useless war of fanatics. Besides that,this movie makes a good combination of comedy and drama,and work very well. The performances are good,and even when many parts of the story have very much elements with teen movies ,it also offer a interesting story with many good points. And again ,this movie didn't make fun or attack the religion.",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2008,bkoganbing,9," Porcelain Goddess of the Virtue Police
",Some twenty years earlier the movie Heaven Help Us came out and it was to Catholic schools what Saved is to Protestant ones. Both were well received by the generations of movie goers who saw them in first run at theaters.,/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2005,super_smiley89,9," You don't have to be down with G-O-D to know Saved is hilarious!

15 November 2004,kdillman,," A good wake up call for the evangelical church
","I recall the controversy surrounding Saved when it came out earlier this year, especially from the evangelical church, conservatives and fundamentalists. I wanted to judge for myself its merits, or lack there of, since I've been an evangelical for 30+ years. I felt the movie did exactly what it intended to do; bring to light the hypocrisy of the church. I don't see how anybody, Christian or non-Christian could miss the message. I thought the selection of actors and actresses for the cast was right on, with each doing a very good job of portraying the personality of their characters well. I'm sure the movie was particularly biting to many evangelicals, as it should be--it even 'stung' me in a few places. I could see how evangelicals and conservatives would be outraged. However, the one thing I was especially struck by was the fact that this movie was written by non-Christians. As I watched all the 'digs' on Christians and the points of the evident hypocrisy within the church and Christianity, I came to a conclusion; if this movie was written by a non-Christian, then obviously there is a significant segment of our culture who believe the 'church' really is like this. If anything should move we evangelicals to start living lives of authenticity that reflect the love and grace of Jesus, this movie was it!",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2005,Bungle-9,7," Decent film that pansies out a little at the end
","I saw the trailers for this movie a looooong time ago and was very interested to see it, though I never got around to it. Now I've finally watched it and I'm happy that I did. In my view, this is essentially a movie about some of the issues with fundamentalism - it's not a complete panning of the Christian faith at all, let's get that straight!",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv

23 November 2006,chiat-1,10," funny with a very good message
","Before I saw this movie everyone said it was making fun of Christians. I didn't see why this was so bad, there have been many movies making fun of Jewish and Indian people and no one said a word, so I watched the movie. What I saw was not offensive to Christians at all! It was a touching story about taking religion too seriously and I don't think it was specifically aimed at Christians. This movie is one of the best ever made! It was hilarious, but it had a very good message. I loved Mandy Moore as the ""perfect"" Christian girl! The rest of the actors and actresses were excellent too. See this movie if you are in the mood for something lighthearted or if you like movies with good messages. I think this is a movie that everyone should see, no matter what religion you are.",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2006,moonspinner55,5," Some tart religious satire can't overcome cheap gags and the usual boy-girl antics...
","Jena Malone has a sweet plainness and a natural, unforced charm playing bright senior at ""a really good Christian school"" who's part of an elite clique until a series of confounding personal events causes her to question her faith--and reexamine her circle of friends. Director/co-screenwriter Brian Dannelly doesn't have the ear for transcribing teenagers' speech or behavior, though he does a little bit better by the adults, and Mary Louise Parker (as Malone's mother) ends up with the film's best lines and strongest scenes. In sending up the religious teen scene, Dannelly falls back too easily on familiarity or corny obviousness, yet he also wants to be sympathetic towards his characters, a symptom which usually brings out the worst in any screenwriter. The finale, at the senior prom, is full of platitudes and the inevitable pleading for tolerance, all of which do not play. This is in context, and that's fine, but what happened to the humor? ** from ****",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2005,TheOtherFool,5," Interesting in many ways
","After watching 'Saved', a rather unfamiliar satire of Christianity crossed with a high-school comedy/drama, I found myself rather puzzled of the intentions of the makers and the meaning of this movie. When reading some of the external reviews presented, I found both the point of Rogert Ebert as well as James Berardinelli interesting, meaningful, and true in it's own merit.",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2008,mbworm,7," Mandy Moore is a Revelation and ""Saved!"" is Hilarious
","Jena Malone is perfect as Mary, the girl who attends American Eagle Christian School with the perfect posse and perfect boyfriend Dean. Except her whole life begins to unravel when Dean confesses that he's gay. After she has a vision of Jesus underwater (when she hits her head on the ladder in her pool), she believes that her mission is to save Dean and in doing so she loses her virginity to him. After Dean's parents discover he is gay, they send him to ""Mercy House"" and Mary is left alone.",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2004,ScottDMenzel,9," A funny, smart, witty, near perfect film with a lot of heart and spunk!
","Needless to say, I have been anxiously awaiting the release of Saved to open in theaters. Due to MGM being worried about the controversy this film will stir up, Saved was moved from its April release date to Memorial Day weekend. I however was lucky enough to find out that Saved was premiering at the Newport Beach Film Festival and needless to say I was determined to go and so I did!",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv

","One would never expect anything but kindness from Hilary Faith, the leader of the pack in an evangelical school that tries to teach the young people about a better way of life. Yet, Hilary Faith, is anything but kind toward Mary, or for that matter, anyone who dares to challenge her authority and leadership. ",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2005,hokeybutt,6," Good movie for Christians and non-Christians alike!
","SAVED! (3 outta 5 stars) Better than average teen comedy about a modern-day Christian high school. Mary, a young student (Jena Malone) has a vision of Jesus after a near death experience which tells her that she must give herself to her boyfriend to ""cure"" him of his homosexuality. Well, he gets shipped off to a re-programming camp anyway... but while he's gone Mary finds out that she is pregnant. She can't really tell her best friend (the overly-devout Hillary Faye, nicely played by pop star Mandy Malone)... but does begin to develop a friendship with ""bad girl"" Cassandra (Eva Amurri) and her wheelchair-bound boyfriend (Macauley Culkin, who would have ever thought that *he* would appear in a *good* movie?) Mary tries to hide the pregnancy as long as she can... at least until the school year ends. In the meantime, her mom (Mary Louise Parker) is having ""meetings"" with the ""hip"" Pastor Skip (Martin Donovan) who runs the school, talking to the kids in a whitebread rap style (""Are you down with G-O-D? Jesus is in the house!"") There are some really funny lines in this movie... but the movie never really gets silly. The characters are developed as real people and are not just stereotypes put in there for the sake of a gag. The ending kind of wraps up everything into too neat of a bundle... but the movie as a whole winds up being both funny and thought-provoking... for Christians and non-Christians alike. Best line: ""There's only one reason Christian girls come down to Planned Parenthood..."" ""She's planting a PIPE BOMB???""",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2004,cshiroma08,10," Great Movie
","This movie was fantastic. For those who have ever attended a Christian school, this hits all of the daily ironies that made those four years interesting. If you never have been in a Christian school, it adds a unique portrayal of the rigid nature of religion while confronting current controversial issues. I saw for the first time in the theater and could not stop laughing, so much so I had to buy it the minute it came out. One of my absolute favorite things about this movie was seeing the actors and actresses play roles contrary to their usual choices. Mandy Moore is superb and truly understands the role of Hillary Faye. I love this movie and recommend to anyone that can handle new forms of humor.",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2020,DrCharlesMontague,10," I'm faithful and I loved it!
","I consider myself faithful, decent, and relatively traditional when it comes to faith and such issues, but this movie spoke to me because I had one little group of friends who were always downright judgmental and frequently made me feel like I wasn't Christian enough for them. Boy did they hate this movie too.",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2006,Tecun_Uman,1," Kind of boring and without a real point
","I am not sure I understand what the point of this movie was, other than to mock Christianity. I mean, the ""cool"" anti-heroes"" that spend all of their time rejecting Christianity are pretty unlikable themselves. Then we have the George Bush Christians that are equally unlikable. Every once in awhile, we get a brief glance at some other supporting characters that don't seem to have any real defined role in the movie. I have to be honest, I got bored. I am certainly not a Super Christain, so I am not going to condemn the film for being anti-religion, even though it is. However, I am not going to embrace the three rebels in this film that seem to stand for nothing or believe in anything. It is a rather empty film that attempts to parody the zealots that we find so often in America, but not make any real point beyond that.",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2006,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," ""I am filled with Christ's love!""-LOL!
","I have heard a lot about ""Saved"", for the most part they were really good reviews and also it was the rebirth of Mac Culkin's career. But I am not huge on Mandy Moore's acting, so I hesitated, but was willing to see what the hype was about.",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2006,claudio_carvalho,8," Delightful and Sharp Tale of Friendship, Love, Tolerance, Fanaticism for Religion and Hypocrisy
","In a Christian school, the fanatic and wealthy Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore) and Mary (Jena Malone) are best friends. Their friendship ends when Mary gets pregnant, after having sex with her gay boy-friend trying to ""save"" him, and questions Jesus' will. Meanwhile, the rebel Jewish Cassandra (Eva Amurri) dates Hillary's brother, the crippled Roland (Macaulay Culkin), and together with the newcomer son of the local pastor, Patrick (Patrick Fugit), they become the new friends of Mary, supporting her situation.",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv

","A young friend (she's in her 20s, I'm in my 40s) recommended this movie, so I added it to my NetFlix queue. I should know better than to take the recommendations of a 20-something! She found this movie meaningful (I think); I, however, found it really superficial and lightweight.",/review/rw1314992/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2006,colettesplace,7," a satire that treats its subjects with respect
