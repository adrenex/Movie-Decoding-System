","Really happy to see an old school type of mystery movie where we can watch with our kids. Nothing horrific or adult rated or other bad scenes, which is hard to find these days. Thanks! After watching this we already added all the next parts of the mystery movie to our family movie night list! =)",/review/rw8736379/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2023,haroot_azarian,," My pathology or take
","So I just spent two days watching the whole nine episodes of this Hallmark murder-mystery mini-series. And here is my take:
1 - With the amount of scenes throughout the 9 episodes where Finch and Hailey were either drinking or eating junk food, I was quite surprised that neither of them developed. Cardiovascular disease!!! These scenes just reached a point of annoyance to be honest.",/review/rw8736379/?ref_=tt_urv

","In Hallmark movies and TV shows, there is a tragic and unnecessary epidemic of fake eating. You know what I mean: actors having something delicious in front of them. They bring it right up to the tip of their mouth, are about to partake, and then boom, the director cuts to the next camera and somehow the actor has magically finished!",/review/rw8736379/?ref_=tt_urv
