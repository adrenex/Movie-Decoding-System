3 September 2020,sas2014,8," Mary saves people should be the name of this show
","As an avid supporter of assisted suicide, I believe as I am in charge of my life, I should be in charge of my own death. I wish in reality we had freedom to die without pain & surrounded with people we love. Not in agony in cold hospitals",/review/rw6607873/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2017,Michelle-imdb,10," You won't be Killed
","But you will enjoy a creative script, identifiable characters with really good acting. The Canadians have delivered another gem in this 6 episode series. This is really worth watching, there is a start and a finish to the entire story which will take you beyond straight drama to the edge of a thriller. The plot includes end of life situations, yet it is quite believable. This is not your usual police/detective TV show. If you accept end of life with assistance then you are more likely to agree with my praise for this show. I'll make this short and say thank you, it was an enjoyable ride, well done all concerned.",/review/rw6607873/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2017,katieintoronto,," Two doctors moonlight as angels of death.
","So far only the first episode is out, so this is based on that only. I don't know if I like this show or not. It's an interesting premise and the title character, Mary, seems to have a backstory that led her to what she's doing. What she's doing is helping terminal patients die by choice. She's an ER doctor by day, heroically saving lives. Her partner is referred to as a ""former plastic surgeon"", suggesting a past that didn't go so well. He also seems to have been an addict - they get the drugs they use to kill their terminal patients from his former dealer, who is suspicious as to what he's doing with the drugs. The plot gets more complicated when we discover that a patient Mary goes to visit is actually an undercover cop who is working on a sting to put her away. Oh, and her kids have discovered her stash of drugs. That's all in the first episode. There's the potential of good secondary plots that explain or elaborate on the story line. Some nice tensions. The actors are good, suit the parts. I just don't think I like them very much. There's no sense of altruism about what the doctors are doing - just money. Except...she starts to talk to the cop but then the conversation doesn't go anywhere. Maybe it'll come out a bit at a time. I'll watch again. There's definitely potential. But I'm still undecided if it's a keeper.",/review/rw6607873/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2017,annasirmoglou,10," Great premise, original and good fun!
","I really enjoyed the first episode, it has great potential original script, great premise to explore and even though it deals with assisted death it is not depressing - there is a great blend of darkness with humour. Stellar acting from all involved, especially Jay Ryan, Caroline Dhavernas and Richard Short and it left me wanting more. The characters are all multilayered and believable and it has got great pace throughout. I cant wait to see what happens next and I cant see how the characters will develop and whether their viewpoints will shift as the episodes progress. If you want to watch a show that is original, fresh with amazing acting and well written check this one out",/review/rw6607873/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2017,pontram,," Mary Kills her Potential
","First, there is an accuracy problem: Euthanasia on demand - which would be the right term for the procedure which this show is about - is not ""allowed"" in Switzerland, but actually in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. It's a common error that people believe, one could have ended his or hers life happily in Switzerland for a fee. That is not the case. Assisted suicide, however, without any financial interests, doesn't fall under jurisdiction there, but also not in Germany, ",/review/rw6607873/?ref_=tt_urv

14 July 2018,skay_baltimore,2," Coulda...shoulda...woulda...
","Wasn't. Wow. This show could have been SO MUCH better than it was. It SHOULD have been so much better than it was. It had the potential to eclipse Dexter because revenge/justice wasn't what drove it; mercy was what drove it. Or should have driven it. Instead, as other reviewers have pointed out, it devolved into the most absurd non-believable soap opera ever. This series has more stupidity than a non-stop weekend run of slasher movies. The story arc with Ben was laughably stupid. The same with Des. The same with Grady. The same with Olivia. And Annie. And...and...and. What a total waste considering how great this show could/should/would have been had it been in the hands of skillful producers, writers, and directors.",/review/rw6607873/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2017,leykaa,10," Finally excellent show about the Death not killing
","First of all it's not even trying to compete with Dexter, I saw many viewers accuse it of. This is one of the most good-written, well-executed series for family watch. Yes, we all need a dose of compassion, trust, real people connections cause all this gore and violence and senseless killing on TV should honestly be taken off the shelves, killing for shock value is the worst, piles of dead bodies shouldn't be our ordinary TV show premise. Mary Kills People is about death not killing, more of Bryan Fuller's approach to it. You are moved so much by some of the scenes so much and you want to rewatch this gem again. I just loved it as a fan of Caroline and Bryan Fuller although he has nothing to do with MKP (:",/review/rw6607873/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2019,audaciousness,5," Seasons 1&2- YES! Season 3 - NO!
","I have to admit, I wasn't super into Mary Kills People during its first season. It was good, but it always felt like it was missing something. That all changed with Season 2, which got everything right by introducing the fantastically villainous character of Olivia Bloom played by the wonderful Rachelle Lefevre. I loved every episode of it. I had high hopes for Season 3 as a result, but I couldn't have been more disappointed by it. It turned into a very weak, plotless mess that went nowhere in six episodes and did nothing for the characters. A disappointing to have ended an otherwise good show.",/review/rw6607873/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2017,seremarti,9," characters personal journey
","What I like the most about this show is that it is focused on characters and their personal journey that brings them to judge assisted suicide in different way. And that's a plus because it is not another medical drama or crime show, we have plenty of that and most focused on theme. Even from the first episode we can see that characters' life is not linear, their behavior is conditioned by their past, while present and emotions are something they had to deal with in the meanwhile. Well casted, all actors are able to show characters' strengths and weaknesses, with a bit of humor that mitigate very intense moments.",/review/rw6607873/?ref_=tt_urv

10 April 2017,cathlin-07754,7," Doctor medically assists suicides for terminally ill ~
","I really liked the show, and was pleased that the cast was diverse, but truly believed in the right of the terminally ill to die with dignity and/or end their suffering. Much as I appreciated the varied characters, I found the detectives roles a bit ""Keystone Cops"" for me. I'd have to believe they'd have better information and background on their suspects, that they wouldn't be so obvious and seemingly bumbling. Question: why didn't her daughter, upon seeing her cat at her aunt's house, not question her mother?? The cat was supposed to be dead. I'm pretty sure a teenager, especially when she's already stumbled upon her mother's euthanasia drugs, would have pressed the issue. Regardless, I kept watched every episode and had to root for Mary and her cohorts. I've witnessed people suffer at the end of life, and it's terrible and cruel. If one is not mentally incompetent, I believe one should have the right to choose to NOT suffer. Suspense and a real life issue.",/review/rw6607873/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2017,drjgardner,6," Entertainment Trumps Reality
","It's a good thing to have a controversial and topical subject on TV, and even better if it's entertaining. So Kudos to Mary Kills People which deals with assisted suicide. The ER doctor played by Caroline Dhavernas does a marvelous job transmitting the mixed feelings when a physician considers such an enterprise. For some reason Dhavernas keeps getting medical roles (""Off the Map"", ""Hannibal"") but the truth is she far too beautiful to be a physician – who would ever stop being sick if they got to have an exam from her?",/review/rw6607873/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2017,RagnorFell89,3," Too much Sloapy Soap stuff over meaningful assisted suicide drama
","Mary kills people started out with potential. The Pilot episode held promis as the new show about Female Kevorkian.And it looked like it had something to offer about a provocative real assisted suicide issues in real life. However, it Very Quickly changed it's tone from that, and became your usual soapy drama involving doctors, cops, and drug dealers. Such a missed opportunity. The writers could acctualy created interesting meaningful drama over the show's subject but chose to go to shonda rhimes's sloapy soap drama.It really showed that the writers haven't done actual learning/research regarding this spesific issues. It got murky around the middle, the cop stuff was embarrassing, the euthanasia issue and it's complication got totally wasted with an ending that any viewer could see way before the last episode.",/review/rw6607873/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2017,frockie-545-343990,10," When life get messed up we get stronger
","A twenty-first-century woman, mother, family helm in her hands; established at work, responsibilities burdening on her too often, plus a deeper dimension, more personal and thoroughly less shareable in which she needs to move following her values, her sense of ethics, her need for answers. The magic touch, the sign of the uniqueness and value of this series created, written, produced and directed by women, is maybe the authenticity of Mary since the first frames and in every single moment of this premiere, her daily routine narrated with priceless candor. Mary is not perfect, in fact quite messy. Mary is not invulnerable and doesn't even try to fight against her weakness. Mary is not emotionless, a whirlwind of feelings simmering far beneath the surface of her apparent control. In this dynamic premiere, serious and funny at one time, viewers are thrown into the middle of this woman's life, while she admirably unravels between her family, daughters and ex -good in his mood and maybe in his intentions, but rather inconclusive, with his compliance as a choice to escape responsibilities – and work, in fact, the works.",/review/rw6607873/?ref_=tt_urv

22 February 2017,questiontheauthorities,1," Dexter fans should avoid this catchy title.
","It's pretty sad that the only ideas Hollywood can come up with, are politically correct versions of the best ideas from the past 10 years. And then on top of making it too tame for the fans of the orig they're all based on, they lace it with anti white anti male subtext, to pander to the crybabies who are at home watching television to escape the reality that political correctness being the basis of all decision making is bad for business.",/review/rw6607873/?ref_=tt_urv

","I get the fact that they are plastic surgeons and end of life care might not be their strong suit, but smothering a patient is not assisted suicide, it's murder and any doctor, or simpleton would not smother someone because you've cocked up a euthanasia.

","I made it halfway through episode two when I had had enough. There's just nothing likable about Mary. She's a sociopath from what I can see. She kills people under the guise of doing them a favor. And maybe she is, but she's still murdering people. Her coldness was put in a nutshell when she let her young daughter believe her cat was dead just to hide what she's doing.
