13 November 2021,gsygsy,9," the freedom to love
","Most prison movies do not ackowledge the fact of same-sex love. Most prison movies go out of their way to ignore it. There are exceptions, such as Fortune and Men's Eyes (1971), Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985), and the jail episode of Todd Haynes' portmanteau work Poison (1991). Grosse Freiheit rises above all of these by dint of its complete absence of sentimentality, the power of its performances, its complex but clearly-told time-frame, and its commitment to effectively portraying love in the hearts of otherwise lost souls. It carefully weaves imagery that would not be out of place in a novel into the story of Germany's incessant persecution of homosexual men, which only stopped when the hated paragraph 175 of the German Penal Code was reformed in 1969.",/review/rw8378092/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2021,thebeachlife,10," Human Heart
","For two hours I chose to sit through incessant violence, injustice, humiliation, most horrible expressions of human weakness in order to see the gem of a human soul. I would refer to this one as genocide-themed or even the Holocaust but there's so much more to it. Despite the obvious background, it is all about endurance, fearlessness and as simple as it is: a Human Heart.",/review/rw8378092/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,Mengedegna,9," Be True to Yourself. No compromises.
","In 1980 Frank Ripploh gave us ""Taxi zum klo"", a raunchy, rather self-satisfied (albeit slightly mocking) look at the gay scene in Berlin of that time, with a singular focus on the bulimic sexual doings of Ripploh, playing himself as one of its committed denizens. With his terrific Austro-German ""Great Freedom"", Sebatian Meiser takes us back to that period and to all that had gone before and gives a corrective, eschewing all the clichés about gay life, prison life, German life, or just-plain life and love that you can think of. Freedom, he seems to be telling us, comes from within and must be conquered individually, against the massive odds that society puts up against it. Toward the end of this new film, we are given a glimpse of the pseudo-freedom in which Ripploh gloried. Meiser tells us that this Great Freedom is not the real thing at all, and that affirming your sexuality alone, without an understanding of your whole self and the constraints of the world you live in, is meaningless.",/review/rw8378092/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,riccardomorarm,9," Be Gay, Do Crime
","""Große Freiheit"" must become a cult. Because of the great performances of all the actors, and the extraordinary performance of Franz Rogowski. Because of the deeply moving and tender stories of love and friendship it is about. Because of the historical accuracy with which the system of oppression against homosexual people in Germany is described, a system that survived unaltered from the Nazi regime to post-war Germany until the abolition of infamous law 175 in 1973. Because of the force with which the existential condition of prisoners is portrayed, as well as that of outcasts of society, a force that finds its equal and source in Genet and in Fassbinder, among many others. Because it is a cry for help, and a cry for justice at the same time, because it shows pain and endurance, violence and strength, dispair and its antidote - the wondrous human ability to feel compassion.",/review/rw8378092/?ref_=tt_urv

","The movie ""Great Freedom"" emphasizes how a simple paragraph of the German Criminal Code punished same-sex relationships for more than a century in Germany. Director and writer Sebastian Meise purposely place two incarcerated individuals in the same prison cell for a certain period of time: one for being a criminal and the other just for being homosexual. Two marginalized characters who accept their fates and the bitterness of their lives.",/review/rw8378092/?ref_=tt_urv

15 April 2022,Horst_In_Translation,6," ""Great"" not quite
","""Große Freiheit"" or ""Great Freedom"" is a co-production between Austria and Germany from 2021 and this film is almost exclusively in the German language. I think you can say that this is more of an Austrian than a German film, even if the (bigger) lead actor is German. The director and writer is Sebastian Meise and he is from Austria and turned 45 when this came out. Not the most prolific filmmaker, so maybe this explains why he got help from Thomas Reider with the screenplay. Reider (not Tvix) has worked on a bigger amount of projects in the past. For Meise, this was only his third full feature project apparently after some short film works and it is definitely his by far most famous work. I am not entirely sure, but I think this was Austria's Oscar submission too, but did not make the cut. Where it had huge success was the renowned film festival in Cannes. Palme d'Or. You can check for yourself for the awards it won and for which it was nominated. The film runs for almost two hours and it is a prison drama pretty much from beginning to end. At the very end, the action takes place outside of jail, but it is just a temporary state as we know what is going to happen next when the closing credits roll in. Right back to jail that is. But I am too deep into the story already. Let's look at some of the basics first: Franz Rogowski plays the central character here and he is a character that has turned into one of Germany's most known and most successful non-mainstream actors in recent years. I like him. The other major player in here is Georg Friedrich, an Austrian actor and you can make a case for both possibilities that he either plays the by far biggest supporting character or a co-lead even. It is not too important how you see it. What matters is that he is as good as he always is. He shines particularly towards the end when there is more focus on the man's drug addiction. I just like him as an actor, no matter what he is in and he is really versatile and this is just another good film in his body of work.",/review/rw8378092/?ref_=tt_urv

18 April 2022,mmjurema,9," Beautiful, emotional queer movie
",It's really quite rare that a queer romance movie is really done well. I just enjoy seeing queer love represented so well and I also felt like I learned something from this movie. It is not usually talked about how persecuted gay people have been and in most places still really are. This movie really beautiful!! The acting is heartbreaking and beautiful. I saw it in a theater and I can't wait to hopefully see it again and to own it soon.,/review/rw8378092/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2022,flikeyb,7," An existance as a revolution
","Great Freedom.takes place in the post war era, after the second world war till the late 60's, after the May of 1968. It begins with Hans, the main character which is being uniquely performed by Franz Rogowski, staying in a correctional institution during the year of 1968 without any kind of privacy (his love life is being recorded and that love life has been defined as a criminal offence). It is a fictional story including a documentary style, exploring the different years in the life of Hans. We see him in concentration camps and correctional institutions, not in a.yearly way but in a way that gives answers about his situation in 1968 while something else had happened in 1945. He falls in love, he changes his style, he finds small doses of freedom and ways to live.",/review/rw8378092/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2022,kmoska,9," Low-profile story on tragedy and hope of the human condition
",This superbly made prison movie is one of the few that put homosexuality in the epicentre. Great Freedom centers around the postwar life path of a German homosexual which more often than not leads him to incarceration whenever he exercises his Freedom of choice.

16 June 2022,cahidi,6," Not-So-Great Freedom
","A bitter and painful story about being gay in an intolerant time. The pain and bitterness I can endure, but not the slowness. The movie was stretched for too long. So many unnecessary scenes which can be summarized in 10 minutes. Also there was no strong chemistry between Hans and the teacher. I don't know if that's the actors fault or the director's. Bottom line, there's much room for improvements in this movie. I don't really like this drama. I gave it 6 for the historical aspect.",/review/rw8378092/?ref_=tt_urv

1 May 2022,him090296,," Great Freedom
","Objective Rating: This movie is very good. I found that this film portrays the theme of gay prisons in post-Nazi Germany very well before Paragraph 175 was deleted. This film may of course be included in the list of other popular gay-themed films. Alas, in my personal opinion: The fictional story of this film bothers me a lot. At first I confused the chronology of this movie to understand what moment we are in. The next biggest obstacle is the scene asking for oral sex, which I think lacks motivation. I mean, he was just curious and wanted to try. Because we didn't showed enough sexual attraction. Lastly when the ending of this film somehow feels ironically hopeless (the great freedom he finally found after they abolished Paragraph 175 was having to go back to that prison), I doubt it will become a cult. Still, I like the optimistic side of the expressionless Hans Hoffman character's desperate expression. Such a good mood, fearless and moving.",/review/rw8378092/?ref_=tt_urv
