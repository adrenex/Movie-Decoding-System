17 February 2022,southdavid,5," Oats so simple.
","Usually, with a collection show like this, I'd review each one individually, but this odd collection, from Neill Blomkamp's independent studio is too esoteric and, in most cases, short to justify that sort of approach. So I'll review them as one.",/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2022,javier_8,6," Ok, I don't want to be harsh, because it's independent, but...
","First of all, almost all episodes are inconclusive, and that was the point, to raise funds to develop them, and that's ok. It has some good stuff in it, Firebase is really good, I wish I could see the ending of that. Same with Rakka. There are some good ideas. Zygote and Gdansk are interesting.",/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2022,gabycs11,4," The first two
","Those two first episodes are good even great. The rest is only bad acting, very bad storytelling and horrible sound effects.",/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,jabandrade,5," Where were they going with this?
","I rated 5.0 for the show and 7,0 just for the first episode, which would even deserve a particular material. The rest is hard to watch. Just with a lot of good will. All very confusing, inconsistent, irregular and without clear objectives .",/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2022,cjpalmer-53855,3," Had a few good ideas, then they needed to finish a season
","I didn't see any reviews or recommendations for this show before stumbling upon it in my netflix browse. Upon the first two episodes I thought I had stumbled upon a hidden gem. The first two episodes are really great, good effects, average to decent acting, somewhat thought provoking, and which each episode being different they didn't need to deal with complex character growth.",/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2022,nillbass,2," If the intention is being bad at story telling...
",... they were successful.,/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,Swooping_Owl,5," Black Mirror With A Dash Of Love, Death & Robots
","For being an independent studio the quality of CGI/animation is actually decent. It didn't make me cringe looking at it. The acting was good. It had a few famous people, but for the most part unknown actors. Some stories were moronic and tried to hard, others were solid story telling with inconclusive endings. All in all, this felt like a wannabe Black Mirror and Love, Death & Robots mash up.",/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,marcellszabolfgeb,8," Visually amazing, but showing it as a series on Netflix is confusing.
","All of these short films have amazing visuals, great directing and acting. Some of these story ideas are indeed likely to be similar to something you have already seen in other movies or series, but it still manages to take a new approach on a lot of these themes and subjects.",/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2022,kerryjohnreynolds,1," No point
","If you like movies that end with no conclusion, you might like these experimental shorts that end with no plot or conclusion. Double the value!",/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2021,lairobell,8," Compendium
","Nice selection of sci-fi and fantasy shorts. Would love to see some of them expanded upon. I especially like the God episodes, very amusing, the Vietnam episode and the very short Gdansk.",/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2022,UltraMaximal,2," Shockingly Unoriginal
",There isn't a single installment of this that has any originality. From begining to end these are rehashed stories and ideas from other tv series or movies. It's a real shame. I think Neil Blomkamp has run his course.,/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2022,ajbeardow,2," Mainly mindless, shallow and lazy body horror
","Here's what happens when you spend all your budget on special effects and props, and realise you have nothing left for scriptwriting. It's quite blatant body horror, somewhat well done, thinly veiled as something deeper. What's worse, is some of the stellar acting performances for such poor writing.",/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2022,Evrnyldrm,9," Originality
",He needs to make new sci-fi movies with better budgets like D9 and Chappie. This series alone demonstrates his capacity for originality and intensity which are rare qualities for a sci-fi movie these days.,/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2021,grad124,2," Absolute garbage
",Nonsense. I don't even know why I bothered to watch it but about five episodes in I had to start skipping through entire scenes. This has to be 150 characters.,/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2022,gianmarcoronconi,9," Small pearl
","Small pearl of its kind, this series offers really beautiful and inspired episodes and some a little more poor but still watchable. The series looks very good also thanks to the gigantic variety of themes between one episode and another.",/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2022,kaeseapfel,1," When you order ""Love, Death & Robots"" on Wish
","Honestly, it feels like a very cheap knock-off. If it at least had the charm or the very well executed animation/CGI going on...",/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2022,olivermarchant,5," Black mirror but worse
","I imagine the creator of this show was watching black mirror. They must have thought 'I can do this but worse', it's an entertaining watch to fill an awkward amount of time but nothing massively thought provoking or well thought out.",/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2022,chriswjoiner,3," Cheap & cheesy
","Low budget, poor writing, no continuity at all. Each episode is just 20 minutes or so and has zero connection to any of the others. If you have a short attention span this might be your thing, but it doesn't work for me.",/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2022,danielpiil,9," Absolute great
","Excellent. Horror and sf from the curly mind of Blomkamp. You must be prepared for a few twisted scenes, but also a lot of good fun. I particularly like the episodes God, Firebase and Zygote. Recommended.",/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2022,superrudike,9," Interesting try-outs
","I found these try-outs to be very interesting. Some of them were actually quite good, some of them (cooking, president) were not so great. But is that not the purpose of trying things out? Better to do it this way than to make a complete season that sucks.",/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2022,mrrebel-80382,1," can't give zero
","I have no idea what this crap is.. minutes wasted. Zero and I mean zero entertainment, just one episode after another of stupidity.i truly do not understand this nonsense, other than killing off any good brain cells left.",/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2022,Nix_Ravi,4," The fast food of experimental sci-fi.
","Great for when you want turn off your brain for a while. Some people will really enjoy this, but I prefer something with a bit more meat.",/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2022,samjstewart,8," Interesting....
",So I have been watching oats studio and I can't turn it off even though some of the shorts frustrate me because they are too short an I want to see more. My rating is on the basis that a lot of them are rather good an hope they actually will do something with them.,/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,deco-11077,2," Incomplete stories
",French ending all the time. It doesn't provide a conclusion. All stories get interrupted. Bad storytelling. Some effects. CGI sometimes is videogame-like. Could be better.,/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2022,RachelMary2,9," Enjoyed it!
","I haven't got the foggiest clue what I was watching but it was good stuff. I'm not even sure it was meant to make coherent sense and I do like TV with sense- but these are only little shorts a few minutes long so I could go along with it. I found it refreshing, not having to invest hours and hours to get into a story but get a glimpse into someone else's imagination.",/review/rw8571230/?ref_=tt_urv
