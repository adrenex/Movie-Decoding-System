","The day after Rev Parris finds his daughter and niece dancing in a group in the forest, several of the girls in the village are deep in sleep unable to be wakened. Rev Hale is called in to investigate and Abby Williams speaks up claiming witchcraft and that she and the other girls had been brought into it by the devil himself. As the investigation continues, Abby leads the claims on a twisted vendetta, eventually ending at the door of John Proctor and his family, the man she had an affair with and still loves.",/review/rw6843617/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2002,dee.reid,10," Not just a dynamic character study, but a study of madness. **** (out of four)
","For my eleventh grade English class, I have just finished reading ""The Crucible"" and have also finished watching the movie adaptation.  ""The Crucible"" which was written by Arthur Miller, is a shocking look into the events of a tragic period early in history that America will not likely forget.  The setting of ""The Crucible"" is that it takes place in the Puritan community of Salem, Massachusetts in 1692.  The story revolves around the hysteria caused by the Salem Witch Trials.  John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis), the story's protagonist (or should I say antagonist?), is facing a little bit of a moral dilemma.  It turns out that Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder), Proctor's former servant girl and mistress, along with several other young girls, were caught out in the woods dancing.  Apparently, from the evidence, Witchcraft was taking place.  John's wife, Elizabeth (Joan Allen), is suffering because of his lechery, but deep down thinks that she may be partially responsible.  Reverend Parris (Bruce Davison) calls for Reverend Hale (Rob Campbell), a renowned pastor (and self-proclaimed paranormal expert) to come to Salem to investigate the accusations.",/review/rw6843617/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2007,dead47548,10," One of the finest plays in history is turned into a cinematic masterpiece.
","One of the finest plays in history is remarkably turned into one of the finest masterpieces of the '90s. Arthur Miller's original story is one of power and the terrible nature of society on two fronts. First, it tackles the inner struggle of a morally strong man who's emotions get the better of him and the girl who will do anything to have him be her's forever. Secondly, it displays the flaws of the government and society in general, and how one person's claim can corrupt an entire town. It's a stunning take on the foolishness and utterly unbelievable nature of a topic that dates back to the Salem Witch Trials, McCarthyism and is even poignant today in terms of the War on Terror.",/review/rw6843617/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2012,ironhorse_iv,7," Wicked movie
","The settling is 17th Century Salem, Massachusetts. A group of spoil teenage girls fearing in getting in trouble for meeting in the woods at midnight for a secret love-conjuring ceremony where the town minister mistook it as witchcraft. Instead of love, psychopath Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) wishes for the death of her former lover's John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis) wife. The girls are accused of witchcraft, but to save themselves they accused others. Soon the entire village is consumed by hysteria, and innocent victims are put on trial, leading to a accusations flying, judgments are pronounced, and sentences are quickly and ruthlessly carried out. The only person whom can save them is Mary Warren (Karron Graves). The Crucible isn't a pretty film, but Nicholas Hytner's grim movie version of the classic Arthur Miller concerning the Salem witch hunts is a tragedy and in some what could be also be called a horror/thriller movie. It explodes into a melodramatic but never less than gripping story between both John Proctor Vs Abigail Williams. Ryder is wicked insidious, as the angry, hysterical Abigail, caught up in a conspiracy of lies from which there's no escape looking for revenge against him. Daniel Day-Lewis gives us a stubborn yet vulnerable John Proctor. He gives one of the best lines in the film toward the end. Joan Allen delivers a heart-breaking performance as the anguished Elizabeth, a fervently religious woman unable to disprove the allegations made against her and her husband.it's pretty evident (if you read the book) that Elizabeth did forgive John Proctor. if she hadn't, she wouldn't have blamed herself partly for the affair. their relationship is very complex, but in the end she does forgive him. this draws on one of Miller's main themes of forgiveness. This story really shows how far people will go in their words and actions when they are motivated by blind fear. The Crucible was written as a thinly disguised attack on the McCarthy anti-communist Red Scare ""witch hunts"" of the 1950s America.! This is so dramatic and powerful my heart clenches every time I see this, so check it out.",/review/rw6843617/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2013,bkoganbing,10," The Elusive Crime Of Witchcraft
","Arthur Miller is gone now, but he lived long enough to see his master work The Crucible finally on the big screen. Back when it was on Broadway it was deemed too controversial in those paranoid days of the Fifties. The Crucible was Miller's answer to the witch hunting House Un-American Activities Committee and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee of Joe McCarthy. He saw parallels between the Salem Witch Trials where several people were put to death in that sad town for the elusive crime of witchcraft. Miller even got to adapt his work to the screen and did it so well that the stage origins aren't even noticeable.",/review/rw6843617/?ref_=tt_urv

","Sometimes, movies that are designated as ""classic"" suffer from a strange sort of reverse- discrimination. That's probably the reason why it took me so long to actually see this version of ""The Crucible"", as I thought of it as ""old"" or ""not exciting enough"". What I quickly discovered, however, is that Arthur Miller's tale here is truly one for the ages. It's a shame I waited this long to see it!",/review/rw6843617/?ref_=tt_urv

20 May 1999,Barnes-3,9," Just fantastic
","Based on possibly the greatest play ever written, The Crucible is a fabulous movie - it's hard to believe that it was actually distributed by 20th Century Fox, and not an independent company. Why it took so long to be adapted for the big screen is just baffling to me. Thank God that the genius behind the original text, Arthur Miller, was permitted to write the screenplay - and get an Oscar nomination for it! The cast are all to die for, with Winona Ryder proving she doesn't always have to play lovable characters like Charlotte Flax in Mermaids (1990), or Jo March in Little Women (1994) - her performance as the malicious Abigail Williams is just as outstanding. In her Oscar nominated portrayal of Elizabeth Proctor, Joan Allen leaves an indelible impression of marvellous acting. I was in tears in the scene where she and John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis) fall in love all over again. I sincerely hope that The Crucible will be shown in schools/colleges in years to come, to remind us of the horror that occurred in 17th century Salem. A work of cinematic genius.",/review/rw6843617/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2003,khatcher-2,7," excellent adaptation for the screen
","There is nothing I like better than a good play for the stage, even when it is on screen. This is the second time I have been able to see this worthy conversion of Arthur Miller's classic play adapted to the screen. Nicholas Hytner certainly earnt his wages; and all the cast should have received a good pay-rise. Convincing scene-setting in Massachussets at the end of the 17th Century with heavy wood-framed farm buildings and typical North European immigrant peasants' clothing, all beautifully filmed. Arthur Miller himself collaborated on the script, allowing certain poetic licence in modernising some of the speech forms, which, in the original play  written around 1952-1953  reflected speech patterns of the times.",/review/rw6843617/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 1999,lib-4,," What is truth?
",Thanks to the director who let Arthur Miller do the screenplay- so the movie is a honest rendition of the great play. Daniel Day Lewis is very good- and the movie is true to the original. Winona Rider also does well- but Joan Allen is excellent. This is a true classic of American Theater and since we can't always get to a live performance the movie is a good substitute... recommend every student of am. lit see it and anyone who wants to delve into the deceit of the human spirit... nothing is new people are still jealous and still vindictive and Miller writes of these two traits so well.  The whole cast does a credible job,/review/rw6843617/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2011,sddavis63,7," Sobering And Chaotic - In Keeping With The Subject Matter
","Arthur Miller wrote the play on which this movie was based in 1953. 1953 in the United States was the height of the Red Scare, with McCarthy and Nixon among others seeking to hunt down and destroy Communists - often with little or conflicting evidence, and often to the ruin of those accused on such flimsy evidence. Miller couldn't write a play depicting the abuses of the Communist witch-hunt, so he did the next best thing - he wrote a play based on the incident in American history that might be the closest thing to the Communist witch-hunts: the Salem Witch Trials of 1692, in which rumours led to suspicions, and personal jealousies and ambitions led to accusations and people lied about their neighbours and friends in order to deflect attention away from themselves and innocent people were forced to confess to witchcraft because if they denied it (no matter their innocence) they'd hang and the courts became less interested in discovering the truth than in rooting out the evil. It's actually quite a good parallel.",/review/rw6843617/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,planktonrules,7," Well made...unpleasant viewing.
","""The Crucible"" is based on a play written by Arthur Miller. His goal was not to present the Salem witch trials verbatim but to use it in order to attack the McCarthy hearing....and as such, he made a few changes here and there to the facts of the case. I mention all this so that you understand his motivations and occasionally the story does stray from the facts as we know them today.",/review/rw6843617/?ref_=tt_urv

3 November 2006,drownsoda90,8," Powerful Telling of the Salem Witch Trials.
","I had to watch this film as a part of my high school literature class, since we had just finished reading Arthur Miller's classic play. I thought the play was great, definitely one of the best I've read (although I haven't read too many), and was wondering what the film would be like. And I was blown away. The film centers around John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his wife, Elizabeth (Joan Allen), who find themselves immersed in the hysteria the grips the colonial town of Salem, Massachussets, when rumors of witchcraft and Devil worshipping break out. This hysteria is set off after a group of girls are found dancing naked in the woods at night, and drinking the blood from a sacrificed animal, obviously dabbling in some sort of black magic. Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) is a cruel, deceitful young woman who is the main accuser in the witch hunt, although she herself was actually part of the ritual herself, and begins pointing out innocent person by innocent person, soon accusing Elizabeth and John as a revenge tactic for her failed affair with the man.",/review/rw6843617/?ref_=tt_urv

","Powerful telling of Arthur Miller's revered play about the fearful witch hunt that took place in Salem, Massachussets in the late 17th century. Director Nicholas Hytner ensures the fanaticism and rabid superstition of the day is conveyed with force to the stunned audience, and I'm sure most will scarcely believe that a court of law could allow an accused person who pleads innocent to die, and one who confesses guilt (through threat of death) to live.",/review/rw6843617/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Crucible is a drama and a 1997 film adaptation of Arthur Miller's play of the same name. The play (and the movie, by extension) is set during the Salem Witch Trials and is an allegory for the Red Scare. Being a victim of the Red Scare, it's natural that this story was personal to Miller, and it really shows in how polished and well written the play and movie are. And before you misconceive anything, the movie was actually still written by Arther Miller and he basically adapts it very accurately.
