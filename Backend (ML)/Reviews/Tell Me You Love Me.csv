22 February 2001,FlickJunkie-2,7," Insubstantial but highly entertaining
","Producer Jerry Bruckheimer seems to have an innate sense of what makes money in cinema.  He seldom makes a film that isn't profitable and has numerous blockbusters on his resume over the past 30 years (American Gigolo, Flashdance, Beverly Hills Cop, Top Gun, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon). Bruckheimer is a populist producer.  He is more concerned with giving audiences what they want than he is about producing films of any artistic value or substance.  In that regard, `Coyote Ugly' fits right in.",/review/rw3044813/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2020,statuskuo,6," 20 Years Later Revisiting This
","After 20 years, I'd have to say...it doesn't hold up that well. BUT, that's not to say, it brings a tug of nostalgia for that era of Jerry Bruckheimer slick music video retreads of ""Flashdance""
A lot of it is due to Diane Warren's corny soundtrack music. And those of us who were in college by now, have a slight shiver when we hear her anthems. Which nearly toppled another Jerry Bruckheimer gem ""Con Air"" with ""How Do I Live Without You"" Oof.",/review/rw3044813/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2011,StevePulaski,5," When you don't know what to say, display for TnA, I guess
","The most clever scene in Coyote Ugly is when Maria Bello explains why the bar is named what it is. She says it's when a woman wakes up in bed with a man after a one night stand and he's so ugly, but you have your arm around him because last night he seemed hot. Desperate, but not wanting to be rude, instead of pulling your arm out from under him you try to chew it off like a trapped coyote. That my friends, is Coyote Ugly.",/review/rw3044813/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2004,shulma2002,," Coyote Ugly Was A ""Feel Good"" Film
","I was not disappointed with ""Coyote Ugly"". It made me feel good and we need this kind of film these days with all that's going-on.It was no worse than ""Flashdance"" or ""Footloose"" which also had little storyline and average acting. I enjoyed it and it was what I had expected.Many of you gave it negative criticisms; what did they expect from a film about a young girl coming to the city? This was a simple story about a young shy girl with dreams trying to make it in show business; which is hard if you don't have the right connections.The dance numbers and bar scene were very realistic. As a New Yorker, I was happy to see that she wasn't mugged or worse as many films about New York portray.I'd like a sequel.",/review/rw3044813/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2001,Bondo20,8," Heartwarming story overcomes sappy bits.
","Based on the true story about the crazy female run bar in New York City, Coyote Ugly becomes surprisingly believable despite the usual Hollywood bits.  The story follows Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) as she moves from small town New Jersey to the city to become a songwriter.  Through her misfortunes she meets boyfriend Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia) and the Coyotes and learns from each of them to overcome the stage fright that threatens to ruin her dreams.",/review/rw3044813/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2000,bopdog,8," Familiar story still has great energy, and works for me!!!
","Not bad, not bad. I read reviews that criticized the cliche-ness of this movie, and I can see their point. At times the plot made the characters a little bit annoying. But hey-- story cliches often become that way because they speak to universal ""truths,"" or at least things that interest bunches of people over of time.",/review/rw3044813/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2021,damianphelps,6," I Did Enjoy it...however

3 January 2006,simplysoda_19f,8," Coyote Ugly is the best bar-flick since Cocktail
","I love ""Coyote Ugly"", even though it seems critics/reviewers had mixed opinions. I thought it was the best bar-flick since ""Cocktail"". If you haven't seen ""Cocktail"", it's a movie where Tom Cruise stars as a bartender, and he swirls bottles around and other cool tricks of the trade. In Coyote Ugly, you have Violet (Piper Perabo) who comes to NYC to become a singer/songwriter. While Violet's there she finds that nobody will accept her demos, so she goes looking for work and she finds a job in a local bar called, ""Coyote Ugly"". The bar is owned by Lil (Maria Bello), Lil is a hardcore chick who treats her bar like it's her home. While Violet is there she also learns the tricks of the trade, and she also dances on top of the bar. I'm not going to tell you if Violet becomes a singer/songwriter or not, because that would wreck the movie, but I am going to tell you that this is a great movie. Personally, I would have to recommend this to anybody that has hopes and dreams of making it big. I'm giving this a 8 out of 10, because it has an amazing story, memorable characters and a lot of great lines, but I have to tell you one of the best parts is the theme song, ""Can't Fight The Moonlight"". So, if you love bar-flicks like ""Cocktail"" you'll love ""Coyote Ugly"".",/review/rw3044813/?ref_=tt_urv

10 July 2001,michaelRokeefe,7," Belly up to the bar and hang on.
","Violet Sanford(Piper Perabo)wants to avoid a dead end life and decides to leave New Jersey for the big city. In NYC, she is determined to be a hit song writer. In order to make ends meet, she takes a job slinging beer and dancing on the bar with the other ""Coyotes"" at the popular watering hole Coyote Ugly. This is very titilating and an eye full to watch. The trailers don't give you any hint of substance. Perabo is so easy to like. I could watch her for hours. Maria Bello, who plays the bar owner is impressive as well. Also in the cast: Adam Garcia, John Goodman, Melanie Lynskey, Izabella Miko, Bridget Moyhnahan and a cameo by LeAnn Rimes, who actually is the singing voice of Perabo's character. Besides the four songs by Rimes, the soundtrack is full of music by the likes of The Charlie Daniels Band, Lenny Kravitz, Def Leppard, Blondie and Elvis Presley. Order another round and enjoy. This is actually worth seeing more than once.",/review/rw3044813/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2016,TheLittleSongbird,3," Great soundtrack. The film? Not so much

1 January 2021,AngelHonesty,5," Eye Candy
","Not much to say about this one. The film is mostly about watching sexy girls dance on a table. Not much of a storyline, just enough to say the movie has a plot. The singing in the film is nice to listen to, but the movie is basically eye candy, the acting is shallow and sometimes cringe worthy. The plot and lines are predictable and clich√©. If you're looking to watch a B movie with hot girls basically pole dancing on a table then this is the film for you.",/review/rw3044813/?ref_=tt_urv

Only the big bad city is getting the best of her. Down to her last few dollars, she tries out for a surprising job at a bar called Coyote Ugly.",/review/rw3044813/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2006,Lady_Targaryen,7," Wanna dance? The hottest party of the year.
","There are something like 3 years since I watched ''Coyote Ugly'', but I remembered it of being a very nice movie! It was the first movie I watched with Piper Perabo and Bridget Moynahan.(who, by the way, is the same lady who works in ''I,Robot'' and I couldn't remember since she is so different!)We also have the famous John Goodman playing Violet's dad and Adam Garcia, who I already have watched in ''Riding in Cars with Boys ''. The story of this movie is very simple, and it's about a girl called Violet from New Jersey,who wants to be a singer and go to New York to try her luck. Once in the Apple City, she has many problems finding someone to be interested in her music, and goes to work in a bar called ''Coyote Ugly'', where the girls (bar maids) besides giving the clients drinks also do sensual dances. She also meets the charming Australian Kevin, who she falls in love.",/review/rw3044813/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2001,Gustavo Rodriguez,10," An interesting, excellent surprise.
","I have to say that when I saw the trailer I thought this was going to be a film about some half naked women and some people drinking a lot. But, when the film ended I have to say I was really surprised. A good surprise. Some people will probably disagree with me but this is not a film about nudity or something like that, it is a film about following your dreams, about leaving home searching for something real. I think Piper Perabo is excellent in her role as Violet, who actually sings some of the songs in the film. I'd recommend it to everyone who wants to have a great time.",/review/rw3044813/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2017,Wuchakk,5," Fun and snappy, but too predictable with little depth
","Released in 2000, ""Coyote Ugly"" is a drama starring Piper Perabo as a singer/composer who leaves her home in nearby New Jersey with her dad (John Goodman) to try her hand at the music business in the big city. For money, she gets a gig at a nightclub hotspot where the female workers dance on top of the bar for entertainment, amongst other things, like dumping ice on customers now and then, spraying others with the soda gun and occasionally pouring liquor on the bar and setting it aflame (Why Sure!). Maria Bello plays the owner of the bar while Adam Garcia plays the girl's potential beau.",/review/rw3044813/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2013,robert-temple-1,8," The Adventures of Piper Perabo in Manhattan
","I decided to watch this film because I admire the work of the young actress Piper Perabo, who has been so brilliant and charming as the lead character in the ongoing series COVERT AFFAIRS. The reason why she is called 'Piper' is not because she is a tropical bird who makes strange sounds in the jungle, but because she was named after the fifties movie actress Piper Laurie, remember her? But the reason why she looks so unusual is that she is half Norwegian and half Portuguese, a mixture so rare that we have never seen one before and may never see one again. She attended high school in Toms River, New Jersey, one of the small New Jersey towns I have actually been to long ago, strange that. (How many people have been to Toms River? If you have six fingers on one hand that's too many.) I first encountered her on screen in SLAP HER SHE'S FRENCH (2002, see my review), in which she and the whole film were equally hilarious. She was also in the wonderfully funny BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA (2008, see my review). So I thought I would jump from chihuahuas to coyotes and see what that was all about. Well, what a shock. All those girls dancing on the top of a bar in a Manhattan bar called Coyote Ugly, the girls themselves being called 'coyotes'! I got a DVD of what is called the extended cut, whatever was extended. This is in some ways what is called a chick flic, but not really. Perabo plays a good little girl from the tiny South Amboy, New Jersey (is that an in joke of some kind?), who gets the nickname 'Jersey'. She loves her dad who is a widower, excellently played by John Goodman, who has just the right sentimental sad sack tone for the part. Perfect casting there. She falls for the quirky Australian actor Adam Garcia, who has just the right amount of whimsy and works at a grill, so that is the love story part of it. She moves into the most terrible filthy and collapsing apartment in China Town, but seems to love it. But it's the bar that makes your jaw drop far below floor level. The girls cavort on the bar from where they throw buckets of water and buckets of ice cubes all over the patrons, and the patrons just love it. Everybody drinks bottles of whiskey and it gets poured all over the counter and the people too. Perabo wants to be a song-writer, like her deceased mother, but is too shy to sing her own songs in public. She takes a job as a coyote to pay the rent. The girls are all dressed in as little as possible and, as the woman owner puts it, 'must give the impression of being available while not really being available'. Perabo slowly warms up to this, which is not exactly her thing. There are numerous ups and downs, not to mention sideways wriggles, and Perabo is forced to sing to the patrons of the bar to stop a violent fight, which means she has sung in public for the first time by accident. Eventually after endless rebuffs she gets someone to listen to one of her own songs. There is a lot of very good satire of the music business in the film. Perabo's father comes to the bar unexpectedly one night and is shocked, and this makes for problems, as he says he never thought he could be ashamed of her but he is. She gets fired but then gets rehired. She realizes she is not a natural coyote. The pure unrestrained anarchy of the bar is really something to see and behold, though pardon me if I don't go searching for such a place, for as much as I can cope with anarchy, I really don't want to be soaked with buckets of water all evening and forced to drink that much whiskey. I'll give it a miss. Nor do I necessarily think girls should be demeaning themselves by wriggling on bar tops. It goes against my male feminist principles. But still! It's a movie! And there she is, Piper Perabo with her girlish smile, surviving it all somehow, for after all she has a big future ahead of her as the world's cutest super-spy in COVERT AFFAIRS (to be reviewed).",/review/rw3044813/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2011,leplatypus,7," Not ugly and definitively not a bar movie as well (DVD)
","The cover with all the girls having fun in a bar isn't accurate because the bar intrigue and the friends are really a subplot. The story focuses really of the life of Violet and as a ""dreams come true"" movie, this one is really superior to ""Honey"". The reason is that even as a newcomer, Piper Parabo is definitely a better actress than Jessica Alba! She is really moving with her feelings and i like the way she manages her relationship with her father and her boyfriend. The final moments are maybe a bit rushed but i have enjoyed the journey. And what about the coyotes then? Well, they are in the back: the dance and drinks aren't so many and it's a good thing because getting drunk in a bar while peeping girls isn't my habit. Now i understand why it's a Disney production because it focuses on dreams and not booze and if the girls get loose, there is nothing scandalous.",/review/rw3044813/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2000,Chimera-5,1," Heck of a scam, Mr. Bruckheimer!
","Oh man! So I take it all the snazzy rock video-like trailers with women dancing on top of a bar was a way to get straight males thinking they'd go to this movie and see lots of boobs and maybe even a little female on female lovin' (their lamest media forced fantasy), BUT.... with a PG-13 rating clearly you can't get away with much so MAYBE, just maybe there'll be a little hooter action....Nope, sorry guys, you were misled and scammed out of $8 but as long as enough of you cram the theater the first 2 weeks hoping to see a little somethin' the studio will have already made it's money back. Haha how pathetic. Avoid this movie even if your worst enemy tells you it sucks!",/review/rw3044813/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie nearly drove me to insanity it was so bad!  This isn't even one of those movies where it's so bad it's funny!  Really, it's a lethal weapon. It gave me a pounding headache.  But really, what else could you expect from Jerry Bruckheimer.  He has absolutely no respect for human life at all!

11 May 2014,jessegehrig,2," And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine
","Horrible in that it promises and promotes itself as some lurid vivacious film about sexy lady bartenders yet delivers PG-13 wholesome goodness. Perhaps the problem is a sensible script is reduced to a movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. The name alone is synonymous with everything wrong with modern cinema: movies that sell sex rather than show it, movies that at best can only parody actual human life, movies that seem manufactured rather than made...it sucks. Maybe for you this is a great movie and you had fun seeing it, that makes you lucky in my book, but me, I had the misfortune to see this movie, not a high point in my day, in fact I watch it now and again just to try to take back from this crap movie whatever it took from me the first time I saw it.

23 July 2001,preppy-3,5," Colorful, energetic but sexist and dumb
","Small town Jersey girl (Piper Perabo) goes to NYC to be a songwriter.  While waiting to be discovered she serves drinks (and dances on the bar) of a horrible place called Coyote Ugly.  All the bartenders are beautiful, big-breasted, untalented actresses who show as much clevage as a PG-13 rating will allow.  As for the ""plot"" it's been done HUNDREDS of times before.  Every single situation and line of dialogue is yawningly predictable.  But most of the screen time is devoted to the half-naked bartenders dancing and twitching and (naturally) poring water all over themselves.  It's a PG ""Showgirls""!  I started fast-forwarding through them--there's too many of them and they are dull--although I must admit the women throw their all into it and seem to be enjoying themselves--too bad they didn't realize the movie is objectifying their bodies.  And what the hell is John Goodman doing here?  Was he really that desperate for the money?  ",/review/rw3044813/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2014,JamesHitchcock,4," The Ultimate Product Placement
","""Coyote Ugly"" is a real bar in New York; the name is presumably an ironic allusion to the fact that its female staff are all very attractive. I wonder how many other real bars in America have been able to benefit from the ultimate product placement of having an entire Hollywood movie dedicated to their activities.
