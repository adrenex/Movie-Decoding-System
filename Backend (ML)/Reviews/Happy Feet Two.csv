13 November 2019,Sleepin_Dragon,9," Mind blowing drama.
","Six parts of complex, intriguing and baffling drama. This isn't your average six part mystery series, this will have you scratching your head, questioning everything you see, and doubting the things you've seen with your own eyes.",/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv

","An engrossing and very well made series. Excellent cast, script and very well paced plot.",/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2019,brenswee,9," Thoroughly enjoyed this.
",Just writing a very quick review to say that this series is simply brilliant. I was hooked right from the pre-credits scene.,/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2019,STEVE24BUS,8," Who watches the watchers?
","This is a very believable drama, fiction yes, but how much of this stuff really happens? Plots and sub plots with the innocent manipulated to suit the various agendas of opposite sides of the coin. Hard to spot the good guys as the tale unfolds, watched all six episodes in one sitting, well worth it. Great cast and acting and some real edge of the seat drama moments.",/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2021,npjy83,9," Best British surveillance mystery
","This is one of the best UK series created. If you enjoy ""Black Mirror"" and/or ""Person of Interest"" (with Jim Caviezel) / ""Enemy of the State"" (with Will Smith) / ""Eagle Eye"" (Shia LaBeouf), then you will love this. On the same par! A hidden gem of a show!",/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2021,cjonesas,9," [9.1] Bewildered and puzzled all over - What you see is not what you get
","A superbly deep British series that I didn't understand more than half of it and that's not because it was bad, it's because you should probably watch it a dozen times to truly and fully grasp the machination schemes behind it.",/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2021,dzeilstra,8," Deepfake becoming mainstream
","An unsettling story about how images from a multitude of CCTV camera's can be manipulated to produce a ""truth"" as it is wanted. As the series unwinds you are rocked between fake and real until finally everything falls into place. The various are well cast and well played. It is always delightful to watch another well-made British series.",/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2019,Tweekums,9," Can CCTV be trusted?
",Former soldier Shaun Emery had been convicted of murdering a man in Afghanistan based on video evidence. On appeal his lawyer proves that the sound may have been out of synch in a way that suggests he could have been acting within legitimate rules of engagement. He is freed and that night celebrates with friends and his lawyer. When she leaves he follows her and the talk at the bus stop. Now things start to get complicated; CCTV operatives see them fighting just after a bus passes; when later questioned he is adamant that she got on the bus. High-flier DI Rachel Carey is given the case and initially thinks the only real mystery is what happened to the lawyer. As the investigation proceeds she starts to wonder if Emery is telling the truth; if that is the case it means that somebody was able to tamper with the live feed from London's numerous CCTV cameras. As the case deepens she finds herself in the murky world of anti-terrorism agencies and wonders who she can trust.,/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,theedeer,10," This is incredible. Another great show and actors, so well done. Like Homeland/The Americans
",Really Really well done.,/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2019,ScGreen20,9," THIS should be the benchmark for future thriller series
","How STRONG and solid storyline, sequence of scenes and events form the basis of edge-of-seat thriller.
Oh my, how a simple camera footage can be the root of gripping thriller!",/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2022,Lovegood13,10," If you like Person of Interest...
",One of the most excellent conspiracy thriller shows I've watched since Person of Interest. Holliday Granger is perfect for the role. Interesting and enthralling from the beginning. Kept me on my toes the whole time and I was eager to watch each episode as soon as they were out. I thought the show also brilliantly captured geopolitical realities of the relation between the nations mentioned in the show.,/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2019,VisualSkin,10," The capture

","This is WICKED, and the end of Season 2 is one of the most compelling pieces of film I've seen in a long long time.",/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2021,MiguelAReina,8," Solid technological thriller
","Excellent construction of a thriller that is very consistent throughout its development. This plot of false guilty (or not) taken to a society in which images have become the main element of truth verification, is completed with good interpretations. Almost bordering on science fiction (or not) suspense is correctly dosed throughout the episodes. ""The end justifies the means. The defense of the torturer.""",/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2020,cutetimster,10," Wow ...sooo goood
","I won't tell you what happens as that would spoil everything , however it's sufficient to tell you that it's one of the most watchable cop type shows I have ever seen ( and I've seen a lot ).
So you must at some point in your life sit and watch this show ...it's fantastic , no matter what anyone else says .
Enjoy .... Tim",/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2019,symoncael,10," The show excellent
","The show is excellent. It is a fresh take on investigative type shows. Every episode leaves you wanting to see the next. The new information handed on each episode is enough to satisfy your curiosity, and create new questions without it being too many. It's a good give and take. I have enjoyed every episode. I can only hope it gets a season 2.",/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2022,samthejudgeamos,9," Great drama
",Intriguing and complex this kept me interested and gagging for the next episode. Concentration needed but so worthwhile to watch. Great acting and super plot.,/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2022,zaenkney,10," Riveting!
","I found this series to be one of the finest and worth watching in one day in all my 70 years of life. The way the flashbacks were constructed amazed me. They were so easy to follow, almost magical in flow. No confusion for me. The program was weighted so heavily upon technology, equipped so well to have all our information and governments greedy to hold such power, my synapses haven't fires that much since I was in my 30's and my chest pounded like a Buddy Rich solo. A powerful series done extremely well. Did it's job, I believe... :D",/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2019,jacklivi-12870,10," A truly original premise

7 November 2019,willows84,10," Brilliant TV
","If there were more shows like this, I wouldn't leave the living room! Great acting, amazing storyline, twists here there and everywhere. I'm gutted it's finished but binged it. You know it's a good one when you can't wait to get home from work to watch it. Makes you wonder who's watching you...",/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2019,kris-gray,8," Did he or didn't he?
","First I don't understand other reviewers comments on the sound, I didn't have a problem with it nor did my German wife. I've given it 8 stars for the potential I can see in it, with solid performances from all concerned.",/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2020,nancyldraper,7," Captured by THE CAPTURE
",This series has a fascinating premise and is a very real cautionary tale for our times - can we trust what we see in recorded (or even live) media? The interplay between what we think is real and what we are seeing keeps us engaged and guessing - Did he? Didn't he? There is a constant flip flop In our conclusions. The performances were good. Holliday Grainger and Callum Turner give us characters with whom we identify which leads us to believe we can see the truth through their eyes. Ron Pearlman is a favourite actor of mine since the show BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (many moons ago) and I think he did a superb job of being the American the world hates. I give this show a 7 (very good) out of 10. Available on Amazon Prime.,/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2020,gallagherkellie,6," Second half ruined it
",The first episode was so good that I was so excited to keep going. It went downhill from there. Interesting characters but things become so convoluted towards the end and quite predictable. The ending was was ridiculous. I wanted so much to love this show!,/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2019,sajjy12,10," Boom
","Wow, whole episode (episode 3) keeps you on your toes..expecting big things, then BOOM at the end big twist, truly amazing. Very cleverly written piece of drama, best on current Tv.",/review/rw5567900/?ref_=tt_urv
