30 September 2017,jtindahouse,8," Made with infinite class
","I've only read a handful of Stephen King novels, but 'Gerald's Game' just so happens to be one of them. I liked the novel without overly loving it. It had a memorable ending, but the story was a little bland for my liking. I've heard people say it's one of their favourite King novels and also heard people say it's one of their least favourite, so it's clearly quite a polarising novel. I was excited when I heard it was going to be made into a movie though. I almost always enjoy King movie adaptions and was very interesting to see how they went about the ending I spoke of earlier. It is very rare that I enjoy a movie more than the book version (almost to the point that I can't think of a single example before now), but this is almost certainly a case of that.",/review/rw5018553/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2018,sddavis63,7," Superb Stephen King Adaptation, But An Ending I Found Silly Detracted From It
","I will confess that I have never read the Stephen King novel on which this movie is based. Maybe the end is a bit clearer in the novel, but the ending of the movie really kind of left me a bit empty. I was really enjoying this movie up to that last ten minutes or so. I can't say that I had been particularly familiar with Carla Gugino, who played Jessie in this, but I thought her performance was fabulous. The story begins with Jessie and her husband Gerald (Bruce Greenwood) taking a vacation in a remote place in the hopes of resparking their marriage, which had gone dry romantically and sexually. To do that, Gerald had brought handcuffs and handcuffed Jessie to the bed. To that point this really had something of a ""dark comedy"" feel to it; it was humourous in a warped sort of way. But it doesn't stay that way for very long. Jessie wasn't enthusiastic about Gerald's handcuff game, or the rape scenario that he wanted to play out with them, and she eventually objected, leading to a fight between them - during which Gerald dropped dead of a heart attack with Jessie still chained to the bed. Alone, with no one to help her, no food, a hungry dog that had found its way into the house and was feeding on Gerald's body and only a single glass of water, she has to find a way to survive. The movie eventually becomes a journey of self-discovery for Jessie as she finds herself exploring the demons in her own past back to her childhood and her relationship with her father and how they connect with the present.",/review/rw5018553/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2017,classicsoncall,7," "" 'cause everybody's got a little corner in there somewhere.""
","Having recently read ""Gerald's Game"" I still have a pretty good recollection of the book and found this screen adaptation to be very close to the original source. A couple minor points that don't jive would be Gerald's physical health; in the novel he's slightly overweight and not in very good shape, thereby making him a better candidate for a heart attack than a guy like Bruce Greenwood in the role. The other thing had to do with the location of the story. In the book, the house was more like a summer cabin secluded in the woods, whereas this looked like more of a neighborhood type setting. At least that's my recollection, probably more nit-picks than any problem with the screenplay.",/review/rw5018553/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2017,Fella_shibby,7," Gugino's acting was terrific. The creepiness of isolation and immobilization perfectly captured.
","Saw this recently on a DVD. Having enjoyed Flanagans Occulus n Hush, (yet to c the sequel of Ouija) i was excited to see this. The film which is based on Kings novel is about a couple trying to save their marriage by spending time at a remote house. Thru trailer itself, v come to know that after handcuffing the wife on the bed, the husband suffers a heart attack leaving the wife tied up with no help near at all. 127 hours scenario? To make matters worse, there is a hungry dog on the prowl. The wife later starts hallucinating n she goes thru the mental trauma remembering her dark past.The film succeeded in capturing the creepiness of isolation and immobilization n the growing dread. The good thing about Flanagan is that he can manage to build up tension n suspense in spite of minimum characters n action. Hush was the best example. This movie is more of a psychological survival drama with elements of horror.",/review/rw5018553/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2017,cjs6547,7," Successfully captures the feel of a Stephen King
","Stephen King is at times a brilliant writer, and most of his novels give a home-bred 70's vibe. There's the presence of raw indecency and rotten attachments right beside the gore, and this movie is very good at portraying that.",/review/rw5018553/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2017,zkonedog,10," Tremendously Captures Exactly What The Book Intended To Convey
","There are very few works of art (film, music, literature, etc.) that truly scare me or leave me feeling unsettled. Reading Stephen King's novel ""Gerald's Game"" was one of those rare experiences. This adaptation, directed by Mike Flanagan, expertly captures the essence of that creepy novel and puts it on the small screen. Earlier this fall, I proclaimed ""It"" to be perhaps the best book-to-film adaptation I have ever seen. With respect to that wonderful film in its own way, this one is perhaps even better.",/review/rw5018553/?ref_=tt_urv

17 October 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,5," Imaginative, but a bit too slow.
","I really fancied this having watches a trailer, but as is so often the case, the best bits were shown in the trailer, and the film itself was ultimately a disappointment. The writing is clever, the story is best, but as the story is literally handcuffed (no pun intended) it does limit the scope. It's well acted, it's certainly different, I just found it too hard to get into. 5/10",/review/rw5018553/?ref_=tt_urv

30 June 2021,ofumalow,5," Lifetime movie invades horror movie
","OK, I didn't realize until just now (after I'd seen the film) that this is based on a Stephen King novel. Well, no doubt in 400 pages or whatever he was able to manage enough psychological depth to pull off what ends up seeming pretty heavy-handed and contrived here. ""Game"" has a good premise, and I've liked this director's other movies, but once the central jeopardy kicks in, there's barely any time given to developing its elemental suspense before they start piling on the imaginary figures from her subconscious who advise and/or taunt the heroine during her extreme travail--a lazy fantasy plot device I've always hated. Then it turns out that the story isn't really ""How will she free herself from literal chains"" but ""How will she use this time to free herself from the mental chains of childhood sexual abuse,"" as related in flashbacks. So what you start out thinking will be a thriller instead becomes a confronting-the-past tale of self-empowerment. Themes like incest are trivialized by a context like ""I'm remembering my abuse cuz I'm stuck handcuffed to the bed by my husband who just died of a heart attack."" So while well-acted and directed, this just felt like a case where the earnest dramatic elements canceled out the horror elements, and vice versa. Not a personal best for Mike Flanagan.",/review/rw5018553/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2017,dudditslucky7,10," Contains all the pain and heart of the novel
","Ten out of ten. Other viewers can complain all they want about this film being 'tedious' or 'bland', or slightly missing the mark or opportunity, but I strongly disagree. Makes me wonder if they got the true point of the novel, even. Stephen King is NOT a horror writer, so much as he is a writer of characters and extraordinary events that they go through, and most importantly, he writes about the deep emotional experiences that people endure in their lifetimes here on this earth. He tends to throw in dark elements, to be certain, and some of those are downright creepy, frightening, or straight-up horrific; this does not make him a horror writer. And anyone expecting a horror film here will subsequently be disappointed and, I guess, apparently bored. I was not bored, I was riveted the entire time. It's not easy to do what Mike Flanagan does with this adaptation. He nails the mental struggles and fractured psyche of the main character, Jessie, under the strain of what she faces. He also delivers on the heart of King's story, which isn't the present situation she finds herself in as an adult, but rather, dealing with secrets and ghosts from her past that have haunted her all her life, without her truly even knowing 'til her current situation arises. It's a beautiful novel of pain, suffering, secrets, abuse (on multiple levels, by multiple people), and the struggle to not just survive, but also heal and thrive, if possible. Flanagan's film captures the heart of King's story, and it is beautifully rendered, and many scenes are equally visually stunning. I cried at the end of the movie. Bruce Greenwood and Carla Gugino turn in excellent performances, among the best I've seen from both of them. Henry Thomas is equally and fittingly gross. Very well done. Even younger Jessie, played by Chiara Aurelia, was exacted with nuanced grace and heartbreak. This is just a terrific movie. And I find every scene featuring Carel Struycken to be extremely creepy, so I'm not certain how other reviewers find this movie lacking in creep value. I just can't disagree more. I love this movie, it's instantly and already in my top fifteen, maybe even my top ten favorite films of all time. Well done. I'll be watching this one more than once.",/review/rw5018553/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2018,chet19,4," If only she would have tried to escape...
","Before we get into the fact that 99% of the movie occurred in her mind, we have to point out that she barely tried to escape. It was laughable! She pulled on the cuffs right away at the beginning, but then barely tried again. ""Reinforced"" wood or not, those bed posts were NOT thick and sturdy. They were skinny and very very breakable.
Also, why not roll her feet/legs up over her head and kick at the bed posts? Why not try to grasp the bed post with a leg and yank? Why not try violent up-and-down bouncing to hopefully loosen something up?
I mean, why to try escape when you can just imagine people talking to you instead?",/review/rw5018553/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2017,arungeorge13,7," Don't know about the novel, but I found Flanagan's crafting to be excellent! [+69%]
","Gerald's Game made me ponder over a lot of things - cases of incest and abusive husbands that fill up our newspapers every day, the event of the solar eclipse, the presence of something sinister (in the dark of the night), and introspection during arduous situations - Mike Flanagan (directing from a screenplay by himself and Jeff Howard, based on a Stephen Kind novel) connects these dots magnificently in a crisp psychological horror-thriller than runs for 105 minutes.

","GERALD'S GAME stands out as the worst Stephen King novel I've ever encountered, a near-plot less journey through various concepts all based around a single-location thriller, which I typically love.

15 November 2017,billcr12,4," A Stephen King soap opera
","Stephen King's books are hit or miss when adapted and this one is a big miss. I have not read the book yet, but I have read many of the early stuff, from Carrie to Misery. Shawshank Redemption is the best film, closely followed by Dead Zone and The Green Mile. A woman and her husband have a little getaway to try to rekindle their failing marriage and the man handcuffs his better half to the bed. He pops a blue pill and promptly drops dead. Pfizer may have a lawsuit on its' hands here. The following hour and a half are a drag as the woman has long and tedious conversations with her dead husband and with a version of herself. A bad relationship with dad are shown through flashbacks and none of it works. I was bored to tears.",/review/rw5018553/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2018,masonfisk,4," KING NOT AT HIS BEST...!
","During my blast of reading all that was Stephen King in the mid-90's, I remember this novel as being the latest, up to that point, piece of writing I got my hands on before going into retirement as it were. I remember the yarn being well told but as you read most of King's output you start getting set pieces or plot through lines you've read before. Rabid dog on the loose, Cujo, check, incapacitated bed occupant, Misery, check & traumatic event occurring on the day of a solar eclipse, Dolores Clairbourne, check anew. We now have the filmed version of Gerald's Game whereby a loveless married couple trying to rekindle their union w/a pair of handcuffs soon open the floodgates of calamity & terrifying claustrophobia. Sparsely acted & directed, the film works in fits & starts w/the bedroom scenes near soundless except for the seemingly unending dialogue which paints things a little much the obvious. The denouement involving a mysterious bogeyman feels forced & unnecessary given everything else which has come before that it threatens to capsize the entirety of the exercise.",/review/rw5018553/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2017,jordanrossreviews,8," Gerald's Game was surprisingly more introspective and less gruesome than I imagined.
","Gerald's Game was surprisingly more introspective and less gruesome than I imagined (except one particularly cringe-worthy scene). From a viewer who didn't read the Stephen King novel the film was based upon, I went into the Netflix original prepared to be disturbed. The film doesn't waste time getting you to the meat of the story. From the start Carla Gugino gives an emotionally powerful performance as Jessie – a mentally abused victim struggling to repair a failing marriage - that sets the tone for the rest of the film. The reluctance she shows toward her husband Gerald (Bruce Greenwood) forces you to never sit comfortably as the plot begins to be painted. ",/review/rw5018553/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2021,michaelRokeefe,8," In the name of love
","Based on a Stephen King novel, who wouldn't give this one a chance? After all, Mr. King is not totally a horror writer; he just happens to write about human situations that sometimes travel through some weird, horrible and even paranormal circumstances. Jessie (Carla Gugino) and her husband Gerald (Bruce Greenwood) travel to their remote lake house thinking they can spice up their stagnant marriage. Gerald suffers a heart attack while his wife is handcuffed to the bed. Jessie must fight hopelessly to survive, while being forced to face some of her traumatic past. Creepy, frightful and in-your-face horror. One of the better King adaptations to film and Miss Gugino near perfection.",/review/rw5018553/?ref_=tt_urv

6 October 2017,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,8," ""Gerald's Game""- A fascinating and gripping tale of suspense that takes hold and never lets go despite a shaky and questionable finale...
","From the mind of Stephen King and director Mike Flanagan comes ""Gerald's Game"", a Netflix original movie based upon King's novel that takes a simple and elegant premise and successfully uses it weave a tale of suspense that is among the year's most impressive of surprise treats. And though it might not quite reach the great heights attained by the best adaptations of King's work, Flanagan's fierce and stunning portrayal of a woman pushed to the brink of insanity in a desperate bid for survival is a slick and very satisfying adaptation. And it stands tall and proud among the catalog of films and franchises that Netflix has launched over the past five years.",/review/rw5018553/?ref_=tt_urv

Then they were all talking to each other and it just keep getting more and more confusing after that. Then out of nowhere a slender man type of person appears and takes her ring! What the heck?
