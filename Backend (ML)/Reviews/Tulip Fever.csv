12 May 2002,pumaye,," A mixed bag, full of pleasant surprises
","I have seen most of the episodes from the two seasons of ""The Hunger"" the audacious project in sex and horror of the Scott brothers. Most of the 30 minutes episodes are based on well known horror stories from such terrific sources like Graham Masterton, David Schow, Poppy Brite, Karl Edward Wagner, Brian Lumley, Kim Newman (to name only a few), while directors are often very famous, like Russel Mulcahy or Tony Scott. First season was hosted by Terence Stamp, while the second by David Bowie. Most of the stories have a strong sexual element and almost all of them (especially in the second season) have one or more sex scenes, nudity and very often also graphic violence. Several of stories are really disturbing and among them there also a few masterpieces, like ""Wrath of God"", ""Sin Seer"" and ""Week Woman"" from season two, ""Anais"", ""Necros"" and ""Bridal Suite"" from season one. Apart from a few real turkeys, most of the stories are at least enjoyable for the horror fan and several of them are worth repeated viewings",/review/rw0400621/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2001,Gluck-3,," Not a bad dish
","Not having cable, I recently discovered this series on DVD... the well-done horror based series is not easy to find, TALES FROM THE CRYPT being an exception, but this one seemed to deliver... some of the time. The DVD only featured four episodes from Terence Stamp's reign (David Bowie sounds like a promisingly good replacement, as at least he was in the original movie) and although not every segment packed a punch, a couple were pretty good... in particular, ""Necros,"" directed by Russell Mulcahy. It was also interesting that the scenes involving passion were on the forceful side, as the typical Hollywood movie usually depicts such primal action as slow, tame, and loving.",/review/rw0400621/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2005,pninson,8," One of my favorite shows
","This horror/SF/fantasy/soft-porn series, produced by Ridley and Tony Scott, is a kind of Twilight Zone for adults. There were two seasons on Showtime, the first with Terence Stamp as the host, the second with David Bowie.",/review/rw0400621/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2006,Company_of_Wolves,," A Master Class is Passion and Style.
","""The Hunger"" is a tour de force of passion and lust. Each tale, poetically introduced by Terrance Stamp in season one and David Bowie in season two, brings us into a world of unbridled, un-inhibited passion. The show preaches no self righteous moral, no great and uplifting message is hidden away and more often than not the ending is far from happy. ""The Hunger"" illustrates how lust is an essential part of our lives, that it need not be denied but is always dangerous.",/review/rw0400621/?ref_=tt_urv

2 September 2009,Brookic0,10," Hidden little gem!
","I have just discovered this anthology TV series. It's sort of like Masters of Horror (well it's an anthology series with different stories in each episode, but besides that they are not really that similar). I prefer this much more than I did Masters of Horror b/c it doesn't rely on gore to tell the story. Don't get me wrong I enjoy gore every now and then, but I felt MOH relied a little too much on it. Plus these stories are well thought out and I haven't found one yet that has been just flat out boring. I'm only half way through the first season and so far the stories that have stood out to me were The Swords, The Secret Shih-Tan, Bridal Suit, and the Sloan Men. A lot of these were short stories by really great British authors such as Graham Masterson and a few of the stories may of been from Canadian authors(not sure). Watching these even led me to look up some of the stories online and I found a great little book series of short stories called Hot Blood. I will say that I really enjoy reading Graham Masterson's short stories and I really wish they would of done episodes based on Changeling and Sex Object (although I guess that one would of been hard to duplicate onto the TV screen). I must say I love horror anthologies and this has truly been a hidden gem that I've discovered. Too bad that it didn't get much critical acclaim in the USA b/c I feel it could of been a huge hit with advertising. Possibly the next Twilight Zone or Outer Limits with a touch of horror and erotica. I love this and wish they'd make another horror/erotica anthology based off the Hot Blood series. There are some wonderful stories in those books. It's sad that we no longer have an anthology series airing on TV since they discontinued Fear Itself (which was okay, but it should never have been on regular TV programming it should of been on HBO, Showtime, Cinemax etc. that way it didn't have to be so dulled down). I just hope we don't have to wait too long until someone makes another anthology series, I don't even mind if it is more sci-fi like Twilight Zone or Outer Limits as long as we get a new one. I like having new twisted little stories every week, however I guess when I finish this series that I will have to rely on books to get my fix. Another thing I have learned is that the British have a lot to offer whether it be their novels/books/short stories or their TV shows. I had already fallen in love with The Secret Diary of a Call Girl and now I have discovered The Hunger and all these great authors. I just wish they'd bring more of this to the USA, I mean they get to see a lot more of our (the USA) media than we do theirs (British).",/review/rw0400621/?ref_=tt_urv

8 July 2020,Crystal_Dive,8," Great Horror shorts for the 1st Season
","2nd Season is offloaded to the Brits as a 2nd production. So , it's at best, a 30% hit rate for that season. As this is an anthology, with 20+ episodes per season, a general score for this diversity is inherently misleading.",/review/rw0400621/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2020,Crystal_Dive,8," Great anthology
","This is an era of production where some themes of sexual depravity can be put on film. (only some episodes explicitly explore this) . I do not understand why this is a critique by others, as this series is meant to explore the results of quenching the thirsts of the various dark Hungers of our souls.",/review/rw0400621/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2003,lordofthelake,," I wish I could rate this film.
","I wish I could rate this cheesy piece of crap so that I could let the world know how pathetic it is. This is not horror, it isn't even camp. It's a hodgepodge of cheesey dialogue, cheap horror props and lots of T&A. If you are looking for T&A with a campy horror edge, try The Bare Wench Horror instead.",/review/rw0400621/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2008,edelstranger-1,10," Excellent serial!
","Serial ' Hunger ' have created on motives of the film of Toni and Ridley Skott with the same name. This surprising, bewitching narration about love and sex, treachery and death, secret passions and the deep feelings destroying a body and a soul. The new fascinating anthology of all forbidden and strange is removed on motives of the selected products of the best writers of the past and the present - Edgara Alan Po, Robert Bloha, Bryan Lamli and the founder ' Rambo' David Morrela.",/review/rw0400621/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2020,stullcastro,8," My review of the first season.
","These were my thoughts as i watched the show on dvd.
First two episodes: Great, Very strong acting and directing.
Next four episodes: Not as good acting and directing, But still not terrible and very watchable.
Episode 7: Mediocre and boring despite some good acting.
Episode 8: Terrible
Episodes 9-10: Same as episode 7
Episode 11: As good as the first two.
Episodes 12-14: Same as episode 8.
Episode 15: Gus Fring should make this episode interesting but no, Also the lead actress wasn't very good.
Episode 16: Same as episode 8
Episode 17: Kinda confusing but i like Bruce Davison
Episode 18: Stephen McHattie tries but he can't save it, Bad but in a more entertaining and fun way.
Episode 19: Worst episode
Episode 20: Average, I liked the acting and the host segment.
Episode 21: same as episode 11.
Episode 22: same as episode 8.",/review/rw0400621/?ref_=tt_urv
