10 November 2021,atractiveeyes,8," Creepy
","Thailand's official submission to 2022's Oscars is the creepiest exorcism movie I have ever seen. It's so scary, brutal, captivating and provocative. It grabs your attention and keeps you on the edge of your seats from the very beginning until the credits start rolling. It's the year's best horror film so far.",/review/rw7376381/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2021,Sir_AmirSyarif,7," Burns slowly but intensely throughout
","Thai-Korean supernatural horror, Banjong Pisanthanakun's 'The Medium,' burns slowly but intensely throughout. It has all the elements of Asian horror unique to the Korean and Thai genres, such as creepy music and a darkly saturated filter. The film loses steam at times owing to flaws in its mockumentary style, but Pisanthanakun succeeds far more when he concentrates on the complexities of the familial links and what some of the key reveals imply for each character.",/review/rw7376381/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2021,lareval,9," Scary, twisted and brutal Thai horror
","The Thai horror has just achieved a new step up into the genre with this bone-chilling, nerve-wracking movie. Its more than two hours fly through a complex and engaging story revolving about family, legacy, curses and devilish fates. It's more fast paced and much more entertaining than many movies under 90 minutes. The performances are top notch and the filmmaking style a la found footage is very effective. The POV helps to introduce the audience into the reality of the story, so when the scares starts, it's a total knock-out. Until a more conventional third act (in a good way, though), the two thirds of the movie manages to scare the living daylights of you without cheap jump-scares, which is pure gold nowadays. The ending is much more filled with them, but that's not a downer for me at all. It's a twisted, ballsy ending that works wonderfully with how the story was building up until that moment. While I could watch it with lights out (unlike the Thai cinemas whose audience demanded to watch it with lights on - if it is not a marketing sting), I recognize its hipnotic power upon me from start to finish, its ability to scare properly and the fact that I keep thinking about the movie after watching it. A terrific horror movie, a must see if you are a fan of the genre.",/review/rw7376381/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2021,frankblack-79961,5," Profound idiocy ruins what should have been a great horror movie.
","This was suprisingly good until the characters got completely stupid. There was some great creativity in the plot, but like so many movies, the writers relied on utter stupidity from the characters to drive the plot and situations forward. Some great scenes in this film though. Very hardcore in some aspects.",/review/rw7376381/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2021,stereosteve-1,6," Okayish, but nothing new.
","Saw this at the cinema last night, and while I found it to be good-looking and well-made, with an interesting setting, it was still nothing new or special. I've seen everything in this film before. Nowhere near on the same level as The Wailing, which this shares many elements with.",/review/rw7376381/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2021,CinemaClown,," The Scariest Horror Film Of 2021
","The scariest film of the year so far and one of the creepiest entries in the world of horror in recent years, The Medium begins as a documentary about a shaman possessed by a local deity in North-east Thailand but soon develops into a dreadful & diabolical nightmare that you can't escape from. Powerful, petrifying & perturbing in equal measure, this Thai-South Korean supernatural horror reeks of death & devilry.",/review/rw7376381/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2021,kannibalcorpsegrinder,10," One of the finest films in the genre
","Followed by a film crew, the psychic medium of a remote section of Thailand being documented uncovers enough evidence to realize her niece is the target of a supernatural attack and tries to save her, but as it continues finds herself confronted by a darker and more malicious spirit than she anticipated.",/review/rw7376381/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2021,jtindahouse,5," Tries far too hard to scare and for that reason fails to do so
","Less is almost always more in horror. Especially in demon/possession films. When people watch 'Paranormal Activity' and say it felt like nothing happened, I tell them that's why it's so effective. It's supernatural, however it feels like it could happen for that reason. 'The Medium' goes the other way. It goes off the wall nuts, and for that reason I found it almost completely ineffective and frankly boring.",/review/rw7376381/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2021,MovieQween-33622,8," I'm absolutely terrified
","Spoiler Free: This movie has been on my watchlist and I was so happy when it finally came out! I saw some mixed reviews and while I can understand, I sit here purely and utterly terrified. I just finished the movie 15 min ago and I'm laying here awake, checking all of my doors and windows... Why, you may ask? Because I got spooked! The Wailing was a movie made by the same creators or directors and that is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen to date. This movie is definitely in the same vein of horror and similar vibes. The last third just goes completely bonkers!! But does not have quite the same punch in the ending as the Waling. I'd recommend this movie if you love the synopsis and or trailer so far. Get ready for a wild ride!!",/review/rw7376381/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2021,youngcollind,6," I didn't want to use this pun, but The Medium is, well, medium
","In the first leg it has a lot going for it. The cinematography is great, and as much as they attempt to make things dreary, this thing could really function as travel vlog for Thailand. The faux doc style brings a realism to the mystic elements and it feels like a unique backdrop for a horror flick. The setup is slow but enjoyable and you begin to wonder if it's ever going to erupt into full blown horror. Rest assured, it does. However, with the quality of the preamble, you grow to believe the film had something more clever up it's sleeve. What you eventually get is a rather run of the mill possession tale, and things sort of fall apart from there.",/review/rw7376381/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2021,ansirahka,5," Meh
","The story, cinematography, and plot were good, the movie just felt unpolished overall. The biggest turn-off for me is how underwhelming and overly awkward ""mink"" character was, i don't know if it was lack of direction or a miscast but homegirl gave elizabeth berkley-showgirls vibe instead of emily rose. And the third act of the movie is just nonsensical with no payoffs.",/review/rw7376381/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,edgar_manik,3," Starts promising and ends in zombie apocalypse
","I watched this movie after hearing rant about this movie. The trailer is also very promising. The movie started with interview about the shaman, and a team of documenting following her and her family lives. Everything looks so right in the beginning, but throughout the movie, all this documentary idea feels so wrong. A team of documenter who just recorded the scene without feeling scared and running away, until he got eaten. Seriously? And the cameraman not doing anything while everything already end up so wrong, he just stood there recording. Big flaws. Spirit posses human body not gonna make you a zombie eating flesh. And there are reviews comparing this to ""The Wailing"". The difference in storyline and quality of story are night and day. Don't bother to go to theater to watch this. Just wait till it's on tv.",/review/rw7376381/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2021,hiraishinnojutsu,8," The Thai Version of The Wailing
","And I meant that as a compliment too, not only because it kinda reminds me of the said movie, I mean the atmosphere, the build up, the devilish/demonic horor theme, how could anyone not see the similarities? Though the director combined it with documentary/mockumentary-turned-into-found-footage style of shots/filmmaking, making it unique to the south korean horror hit and among other horror movies.",/review/rw7376381/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,PConsoul,7," Have a potential to be so good but couldn't reach the peak
",I must say I put my expectation high for this since I love Binjong's previous movies; Alone and Shutter but I'm a bit not satisfied since this one is less scary and story is less impacted compare to his previous horror work. Most scariest scene are already in the trailer and some part doesn't really make sense and brought more question than answer. Still this movie is worth watching and deserve at least 7/10 not bad but not reach its maximum potential.,/review/rw7376381/?ref_=tt_urv

4 November 2021,andrewchristianjr,8," SCARIEST HORROR OF 2021.
",It's a terrifying movie that doesn't rely much on jump scares. An incredibly insane film but it doesn't stress you out as much as others might say. There are a lot of questions this movie creates that was never explicitly answered and you would probably watch an ending explained video to find other people theorizing and maybe remind you of something you might've missed. My other problem with this movie is that some of the characters are so goddamn foolish.,/review/rw7376381/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2021,zenzenzenzen,3," Great Idea, poor execution
","As a hardcore horror fan and a Thai nationality. This movie is somewhat revolutionary. 0 superstar casting, very authentic vibes overall and there are many cool approach in the storytelling that differs from other Thai horror films. AND Na Hong-jin is evolving in this, so it should be pretty good right? Nope.",/review/rw7376381/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2021,witra_as,8," Religious elements and local shamanism made great horror
",Slow-burn Thai horror which blended religious elements from local shamanism. It might be too raw at times with conceivably real-life characters. Banjong guided us through some intriguing footage of unexpected turns. Your guts will be challenged during its final act.,/review/rw7376381/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2022,Qoenntrell,4," Too Slow
","The build up is far too slow for the pay off towards the end when the entertainment started, though the found footage style horror film combined with local folklore might intrigue some as it did with me. Those without much patience or an interest in this genre of film won't be able to get through this movie.",/review/rw7376381/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2021,zara-jane-qadry,2," Don't know whats the big hype about being scary
",Its not scary but even though i didn't like the movie it shows how black magic in Asia can be and how bad it can get its a true potray of it and this is just some. I wish they would make real documentary and true victims and theirs experiences and how these events effect them as a family.,/review/rw7376381/?ref_=tt_urv
