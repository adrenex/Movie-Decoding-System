31 October 2010,littlemartinarocena,8," Jackson, the risk taker
","I vaunt myself of being an independent thinker and yet I was taken by the atrocious reviews ""The Lovely Bones"" got. Rogert Ebert called it ""deplorable"" I didn't go to see it when it first came out. Shame on me! The risks Peter Jackson took, a thoroughly established filmmaker, should be applauded. True, it's not going to be everybody's cup of tea but then, what is? I was taken by surprise, a film of unbearable emotional suspense breaking every imaginable rule. We're far too used to have stories in which everything is neatly tied up by the end, so we can go back home with a fictitious peace of mind. In ""The Lovely Bones"" we know who the monster is from the time the monstrosity is committed but we're only spectators unable to do anything about it and that frustration may have turn part of the audience and most of the critics away. True the CGI of the ""in between"" is, sometimes, too much but the film as a whole is a real experience. Saorise Ronan is marvelous, so are Rachel Weitz and Mark Whalberg. Stanley Tucci was deservedly nominated for an Oscar and Susan Sarandon, another risk taker, plays the emotional constipated grandmother with great courage. Look at the exhaustion on her face as she takes care of the family, drained without betraying the arid nature of the character. As the film ended I stayed in silence for the longest time, embedded in the sadness, clinging to the hope and mystified by the massacre the critics perpetrated in this original and highly recommendable film",/review/rw2563333/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2010,Larry-115,8," Good effort at extremely challenging adaptation
","In navigating the torrent of negativity to which this movie has been subjected, one thing to keep in mind is that it's an adaptation of a very widely read and popular book.",/review/rw2563333/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2010,Quinoa1984,3," a grand, sloppy folly for Peter Jackson, his writers
","I'm not sure how so much could go wrong on this film. It seemed like a pretty sure thing: a book that has been very widely acclaimed and read as a work of sad life-and-death meditation from a 14 year old girl looking down or somehow from the ""in-between"", a kind of purgatory, after being raped and murdered, on her family and killer. It seems like the stuff that could make for some harrowing dramatic material... or, possibly, a sappy story. It turns out Jackson takes the latter route, but there's more than that wrong here. It's a giant miscalculation that has a few moments of real impact and where the performances match up with the material.",/review/rw2563333/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2016,AlsExGal,6," A look into author Alice Sebold's psyche, but clouded by special effects
","If the movie had been truer to the book I would have given it 8/10, but as it is, it just makes being dead seem super cool and Jackson injects too much CGI into a story that just doesn't need it. Plus, do you really think it would be heaven to look down on your loved ones and see what they are REALLY doing? Their true faces? I don't think that seeing their sins, big and little, would be comforting at all. Mom what are you doing with that detective??? BLECH! (That's in the book not in the movie). The story is that of Susie, a 14 year old girl, destined to be forever 14 when she is raped and murdered by a neighbor in 1973. She floats around, looking at events below throughout the film, until she finally enters into heaven, conversing with her killer/rapist's other victims.",/review/rw2563333/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2011,trashgang,7," a lot of dream sequences
","Although this isn't really a horror for me still it's classified under horror. I can understand that some people will find it gruesome due the subject but I must say that it had no drip of red stuff in it. Not that that is important, just look at Texas Chainsaw or Halloween, they were bloodless too. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed this creepy flick. It reminded me a lot of The Loved Ones somehow, it must be the use of slow motion and the score. On the other hand it also reminded me of Heavenly Creatures by the way they used the dream sequences. It's a special flick coming from the hand of Peter Jackson. Knowing him for splatter and gore in his earlier days this could be a let down for some but I really liked it the way it was shot and the use of CGI didn't bother me at all. Not for everyone but if you can stand weird flicks than this won't be a problem for you.",/review/rw2563333/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2011,TheLittleSongbird,6," Okay, but with a lot of faults
","I have read the book. I loved it, I thought it was both chilling and heartbreaking with a fine story and credible characters. I do think it is much better than the film, which was solid enough but lacking a strong emotional core.",/review/rw2563333/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2010,MovieAddict2016,2," The film's lack of commitment to any singular theme renders the picture offensive rather than just boring
","Peter Jackson's The Lovely Bones is a colossally misguided failure. Based on the well-received 2002 novel by Alice Sebold, Jackson -- along with his Lord of the Rings cohorts, Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh -- has penned a meandering screenplay, made merely all the worse by uniformly awful performances, poor editing, and generally bad film-making.",/review/rw2563333/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2022,Jeremy_Urquhart,5," What a strange movie.
","Some of it works, but some of it also feels very off, maybe a little bloated, and somewhat muddled. I'm in the middle of liking it and disliking it, so can see for sure how it's one of Peter Jackson's more divisive films.",/review/rw2563333/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2019,dgrozier,10," Wannabe Film Critics Go build your model trains
","Awesome film. Great performances by the top billed cast. Just rewatched after a few years.
One ""critic"" wrote
I'm pretty cynical ,being that my fav genres are SCI-FI and HORROR,,,pffffffft bahahaha
I've given it 10. Or 5 stars out of 5
Whatever you want to say,,,if you weren't taken in by this movie
Maybe you are too cynical and should stick to sci fi and horror ,,and probably action dont kid yourself professor high brow.
And talk about creepy.
Willis is worse (in a good way) than the king of creeps robin williams (rip)
Wallberger is perfect. The whole cast.
And people complaining about Jackson over use of fricken CGi?
Its a painterly idea of an afterlife?
What did you want? Realism?
Pretty heavy
I can only watch it once every few years.

16 November 2012,Theo Robertson,5," The Mixed Messege Screams Kill Them All And Let God Decide
",This was a highly anticipated film on its release . Based upon the cult novel by Alice Sebold and directed by Peter Jackson it opened to very Luke warm reviews by the critics . Normally I don't care what critics say but since I was very short of money I decided to save myself the price of a cinema ticket and catch it for free. In the mean time a lot of time had passed before I caught it tonight and I don't know if the criticisms of the film adaptation of THE LOVELY BONES had prejudiced my own opinion but this is a highly offensive film and we all know why don't we ? ,/review/rw2563333/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2011,LloydBayer,6," Vivid and abstract, but a good story nonetheless
","Adapting a film from a source material that is anything but intended for cinema is always a tricky thing to do. Judging by the largely negative criticism this film received, Alice Sebold's novel by the same name is apparently gutted by director Peter Jackson. Apparently, because that is exactly what some mainstream critics seem to think. On the other hand, I have not read Sebold's novel. As such, I think it's safe to assume that my experience may have been better than those who did read her book. Even so, I'm sure my experience was a lot better than those who read it and watched the film with the sole intention of harshly comparing one to the other. Even J. K. Rowling has her fair share of 'haters' when you talk about what Harry Potter does on screen, as compared to what he does in one of her books. So the next time you decide to lash out at a film maker for not living up to your novel (pun unintended) experience, think for a minute what it would be like to watch a movie, adapted word for word from the novel it's sourced. Even if you read one page at the rate of one minute, how would a 300 or 400 page novel translate into a 300 or 400 minute movie? Even if that were possible, what good would it be if the source material was not altered for the screen? And why shouldn't it be, given that both mediums are limited in creativity.

21 August 2017,sorearm,10," A Beauty
","I watched The Lovely Bones for the second time last night. The first time I saw it was a few years ago and I remember my internal, one-liner review from then: Peter Jackson, (I can't stand LOTR films) you've found the right subject matter to showcase your visual talent. This time around, maybe I'm getting soft, but how gripping this film is from start to finish. Many films you can easily take a break from or let your mind drift but I found this film totally captivating, to the point where I felt some sort of connection between it's mood and vague emotions from my own childhood.",/review/rw2563333/?ref_=tt_urv

","I just saw The Lovely Bones today & having let it set in I thought it was a tremendous film!!! OK, I'll admit that Peter Jackson tried a little too much to overpower the film with CGI but that does not take anything away from the heart & emotion this film can generate.

16 April 2018,TigerHeron,3," Ludicrous and Offensive
","Worse than a waste of time. The main character (the dead girl) does something stupid no one with an IQ over 70 would do in real life, resulting in her murder. Most of the movie is Disney-esque sequences of an afterlife, with no plot. The actual plot takes place on earth, but it consists of almost nothing. We see a family grieve, fall apart, come back together, and the murder is solved...except it isn't. The murderer gets away, and we're supposed to believe justice was served when, as an old man, he dies in an accident. Meanwhile, if you have a brain, you realize he had continued his serial rape/murders until his untimely death. In other words, it's a movie about spending his entire life getting away with rape and murder of girls and women. Hello? .",/review/rw2563333/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2010,lordjin,10," This is a great, great, great movie.
","I'd like to preface my review with a comment about the negativity circulating around here about this movie. I don't think it's any coincidence that some of these self-appointed ""film-making experts"" who have nothing remotely positive to say about Jackson's effort cannot formulate complete sentences. It's not surprising at all that someone obsessed with the wetness of a prop in one scene and its dryness in the next lacks the faculty and capacity to appreciate the many merits of this film. It's ridiculous to knit-pick on 'unrealistic' depictions of this aspect of day to day life or that aspect. If you want a realistic depiction of day to day life, observe the world around you, not a movie screen.",/review/rw2563333/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2010,Angelus2,1," The plot is great....The film is not.
","I have not had the opportunity to read the novel, but from what I gathered from the trailer, it seemed that this film was going to be one of the best of the year, with a brilliant cast, who could nothing but wonders to the script, led by the man behind 'Lord of the Rings'.",/review/rw2563333/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2010,SweetOOgaBOOga,10," People were expecting this movie to be something it wasn't meant to be. It was Beautiful.
","I loved the movie. I'm lost as to why EVERYONE hates this movie. It wasn't meant to be a visceral, dark, gore movie like those that have been coming out these days. I think people are looking right past what it was meant to be, and is. It is a story of a child brutally murdered, but that's only one part of the story. It isn't a true story, it's FICTION. The fantasy and sweet emotion were meant to give a beautiful idea among all the horrific things that people commit on earth. That there may be a wonderful place in between (Hope). It was not meant to be a horror or thriller movie but an inspiring, uplifting movie despite the sadness. I'm not saying it was perfect but it certainly was NOT as horrible as people are saying. I enjoyed it. I was scared, I cried, I laughed and was entertained. Isn't that what a movie is all about?",/review/rw2563333/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2010,PaddyReagan,8," Insightful and Unsettling
","Prejudice is one of the greatest spoilers in our lives. It damages relationships, sends innocent men to prison, it influences choices in the marketplaces we frequent. Reading a book and dozens of reviews beforehand is the surest way to prejudice attitudes about any movie. I brought my own prejudice to The Lovely Bones. As the father of a 14 year old daughter any movie featuring the brutal death of a child is sure to tear my heart out. As such, Bones made me suffer through a tragedy that every family dreads.",/review/rw2563333/?ref_=tt_urv
