18 April 2020,aarongnr,9," Utterly unrealistic, but VERY enjoyable nontheless
","This show is ridiculously unrealistic, but tbh I don't even care. It's obvious that it's not supposed to be the most serious show ever, so I'm totally fine with it being completely over the top.",/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2021,brynnmccullagh,6," All the drama is driven by stupidity
","I like this show, but it can be very frustrating to watch at times. The acting is decent, but as many others have already pointed out, the casting is a bit ridiculous. The lead actor, who is playing a 16 year old, is nearly 30. He doesn't look even remotely like a 16 year old. All the actors playing teenagers are far too old for the roles they have been cast to play and it ruins the immersion for me somewhat. Is it really so hard to find decent actors that at least look the age of the part they are playing?",/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Worth Watching!
","I wasn't really sure what to expect from Outer Banks as I originally thought it was a show aimed just for teens but I couldn't of been more wrong. It's a show where people of all ages can enjoy it. It's about a teenager and his three best friends who hunt for a legendary hidden treasure after his father's disappearance. It takes a while to get going but once it does it doesn't slow down. There's something about this show that makes it feel authentic. It's a well enough written show where it will keep you following along and having a good time doing it. It has the perfect blend of comedy, drama, mystery, etc to keep you entertained. I really did enjoy it much more than I thought I would. If you're looking to turn off your mind and just enjoy a fun show...this is it!",/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2020,stephaniechristopher,7," As an old person, surprisingly I liked it
","Watched with my 12yo and went in thinking I would rather put toothpicks in my eyeballs, BUT it was actually good. And I appreciated the care they took with issues of consent for a teen show.",/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2021,gapatrick-30455,5," Almost really good, but ruined by stupidity
","I remember the first season as being a generally fun, rich kids vs. Poor kids, teen drama/adventure/treasure hunt. The biggest downsides were the overly old cast and quite a few cringe-worthy situations and choices. Like a lot of ""teen"" shows, it would have been better cast with actual teens (or just have them be in college instead of high school), but it seems typical to cast 27 year old guys as 17 year olds in grade 11 these days.",/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2021,jleeharris-36991,5," You'll yell at the screen
","This was enjoyable somewhat, but when the police are after you take time to have a long kiss and discuss your life with your friends. Very unrealistic and frustrating. Could have been lots better with better writing.",/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv

23 September 2021,jamericanbeauty,4," Lowered My IMDb Rating. Writers Ruined Season 2.
","Season 1 was a fun, adventurous show about a treasure hunt, friendships, rivalries, some relationship drama and family secrets. The main foursome at the story's core were all likeable and had chemistry. The scenic background was a beautiful costar. I didn't like how Season 1 ended, but I loved the cast and looked forward to Season 2. Episode 1 was bad. Tonight, I made it about 20 minutes into Episode 2. After Kiara screamed ""murderer!!!!"" thereby alerting said murderer to their hidden location right after she, JJ and Pope secured evidence to clear Jon B., I was done. Her actions also resulted in the evidence being destroyed. When did Kiara get so impulsive and reckless? Season 2's Bahamas storyline is nonsensical too, but erratic Kiara was the last straw for me.",/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2021,Logic278,2," Season 2 got annoying
","Watched season 1 and really enjoyed it so was looking forward to season 2. Started watching season 2, and wondered when did the characters get so annoying, most of the drama has come out of the character's stupidity, for example, Kiara who was extremley annoying in season 2 more than 1, why scream murderer after watching a murder and you are getting proof for! The shouting amongst themselves was so annoying, I had to keep turning the volume down as it was grating,the only character who did not annoy was JJ. Quite disappointed with season 2.",/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2021,Carambotti,1," A crescendo of awful
",I'm now watching season two in painful micro-doses because it is so silly. I've never had such a viscerally painful reaction to a bad show.,/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2021,jdejesus7645,3," This is written for young people with zero common sense.
","YEAH, I can't. Everything about this shows bothers me, however My girlfriend loves it.",/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2021,fla_panthers35,4," First season good, second season was terrible.
",I don't even know if I can finish this second season. First season was good enough to make me watch season two. Right now I'm totally regretting this choice.,/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2020,whipstitchwebwork,9," Quarantine Suprise
","Like you, I've been holed up binge watching Nexflix and Prime. I've watched everything under the sun. This had just come out on Netflix and I started watching it. I never stopped.
It is a fun and enjoyable show. The casting is extraordinary...every actor hits it out of the park.
The story moves along at an engaging pace to the end, yet looking back, every episode could stand as a one off...on it's own. It's a remarkable accomplishment and kudos to the writers.
It's hard to categorize the genre. It's rated m, but no nudity or gore. I see no reason why a 13 year old couldn't watch it. It's funny, has many mini adventures, many misadventures, romance, shipwrecks, storms, fires, gunshots, keggers, jail, boys save girls, girls save boys, parents are devil's, parents are angel's, treasure maps ...and the show has fun doing all of it.
Perfect for a quarantine.",/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2020,deadsenator,1," Utter dreck. Do not bother.
","I do not understand the good reviews. I am okay with light teen type adventures, but this show is so poorly written it was constantly frustrating. Cliches after cliches.",/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2020,jefbishop,8," Pretty Decent
","If Into The Blue had a baby with The O.C. and that baby had an affair with the baby of the Goonies and National Treasure, this is your type of show.
I really couldn't care less about kid acting, the story is fun and always had my attention. Another season would be great!",/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2021,petergitau-26485,2," Season 2
","Season 1 was excellent. The writing for Season 2 seems exaggerated and over the top, actors constantly make stupid and dumb decisions, always leading to extreme outcomes.",/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2021,lcorkysue,2," Far fetched
",Hate to be a Debbie downer but season 2 was awful. The plot was all over the place and really lost the momentum of season 1. The characters get into unbelievable circumstances and the ending was totally nonsense.. don't expect to enjoy this season the same as season 1.,/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2021,AlGluck,4," Novel concept ruined by second season
","I found the first season interesting, with a unique plot, reasonably good action, eye candy, strong performances, and appealing, colorful cinematography... so, despite the fact that there were some annoying plot elements, I decided once I finished with that first season that I'd go ahead and watch the second when it was released (which explains why I gave this show 4 stars instead of 1).",/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2021,samueljamesdow,1," First season decent, second is a joke.
","Dumb and dumber meets fools gold season 2 episode 2 I quit. I turned off when they caught a murder on camera but as luck would have it one of them randomly starts shouting at the murderer to draw the attention to them for literally no reason at all apart from it's a good way to write in the camera accidentally being broken by causing a panic situation...there's unrealistic and there is pure dumb writing, I turned it off and felt annoyed they had the audacity to insult the audience like that. Did a 13 year old write the script?",/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2020,camilla-988-333867,8," iÂ´m 46 and i loved it

30 July 2021,gem2070,2," Series may NOT LAST after annoying Season 2!
","In my generous opinion, Season 1 was pretty decent and I was even excited to watch Season 2, once it premiered on July 30th. However, after watching the first few episodes of Season 2, I became so irritated and disappointed of its storytelling and characters that I seriously debated on whether to continue watching till the last episode. It truly felt like the show and Netflix was insulting the intelligence of its audience.",/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2021,finaldestination-g,4," Season 1 is good, Season 2 is comedy bad
","What happened to season 2? The writing is worse than Riverdale, the acting is amateurish sometimes and OMG I can't deal with all the stupid turns and twists with this show! Season 1 was slow but okay, Season 2 OMG.",/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2021,knedb,2," Season 2... smh
",This second season is some of the worst writing that I've ever seen in tv show history. It's all over the place. The acting somehow gets incredibly worse too. I still can't get why these writers think a late 20s year old can pass for 16 years old. So freaking unbelievable... everything.,/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2020,debapratimch,8," Unrealistic at times; but thoroughly fun
","Outer Banks is perfect for a quarantined summer weekend watch. It will make you revisit your Scooby-Doo and Enid Blyton days. The thrill of sharing secrets with friends, the little subtleties of teen romance, and facing your challenges as you step into adulthood will give you a nostalgic trip down memory lane.",/review/rw7188598/?ref_=tt_urv
