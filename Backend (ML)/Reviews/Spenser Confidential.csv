15 June 2014,hitchcockthelegend,9," You are not hardcore unless you live hardcore.
","The perfect vehicle for Jack Black, a film to show that given the right material he's a bona fide comedic actor of some worth. Plot has Black as Dewey Finn, a wastrel musician who has no job prospects and who spends his time mooching off of his best mate Ned Sheebly (Mike White). When Dewey is fired from his rock band he's left in limbo and in danger of being homeless. But when he answers a phone call offering Ned a job assignment, Dewey decides to take it upon himself to impersonate Ned and take the employment himself; as a schoolteacher!",/review/rw1188475/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2004,Chris_Docker,7," Unbelievably - does what it says on the packet
","A quick glance at the story or trailer tells you that School of Rock is probably the cheesiest, gratuitous, airhead excuse for a movie in ages, but if you thought that was a good reason to avoid it you'd be wrong. Jack Black plays the slightly past it rocker, stuck in a groove of 70s heavy metal rock and roll and refusing to move on  until his (more up to date) band fire him. Struggling to pay the rent, he takes a phone call intended for his schoolteacher flatmate and accepts a job as supply teacher at a top school. Soon he has the kids not only studying the history of rock and roll, soundproofing the room and playing rock instruments, but actually competing in a major Battle of the Bands' competition.",/review/rw1188475/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2003,ferguson-6,8," Jumpin' Jack Black, It's a Gas, Gas, Gas
","Greetings again from the darkness.  With so few good comedies these days, it was pure joy to laugh out loud a few times during this Jack Black showcase. Is he over the top? Absolutely.  Is his humor and delivery similar to the great John Belushi?  Yes, down to the arching eyebrows.  And I say SO WHAT? Jack Black is hilarious in this movie and director Richard Linklater (the underappreciated gem ""Dazed and Confused"") uses his spot-on observations of Rock music and school days to deliver a wonderful film going experience. Writer Mike White (""The Good Girl"") also plays Black's wimpy friend and former bandmate.  Although his acting is fine, it is White's writing that will make him rich in Hollywood.  The kids in the band are wonderfully cast and appear to be very talented musically as well.  Special recognition to Joan Cusack, who just nails the role of the uptight private school principal who is just itching to be unleashed.  I would have enjoyed a bit more of the Rock History tossed in for the sake of today's youngsters, but the tributes to Pete Townsend, Jimi Hendrix, Zeppelin and the Ramones are much appreciated.  Look for Nikki Katt in a brief role, but mostly just sit back and enjoy a pure comedy that truly ROCKS!!",/review/rw1188475/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2003,Wizard-8,," Maybe it's not intelligent - but it's funny and it rocks!
","Glancing at what other people have written about this movie, it seems that these individuals are taking this film a bit too seriously. Worrying about the ""messages"" this movie is delivering? Come on, there is no way that the con that Jack Black's character pulls off could ever get far in the real world! I don't think any sane person watching this movie would take this seriously. This is a comedy, for crying out loud, made to make us laugh!",/review/rw1188475/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2005,claudio_carvalho,8," Tailored for Jack Black
","After being fired from his own band, the guitar player Dewey Finn (Jack Black) needs to raise some money to pay for his rent and his bills. When his friend and school teacher Ned Schneebly (Mike White) is called to a temporary work in an expensive private school, Dewey pretends to be Ned and accepts the job. He finds talented young musicians in his class, and he decides to form a rock-and-roll band with the students and win a competition called ""Battle of Bands"" to raise the prize and be recognized in the show business.",/review/rw1188475/?ref_=tt_urv

10 June 2014,kennethraine,10," brilliant
","When I first watched this film I did not know what to expect. But was entertained and delighted by its content and spirit. My first thought was how come nothing quite like this has ever been attempted before. It had all the elements that go to make a great story,the enthusiasm of a yet to make it musician, a responsive youthful group of teenage, gifted but unrealised musicians, a controlling, misguided, but persuadable Establishment, and in the blend, the unauthorised teacher of the group nearly discredited. To top it all a contest was entered by this new group of hopefuls, and after initial resistance and disappointment, a final electric performance, gave them all the prize they deserved. There,s only one thing left to say, ""they stuck it to the man"".",/review/rw1188475/?ref_=tt_urv

20 December 2004,Buddy-51,7," Black attack
","After distinguishing himself in any number of memorable supporting roles, Jack Black finally comes into his own in ""The School of Rock,"" a sporadically funny comedy that is part ""Sister Act"" and part genial spoof of all those movies about a ""super teacher"" who brings meaning and purpose to the lives of his students.",/review/rw1188475/?ref_=tt_urv

1 May 2015,thesar-2,8," Schooled
","For a movie that started off as clichéd as possible and just pure fantasy – this would NEVER happen – the move was one of those rare experiences that got progressively better and funnier. Sure, it kept its, ah-hem, theme, but it did improve and absolutely worth the whole experience to get to the finale. Not to mention, the kids did great in their roles. Butthat all said, overall, the number one best quality was Jack Black himself. His chemistry with the kids, his enthusiasm and belief in this, wasn't just charming and contagious, it was sorely welcomed in this kind of age-old comedy. My only regret: it took me this long to finally see it. In the great words of Kevin Carr: It totally ROCKED!",/review/rw1188475/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2004,Frettan,8," Great, hilarious performance by Jack Black
","Dewey Finn is a lazy freeloader and a guitarist in a rock band who plays gigs every night and sleeps every day, in his friend Ned Schneebly's apartment. One day as he shows up late for band practice he notices a new guitar player who is replacing him. Poor Dewey feels so bad about it and also about Ned and his girlfriend threatening to kick him out since he doesn't pay any of the bills. After a few days of trying to sell his guitars, which doesn't go very well, the head of a school calls and asks for Ned Schneebly, who is a talented substitute teacher with a good reputation. In a desperate attempt to getting money fast, Dewey impersonates Ned and conveniently finds himself the teacher of a third grade ( or something like that ) class for several weeks ahead. Yet another one of his crazy ideas strikes him and his plan to turn his class into a rockband to win the Battle of the Bands competition is set in motion. ",/review/rw1188475/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2006,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," Unbelievable, this was such an awesome movie!
","School of Rock, well, it rocked! I had to say that I had my doubts, I mean, I love Jack Black, but this seemed like most of his movies where he just plays the typical junkie and probably has either the same or lame humor. Don't get me wrong, I love Jack, just I was starting to get worried about him being type cast. But School of Rock proved not only to be great, but an incredibly touching movie with some great humor.",/review/rw1188475/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2020,briancham1994,7," Better than I thought
","I avoided this film for years because I thought it would just be Jack Black being loud and overbearing. Luckily, he managed to exceed my expectations. He plays a genuinely lovable character in an equally heartwarming story. It's really much better than I expected.",/review/rw1188475/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2021,gianmarcoronconi,8," Film for family
",This is a very good family film based on the commitment with which everyone can realize their dreams and it is generally very nice although in my opinion in the long historydoes a little and the final is pretty obvious but otherwise it's quite fun and exciting.,/review/rw1188475/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2006,jakemsn4,10," Sound of Music
","Has anyone noticed that School Of Rock is like a modern, rock version, and 10-millions times better version of Sound Of Music? Both are about a teacher who spends time with a small group of kids and inspires true music in them. Anyone who is 50-90 years old loves the Sound of Music, as a member of the younger generation today I think it's safe to say The School of Rock is the ""Sound of Music"" version of the new millennia, because I doubt another movie in the next 100 or maybe even 1000 years with the same plot (teacher inspiring kids with music) will do better than School Of Rock, just like no movie between 1900-2000 did better than the Sound Of Music in this regard.",/review/rw1188475/?ref_=tt_urv

7 September 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," Time to have comedy fun with the School of Rock!
","The School of Rock is an enormously entertaining feel-good family film, that is nigh on perfection. The story is great, and doesn't preach in any way, and Jack Black, who I like, although I hated NeverEnding Story 3 which had him in(and wasted him), is outstanding as Dewey Finn, an ex-rocker who is hired as a substitute teacher at a prep school. Joan Cusack gives a very good account of herself as the prim and proper headmistress, and all the children, whom Dewey accidentally discovers their musical talents give strong performances too. The soundtrack is awesome, and the script verges very often to hysterically funny, with some undertone of sensitivity. There are one or two slow bits in the middle half, other than that, it is an exhilarating and hugely enjoyable comedy film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw1188475/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2005,teleadm-persson,8," This must be one of the best ""feel good"" movies ever!
","I'm just like the pupils in this movie! I know nothing about Hard rock, Heavy Metal, or Led Zepelin! But still! This is as good as a ""feel good"" movie can ever be! Can Jack Black ever top this? One of the few movies that I wish was 15 minutes longer. And those kids! They are marvelous! not like the typical kids in movies (With huge crocodile tears). Snow White and the seven Dwarfs, modernized. Jack Black was throwned out into the world because a rock band thought he was too wild. Snow White Was throwned out of a castle because she was too beautiful, by an evil stepmother (or a boring ego tripped band leader, or a step-mother using witchcraft). Jack Black found new faith and hope and energy in all those pupils (Snow White found the same in the seven dwarfs)",/review/rw1188475/?ref_=tt_urv
