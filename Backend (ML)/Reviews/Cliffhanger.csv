29 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,8," Solid Legal Thriller!
","Goliath is a pretty solid legal thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout every season. As always, Billy Bob Thornton was terrific. He has proven time and time again to be a very good actor and this actually might be his best role of his career. Well, at least one of them anyways. Each episode ends leaving you wanting more. There are plenty of twists and turns during each season and they all pay off in the end. This series isn't anything that's not been done before, this show just does it little better. If you're into legal dramas and haven't seen this yet then I definitely would recommend giving this a chance. You won't be disappointed!",/review/rw8640164/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,8," Worth Watching
",Goliath was such a good show. I'm actually mad at myself for putting it off for so long and just now watching it. I just finished season one and can't wait for the next three. If they're half as good as this first season I'll be satisfied. Billy Bob Thornton was perfect for this role. It's about a once powerful lawyer named Billy McBride (Thornton) who's now an ambulance chaser and a drunk. He takes a wrongful death lawsuit against his old firm which he helped create. He's then in a life or death trial against his old firm who he wants revenge against and the conspiracy behind it. I couldn't get enough of this and binged it as quickly as I could.,/review/rw8640164/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2016,Tactrix,10," Billy Bob Kills It
",First let me say that billy bob was built for this role. Picking him was the obvious choice because there is almost no one that can play a washed up brilliant drunk the way he can.,/review/rw8640164/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2016,feelinesound,9," One of the best dramas I've seen this year
","Binged-watched this one in 3 days and it was an absolute pleasure. It's not that the story itself is so thrillingly addictive, but mainly that almost all of the main characters are so fascinating, well crafted and brilliantly performed that you just keep wanting to go back and discover more about them. All of them deeply flawed, and yet vividly human and (for the most part) to at least some extent likable. Furthermore, the sheer amount of fully fleshed out, round and interesting characters that the show manages to create and build in just one 8-episode season is seriously impressive - there must be around 10 main supporting characters and by the end none of them feel under- served.",/review/rw8640164/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2018,billking6666,7," Season 2 a disapointment
","Spoiler. The first Season knocked it out of the park, but Season 2 is substandard. The worst part is the coincidence of an innocent kid going to the crime scene, with the intention of gunning down those who were gunned down by somebody else (on the same night, at the same exact time, on video) was too hard to handle. It was probably the most contrived plot setup I have ever seen. Thornton is great, but I hope the rest of the writing will not continue on this level of absurdity.",/review/rw8640164/?ref_=tt_urv

",Billy Bob Thornton - what a powerhouse actor. Now before I watched this I only knew that he was going to be in it. And some of the regulars of the show: I did not really know them.

","I've been a fan of Goliath seasons 1 and 2, that's why I'm enthusiastic about the latest season 3. But what's going on? I've been halfway thru the season and yet nothing's happened, except, the main characters getting drunk and getting high !
I'm disappointed, really. I felt I just wasted my time watching it. Sorry.",/review/rw8640164/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2021,rogerflores-41611,9," Secret Gem of a show
","Amazon smartly released all 8 episodes of Goliath so you could binge and follow the full arc of the story in a continuous setting. Goliath doesn't bury the lead by making you watch 7 episodes before stuff happens. Crucial elements of the story are revealed quickly and consistently and still it goes a full 8 episodes. Billy Bob Thornton just absolutely crushes it with his unique voice. Combined with Nina Arianda, it may have the best acting on TV that seems to never get noticed.",/review/rw8640164/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2016,bartleby56,9," don't let perfect be the enemy of good...
","I'm not into courtroom dramas, & I don't have a particular interest in procedurals of any stripe. I did find ""Goliath"" to be very involving and entertaining. There are some clich√©d tropes, as there are to some extent in ALL narrative fiction: the wastrel who has squandered his position of privilege and is handed the means to his own retribution, the big bad corporation pitted against the little guy, the 11th hour testimony to save the day for the plucky litigants...these contrivances in no way detract from what is at heart a good story with vivid, lifelike characters who suffer real consequences. There are a few ""types"", characters who fulfill a narrative function, but if you're THAT hung up on purity, screw it; you shouldn't be watching television, you should be writing stories and making your own truthful narratives. This is quality entertainment, and easily the best thing I've watched recently. Billy Bob Thornton is perfect, the supporting cast is top- notch, and while it does follow some genre formulae...it's artfully rendered GENRE, people. I suspect that the person complaining that it wasn't up to the standards of Chandler or Connelly (WTF?) suffers from ODC and likes having the last word in any discussion, whether it's regarding crime fiction or upholstery. I found it very entertaining.",/review/rw8640164/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2019,brian-milligan,3," Maddening...
","Season 3 is seriously the most annoying thing I've even watched. Brilliant lawyer Billy McBride, Who employs no security team, knows the people he's suing are bad yet he continues to stay in the hotel they own and they keep getting away with dosing his food and booze with hallucinogens. And hes too dumb to realize it. It's silly and no one would get away with it. That casino would be shuttered soon as they reported it to the FDA. On top of this the human body has defense mechanisms in place. 98 percent of the time you would know you have been drugged or someone close to you would and you could explain it. Moreover there are no such thing as warlocks. This show just doesn't know what it wants to be. It's a legal thriller, it's a comedy, its torture porn like in S2, it's a love story, its horror. It's all over the place and the viewer just gets fed up and turns it off. It also would be illegal for the most prominent rancher( who the county is named after) to be head of the water board making the case open and shut. It would literally take 2 mins in court. I could point out several more plot holes but why bother? How does this stuff get funded?",/review/rw8640164/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2019,fleck05IMDB,6," I Loved Season 1, Liked Season 2, Season 3 Is Okay
","Season one got me hooked - great David E Kelly storyline with Thorton against a ""Goliath"" had us rooting for Thorton and his groyp on dysfunctional minions.
Season two was weird and very dark, but okay. Mark Duplass is so likable he almost overcomes the creepy season two script.
But season 3 has lost it. They start with a great cast: Quaid, Bridges, Douglas, Brenaham, Greene, Sullivan and Dunne; but the story is predictable and uses a prism of drugs to create suspense. It's like Chinatown without the great writing. It feels like Kelly just phoned it in, which was really a bummer since I'd been looking so forward to the third season being great entertainment and making up for season two.
Maybe others will feel different, but I always expect great stories from David Kelly, but I feel like he missed the mark with season three.",/review/rw8640164/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2019,em-gliss,6," And it just keeps getting weirder.
","I'll keep this short. Season 1 was fantastic. Season 2 was one giant WTF, and not in a good way. And season 3 feels like they're ripping off Twin Peaks in terms of style and tone...and I'm only 2 episodes in.",/review/rw8640164/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2020,muamba_eats_toast,10," Absolutely fantastic
",The first season and third season in my opinion were absolute perfection. The third season ending in particular was one of my favourite season finales of all time. Season 2 was overly criticised by many and still very good although I'd personally give it an 8/10 rather than 10/10. Can't wait for season 4 although slightly gutted it will be the last!,/review/rw8640164/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2016,rareandfirsts,10," Knocking on Emmy's Door
","After only watching the first episode, I am seeing the possibility of an Emmy for For at least Billy Bob, Kelly and Bellow. Possibly Hurt and the writers. This seems to be one of the better streaming services or premium cable dramas to come across my screen in many months. I wasn't as tweaked about Goliath as I was Westworld, but after two episodes of Westworld and one of Goliath, my tastes say Goliath serves up a better dramatic dish to be savored rather than gulped down in shock scenes as in Westworld. I guess I prefer the story and character development over action. Guess I'm getting old. LOL.",/review/rw8640164/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2018,jolnugent,3," I wish I had not watched the 2d season.
","I have rarely written a review of any of Amazon's customarily excellent original series even though I usuaIly enjoy them immensely, like last year's 1st season of Goliath. I am an attorney and relish an intelligent and suspenseful legal drama. I so looked forward to the 2d season of Billy Bob Thornton as the jaded lawyer who dropped out of the profession only to be wooed back by his need to help the underdog facing his too-smart, too powerful colleagues in the legal (and not so legal) profession. So I binge-watched the 8-episode 2d season as soon as it was released. In the end, I was very disappointed. Not by the plot, which kept my attention. Granted, there were a few things (relationships mostly) that were supposed to be real head-turners that I guessed at and figured out before I should have. I could have handled that and still enjoyed the series without the need to write this review, but what I found despicable was, first of all, the periodic dismemberment of living human beings and, second, tying that to a sexual fetish. It was unnecessary, superfluous, meant to shock the unsuspecting viewer, which it did the first time, though merely repelled the 2d, 3d and 4th times, but did nothing to move the plot forward. In my humble opinion, It detracted from what could have been, in the hands of perhaps more skilled writers, an excellent characr study. I actually wish I had not watched it.",/review/rw8640164/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2016,jsaus63304,7," More great competition for the networks
","While this is not the best series I have seen from the alternate sources such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Showtime, HBO etc, it is a lot better than most of the shows that the networks have been pushing on us. I have only seen 4 or 5 of the 8 episodes so far, but it is getting better and better as the episodes progress. Competition like this can only make it better for those of us that like the episodic dramas like this one. I love a series that completes a season in 8-12 episodes and creates a new story line for the next season rather than leaving us with a cliff hanger or just canceling without closure. After stopping a lot of shows after watching less than a couple episodes, this one keeps you coming back.",/review/rw8640164/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2019,Siddhartha14,5," Season 1: great, Season 2: yawn, Season 3: hot mess
","This show started off great. You almost can't go wrong with Billy Bob Thornton leading the charge. I was really looking forward to Season 3 as Season 2 was quite disappointing. Season 3, hard to describe other than a hot mess. It's just awful. I was embarrassed for all of the actors involved in Season 3, most of whom did not deserve to be in this total disaster and meltdown of a show that started off great.",/review/rw8640164/?ref_=tt_urv

","Nina Arianda's performances as Patty Solis-Papagian are just brilliant. What a talented actor. I totally believed every word and every look/reaction. Just outstanding.
