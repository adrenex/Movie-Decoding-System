21 December 2019,Cylac,10," Amazing story!
",What an amazing film/story of this remarkable dog named Togo. I watched this film with my 11 year old daughter and we were both struggling to keep the tears ðŸ˜­ from falling. At the end my daughter was crying cause it was so touching. A REAL movie to watch!,/review/rw5595887/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,Bad-Good-Great,9," Fantastic! Absolutely fantastic!!
","This is the first time that I think Walt Disney Picture did a great job on this amazing movie. A movie that deserves to be called ""Mission Impossible!"" Willem Dafoe and Julianne Nicholson both are great. The screenplay writer Tom Flynn gave us a straightforward plot, simple but amazing scenario that has made this movie so suspenseful, thrilling, at the same time, profound. Director Ericson Core also won my praise wholeheartedly. The special effects team did a wonder too, many scenes I just couldn't believe possible to make, but they just looked so real and so powerful. The crossing lake scenes are just ridiculously fascinating. The leading dog's performance is just beyond any word could describe, and the poppy that played Togo's younger age would allow you to understand what ""cute"" really means. Willem Dafoe, what a great actor! Julianne Nicholson, her natural talent completely shinning through the whole movie. Every part of this movie is a fulfilled perfection, it also owes to the great casting job, through the lens of the camera, offering you great cinematography, followed by a perfect editing job....The almost impossible mission, the dogs, the great couple and the great town people...all together, have made this movie THE VERY BEST MOVIE at the year end of 2019.",/review/rw5595887/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2019,HoosierBob,9," A historical correction for true heroes!
","The wife and I watched this movie last night and were just blown away.
This is the true story of the sled dog team and it's owner who carried the medicine in Alaska to rescue Nome Alaska during he 1925 Diphtheria epidemic.
In much worse than normal blizzard conditions, the sled driver risked all to take a shortcut across a thawing body of water, thus saving 90 miles from his trip.
The movie reveals how the wrong dog, ""Balto"" was credited with the ordeal...and it is to the Disney studios for making the correction.
It reveals how even back then, the press was more eager to ""get the story"" than to ""get the facts"".",/review/rw5595887/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,WVfilmfem,10," Good to recognize Togo
","...as I've always heard only about Balto, who was commemorated. This is an excellent, heartfelt film, revealing the heroism of the dogs, particularly Togo.",/review/rw5595887/?ref_=tt_urv

18 April 2020,Lejink,8," Good to go Togo
","I admit it, I'm a sentimentalist. I cried like a baby at my own wedding while my wife looked on in bemusement. I weep at favourite songs or pieces of music and shed tears freely at emotionally charged movies. It was my wife's brother who recommended we watch this movie during lockdown and I really should have read the signs. First off it's a Disney movie, secondly it's about a brave dog ...and right from these two facts, I knew I was going to struggle to get through it dry-eyed.",/review/rw5595887/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2019,iamkeysersoze-13228,," As a person who dislikes dog related films, I loved this.
",Togo is the first win for Disney+ (in terms of movies) Togo is a legitimately great film and such a surprise. It is filled with a lot of heart and backed up by a great performance from Dafoe.,/review/rw5595887/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,apatil4,10," He is not a sled dog, he's the lead dog
","So let me guess if you have ever been a pet owner, I'm sorry, a dog owner and watch this movie you will probably cry like in every 10 minutes, maybe five",/review/rw5595887/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,recklessron,9," After thinking it over I can't find any flaws or things I would change - my highest rating ever
","If you are a dog lover this is a must-see film! In fact, unless you hate dogs, this is one of the best animal films I've ever seen. That includes Call of the Wild.",/review/rw5595887/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2019,ThomasDrufke,9," The Heart of a Survivor
","At this point, I don't care if every dog movie involves the same themes, emotional beats, or endings, if the movie sucks me in emotionally it will get my approval. Togo is a film that I was almost completely unaware of until a few weeks ago when I saw the trailer. A tale of bravery, loyalty, and an underDOG that was unfairly forgotten about for decades, Togo is one of the best films of the year no one is talking about. An absolute win on every level as Willem DaFoe and company prove there is still plenty of room for a dog movie in a crowded marketplace every once and again. Check that, I'll take one once a week.",/review/rw5595887/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,glenn-r-richardson,10," Togo tugs at the heart!
","With all the blockbusters being constantly cranked out for our consumption, it's great to come across a heartwarming story so expertly told. Once you realize this is a true story, it's even more amazing as you really can't believe the events actually happened. William Dafoe does a great job at playing a tough guy with a warm heart. You'll find yourself in awe of this true hero story and if you're like me you'll be choking back the tears. Great movie for the family. Enjoy.",/review/rw5595887/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,mikekelguard,10," Thought provoking
","My wife and I just finished watching this movie on Disney plus streaming services and upon completion I researched facts based on the film for the next hour. The movie was entertaining, with some comedy and drama. Based on the 1925 Nome Alaska diphtheria outbreak. The movie is factually based and it amazes me how the world got the story wrong for close to 100 years. I would highly recommend this movie for any family",/review/rw5595887/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2021,briancham1994,8," True appreciation of a dog's heroism
","Unlike the false sentimentality of Balto or Hachiko, this film shows the true heroism of a historic dog with all the nitty gritty details. The eponymous character is brave, energetic and loyal - but he is also mischievous, chaotic and stubborn. The relationship with Seppala is one characterised by both love and rebellion, befitting the true nature of a dog. Credit must be given to the filmmakers for the realistic and harrowing portrayal of a dog's tough journey through the brutal Alaskan winter. The flashbacks imparted a great deal of context and personality to Togo, which goes a long way when he can't speak!",/review/rw5595887/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2020,TheOneThatYouWanted,10," My dawg!
","No really, this is an actual great film to watch. Which is getting harder and harder to say these days with films made within the past 5 years or so. This film does it right, tells a story and builds on it with good acting and all the other things you need to help keep eyeballs and brains caring about what is in the screen. I will not spoil it for you, just watch it.",/review/rw5595887/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's 1925. Leonhard Seppala (Willem Dafoe) drives his dog sled home to Nome, Alaska and his wife Constance (Julianne Nicholson) ahead of an epic storm. The team is led by his beloved lead dog Togo. There is a diphtheria outbreak which threatens the town's children and there is only one man who can travel the distance to retrieve the needed serum.

2 April 2022,chrisflasheart,10," Magnificent Film
","Good acting, good pace, more than a Dog film. Rare too from Disney these days as it has no propaganda. Warning its emotional but well worth it. If you loved this film it worth looking up the story after as some of it is even more amazing in reality.",/review/rw5595887/?ref_=tt_urv

",Just an incredible movie. I can't say enough about how enjoyable this was. After the movie I had to research all about Togo and the great run. One I must highly recommend to all.,/review/rw5595887/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2020,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," An incredible true story, told perfectly.
","Stunning landscapes, excellent cinematography, outstanding directing and a perfect performance by all cast, including the dogs. Willem Dafoe and Togo's bond felt genuine. The 113 min run-time felt a little long, maybe should've been shortened by 15-20 mins and/or the pacing picked up. Otherwise, an incredible true story, told perfectly. A must-see and a deserving 9/10 from me.",/review/rw5595887/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2020,eddie_baggins,9," A fantastic surprise. One of the best Disney film's in years!
","Arriving without much fanfare or expectation to the recently made available Disney + streaming service, you'd not be the only one heading into Togo with zero to minimal hopes for a film that on paper seems like the perfect middle tier type production, but throwing those feelings out the window is a dog-centric true life tale that is some of the best original work The Mouse House has done in the last decade.",/review/rw5595887/?ref_=tt_urv
