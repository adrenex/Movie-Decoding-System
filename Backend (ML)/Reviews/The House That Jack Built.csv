","I wasn't sure what to expect when I watched this movie. I was sure quite how it would fit with the Dirty Dancing title, but once I turned it on I was enraptured. I couldn't turn away and when it was over and watched it a second time.",/review/rw1832322/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2005,el_nickster,1," Bogus Latin dancing film.
","My biggest gripe with this movie is that the Latin dancing is not very genuine. My father was living in Havana in the early 1960s, and reports what seems pretty obvious: this film is full of a modern, highly stylized and ""hip-hoppified"" version of Cuban street dancing.",/review/rw1832322/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2004,funky_little_angel,10," I enjoyed it
","When I went in to see Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, I expected it to be really bad with all the bad reviews labelling it as corny and ridiculous etc. So I was surprised when it turned out to be a better film that I expected. The acting was good and the dancing was hot. And even though the plot may have been unoriginal and predictable, nothing these days is really that new.",/review/rw1832322/?ref_=tt_urv

21 November 2004,kc_loves_movies,," This is awesome
","I absolutely LOVED this movie. Deigo Luna was so hot! This was not as good as the first, but considering it wasn't really a sequel but more like a completely different movie I thought it was awesome. The acting was good, the dancing awesome, and the soundtrack even better. I loved the dance they did at the Palace and I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. Both the lead actors are new and I hope that we will be seeing a lot more of each of them. This is a sweet story of an interacial relationship in Cuba where the white girl from America falls in love with the sexy Cuban pool boy! They are so awesome together and it was a wonderful movie. With the sexy dancing and the sexy music and the typical(but good) storyline this is the perfect movie to watch anytime!",/review/rw1832322/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2005,Markussen_malene,9," I had the time of my life again!
","Katey moves to Havana with her family in 1958. Her family expect her to date a rich buy, but then she meets the Cuban waiter Javier, he introduces her to the sensual Cuban dance'n'music. When he loses his job, indirectly because of Katey, she asks her to enter and win a dancing competition with her, so that he can take his family to America. They meet secretly and dance right in each others hearts! When the revolution breaks out, the young couple tries to prove that their love is worth fighting for. I would have liked them to just call it Havana Nights, instead, because many people have high expectations about it because of the title. If you liked the first Dirty Dancing you will love this. It is a beautiful movie about how dancing brings to young people together and mix the afro-Cuban rhythms with ballroom dance and it looks fantastic! I LOVE this movie, and the music is absolutely amazing! It makes you want to dance and I feel alive when I see the movie. If you want to have a big musical experience filed with love and drama, then enjoy every minute of this film! I hope you will let yourself flowed away to the Cuban music!",/review/rw1832322/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2005,Soccer_800,9," I LOVED Dirty Dancing Havana Night's
","I loved this movie! It was really good. Yes it was a chick flick and a teen movie, but it was SO good and romantic! Javier (Luna) was SO hot and good. The way his body moved was amazing! The only reason I rated this movie a 9 was because I didn't like the way it ended. I thought it could have been done a little differently. But I still went out and bought the DVD!! This may sound a little crazy, but almost every night I watch it! If I could learn to dance the way they do...I would pay to learn how to dance so Cuban! It was a really good, adorable, romantic, and dramatic Movie. It had everything and more that I like to see in a movie. Many people say that they didn't like it but, I thought it was awesome.",/review/rw1832322/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2004,willow_tree-1,10," Feel the rhythm of the beat!
","This movie is now without a doubt on my top 10 list now! The mix of drama, romance, history, and dance is perfect! The acting, dancing, and music in the movie was great! You want to just stand up and dance (even if you have no idea how to) Havana nights really takes you into the lives of these two people and makes you really care about them. It has an ending that is very true to real life. That things don't always go as they should. It had a Romeo and Juliet vibe without being cheesy what so ever. Diego and Romola give a heart warming performance that makes you always want to come back for more. I recommend this movie to anyone that has ever wanted to follow their dreams, but was too afraid to try.",/review/rw1832322/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2007,Chrysanthepop,," Romola Garai, Soundtrack & Dances!
","Normally, I avoid these kind of films as romantic movies aren't my cup of tea or coffee. However, while i was working, the movie was playing and I was captured by the beauty of Romola Garai. So I decided to watch the film. There were some great foot-tapping songs and the dances were fairly good too. There's nothing like dancing with a beautiful woman (who can dance too). The film itself is quite okay, nothing outstanding. The lead pair Diego Luna and Romola Garai share a nice chemistry. Not only is Garai beautiful but she can act too as she delivers a sincere performance. Diego Luna does his part well although in a few scenes he does seem to have difficulty with some expressions. Sela Ward is alright in a minuscule part. Ditto for Patrick Swayze's cameo.To sum it up, what I liked about it was Romola Garai, the soundtrack and the dances.",/review/rw1832322/?ref_=tt_urv

","We were excited to see this long overdue sequel to the original Dirty Dancing. When we were done, we could not believe how badly it was made. I know it is cheaper to make films out of the United States now as this one was done in Australia. Problem is it looks like it was done by some blokes who didn't care about even trying to make a good movie.",/review/rw1832322/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film is a sequel to ""Dirty Dancing"", hoping to capitalize on the popularity of the original. It utilizes much of the original plot and has numerous references to the action, but viewers need to decide if this is a loving nod to the original DD or an unnecessary redo (or both).

23 February 2005,Naisy68,8," Very good movie
","I rented this movie the other day simply because I wanted to see how they could possibly do a sequel to the first Dirty Dancing. However, I don't think I would have otherwise. BUT I am really glad that I did. I loved this movie! I really liked the story line and it also gave me a brief glimpse of the history of Cuba. That in itself made it one of my new favorite movies. Combine this with the music and the awesome dancing and it becomes a fantastic movie. I am not going to compare it to the first DD movie. It deserves to be set out on it's own. It is definitely worthy. The young actors do an awesome job of portraying the characters in this movie. This is a movie that I would like to own and I don't feel that way about a lot of movies. Congratulations to the producers, directors and all of those involved, I will be recommending this one to friends and family.",/review/rw1832322/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2011,john-mitchell77,," What's New?
","Now, I liked Dirty Dancing. I'm not ashamed to admit that. It had quotable lines like: ""My God, it's Cleopatra! I feel like such an asp!"" and ""Oh, come on, ladies! God wouldn't have given you maracas if He didn't want you to shake 'em!"" and, of course, the iconic ""Nobody puts Baby in a corner!"" and the dancing was spot on. The plot had been seen before in a thousand incarnations, but I thought it wasn't bad. So, when a sequel was mentioned, I was quite intrigued. What was there left to say? Answer: Absolutely zippo! It's the same flippin' movie! Same characters (although with different names) and same plot. It's not even disguised, or if it was, it failed miserably. This is a clunky, needless rehash. It's pretty terrible. Nice to look at, admittedly and the soundtrack's not bad, but other than that, pointless.",/review/rw1832322/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2004,hanleybmw,4," Not ALL bad, but not good....
","OK, this is not a good movie....but it's not ALL bad. Patrick Swayze looked decrepit in this movie, totally irrelevant to the plot (some sort of editing issues). This is the only movie I have ever seen in theaters that people (basically most of the audience) were laughing during the dramatic parts. I have to say I liked some of the aesthetics but overall the schmaltzy acting and flimsy plot really killed it. The music was not even trying to be 50's era in many places and most of the characters were hardly developed at all but seemed to be just thrown in. I realize that this isn't exactly supposed to be groundbreaking cinema, but given the popularity of the first movie I would have expected better.",/review/rw1832322/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2005,jotix100,1," Rip off
","""Dirty Dancing, Havana Nights"" is a film that tried to capitalize on a much better film, ""Dirty Dancing"" that came out in the eighties. This remake suffers from a lack of vision and political incorrectness, so typical with people that have no clue about other cultures, as witnessed by the finished product. It's almost incomprehensible that more than 500 contributors to IMDb have given this film a rating of 10, or excellent, when it feels fake from the beginning.",/review/rw1832322/?ref_=tt_urv

","In November 1958, the American teenager Katey Miller (Romola Garai) moves with her parents and her younger sister to Havana. Her father is an executive of Ford expatriated to Cuba, and Katey is an excellent high school senior student that misses her friends. The family is lodged in a fancy hotel, where Katey accidentally meets the local teenage waiter Javier Suarez (Diego Luna). Later she sees Javier dancing in a public square and they become friends, but he is fired from the hotel because her acquaintances have seen them together. Katey invites Javier to participate of a Latin Ballroom Contest in the local Palace club to help him to raise some money, and she secretly meets him in the La Rosa Negra nightclub for rehearsals.

9 May 2004,Minerva_Meybridge,," Prounounce her ROMohluh Gary and keep a close watch!
","The film is mindless escapism.  But Romola Garai is the one to watch.  She has starred in three major releases abroad: Daniel Deronda, Kate Nickleby and I Capture the Castle.  Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, a film that was obviously anticipated for box office weakness; else why tie to a 17 year old film?  But it helped to mainstream Romola Garai in American and will undoubtedly serve as a stepping stone toward larger and better projects.  It is a shame that American tend not to view British film making on the whole.  Take Lord of the Rings and Peter Pan and Underworld as examples; carefully crafted, wonderful cinematography.  But I digress.  Keep Romola Garai in a mind's eye view for what she will accomplish later on.",/review/rw1832322/?ref_=tt_urv

","Can a gifted young actress ever be too good for the part? Yes, if you're talking about this pleasantly bland DIRTY DANCING sequel. HAVANA NIGHTS tries to transplant the ""Dirty Dancing"" story line to Cuba in the fifties. It's a good idea in itself. But the movie doesn't work because Romola Garai is not just good enough -- she's too good. She's too natural, too glamorous, too self-confident, and too alluring to be believable in the typical ""dirty dancing"" scenario.",/review/rw1832322/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2013,noradorian,1," simply awful
","I'll be brief. I waisted too much time watching this, so I won't waist even more writing a long review. I gave a star because I liked the Cuba song, but that's it. For the rest, such a bad bad bad... EVERYTHING: casting, choreography, acting, directing...etc etc... I wonder what Patrick Swayze had to do with this pathetic imitation of a wonderful memory. They could have picked up another actor, same category with the rest just to fit with their script and leave Patrick S. alone. It was very very disappointing. I could watch ""Dirty Dancing"", the original one, endlessly ... but this Havana thing... I made a big effort to resist watching it till the end... If you want to see a good movie, pick up the first Dirty Dancing. Simply like that.",/review/rw1832322/?ref_=tt_urv

Diego Luna was hot and fabulous oh my god! He is an unbelievable dancer...give him props, CHECK OUT THIS MOVIE!I liked the fact that they brought in Patrick Swayze (NICE TOUCH) kinda made it corny but funny.

11 November 2012,boldentommy,1," Like putting a turd in a fan
","OHHHH BOY! Last night while sitting on the couch my wife comes to me and says, I want to watch a movie. Of course I am fair game for this notion and since it was her birthday I let her pick. Worst mistake of my life, she picks dirty dancing Havana nights. This film is asstastic and I don't mean that in a good way. OK lets start with the characters, flat, dull, tasteless, stereotypical, pathetic, and just plain bad. That's just not for one person in this movie thats for them all. This movie is mixed bag of garbage, its like my mom dumped the litter box(characters), used tampons (story), then my brother vomits in the same bag(music). I just cant get over the acting, the lead male in this movie is so laughable. At one point I thought he was trying his best SNL tryout for a Cuban impersonation. Now the thing that really grinds my gears are the parents. I just cant get over how stupid they are. The mom plays this uptight rich woman who falls right into ever category that every other rich movie mom falls into. She wants her daughter to screw this other rich kid so her dad can keeps his job. What a selfish bitch. When she discovers that her kid isn't sleeping with the man she wants her too, she slaps the taste out of her mouth. What kind of crazy person is this. Then towards the end of the movie she basically tells her daughter to go sleep with this guy before (spoiler) something happens and they have to leave Cuba. Now the dad this guy beats me up the most. The actor doesn't even try to play the dad figure he basically plays a flat person who's name is dad.The most laughable moment in the whole movie is when he see's his daughter dance with the lead guy and he touches her breasts. He has this look on his face like he just got done watching porn. I am not kidding. The other story that is going on is that president Batista (not the wwe wrestler), is a mean guy who has Cuba in a death grip. Now the lead man and his family are trying to help get Fidel Castro into power. Yeah that worked out well didn't it. THey use this to build a tasteless love story basically of a guy who helps lead in the overthrowing of a government and stealing of a girls vcard. I cant go anymore into this movie if this doesn't turn you away I don't know what will.",/review/rw1832322/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2004,Hoohawnaynay,," Great Music but thin plot!
","This movie really has nothing to do with the first one except a cameo by Patrick Swayze.  The dancing was quite good for non-professional dancers but the music was REALLY good even though they had nothing like that in 1958! Extremely thin plot and rushed paced with little character development but that would have probably gotten in the way and made the movie longer and more boring.  Sela Ward adds class to anything she does and she adds charisma to this movie.  Diego Luna even though not of typical matinee idol looks has tons of charisma and lights up every scene he is in.  Mika Boorem is also turning into quite a beauty as evident here.  If you want to hear some great music then by all means see this and enjoy, just don't think too hard about the plot, there isn't much to work with.",/review/rw1832322/?ref_=tt_urv

","I find it strange that the trailers and titles read Introducing Romola Garai, who is already quite accomplished, having starred in Daniel Deronda, Nicholas Nicklby and I Capture the Castle, where she demonstrated a tremendous range in acting.  Each of those, however, were British films, which most of mainstream America wouldn't dream of noticing. Let me just say that they were comparable to Shakespeare in Love.  I guarantee, though, unless her career takes a nosedive to high-budget, low cal Am flicks, she's going to be nominated and win an Academy Award for some future performance.  She is truly a fine actress.",/review/rw1832322/?ref_=tt_urv

It seemed as if things were just thrown in this movie just for the sake of it with no real fluidity. I was never expecting much.
