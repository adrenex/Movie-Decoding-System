25 December 2021,deloudelouvain,8," Gripping story from writer/director/lead actor Justin Chon.
","Justin Chon did a great job with this one. It's not often you get a director/writer/lead actor in a movie but he did all of those and it was all very well done. The story is poignant, quite incredible that something like this is even possible in real life, but it is sadly the reality, and that in a country that wants to be the example for the rest of the world. To be honest I found this incredibly sad, and that in the land of the free, in the land of opportunities. Justin Chon is not only a good writer but he was also very convincing in his role as the American-Korean. The rest of the cast were also very good playing their respective characters, especially the young Sydney Kowalske. She played very natural, almost like she wasn't acting, and that's not given to a lot of child actors. Blue Bayou isn't a movie that will leave you with a smile, and that's good, because these kind of stories are still happening now, and a smile would just be wrong when you think about all the lives that have been destroyed.",/review/rw7384729/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2021,paul-allaer,7," Intense family drama is likely to raise the hairs on your arms
","""Blue Bayou"" (2021 release; 116 min.) brings the story of Antonio Leblanc. As the movie opens, Antonio is interviewing for a job and turned down. From the interview we learn that he was born in Korea and adopted at a young age by a family in Louisiana. Antonio is married to Kathy, who is highly pregnant with the couple's first child (Kathy has a young daughter Jessie from a prior marriage). Kathy's ex is a New Orleans cop. One day, he and another cop harass Kathy and end up viciously beating and arresting Antonio, who before we understand what is happening is facing deportation to Korea... At this point we are 15 min into the film but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing exprience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw7384729/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2022,eddie_baggins,8," A powerfully performed human drama
","His biggest film yet in a career that still feels as though its only just beginning, actor, Youtuber and director Justin Chon delivers his biggest project yet in the form of the New Orleans set immigration themed drama Blue Bayou, a familiar feeling character drama that is nevertheless an effective and emotionally engaging experience with great performances from the multi-tasking Chon and the radiant Alicia Vikander.",/review/rw7384729/?ref_=tt_urv

14 October 2021,atractiveeyes,8," Great
","This is a nice emotional family drama. Its story is beautiful, real, sad, and heartbreaking. It also tackles an important topic and spreads awareness about a serious issue. My only issue with it is that it has many subplots that makes it a bit distant and messy sometimes. Performances are solid by both Chon and Vikander.",/review/rw7384729/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2021,vovers1,8," Wow - Watch it
","What a beautiful and poignant story. The characters are real, tugs at the heartstrings and lays bare the total lack off empathy in the modern immigration processes. The fact that it depicts real life anguish makes this film signifficant. I really hope it can pass it's message to millions and help to tear down the wall.",/review/rw7384729/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2021,jamuckley,8," Powerful and Moving American Tragedy

",Instant reaction here. Was blown away by this movie. Not overly familiar with Justin Chon but his performance was exceptional and seeing he also wrote and directed this makes me excited for whatever projects he's involved with in the future. Alicia Vikander was solid as always great casting and most importantly the movie raises awareness to an issue most people were likely unaware of. Bravo!,/review/rw7384729/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2021,li0904426,10," A powerful and beautiful piece of art!!!
","Well written, performed and directed movie!! Blue Bayou is one those movies that catch you for the simplicity, humility and empathy of a well written story. It shows ordinary people that suffer for the consequences of poor justice, political games and a bureaucratic system.",/review/rw7384729/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2021,tccandler,9," A small gem with superb performances...
",A visceral and cinematic peek into the absurd and cruel deportation policy in the USA with regards to adopted children. Justin Chon and Alicia Vikander are superb as the central married couple who are being torn apart by the barbaric system. This is a small gem.,/review/rw7384729/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am not familiar with american laws but I can't understand how a legally adopted child doesn't have an american citizenship, or why such person as an adult doesn't apply for a citizenship?",/review/rw7384729/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2021,guskeller,8," An emotional punch
","Passion runs deep in Blue Bayou. The story is simple and classic, but potent. Fundamentally, Blue Bayou is about a man who loves his family and is faced with an insurmountable obstacle. Urgent political themes, like racism and classism, are driving forces here, but this film hinges on the love between our protagonist and his adopted daughter. That is why praise must begin with Justin Chao, Alicia Vikander, and Sydney Kowalske for delivering beautiful performances that truly portray a loving family dynamic.",/review/rw7384729/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2021,kenzibit,8," Struggles of Man.
","This movie is for some family time, very emotional and will make you think about life of a man if you want everything and everyone in your life feel safe. This plot is very deep and multi-faceted. It has some teary scenes and does a wonderful job of puting you in the seat of the actors. Performances were top notch and very convincing... story just didn't end the way I wanted sadly but highly recommend this for the family.",/review/rw7384729/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2021,studioginger,8," What a truly heartfelt moment

29 September 2021,masonfisk,6," TOO MUCH PLOT FOR ONE MOVIE...!
","A large heart on your sleeve domestic drama from this year starring Justin Choi (who also wrote & directed). Choi opens the film trying to get a second job (he's a tattoo artist) since his wife, played by Alicia Vikander (who I think is in the third film I've seen her in, in the last few weeks), is about to have his baby while they're raising her child from her previous marriage (she was married to a cop). He has a checkered past (he's a Korean immigrant who was adopted by shitty parents, has had run-in's w/the law, etc.) & things are looking bleak since he got into it w/the same ex-wife cop & his partner & arrested where he's informed he's primed to be deported even though he's been living in the States since he was three. As the ever increasing, densely plotted narrative marches on (which includes Choi befriending a Vietnamese woman dying of cancer, his inner turmoil in asking his adoptive mother for help, his need to raise money for his attorney, played by Vondie Curtis-Hall, etc.) we are soon inundated by a TV series' season worth of plots that in a 2 hour film gets capsized about an hour in as our Job like protagonist suffers all manner of injustices & obstacles sans floods, locusts & delinquent tax returns. Choi gives it his all but a little less on his plate would've stretched the cinematic meal a bit more evenly.",/review/rw7384729/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2021,frank-liesenborgs,8," ICE cold but blown away
","This is not just a story of a stepfather facing deportation. The movie shows an immigration system that can and will tear families apart. At the end of the movie where they show real-life cases of other unnaturalised adoptees who are either facing deportation or have been deported along with the estimates by the Adoptee Rights Campaign of international adoptees who face similar circumstances, thatÂ´s the part that hits you like a hammer.",/review/rw7384729/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2021,Boristhemoggy,8," One of the finest films about man's inhumanity to man made for a long time

27 September 2021,salramirezjr,7," Beautiful Story, but Lacking in Script Quality and Direction
","Blue Bayou is devastating throughout, depicting not only the main struggle of the film but of other social issues. Everyone in the cast does a great job, and Sydney Kowalske is often the star of the show. However, at times the script feels unpolished, and the amount of close-ups of an actor's face became nearly unbearable by the end.",/review/rw7384729/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2021,moviefan1987,6," Very moving, story could have been better
","Don't get me wrong, this is a powerful story shedding a light on the awful fate that some families live through. However, the story didn't need the second cop whatsoever. Without that character, I'd rate this a 7-8. His character was unnecessary and quite unbelievable, especially the pivotal scene with him near the end. At that point, I stopped caring for the movie due to how ridiculous it was. Outside of that, we enjoyed it.",/review/rw7384729/?ref_=tt_urv
