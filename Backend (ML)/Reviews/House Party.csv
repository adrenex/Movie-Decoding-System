","Those of us that understand the medical malpractice industrial complex, understand the issues raised in the documentary intimately. I'm so happy to see this documentary being reviewed on IMDB...It's so important for people to see...",/review/rw8720068/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2022,RodrigAndrisan,10," We need more films like this!
","The biggest purveyors of misinformation is government, media and the biggest frauds on the internet, the ""fact-checkers."" I waited 3 years to see such a film. Thanks to Stew Peters for giving me the opportunity to see it on his channel. I knew all these things because I investigated what happened in the world in the last three years, but I had not yet seen those huge ""calamari"" taken out of dead people. Those who wrote reviews saying that what is seen in the film is not true and that the film should be banned from everywhere online, are either idiots or, rather, they are on the side of those who want to drastically reduce the world's population, Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, George
Soros, Anthony Fauci, etc. Etc., the elite of the richest who are all followers with old service states of Eugenics. The story is not new and did not start 3 years ago. Population reduction has been predicted for a long time, see Henry Kissinger, the Rockefellers, the Rothchilds, etc. They should all be tried in a new Nuremberg and die in prisons. But how do you do that when they make the laws? They manipulate all heads of state and all governments. Only if the entire population of the world would
unite against them, carrying out a global revolution, in the style of the French revolution of 1789, with heads falling. Unfortunately, Stupidity is infinite and people are sheep. They will continue to watch TV and believe all the lies that are shoved down their throats in all the media, they will continue to trust governments and leaders, they will continue
to wear masks, get ""tested"" and they will continue to die injected with ""vaccines"" biological weapons.",/review/rw8720068/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2022,trumaneugene,10," WORTH THE TIME TO WATCH
","The haters of this documentary will automatically and expectedly tie it to the evil Donald Trump and/or MAGA supporters. But, if they would only try to be objective and take the information provided, with other alternative sourced information, they would be surprised by what is actually going on with the vaccine mandates. More and more information is coming out about the adverse side effects of the vaccines, and this is just another example. Why wait another ten years or more to accept they were bad for us, like pain killers? Stop putting all your trust in government and big pharma. One is abusing its power and one is making billions. Both are reaping the rewards of the sheep just blindly following along. Or, following along because ""their side"" is in charge.",/review/rw8720068/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2022,hansefde,8," Lots of unproven assumptions, but is it untrue?
","This documentary puts all sorts of strings together and it ends up into the realm of conspiracy theories. Is the vaccine a bioweapon, was it introduced to decrease the population, is it the UN/WEF/Gates agenda? I am not sure and there is no evidence either. BUT the data doesn't lie. Nor the obituaries in the newspapers. My local newspaper now is filled for 50% of obituaries. Unheard of. Also lots of pregnant women losing the baby, including famous ones. A 500% increase in dead athletes. It is clear the vaccines are to blame but the media is silent. That's why I am happy someone made this documentary to show what's going on despite not being 100% true. See it and judge for yourself. Big pharma is evil, I am sure of it.",/review/rw8720068/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2022,DaveMattia,8," Anecdotal? Maybe, but not everything is a conspiracy.
","This film can be easily dismissed as a conspiracy crackpot's dream, and if I were to see this at any other time in my life, I would have dismissed it like a Bigfoot movie filmed with night-vision goggles. Trouble is, I cannot dismiss this film because I know four relatively young and healthy men, each under 55, who died suddenly within the past year. One friend, found dead in his sleep. Another walking up the stairs to his home. Another at a restaurant. The other has yet to be explained to me. Naturally, one gets curious but so far so autopsy results have not been revealed or shared-- at least not to me. I don't expect family members to rush to tell me the cause of death because of privacy issues, but since most people instantly assume drugs or suicide, you'd think the families would tell you, ""No, it was not drugs,"" but they haven't. Do they themselves even know? Did they get a straight answer from a medical examiner? There is something odd about that no matter how you look at it. In fact, one of the dead didn't even get an autopsy. He was 52 and perfectly healthy. Found dead in his bed. Cause of death was chalked up as ""natural causes."" .Why do I personally know 4 young men who dropped dead in the past 18 months?",/review/rw8720068/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2022,undertaker2628,10," There are few better documentaries on the subject.
","This overview of the pandemic and its response is an unbiased analysis worthy of consideration and imperative to watch. You are not informed until you educate yourself on the good and bad. Is there good? Yes. Is there bad? Most certainly. Will you become well informed without personally seeking it? Sadly, no, you must be motivated to learn. You must take it upon yourself to learn lest you be brainwashed by the far right or left. This is a must watch but do not based your opinion on a single documentary, spend dozens of hours as a devil's advocate and perhaps you will be capable of making an informed conclusion.",/review/rw8720068/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2022,liam-06236,10," Not for the ""hard of thinking""
","Enough said. You can't fix stupid. You can't fix willfully blind and ignorant. If seeing this stuff with your own eyes doesn't wake you up, then all I can say is that you should continue to disbelieve your lying eyes. When I saw the planes hit the towers and I saw a passenger airline fold itself into a 16 foot hole at the pentagon, I knew I was witnessing propaganda. When I saw them wheeling 2 gurneys with unexploded bombs out of the Alfred P Murrah building in Oklahoma City and witnessed Connie Chung getting de-platformed, I started waking up. I have been awake for this one from the beginning. Theory is something for which there is NO evidence. This is evidence. Wake up, stupid people! The rest of us are waiting for you.

17 December 2022,yannesbox-179-385862,10," Lots of cognitive dissonance amongst the viewers, of course...
","As one would expect, a shocking documentary like this divides people strongly. Many people will never accept the truth, not even during their ""last spasm""... I'm not surprised...
I think this was a very well made documentary, no matter what the skeptics and trolls say, and no matter how much the fake news media tried to debunk some of the material used in this film. The main focus should still be that; this is happening now, and people should wake up to the fact that this is going on, people are dying, and there is evidence, no doubt about that. I'm happy to see all this info in a well made package, and I have no problem in accepting it, i just choose to stay neutral about it, I see a positive side, and I believe that everything will turn around soon, and the world will become a better place. All this what's going on on the planet is a necessary step towards something better.",/review/rw8720068/?ref_=tt_urv

","Bravo for the brave writers and directors of this documentary. It is time for people to really talk about the possibilities of what is happening. Many will scoff at this and call it false information. It is time to educate and this is a step in the right direction to open the dialogue about it all. ""When he opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, ""Come!"" And I looked and behold a pale horse! And its rider's name was Death and Hades followed him.

","Finally, the facts are laid bare for all to see: vaccines are unhealthy. This is crucially important to vampires, because they, like every other US voter, deserve tasty and organic food options.

",A load of misinformation dressed up in high emotion so the gullible will believe. The idea that funeral directors can tell what causes any alleged blood clots are caused by is hilarious. Made by grifters to be watched by the gullible. Should be removed from all platforms asap as it's so factually inaccurate it's dangerous. They even contain reference to people who died before the vaccine programme or who aren't even dead at all. An embarrassment to documentary making.,/review/rw8720068/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2022,comicdet-85293,8," I watched the free version
","I find it difficult to believe that ""Died Suddenly"" has received only one review three days after its release despite seven million views and counting. The film addresses the agenda of globalists determined to simultaneously keep us at one another's throats so as to deflect attention from themselves, their suppression of narratives factual in nature and therefore antithetical to their ends (which is ultimately ours: population culling). That said, kudos to the producers for collating and editing the material as quickly as they have. There is an exigency driving that need, a need to have more people awakened to legitimate concerns and the posting of questions more legitimate than the answers we've been getting. I do wish that the film had offered some explanation for the fibrous clots shown on the film. How are they constituted? Any ideas how they are formed? How they might be mitigated? I am also concerned at the lack of context given some of the footage. Were all the people dropping actually dying? The last thing I want is for those having legitimate concerns impeaching their own credibility through innuendo or false assertions that relegate them to the same plane as the propagandists that fomented this mess. Also, greater explication should be given as to the role these billionaire elites and politicians have effected so many mandates, lockdowns, etc. I readily recommend this film as an introductory primer, but more heartily recommend people initiate their own research into the rabbit hole instead of just playing for ostrich depths.",/review/rw8720068/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2022,tfischer-71298,7," Watch with an open mind and take it with a grain of salt.
","This film is obviously anti-vax, at least when it comes to the covid vax, which I totally understand, as I've never been anti-vax myself until the covid vaccine. Something with it just doesn't sit right with me. Believe it or not, WE ARE THE TEST, and this vaccine was rushed into production. We will not know for sure the long lasting effects for years to come. That being said, it's obvious that the agenda is being pushed hard in the anti-vax direction. To be fair and transparent, after watching the film, I did some research to see what the other side of the aisle had to say about it. I read an article from McGill University which raised some issues with the film such as the film makers using a few clips of people suddenly passing out, pushing the assumption that they died had all died from the vax. As it turns out, according to this article, 1 of the clips was from before the vax was even out, and another clip where the girl fell into the train - she apparently had a fractured skull, but lived. This does NOT mean that the girl didn't collapse due to a vax issue, however, but I just wanted to point out some of the film's missing context. That being said, the film showed about 10 clips like this, and the article mentioned only debunked 2 of them, so there is still likely some truth on the film maker side in regard to the other clips, they just used a few clips not pertaining to the vax to fuel their agenda, which is a bit of a no-no. As the article mentioned, these people in the film doing most of the talking are embalmers. TECHNICALLY, this is a field of science, and not medical professionals, so I somewhat understand the argument from the other side of that aisle that embalmers are not educated enough on the topic. I also understand that clotting can happen before and after death, and that it's not uncommon. HOWEVER, when the stats are in front of your face during the film, so long as the presented data is accurate, it can't be swept under the rug. When you have exponentially higher sudden death rates and stillborn baby death rates and all these young athlete deaths topping new highs - all since the vaccine releases, it's hard not to connect the dots. Add to that the fact that all these embalmers are saying that they have never seen clots like this material before, or as large of clots, or as commonly - and now there's really some red flags, again, assuming what all these embalmers say is the truth. Then there's the film's depopulation theory. Personally, I feel like the world IS overpopulated, and I don't even live in a huge city. That being said, if any population control were to be implemented, I would say to slow births, not create more deaths. It wouldn't surprise me if there were some big depopulation conspiracy theory that has some level of truth to it, I just can't say for certain based off of the facts presented in this film. Basically, all said and done, I think if you're open minded, it's worth a watch. There's arguments to both sides, and even as someone who leans more to the right, I can see why some would say this is all just a conspiracy theory, but the other side of the aisle also hasn't debunked enough of this film, and the article I mentioned tries to link people dying now to people dying 10 years ago, then even comparing people to whales at one point. Lots of farfetched comparisons to try and prove statements in the film are wrong. This is how I end with a 7/10. I don't think it's completely cut and dry in either direction, but I wouldn't be surprised one bit if there were some truth behind all this, and I certainly wouldn't underestimate big pharma. At the end of the day, all we know is what we are told, and when you're told several different things about the same thing, it can be very hard to sift through the garbage in any hope to find the truth. All we can do is keep an open mind, watch from both sides of the aisle, and make the best decisions we can.",/review/rw8720068/?ref_=tt_urv

",I have one problem with a lot of commenters about this movie everyone wants to think that apparently You won't drop dead randomly from the vaccine potentially Even over a course of time they like to blame it on covid And yet to my knowledge almost nobody in fact I've never heard of a single case of someone that was unvaccinated randomly dropping dead of a heart attack while being healthy as an ox. While I do say keeping an open mind is crucial it is important to question the narrative given by mainstream media none of this is adding up.

","I waited for this documentary for a long time. Was not disappointed. If you think the government and elites have a depopulation plan, then it's clearly well on it's way to fruition. Scary times. And with the Twitter files coming out. It's mind-blowing the deception and deceit of our government and medical fields. The embalmer know what they are talking about and they see first hand the unknown clotting. Some even scared to go on camera. Like a horror movie in real life.

6 December 2022,MakeYourOwnMind,10," Tyrants and their cronies will try HARD to bring it down!
","Many have already DIED SUDDENLY without a good reason that is with no previous health history to indicate such a tragedy. As more and more evidence is uncovered and brought into the spotlight the powers that be, the ones responsible and the ones who bought into the fear campaign will try their best to bring down the publication of all that destroys the mainstream narrative that is being drilled down into our consciousness. The collusion between the Big Pharma, Big Tech, and Big Brother is so obvious these days that one must be either too naive or too brain-damaged to deny it. The fake science behind the plandemics and the lockdown mandates of the ruling elites and their henchmen like Fauci etc have been exposed. They know it and it's a race which they are loosing! One can easily see the censorship when they search for anything that contradicts the mainstream propaganda: top results are all ""fact-checked"" and ""debunked"" and the like with 1 out of 10 thumb downs and negative reviews posted as a ""featured review"". This design works for the lazy, low attention, low IQ, scan the headlines-deep bozos which by Pareto Principle are 8 out 10, the followers of what is currently chic & pop, the ones who'd call you crazy tin-foil hat wearer, you know - all the usual name-calling to dissuade you from getting red-pilled and unplugged from the Collective. If you fancy yourself as someone capable of critical thinking and able to make your own mind, then you are already paying attention. This documentary is by no means the end of an investigation into what's been happening for the last two or so years. It is only a start! A film that will shed some light onto this new phenomenon quickly labeled with a new slick-sounding and ""sciency"" medical term of SADS. The rabbit hole goes much deeper than what is covered within an hour of this very important film. Those wanting to know more can find a ton of information out on Rumble, Telegram channels, etc. This documentary is a MUST-WATCH!!",/review/rw8720068/?ref_=tt_urv
