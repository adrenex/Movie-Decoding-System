10 July 2003,gridoon,6," Vulgar but spirited and energetic comedy.
","By some lucky (?) chance, I watched this movie a few days after watching ""Flesh Gordon 2"", so I was able to easily tell the difference between a likable moronic and tasteless sex comedy and a painful moronic and tasteless sex comedy. Granted, ""Tomcats"" has more energy than laughs, and the story is predictable in the extreme; however, it works by mixing in some sweetness along with the vulgarity, and it certainly helps that Jerry O'Connell and Shannon Elizabeth have a nice chemistry together - you get the feeling they would make a likable pair. Now, if only they had given a larger role to Jaime Pressly....(**1/2)",/review/rw0733747/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2003,Enchorde,7," Funny, juvenile but funny...
","** Here might be spoilers ** This movie is kind of a enigma to me. No, be serious, I got the plot, the whole predictable plot. At a wedding the remaining bachelors makes a bet that whoever is the last bachelor will win a bundle of money. One after one they marry and finally there are only two left, Michael, the cartoonist and Kyle, the playboy. Suddenly life gets complicated for Michael as he loses lots of money in a Las Vegas casino, and only one month to pay. He sees only one solution, he must win that bet.",/review/rw0733747/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2007,acustomer,9," Look at the Reviewers- You'll note a trend
","Firstly, I may well be slightly biased- because I really truly enjoyed this movie. However, seeing it with a score under 5- and then looking at the reviews, there is a notable trend. The good reviews are predominantly well punctuated and articulate, with such things as (gasp) accurate spelling and grammar. Conversely, most of the bad reviews tend to be short blurbs with not a capital letter to be found.",/review/rw0733747/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2001,mattymatt4ever,7," A very funny movie!
","Is ""Tomcats"" as tasteless as you think?  Definitely!  This is not a smart, intellectual comedy.  The gags are often pretty cheap.  But I laughed a lot! I wouldn't put this movie down in comedy history, but if you want to spend a whole hour and thirty minutes croaking with laughter--I can't say you'll be disappointed.  If you can't handle this lewd brand of comedy, please don't bother with ""Tomcats.""  However, there is one joke involving the consumption of a human testicle (Yes, you heard right) which I felt was one of the MOST disgusting gags I've ever seen!!!  Better yet, one of the most disgusting moments in the history of motion pictures.  I have to say, I almost gave up on the film at that point.  Luckily, the copious laughs made up for the extreme crudeness.  So if you decide to rent this movie, make sure you fast-forward to the next scene when the testicle scene comes up. As long as you skip through that one scene, you should be able to leave this movie unharmed.  The plot is sitcom material, and no more than a bunch of setups for hysterical, outrageous gags, but I was laughing so hard I ignored the throwaway plot.  ",/review/rw0733747/?ref_=tt_urv

8 April 2001,LoveSnail,10," Finally...
","Finally there is a movie where the previews don't show the funniest parts of the movie.  Take it from me-the previews are less than half as funny as the movie is!  But, if you're not into sick and perverted humor, then you probably won't enjoy most portions of this movie.  However, if you do, I recommend it highly.",/review/rw0733747/?ref_=tt_urv

15 September 2019,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,10," Underrated, unappreciated the best comedy of 2000's one of my favorites
","To hell with haters of this movie. It is one of my favorite movies of early 2000's staring Jerry O'Connell, Shannon Elizabeth, and Jake Busey. Yes Shannon Elizabeth from American Pie 1, 2 and American Reunion is in this movie. Since I reviewd all ""American Pie"" movies. it is time to a review another decent comedy from 2000's. Tomcats is a sexy hilarious funy comedy I love this movie to death.",/review/rw0733747/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2002,riikamagnus,10," The funniest movie ever!
","I thought that this movie was hilarious! Jerry O'Connell did a really great job, and the music is awesome. It was an original movie, that had a great plot. I think that everyone, that has a sense of humor, should see this movie.",/review/rw0733747/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2001,CigarsAndPars,10," Laugh fest
","If you are a politically correct nerd or a raging feminist, don't bother watching this movie. This is not for you. Go watch ""Some like it hot"" or something like that. It is obvious that no critic would write anything positive about this movie even if he peed in his pants laughing. They would just get hurt in today's politically correct climate and they know it.  I realize that a lot of people here have never attended a decent party and had zero to one partners in their life, but that doesn't mean that others shouldn't have a good time watching comedies like this. My wife and I had a great time watching this movie. 10/10.",/review/rw0733747/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,1," Just far too mean-spirited and disgusting to be funny
","I had expected a fairly straightforward R-rated graphic, sexual, crude teen-comedy when I sat down to see this... it turned out to be fairly accurate... only it was far more sick and disgusting than I would have thought. I don't know if the director/writer Gregory Poirier is sick or deeply messed up sexually, but I doubt that a normal person could have made a movie like this. I could probably have taken it if it was just that, if the only thing that was wrong was it was that it required a tough stomach... but it isn't. The film is also horribly mean-spirited and disturbing... every single character that has more than one full second of time on-screen is an extreme... sexually, mentally or physically. I don't know if this is just the director's sense of humor, but I just found it to be... wrong. Just wrong. Even in a comedy, there is supposed to be some seriousness. The plot is stupid. The acting is bad. The characters are inconsistent and poorly written... all of them. There isn't one single likable character in the film. The humor is disgusting and goes way too far. The film is just so incredibly poorly done that I really don't think it's worth anyone's time. If you like R-rated, crude comedies with plenty of sexual innuendo and graphic stuff, watch The Groomsmen, or, better yet, American Pie... or Road Trip, my personal favorite. But don't watch this. I can't possibly describe to you how bad it is... you would have to experience it for yourself. However, this is one of those times where I'll say that you're better off wondering. That way you can just imagine that this film goes very close to the bottom... without knowing that it goes through it, and far lower than that. This movie most of all looks like a group of horny teenage guys got together, put together a film crew, and every-time one of them got an idea, they filmed it, and later put the entire thing together. It lacks structure, consistency and taste. I recommend this only to horny teenage guys who have seen every single other R-rated crude teen comedy and who don't care about quality. Everyone else... do the sensible thing; avoid this. It's not even worth it to see the booty. Believe me. 1/10",/review/rw0733747/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2001,m67165,," It made me laugh
","I know ""There's something about Mary"" was much better as gross fun. But this one made me smile a lot, and actually laugh out loud two or three times. Not that tears were running from my eyes, but I was shaking with laughter at least once, so it was worth the while, all right. And, yes, now I guess I know what a nut looks like.",/review/rw0733747/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2001,preppy-3,1," Tasteless, unfunny, misogynic comedy
","A bunch of 20 something male cretins gather together to celebrate another's wedding. The unmarried ones vow never to get married and every year, pledge to put a few hundred (the movie is VERY vague on details) in an account and the last one still unmarried wins it all. Seven years later, all but two (Jerry O'Connell and Jake Busey) are married. O'Connell needs the money to save his life (don't ask) and convinces a woman (Shannon Elizabeth) to seduce Busey and get him to marry. Naturally, he falls for her. Not the worst comedy on 2001 (that still goes to ""Saving Silverman"") but REAL close. It's stupid and beyond disgusting (a section about a testicle almost made me walk out). None of the jokes were funny--they include sure-fire knee slappers involving degrading women, gays, degrading women, child molestation, degrading women, cancer...did I say they have jokes degrading women? I did laugh a few times because the film was so desperate. The plot is ridiculous and woman are shown as sex objects constantly. The funny thing is, there's no nudity but plenty of shots of young, beautiful women in next to nothing. You know--if I want that, I'll buy Playboy thank you! Another thing is Jake Busey is cast as a stud--he's ugly and VERY obnoxious but all the woman are all over him! O'Connell tries (too hard) to play a nice guy--unfortunately, he's no comedian. Only Elizabeth comes through looking good. A totally worthless piece of film--if you want a good gross-out comedy, rent ""American Pie"". AVOID THIS ONE!!!!!",/review/rw0733747/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2008,RainDogJr,," $500,000 or a wife?
","The other night my cousins and I were watching some TV after midnight and we catch up the last 20 minutes of ""Big Fish"" and after that film ""Tomcats"" began. It was very late but the credits sequence was cool so we stay and the first beat in the film was really funny so we end up watching it until the end. That beat was between 4 or 5 friends and consist in never get married; they created a bank account so every day that passes, more money for the winner. Eventually everybody get married, except Michael and Kyle, and now the prize for the winner is $500,000. The story suddenly makes that Michael needs the money by the end of the week so he makes a plan and blah blah. After that we just forget about the beat and is all a love story, quite predictable by the way, and even the main character ends in a point when even he won the money, he doesn't care because of the love. But in that entire decent love story there are many funny moments especially for the sexual maniac that is Kyle and for Michael's bad experiences with women, even if they look like a pretty innocent girl or if they are the grandma of the innocent girl Eventually we have a really enjoyable time with this film without expecting something. So I think this film is the kind that if you have the chance to watch it just for coincidence in TV it will be a good way to have 90 minutes of pure entertainment.",/review/rw0733747/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2006,vchimpanzee,," Funny but crude, Shannon Elizabeth great
","Max, at age 19, is the first member of the Tomcats to get married. The guys put money in a fund which will go to the last single member of the group. Seven years later, Steve is married to Trisha in Vegas by a man who can be described as a cross between Elvis and Apu from 'The Simpsons'. Only Mike and Kyle are still single, and the fund has nearly a half million dollars.",/review/rw0733747/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2001,DunnDeeDaGreat,7," Critics are wrong
","Just seeing this film tonight, I have to say that I was very pleased with it. It made me laugh and happy to be with someone. The cast is great including Jerry O'Connel, Jake Busey, Shannon Elizabeth and Jamie Presely. The plot of this movie revoles around friends who make a bet when there young. The bet is the last man married gets a pot of money. It's now 2001 and Jerry O'Connel and Jake busey are the only ones who aren't married. O'Connel gets in trouble in Veags and has to pay a debt so he teams up with Shannon Elizabeth to marry off Kyle played by Jake Busey. The film is very funny but has one major flaw it lacks nudity. Go see it and have fun.",/review/rw0733747/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2008,headly66,1," Trash pile
","Not even worth a free view on cable, this is the dumbest most infantile thing ever, was this directed and written by twelve year olds? Slapstick is funny, dumb is funny, but it actually has to be funny to be funny! The premise is the guy needs 50K to pay off the casino, but casinos don't give credit to nobodies. Then he can't figure out where to get the money but he is driving around in a 71' Plymouth Hemi Cuda worth way over 50K. The acting is cardboard, the direction mindless and the story so ridiculously dumb you can't even enjoy this as a time waster or a good silly movie like Dodgeball or Anchorman. God help us all from this drivel, I'd rather slam my head into a wall for an hour and a half.",/review/rw0733747/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2001,Quinoa1984,3," Some laughs, but not enough
","I know this may sound strange from someone who holds Dumb and Dumber, Billy Madison, South Park and American Pie in such high regards, but this movie just didn't do it for me.  A couple of laughs here and there (the last joke was fair), but the characters and script were the thing that didn't do it right.  For instance, there is a gag where a guy has to get back his friend's ball that was put in a jar.  Soon, the ball is bouncing around like the one you buy for a quarter in a store, until a guy eats it with relish. Might've been funny years ago, but now, it's actually too sick.

13 November 2001,CanadianDiehard,7," Once Again the Critics were wrong
","Now Tomcats wasn't THAT BAD. I remember all these critics were saying this movie was so bad. Yadda Yadda. These are the same people who said that Black Sheep was a bad movie. Tomcats had it's moments that you will never forget. Sure Jerry O'Connell was better in Joe's Apartment, and maybe Hoartio Sans isn't the best actor in the world, all together it makes up a pretty good movie. I recommend it, if you like slapstick comedy",/review/rw0733747/?ref_=tt_urv
