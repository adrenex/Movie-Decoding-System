2 August 2017,davispittman,8," Actually turned out to be deeper than gross out humor
","I will say this for American Pie, it's not full out of completely gross out humor like Van Wilder (2002). It's got a couple of scenes based on crude humor, but I was glad to see that for the most part, the movie steered clear of over the top disgusting humor. The characters are good hearted boys that think they just want sex, and for a couple of the characters that turns out to be true, but for a couple other of them, it turns out that just ""getting laid"" isn't the most important thing. I liked that the characters actually ended up to have a deeper want and that they actually end up having better connections with girls that yes may involve sex, but that's not all that it's based upon. Now this movie isn't all love and good hearted stuff, it's got plenty and I do mean plenty of raunchy/dirty humor. Humor that involves male and female masturbation in different ways, premature ejaculation, and very descriptive talk of all kinds of sexual activities. Just FYI in case any of that offends you. There is some truly funny material in the film, I laughed at several scenes in the movie. I didn't think it was laugh out loud hilarious, but some parts were funny. The parts I wasn't laughing at, I was feeling for the characters. I loved the acting from all the cast members. Tara Reid was really good as Vicky. Jason Biggs was a perfect choice for Jim. Thomas Nicholas is great as Kevin. Chris Klein is very good as Oz. And the rest of the cast is good too, but Kevin, Vicky, Oz, and Jim are the biggest characters here. I loved how Oz and Kevin were so adorable and were actually good hearted guys. I really like American Pie because not only is it funny but it's also good hearted and filled with good characters. 8/10.",/review/rw1509319/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 1999,Starks,8," Classic!!!
","I have to say that the most fun I had at the movies this summer was when I saw American Pie, the funniest picture I've seen since last summer's There's Something About Mary. This movie has taken the classic teenage boy film (Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds) and spruced it up for the 90's.  It is hilarious from start to finish. If you like physical comedy, gross out comedy, sexual comedy, American Pie has it all.  A great ensemble cast of likeable young actors makes this a joy to watch.     ",/review/rw1509319/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 1999,Jaime N. Christley,7," Astoundingly good-natured sex comedy
","The director and the writer, Paul Weitz and Adam Herz respectively, will do anything for a laugh -- that's good, as it turns out, because this movie has a great many laughs in it.  There's not much of that restricting, suffocating ""logic"" stuff around, but ""American Pie"" is immensely enjoyable. I mean, almost none of the things that happen in this film would ever, ever come to pass in real life, but it doesn't matter.",/review/rw1509319/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2019,RhapsodyReviews,8," Funny Teen Sex Comedy.
","Review:
'American Pie' is a comedy film directed by Paul and Chris Weitz. It is the first film in the 'American Pie' series.
I was surprised to see the amount of negative reaction to this movie. I remember the first time I saw it and laughed almost the whole way through. The only problem that I had was that I couldn't accept the cast as being an average age of around 17.
The performances were really great for a comedy of the 1990's. Jason Biggs stands out amongst all of them, with his dorky and desperate persona. He blends funny dialog with very funny physical comedy. Also, Alyson Hannigan who has a small but funny role is also great and she says the best line in the movie. Let's talk about Eugene Levi for a second, holy cow what a funny man this guy is. He is so natural as the over sharing father who just makes everybody either uncomfortable or laughing out loud.
What can I say about this movie besides that It's a comedic classic! American Pie perfectly blends a buddy comedy, extreme gross-out humor, and dare I say a coming of age movie. It's one of those movies that is easy to predict when something bad will happen, but that's what made me laugh so hard. Some of the comedic moments are very offensive and this movie could not be made today.
Overall, this movie is a crazy, outrageous, amazingly funny comedy. I recommend it to anybody who isn't easily offended and has a great sense of humor!

26 September 1999,Chris-564,," My cup of tea. Not everybody's - but certainly mine.
","I had the good fortune to see a sneak preview of this film in England, a couple of weeks before release - and I was very impressed indeed.  Hurrah - a comedy that is laugh-out-loud funny, enough to make you cringe at the embarrassing bits (of which there are many), and smile at the sentiment, which isn't corny in the slightest.  This coming-of-age tale of four boys who make a pact to become men by losing their virginity by prom night is the perfect movie to go the cinema with your buddies to see, but probably not with your family.  Having said that, I saw a family (son, mother, father and grandmother) coming out of the cinema, and they had a great time.  The grandmother couldn't stop laughing, and saying how true it all was.  Which is interesting, if a little embarrassing.",/review/rw1509319/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2012,lesleyharris30,8," Total teenage movie,but still very funny and better than average,
","American Pie is a fairly good movie,with good humor and a funny storyline,its a total teenage movie but its better than average ones.The story lines sort of stupid and the characters are extremely immature for there age,but thats what makes it so funny and definitely better than the sequels.",/review/rw1509319/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 1999,cLoNe,9," Hilarious! BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

11 October 2015,bowmanblue,8," There was this one time – at band camp – when we watched a really funny film
","Okay, so I know that 'teens behaving badly' is hardly a revolutionary genre when it comes to film-making. However, sometimes a film comes along that, while not really offering much that's new, sort of revitalises the genre (and naturally spawns one hundred and one poorer imitations). 'American Pie' did just this. Four horny teenage boys vow to lose their virginity before they graduate from high school and, as the old saying goes 'with hilarious consequences.' But, unlike all those times where that worn and weary phrase never really quite lives up to its boast, this time it does.",/review/rw1509319/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2013,dustinkdye,6," 'American Pie' set the bar for teen sex comedies
","""So high school boys everywhere only think about sex, huh?"" my Japanese wife turned to me and said about 20 minutes into ""American Pie."" She looked at me expectantly, as if she wanted to hear me say I was somehow different, above such base pursuits. I could tell she was mildly disappointed when I replied, ""Yeah, pretty much."" Eighteen-year-old boys' raging hormones is a truly universal theme.",/review/rw1509319/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 1999,T-10,," a well seasoned confection
","American Pie has all the ingredients of a good movie.  First, the plot deals with young people in search of their first sexual experience.  What could be more basic to the human condition?  Second, although obviously fiction, the film has a feeling of reality capturing the awkwardness and anxiety of young people at this point in their lives.  Third, it is well written and not always predictable as each young man employs his own strategy, and of course, in the real world things do not always go as planned.  Fourth, the cast consists of very talented young actors playing characters which may remind the audience of people they may have known.  Fifth, the film has its poignant moments. The final ingredient is this movie is hilarious.  The film has one liners, sight gags, and situations that very funny.  The audience, which ranged from teenagers to middle age, laughed almost constantly and out loud.  CAUTION: This film is rated ""R"" for sexual situations and the use of alcohol by young people.  If you are easily offended or sexual humor makes you uncomfortable, stay away.  However, if you are not in the aforementioned, you may enjoy it.  Three stars!!!",/review/rw1509319/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2000,Buddy-51,," crude but amusing sex comedy
","If you are a person easily offended by a film dedicated primarily to the glory of teen sex, you may well view ""American Pie"" as yet another in a long line of cinematic harbingers of the collapse of western civilization.  If, however, you remember adolescence as essentially a period of unending coitus interruptus, you may well find yourself engrossed by this amusing, though admittedly crude, series of sexual and scatalogical gags woven around a plot involving the desperate attempts of a quartet of last semester seniors to lose their virginity on the fast approaching sexual armageddon known as ""prom night.""",/review/rw1509319/?ref_=tt_urv

11 April 2020,pcampionz,9," Porkys for the 90s
","Back when I was in high school porkys came out. It was at the time, way ahead of its time, and really stretched the limits of an R rating. American Pie far surpassed the Porkys franchise. So glad I was able to see American Pie at the theatre. If you haven't seen this, this should be on your list of comedies to see before you die!",/review/rw1509319/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2021,darkwizard404,10," Still funny after all these years...
",I was in my final year of high school when a friend recommended me this movie. I don't remember the last time I laughed so hard during a movie. The comedy was on point and the characters were very well written.,/review/rw1509319/?ref_=tt_urv

",I don't often leave reviews but I had to comment how this film is clearly lost on some people. I was 18 when this film came out. Obviously those leaving bad reviews are a lot younger and don't realise the contemporary movie landscape.,/review/rw1509319/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2007,StanMakitadonuts,10," Flutes and pies
","Where do you start... from flutes to pies, this pioneer teen movie has it all. I'm pretty sure this was the first DVD I ever saw, back in 2000. I do remember owing $20 in late fees to blockbuster video for keeping it so long after it was due back. It was worth it! This has classic written all over it, I think it's safe to say that anyone that was involved with this movie has a great career now because of it. American pie has an absolute all star cast led by the Great Jason biggs Anyone who enjoys comedy, teen comedy must see this movie! honestly you need to watch more movies if you haven't sen this one!!!",/review/rw1509319/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2021,m-47826,8," This prissy generation can keep their « classics ».
","This is the kind of movie I grew up with. I was a bit younger than the protagonists, and rewatching it now makes me feel really nostalgic. The humor was spontaneous, it didn't care about offending a loaf of bread. It was just comedy for the sake of having people laugh. And indulge in below the waist humor. But the difference with this one is, it has heartfelt undertones, which is why it didn't get a bad rep, or people diminishing its otherwise qualities. The cast is the most iconic of the franchise, and none of the bad acting bothered me. And it still don't. I also love the music, obviously, and still regret so many good songs were missing from the official soundtrack. Or no volume 2 was ever released. I have no doubt a movie like this would shock a lot of « us » today. When will this regression stop? But it is too good for them anyway. As for the rest, enjoy and just be entertained. And see how cool 90s kids were.",/review/rw1509319/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2005,mjw2305,9," Refreshingly Funny
","Since the likes of 'Animal house' and 'Porky's' i've waiting for another movie that confronts the funny side of of teenage life, in particular the sexual dilemmas we all have to face at some point in our teens. (I hope not to many people deal with them quite like this though) American Pie delivers exactly this and plenty more. With some truly hilarious characters and some terrific dialogue, this film will have you in stitches, and contains scenes that will be laughed about for years.",/review/rw1509319/?ref_=tt_urv

","American Pie is my favorite comedy of all time, and I have no shame in saying it. It's dumb, it's hilarious but it also has something that most of the films in the franchise lacks: Heart. The characters are great and even though it's very comedic in execution, it's really a film about becoming an adult.",/review/rw1509319/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2006,Flagrant-Baronessa,8," Men need sex to feel loved. Women need love to have sex. Where do you even begin?
","American Pie was a gruesome experience for me because the first time I watched it was with my best friend's older brother and father. Yeah, just us three. I was thirteen years old and a little part of me died as the brazen jokes kept piling up and culminating in grossness, upon which the father shifted awkwardly in his seat. With hindsight it was absolutely worth every minute of agony, because the film is such a powerful staple on the raunchy teen comedy wall of fame today and surely one of the most laugh-out-loud worthy films in my DVD collection (which isn't saying much since I have a total of like 20 films but still).",/review/rw1509319/?ref_=tt_urv
