","This is an outrageously over the top take on a mostly true story. Some people have been moaning that the soundtrack, mainly rock and punk are wrong for this show, as is the bad language but I think it gives it a real punch, and I'm in no doubt that bad language would have been rife in this unit of men.",/review/rw8657510/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,AzSumTuk,8," The negative reviews are surprising
","OK, I'm not going to claim that this show is a masterpiece or anything. It's just good fun. That's all there is to it - it is an action adventure show set in the past, not that different from the books that made Bernard Cornwell so popular - yeah, it is somewhat historical, it actually does do history some justice, but, first and foremost, it is here to entertain and does it masterfully. It has nice production values, great pacing, well developed characters, impressive action scenes and enough drama to keep a viewer's attention.",/review/rw8657510/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2022,peterrichboy,9," Quality action packed WW2 drama from the BBC
","Having read the book this series is based on and having read the incredible bravery of men such as Paddy Maine. I thought Steven Knight and the BBC have done an amazing job of bringing these characters who I had only previously read about bought to life. These men may have been part of the British Army but in reality they were mercenaries, who conducted there own war by there own rules. This really is a high quality production with authentic weapons uniforms all forms of transport. And the raid scenes on the various airfields are as good as anything Netflix or even Hollywood could come up with especially the raid in episode 6 which is truly spectacular.",/review/rw8657510/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2022,StuDeb2,10," Fantastic
","I absolutely loved this. It was so well done. I thought it was a brilliant cast, some amazing acting and great music. It was a joy to watch this. What those men went through to help save this country. Such bravery. Would we have as many men and women willing to sacrifice themselves for this country today. ? I hope so. It was amazing to see how the SAS was formed. It was also good to see real black and white photos of the real SAS. I wish there were more shows like this. I'm glad it has a high rating as it deserves it.",/review/rw8657510/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,W011y4m5,8," Bold, boisterous & brave.
","Having watched all 6 episodes of this new series, I can confidently say each chapter continues to build upon the established foundations of its previous installment with a genuine energy & enthusiasm I can't help but appreciate; creator & executive producer Steven Knight partners with the brilliant director Tom Shankland & together, the two of them have taken a risk & approached this adaptation in refreshingly self aware way with their artistic representations of historical events which seem (for the most part) utterly absurd, so neither try & depict them as anything other than that.",/review/rw8657510/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2022,roxmewild,10," Superbly written produced and acted
",Steven Knight is one of my favourite writers and this offering falls right in with some of his best Peaky Blinders and Taboo being 2 that spring to mind. He has crafted this story based on true events and sensitive scripted story making. Like most excellent stories it does not take the viewer long to not only get to know the characters of these men but to form a kind of bond with each different one It is both knowledgeable and exciting to watch .On a personal level I hate War and all it stands for but I have the utmost respect and gratitude for every person whom put their lives at risk and lost their life's to save us from Facism and Hitler ! A truly must watch series!,/review/rw8657510/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,GB65,8," Loving It
","Firstly, let's get the 'millstone' of the contemporary music out of the way. At first it surprised and disappointed me but I have to say as the series progressed, it grew on me immensely and I believe added to the programme. And yes, of course, there's elements of poetic licence involved but again, I didn't feel it detracted from anything. Overall, I think most of the historical facts are adhered to and I love the acting and storylines. Ben McIntyre -an outstanding journalist and author- who wrote the book upon which this is based, was also involved in the series and as I haven't read any dissent from him, I'm guessing he's relatively happy with it. Bottom line, I found it entertaining. Thumbs up from me.",/review/rw8657510/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2022,MacReadysBeard,9," sas meets the peaky blinders
","This is about the origins of the SAS is it all 100% is it hell. Heres the thing a whole bunch of the negative reviews bumble on about this slating the good names of the men involved. Two observations on that front , 1 do you honestly think the Stirling family amongst others would allow there relative amongst the others to be made an ass of ? Not a chance. 2 is this show a drama - Yes - are dramas which tell you at the outset ""mostly true"" 100% true - Nope. 3 - we have remeberance sunday to remember the fallen shows like this help keep the memory of those hard battles alive. 4 is war polite and pretty and clean - get a grip. 5 - battles like that are fought in dirt and blood and sacrafice - soliders back then as now werent all David niven caricatures all toodle pipping and jolly old chapping and off to the mess for a tipple at the end of the day, Yes steven knight has added a peaky blinders razor edge to the dialogue and the pace of the story but they make for good adventures where the cards are all on the table britian was on the brink and some clever , hard battle savvy men managed to stop the nazi war machine from winning. All in all suspend disbelief , suspend getting your knickers in a twist and enjoy it for what it is - a cracking show worth a watch with some great performances from seasoned and up and coming actors.",/review/rw8657510/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2022,brainwerx-1,8," Love it
",This is a great series to watch and brings to light how the SAS became what it is today. In a period where no one was 'watching' a group of (mostly) men decided that something extreme had to be done. Something that was just this side of insane. And they did it.,/review/rw8657510/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,ollieblake-18462,9," Punchy bit of history..
","Move over Peaky Blinders.... not quite, the two are chalk and cheese. However, Steven Knight has done wonders again. As close to the truth this generation will get to the legendary acts of defiance from the SAS, during such an iconic bit of history. Punchy, dramatic, moden, aggressive and a serious eye opener of true bravery.",/review/rw8657510/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2022,rchalloner,9," You don't have to be mad, but it helps....
","A tremendous ripping yarn. There have always been eccentrics and madmen in the British Armed Forces. Which is partly why they have been so successful. Stirling and his crew exemplified the insane courage that finally brought victory in North Africa against the odds and turned the tide of WWII. In the bleak, hostile and barren beauty of the desert a certain level of insanity must have been required. My father fought in North Africa in the Recce Corps, motto ""Only the Enemy In Front...Every Other Bugger Behind"" and generally they knew they had found the enemy when they started being shelled. Madness, courage or rank stupidity, they carried on and suffered huge casualties, just like Stirling and his crew. This is a hugely entertaining series, but it also reminds us how lucky we are that there were individuals like Stirling, Mayne and the others, mad enough to attempt the seemingly impossible and incredibly, succeed in helping to change the outcome of the war. People should just enjoy it and give thanks that because of this bunch of desperadoes the most brilliant and feared regiment in the world was born and still protects our country.",/review/rw8657510/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2022,DAXXX_carrand,10," Absolutely glued to the screen
","As the first episode passed on the screen it struck me that this is definitely one of my top 3 favor series of 2022. As my dear dad , may he rest in peace, was a member of the LRDG and following that the SAS and he fought in the rogue heroes regiment for part of WWII it just hit me. Unluckily it was a mini series and dreaded seeing the last episode knowing it might not return. Luckily I found out tonight...although season two is yet to be officially confirmed by the BBC, it is believed there could be at least three more seasons. And I hope it will. The combination of action (not always as it happened with the real desert rats), the modern edgy music and scenery makes it truly enjoyable.",/review/rw8657510/?ref_=tt_urv

3 November 2022,geister_faust,8," Entertaining take on the history
","Although not pretending to be historically accurate on the documentary level, this show succeeds in the entertainment department. Smartly paced and nicely packed as a limited series of 6 episodes it develops a story exactly as good mini series should: conclusive, without cliffhangers.",/review/rw8657510/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2022,stephensaulters-68333,9," Not a WW2 documentary - Just a ruddy good show!
","Let's get one things straight, anyone with a decent level of WW2 knowledge will pick up on mistakes. Uniforms, weapons,kit,tanks,trucks and even the traits and likeness of the main characters. The BBC don't see to care much for accuracy anymore with their shows. However watch this as Band of Brothers meets Peaky Blinders and you're onto a winner. The characters are all played brilliantly if historically inaccurately. The way they interact with eachother is also very entertaining and has you rooting for this tag tag group from the off. The music in the backround has you tapping your toes as the SAS drive across the dessert on their way to pick a fight with the Axis forces. The gun fights while over the top are a good watch. Switch off and enjoy it for what it is. It's not a master piece like Band of brothers but let's face it what is...",/review/rw8657510/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2022,gjbardsley,9," Peaky Blinders meets Band of Brothers
","This action packed WW2 comedy drama is the product of Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight. The look, style and tone of SAS Rogue Hero's match that of its Crime drama sister show. The three Principal lead actors of; Connor Swindles as the charismatic alcoholic toff David Stirling, Alfie Allen as the stern straight-man Welshman Jock Lewes, and lastly Jack O'Connor as the loud brash mad Irish Paddy Mayne. The trio of the Swashbuckler, Strategist, and straight jacket Maddog but heads as they form the first SAS regiment in Libya behind Axis lines. Each actor plays their respective role brilliantly, however O'Connor brings forth a performance like none he has done before. When you think of actors who are type casted as soldier or military men, O'Connor is definitely apart of that list. Especially with his performances in 71, The man with the iron heart, and Unbroken. But as Paddy Mayne, we see a different sort of soldier. Though his take on the legendary Northern Irishman soldier is fictionalised, it is no less stellar and complex. Suffice to say I felt like I was watching Tom Hardy. Whilst I doubt O'Connor was channeling Hardy, i was reminded of Hardy's performances as Alfie Solomons in Peaky blinders and Ron Kray in Legend.",/review/rw8657510/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2022,favafruit,10," I can't believe it's over - waiting for Series 2
","When you look at some old war movies, some people say, ""They don't make them like that anymore,"" but they do, they did--well, not a movie but a six part series. We had just finished watch the Woodstock documentary, and felt like this was a continuation. The music makes it. It makes you feel like you are one of the guys in the 1940's. The music conscripts you in with these crazy soldiers who would have not be out of place in Woodstock. Yet, somehow, the characters blend an English prig, an Irish fighter, a Jewish Frenchman, and a German who's on ""our side."" It's a series where men get to be men, and you get to see what happens when they do.",/review/rw8657510/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2022,diannestackpool,10," Excellent depiction of the absurdity of war.
","It is historically true that many decisions made by the generals in charge of battles throughout history made absurd decisions. This show depicts the frustration felt by those in the line of fire. For Australians, Gallipoli is a prime example. As the books describe, this is the beginning of what are to become special forces. Men who could see what was needed and decided to do it even though it wasn't approved of by their superiors. I liken this to Catch 22, another depiction of the absurdity of war. This is an engaging, fast paced series that builds with every episode and doesn't hesitate not to toe the party line in its depiction of war. It just gets better!!",/review/rw8657510/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2022,paudman,9," I wasn't prepared to like it
","But i do. For some strange reason the style does click with me, and it's not often that does happen, especially with any BBC production. They usually insert all kinds of anachronistic wokery, but here they've restrained themselves merely to a few unlikely roles for background actors. It's an adventure story, yes they're going to be larger than life, and it's sort of based on a true story - although why they introduced a fictional French-Albanian spy into the mix is beyond me. The music actually helps - it brings the story to an almost modern setting, and certainly suits the action more than Vera Lynn would. I do have a few niggles though - accents... hmmm. Was that a Jamaican pilot? Paddy Mayne sounds more like West Belfast and Dublin mix than Newtownards, it's almost embarrassing - didn't they research that? He's a paddy, not a sammy. They really do need subtitles, currently unavailable. And please - would someone start a GoFundMe page to buy Alfie Allen a different facial expression? He's got the 'I am Theon Greyjoy and I'm trying to make up for things' expression permanently fixed on his face. Otherwise I do like it, I'll give it a chance to see how things go (currently on episode 3) and if nothing else it'll pass a few hours.",/review/rw8657510/?ref_=tt_urv
