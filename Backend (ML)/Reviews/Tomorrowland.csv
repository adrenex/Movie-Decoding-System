25 September 2015,jackmeat,6," Fun kid safe sci fi movie that looks great
","My quick rating - 6,0/10. Unfairly dogged in the theater but it does have its flaws. The story itself is contrived and really doesn't try to explain itself to well. Then again, it is fantasy ad summer blockbuster so why am I bothering being critical. The movie looks fabulous as expected (200 million in budget will do that) so at least the movie broke even (not even close with marketing). Britt Robinson(female lead) does a very good job in her acting role and is very believable as the apprehensive young kid. Nice to see some good wholesome kid sci fi that still entertains adults, this is why I think it didn't get a fair shake. Parents should've been rushing their kids to a little more mature sci fi film but I guess the marketing just didn't hit the right audience. To be honest, by the marketing, I personally saw it as another George Clooney vehicle which it wasn't. Oh well,still an enjoyable film that stands up even with its flaws.",/review/rw3247649/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2015,ThomasDrufke,5," The Future Has Arrived
","Sci-Fi is a genre of two opinions and two opinions only. You pretty much either love a Sci-Fi film or you hate on it repeatedly. It's very rare to fall in the middle of the two, it's just that polarizing of a genre. But it just so happens that I feel as though Tomorrowland is a film that does fall in the middle. On the one hand, it's a visually stunning film that doesn't rely on mind-blowing effects or spectacle. But on the other hand, there just wasn't a great story to back up the visuals. The message the film gives us is clear and I'm sure it will be inspiring to a lot of people, but the reality is a film isn't good because of what it tells us to feel, it's whether or not it gets us to feel that way.",/review/rw3247649/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2015,sheldonchorta,7," Why do people hate this movie?
","Don't listen to the haters giving this movie ones and twos, because this movie is phenomenal! This was my favorite Disney movie before Inside Out came out (then it became my number two favorite). The characters are nice and fun with just enough screen time and character development to make them likable. The story: Brad Bird's GREATEST PREMISE since a Superhero family! The world is going to end because someone has implanted that idea into everyone's heads. So it is up to a girl with a great imagination and determination to save it. But the twist is the bad guy in this movie isn't George Clooney for making the device, or the Audio-Animatronic girl, or even Hugh Laurie. It's US. Because we didn't know any better, we didn't try to fight the idea of the end of the world. So, in a way, WE are the reason that this movie exists. I guess the only reason people hate on this movie is because of the continuity errors and the fact that they are the bad guys. Speaking of, this movie does have it's faults, but who cares when you have a great story and characters AND amazing special effects. And, yeah, the effects in this movie are beyond amazing. When I saw Tomorrowland for the first time, and the rocket in the Eiffel Tower, I was blown away! I saw the trailers and the effects made me gravitate towards this movie! And the trailer is probably another reason why people don't like this movie. The trailer made it look like an early preview for Star Wars 7. I was also expecting that, but when I saw the actual movie, the trailer didn't matter. So what if you didn't get a dumb action sci-Fi flick. You have a new original idea acted well, directed well, written well, and made at the right time that this movie should have been a hit! Tomorrowland: Disney's dream on the big screen, and I LOVE IT.",/review/rw3247649/?ref_=tt_urv

27 May 2015,tavm,7," I liked Disney's Tomorrowland enough for what it is...
","Okay, after reading many of the reviews of this movie on this site-many of them on the negative side-here's mine: It was mostly quite thrilling and touching and a little thoughtful and occasionally humorous and it was awesome seeing it on an IMAX screen! Perhaps it was a little long for a family film but, still, I think many kids would be a little enthralled in this with the way director Brad Bird movies things along most of the time. George Clooney and Hugh Laurie perform well in their roles and that girl robot and teen girl also were pretty good, character-wise. I suppose I have to admit that the story took awhile to get together but when it ended, I sorta thought it made enough sense by that point. But I don't blame anyone who wasn't too thrilled by this movie not getting it. So on that note, Tomorrowland is at the least, worth a look.",/review/rw3247649/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2016,claudio_carvalho,7," Beautiful Cinematography but Missing Explanation
","""Tomorrowland"" is a sci-fi adventure film with a beautiful cinematography and good cast, highlighting the gorgeous and talented girl Raffey Cassidy. There is good action scenes and special effects. Unfortunately the story fails since does not provide explanation about Tomorrowland. Is it an alternate dimension or a distant planet? How is exactly the connection between Earth and Tomorrowland and how does it affect Earth? Unless the viewer researches Internet, he or she will not find the answer in the film. Maybe the intention is to make a prequel with the missing explanation. But anyway it is worthwhile watching. My vote is seven.",/review/rw3247649/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2015,atlihafsteinsson,7," Hope
","That's what Tomorrowland is about. Hope. And imagination. It's a film that makes you believe in the future. Sadly, it seems that many of the reviewers here have lost that belief, and blame that on the film. Tomorrowland is not about how to change the world - it's about believing that we can. And we need that belief more than ever in our depressing modern society.",/review/rw3247649/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2015,StevePulaski,7," To put it optimistically...
","Disney's ""Tomorrowland"" may be a hot mess of ideas and ambition, but it's bound to inspire something in many viewers that few films today do, and that's visual wonder and imagination without a direct assault on the senses. A few weeks back, I saw ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" but the special effects on display in that particular film were used to show a gaggle of superheros waging complete war through cityscapes, making for quite the visual and auditory annihilation. ""Tomorrowland"" uses its incredible special effects to inspire that complex inside of us that finds itself neglected far too often.",/review/rw3247649/?ref_=tt_urv

","How many times have you heard ""Disney"" and ""Bombed at the Box Office""? Not many times , so, sit back and let me tell you about ""Tomorrowland: A World Beyond"" which was directed and co-written by Brad Bird who also directed ""The Iron Giant"" (1999), ""The Incredibles"" (2004), ""Ratatouille"" (2007), ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" (2011), and went on to direct ""Incredibles 2"" in 2018.",/review/rw3247649/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2015,aharmas,1," Incredibly Disappointing
","When the director of ""The Incredibles"" signed for this film, I was looking forward to the same amount of humor and exhilaration present in that animated masterpiece, something similar to what the little boy expresses when he realizes he can run on water. Nothing remotely close occurs in ""Tomorrowland"", a film that suffers from having too big a budget and hardly any original or exciting thoughts. It is also hindered by the fact that almost all of the actors appear clueless and not quite matching their characters. There's something about George Clooney being suave when needed and bit of an oddball in some other cases, but he's no Harrison Ford or Tom Cruise, and though the lead actress is pleasant to look at, she makes you wonder if casting directors shouldn't go through a more comprehensive training.",/review/rw3247649/?ref_=tt_urv

27 November 2015,Screen_Blitz,7," Imaginative science-fiction adventure will please the family
","This sci-fi action adventure, based on the popular attractions at the Walt Disney theme parks, follows the story of Casey Newton (played by Britt Robertson), a young teenager with a strong curiosity in science and technology who breaks in NASA's compound. After getting caught and arrested by cops, at the police station she receives a mysterious pin with a ""T"" on it. Upon picking it up, she instantly transports into an open field in a futuristic world known as ""Tomorrowland"". She begins exploring the futuristic environment of the land until the pin runs low on energy and she transported back into the real world. She enlisted the help of a disenchanted scientist Frank Walker (played by George Clooney), who knows about Tomorrowland, and an audio-automated robot named Athena (played by Raffey Cassidy), to travel the world of Tomorrowland where the future of the Earth is held and their actions affect how the future will sustain and the world around them. This is brought together by the visionary director Brad Bird who was responsible of the Pixar film 'The Incredibles' and 'Ratatouille'.",/review/rw3247649/?ref_=tt_urv

","Bird soars! Disney's fast paced sci-fi adventure is an entertaining package. With a great fantastical story in its vanguard, the flick unfurls into a beauty thanks to powerful performances by Clooney, Hugh Laurie and the brilliant Britt Robertson. What constantly gallops the story is its mystery quotient that unfolds gorgeously with luster, amazement and pizazz. Britt lets you see everything with her eyes of awe as you sit on her saddle to perceive the beauty of an unseen futuristic world that is not only downright advanced but marvelous too.",/review/rw3247649/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2015,Elledge_J,7," Okay, let me explain.
","I like this movie, well to say that I mean I like the movie up until they get to Tommorowland. The movie up until they get to Tommorowland is richly original and fun to watch. I thought it was cool seeing our characters traveling across the country and encountering sci-if stuff contrast to the homely city location. It was just such a fresh take on sci if and I was loving how it looked, but then we do go to Tomorrowland and it sucks. That's when things are confusing, and don't really excite as much as the first 60-70 minutes. I'm not saying removing the arrival to Tomorrowland would've made a more interesting movie, the movie just needed to make the Tomorrowland segment more interesting. But for the film they are getting across I liked it fairly well. After all this movie's heart is in the right place with a hopeful message. ",/review/rw3247649/?ref_=tt_urv

11 June 2015,rooee,7," Ahead of its time?
","Disney's conspicuously insistent ad campaign – more, more, MORE! – suggested a lack of confidence in their product, and while it hasn't sunk like John Carter, the relative failure of Brad Bird's latest is another nail in the coffin of original action-adventure movie-making, already incinerating plans for Tron 3, and likely setting the company's focus solely on stuff with ""Star Wars"" in the title for years to come.

7 June 2015,Ziya90,1," This is not the same man who brought us The Incredibles and Iron Giant
","I am a fan of Brad Bird. In fact, I was. I met him by Iron Giant and it made me cry despite I was not a kid! It was spectacular. Then I saw The Incredibles and it was incredible though. I will skip The Ghost Protocol, because it was a huge disappointment for me. Now, Tomorrowland... I went to see the movie because of three reasons: Brad Bird, George Clooney and as being a science fiction fan, because it was a sci-fi story. However, what I saw was a boring kids movie for TV channels with a daydreamer message in a bad way. Unfortunately, the kid characters were not likable in the movie and even Clooney was dull in this. He is one of my all time favorite actors. The story is rather ""ancient"" than boring, old themes, old twists etc. but the most important point here is that the story has a message which is ""use your imagination, you can be one of the chosen ones who are able to do time travel, change the world's destiny and save the world from evil aliens? Sorry, but it is not just uninspiring and boring, but also too naive which turns into ridiculousness in the end. All those action in the final chapter or that weird store owners who reveal their secret later in the film were just ridiculous. In the movie, there were lots of references to other movies such as that little girl reminded me Terminator 3 (you know what I mean) It is definitely not for the people who want a smart, brilliant or exciting sci-fi adventure. I had supposed that this movie would be Interstellar for kids, but I was definitely wrong! This is the worst Brad Bird movie so far. It has no art, no real entertainment and no cinema magic. Just a bunch of impressive visual effects and no more than that. If you want a time killer movie which you can watch with your kids in a Sunday morning, this movie is OK for you. It is not like some kids classics such as E.T. Goonies, Stand by Me, Back to the Future, Close Encounters etc.",/review/rw3247649/?ref_=tt_urv

","So, before I get to the movie, a word about some of the negative reviews here. Wow, there are so many! I'm not sure if they saw the same movie as I did, or if they are all just devoid of a sense of wonder and fun, but there are an awful lot of people that really disliked this movie. Of course, when you read their ""arguments"" (I'll be generous and call them that), you realize that most of their discontent stems from the fact that they thought the movie was going to be something else entirely.",/review/rw3247649/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2021,jboothmillard,6," Tomorrowland: A World Beyond
","Tomorrowland is one of the many themed lands featured in Magic Kingdom is Disney World, Florida, they turned it into a movie, which failed to make an impression at the box office, but is rated well by critics, so I watched it, directed by Brad Bird (The Iron Giant, The Incredibles, Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol). Basically, at the 1964 New York World's Fair, young Frank Walker (Thomas Robinson) attends to sell his prototype jet pack but is rejected as it does not work. Frank is approached by a young girl, Athena (Raffey Cassidy), who hands him an orange lapel pin with a blue ""T"" embossed on it, telling him to follow her onto Walt Disney's ""It's a Small World"" attraction at the Fair's Pepsi-Cola Pavilion. Frank obeys and sneaks onto the ride, where the pin is scanned by a laser, and he is transported to Tomorrowland, a futuristic cityscape, where advanced robots fix his jetpack, allowing him to fly and join the secretive world. In the present, adult Frank (George Clooney) passes the narration to the optimistic teenager Casey Newton (Britt Robertson), telling the story of how they met and all events thereafter. Casey repeatedly sabotages the planned demolition of a NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) launch site in Florida. Her father, Eddie (Tim McGraw), is a NASA engineer, but faces losing his job. Casey is eventually caught and arrested. At the police station, she finds a pin in her belongings. While touching the pin, it transports her to Tomorrowland. Her adventure is cut short when the pin's battery runs out. With help from her younger brother Nate (Pierce Gagnon), Casey finds a Houston memorabilia store related to the pin. She asks the owners Hugo (Keegan-Michael Key) and Ursula (Kathryn Hahn) for information about the pin, but they attack her when she does not tell them where she got the pin from, insisting that Casey knows about a ""little girl"". Athena bursts in and defeats the owners, revealed to be animatronics, who self-destruct, blowing up the shop. After Casey and Athena steal a car, Athena reveals she is an animatronic, designed to find and recruit people who fit the ideals of Tomorrowland. Athena drops Casey off at the adult Frank's house in Pittsfield, New York. The reclusive, cynical Frank declines Casey's request to take her to Tomorrowland, having been banished from it years ago. Inside Frank's house, Casey finds a countdown clock predicting the probability of the end of the world. Frank warns her that the future is doomed, but she disagrees. Animatronic assassins arrive to kill Casey, but she and Frank escape, meeting Athena in the woods outside Frank's house. Frank resents Athena for lying to him about her true nature, but reluctantly agrees to help them get to Tomorrowland. Using a teleportation device, the trio travel to the top of the Eiffel Tower. Frank explains that Gustave Eiffel, Jules Verne, Nikola Tesla, and Thomas Edison co-founded Plus Ultra, a secret society of futurists, creating Tomorrowland in another dimension, free to make scientific breakthroughs without obstruction. The trio use antique rocket the Spectacle, hidden beneath the Eiffel Tower, to travel to Tomorrowland. Upon arrival, they find Tomorrowland in a state of decay. Tomorrowland's governor David Nix (Hugh Laurie) greets them. They travel to a tachyon machine, invented by Frank, which accurately predicted the worldwide catastrophe. Casey refuses to accept the end of the world, causing the future to temporarily alter. While Frank attempts to convince Nix to listen, he refuses and wants the group to leave Tomorrowland. Casey realises the tachyon machine is telling humanity that the world will end, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. They confront Nix, who admits he tried to warn humanity by projecting such images to prevent the future, but they embraced the apocalypse, refusing to act to make a better future. Believing that humanity simply gave up, Nix has also given up and intends to allow the apocalypse to happen. Casey, Frank, and Athena attempt to use a bomb to destroy the machine, leading to a fight with Nix. The bomb is accidentally thrown through a portal to an uninhabited island on Earth, the explosion pinning Nix's leg. Athena sees a vision of the future where Frank is shot by Nix, and she jumps in the path of this attack, mortally wounding herself. Making peace with Frank, Athena activates her self-destruct sequence, destroying the machine which falls on Nix, killing him. In the present, Casey and Frank become leaders of Tomorrowland, recruiting Eddie and Nate, and sending recruitment animatronics to give pins to recruit new dreamers and thinkers for Tomorrowland. Also starring Chris Bauer as Frank's Dad and Judy Greer as Jenny Newton. Robertson is amiable as the inquisitive science buff, Clooney is likeable as the gruff inventor, Laurie in a pivotal role is good, and Cassidy steals many scenes as the snappy child android. The story has its complications, with time travel, environmental issues, and philosophy at the forefront, but for its retro-cool style, wonderful eye-catching set pieces, action-packed scenes, and spectacular special effects to bring futuristic technology to life, it is a watchable science-fiction adventure.

29 May 2015,The-Sarkologist,2," Why on earth did I watch this movie?
","I really have no idea why I went and actually wasted my time watching this movie. I first learnt about it when a friend posted a trailer on Facebook saying that it looked cool (actually I think the word was 'awesome'), and when I watched the trailer my impression was: yeah, not really. Yet for some reason I still wanted to go and see it, despite that part of me knowing that it was going to be dull and boring. It turned out it even worse than that, to the point that I ended up falling asleep, and no matter how hard I tried I simply could not wake up. It was almost as if I really wanted this to end because I was not enjoying it at all.",/review/rw3247649/?ref_=tt_urv
