15 July 2005,JamesHitchcock,8," A British Romantic Comedy as Good as Hollywood at its Best
","Richard Curtis's films have sometimes been criticised for giving a too cosy, conservative view of British society. ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" seems to take place in an England of eternal summer, a land which consists almost entirely of green and pleasant countryside and the more exclusive districts of London and which is populated solely by members of the upper and upper-middle classes. The script does cross the border into an equally idealised Scotland of mists, tartans and Highland flings, but even these scenes were actually shot in Surrey. Such criticism contains an element of truth, but is largely irrelevant when it comes to assessing the merits of the film because it ignores the fact that most romantic comedies (in other media as well as in the cinema) are set against a relatively narrow background in terms of social class, often enabling the writer to satirise the manners of that class. Jane Austin, for example, the most successful writer of romantic comedy in nineteenth-century England, set all her works among the wealthy landed gentry or prosperous bourgeoisie of the day.",/review/rw0339408/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2001,jhclues,9," Rich In Story and Characters
","The effects of personal want, need, love and desire on the friendships of a circle of eclectic individuals is examined with a spot of humor in the witty, clever and oh-so-British comedy of love, romance and finding that special someone, `Four Weddings and a Funeral,' directed by Mike Newell. Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell head a delightful ensemble cast in this story of a group of long-time friends, all single, who watch and participate over a period of months as one by one those amongst them step up at last to the altar.  Of them all, Charles (Grant) seems the most likely-- and at the same time the least likely-- to be next.  Young, handsome and charismatic, Charles has no problem developing a relationship (he's had a number, in fact, as we learn in one particularly hilarious scene), but sustaining one is seemingly beyond his grasp.  Until, at the wedding of one of his friends, he meets Carrie (MacDowell), an American, and she quickly enchants him.  It is not the end of the story, however; for Charles, Carrie and the audience, it's only-- as they say-- the beginning.",/review/rw0339408/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2002,jckruize,9," Droll romantic comedy showcases Hugh Grant in his best role.
","Richard Curtis, author of Rowan Atkinson's sublime Blackadder TV series, here contributes a romantic comedy screenplay which is actually romantic AND actually funny.  American hacks should take note:  it's possible to write comedy based on the battle of the sexes that doesn't rely on misogyny and gross-out humor.",/review/rw0339408/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2006,dglink,9," Quirky Characters Shine in Touching, Funny, Romantic Comedy
","The lead character in this film, Charles, says at one point that, while  his friends were busily obsessed with marriage, two members of their  group were, for all intents and purposes, married to each other. In  those days before Britain had a civil partnership law, he was referring  to Gareth and Matthew, played by Simon Callow and John Hannah. ""Four  Weddings and a Funeral"" was among the first major films to feature a  gay couple without any comment, moralizing, or stereotyping.  Considering all of the absurd controversy generated by ""Brokeback  Mountain,"" this English comedy may be considered subversive in some  quarters, because it portrays the union between the two men to be as  loving and enduring as any between the men and a women in the same  film.  The two gay men are among a circle of idiosyncratic friends that orbit  around Charles, who suffers from relationship avoidance. Played  engagingly by Hugh Grant, Charles attends the weddings of others,  but manages to avoid any commitment of his own. One of the film's  funniest scenes involves Charles at a wedding reception where he has  been seated at a table with several of his ex-girlfriends. With that  one scene, screenwriter Richard Curtis wittily fleshes out Charles's  character as each woman remarks on her past experience.  The episodic comedy is broken down literally into the five events of  the title, and the core characters attend these events as spectators  who each hope for a wedding of their own. Many of the lines and  situations are extremely funny. Rowan Atkinson steals his brief time as  a novice preacher who blesses a couple ""in the name of the Father, the  Son, and the holy goat."" Although Hugh Grant plays Charles as, well,  Hugh Grant, several other actors create some fine comic turns. The  ravishing Kristin Scott Thomas is touching as the lonely Fiona, and her  timing is impeccable when she recovers from an indelicate question with  a snappy comeback. Of course, why anyone as beautiful as Kristin Scott  Thomas should be unwillingly single is a minor casting flaw in the  film. Unfortunately, Andie MacDowell plays the American, Carrie, and,  although she looks great in a hat, she fails to generate the necessary  charisma to convincingly be Charles's object of desire.  However, the low wattage generated by the two leads does little to  dampen the hilarity or the pathos of this excellent film. While, at  nearly two hours, the movie is long for a comedy, the structure and  quirky characters easily sustain interest throughout. With ""Four  Weddings and a Funeral,"" director Mike Newell has made one of the best  romantic comedies, and the film holds up to repeated viewings.",/review/rw0339408/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 1999,Spleen,9," A note to the anti-Andie brigade
","I'm blind to the alleged charm of Andie MacDowell myself.  That's why I think that casting her in this film was a stroke of genius, for so far as my senses tell me she perfectly fits the character she plays: a dull beauty who casts a spell over one out of every twenty men she meets, leaving the remaining nineteen cold and completely baffled.  Charlie (Hugh Grant) is surrounded by MUCH more desirable female friends - even Duckface has something going for her - but instead of so much as noticing them he falls head over heels for an unattainable woman who is, on top of everything else, boring.  Would have been as good as it is if Charlie's passion had made SENSE?  Of course not.",/review/rw0339408/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2000,tfrizzell,," A Nice Little Film That Charmed Its Way to a Best Picture Nod in 1994
","""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" is a nice little film from 1994.  It did fair at the box office and did fair with critics.  The Academy was charmed enough to award the film with a Best Picture nomination.  The film deals with a British bachelor (Hugh Grant) who continues to run into a beautiful young American (Andie McDowell) at various weddings in England.  As the film progresses their lust for each other turns into love and the finale is a real triumph.  This film is a comedy for the most part, but its elements of drama put it above most films that go primarily for laughs.  The screenplay is smart and the supporting cast is excellent.  Kristin Scott Thomas and Rowan Atkinson (albeit in a very small role) are memorable.  4 out of 5 stars.",/review/rw0339408/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2011,elspeth-11,," Mostly enjoyable - needs a different ending
","I really enjoyed most of this movie - the funeral was devastating. And unlike many, I really do enjoy the standard Hugh Grant (which, in fairness, was not yet ""standard"" when this movie was new).",/review/rw0339408/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2005,bob the moo,," OK but not worth the reputation it has surprisingly held with it over the past decade
","Charles' habit of being late to pretty much everything he does and attends doesn't stop him being best man at a friend's wedding. While there he meets (and beds) the delightful American Carrie and finds himself quite attracted to her and regrets that she flies back to America the same day. At another wedding he meets her again but finds that she has gotten engaged to a rather rich Scottish man and is off the market  although that doesn't stop her sleeping with Charles again. As her wedding approaches, Charles begins to realise that his marrying days are fast passing him by and the woman that he loves may never be his.",/review/rw0339408/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2001,peacham,," Delightful Diversion
","""Four Weddings And A Funeral"" is indeed a delightful little comedy with some wondeful writing and polished performances.Hugh Grant shines in a role that unfortunately left Him typecast to this day (for a different side of Grant see his brilliant Fredrich Chopin in ""Impromptu"".) and Kristen Scott Thomas is perfect as the enigmatic Fiona...witty,beautiful and touching. Simon Callow nearly steals the film as Gareth..He is one of the world's finest stage actors and its nice to see him get a film role he can really sink his teeth into. Andie McDowall is very convincing as the object of Grant's affection  and Corin Redgrave has a well acted cameo as McDowall's fiancee Hamish. over all a jolly good film,funny,touching and sharp.",/review/rw0339408/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,9," Never less than hugely enjoyable
","While starting off a little on the slow side, this film is never less than hugely enjoyable. The tale of the bachelor, his friends and their romantic escapades is constantly charming, witty, poignant and most of all funny, and the humour here is suitably understated. The film further benefits from being superbly written, beautifully filmed and sharply directed with a well structured story that could have easily have been episodic. Also whereas there have been films where I have been indifferent to the characters, the script ensured that the characters were warm and easy to empathise with. I think it is also to do with the quality of the acting, with Hugh Grant at his most charming, Andie MacDowell at her most enigmatic and Simon Callow and Kristen Scott-Thomas especially outstanding among the supporting cast.",/review/rw0339408/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2009,long-ford,," Delightful romantic comedy despite uneven Andie MacDowell
","This film is a delightful romantic comedy with some measure of poignancy. Seamlessly directed by Mike Newell, the film has Hugh Grant in top form playing a stiff and slightly bumbling Englishman, a role he has patented over the years. The entire cast chips in well with some fine understated British humor. Rowan Atkinson has a short but hilarious cameo. Andie MacDowell is the only odd member in the cast. She is surprisingly uneven and her last scene is a shocker. There's a (MINOR SPOILERS) poignant funeral later in the film with John Hannah delivering an impassioned eulogy. Worth watching.",/review/rw0339408/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2006,jeffvaughn,9," wonderfully funny movie
","I am viewing the movie for my fifth time since its release. I just love this movie and laugh almost endless throughout the movie. My favorite parts of this movie are not the ""Hollywood A List"" actors but the not so well known actors. They are incredibly funny and give wonderful performances. I could easily write a bit about each actor in this movie but time does not permit. These are some very talented people. As a fan of British humor, I am especially pleased with the incredible writing along with the acting. Not to mention some of the scenery. If someone is feeling low, this is a great movie to watch to lift the spirits. I highly recommend this movie to anyone wanting or needing a good laugh.",/review/rw0339408/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2012,rooprect,7," Hated it when I saw it in '94, loved it last night
","When I saw this film in '94, I was expecting something a little snappier & edgier like the rom-coms of the time (such as ""Singles"" or ""When Harry Met Sally"").

9 March 2015,Tweekums,9," Laughter and tears as Hugh Grant finds love at Four Weddings and a Funeral
","Charles has attended many weddings with his group of unmarried friends; none were his though. Then, at a wedding where he is the best man, he sees Carrie and it is love at first sight. Things seem to go well and he spends the night with her; then she says she must return to the United States. He doesn't expect to see her again but a few months later, while attending another wedding, he meets her again the 'best wedding ever' quickly becomes the worst though when he learns that she is now engaged; that doesn't stop him sleeping with her again though. The next wedding is Carries and this goes well enough; right up until Charles's friend Gareth collapses and dies. After the funeral it is time for another wedding; this time Charles is getting married the question is who is his bride and is he over Carrie?",/review/rw0339408/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2021,mark.waltz,7," By the third wedding, I started cleaning up the living room.
","It was all so repetitive, certainly very funny in spots, at least when Hugh Grant was onscreen. There's a reason why throughout the 1990's, he was a top star and quite in demand. But how often can you play the stereotypical awkward young Englishman and keep it fresh? Well, he managed to do it, and here, he is definitely in top form.",/review/rw0339408/?ref_=tt_urv

9 June 2005,planktonrules,2," a morally bankrupt ""love story""
","When movies like this gain the popularity that they do, I feel concerned for the moral plight of our world. I'm sure this sounds awfully preachy, but I am serious. When I watched this film, I was totally turned off by the ""romance"" between Hugh Grant and Andie McDowell. Think about it, folks! These two don't know each other at all. They happen to meet at a wedding and screw like weasels in heat! Then, they leave and don't see each other until the next wedding, where they once again screw like weasels. This happens several times and there is no love, no commitment--just pointless sex. I would have REALLY loved it after a while if they would have had the characters get STDs--then at least the movie would have had some point! It's ironic that the same pointless sex is exactly what the real life High Grant got himself involved in with that skanky prostitute only a few years later. Given the message movies like these make, the next ones caught with prostitutes might just be our own children--after all, the message these movies give is ""do what feels good and damn the consequences"".",/review/rw0339408/?ref_=tt_urv

","So let me get this straight. There's this British bloke who sleeps with this American gal. Just once, mind you. But despite this, he falls hopelessly in love. However, she leaves and doesn't call him back. Then when they see each other again, she's engaged. But for some reason she sleeps with him again. Oh, and then she takes him out shopping with her. As if that isn't torture enough, she's shopping for a wedding dress and makes him watch as she tries on various gowns. What kind of woman is this? And why should I give a damn about her? And how the hell can the filmmakers expect me to be happy when these two imbeciles end up getting married? But then again this a Working Title picture and a film scripted by Richard Curtis.
