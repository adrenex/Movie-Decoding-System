","In Mexico Officer Javier Rodriquez Rodriquez is stuck in the middel of a country where the drug dealers and the police work hand in hand and murder is rife.  In the USA the head of one of the cartels Javier is trying to close is taken to court by the DEA who have an informant (Eduardo Ruiz) in the custody of Agents Montel Gordon and Ray Castro, leaving his wife, Helena, to take care of his business.

16 July 2001,MadReviewer,9," The Real Best Film of 2000
","A dazzlingly complex film, `Traffic' takes a hard, unflinching look at the so-called `war on drugs' that is perfectly clear and uncompromising. Director Steven Soderbergh takes the various viewpoints of the drug culture -- the users, the dealers, the police, and the politicians -- and weaves their differing stories together into a single story that is both deep in its ideas but very simple to understand.  In terms of story, direction, and characters, `Traffic' is easily Soderbergh's best film to date, and one of the best films made in recent years, period.",/review/rw2621199/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2005,don_agu,9," A Sodebergh Binge
","Yep, I'm on a full Sodebergh binge. I've been crazy about him ever since ""King of The Hill"" and he, very rarely, lets me down. I couldn't say that about many people including siblings and lovers. ""Traffic"" is not a departure for Sodebergh, all of his films are. He is an artist with a golden touch. He can travel through opposing universes with amazing ease. In ""Traffic"" the universe is uncomfortable, muddy, almost ugly and yet, it fascinates and attracts with the power of a magic magnet. Benicio del Toro and Erika Christensen are the two inhabitants of this peculiar universe that get under your skin and carry with you as if they were part of a personal experience. No, not if. They do, they are, they become part of a personal experience. The film allows you that. It makes you learn without preaching. How many films today manage that?",/review/rw2621199/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2006,ccthemovieman-1,6," Not A Fun Ride To Take In This Traffic, But A Fascinating Trip
","This is an ugly story but still fascinating to watch, at least once. I'm not sure about more than twice, at least from my experience. It's too much of a downer to enjoy regularly but I do recommend a minimum of one viewing for the unique way it's presented, especially for those who like a different visual/audio approach.",/review/rw2621199/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2001,bigrogges,10," Traffic delivers a powerful message with impeccable flair.
","Early in the year 2000, director Steven Soderbergh's film, Erin Brokovich, sizzled at the box office  (bringing in over $130 million) while receiving critical acclaim.  Now, with the release of his latest film, Traffic, Soderbergh stands to earn Oscar nominations for Best Director and Best Picture for both of these movies.  It's no wonder, either, as Traffic is one of the most gripping films to hit theatres in 2000.",/review/rw2621199/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2001,the_eggman,," Technically great, acting's great, the whole damn thing's great
","It certainly has been a good 12 months for director Stephen Soderbergh, hasn't it? Erin Brockovich, probably the most underrated film of last year, eventually got the recognition Soderbergh, Roberts +Co deserved, as did this film, a chilling account of drug trafficking in North and Central America. As seen in 'Erin Brockovich', Soderbergh often deals with people under immense pressure, and this is quite evident here, telling the story of a new US drug control officer (Michael Douglas) whose daughter is rapidly becoming a drug addict (Erika Christensen). It also shows us the struggles of a drug trafficker's society wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones), whose husband is facing a conviction, and also that of a cop accused of corruption. The direction is superb throughout, speaking in tones, very believable tones, and contrasting atmospheres. The portrayal of Mexico, as a behind-the-scenes nightmare world of seediness, humidity (you can almost FEEL the heat) and as a place where one murder matters not, is handled excellently, Soderbergh quite cleverly using sepiatones to convey the mood. This high standard, which is often difficult to maintain in a movie of its length (2 ½ hours) is maintained, and while at times it borders on arty, it is done thoughtfully, incisively and effectively, the scenes of importance delivered in tense, muted tones. Javier Rodriguez's (Benicio Del Toro) character and personality is both strong and incredibly well-acted - the quiet, thick skinned yet razor-sharp mind suiting his environment perfectly, and his acting is often crucial to the moods set in the film, for example in creating the tense, unearthly atmosphere of Mexico. This quiet confidence is also a key part of one of the film's many underlying messages, namely a study in resourcefulness and where it gets us, particularly in Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, a trophy wife of a drug trafficker who is under arrest. Resourceful as she is, it takes her down the darkest and lowest moral alleyways, and this can be compared to 'Erin Brockovich', where another stressed woman used a different kind of soul and fighting spirit to get results. This film also deals with family life, and the movie cliché of 'daddy never being around' is handled exceptionally well. This time the daddy is the newly-instated drugs officer (Michael Douglas) fighting drugs on two fronts: the Mexican Border and his own home, as he struggles to keep his adolescent daughter on the straight and narrow. The characters are all strong and well acted, I can't put my finger on a single bad performance, but Benicio Del Toro is by far the best on show and his Oscar was well deserved. Michael Douglas proves again that he's a class act, as does Catherine Zeta-Jones and strength in depth is clear all round. All in all, then, a great film, combining good acting, clever psychological undertones and classy direction, which particularly stands out. Combining an ability to keep us interested with the snappy, modern style which he has brought to the movies today - this film is a gripping account and a very comprehensive display of Soderbergh's impressive arsenal of film knowledge, understanding and talent.",/review/rw2621199/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2001,subir1,9," All you could ask for.
","No compromises here.  Traffic takes a long, hard look at the narcotics industry in North America and manages to entertain at the same time. The triple plot allows you to see the whole industry with multiple perspectives. The movie is visually stunning, loved the different filters for the three locations.",/review/rw2621199/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2001,mkrotov,10," the best american film of 2000
","Traffic is an incredible movie. The director, Steven Soderbergh (sex, lies and videotape, out of sight, erin brockovich, etc...) has created a film that combines elements of Hollywood and independent filmmaking. On one hand, he has created an epic that has a very wide scope and has used some famous Hollywood actors. On the other hand, as the cameraman for the film, he has shot it with a handheld camera and and makes the film visually very different from traditional films. He presents the drug war in the United States from three perspectives. The first is of a police officer (superbly played by Benicio del Toro)in Tijuana struggling with the difficult situations that such a job creates in the center of drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States. Catherine Zeta Jones plays the wife of the leader of a drug cartel in San Diego who gets arrested. Once naive about his business, she takes charge of the operations. The third story deals with the appointment of conservative Ohio Supreme Court justice Robert Wakefield, played by Michael Douglas, to the post of drug czar. This occurs while his daughter Caroline, portrayed emotionally by Erika Christensen starts descending into a world of drugs thanks to her boyfriend Seth Abrahams. (Topher Grace from ""That 70's Show"" plays Seth) These three stories are distinguishable visually. The Tijuana story is shot with different tones of yellow, giving everything that goes on in the story a feel similar to that of a hot desert. The San Diego story has warm soft colors, representing Helena Ayala's (Catherine Zeta Jones' character) once peaceful social soccer mom life. Finally, Cincinatti and Washington, D.C., the cities where the story of the drug czar takes place is shot in a cold blue, giving it an emotionless feel. Despite the importance of the visuals, what makes this film that much better is the fact that Soderbergh does not moralize. There is not an anti-drug stance but there is also not a strong advocacy of legalization. Traffic shows a problem with no current solution. The viewer has to decide for himself. 10/10",/review/rw2621199/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2000,xraymonkey71,10," Soderbergh's best film is a thrilling ride...
","The film more than delivers on every level and is certainly a lock for Best Picture of the year. Soderbergh has been on an astonishing roll, demonstrating exceptional versatility in his choice of genres and tremendous agility in balancing artistry with entertainment. He's been America's most consistently brilliant and unpredictable filmmaker for the last decade, and Traffic is the culminating work of his career. First and foremost, it's a richly entertaining epic that recalls the great works of the 1970s, when directors like Robert Altman and Francis Ford Coppola engaged mass audiences with works of genuine substance. Soderbergh works on a larger canvass than he's ever done before, bouncing several characters and plot-lines against and off each other, so that images and themes rhyme and echo. Although the subject matter is drug trafficking, this is not an ""issues"" movie per se. Instead, it's a profoundly affecting dramatic thriller where the destructive forces of drugs cut across different sections of society. What's most impressive about the direction is how Soderbergh manages to avoid both sentimentalizing and moralizing about drugs. As with Erin Brockovich, there's a graceful absence of self-importance and bombast in the presentation. However, this doesn't mean the film lacks a strong point of view.",/review/rw2621199/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2001,Bob-45,3," Like Finding an Obscure Address in the Middle of a Big City at Rush Hour
","`Traffic' is certainly an appropriate title for this movie.  The only way I can closely approximate the experience is to compare it to trying to find an obscure address in the middle of a big city at rush hour.  While much of what is going on is of great importance, much is simply distracting. Director Steven Sonderberg manages to keep everything confusing enough so it is pretty easy not to care which is which.   Perhaps the best comparison is the television series `Cops'.  While `Cops' portrays actual police operations, the technical limitations of portable equipment and uncontrolled environment makes it SEEM less realistic than, say, `Law and Order'. However, `Cops'  has the consistent sheen of betacam under either natural or ugly sodium lighting.  By contrast, `Traffic' looks like home movies developed by five different drug stores.",/review/rw2621199/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2011,g-bodyl,9," Wow!
","All I can say about this film is wow. This film should make people more aware of drug trafficking issues in America. Even though this is not a documentary, it feels like one. This is one of the best movies of 2000 and I see why Steven Soderbergh won best director.",/review/rw2621199/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2007,ametaphysicalshark,," Mediocre and unchallenging film
","Here's a film which looks amazing, but lacks substance. That is quite odd, considering the fact that this is a film which wants to be deep and carefully tries to avoid clichéd Hollywood storytelling. Of course, thanks to ""Crash"" and Inarritu's films the 'interlocking drama' has now become a cliché, and perhaps looking at this film seven years later after seeing all the films it has influenced lends it a disadvantage. ""Traffic"" tells three stories, one of a politician in the US who is hired to head the war on drugs and has a drug addicted daughter, one of a trophy wife who attempts to save her jailed husband's drug business, and one of a corrupt Mexican cop who struggles with his conscience after discovering that his boss may not be the ardent anti-drug official he thought he was.",/review/rw2621199/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2012,planktonrules,10," A very complex plot that all boils down to one thing...futility.
","""Traffic"" is a VERY complex film--one with many different plots occurring all over the United States and Mexico. What makes this very unusual is that many of the plots are NOT clearly interconnected. So, what one group of characters do in Cincinnati or San Diego might have nothing directly to do with folks in Mexico or DC--at least not until later in the film. Indirectly, though, they are all part of the drug trafficking world as well as the war on drugs. Together, these many different stories all paint a very, very grim picture--a picture of futility about our government's attempts to get a handle on the illegal drug trade. Because of the fine craftsmanship in making the film, you can't help but be pulled into their message that what we are doing now simply isn't working. Clearly, the film is trying to make a political statement. And, if you don't believe its message, you sure will have your thinking challenged. And, you have to respect what this film has accomplished.",/review/rw2621199/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2020,areatw,7," A deep and complex film about America's drug problem
","'Traffic' is an impressive drama/thriller that provides a detailed insight into America's war on drugs. The film takes a 'neutral' stance, giving the perspective of multiple people on both sides without pushing an anti-drug agenda.

","This movie further sustains the fact that no matter what role Douglas plays(with the exception of Falling Down), Douglas acts exactly the same.

21 June 2012,KnightsofNi11,9," Visceral yet human
","With films like Traffic and Requiem for a Dream, drugs seemed to be a pretty big deal in the year 2000. But only one of these two films was recognized by ole Oscar, and that was Traffic. Not to say that Traffic is better than Requiem for a Dream, but I'd say it's a pretty close race. Traffic is a vignette of three different story arcs with a cavalcade of characters who are almost all played by huge names like Michael Douglas and Benicio Del Toro, who won an Oscar for his performance as Javier Rodriguez, a man from Tiujana working for the police gathering information about the drug cartels. The other story lines are Catherine Zeta-Jones' story as a wife whose husband gets arrested for drug trafficking, and she must clean up his own mess, and Michael Douglas as a conservative judge who is appointed by the President to helm the war on drugs, only to find out that his own daughter is an addict. It's an intense, dark, gritty, and harrowing film represents the brutality and futility of the drug war.",/review/rw2621199/?ref_=tt_urv

","Well ,after watching it a few times before ,I've finally decided to review this movie. I must admit that some of the filming teachings were interesting and gave some scenes more atmosphere--the geography of the whole story made it a lot better too. The cast was good ;most of it were into their characters-both main and others (especielly Benicio Del Toro ,Michael Douglas ,and Erika Christensen)--and most of the characters were human and had interesting developments during the movie. The movie was sometimes too messy with sub plots and it was pretty long too ,but the whole thing was good with a message and deep characters which wasn't really predictable nor limited ;it was about a thing that most movies just don't touch this aspect of everyday life.",/review/rw2621199/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2017,Screen_Blitz,8," Steven Soderbergh spawns an ambitious and gripping examination on the American drug wars
","Drugs are bad, not doubt about it. But the worst and most incomprehensible aspect about drug usage is the complex politics that go behind the dirty business. From the government of the higher hierarchy to the law enforcement roaming around on the streets, the American war on drugs is a complicated business from inside and out. Morals are tested and families are threatened, and the consequences behind the illegal drug business are, more or less, as tragic as what director Steven Soderbergh displays on screen. Capturing its political concept in multiple story lines, Soderbergh straps audiences into a gripping portrayal of a society brought its knees by the illegal drug trade and the violent repercussions of the contraband activity, all while gripping us with an emotional resonance surrounding the gritty nature of a world run amok by moral ambiguity. The film, revolving around the American war on drugs, is told of three intertwining perspectives. The first one follows two Mexican police officers Javier Rodriguez (played by Benicio Del Toro) and Manolo Sanchez (played by Jacob Vargas) who are tasked by their boss Arturo Salazar (played by Tomas Milian) to take down the Juarez drug cartel, on to themselves wrapped up in a double-crossing scheme. A second following one following two DEA agents Montel Gordon (played by Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (played by Luis Guzman) who capture a local drug dealer who in return, rats out his boss Carlos Ayala (played by Steven Bauer), who is arrested and must face trial under the defense of his attorney (played by Dennis Quaid) while his wife (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) and child are threatened by his accomplices. Then a third one following a Ohio conservative judge Robert Wakefield (played by Michael Douglas) who learns his teenage daughter has become hooked on heroin.",/review/rw2621199/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2012,Marc_Israel_365,9," Connecting the dots of the US drug war failures
","Finally a movie about the drug abuse epidemic that tells the truth, is broad enough to tell an international story and that illustrates in such an entertaining and meaningful way. Writing liberties are taken, once going too far, but the point is that you have to push boundaries in these discussions. The combination of brutal honesty, teenage speeches, Beltway hypocrisy, the futility of the current U.S. Government direction, the hope brought on by living one day at a time make this the best picture to ask the question ""what can we do about the culture of drug abuse in the U.S.?"" The acting is spot on and the cinematography frames each character, coloring them appropriately.",/review/rw2621199/?ref_=tt_urv
