28 July 2019,hitchcockthelegend,8," Let me give you some advice. Assume everyone will betray you. And you will never be disappointed.
","So the latest in what is becoming a long running sci-fi franchise sees Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich) get his prequel movie. Unsurprisingly, such is the ferocious core fan base of the Star Wars series, it has been met with a mixture of outright hatred to pats on the back appreciation. It really is a case here of jumping in to view it on its own terms to at least give it a chance. The truth is, is that if this was a stand alone movie being judged purely as a science fiction action movie, then it would be better appreciated. For this is cracker jack entertainment in that sphere, with superbly constructed worlds inhabited by delirious looking aliens species, feisty droids hold court, and the humans are daring, cheeky and even sexy. It is in short quality and fantastical sci-fi, even if in truth as per the Solo character trajectory it's safe film making.",/review/rw4180105/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2018,planktonrules,8," There are already over 2000 reviews for this....

18 July 2019,FluffyPantsReviews,9," Why do I like the Star Wars spin-offs more?
","This and Rogue One are my favorite Star Wars movies. Alden Ehrenreich is so good in this movie as Han Solo. Love the whole sequence of him trying to escape the planet with Kira at the beginning. One of my favorite scenes in Star Wars is when you see Han Solo fighting on the side of the Empire on MImban. Some of the best 7 minutes in Star Wars. The whole Kessel Run sequence is good just not my favorite. The 3rd act is unique with a shoot out in a small room. Love the twist with Enfys Nest that Han actually kinda started the Rebellion. Stand out characters include Han, Chewie, Lando, and Tobias Beckett. Love the whole Conveyex robbery scene. Love new Star Wars vehicles and troopers and some standouts include heavy Tie Fighter, Conveyex, imperial At hauler, Mud Trooper, Mimban Trooper, and Range Trooper. Just such a fun ride and the pace is so good.",/review/rw4180105/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2018,vandykeu,7," It's better than the new trilogy
","I liked Solo.... much more than I anticipated I would. Like many people posting reviews, I am an old-school, die-hard fan of the original trilogy, and I am also a fan of the old ""extended universe"", much of which is now being overshadowed by the cash-grab that is this new Disney-driven galaxy.",/review/rw4180105/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2018,poopville,7," A non-hateful Star Wars fan who liked it
","So I am of the generation who got to experience Star Wars feom the beginning. Standing in a crazy ling line, literally wrapped around the local theater back in 1977 as a kid. Totally unaware I was about to see a movie that would become my central interest for all my childhood, early teens and once again as an adult. And all these years later, able to share this fandom with my own son. 
I liked Solo. I wouldn't say it's my favorite but it was a fun ride and it evoked the feelings that I associate with Stat Wars. The world and characters felt right. It showed us some cool new things about life in that world, living under the Empire. The amazing cityscapes of Corellia... It felt similar to me to Rogue One. Modern filmmaking techniques yet convincingly evoking the vibes of the classic Star Wars world. 
Anyway, I just wanted to put in some positive review for this movie to contrast this strange wave of hate feom ""fans"" on here. I don't really understand it. I have liked something about every Star Wars movie there has been. Some are better than others. There are weaker moments in every one to be sure. But none are worth the irrational seeming hate some people are putting out there.
Solo is good and worth your time if you like Star Wars. Just one fan's opinion.",/review/rw4180105/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2020,Hallelujah289,9," Impressive!
","Have so far been disappointed with the Star Wars revamp series. ""Solo"" is a refreshing exception. Stays true to characters, while introducing new ones that add to the Star Wars world, and genuinely enriches Han Solo's backstory. Well done! Also features a new score, and sets into motion important story events concerning the rebellion Han Solo would be a part of later. Recommended!",/review/rw4180105/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2018,CANpatbuck3664,8," A Fun Sci-Fi Heist Flick When Viewed Independently From the Star Wars Saga
","Solo: A Star Wars Story boasts one of the more inventive plots I've seen lately. They play with Han's story and aren't afraid to take it some unexpected directions (at least for those just familiar with the movies and haven't researched to extended continuity of the franchise). One of the small problems I had with Solo was while the movie does have some intriguing ideas and exciting sequences, they reside in the middle of the movie. The bookends of this movie (beginning and end) are the weakest with all the best stuff in middle hour and a half. This isn't a major flaw, but I had to be patient for it to get going and the finale felt a little rushed.",/review/rw4180105/?ref_=tt_urv

5 June 2018,mm-39,8," Back on track!
","Solo is an improvement over the latest Star Wars installments. The C G I is getting old, but the rest of the film is an improvement. Solo sheds the recent era of flat 2 d characters with predicable flat stories. No one needs a simple message hit over the audience head. What we have is a flawed hero Solo. All the character have good a bad which is creates realistic character which the audience relate with. Complexities of the character resonates into more believable/interesting story. Many answers of how Solo got the Falcon, and the ugly way Solo and Chewie became friends. People/aliens are self interested and ugly which creates good humor. Well written, directed, with out a bogged down social message, but with a good sic-fi message. Eight out of ten. Red meat for the Star Wars fans.",/review/rw4180105/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2018,airsoftquartermaster,7," Better than TheLast Jedi
","Better than I feared it would be, Solo is a different type of star wars film, which I welcome. No lightsabres, no mention of the force, and no big climactic battle. 
 Alden Ehrenreich is passable as Solo,I found myself warming to him towards the end. Emilia Clarke is completely wooden and the most memorable thing about Woody Harrelson is his bad wig.
 Effects are excellent as you would expect, the set pieces (train heist, kessel run and the end fight with Paul Bettany are good. Only the middlesags because of Clarke's poor acting.

","Am a big fan of the original 'Star Wars' trilogy, with 'The Empire Strikes Back' my favourite but 'A New Hope' is a genre and film landmark. Don't mind the prequels actually but they are very flawed and vastly inferior. Loved 'The Force Awakens', liked very much 'Rogue One' and liked 'The Last Jedi' better than most while considering it a very uneven film.",/review/rw4180105/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2018,thatchermacdonald,10," Very enjoyable, why so negative everybody?
","Wow, some people are never pleased. This movie was enjoyable to the very end. How can anyone who is remotely interested in Star Wars not enjoy can entire movie dedicated to Han and Chewy??? And this wasn't a cheap production either. The best part is Disney kept their political agenda relatively at bay with this film, unlike the main saga films. So refreshing and rare these days.

18 August 2022,deruytterwolfgang,7," Doesn't deserve the hate
","It doesn't deserve the hate. It's actually really good. It does exactly what it's supposed to do. I think it's revolutionary for star wars,let me explain. This is a very different movie than the rest of the star wars movies. There are no lightsabers (well except that one time) and there is no darth vader or Luke skywalker, there isn't a fight between good and evil, it's more of fight between thieves. That causes that this movie feels very different, it almost feels like this is not a star wars movie. And that's great. A great change of pace. It feels more like a cowboy space adventure, which is something the mandalorian got praised for, but that series came out after this movie, so I guess that makes it kinda revolutionary, in terms of star wars movies. This is really cool. I like it. It's better than rise of skywalker so... One thing though: that L3 robot. I hated her, she comes up with the lamest jokes and serves no purpose in the story other than some weird ""love story""????",/review/rw4180105/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2018,SpoodermanDerp,6," Solo: A ""Skip This"" Story
","Gone is the time when an aloof and mysterious character like Han Solo can stand on his own. When the pure imagination of fans opened up countless debates on how the Kessel run really went down, or how Hans eventually won the Millennium Falcon and eventually became a staple of his character. The hard truth is, fans and casual viewers already knew these milestones in Han's story happened and will happen, so the only thing that mattered about this movie was, how was it going to happen?",/review/rw4180105/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2018,lastjosh,9," For anyone who feels discouraged by the reviews
","For anyone who feels discouraged by the reviews, I tell you this: They're not complaining about the movie, they're complaining because they feel abused by a continous stream of movies from a beloved franchise. It seems ironic, I know, but having nothing for so long and suddenly watching different posters every six months, has to be confusing and bound to raise some eyebrows. 
However, we have to look at it as objectively and simple as possible: If you love movies, you want to watch as many movies as you can. And if you love Star Wars, you love to experience the Star Wars' story! So all of this backlash for having so much of the thing you love is simply a tantrum that I hate to see on so many of my fellow Star Wars' fans.",/review/rw4180105/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2018,Kirpianuscus,," I am too old
","Each part of the new serie is , for me, new motif for understand I am too old for it. all seems be a pretext for new easy show. all is so, so superficial. and all was said, in smart way. so, maybe, just a new generation, ignoring the original serie, could be the target. the film has few virtues. but it has not a story. it reflect a decent effort for be the correct prequel of original story. but nothing seems coherent . or credible. or more than a sort of parody/ homage ( ? ) to western. sure, impressive images. fights, slices of humor, Chewbacca as savior of appearences and the end as gift. nice presence of Woody Harrelson. technology used in fine manner. but a Star Wars represents more. and the big problem, for a 42 years old , like me, is real simple: except Harrison Ford, nobody can be a reasonable Han Solo.",/review/rw4180105/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2018,zardoz-13,1," The Force Is Asleep in ""Solo""
","""Apollo 13"" director Ron Howard's ""Solo, A Star Wars Story"" qualifies as an exercise in trivial pursuit rather than a sensational space odyssey in the thriving ""Star Wars"" franchise. Unfortunately, this frivolous, uninspired potboiler pales by comparison with the best: ""Rogue One."" Mind you, ""The Force Awakens"" featured captivating characters with far more impressive pyrotechnics than ""Solo."" Happily, the second ""Star Wars Story"" is neither as bombastic nor as pretentious as the execrable ""Last Jedi."" Unfortunately, ""Solo"" suffers from the problems afflicting prequels. Since we know none of the franchise leads--Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Lando Calrissian--can die, the filmmakers generate only half as much suspense. The ill-fated characters that perish exert little impact in the greater context of events. Apart from prequel-itis, ""Empire Strikes Back"" scenarist Lawrence Kasdan and son Jonathan squander more time on penny-ante trivia about the eponymous character instead of fashioning a genuine, white-knuckled, escapade that might have propelled the franchise to greater heights. A mediocre B-movie, ""Solo"" is a routine crime thriller set among the stars. The best scene involves an elaborate but nerve-racking, roller-coaster train heist on a prodigious mountainside. Everything else seems superficial. At least one scene resembled the dudgeon scene in ""Return of the Jedi."" The aerial combat scenes with the Tie Fighters attacking the Falcon conjure up fewer thrills than the initial stand-off in the original ""Star Wars."" Han's adversaries project minimal menace. They fold like accordions in our hero's hands. Worse, they don't die spectacular deaths. You'll neither find a diabolical Darth Vader nor an arrogant Orson Krennic lurking in the background. A campy gargantuan octopus in outer space with teeth makes the depiction of the Kessel Run appear ludicrous rather than legendary. 
 
Basically, ""Solo, A Star Wars Story"" amounts to a laundry list of trivia serving as dots to connect the humdrum plot. Evidently, the people at Lucasfilm, Walt Disney Features, Imagine Entertainment, and Allison Shearmur Productions thought that depriving the title character of any shred of mystery would be indispensable for ""Star Wars"" aficionados. Why the Kasdans couldn't have made Han Solo into a livelier fellow still eludes me. ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" never really gets under Han's skin, and the script seems intent on filling in the blanks of the Harrison Ford character as reincarnated by a different actor. Han Solo's younger version (Alden Ehrenreich of ""Heil, Caesar"") bears little resemblance to his lanky predecessor. Appropriately, he is an optimistic soul who hasn't attained the wisdom that years of hardship would later impart. Strutting about like Billy the Kid, Ehrenreich smiles too often to be taken seriously. Of course, everybody is bound to appreciate the irony when he utters the line: ""I've got a good feeling about this."" If the film establishes anything, it is Han's naivety. He spends the entire movie fooling himself that he isn't the good guy, even when his passing love interest observes that he isn't a good guy. Arguably, the most controversial aspect that ""Star Wars"" purists will clamor about concerns Han's precipitant action in the final showdown with Beckett. For years, Lucas waffled about Han's clash with Greedo in the Mos Eisley Cantina. After altering it for the 1997 Special Edition re-release of ""Star Wars,"" he turned around and changed it again no less than twice. This minutia is the single thing that distinguishes this otherwise the somnolent saga.
 
Nevertheless, the filmmakers address a number of questions any ""Star Wars"" fan would love to know. Indeed, we learn how Han acquired not only his surname, but also won the Millennium Falcon while gambling with duplicitous Lando Calrissian during a game of Sabacc. Furthermore, we learn the circumstances of Han's chance encounter in a prison cell with Chewbacca. While most of the film sticks to the original details that have been part and parcel of the ""Star Wars"" film franchise as well as the Extended Universe of the ""Star Wars"" spin-off novels, Howard and the Kasdans have altered those circumstances for dramatic purposes. Originally, Han had been an Empire officer who had intervened on behalf of Chewbacca while a fellow Empire officer was torturing the Wookie. In ""Solo,"" the two are thrown together unceremoniously as prisoners in an oubliette, a prison that can only be accessed by a trapdoor in the ceiling. Nowhere in the film do the filmmakers account for Han's ability to converse with Chewbacca in the Wookie's own language. An important character, Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson of ""Natural Born Killers""), exists as a mentor who recruits Han into the big league of crime. Beckett furnishes Han with his distinctive firearm, a blaster pistol with a scope on it. A career criminal who refuses to trust anybody, Beckett wields probably the greatest influence over our protagonist. Earlier, we were told about the oppressive ""Oliver Twist"" like conditions that governed his formative years as a juvenile delinquent on the ship-building planet Corellia. Later, the details of the Kessel Run are fleshed out, but the schlocky space octopus sabotages any thrills. Remember, you cannot have suspense when you already know the outcome. 
 
Apart from a tremendous train heist, ""Solo"" delivers little nail-biting, edge-of-the-seat, tension despite its lavish $250-million budget. When you consider how long ""Star Wars"" fans have awaited such an opportunity, it is hopelessly disheartening to have a film that winds up being such a superficial, sophomoric saga. The problems that Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy encountered after she fired original co-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller of ""The Lego Movie,"" replacing them with Oscar winning helmer Ron Howard, who restaged three-quarters of the movie, undoubtedly must have exacted a dire toll on the film. Moreover, ""Solo"" amounts to the least picturesque entry in the franchise with some of the drabbest cinematography. Entire scenes have been photographed in sepia, so that faces, costumes, uniforms, and technology appear washed out against shimmering white backgrounds. Indisputably, ""Solo, A Star Wars Story,"" lacks the force that made the classic ""Star Wars"" adventures entertaining.",/review/rw4180105/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2018,petra_ste,7," Shockingly ok
","Color me astonished that a Han Solo origin movie, in theory the most unnecessary thing ever, turns out to be... kind of fun?

24 May 2018,paulijcalderon,6," No happiness or anger - Just an average feeling in between
","""I have a really good feeling about this!"" That's the line that Han says in the trailer that's playing in the cinema before the movies. And I remember my friend leaning over to me and saying: ""I hate that he says that so much"". There's no denying that all of my friends felt that this movie was not needed, me included. But we got it nonetheless and I always wanna give every movie a chance. ""Star Wars"" has been a very meaningful and inspirational saga for me and my family since ever before I can even remember. When Disney took over I held out hope that the new adventures would give me some joy of revisiting these characters in this world that I love. Unfortunately, I have been feeling more and more let down about the whole situation. I'm not gonna get into it here because there's too much to discuss. And there's already plenty of people who have voiced their displeasure of the mishandling of this property. The fear of us getting a new SW film every year is that the specialness will fade away. That they no longer feel like the events they were and that SW becomes over-saturated. It's been talked to death on other platforms, I know. I'm gonna get to what I thought, since that's why you are reading. Well, I did my best to go in with no expectations. Just to be open with the whole ""expect the worst and hope for the best"" type thing. And yes, you feel the ""Star Warsy""-ness, but I couldn't help but to leave the cinema less happy than you should watching a SW movie. The action set-pieces, the references and the practical effects are appreciated. But the core of the story needed more.",/review/rw4180105/?ref_=tt_urv

There are a few deaths that nobody seems to even be bothered by after the fact. What? The dialogue is long winded and uninspired. The bad guy is zzz. The battle scenes are low budget and laughable.
