","After a family tragedy for the Blackledge family, grandparents George (Kevin Costner) and Margaret (Diane Lane) are left to bring up baby Jimmy (Bram and Otto Hornung) with mother/daughter-in-law Lorna (Kayli Carter). But a few years later, Lorna marries bad-un Donnie Weboy (Will Brittain) and disappears back to Donnie's hillbilly extended family in the wilds of North Dakota, led by the fearsome Blanche Weboy (Lesley Manville). Fearing for the child's wellbeing, Margaret drags retired Sheriff George on a dangerous journey to rescue the child.",/review/rw6624271/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2021,TxMike,," Not pretty and pleasant but grandparents stand up to an evil family.
","Both Costner and Lane are among our favorites, it is hard to find either of them in a bad or even lackluster role. Here they are a long time couple, he is a retired law enforcement professional. Set in the early 1960s, they live on a small horse ranch in Montana, they have a married adult son and a small grandson. In an unfortunate riding accident their son dies, the D. I. L. Remarries a couple of years later. Then the newlyweds leave town suddenly and without saying goodbye.",/review/rw6624271/?ref_=tt_urv

13 December 2020,jtindahouse,9," Great characters everywhere you look and the rest flows from there
","There was a point about a quarter of the way through 'Let Him Go' where I was questioning the protagonist's motives and whether they were entitled to be doing what they appeared to be trying to do. As if the film recognised this may be an issue with audiences, they then do an excellent job from that point onwards of justifying their actions. The characters created in this film on both sides of the ledger are excellent. The heroes are people we can genuinely root for and care about their fate, and the villains are truly horrendous people who we want to meet the worst fate.",/review/rw6624271/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2021,valleyjohn,7," The new Straw Dogs ?
","Back in the 80's and 90's Kevin Costner was one of the biggest movie stars on the planet . He starred in some brilliant ( if not long ) movies but for some reason started to get a negative reputation and I'm not quite sure why . Perhaps Waterworld is to blame ? . Watching Let Him Ho you can see the man is still a very good actor but in this , he is outshone by two women.",/review/rw6624271/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2020,refordgarry,7," Uncomfortable Western
","Like many I'm a BIG Costner fan. This one could easily have been a rugged but amiable Western drama, but, like the moth flying close to the flame it gets tinged by inflexions of horror - a disquieting experience for the unwary. The plot has at its center the 'kidnap by marriage' of aged Margaret and George's grandson, goaded on by another interestingly psychotic family of near in-laws, resembling to no small degree the Snell Family of Netflix's 'Ozark', though this time featuring North Dakota as that bastion of redneck eccentricity. On the good side, it's a terrifyingly real situation, acted out charmingly by Kevin Costner with his trademark reserve. But the movie was a little long, with those now clich√©d tropes, the sort that better directors do well to avoid.",/review/rw6624271/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2020,ferguson-6,6," a stellar first two-thirds
","Greetings again from the darkness. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner reunite on screen, only this time it's not as the earthy and earthly parents to Superman (MAN OF STEEL, 2013). Instead, this film from writer-director Thomas Bezucha (THE FAMILY STONE, 2005), based on Larry Watson's 2013 novel, features the two stars as long-time married couple, Margaret and George Blackledge, living a peaceful existence on their Montana ranch. Well, it's peaceful now, as George is retired from his career as a lawman.",/review/rw6624271/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2020,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," Slower than tumbleweed rolling over prairie coal molasses
","Great casting, cinematography, sets and location, but novice writer and director Thomas Bezucha made this one a very unnecessarily slow burner. The 113 runtime was way too long for this story, and felt twice as long with the slow pacing, long dragged out scenes and unnecessary still shots. If you watched this at 1.2x speed, it'd be bearable. The screenplay needed a good 20-30 mins edited/cut out. The sound/score could've also been better. Not sure if it was Costner's character, or he was bored during filming, because this wasn't one of his finest performances - by a long shot. Never mind all the bogus 9's and 10's, this is an honest and very generous 6/10 from me.",/review/rw6624271/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2020,jdesando,," An modern gothic western set in the 50's with top performances.
",Let Him Go is a western-gothic crime thriller with a North Western setting and some resemblance to vintage oaters like The Searchers.

3 November 2021,mycannonball,8," Gritty, heartfelt crime drama
","This story is dark in many ways, but at the heart of it are two grieving grandparents (badass grandparents though) who want to save their toddler grandson from terrible criminals. Complex and thoughtful, it's the perfect mix of drama and suspense. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are amazing. This is a finely drawn drama with high stakes tension.",/review/rw6624271/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2020,bastille-852-731547,7," Taut, generally satisfying Western drama-thriller
","This new Western blends elements of noir, drama, and suspense to create a generally searing character study. Set in the 1960s, it tells the story of a retired sheriff (Kevin Costner) and his wife (Diane Lane.) Their young grandson has been spending time with his stepfather, whom they view as suspicious and is married to their son's widow. The leading couple leaves from Montana to the Dakotas to visit their step-family and try to get their grandson back, but things go south very quickly. The performances are generally powerful all around. Costner and Lane give clear emotional depth as well as a real sense of genuineness and urgency while in character. They feel haunted with grief from the death of their son, yet also proactively driven by a strong desire to ensure their grandson is properly treated. The film's cinematography of the Great Plains is gorgeous (although it was actually filmed in Alberta, Canada,) and the score is also quietly powerful.",/review/rw6624271/?ref_=tt_urv

30 November 2020,A_Different_Drummer,6," Ultimately a movie you would never want to see or recommend
","Let's be crystal clear. Costner and Lane are so professional and interesting by themselves you could watch them build a garage and still be entertained. But movies have to more than the sum of their parts. Here Thomas Bezucha has written an abomination of a script where the real ""mystery"" -- why the girl married poorly in the first place -- takes place outside the narrative and off-camera almost before the opening titles. In these kinds of melodramas, there are usually story beats developed early on so, that when the climax comes, the audience is tuned in and feels satisfied. Bezucha doesn't care about his audience at all. He tells the story, it seems, to suit only himself. Just like the main villain that he created.",/review/rw6624271/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2020,Xavier_Stone,5," Not entirely terrible, just something to pass the time
",Kevin and Diane make a good movie couple and they go good together in this western drama set in the 60's. I wouldn't say this is a thriller as almost all the scenes are predictable once they start and the pace is quite slow. The scenery is a nice touch for people who haven't seen the Alberta/Montana area but it's not a reason to watch this.,/review/rw6624271/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2020,wisemanfromtowne,3," Overrated reviews made me want to watch this MEH film.
","Dont believe the hype reviews about this MEH film. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner played the roles of two grandparents you just wanted slap and ask, WTF were you thinking? The story line was weak, the build up was off and the ending was ridiculous. The best part of the film was the score. I'm not sure what these other reviews are even talking about, especially saying Lane deserves and Oscar for this role....huh? Overrated reviews made me want to watch this MEH film.

",If you're a parent or grandparent this movie will touch a few nerves. The character development of our main characters are well written with an outstanding performance by Costner and Lane. However I feel like I needed to know more about our antagonists which were poorly written for the movie. It was difficult to understand the motives behind their actions and their drive to push back against our protagonists (without saying too much). Lots of questions left behind at the end but otherwise an enjoyable movie.,/review/rw6624271/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2021,kevin_robbins,9," This movie was very well written, acted and put together. I strongly recommend this film.
","Let Him Go (2020) is a movie we recently watched on a Delta flight on the way to a wedding. The storyline focuses on recent grandparents who lose their son in an unfortunate accident and their widowed daughter in-law marries an abusive man and then mysteriously moves away. When they believe their former daughter in-law and grandson are being abused they set out on a mission to rescue them. This movie is directed by Thomas Bezucha (Monte Carlo) and stars Kevin Costner (Dances with Wolves), Diane Lane (The Outsiders), Kayli Carter (Bad Education) and Greg Lawson (Heartland). The storyline for this is delivered in an outstanding and methodical manner. The cinematography of the landscape, each characters tragic past, how the grandparents fit together and appreciate each other, and how they work together (or don't) to accomplish their ultimate goals for the benefit of the family was wonderful. This movie was very well written, acted and put together. I strongly recommend this film and would score it a solid 9/10.",/review/rw6624271/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2020,TheAnimalMother,8," Somehow, Cherry Valance Is Still Hot
","This is a strong film and a special one I'd say. How unusually unsatisfyingly it unravels, but yet you still totally want to see what happens next. The film is authentic feeling enough to really drag you into it, whether you like where it's going or not. I think for most mature audiences, it will affect them in this way for the most part. Thankfully this is not just another predictable Hollywood film. It certainly isn't unfamiliar territory, not at all, but it's certainly far more uncompromising and the characters are more realistic than most modern Hollywood films; And therefore the film is a breath of fresh air on this basis alone, even though the movies atmosphere is somewhat stifling. It seemed to me that this role was absolutely perfect for Diane Lane at this stage in her career/life. Or is it that she just totally embodied the character and nailed it? Definitely both! In my view anyway. And the Oscar goes to...if I was handing them out. She was amazing in this. I would even venture to say one of the better female performances I've seen out of Hollywood in the last many years. She was that good, and the part was also a pretty interesting one. Subtle and intense I think describe her performance the most accurately. Costner was definitely very understated and subtle himself in another very strong performance. My advice to those with mature viewing eyes, don't miss this film!",/review/rw6624271/?ref_=tt_urv

","After losing their son, retired sheriff George(Kevin Costner) and his wife Margaret(Diane Lane) leave their Montana ranch to rescue their young grandson from the clutches of a dangerous family after their daughter in law remarriage. Diane lane and Kevin Costner play well Off each other. This being their third time working together the past seven years you can start to see that old married couple image with them. The first hour of the movie seems to drag for a bit . But once they find their grandson the movie picks up real quick.",/review/rw6624271/?ref_=tt_urv
