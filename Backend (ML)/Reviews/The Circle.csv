14 January 2020,mrazovabarbora,8," So addictive...
","Can't stop watching...its really good. Also, is it just me or the Alex/Adam guy looks and sounds like Steve Carrell?!!! Almost like one of his movie characters ðŸ˜‚",/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2020,viggodahlin,8," Shubham is my favorite.
","The Circle is an addictive, fake and entertaining tv series on netflix. This is in my opinion the kind of tv series you would watch if you have nothing else to watch and all of a sudden you love it. I know i do. Some moments in the series it can be a little bit too fake when for example everybody loves Sean for literally no reason. But in the end you want to watch more and it's a great and chill tv show to watch. An 8.3/10 from me.",/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2020,cocol2,9," Totally shocked me how good it is
","Omg! I thought this show would be vapid and lame and annoying etc.
BUT the cast of Season One have totally won my heart. This ended up being a sweet, somewhat intelligent and completely hilarious and awesome show.
I am NOT in to reality TV whatsoever but this show hooked me.
I am curious to see if the tone changes in following seasons but it def came out swinging.
Hopefully the recipe isn't dependent on Chris, Joey, Sammie, 'Rebecca', or Shooby to bring the specialness.",/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2020,davidm-14,8," a new iteration of reality tv
","Stumbled across this new reality show (new for the US anyway, and only 4 episodes to start) on netflix. it's an interesting take on reality tv in general, and on people's need to use social media specifically. it's apparently taken from a successful similar show in the UK, where people are placed in apartments within the same building and can only interact via some cleverly set-up ""internet"" screens (they can only interact with each other). some big personalities immediately stand out.",/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2020,itsactuallyamanda,8," It's Basically Big Brother, But for Popular People, But It's Fun.
","The Circle is an unique and interesting original series from Netflix that gives the Big Brother vibe but instead of it being a game with ordinary people, we are treated with contestants who are or who have an social media following (and yes, I did my research on the contestant Instagram profiles) which I mean, it gives the show a little bit of that unique factor to it that makes it fun and exciting to watch. I do like the idea that the cast itself is diverse and have many different personalities where they can choose who they want to be which makes it so fun and overall, if you want a reality show that is different and a show where the contestants never come face to face with each other, then The Circle is one to watch.",/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2020,twilso-29868,9," You think you would hate it
","It has all the characteristics of being trash but is actually hilarious. Give it a watch, after the first episode you won't be disappointed",/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2020,breemartell,9," Addictive!
",I just found this on Netflix and didn't realize it was a weekly show. I ended up binging all the episodes they had out and finding myself on the edge of my seat! I am so excited for the next episode! It's like if black mirror made a reality show. I absolutely love it!,/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2021,lineart-12973,," Narcissism at its best
","If that's your thing, along with the usual fake personalities, exaggerating, even lying, these egotistical, insecure wannabees do it best. What is the point?",/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2020,jmwrate,8," Why is this the best thing ever?
",I normally tend to not like reality tv shows but when I started watching this show it was unlike anything I had seen before. i fell in love with all the players and loved how the game worked. if there was a possibility I could participate i would. I was always waiting for the next episode to air. overall it's a great show to watch and i would recommend it to everyone even if your not a reality buff. #Sammie&Shooby,/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2020,karaq,1," How do people find this addictive?
","Are we really so bored as a society that we find this entertaining and addictive? People sitting around talking to a screen, pretending to be or not pretending, who really cares? ""I am who I am"" lol that's a statement about Gen Z. They can be so fake online and be so different in reality. Here's a concept, get off the computer and go meet people face to face! This whole concept is so contrived and fake! What a snooze fest!",/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2021,garnet-suss,3," Trash
","If you like shows like Big Brother that bring out the worst in people, and if you care at all about social media personalities, then you'll like this show.",/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2020,Healing_Process,5," Cringey and Extremely fake.
","The show itself is in a way enticing. You always want to see people meet face to face and you want to see who wins the $100,000 . But the ride to get there is a long, cringey, pandering, hyper edited and staged journey.",/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2021,malesh-esm7,7," Love 1st season only
",First season was really good natural beautiful people but season 2 is full of drama and real evil people I don't like season 2 it lowered the rate for me.,/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2020,BrettLee20,10," Big Brother meets Catfish/Tinder
","If you love Big Brother or any reality tv show really, you'll love this! It's so much fun to watch. It's Big Brother but the cast is separated, never seeing each other, only texting on a dating style app which is on their tv, is the best way to explain it... you get to see only one photo of them to start... are they who they say they are or are they a catfish? I feel more connected with this cast than any other tv show, some of the catfish will even make you cry bc they don't think they're good enough to be themselves... but they definitely are.",/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2021,yellowbubblegum,4," Loved the 1st season, hated the 2nd
","US reality tv producers, why on earth you have to ruin everything?! I loved the sincerity of the 1st season, it seemed actual, real: all the convos there, relationships, tears, everything. I'm saying that despite my fave didn't win lol
However, the 2nd season, just what the heck!!",/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2022,amethystjdhd,2," It had three really fun seasons but the fourth got so boring
","Is it the casting now that makes it so lackluster?..or the formula just seems tired? The original Circle had a fun, interesting and attractive American cast, then came Season 2 with a cast of colorful Brazilians, each with their own distinct personality and after that also fashionable and diverse French speakers for Season 3. In contrast Season 4, could be classified as the US ""regular folks"" cast, which seems to feature quirkiness but very boring quirkiness. It was moderately entertaining until the 9th episode when I found myself turning it off out of sheer boredom. I mean why watch when you don't care who gets eliminated? Then I tried it again, wondered why I was watching it and logged out after a short time. The next day I got to the part when Carol describes her trip to Italy, whatever..... The discussion and laughter which ensued over some photo of her was BORING and not funny.... I turned the show off again. Will I return to see who wins? Who knows? Who cares?",/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2022,PalmBeachG,7," Addictive But Each Season Basically The Same
",Watched all 4 Seasons now and I keep watching for some reason - it is addictive however each season is basically the same and getting kind of boring now after 4 Seasons. The players are picked to represent a certain kind of character each season the same. Seems we always have the same types playing and catfishing. This Season 4 was so predictable from the beginning who the winner was going to be but for some reason ou still want to see the show anyway. If they have a Season 5 I think they need to switch it up a bit.,/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2020,lme30122-279-665067,10," Awesome!
",Really binge watching show. I loved joey miranda shubby sammie and chris. Im glad joey won but sad that chris didnt. This show gave me faith there is still good people left in this world,/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2020,gallagherkellie,3," So boring
",More boring than Big Brother. It's just people sitting alone in a room typing messages to each other. I stopped after one episode.,/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2020,EpimetheusA1,9," Hooked
",I usually don't indulge in reality television because of its absurdity but I haven't been able to stop watching. The concept is so simple that you think this show wouldn't be any good but I find this show both hilarious and heartfelt. I am tempted to call this a guilty pleasure but honestly this show isn't bad at all. Might be a preacher to the choir when I say that I love the diversity of this show. Plus I love a good competition.,/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2020,freidap,7," Nice concept, improvements needed
","I really enjoyed the premise of the show, and did feel the urge to continue watching. The contestants were well-selected overall, providing a good mix of personalities.",/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2021,mhforever-62280,8," Good show funny sometimes but...
",Great show however it's main struggle is with the contestants eight times out of 10 they have the personality of a rock. Which makes it at the end of the season a bit cringe worthy and unwatchable. They need contestant with fun personality. And please take note being gay is not a personality.,/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2020,jcurran-66319,9," Unexpectedly great
","So I saw the trailer for this and I thought ""look at the garbage Netflix is picking up nowadays, these fools are desperate for content"" but for reasons I'll never understand I put it on anyway. I never thought I'd get so invested in a show like this. I'm not too big into reality TV but now I'm texting all my friends like ""watch The Circle so I can have someone to talk about this with! Trust me it's amazing!"" Don't ask questions, just get past the first 15 minutes (lotta cringe) and bask in the glory of The Circle",/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2021,a-gordon-2374,1," I don't get it
","I really don't understand how people find this entertaining. A few episodes in and I'm bored out of my mind. Reality TV is usually overproduced, heavily scripted, fake, and generally embarrassing, but at least sometimes it can be good junk to binge on when you're really bored.",/review/rw6824401/?ref_=tt_urv
