13 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,8," Pretty Good Sci-fi Series!
",I've been putting off watching Foundation ever since it first came out but now that I've seen it I can say I really enjoyed it. I never read the books so I can't say how close this is to them but I wouldn't care either way as long as it's a good show. It may start a little slow for some but that's because they do such an excellent job at building their world and characters but it does pick up. The CGI is absolutely amazing as this is one of the most beautifully shot shows I've ever seen. It really is a pretty solid sci-fi series and I'm glad I finally watched it. They have me hooked now and I can't wait for season 2.,/review/rw8756744/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2021,gaspyy,6," Disappointed
","While I love the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov(and the Empire and Robots series), I admit it may be a bit dated. The novels were written during the '50s and Asimov never described the visuals in detail.",/review/rw8756744/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2021,dwarol,6," It should never have been a Foundation adaptation
","There's nothing wrong with ""Foundation"" as a SF series. But the showrunner's (David S. Goyer) big mistake was trying to adapt Asimov's Foundation trilogy. He just doesn't understand it.",/review/rw8756744/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2022,alrv63,8," Good but the usual childish elements
","I don't know how much this diverges from the original Foundation story - quite a lot in places I believe. However, coming to it without that subjective view (and I totally get it) the story within this adaptation is in many ways epic. The visuals are fantastic and the actors, characters and overall ""feel"" is immersive. All of that said it is let down by the usual ""Hollywood"" (though it is not) childishness when it comes to the portrayal of some details. For example - the classic ""stormtrooper"" shootouts. One or two of our ""heroes"" versus a lot of ""highly trained"" troops in a shootout. Guess what? Our heroes are impossible to hit. Meanwhile they (barely) skulk behind some small flimsy cover and pick off opponent after opponent. Crap. Other things like spaceships in the middle of loads of asteroids - really!? Doubtless someone will say ""oh they've got shields blah blah"". Nope - it's someone saying ""visually it looks cool - don't worry about the details"". So - story, acting, visuals - really good. Some of the childish staged bits - less good and a lazy shame.",/review/rw8756744/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2022,Woozywoowoo,9," Visually stunning
","This is visually stunning. I actually rewatched several parts just because of the amazing CGI. The actors so far are really good and relatable. The story itself is a really really good premise, it makes total sense that there could be an equation that can predict the future. I am very excited to see where they take the show. I actually watched a few episodes more than once which is a lot for me cause for tv shows it's usually one and done. After watching this I started to look into the original books. I really hope more people watch and enjoy this, if I had one complaint I would say sometimes things are a little slow and I would like more action. Other than that it's a banger syfy.",/review/rw8756744/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2021,johannes2000-1,9," Spectacular scifi, that also moves the soul.
","I recently saw the new ""Dune"" movie, and it's tempting to compare the two, since they're both based on an epic story in the far away future, with a colonized universe, a central relentless empire and rebellious subjects, and both use spectacular visual means to create their world. Of course it's not entirely fair, because ""Foundation"" has over 10 hours to tell their story. But the biggest difference is, that in ""Dune"" the visuals and the (complicated) story totally dominate the rather soul-less characters, while in ""Foundation"" is it especially the personal development of the characters that forms the main focus of the story.",/review/rw8756744/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2021,michalklebs,6," Not a Foundation
","So far it has very little to do with its source material... It is barely ""inspired"" by Asimov novels, definitely not based on them. It has ambition to be a new Game of Thrones in space, but it is not as epic nor as intelligent. Good production value but it focuses on random stuff. A shame...",/review/rw8756744/?ref_=tt_urv

24 September 2021,adrian-458,3," A Difficult Thing to Review...
","Cards on the table: I've been reading Asimov since I can remember and that was a very long time ago! I'm intimately acquainted with his science fiction writing and can quote passages verbatim. So when I heard that 'Foundation' was going to be made into a TV series, I was filled with dread. This only got worse when I heard who the directors/producers/writers were.",/review/rw8756744/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2021,nancyldraper,8," Really Well Done
","If you are familiar with the Isaac Asminov's books, you can understand why his FOUNDATION series has not found its way into mainstream media before now. It began as a series of short stories in a magazine (so it doesn't have a core of characters), it covers a vast expanse of time (so it is problematic in gathering an invested audience) and it is rather dated (the trilogy being written in the 1950s and the other 7 books spawned by a renewed interest in the 80s. However, it is arguably one of the most influential SciFi works (Does Dynastic Galactic Empires ring any bells for you? DUNE? STAR WARS?). Showrunner David S Goyer has proposed an 8 season arc for this fledgling project and if season one is any indication, this series has legs. It is beautiful, it is grand in tone, it gives us a core group of characters that span the massive time line, it has a talented cast giving layered performances and it has already been renewed by Apple TV+ For a second season. Without hesitation, I give this series an 8 (really well done) out of 10. {Epic SciFi}",/review/rw8756744/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2023,raimondtunnel-46087,8," Amazing sci-fi series
","This show for me is a little bit of The Expanse, Stargate, Star Trek: Discovery, Event Horizon, and other great and enjoyable sci-fi series. However, it's even beyond these shows in some regards. It never ceased to amaze me. There are spaceships, megastructures, space mysteries, different cultures and beliefs on different planets, memorable and relatable characters, tough choices, lots of emotions etc. The actors and visuals were all great.",/review/rw8756744/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2022,Thorgal67,10," Excellent Sci-Fi series (review of Season 1)
","Let's make it clear: I have never read the books by Asimov on which this series is based, and I do not care if in 50's this character was male or that character was white.",/review/rw8756744/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2022,andrew-york80,8," Great Sci-Fi but it's not true to Asimov's writings
","Watched as far as Episode 8 and I have to day that I'm really enjoying the series so far. The overtly WOKE approach to the characters is disappointing but they are still believable and the multiple storylines of Empire, Terminus, Seldon are engaging and entertaining despite not following the books. The visuals and effects are great and it's clear that the production values are quite high.",/review/rw8756744/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2021,translate2010,7," Waited for so long-disappointed so far
","They have some of the best SciFi source for this series. Asimov dedicated so many novels to tell this story, but somehow the makers of this show felt that wasn't enough so they added content that has nothing to do with Asimov's novels. What a shame, after waiting decades for someone to do Foundation justice.",/review/rw8756744/?ref_=tt_urv

31 January 2023,musickrev,7," Good sci-fi yarn
","Entertaining sci-fi story that bears only a marginal relationship to the Asimov books, for better or worse. Many decades ago I heard a BBC Radio 4 radio dramatisation that hewed much more closely to the source and it was very effective, but it had the enormous advantage of using the listener's imagination to fill in the visual effects. Here we have a nicely done creation that integrates a believable vision of Asimov's world with a whole series of plot changes, subtractions and additions. All done to create an action show out of what can read more than anything else as a series of historical drama books. So some of the mileage you are going to get out of this series depends on your familiarity with the Asimov story, and I suspect those without will enjoy this more. Especially if you are deeply sympathetic to Asimov's concept. For me, this was disappointing but I was able to put this aside because overall it is an effective conception designed to play to the strengths of a TV series. To its credit it does incorporate some of the most important ideas introduced by Asimov even it takes them in diverging directions. Overall the dialogue and acting are reasonably good, even if the direction tends to drag from time to time. The largely unnecessary sex scenes are chaste by recent standards. On its own terms, perfectly enjoyable if not exactly a sc-fi classic.",/review/rw8756744/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2021,crsunblast,5," Not the Foundation
","This is yet another example of someone borrowing a title and character names from one story and making up a completely different story using those names. This show bears very little resemblance to the Asimov books, so if that's what you're expecting, you will be disappointed.",/review/rw8756744/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2022,allen_pagent,10," A great sci-fi effort
","Transforming classic science fiction books to the screen is quite a task. Foundation, a mega classic, would certainly be a challenge for anyone. If you've read the series you need to approach this with a clean slate. I think the people at Apple did a fantastic job bringing the spirit and message of Foundation to the screen. The cast is great. Lee Pace is perfect for this series. If you haven't seen him in ""Halt And Catch Fire"", look for it. Jared Harris, another solid actor, was a great choice for Hari Seldon. Over all, the entire cast did a great job. I'm really looking forward to season 2. I'm glad Apple TV decided to take on this project.",/review/rw8756744/?ref_=tt_urv

24 October 2021,DangerousDag,1," Why would the producers bother making a show based on books that they clearly haven't read?
","I was prepared to give this show the benefit of the doubt, but watching this mess of a production just after watching the new Dune movie made the contrast so clear to me that I can no longer offer any sympathy or find any redeeming qualities that could earn Foundation a higher score than the lowest possible rating.",/review/rw8756744/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2022,habdelwahed-190-665640,8," Very good show but the books still better
",I watched the TV show which I liked very much. Then I did my homework and knew who is Isaac Asimov and read foundation books. Anyone who watches the show eill enjoy it but still The books are much better. The show took the broad lines of the books. But fall short of achieving the same quality of the books.
