2 October 2021,MovieWarfare,3," Enticing premise but terrible dialogue and writing ruin it
","M. Night Shyamalan is such a fascinating director, you never know what you're going to get with him. He has made some of the most memorable movies with the best twist in cinema history and he has made some of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's like a flip of a coin, the head is good and the tail is a bad movie situation. The premise of Old is ""A family on a tropical holiday who discover that the secluded beach where they are relaxing for a few hours is somehow causing them to age rapidly reducing their entire lives into a single day"". So does Old (2021) land on heads or tails?",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2021,CinemaClown,," Interesting Concept, Uninteresting Execution
","The latest madcap offering from the filmmaker who has made a career out of coming up with truly insane & ambitious ideas over the years (whether he is able to make them work or not in execution being a whole another debate), Old finds the (in)famous writer-director once again experimenting with a crazy concept but the end result is a mixed bag as the film fails to make the most of what was up for grabs.",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2021,arungeorge13,5," Shyamalan desperately needs the services of a dialogue-writer [+48%]
","I'll give it to Shyamalan for his innovative one-line ideas, some of which translate well onto the screen. Old boasts an original concept and sumptuous cinematography (by Mike Gioulakis), but the writing and performances fail to see it through. Once the ageing aspect is set in motion, the film loosens its grip on the viewers, eventually settling for a tame finale. The characters fail to connect due to their weak portrayals and artificial-sounding dialogue.",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2021,elliotjeory,6," I aged 2 hours watching this
","Good story, intriguing enough to keep your interest, kind of freaky and unintentionally funny in places. The actors were a bit random, it's a strange kind of film but it was ok. What's annoying is the lack of explanation to the cause so it loses points for that.",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2021,Sleepin_Dragon,7," An enjoyable movie.
","I have read several really bad reviews about this film, and the last film or two I watched from Shyamalan were average at best, but there was something about this film that I did enjoy.",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv

","Guy (Gael García Bernal) and his family have been given an exotic resort vacation. They and other guests are brought to a secluded closed beach. Soon, they realize that the kids are growing older by years and nobody can escape.",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2021,omendata,4," Amateur hour soon gets old...(after 10 mins)
","Dreadfully dull acting, story that soon becomes stale and is badly paced with a truly contrived ending replete with so many logical inconsistencies. M. Shyamalan produces yet another turkey (and its not even Christmas yet).",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2021,kjproulx,3," A Cool Concept that Goes Nowhere
","M. Night Shyamalan has been a director I have admired, but have only connected with a couple of times. Nearly every movie buff praises his film The Sixth Sense as his best, and rightfully so. It's definitely up there for me, but his grounded work with Unbreakable is truly his crown jewel to me. He then had his string of blockbusters like The Last Airbender, After Earth, and The Happening. This is when everyone began to realize his heydays were over. With that said, his return with The Visit, Split, and Glass were all very commendable. For that reason alone, I had some newfound excitement for his next project. Old is now playing in theatres and here are my honest thoughts on what is easily one of Shyamalan's worst films.",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2021,rmmil,3," Your character motivation? Stare blankly.
","Typical M. Night film, interesting concept with poor execution, poor writing/character motivations, and a few WTF absurd moments.",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2021,Neptune165,3," This movie has some of the worst acting i've ever seen from everyone honestly...
","Great atmosphere and setting. Dialogues are terrible in some scenes. Makes you wonder if Night rewrote them to deal with prior criticism. This movie is the definition of ""terrible"". Horrible and exasperating movie, Besides the kid actors and their older version,the actors were horrible. Terrible movie I got a headache I hated the spinning camera the ringing it was awful. I didn't really like the way it was filmed, it felt very slow when turning the camera and i wish they would have shown more. This had all the potential to be something very interesting an engaging. Yet, the acting, timing and some of the shots were absolutely atrocious. BTW, how did nobodies hair or finger nails grow! If this was a first time Director with a low budget and production constraints, then may have been less critical....however, given his reputation and budget this was inexcusable.",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,Leofwine_draca,4," Messy direction
","OLD (2021) is another M. Night Shyamalan film spoilt by his over the top direction. I love THE SIXTH SENSE and there are others in his filmography I like too, but he seems to miss more often than he hits. This one tells the story of a cursed beach that causes anyone who visits it to age rapidly, and it's a neat premise that would have worked well in an episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE or somesuch. But in Shyamalan's hands this is a mess, with awkward and stilted performances, too many uninteresting characters standing around and chatting or just doing nothing, and a ""twist"" ending only included because the running time comes up short. As for the ""inventive"", anything-goes camerawork...give me a break!",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2021,statuskuo,6," The Anxiety Of Aging
","For those of you who claim to blink one day and your whole life is behind you, this movie may give you major anxiety. The story is of a mysterious island where certain visitors are chosen and carted off to a special place where you age quickly. By quickly the math turns out to be 3 hours would equal 10 years. Having discovered this phenomenon too late the ""castaways"" soon become desperate in trying to find the escape path. If there is one.",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2022,BA_Harrison,4," You might find yourself wishing away the time watching this one.
","M. Night Shyalaman's directorial career skyrocketed with The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, but the majority of his subsequent movies have failed to match the impact of those two films. His 'Twilight Zone'-style storytelling got old really quick.",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2021,ben-mckimm,1," Insulting
","The camera angles, the acting, the story, the directing, the writing, the effects... Completely insulting, to the point where I genuinely feel like it would be an enormous effort to make something this bad. It felt like a joke.

28 July 2021,bob-the-movie-man,6," Dafter than the Dharma initiative.
","""Old"" is the latest from the gloriously inconsistent writer/director M. Night Shyamalan. Will this be great Shyamalan (à la ""The Sixth Sense"") or dire Shyamalan (à la ""The Last Airbender"")? The answer, in my view, is somewhere in the middle. It's a curate's egg of a movie.",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2021,AdrenalinDragon,2," What the hell M. Night?
","Is Old a Comedy? Am I supposed to take this seriously? The performances are usually either weird or terrible, and it has some of the worst dialogue and line delivery I've ever heard. None of the Aging gimmick makes sense and just ends up delivering unintentionally funny moments. There's no good reason to care about any character here. It's all done so poorly.",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv

","... and select every film you watch accordingly. Because you never know when you might get the chance to visit Fantasy Island (not the one in Skegness) and live your life like Ben Button, but a bit faster and in reverse.

","Watching Shyamalan movies is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. Although I like the trailer of this movie, the movie was very bad, friends. The script and dialogues of the movie were very bad and stupid. I think the casting was good, but they didn't show good acting performances because it was a bad script.",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2021,Her-Excellency,1," Move Over Gigli and Battlefield Earth
","Move Over Gigli and Battlefield Earth; your reign as worst movies ever, has finally come to an end with the twisted (not in a good way), ridiculously-scripted, boring/yawn-inducing, cringy, jaw-droppingly-bad ""Old"" from never-again-to-be heard-of director, M. Night Shyamalan.",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2021,mrjeffmoore,4," Interesting premise, poorly executed.
","This movie will definitely be polarizing. I find myself on the ""meh"" side of this movie. It was interesting and somewhat original, but as it progressed I found myself giggling and sometimes donwright laughing instead of feeling scared or intrigued in any way. I'm not sure if he intended this movie to be funny, but some of it was just silly. Some of the acting was pretty bad and over the top, and the ending was a huge letdown. It was not horrible, but I wouldn't watch it again. I mean, I've even rewathed The Village and Signs, and lots of people hated those. This one is definitely a one and done.",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv

2 August 2021,kosmasp,7," Help me, help ... others
","It's funny that I read so much about a ""return"" of M. Night .. I thought his last movie had that covered. But then again, that was a few years ago, so maybe some already forgotten about that or he vanished again for them.",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2021,cmantafounis,3," Old
","One of M. Night's most accomplished films visually, even if the shots are mostly vacuous and made irrelevant by the stupidity of the script. The dialogue here is atrocious, whether laughably on-the-nose (""I can't wait to hear it when you're older"") or just blatantly unnatural (""I'm sorry you were on this beach, but this is my family."" ""I'm not a forensic pathologist, but..."" ""I curate exhibits for museums. I'm telling you this because I want you to trust me..."" ""No, I don't know, man. Maybe it was butterfly stroke. I don't watch the Summer Olympics like that."" ""The dog has died!"" / ""Oh, my God. He was only just alive."" and so forth). Given the material, the uniformly awful performances are hard to blame on the actors, though there are still some stand-outs, Vicky Krieps (Phantom Thread) in particular being surprisingly terrible. All the setups are painfully obvious: the free cocktails, the seizure, ""You don't want to be hunched when you grow up"", the entire opening scene and its constant references to the future and ageing; the payoffs are not much better. Any attempts at horror are ruined by the confused tone, in that the comically bad elements diminish the possibility of sustained tension. Occasionally a psychological horror is tapped into, with the premise naturally providing ample opportunity to consider themes of growing old, health, experiences and memories, but these ideas are presented clumsily, and any success is retroactively neutered by a final twist that serves no purpose other than to surprise the audience (which, of course it does, as who could see something so illogical coming?). In fact, its inclusion takes away from the previous hour-and-a-half, by reframing the narrative to be about *spoiler* rather than the concept of people ageing while stuck in time, gradually dying without the chance to ever live. Hard to understate how idiotic the final fifteen minutes are - this makes for an exemplary case as to why a twist is not inherently compelling. Luckily the main movie is too weak to be at all ""ruined"" by its ending, already suffering from stilted dialogue, poor performances, nonsensical plot-beats, and lame body horror regardless. Shyamalan films the heck out of that beach, though.",/review/rw7477681/?ref_=tt_urv
