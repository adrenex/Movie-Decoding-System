26 July 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,10," A show that proves TV dramas can beat movies any day.
","As a Morse addict I was sceptical about a prequel, prequels are very much in vogue, not always successful, the likes of Prime Suspect flopped, but Endeavour has continued to exceed my expectations. The devastation I felt when Morse went, then Poirot, then finally Foyle's War was pretty big, three of the best shows from the last twenty years in my opinion, but Endeavour has taken the mantle.",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2015,TheLittleSongbird,9," A more than worthy, and almost as good, prequel series to Inspector Morse
","Not just a more than worthy prequel series to one of my favourite detective dramas of all time and goes very well with it, but it is a great series on its own as well, one that got off to a good start, though some of the pilot and the first episode had a still-finding-its-feet-feel (understandably), and just keeps getting stronger. It maintains everything that makes Inspector Morse so good, while also containing enough to make it its own.",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2017,maria-ricci-1983,9," Fantastic and surprising in the good sense, despite my initial doubts as a Morse's fan
","I deeply love Morse's series, and I deeply love Lewis sequel, each in its own different way. They are two extraordinary detective shows, which I strongly recommend.",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2013,phantom_fan89,10," Great entertainment that deserves to be judged by its own merits
","Considering that detective procedurals populate the British television landscape perhaps more than any other genre, one might lament at the prospect of not only another crime drama, but a prequel to one of the most beloved shows, mystery or otherwise, to ever grace the small screen, Inspector Morse. Those who might dismiss Endeavour as just another generic addition to an already overcrowded marketplace, however, would be making a grievous error.",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2015,kikkapi20,9," Stellar TV
","High quality television, with its strength being the re-creation of the 1960s, but with 2010s cinematic advances. The main characters are interesting and well-acted, although if you are a steady mystery viewer, you will figure out the ending very soon, which does take away from the suspense.",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2013,chasfrost,10," Endeavour Magic
","Well I have just watched the second episode in the new series and was captivated again. As soon as I had finished watching I watched it again taking in all the things I had missed the first time, I have my dictionary/computer on hand to research some of the phrases and words which adds to the enjoyment. I do not listen to opera or classical music but yearn to know what the wonderful soundtrack comprises of. The characters and relationship of Morse and Thursday is captivating. This is British TV drama at its very best. I just hope it is kept real and Oxford does not become more infamous than 'Denton Woods'! The props and vehicles used during the show are amazing and really create a super feeling for the time.",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2017,bobbobwhite,9," The very best of PBS
","Typically great PBS Mystery, but much better than most. Shaun Evans as Endeavour Morse, with his childlike deer in the headlights look as he detects each weekly crime, portrays the young but already very cerebral Morse whom we remember so well as an elder copper from the great 90s PBS show. Evans' as Morse, with his deceptive appearance of innocence and naivete, works through crimes with gentle but bulldog persistence until all is sorted. Roger Allam as his stoic, staid, habit-bound chief detective is also superb in his unwavering, fatherly support of Morse throughout, is always 100% credible as a mid-level Brit copper. Anton Lesser plays his daft martinet of a superintendent as not totally stupid, but he is perfectly underwhelming on purpose as Supt. Bright(hmmm)and is much more consumed with political kissing up than he is with the drudgery of everyday police work. He leaves that to the minions. All in all, great ensemble work, with very individual and unique characterizations in all roles, and I must say that I am so pleased that PBS has not fallen into the common American TV crime show trap of extending one crime into seeming infinity, week after slogging week. Thanks to this Morse, all is saved, and solved, in each show. The gorgeous and dramatic theme and various opera and classical pieces play a significant qualitative part too, as they both did in the original Morse show. Anticipate, then enjoy.",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2013,mb-155,9," Charming drama
","Love this drama. Like the whole idea of a young Morse. Endeavour certainly has his detractors which have the scope to needle him because he is so junior. I suppose this is why he is so grumpy when he is older - getting his own back as it were. So plenty here to allow viewers to hark back to the original drama but also a huge amount of good coming from the new actors. From the use of typewriters to seeing lots of letters. A lack of overt violence, sex and swearing plus excellent story lines. What more can we ask?",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2018,grandmabrat,10," Liked Morse but I really love Endeavour.
","Inspector Morse was just about the best show on tv but I love Endeavour even more. The character is like Morse but younger, a little bit naive and learning his way around. The ability to see through mysteries is just as good but more characters in the show gives you a better look at the character of Endeavour Morse. I could watch this show every week, if only they could produce them that fast.",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2015,BeneCumb,9," Surprisingly meaty and captivating British crime series
","/refers to series 1 and 2/ Well, I have always been fond of British crime films, including Inspector Morse and Lewis, but usually I am not into prequels or something new created by virtue of popularity wave... But Endeavour captivated me from the very beginning: solid and distinct performances (particularly Shaun Evans as Endeavour Morse and Roger Allam as Fred Thursday, but also most in minor roles), wise and learned Oxford atmosphere, realistic overview of life in Britain in the 1960ies - to name a few...",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2017,edwinvanboekel,10," Every episode an evening well spend.
","I have always been a great fan of the original series, featuring John Thaw as Morse. I always thought the stories were well written and televised. Which is as important. These series have me in awe. I am completely blown away. I am a great fan of the Montalbano character in the RaiUno-series. Also well written. And well televised. But this is something different. There is suspense. There is character. And there is life. I don't know how to put it otherwise. Of course we know how Morse became in his later life, but there was no history, no growing- up. These series show the growth of the character, by an actor who seems to be raised to do this. Shaun Evans does a masterpiece. I am afraid he'll be Endeavour Morse for the rest of his life.",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2013,simonv-648-292176,9," The difficult first of the 'real' series is an amazing success
","After the surprisingly well handled one-off prequel, Shaun Evans is back as the young detective Endeavour Morse. Just like the original series with John Thaw, its success hinges on the charisma and personality of the lead character. Here Evans excels and carries the whole thing off handsomely. His performance portrays obvious knowledge and classical moral values but also an eager curiosity, drive and a naive humility which reminds us throughout this episode that he is a new recruit of sorts. The only issue I could find to quibble with is the almost Sherlockian mythology that has been added. In the original he was a knowledgeable and sharp police detective whereas here he is very much the deductive crime-fighter. As a Conan Doyle fan I do approve a little of the mythologizing but it needs to keep its roots with the original and down to earth.",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2018,lyninbyron,10," ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT BRITISH DRAMA
","Endeavour is the young Morse. I've just finished the fifth season and I want more more more please! 
A BIG well done to all involved. The plots, characters, acting and sets, everything, was spot on and most enjoyable and thought provoking. Thank you ...o....and... more please!",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2017,lancer165,8," Why has this gripped me more than Morse
",I have now got up to date with this series. I have enjoyed over time the other offshoot Lewis but must say that my interest has been mostly in Hathaway and hope that it might continue along that path.,/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2019,peterrichboy,9," A prequel that surpasses the original
",I have to confess to not being a fan of Morse. I always felt the stories set amongst the leafy spires of Oxford University were all very much the the same old tale of a student from the past seeking revenge for some foul play that happened in a cricket match 30 years earlier.,/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv

11 April 2014,chris-holdroyd,9," Endeavour stands on its own, even if you've never seen Thaw's Morse
","This is a far more intellectual treatment of the later Morse, or Lewis characters. The writing is excellent and doesn't try to explain more than necessary, allowing the audience to draw nearer, and in doing so, draw their own conclusions.",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2017,jdhb-768-61234,10," Initial fears blown away

18 August 2019,Kirpianuscus,," special
","Shaun Evans performance was the basic motif for see this serie who escapes to the circle of cases, to gives not only solutions to terrible murders but who use , in brilliant manner the nuances for realistic portraits. A serie about people looking for accepting themselves and for respect their profound values. A sort of revelation because it does not propose Princes Charmings , heroes or models but a sort of confessions about vulnerabilities becoming the axis of strong men.",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2020,Dr_Coulardeau,9," Quaint and intimate
","This series is a ""remake of sorts"" of an older series, Inspector Morse. They kept the historical time of the 1960s, just before and after Harold Wilson's decision to honor the British Passport distributed some decades before, or if you prefer before independence in the Indian subcontinent and thus to let the passport holders immigrate into the British Isles, the United Kingdom, as full British citizens. So, this modern series looks quaint in many ways, cars, fridges, televisions, and all.",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2021,rchrdcorteel1,6," Series 8 a complete misfire
","Have always enjoyed Endeavour. Series 7 hinted at character problems for Morse, and these were expanded on in Series 8. Unfortunately the first two episodes are nowhere near up to previous standards, and thereby do not deliver well on the matter of Morse's growing problems.",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv

14 September 2019,pswanson00,10," Superb
","During the last 24 hours I've watched all 4 episodes of the 6th season of Endeavour. It is such a good show that I can hardly express it. The writing, acting, production values, and direction are as fine as those in any film I've ever seen. Now I have to wait in hope for season 7.",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2021,shashrvacai,9," Amazing show!
","Maintains everything that makes Inspector Morse so good, while also containing enough to make it its own. Every bit as entertaining and every bit as tense as the original drama. Pacing is restrained, but that allows the atmosphere to come through. The characters are interesting, and are evolving more and more with every episode. All the acting is very good, but it's the performances of Evans and Allam that will always be remembered most vividly.",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2018,OoX1966,10," The last TV show worth watching
","With the decline of good TV shows, I will say that Endeavour continues to be the best show I've seen in quite some time. The characters, cast and plots are perfect. As of today, Endeavour is the only TV show that I spare time to watch.",/review/rw4051145/?ref_=tt_urv
