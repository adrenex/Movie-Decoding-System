22 October 2005,MaxBorg89,10," Dr.Lecter, I'd like to see you again...
","The Silence of the Lambs runs two hours.Anthony Hopkins appears for little more than sixteen minutes, yet during those minutes he hasn't bored you for a second, not even after the tenth or eleventh viewing. Such is the power of his performance, it's absolutely impossible to forget him.His character, Dr.Hannibal""The Cannibal"" Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste(you can interpret that as you like).A clichè by now, but who cares? He still is one of the key elements in this wonderful thriller, which sees Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling asking for Lecter's help to catch another killer.The result is a dangerous yet fascinating relationship between the young, unexperienced FBI-agent and the convicted,but basically omnipotent, psychiatrist.He's a step ahead of everyone all the time, and makes sure everyone notices, with his witty, unforgettable one-liners.If there had to be only one reason to worship this movie, then it would have to be the chemistry between the two leading actors.Never before has a non-sexual man/woman connection been more thrilling.Never before has a film's ending been more unsettling and brilliant and left us asking for more.",/review/rw6853674/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2000,tfrizzell,," In a Class by Itself
","Brilliant Best Picture of 1991 that never gets old.  ""The Silence of the Lambs"" deals with a young FBI cadet (Oscar-winner Jodie Foster) who is sent to interview a captured madman (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen) to find out about a serial killer (Ted Levine) who is stripping the skin from his female victims after they die.  The FBI has had no luck with the case and agent Scott Glenn tries to throw a curve-ball to Hopkins by sending Foster.  Hopkins is a former doctor of Levine and holds the clues to capturing the unknown criminal.  Needless to say the film takes many twists and turns, creating a suspenseful thriller that has no equal.  At the heart of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" are the confrontations between Hopkins and Foster.  They play a complicated chess match of words which results in some of the greatest footage ever captured for the cinema.  Hopkins dominates in spite of the fact he has approximately 17 minutes of time in the film.  This is a film that will wrap itself around you and you will likely never be able to shake some of the key elements you have seen in this amazing masterpiece.  5 stars out of 5.",/review/rw6853674/?ref_=tt_urv

",I first saw this in the early 90s on a vhs and i still remember how two very old ladies were petrified n blabbering about the movie to my dad and one thing which stayed with me after that conversation was the praising of Hopkins acting by the two grumbling old geezers.,/review/rw6853674/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've seen way too many thrillers. You name it: ""Identity"", ""Seven"", ""The Usual Suspects"", etc., etc., etc. I remember my friend being so obsessed with ""Silence of the Lambs"", that it drove me crazy. And I hated the movie naturally and refused to see it. But everyone told me that I have to see this, so I let my guard down. And had an open mind, and I'm glad I did. My friend was right, this is a great movie. It is so well acted, I couldn't even describe. I loved ""Silence of the Lambs"" and would recommend it to anyone. It's creepy and exciting.

",This is definitely a film that proves you don't need tons of blood and gore to have a good suspense film.  Anthony Hopkins performance as the deranged genius Lecter earned him a well deserved Academy Award and the same was true of Jodie Foster's performance as Clarice Starling.  This film should go down in history as one of the greatest suspense films in the history of cinema.,/review/rw6853674/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 1999,pooch-8,," Perfectly executed dramatic thriller
","The Silence of the Lambs, having accomplished the rare feat of winning all five of the major Academy Award categories, is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking.  Gruesome, pulpish material was transformed by dedicated participants on all levels of production, and a film that would have failed in the hands of many others wound up becoming a modern masterpiece.  Taut direction and a superb screenplay might be the best arguments for the film's power, but the flashiest are certainly delivered in the bravura performances of Hopkins and Foster.  Their interplay -- and remember, they only share a handful of scenes together -- is nothing short of riveting.",/review/rw6853674/?ref_=tt_urv

","Sweeping all five major Academy Awards (""Oscars"" for Best Movie, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) is quite an accomplishment.  Doing it nearly a year after a film was released is a miracle considering the notoriously short attention span of Oscar voters.  It is a powerful example of how great a movie can be when superb writers, directors, actors, and others work at the top of their craft.",/review/rw6853674/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2000,BaronBl00d,," Class Act
","With Silence of the Lambs comes some much needed recognition for the horror genre.  It is a first-rate production all around.  It boasts a witty and suspenseful script based on the Thomas Harris novel, full of great lines. It has marvelous direction from Demme.  Demme creates suspense very well throughout and uses some great directorial shots such as the twin frames of Clarice ringing a doorbell and the FBI men breaking into a home.  The two lead actors won oscars for their performances...each deserved.  Foster is very good in her role, but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights up the screen with his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer.  Hopkins does the seemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness and yet illicts some pity/compassion(albeit not a lot) for his situation.  He says his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed.  The rest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as a unethical, petty doctor in charge of Hopkins.  Of course the story of the other killer is very very chilling as well.  A quality film in all aspects!",/review/rw6853674/?ref_=tt_urv

30 October 2005,Theo Robertson,8," Very Effective Thriller But Ultimately Overrated
","It's impossible to comment on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as being a mere film . Its release was a watershed in popular culture and has influenced a myriad of imitations that are far too numerous to mention . Much of this success is down to director Jonathan Demme who has made the film so effective by coming up with the strikingly simple idea of filming everything in dim lighting which gives SILENCE a moody and brooding atmosphere that was absent from movies in the previous decade . Ironically enough this is as typical of 90s film making as MANHUNTER was of 80s movies . Howard Shore's score also helps the proceedings and Jodie Foster gives a sublime nuanced performance as vulnerable heroine Clarice Starling . Watch the scenes closely when Clarice is in the company of men , don't you get the feeling she has a phobia about the male of the species . Is she a victim of sexual abuse in her childhood ? A lesbian ? We never find out but Foster's performance is multi layered and it's a pity this aspect is never explored in HANNIBAL which sadly deletes this aspect to Clarice ",/review/rw6853674/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 2019,pmtelefon,5," Top ten most overrated movies of all time.
","Overrated doesn't mean bad. It just means that something is not as good as people say it is. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" isn't a bad movie. It's an okay movie. The best part of the movie is the music. It gives the movie a creepy vibe. The rest of the movie isn't so hot. This is the kind of movie that while you are watching it you think it's really good. But when it's over and you begin to think about what you just watched, you realize that it's pretty dumb. Hannibal Lector escapes by wearing a dead guy's face. Silly. Oh by the way, how did Lector steal the pen? They don't tell you because it would have been impossible for him to steal it. Now after all these years (and years of CSI type tv shows) the little gross out elements that ""The Silence of the Lambs"" has seem awfully tame. It's an okay, and I guess somewhat mandatory, watch.",/review/rw6853674/?ref_=tt_urv

","It is a creepy and taken-by-storm experience with the film, background music is darker than the film itself and too ominous, plot is brilliantly constructed, conversations are thought-provocative, to crown the whole, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkin are the cream. They take ownership of Clarice and Hannibal respectively, transforming them into the most unforgettable screen images.",/review/rw6853674/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2017,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,4," Why?
","Look, ""overrated"" doesn't necessarily mean bad. I liked this film when it first came out, and I found it very entertaining. But the extremely high amount of praise that this film gets, makes no sense to me at all. The supposedly menacing and creepy Hannibal Lecter, who ate his victims and is now locked away from society, sounds totally ridiculous with his cheesy one-liners about cannibalism and killing. Jodie Foster, who plays our main protagonist (an elite FBI agent in training) looks and sounds about thirteen years old, and the entire time I was watching, she kept reminding me of an actress from a television after-school special playing dress-up and pretending to be a cop. The pace of this film was rather dull as well, unnecessarily long with hammy characters that seem like they belong in a Troma movie rather than anything highly rated. It still blows my mind that a brilliant film like ""The Killing Fields"" has never been selected for national preservation, but this corny crime thriller was. Honestly I've seen low-budget slashers better than this thing... so why the high reputation and constant fans saying ""oh god, this film is awesome! Hannibal is soooo sexy!"" and all that? To each their own, everybody likes different things, but with this one, which currently has an 8.6/10 overall rating on IMDb, how did that even happen? Was this one of those ""right place at the right time"" kind of things where it hits a generation by doing something innovative for the time, thus becoming popular? Or is there seriously something here I'm missing? I've watched it several times and I don't find it complex or overly intriguing in any way whatsoever. And I really like Foster and Hopkins as actors, from Hopkins' role as the grieving father in Audrey-Rose, to Foster as the dying little girl on a Nova Scotia vacation in Echoes of a Summer, but in this film it tries to put them together in some sort of tragic love story, which really plays out strangely. I kept cringing at Foster's character's pretentiousness and show-off attitude and Hannibal Lecter's pointless riddles and games, which are interesting at first but quickly become boring and stupid.",/review/rw6853674/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2017,notoriousCASK,10," One of the Greatest Thrillers of all Time.
","The Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece you cannot miss, it's a masterwork of suspense that blends the elements of horror, crime and psychology into one tight and smooth story. It's only the third film in history to win Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay and that imply something about its technical quality as a film. It features expertise level of craftsmanship in all departments of filmmaking, and takes a huge bonus from the exquisite performances put in by its stellar cast.

","Great job by Foster and Hopkins.  Hannibal's part could have been fleshed out a little more, though (sorry, couldn't resist that one).
