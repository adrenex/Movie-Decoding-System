28 June 2021,MOscarbradley,9," I loved every crazy, off-the-wall moment.
","Bernadette is the kind of woman you would cross the road to avoid and who would also cross the road to avoid meeting you and she's just the perfect character for Cate Blanchett to add to her portfolio of oddballs. She's also married to something of an oddball, (Billy Crudup), who's some kind of computer genius and between them they have managed to create a nice, normal teenage daughter, (newcomer Emma Nelson, superb), and they all live in a Seattle mansion that is literally falling apart. But Bernadette isn't just a sociopathic oddball; she is, or was, a great architect who dropped out and whose midlife crisis has lasted a couple of decades.",/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2020,Kirpianuscus,," I love it
","Just I love it. Not only for the basic motif than Cate Blanchett is one of my favorit actress , for the art of Billy Crudup or because the young Emma nelson reminds me one of my students, but because all is...just lovely. Amix of depression, family, life , passion, loneliness and the result of vocation. An adorable film. Just an adorable one. For storytelling, acting, humor , extravagance and tension. And in few scenes, for the status of mirror.",/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2019,thesuthernman,9," Another underrated non-mainstream film.
","Yes, it's a Hollywood film with all the clever coincidences and neat n' tidy endings, but it is also very clever, well acted, and even poetic. Go see a film that doesn't involve flying superheroes, gun fights, or animated toys...you'll be glad you did.",/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2019,sage-42618,8," This movie deserves a better chance
","This movie hasn't been treated well by ""the critics,"" but neither were movies like ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" ""The Wizard of Oz,"" and many others. Sometimes critics don't see what is in front of them. The pacing only seems slow if you're spending your other reviews telling people how wonderful super hero and ""Fast and Furious"" movies are. How can it be slow if the whole thing takes place over a period of about three weeks? It's paced the way it should be to allow a good look at Bernadette, who she is, how she got there and the demons she deals with. It's a wonderful look at the closeness between a daughter and her mother, when the daughter often finds herself being the more mature of the two. The best part of the movie, as it should be, is Bernadette, played to mercurial perfection by Cate Blanchett. Under the obvious disruption of a manic personality, Blanchett also allows the intelligence, humor and pain of the character to show through. It's a tremendous performance and, fortunately, some of the awards are paying attention to it despite the critics. It's a thoughtful, but also very funny movie. People should give it a chance.",/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2020,aslisonceley,9," A menace
","She must create so she doesn't become a menace to society. A beautiful insight into the mind of an artist who bottled up her creative drive, and became dysfunctional.",/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2019,Intermissionman_,9," Felt Joyful
",Cate Blanchett really seems to relish these sort of quirky characters. You can feel the Joy she puts into this role. A Family Comedy about an eccentric Woman whose daughter is about to leave for Boarding School. Definitely one of the better Films I have seen this year. The South Pole trip is spectacular ! Bet Nice Cast had a Blast making the Movie. Not your everyday storyline either. I recommend watching some interviews with the Cast online after to gain a better understanding of the characters. Gonna get the Book.,/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2019,palofsophie,7," Take your kids
","Some reviewers criticized the film's pacing, I was fine with it. It's clear from the beginning the family is non-tradiotional, living in partially renovated, unkempt colossal house in a high end Seattle among well kept homes. Snobbery abounds. The viewer wonders about the past and it is revealed little by little in various ways. Bernadette & her daughter are unusually close, the parents less so. The ultimate strength of their bonds is what drives the last 1/3. I did snort-laugh a few times, for the record. A good film for families ( kids over 12 or so) to watch which may lead to discussions. Cate B's performance is excellent!",/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2020,TxMike,," After a 20 year funk, can Bernadette get her mojo back?
","My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library. We enjoyed it, all actors are good in the roles and to me Blanchett turns in one of her better performances as the genius architect that ceased to create after her difficulties with pregnancy and motherhood.",/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2021,cjenkinson-66190,9," Loved it!

17 August 2019,alanm-30942,9," Different, thoughtful, much to say about modern life
","My wife and I went to see this movie because Kristen Wiig is in it and it looked like it would be funny. It is funny - but it is a lot more. It is quirky (we love quirky movies!), edgy, sometimes uncomfortable, but mostly enlightening (as in bringing light in). It could have been titled ""Where'd you go Human Spirit?"", or ""Where'd you go Imagination?, or ""This is what happens to society when fear drives honest, loving, intelligent people to start acting weird and give up on each other"". And it shows us the answer in a very positive way.
So, it was not Bridesmaids. Closer to ""Welcome to Me"" or ""Skeleton Twins"" maybe (I loved both), but not really like any other movie I can think of.
Note: The critics seemed to not like it. That is almost a sure sign of a good movie to me. Bless their pointy little heads.",/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2019,boblipton,8," Cate Tries For Another Oscar
","Twenty years ago, Cate Blanchett was a leading architect in Los Angeles. She had just won a MacArthur Grant. Something went wrong with something called ""The 20-Mile House"" and she vanished. Well, she moved with husband BillY Crudup (who's looking more and more like Willem Dafoe) to Seattle, where he's got a project with Microsoft that encompasses mindreading, while she raises their daughter and has alienated all the neighbors. Kristen Wiig, a Stepford mother is complaining that the raspberries from Blanchett's house is invading her property, so Cate tells her to have her guy deal with it. Then she runs over Miss Wiig's foot, and during the next storm, the entire hill comes into the Wiig household. When Crudup tries an intervention with a psychiatrist, she vanishes again.",/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2019,jimandkent,8," We've All Been There
","Started out at little slow and ended strong. The Director took to long to help us understand the complexity of Bernadette and her real struggles -which we can all identify with, so that we really liked and rooted for her. Once the movie got there it took off and ended strong. One criticism overall and not so much about this movie but an overall statement. If a movie is set in a specific city - film it in that city. There were obvious obligatory scenes of Seattle but It was clearly filmed mostly elsewhere.",/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2019,roger-99-171599,8," Cynically funny and timely.
","It's fabulous and very touching. Cate is amazing once again. It's true it is master Linklater's least creative effort, but it delivers powerful statements on family values and perseverance. A crowd pleasing mainstream flick, cynically funny and timely.",/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2019,amadour-87687,8," A Rare Find
","Rarely will you ever find a movie with a cast that works so seamlessly together. My God, they must have rehearsed forever. I got lost inside the performances unable to recognize the screen had borders. I felt like I was functioning as the camera, recording, experiencing, reacting. Sometimes it was uncomfortable sharing her family's travails, at other times I was privy to the fun a real family can experience when their emotions are genuine. I cheered, outwardly, actually, verbally! I've never done that. And, I wept tears, real tears, I was a soggy mess by the end of the movie. It was a very good movie. Even if you don't share what I shared you will appreciate what great acting and filmmaking can do for your soul. I thank everyone associated with this fine film; well done! ...I've also never done that before either...",/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2019,McKennaTroup,9," Surprised by how much I loved it
","I ended up seeing this movie to kill some time and I am so glad I did. As someone with anxiety, depression, and past trauma, this movie moved me. The way people can judge others with mental health issues when they have no idea what it's like, is appalling. Cate Blanchet's portrayal of someone fighting inner demons while fighting people who completely misunderstand her is awe-inspiring. I highly recommend this movie for anyone- especially anyone who has or knows someone with mental health issues. I will be taking everyone I know to see this movie.",/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2020,stephenevans-93802,10," Honestly, this should be Best Picture, it's not a ""musical or comedy"" wtf!
","I have seen many of the films up for the Golden Globe for best picture. I loved Rocketman and JoJo Rabbit, I didn't like Joker, Irishman was okay. Marriage Story was great, but so sad and depressing. I had no idea what to expect with this film, but I loved it all the way thru, especially how it all tied together at the end. I don't know why this is listed as a comedy. There was some amusing bits, but it was hardly a comedy. Why goober decided to label it that? And I especially dont get the multitude of bad reviews, except if people were expectin a comedy, duh! It is a drama story, period! It is every bit as good as Marriage Story, and a whole lot more interesting and fun to watch. A worthy movie with a real heart and soul. Lots of good food for the soul in this. Shame on the doofus who labeled it a comedy. This is my pick for Best Picture, if only I had a vote. :)",/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2019,Horst_In_Translation,8," A pretty nice modern tale on finding yourself
","""Where'd You Go, Bernadette"", or just the brief version ""Bernadette"", is a new American 2019 movie that runs for 110 minutes almost and features some pretty famous people in front of and behind the camera. The latter is Richard Linklater. I really adore his ""Before""-trilogy (maybe quadrology at some point) and also found Boyhood fairly amazing, so I was naturally curious about his new release. As for the cast, at the center of it all is 2-time Academy Award winner Cate Blanchett and her I like as well, so the basics certainly looked promising for me. And I was not disappointed. While it really took me until almost the end pretty much to give this 4 stars out of 5 and not ""only"" 3, there is a lot I liked about this one nonetheless. I do think Blanchett is one of the best actresses when it comes to dramatic characters. This is a dramatic character and she nails all the more serious moments and I never felt as if I wasn't watching a genuine character, even if admittedly she is not always 100% on the more comedic moments and there are many. It is a healthy mix between these two genres. But still, she is also good enough in those and it is certainly not a letdown. The only consequence probably is that she is not as much the heart and soul of the film as you could have guessed from the title and poster and she has better performances in her body of work. Still she carried the film nicely. I also think her character is pretty unique the way she was written. I mean she is clearly really anti-social and does not get along well with people. Or I should say with people outside her family because honestly the bond between her and her daughter is something truly unique and as strong as everything I ever witnessed when it comes to touching mother-daughter relationships. Certainly the most memorable aspect of the film for me. The scene when the two are talking to the neighbor (played by Wiig) and really standing up for each other and fighting like lions is really memorable. But there are shorter moments too that stay in the mind, for example when we hear a nickname that Blanchett's character calls her daughter and her dad uses it and the girl says she does not feel comfortable with it really. Or when we hear the voice-over close to the end already when they are looking for her and there is a brief inclusion whether the character may be dead, the girl says something her mother is out there and she wants to be with her daughter at this point. That was really sweet. There are many more examples. You will recognize them when they are there. As for the death suspense I just mentioned, of course Bernadette is alive and we know it and only a bad filmmaker would have really turned this into serious drama on this idea. Linklater is too good for that.",/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2019,tigerfish50,1," Bernadette Sinks like a Stone
","Richard Linklater has made several movies notable for their originality and excellence - with 'Dazed and Confused', 'Tape', 'Boyhood' and the 'Before Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight' trilogy being the cream of the crop. He has also made a couple of clunkers, but Bernadette is almost certainly his career low. The acting, script and direction are so abysmal, it's hard to know whether the film was intended to be a drama, comedy or farce.",/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2019,blanbrn,6," In depth look at life and being up and down and wanting and doing an escape!
","Director Richard Linklater is one that does movies in an in depth manner as they are long drawn out and almost always deal with life and personal matters. And most viewers as they watch can relate to them and most face some in real life. This latest ""Where'd You Go, Bernadette"" is one that deals with somewhat of a midlife drama as the head character wants a change and escape to a new scene all while wanting to live past glory again.",/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2020,srobertson-75103,8," OVERALL ENJOYABLE, KIND OF FUNNY IN A DARK WAY
","This film was a good night's entertainment. It had it's funny moments, sad moments and everything in between. I think many of us can see a bit of ourselves in the main character. It's nice to see a movie show the not-so-perfect side of neighbors, marriage and parenthood in a funny kind of way. Cate Blanchette is very versatile and was perfect for this role.",/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2020,The_Boxing_Cat,1," Stupid 👎pointlessly annoying. SKIP this mess.
",I was so annoyed by Bernadette that I was hoping they would never find her. Almost to the point that I don't want to see another Cate Blanchett film ever again. She should stay away from anything other than straight drama- her timing is waaay off. The kid was annoying too. UGH,/review/rw5440257/?ref_=tt_urv
