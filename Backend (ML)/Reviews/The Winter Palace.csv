18 May 2020,ThomDerd,10," It's personal.
","A great docu-series, kudos on the direction and putting it all together, making it very exciting to watch. Undeniably, Michael Jordan is the master in finding motivation. For every episode, every grudge, every game...it's getting personal for Michael. The rest of the Bulls protagonists also make this dynasty memorable and they all together bring back a nostalgia for the 90s. But for Mike, it's always personal.
Overall, some time jumps are confusing and some important things maybe are brushed off too fast, while other events get a greater mention than they should; that's the only negative thing I could spot. The rest looks great, especially the remastered footage and the interviews.
If you are not familiar with the 90s Bulls and Michael Jordan then this will provide a 360 view on the legend. 10/10",/review/rw7722768/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2020,danielcereto,10," The Last Dance
","As a basketball lover that grew up watching Michael as an idol this series called ""The last dance"" is just an amazing dream. I was only a teenager during the 90's with barely access to NBA basketball or footage. So, all the episodes are just amazing. Pretty intense, interesting and an amazing way to understand how Michael Jordan become the best NBA basketball Player of all time and at the same time understand how was his last dance with the Chicago Bulls.",/review/rw7722768/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,10," One of the best sports documentaries of all-time!
","As a basketball player who grew up watching Michael Jordan, this documentary was absolutely amazing! For those of you that were too young, this was a great introduction to the best player of all-time! This documentary shows both the ups and downs of one of the best dynasties in sports history and an inside look at one of the best athletes to ever walk this planet! The ONLY people who seem to not like this documentary and rate it low are 12-year old LeBron fans (not all, just the Jordan haters) who can't stand the FACT that 90% of the world thinks Jordan is easily the best ever. It's not even an argument when 9 out of 10 people believe one thing and in this case it's that Jordan is the GOAT. But that 1 out of 10 keep trying...God bless em!",/review/rw7722768/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,allmoviesfan,8," The Last Dance
","One of the best - if not the very best - sports documentary I have ever seen, but the rating I've given it is because of the distinct lack of Luc Langley, who won three championships with MJ, Scottie, Dennis and Phil, but is rarely, if ever, sighted. As an Aussie, that's not good enough. More Luc! But seriously, The Last Dance is a brilliant look into the final NBA title that the Bulls won with Jordan and Jackson before the team was rebuilt, with it's core going their seperate ways. Present-day interviews are interspersed with game footage and interviews from the era. Some very interesting revelations from all sorts of people in and around what is arguably the greatest basketball dynasty in history. Highly recommended!",/review/rw7722768/?ref_=tt_urv

4 October 2021,Supermanfan-13,10," A must watch for any sports fan!
","This documentary is about the best player of all-time in Michael Jordan and how he led the best team of all-team in the Chicago Bulls as they make a run for their sixth championship in the last year the team competed together. You don't even have to be a Jordan fan, or even a basketball fan for that matter, to enjoy this documentary. It's terrific, the only thing that I didn't like that much was how they time jumped so much. This documentary has unseen footage and candid interviews as it goes in depths into the team and the pressure they were under to win. It will make you emotionally invested whether you're a fan or not. If you want a compelling documentary on one of the best sports dynasties ever then give this a try!",/review/rw7722768/?ref_=tt_urv

","Michael Jordan is one of the most accomplished and celebrated sportsmen of all time. Chronicling the superstar basketballer's career and rise to fame, The Last Dance tells the tale of Jordan and the Chicago Bulls dynasty of the 90s that won six NBA Championships in eight years.",/review/rw7722768/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2020,greg-goremykin,10," Why 10/10 isn't overstating it.
","I've had never liked Michael Jordan (the hazards of being a Pistons fan I guess, you grab onto anything the slightest bit negative about someone you're predisposed to not like, that confirmation bias), just like as a Tigers, Wings and Lions fan I dislike all the icons over the years with the Sox and Cubs, 'Hawks, or Bears either. The rivalries between Detroit and Chicago with all our rival teams for so many years being in the same conferences and divisions, you are almost expected to loathe each others' teams and fans.",/review/rw7722768/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2022,mg-231645,," Bulls Dynasty!
","Back in 2020 when I watched this on Netflix, it delivers an outstanding documentary of Michael Jordan & Chicago Bulls. This documentary totally indicates how the bulls started an all-time dynasty team. I really appreciate the story it was so amazing, MJ shows how to lead a team by motivating his teammates. Scottie Pippen also shares one of his career experiences during his time on the bulls.",/review/rw7722768/?ref_=tt_urv

24 February 2022,trapp_33,9," masterpiece
","The series shows you the way to ascend from beginning to end and the way they move in the timeline is something special and I have not seen it before, and how it shows you that the team's journey was not easy and smooth. They went through many difficulties to win titles and the most beautiful thing is that it is a true story and not a fantasy and I loved the way the characters moved between now and before, the music was great, and the way the events progressed was beautiful and flawless.",/review/rw7722768/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2021,alindsayal,9," A Fantastic Sports Documentary
","This is the documentary that has been taking over the world the last few months and I have now finished The Last Dance and here is my review for it. The premise of the show focuses on the final season of the dominant Chicago Bulls Basketball team as they went for a sixth championship, it mainly focuses on the superstar Michael Jordan but also gives some of the backstory of his teammates and the history of the team towards there previous championships.",/review/rw7722768/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2020,robotikarm,9," Amazing!
","As a Pacers fan, I HATED Jordan and the Bulls because they were always the team to beat. Watching this as an adult gave me a different perspective and I have to respect Michael Jordan for his leadership and talent. I wish there were 10 more episodes to watch!",/review/rw7722768/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,chris082179,9," Amazing
","The series is very well put together and is by far the greatest sports documentary I have ever seen of the greatest sports story I have ever seen.

20 April 2020,drbarbc-526-517466,10," This is perfect!
","I'm huge fan of MJ, having watched him since his NC days. I watched every Bulls game during their championship seasons. I also scored floor seats to his last game @ the United Center when he came back w/the Wizards. (In case you're curious how he was received, arriving with the visiting team - to a standing ovation that lasted so long they had to blink the lights.) This miniseries is PERFECT, it's so well done, it's such a precious gift during quarantine. Watch it now!!",/review/rw7722768/?ref_=tt_urv

19 May 2020,vth-06551,," When this ended I just said ""damn""
","I have always been a skeptic of Michael Jordan... I was born in 1998, and have grown up watching watching LeBron. I have always known that Michael Jordan is refered to as the G.O.A.T, but after watching Lebron throughout his career, I could never imagine anyone being better than him. I was on the brink of thinking that MJ's greatness was some kind of a ""myth"". After all, MJ is rarely presenting himself and rarely reaching out to the world today. I had only watched highlights of him and heard stories about him being a bully towards his teammates. Therefore I always imagined him as somewhat careless and arrogant.",/review/rw7722768/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2021,pn977,10," By Far the best sports documentary
","It's really hard to be able to impress the audience with a sports documentary. But The Last Dance somehow beautifully manages to make every revolutionary detail pop out. Its definitely a plus point that Michael Jordan ACTUALLY did change the game of basketball forever. There will be that one guy who comes around and elevates the game, and that's exactly what Michael Jordan portrayed through this documentary. Its a must watch, go for it!",/review/rw7722768/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2022,JurijFedorov,8," Overall great
","There are some great things here. Overall it just works and is very entertaining, educational, and presents the best possible history of Chicago Bulls and Michael Jordan you could have asked for. There are a ton of great scenes filmed during that period and a ton of great modern interview to go with it. Especially in 1998 where a camera crew followed the team you got close-up scenes that pretty much put the viewer in their dressing room. It's so personal that this is absolutely impossible to make in 99,9% of cases. You just don't have enough historical recordings lying around you can reuse like this. You need to get creative and animate scenes, have more interviews, then you can show scores, photos, newspapers, sounds, modern shots of the buildings. Here all of that is not needed. They have more than enough videos to make this all work perfectly as a proper historical documentary. Especially because basketball games are filmed close up. If you watch soccer games we only have grainy recordings from 90's games and player faces are not seen unless the TV producer that day decided to show a player face. We don't have all these extra recordings lying around anywhere so soccer documentaries are always a bit impersonal. Here it's fully personal and you walk with Michael Jordan.",/review/rw7722768/?ref_=tt_urv
