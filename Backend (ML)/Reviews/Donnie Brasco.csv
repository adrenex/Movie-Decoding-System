19 April 2022,frankblack-79961,8," They better make another season.
",Very intriguing series. Good storytelling. Good characters as in most of them have common sense. Good horror tv. Gory as heck in parts. Lots of mysterious things to ponder. I very much enjoyed season 1 and hope they make another. There's not many good horror tv shows out there anymore. This is a good one imo.,/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,syd9907,9," I'm Hooked...Period!
","It's a slow burner, but it has me hooked. I want to know why these people are trapped in this town and who or what has trapped them. And Harold Perrineau just soaks up the oxygen when he's on-screen. He's such an excellent actor. And you truly want to know what his backstory is, especially with his son. I think if people just be patient and allow the story to unfold, there will be an excellent pay-off. Lost was slow like this and it ultimately became a hit. I like for a story to unfold slowly so we can develop a sense of knowing who these characters are and in this case, what is stalking them and why.",/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2022,fatfil-414-451797,9," Excellent horror series which keeps you guessing
","I am really enjoying this series, really hanging out for every episode. Very surprised by the negative comments and reviews, calling it boring. I found it anything but, great acting, and an excellent script. Perhaps it's the Squid Game generation, just wanting to see lots of poeple killed for no particular reason other than greed, and not having to think too hard. Granted there isn't much action in the first couple of episodes, but lots for character building and back story which is intriguing. It's hard to say too much without givng things away, but lots of twists and turns and shocks along the way. If you enjoy good storytelling with, despite comments to the contary, plenty of horror and shocks thrown in, this is highly recommended.",/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," It will keep you entertained!
","I wasn't sure what to expect from From. I've read everything from it's like Lost to it's a generic horror version of Lost. Lost is one of my favorite shows ever and the reviews for this have been mostly positive so I figured I'd give it a try and I'm glad I did. I was hooked from the first episode to the last. I'm so glad they already renewed this because there are so many unanswered questions still. That's probably the only negative thing I have say about his show, that it didn't offer enough answers in the first season. It takes a little time to really get going but once it does you'll be addicted and want to binge it as quickly as possible.",/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2022,midnitepantera,7," Wow! Alot of good actors and Very Disturbing Story! :o
","I'm enjoying this series so far, it's not anything really original, but it does have its moments here and there. Very much reminds me of Wayward Pines as others have mentioned. But it has it's own little twists and tweaks, and 5 episodes in and they haven't really given away much about what is out in the Woods and how does this town Trap people from all over. It is like a Twilight Zone styled episode, drawn out into a series.",/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Has Me Hooked!
","From was every bit as good as all the hype surrounding it. It was definitely a lot better than anything I was expecting. Even though there is horror and some gore in it, this show is so much more than just some horror show. I know a lot of reviews have compared it to Lost and while it's nowhere near as good as that show I can see where they get the comparison. It's a very clever show that has a lot of unknown and mystery to it. Every answer we get just leads to more questions and I'm worried that there's going to be more questions than answers but so far it has been a fun show to watch. It's popular enough to have already been renewed for a second season so I'm looking forward to more.",/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,aubuchon,8," Better than I expected.
","The preview looked like a hodgepodge of several different shows like Wayward Pines ,Lost and a little Under the Dome thrown in. I expected it to have a vague storyline after seeing that it's produced by the same makers as Lost but it has a solid storyline and the characters are likable. While not perfect, it does have suspense and is good enough to keep me hooked. A pleasant surprise.",/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2022,k_tomb,9," FAR better than the bad reviews.
","The show has good acting, a VERY interesting story, and has JUST BEGAN! I watched the first 6 episodes, and the feel and tone of the show is a bit mysterious, a bit depressing, but very interesting. It is not a huge budged show, but more along the lines of a big budged Twilight Zone episode. Great scenery, an interesting ""Town"", and I can not wait to see where this all goes. Everyone saying it is slow, simply want a lot of action or big reveals or cliffhanger endings. This show is paced moderately slowly, but has FAR better atmosphere building slowly, instead of the false big reveals most shows employ.",/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2022,day25,10," Great so far
",From the creators of Lost...of course I'm gonna watch this! Loving it so far. Some of the actors are so so and annoying but others are intriguing. Love the main actor who was in Lost also.,/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2022,theomniman-59622,8," Why all the hate?
",Having seen the 1st 3 episodes i can say that I will surely be here for the entire season and beyond if they get another. It's been solid. Good story good characters good monsters. I like the premise. I personally haven't seen much problem with the acting as some people have said. Give it a shot.,/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2022,baybeh_girl,10," Creepy AF
",Love it. It's different and creepy it's going to be a good one I can tell! I like the actors. Some shows the actors aren't great but they are on this one.,/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2022,deijmaster-49968,7," Not bad, great potential but is it another Lost?
","The show has potential and many great possible outcomes, but I fear this may be another kind of Lost.",/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2022,nenms11,10," 10 episodes done
",Before I decide my rating I waited for 10 episodes. The story line has climbed and piqued my attention. The backstory is interesting and I can't wait to find out where the night crawlers are from.,/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2022,AfricanBro,7," Can't wait for everything to unfold.
","I had really low expectations for this but I'm a fan of dystopian series so I was intrigued to see what it was about. I don't know if I'm impressed because I didn't expect it to be any good or if it's actually pretty decent so far. Sorta reminds me of wayward pines with an added gory touch. I think it's well thought out but there are some things that I keep wondering about, like where's the electricity coming from, or the livestock that Kenny says they don't know comes from. Or the ghost zombie creatures origin, why only show up at night, where the totem things they hang are from; but the show just premiered and there's still 7 episodes to go to explore that, I'm just hoping they don't leave us with unnecessary plot holes or left out details because this looks like a potentially good show and I'm really excited for it. I don't want it to end up like ""Yellowjackets"" which kept teasing in each episode that there was so much more to the story and the savagery it was gonna show, it was so stretched out yet at the end didn't deliver any of that. Just like yellowjackets, everything in ""From"" is pretty decent, the production, acting, the storyline... hopefully it doesn't hold back on the thriller aspect as well. I've seen people complain about the acting but I think it's okay, sure no one's winning an Emmy here but it's not terrible. I just think the background characters are wayy too in the background, they could talk more to give us a better impression on the town. I don't know if it's based on a book but the name is not alluring enough, still, the show has great potential and if done right could last several seasons.",/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,georgegates,8," Ignore the bad ratings
",It feels like LOST writers had a talk with M. Night Shyamalan. You will encounter a lot of similar psychological horror. The show is very scary.,/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,asterblasterth,7," I mean it's not perfect...

11 April 2022,JackDuckworthsTechnoPigeon,6," Ending? What ending?
","I enjoyed this initially. It was a reasonably decent storyline, it was watchable, it even had a few jump scenes in there. Then it seemed to slide. The situations became more illogical and nothing really seemed to happen or make any sense. Still, I persevered.",/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,ZinQ,5," I enjoyed it, but!

22 February 2022,wyattwhite3,9," Really Strong sofar
","Early on it's always hard to tell, but sofar From seems to walk the line between being a supernatural mystery show and an outright horror show.",/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2022,katiebugg-49971,7," Drew me in immediately...now I can't get enough
","I was bored feeling like I had seen every movie and every show especially when it comes to the thriller and horror genre. When I saw this show was on EPIX I don't know why but I thought, eh, low quality, lifetime type of show. Boy was I wrong. Similar feel to the show ""The Leftovers"". It's a unique story that hasn't been done before. The people standing outside of the windows truly gives you the creeps!! I also love the mystery aspect of how people show up in this weird little town. When I first started watching I thought wow a solid 8.5 show, but the reason I lowered the rating was due to the last episode. For some reason it got a little strange and confusing on the last episode. I'm super hopeful that this will continue to be a great series, but something tells me it will get weirder rather than better. I don't see how they can put all the puzzle pieces together neatly, but hey! I may be underestimating! Can't wait for season 2! I'll be sure to update my review after more seasons are released to give the show a fair and accurate rating.",/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2022,ecsecs-91225,4," I noticed 1 rating comments...
","I noticed 1 rating comments getting downvoted into oblivion. Doesn't mean they're wrong, I too am trying to like this show because the overall concept is very interesting. But the execution feels way off. Just too many plot points defying logic and common sense.",/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv

20 March 2022,staciarose20,8," I have a theory
","The creatures are all in older clothing from the 50's. There's even a milk man still in uniform. I think the town was cursed, or this vampire came to make them all like him. The special needs man was a little boy who managed to escape or hide. He's the oldest citizen because he lived there before everything went down. What I can't explain is why people from all over found their way into this loop of reality. No one ever leaves, like purgatory. Which we know the creators (of Lost) love to write about. I also can't explain the runes or how there are passages through trees. Maybe it is purgatory, or their version of hell. This show doesn't give answers.",/review/rw8536441/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2022,robhall_ie,6," Unbelievably frustrating
",Godammit the pretext of the series is very intriguing but the delivery is very annoying. I don't care about the people and their growing relationships.
