8 December 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," Level up.
","Even though its central concept seems ever-so-slightly more strained this time, 'Jumanji: The Next Level (2019)' is about as good as its predecessor. In fact, it's sometimes even better. Basically, the flick is just fun. The crowd-pleasing body-swapping is amped up to eleven, shaking things up just enough so that they feel fresh. The main actors continue to properly impress in their chameleon-like roles, joined by a few extra treats that perform far better than you'd perhaps expect. Indeed, these new players are probably its biggest asset; a couple of them thoroughly perforate the entire experience despite only having a rather small amount of screen-time. The picture is often funny - though, never hilarious - and is oddly endearing, to boot. It isn't particularly deep or, even, memorable but it doesn't need to be. It's a good time at the movies; what more do you need? Obviously some better theming and, perhaps, a tad of nuance wouldn't go amiss, but it's just not that kind of film really and that's perfectly fine. Even if it doesn't impact you as much as some of the year's best, it'll certainly make you smile and keep you entertained for a couple of hours. Besides, its inciting incident is driven purely by character and it even manages to squeeze some genuine emotional connection, via a well-drawn dynamic between DeVito and Glover, into its otherwise otherworldly proceedings. Its acting is also deceptively simple but decidedly fantastic, fully immersing you in the idea that these major stars are actually four teenagers and two old men. Basically, it's not as simple as you might think. 7/10",/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,boblipton,6," Who Does The Best Danny Devito Impression?
","I am very fond of the first iteration of JUMANJI, with Robin Williams giving a wonderful performance and the latest in CGI, which looks either quaintly charming or charmingly quaint a quarter of a century later. The remake a couple of years ago struck me as foolish before I saw it, but it turned into a highly amusing movie, with some favored performers. It made enough money that now it is a series. If they continue at this level, it will be a pleasant movie for me to see every couple of years.",/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2020,WooderIce64,7," Familiar, but Entertaining
","After the success of the sleeper hit Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, it was only a matter of time before a sequel got made. Jumanji: The Next Level is pretty much Welcome to the Jungle all over again. It's a fun movie, it's cleverly written, and that's about it. It covers many of the same beats, but it's still funny because the premise is something that can be used for a whole new set of different jokes and gags. Spencer goes back to Jumanji, and the others need to get him back. Only this time, Spencer's grandfather (Danny DeVito) and his business partner (Danny Glover) get sucked in too. At the beginning, Danny DeVito is in the Rock's body, Danny Glover in Kevin Hart, Fridge in Jack Black, and Martha returns to Karen Gillan.",/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2019,muamba_eats_toast,7," Enjoyable sequel
",I absolutely loved the first instalment and to a large extent those that enjoyed the first will enjoy this it's still entertaining fast paced and humerous. The only thing I found was rather than laughing out loud and being on the edge of my seat like the first I had the occasional chuckle sat back. Having said that laughing out loud or not I was never bored and still had a smile on my face for the majority of the film. A decent sequel exiting at in interesting point for a potential 3rd movie.,/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2019,Finfrosk86,7," More of the same, if that's good or bad is up to you
","I thought the last Jumanji movie was pretty decent, not perfect, but definitely not bad. If you liked that one you will like this. It is very much just more of the same. If it ain't broke, you know.",/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2019,quiqueperezsoler,8," Great sequel and laugh fest, the new Jumanji knows what its doing
","Mild, mild spoilers ahead....",/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2019,noahbetancourt,7," Satisfying sequal
","Surprised that this movie was good. Comparable to the first. The plot was the exact same thing as the first, but by adding new characters and switching up who's in who's body, it kept things fun and entertaining. Very funny, Kevin Hart was hysterical acting like Danny Glover, one of the highlights of the film. Unlike the first, this one had some good fight scene, and a few nice twists. Overall, just a fun entertaining movie. It doesn't stand above the first from 2017, not better not worse. If you didn't like the first, highly doubt you'll enjoy this one any more. But it's still funny for those entertained by the first.",/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2019,bob-the-movie-man,7," The Game Rebooted and just as fun.
","One of the pleasant movie surprises of Christmas 2017 for me was ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"". I expected it to be a tired retread of the original classic, but instead it turned into a highly entertaining action comedy. Reading my review again, I was rather po-faced about it and scored it with a rather measly 7/10. But this rather belies my secret love of the movie: it is a film that I can invariably watch and enjoy again and again.",/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2019,gluonpaul,8," Just a good old fashioned fun movie
",There are not many franchises which have been renewed recently which I have actually thought turned out well. Most have been done badly but I have to say that Jumanji stands out as an exception.,/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2019,natsuka_arei,8," Suprisingly, funnier than the first (imho)
","To be honest, I don't have high expectation for the sequel but turns out it is exceeded all of my expectations.",/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2020,bobbywell,7," Pleasant Surprise.
","I went into this movie expecting the normal sequel. You know, either a retread of the first or more inferior than the first.
This was neither. I felt it was just as strong as the first. Expanding the old characters and adding new ones.
What impressed me though was Kevin Hart and Duane Johnson being able to do the cadence of old men. They showed much more acting depth than I expected from them.
All in all a very enjoyable sequel.",/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2020,Mr-Fusion,7," Good reason to level up
","""Jumanji: The Next Level"" deserves praise for for not only reminding use why the first one was good, but also for its adept handling of sequel chores. It's back to the jungle but with more characters, good story and loads of charm. The slight bank towards zany is welcome here and makes for an easygoing and entertaining diversion after the holidays. To me, Jack Black is the standout for shouldering much of the humor, and I'm pleased to see a franchise being built on solid and heartfelt foundations.",/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2020,martinrobertson300482,7," Pretty good
","The last ""Jumanji"" movie came out of nowhere and ended up being really good. Despite me expecting it to be terrible.",/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2021,Hayden-86055,6," Rather forgettable sequel that just about manages to be entertaining
","Recycles lots from the first one, has a worse villain and the characters didn't seem as original this time round. Still worth a watch for the actors alone and there is some good jokes here but I wouldn't hold it in too high regard.",/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2019,saptesh786,5," First is better !
",It is not so impressive as previous one. Character transformation is some way working not for all. Only Eddie's turn into Rock is highlighted part. Movie lost charm when Spencer back in Rock. Then story remains nothing. However funny dialogues surely will entertain you. Otherwise rest of movie is bore. I think previous one was better an interesting.,/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2019,srdjan_veljkovic,5," Not as good as the first one
","It's OK, but, not nearly as good as the first one.",/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2019,BA_Harrison,5," Gillan is my business, and business is good (but the film is only average).
","The first Jumanji film, Welcome To The Jungle, was a lot of fun thanks to an amusing script, lots of entertaining state-of-the-art CG adventure action, and a great cast that included Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black and Kevin Hart. However, in my opinion, the best thing about the film was lovely Karen Gillan as Jumanji game avatar Ruby Roundhouse, a babelicious, kick-ass red-head in a skimpy outfit.",/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2019,aninspiration,8," Still amazing, more silly jokes and chaos on the screen!
","Before going to the cinema to see «The Next Level» of Jumanji, I rewatched the first movie, just to refresh my memory. And after watching the new one, I must say - it wasn't underwhelming at all!",/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2020,chrispule,7," Great Popcorn Film

7 December 2019,vengeance20,8," Not Bad
",Never knew a sequel was in the making & didn't think the first film needed one. But either way when I heard this was in the works I just had to see it!,/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2019,film_watcher_,6," Solid addition to the franchise.
","This was a fun time. The cast and performances are both very good here. It's a fun popcorn movie - although, there are some ""shocks"" and somewhat violent deaths throughout which I found jarring and a strange tone choice. However, this is a great bunch of likable comedy actors/young actors being given the freedom to have fun in these roles. There are also some exciting set-pieces and creative vfx. It was a wise choice to bring back the entire cast too, with some new additions. I'd recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a fun action-packed video game/blockbuster with likable and entertaining actors. But beware of the jump scares and ""scary"" animals if you're sensitive to that sort of thing.",/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2019,andrewchristianjr,8," NEXT LEVEL OF HUMOR, ACTING AND ACTION.
","Hillarious. Probably one of the funniest film of the year. Next level of humor, action and acting, feels like a real vg level design. Nice family flick.",/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2019,CallMeAi,8," This was HILARIOUS!
","I can't see how this movie was boring. You got the humor, the action, the excitement, the ACTING?! (and that ending tho...) This really was taken to the next level compared to the fist one. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's better. I don't know which I like better. The 2017 version is like the ""standard"" version of Jumanji introducing us to an amazing cast and filled with laughs. This movie builds on that concept and takes it further with a more diverse plot and new characters.
What I DID find dissapointing was that I felt that the fight with the villain was too short and over. But darn this movie was so FUNNY. I came out of the cinema with my stomach hurting because I laughed so much.",/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2020,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," A nice refreshing twist on the characters
","More acting skills were called upon with a nice refreshing twist on the characters, and the actors delivered. Wanted more humor, but nevertheless, a great sequel.",/review/rw5437303/?ref_=tt_urv
