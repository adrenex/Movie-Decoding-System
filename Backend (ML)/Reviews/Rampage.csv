30 December 2020,AdityaDev007,8," Make a REMAKE of it.
","The story could have been better it shouldn't have been ended in a rush like it did but still this anime holds a Special Place in my heart due to the love expressed by the characters and the story. The Protagonist and its love interest is one of the pairs in modern anime history. The love story is one of the best I've ever seen being a positive to most of the story I'll most probably don't complain from my perspective for its ending but from an average anime weeb perspective the ending was rushed.
But it's not a major concern from my perspective because some parts in the anime are so good that you will be forced to ignore its major plot holes and rushed ending. It's a go to watch from my opinion.
The Animation is so good for normal sceneary every frame is beautiful to be your desktop's wallpaper but action scenes are pretty average whether it's an mecha anime but it's major focus is on human relationships and love, Romance.
Music is also a good job for the anime the Opening, Ending Song and Background Music are well settled.",/review/rw7051195/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2018,shubhamm-79684,10," After thousands of hours of anime, this one takes the cake.
","While I have never written a review before, I felt incredibly compelled to do so after watching the most recent episode (15) as this has quickly rose to the top of my list of the dozens of animes I have watched.",/review/rw7051195/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2020,BadgerStorm4345,3," The Downfall of a Great Anime
","Darling in the Franxx started off great with its first 15 episodes, you can even make the case that 16-18 were also very good. The ball gets dropped so hard that it's sad to think that I once was attached emotionally to these characters. I was rooting for the final episodes to be over, not for the characters to survive. The series undeniably has great animation and music, as well as fantastic world building similar to showslike Evangelion or even The Promised Neverland, but they eventually started explaining things way too much in episode 19 and also never explaining anything else last that point. They destroyed my faith in the series finale before I watched it, and I was right to lose faith, the series finale is one of the worst episodes in anime, all the emotion is ruined by one ridiculous character design that is never explained in the slightest. Things start happening for no reason without any explanation and it kills the show's quality. Although a majority of Darling in the Franxx is still great, the last 5 episodes are atrocious.",/review/rw7051195/?ref_=tt_urv

22 July 2020,kwesib-32179,10," Deserves more
","At a first glance, one will be tempted into underestimating this series. Don't make that mistake; give the show a chance. It started slow but get through the first 5 episodes and you won't regret it.
The show started with weird characters only for them to really develop and envelop onto something new we never believed they would. The storyline begins plain and simple making you believe this show is not unique but continue to the end, and you will ponder on why there is no season 2. The animation is superb and high quality as well. What I like about this anime is that it will fool you with a cliche storyline only to evolve with a total different plot twist that we never expected. The ending will leave you in tears wanting for more. You realize that even though the show begins with a cliche, unoriginal and nothing unique plot at first, the tone over time changes into a darker tone and ends on a high note earning this show its own place among the many mecha animes.",/review/rw7051195/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2021,schanzaysohail,9," Great Execution, Thrilling Plot and Beauitful Animation
","At first I was really hesitating to watch this anime because almost everyone i knew told me that it had no plot and the only reason it actually had fans was because of Zero Two. I'm so happy i still decided to watch this anime...
The plot is written so well one of the best Sci-Fi Anime's iv'e ever watched. There was not even one single moment where i was bored of this anime and/or I wanted to watch something else. All i could wish for was this to never end while i was watching this.",/review/rw7051195/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2018,pickles-18893,10," It creates an atmosphere of deep conflict and in between are some stunning visuals and fight scenes.
","At first I was very skeptical for obvious reasons but once I got past my initial judgments of the outlandish visuals, I was able to recognize the stories true depth. The creator does in immaculate job as far as world building is concerned but I can see how many people overlook all the small details. Each episode raises many questions and you aren't presented with clear answers for quite some time. The story is put forth in such a way that really requires you to read in between the lines and it my opinion, that's what makes it so captivating. It creates an atmosphere of deep conflict and in between are some stunning visuals and fight scenes. It is not without faults but it is expertly written and worth the watch.",/review/rw7051195/?ref_=tt_urv

14 October 2020,renegadeviking-271-528568,7," DARLING in the FRANXX review
","Darling in the Franxx is an original anime by a collaboration between Trigger, A-1 pictures and CloverWorks. It has 24 episodes and aired over the Winter and Spring seasons in 2018. Elements of all three studios shine through the project in a variety of ways, especially along the lines of animation, drama and romantic themes, which are characteristically A-1 and CloverWorks. However, Trigger's presence in the Action, Sci-Fi and Mecha themes are prevalent and have a commanding presence that easily outshines its partners. This is why Darling is heavily considered another staple in Trigger's legacy and gets them most of the love...and the hate. However, we should keep in mind that this was a joint effort and the hard work and dedication of all three studios should be praised.",/review/rw7051195/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2022,martin_merelesc,8," A highly recommended wick darling
","Darling in the Franxx is an overrated mecha, for others is the greatest thing since sliced bread, for others is a wasted potential, for others it's just a mug anime who only fills in the season. For me is the glorification of true conservatism, where the family, community and environment are given their spaces to live in peace with each other; moreover, the central piece that makes love and later family is the much-needed remedy to a great quantity of ills that we currently. All in all, Darling in the Franxx's objective is not only glorifying our classic normal ways to live, rather serves a warning about a possible collapse of our current system that took us millennia to create and could be destroyed in mere weeks.",/review/rw7051195/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2018,gabrielmorenocorredor,10," DARLING is really impactful
","True that this anime is a bit slow but accomplishes the meaning of no matter what happens you will find something extraordinary, the whole show is one big masterpiece. which for me I liked it, because it reminded me from the HALO: LEGENDS movie the way It was animated and it really packs the punch. What more is I liked the relationships between each character, each person had someone who he/she liked. This show really does have drama, some Romance, and SCI-FI. Also give It a try you might be surprised.",/review/rw7051195/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2021,nosknut,8," Sticks its landing
","There is no reason to hide it. This is a square remake of Neon Genesis Evangelion without the iconic designs and art style. That being said, it does provide an above average story and an interesting dynamic between its characters. What stood out to me however is the ending. It ends the story. That's it. It just ends the story. The characters get a future they like, and the show ends up feeling complete. Many today underestimate the value of telling A story from beginning to end, and actually finishing it. When writing this i watched the last episode for the first time just a few minutes ago, and i feel like i can close the book. It was an experience i enjoyed, and the end made me remember it better than it probably was. One of the most difficult things to do in modern storytelling is sticking the landing, and DARLING in the FRANXX did this gracefully. Don't watch this show because it revolutionized something. Don't watch it because it poses critical questions about existence that haven't been asked a million times before. Watch it, so you for once can feel like something you started truly ended in the best way that it could. It will leave you with a joyful feeling of completeness and finality.",/review/rw7051195/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2020,badcgishark,3," A Poor Man's version of Evangelion with disgusting sexuality of minors
","Just an awful show. While the main two characters form an interesting pairing, there is no reason to slog through this trite, boring copy of Evangelion. What is worse is the absolutely abhorrent sexuality of minors with the positions that they are in while in the mechs...it's just awful. The multitude of mech type shows out there are better worth watching.",/review/rw7051195/?ref_=tt_urv
