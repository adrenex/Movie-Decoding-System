11 September 2022,pkpera,5," Really silly ratings here. What movie is, but not much
","I did not plan to write review of this movie, but seeing about 10 1-ns in row here (rated by usefulness or whatever), followed with rating 10 - made me to do it.",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,feelingthefhvibe,1," Awful, and not even in a fun way
","What drew me to the film was Brianna Hildebrand, having had conflicting opinions on her from her previous works and looking for a bit of a tie-breaker. What compelled me to write a review, though, was seeing the sharp split in the few reviews offered for the film. It looks like the divide is between people that watched it, and people that are trying to sell it, which is always a hoot.",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2022,Erick_Till,7," Original and charming film
",I believe that all people who ranked this movie as 1 urgently need a shrink. You can only see evil if there is evil within you.,/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2022,dkalloway,1," Every middle aged man's fantasy
","Brianna, girl, you deserve so much better than this. This could've easily been a fascinating story of her character's perspective of coming back to a world that has moved on. Instead it's a story of a mediocre white man who has such a TOUGH choice to make: does he further his career and live the life he's built with his wife? Or does he chase his dick and pursue an 18 year old in the most not creepy way as he attempts to ""free"" himself from the shackles of his current life. It's exactly cringey, if not more, than you expect. Many ""no's"" were screamed at the screen.",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,mannimario,7," Ignore the 1/10 & 10/10 ratings... See it
","My first advice...
Ignore the 1/10 & 10/10 ratings... See it for yourself.",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2022,LoftheB,1," Who thought this was a good idea?
","I'll admit that my initial interest was with the weird typecasting of Brianna Hildebrand in yet another role where she's time-travelling. The curse of having a baby-face, I suppose.",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2022,gazpacha,8," Grounded Science Fiction with a lot of heart
","Compelling performance by this young actress. I totally believed she was lost in this place of being treated like a kid by those who knew her before and not fitting in with the young people she was meeting now. So it made sense to me that she would want to connect with her former boyfriend even though he now ""looks old"".",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2022,itsabadmoviebruh,1," Not worth the time
","The premise (middle-aged man has a 'sci-fi' reason to get in a relationship with a teenager) was gross. The movie was incredibly predictable, charmless, and forgettable.",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2022,midnightisburning,1," A film for our time
","After a failed senatorial campaign, struggling politician Jack and his wife Maggie return to Jack's old, rural stomping ground for some much needed downtime. It's a place full of memories and people Jack grew up with, including it turns out, ""the one who got away""--very, very far away.",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2022,awfulpidgeon,1," Why are we still pitting women against each other?
","While the concept of this movie could have been interesting, the execution was bad and uncomfortable.",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2022,Pip_pip_pirrio,1," huh???
","What on earth was the point of this movie?? I've seen some positive reviews talking about how our main character is nostalgic, and conflicted, and relatable, and I'm just sitting here thinking: did we watch the same movie.",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2022,pndnthstrs,1," Boring and creepy
","NOTE: This is my second time posting this review. I first submitted a review on 6/14/2022 but it was mysteriously taken down without any notification. Read into that what you will! Also, since I have a second chance to add some thoughts here, I would also like to add that the audio and sound mixing in this movie are at times very bad.",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2022,lawelzig,10," Thought provoking movie with an amazingly talented cast!
",The Time Capsule is a movie for both the sci-fi movie fan and a romance movie fan!,/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2022,johnho-50288,10," I really enjoyed this movie
","There's some weird brigading going on in the reviews but here's my review from someone who watched it as a work of art rather than as a means to unrelated political statements. The movie tells the story of a politician who just lost a huge election and wonders what will make him happy. Here's where the sci fi premise comes in. His high school girlfriend just returned to earth after a failed attempt at colonizing another planet. Due to time dilation (a real, measurable phenomenon) she has barely aged while 20 years has gone by for Jack, the politician.",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2022,sayingnotobadmovies,1," Barely watchable
","Aside from the premise being... bad. Just. Objectively bad. Aside from that, though, the movie was painfully boring. It's pitched as sci-fi while having barely any sci-fi elements. It's pitched as romantic or comedic while the comedy is absent entirely and the romance only expressed in a deeply inappropriate relationship.",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2022,clocloco,10," Romantic Comedy with a twist
","What if? This sweet, quiet movie revolves around this eternal question. What if I did not lose, what if she did not leave.... How would my life be? It talks of missed opportunities, regrets and thanks to the sci fi twist, how you can get a second chance if you are brave enough to take the right decision. I loved the play on time with the 50s costumes and the futuristic cars. It adds to the nostalgia and the turmoil of emotions. I loved the carefully crafted dialogues and the talented cast (Kadee Strickland is phenomenal) This movie is very touching and very personal. The music matches the moods. In all, an unpretentious story telling about deep questions we all asked ourselves at one time or another. I enjoyed it very much and recommend it warmly.",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2022,itsstillabadmoviebruh,1," Boring and skeevy
","Aside from being incredibly boring, with shallow characters and slow pacing, the movie's premise was the stuff of middle-aged men's creepy fantasies. Time travel being used just so a guy in his 40s can get involved with a teenager? Gross. Gross, uninteresting, and unpleasant to watch.",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,malc-15597,9," A lovely movie just like The Lake House
",This reminds me very much of the The Lake House(2006) which is a wonderful romantic drama with lots of twists and turns. It left me in the same mood as that film so I'll certainly watch it again.,/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2022,seth-59671,10," Checkout this fun sci-fi rom-com with an original story!
","Writer director Erwann Marshall leverages an interesting premise to explore concepts around first loves, enduring friendships, compromises, second chances, and self rediscovery. Stars Todd Grinnell and Brianna Hildebrand skillfully navigate a complex and dynamic tension that successfully keeps the audience guessing. This is a thoughtful yet fun and touching movie that is definitely worth checking out!",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2022,mary-61518,10," Great movie!
","Finally something with a unique story line, GREAT acting and cinematography and a slightly different but happy ending. This is destined to become a classic, a relatable second chance at love story, for years to come.",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2022,hafthorsmoviereviews,1," Just bad
","I regret the time I spent watching this movie. The premise was pretty disgusting, but that aside, you're still left with the fundamental problems that the delivery was mediocre and the pacing was painful.",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,gord_muir,3," Skip it
","Bad writing, worse acting, just skip it and save yourself some pain.",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2022,bjlandier,10," Unique, funny, and deep. This movie was more than expected.
","A little bit of sci-fi, romance, and comedy makes for a movie that's not only worth watching, but it will make you think... What would you do for true love? What if you had a second chance?",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,caughc,10," Should you watch this movie?? F@#$ Yeah!!
","As a sci-fi fan, I really enjoyed this movie because of its unique and creative use of time dilation and how it could impact a world not too different from our own. It is a refreshing departure from the formulaic and predictable sci-fi movies of today that rely on big budget special effects instead of an original and compelling story. I'll take a man-made meteor shower any day over some space explosion we've seen a million times!",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,zealous_twilight,," True Love
","This movie is about True Love and what you would do to get it back. Not sure why people chose this movie to point out age difference. There are so many other movies with lager age gaps here's a few:
Entrapment - Catherine Zeta-Jones 29 / Sean Connery 68
Lost in Translation-Scarlett Johansson 18 / Bill Murray was 52
Something's Gotta Give - Amanda Peet 31 / Jack Nicholson - 66
The Man Who Wasn't There - Johansson 16 / Billy Bob Thornton 46
Poison Ivy - Drew Barrymore 17 / Tom Skerritt 58
Shopgirl,-Claire Danes / Steve Martin Age difference: 34 years
Most of the great actors and actress are up there in age a their counterparts are going to be much younger. Jack Nicholson 1937
Sean Connery 1930 to name a few. Oh and Elvis.",/review/rw8530486/?ref_=tt_urv
