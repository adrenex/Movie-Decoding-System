15 August 2013,blanche-2,10," Old age isn't for sissies, and it's hell on old opera stars
","""Quartet"" is a beautiful film directed by Dustin Hoffman, about a retirement home for musicians as the residents prepare for a benefit concert to keep the place going.",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2012,richard-1967,9," In Dustin's debut, not a single false note
","What remarkable good fortune that Dustin Hoffman chose this Ronald Harwood play (and screenplay) for his directorial debut at age 75. This is a movie for actors, and there are many terrific performances in this wonderful ensemble piece about the residents of a home for aging musicians, which we saw at our movie preview club.",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2013,EephusPitch,7," The Sunshine Boys, Merchant Ivory style
","This is the sort of film I normally strenuously go out of my way to avoid: the feel-good movie, especially the feel-good movie (Billy Elliot comes to mind) in which characters find ""redemption"" and ""meaning"" through Art. As a rule, the Brits do this kind of film much better (Brassed Off, the Full Monty) than Hollywood (no examples I would care to cite, I haven't had my breakfast yet); this is a hybrid, being a British written and produced movie, with an American director (Dustin Hoffman) making his directorial debut at the tender age of 74.",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2015,bryank-04844,8," With its stellar cast, charming characters, witty dialogue, and amazing music ranging from The Mikado to the Rigoletto, 'Quartet' is not to be missed.
","'Quartet' marks the directing debut for Dustin Hoffman, who is now five years shy of 80, and the two make a great pairing, just like a good wine and cheese. Hoffman took his cues from Ronald Harwood's play and from a documentary from the 80s that showcased a retirement home for famous musicians and singers. With its stellar cast, charming characters, witty dialogue, and amazing music ranging from The Mikado to the Rigoletto, 'Quartet' is not to be missed.",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2012,diane-34,10," How refreshing to see ageing treated so well
","Yesterday afternoon was pure joy because Diane and I watched Hoffman's directorial d√©but of a delightful movie that showcases some of the best in British acting. Superficially the subject matter would seem to be less than enthralling: an old folk's home putting on an end of year concert to raise money to keep the home working. Ha, the devil is in the details and these details set the entire story on a different plane of reality; this home is exclusively for retired concert musicians both orchestral and operatic. The level of professional attainment means that the audience for this ""end of year finale"" can attract people that will pay Covent Garden prices to attend such a stellar concert. The movie's casting is remarkable because the person that carries the show is Billy Connelly who enlivens the interaction with staff and residents to a degree that only his repartee can produce. Suffice it to say that his banter means that, for an old guy like me, there is never a dull spot in the movie. The drama is interjected by Maggie Smith who does it with the aplomb for which she is known. I also think that Dustin Hoffman did a remarkable job in this, his first, outing as a director. Diane and I both believe that this is a hugely enjoyable movie and should be seen by any person interested in the art of film making.",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2013,CelluloidRamblings,7," Pleasantly surprised.
","As a 16 year old, it's safe to say that this obviously is not a film which is aimed at me at all, being based in a retirement home for old musicians where cracking jokes about opera is, you know, hilarious. In fact, the screening I was in was filled with those with white hair. It's not often that I feel out of place at a cinema, but I on this occasion I did.",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2012,misspaddylee,," A wonderful ensemble piece
","""Quartet"" is the filmization of Ronald Harwood's 1999 play with the screenplay by the author. The story is set in a retirement home for musicians named for Sir Thomas Beecham. Plans are underway for the annual concert fundraiser to coincide with Verdi's birthday. Heading the gala committee is Cedric played by Michael Gambon. Kudos to Mr. Gambon for rocking the caftan like no one since George Zucco in ""Tarzan and the Mermaids"". One of Cedric's committee members is soprano Cissy played by the delightful Pauline Collins. Cissy is a ""getting worse"" in that her memory is failing. Her old stage partner Wilfred is the resident naughty man of the home played by Billy Connolly in his familiar raucous way. Wilfred delights in flirting outrageously with all the women and needling Cedric. The more sedate Reg played by Tom Courtenay came to the home to check on Wilf who had been admitted after a slight stroke. Here Reg found his niche in caring for his friends and holding classes for young people.",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2012,jimcheva,10," A sure-footed and moving debut.
","There are two obvious reasons to see this film. One is that it's Dustin Hoffman's directing debut. The other is that any film with Billy Connolly, Tom Courtenay, Maggie Smith and Michael Gambon is very unlikely to be less than very good.",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2013,planktonrules,9," Quite enjoyable and in some ways a bit like ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"".
","Warning: Despite the name being the same, this has no relation to the film by Somerset Maugham.",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2013,selffamily,10," Pure Joy
","My daughters and I ventured into post-festive cinema experience, and waded though queues of elderly people, obviously taking advantage of the chance to see a film that they could relate to, the queen being the only octogenarian known to leap from helicopters in this day and age. What we found was that, despite the endless trailers and publicity, there lurked a decent film, with skilled and talented cast and beautiful music, in a splendid setting, telling a nice story. Because that's what it is: a nice story. The various characters don't matter - they were all executed with stunning reliability - and musical numbers from Flanagan and Allen (no, Andrew Sachs was NOT either of those)via the Mikado (three very unlikely little maids)to the quartet from Rigoletto. The dialogue was witty and the moments thought-provoking. Even the wealthy and famous have to age and die, but to be able to end ones days in such surroundings must make it all worthwhile. Kudos to Dustin Hoffman (but how hard could it have been?) and to all who worked on what is ultimately a work of art.",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2012,sevavsnaruto,10," A Rare gem, truly a masterpiece!!!!!!!!!
","I saw this in Savannah (Film Festival), with a crowd that was averaging 50 and above. Everybody was laughing through out the whole picture, when I came out of the theater everybody only said nice things about it, I have never seen so many old people come out of a theater so happy!!!",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2013,IndustriousAngel,7," Very nice feel-good ""comedy""
","Well, speak of the devil - just the other year I asked my lady-friend ""whatever became of Dustin Hoffman?"" - and here he is with his first work as director. And it's a really nice film, too! A nursing home for retired musicians, situated in the lush landscape of rural England, forms the refined stage for this adapted play. The financial future of said home depends on the success of the yearly gala concert to honor Verdi's birthday, and if you think you can guess the script from this description you're probably right since the story unfolds in a pretty formulaic way, no, thank you, no risk with my tea today. A love-gone-wrong, a little jealousy, health problems are thrown at our wrinkled protagonists but nothing can avert the happy outcome! Though formulaic, I'll recommend this film: The acting is very fine, the comedy is well-timed, and the music is very good. Plus, it manages to stay on the healthy side of sentimental, it's absolutely no tear-jerker. And stay for the end credits!",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2012,lui-samantha,7," Veteran actors are the stars of this film
","After years of acting and two Oscars under his belt, Dustin Hoffman finally takes a turn behind the camera in his directorial debut for Quartet. ",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2013,larrys3,10," Wonderful & Superlative
","It's rare these days, in my opinion, to get a combination on superb acting, impeccable writing, and sensitive direction, all adding up to a superlative movie. However, that's what I found here.",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2013,TheLittleSongbird,10," Dustin Hoffmann's directorial debut, and a truly fine one at that
","I got much pleasure from watching Quartet, that promised much considering the talent involved and delivered equally so. I had a hope that it would be a good contrast to the truly impressive and interesting- if lengthy(and perhaps for some a little too stolid and talky)- Lincoln the night before, and be perhaps more accessible, and I was right on both counts. Quartet looks absolutely beautiful for starters, being elegantly shot with some of the most gorgeous scenery of any movie I've seen recently. And I wouldn't mind living in a home, splendid and warm and very like a character itself, like that when I'm a retired musician. The music is a pleasing mixture of lovely music hall numbers, classical music that is both relaxing and beautifully played and operatic favourites(especially the Rigoletto quartet, the La Traviata Brindisi is also very infectious). Quartet marks actor Dustin Hoffmann's directorial debut, judging from the skill and subtlety of his direction- without any mawkish sentimentality- you wouldn't think it was a debut. The script ideally balances subtle wit, with Billy Connolly, and affecting pathos, with Tom Courtenay and Maggie Smith. The story doesn't break any new ground, nor did it need to, but it just flies by and is constantly entertaining and easy to be touched by. The acting is just terrific, all of whom are cast in roles that suit them down to a tee. Tom Courtenay gives a very nuanced performance that made me identify with him without the film telling me to, while Maggie Smith, tormented yet with pride, is every bit the ex-opera star with a past. Billy Connolly is more restrained than usual, but he is very funny helped with the bulk of the script's best lines, and Pauline Collins' light-hearted and bubbly Cissy comes close to stealing the show in places. Michael Gambon is deliciously gruff and authoritative with no signs of over-egging it. Any opera fans will be delighted also in the appearance of Dame Gwyneth Jones, who even gives a quite poignant and even personal rendition of Vissi D'Arte from Tosca. Overall, a delightful film with the cast on top form and Hoffmann's direction truly remarkable and promising. 10/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2013,TxMike,," Sweet comedy about a retirement home for professional musicians.
",This was directed by the great actor Dustin Hoffman. When I checked I was surprised to see this is his first feature length movie as director. The result is great and judging from the comments in the DVD extras the veteran British actors found him super to work with.,/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2013,p-stepien,6," A rare feast of positivity regarding ageing
","Set in a British retirement home for ageing musicians, Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut is a well-crafted drama, which deters away from negativity to focus on the bright side of elder life. Partly a homage to opera and music in general, it always serves as a swansong for those artists, who fade away forgotten by the passing time. Featuring a multitude of real-life famed English musicians, ""Quartet"" breathers life and significance with its delicate and graceful touch.",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2012,jennysquib,10," Strong, subtle, moving - just beautiful
","It isn't often one can say ""I loved every moment"", but for this film it's true! Never for an instant does Dustin Hoffman stray into overwrought drama, mawkishness or bathos: his direction is restrained and subtle, there is humour a-plenty, yet the film packs a powerful emotional punch. And with a cast like that, how could he lose? And that's not just the stars, although they create wonderfully satisfying characters: the ""minor"" characters are also perfectly realised. Plus, the settings!!!! I felt like rushing off to make a booking at Beecham's for my old age! With such a great ensemble cast we are well-served, though for me, Pauline Collins was a stand-out - funny and so touching. I think I'd like to see it again.",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2013,Dr_Coulardeau,10," He knows what it takes to be eternal
","Only the BBC and Great Britain could produce such a film on retired musical artists, mostly musicians and opera singers. They are not guaranteed a long, slow and inactive aging period leading to their eventual dismissal but they are expected to go on practicing their arts, singing and playing, together if possible? and performing a few times a year to remain active and hence not simply survive but still create, produce, and enrich their collective lot, not out of pity or from charity from the public but because they provide that public with all kinds of real services, classes, lectures, concerts, etc.",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv

7 November 2013,xina2010,8," Brava!
","I cried tears of joy at the end of this wonderful movie. The acting, the sets, the country side and most of all, the story. This comedy-drama revolves around a home for retired musicians, patterned after the real-life Casa di Riposo per Musicisti founded by Giuseppe Verdi. The annual concert to celebrate Verdi's birthday is disrupted by the arrival of Jean, an eternal diva and the former wife of one of the residents. Maggie Smith is a remarkable actor, and she is at her finest here. Michael Gambon has the most intense air about him, Pauline Collins is a delight to watch and, of course, Bill Connolly is a wee bit over the top here, though a delight to watch as well. This is a beautiful story, told by many talented actors and it deserves to be seen. Brava!",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2017,SimonJack,6," Having fun with the talented in retirement
","""Quartet"" is a good British comedy with a cast of some of the great British actors of the last half of the 20th century. The film is based on a play and was the first credited directing job for Dustin Hoffman. The story has wonderful potential, but somehow the movie seems to miss the second gear that would give it some oomph. ",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2014,irwanjuanda_ndson,8," Enchanting, Wondrous, Spellbinding.
","First of all, I wish this is more popular in my country. This movie has a lot to share in its story and characters. While watching, you'll get flashbacks and flashforwards (if this word even exists) about your own life. It'll give you very many new perspectives about life, about the past, the present, and the future. Of course, without making you feel desperate and stressed.",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2013,JohnRayPeterson,7," A pleasant light comedy, good and safe debut for director Dustin Hoffman
","This was the two time Oscar winning actor Dustin Hoffman's debut as director and he played it safe, if that's what he was going for, by picking a successful play by fame writer Ronald Harwood who also wrote the screen adaptation. Hoffman, who is well known for his meticulous and focused approach to acting, no doubt approached this new project with the same diligence, and who better to have in one's cast than well established and consummate professionals like the key players, if you're aiming for outstanding results. Well, he succeeded; there is little we can fault 'Quartet' with except one detail which I'll mention a little further down. So bravo director Hoffman.",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2019,shakercoola,6," Gentle, lighthearted and plush drama with sugary honesty
","A British comedy; A story about retirement home for retired classic musicians and the arrival of a grande dame who throws preparations for a concert into chaos as egos clash and old resentments surface. This film may not be entirely convincing in its casting of Billy Connolly and others as opera stars of the past, but it more than makes up for it by their performances, their individual appeal and good humour. Including real life stars as fictional residents was a nice touch too. The tasteful hallways and immaculate grounds resound with the musical pieces. Essentially, it has a theme about the difficulty of leaving past glories behind and enjoying what keeps one young - the shared love of an art form and a faith in the future. Like many musical films of the past the putting-on-a-show premise is the main story. This tends to drown out the impetus for more in depth character analysis but there is enough to satisfy.",/review/rw4578262/?ref_=tt_urv
