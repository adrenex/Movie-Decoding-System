10 July 2020,cherold,9," Terrifically entertaining with a great performance by Fanning
","While apparently even historically inaccurate compared to an old Marlene Dietrich movie, The Great is a fantastically entertaining piece of nonsense with Elle Fanning giving a quirky, very funny performance as Catherine and Nicholas Hoult giving a funny, infuriating one as Peter (also a shout out to Phoebe Fox's snarky servant).",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2020,Kirpianuscus,," provocative
","For many reasons, shocking. For humor, for the clash with different biographic films (artistic or documentaries ) about Catherine the Great, for the less attention to historical accuracy and for Nicholas Hoult in a role too far by what you know. but , episode by episode, it becomes coherent, nice and real inspired. And the performances, the clothes, the atmosphere are keys for enjoy this great and eccentric, in profound sense, good crafted serie.",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2021,o_oraculo,10," It's a comedy, you effing nitwits!
","It's obviously a comedy! How can anyone give this series a bad rating based on it not being historically accurate is beyond me. People should be required to do an IQ test before their opinions are counted, and this should be required for voting in elections as well.",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2021,ianlouisiana,10," An absurdist masterpiece.Rude,crude and very very funny....
","Were the roots of Feminism nurtured in the Emperor's Court?Thought not.
For Heaven's sake how could anyone take this seriously?
It's as fictional as 'The Crown' and a hell of a lot funnier.
Brilliant comic performances are wrung from the cast with Miss P Fox doing the best scene - stealing act since Alan Rickman in 'Robin Hood'
Hugely impressive production values.
Not for the po - faced certainly but the humour ranges from the rapier to the bludgeon with mesmerising speed.
This sets the bar very high for TV comedy in 2021.",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2021,Almost_Soldout,9," This made me laugh a lot this weekend!
","The way how they play and remastering the history is genius! As being Russian, I find this show absurdly brilliant and funny. That's interesting to follow how the show is portraying current narratives with well known facts from 18 century, as it all together creates absolutely masterpiece satire Universe!",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2020,randall-alyssa,10," Inaccurate and Thrilling
","I love the history of Catherine the Great, and this isn't it. However it is hilarious, smart, sarcastic, and almost resembling her story.",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2020,atfgovedarica-84321,10," Huzzah! I want season 2
","This has been one of the best shows of the year. I binged watched it over the weekend and it was great. It is loosely based on history but has an entertaining twist and the ending cries for a second season. Elle Fanning does a great job as well as the other characters. Some you immediately like, some you hate but all of them grow on you as the season progresses.",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2020,darthsteele-39338,9," Sadly, it seems many viewers don't get it.
","A satirical show poking fun at shows like The Tudors and so many others in this genre. A whimsical telling of the story of history's Catherine the Great. Judging by the negative reviews, it seems some people just don't get what this show is. The only reason I did not give it a 10 is because at times the show can switch from comedy satire to full on drama. It's a little inconsistent.",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2021,johannes2000-1,10," Spicy and hilarious, this is entertainment of the highest level!
","I loved it. It gives you the best of two worlds: on the one hand a lavish romantic history-based story, chockfull of schemes and intrigues, dazzling palaces and luscious costumes; on the other hand a hilarious, high-paced and very spicy comedy. Showing the funny disclaimer (""Un occasionally true story"") directly next to the title ""The Great"" cleverly takes all the wind out of the sails of all these nasty know-it-alls who revel in pointing out every historical fault or inaccuracy. Because, come on, who cares, when this wonderful enticing show is the result!",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2020,TruthPhoenix,8," Funny and Refreshing
","Underneath the silliness, it is quite smart. Great acting as well. Check it out for a fun time. :)",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2020,UniqueParticle,9," Hard to watch but incredibly well made
","The writing is exquisite, so is set designs/clothes, and acting is impeccable! The relationship between the empress and emperor really frustrates me I hope it improves from the pilot. I absolutely love the silliness and beauty throughout! Elle Fanning is magnificent I've enjoyed many of her roles since she was little.",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2020,mosquitobite,10," absolutely loving this
","Terrific fun Nicholas Hoult is adorable and Elle is on pitch. A great COVID binge, get on it im giving it ten coz it's cheering me up :)",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2021,henrycoles9,10," Huzzah-proarious!
","Peter is a megalomaniac Russian emperor who only cares about the four F's of carnal life. Catherine is a German girl infatuated with Russia and modernity. She's also his disillusioned wife who wants to take over his throne and create the modern, free Russia she's always envisioned. And this makes for a totally hilarious story of life in the court of Peter, for everyone from the serfs and servants to the nobility and royal couple. Excellent comedy.",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2021,MissSimonetta,4," Shock value is so tiresome
","Considering that the hilariously inaccurate REIGN is a guilty pleasure of mine, I'm not going to fault THE GREAT for any lapses in historical presentation. However, if you're going to make a comedy about Catherine the Great, can it please have more wit beyond vulgar sex jokes and rampant cussing? Those two elements stopped being shocking around the 1990s. It's so commonplace in media now that it just feels tired, not risque or funny.",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2020,mageh,9," Cute, funny and entertaining!
","Yes, historically inaccurate, but very fun to watch. Don't take it seriously, it is not a history lesson, it is just fun show. Great acting and lighthearted comedy.",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2020,cjenkinson-66190,10," LOVED IT!!
","This was so enjoyable to watch! It really did have a little bit of everything.. comedy, romance, history and heart! Very entertaining, great story telling, beautiful costumes and sets!
Your binge watching dreams have come true!
Bring on season 2 please as quickly as possible!!",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2020,altereggo123,2," Painfully unfunny. Not good drama or history either. So what's the point?
","This production is pretty to look at-beautiful sets, great cast--but the dialogue... I am four episodes in and groping for something to find amusing. It's clearly not intended to be taken seriously, but it's pretty thin as comedy. The screenwriters' idea of wit and humor is to have Peter III (Catherine's husband) and others say ""F-k"" (or variations on that) about twenty times in every scene. Yes, we get by episode 1 that he's a cruel dolt surrounded by sycophants, no need to demonstrate it over and over again without subtlety. The adultery and rape jokes grow tiresome. Including the word ""Huzzah"" a million times does not make the characters sound more authentic. Peter the III wasn't Peter the Great's son, notwithstanding a running theme about his inability to live up to his father, one of many wild inaccuracies, so when the writers admit that not much of the story is necessarily true, they understate the matter. Almost every single thing is made up, and not cleverly. There is palace intrigue as in all royal melodramas, and good production values, but overall the show is tasteless and vapid. If only the script were as smart as the costumes.",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2020,2siamese,9," Worth watching!
","Quirky humour, great acting, certainly not trying to be historically accurate! Possibly the humour isn't slapstick enough for the initial reviewers. It's definitely worth the watch.",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2020,Azanspy,8," Elle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult is a treat to watch.
","The Great is actually great. The series is driven by spectacular performances, production and some witty humour. I don't know how much of the plot is true to the historical facts but Tony McNamara did a good job on this show after the mind blowing movie, The Favourite. The cast is excellent and Elle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult did a riot. I couldn't pick who was great between them because both were performing well on par. Overall, The Great is a pretty good limited series to watch and have fun.",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2020,Coralknight,1," A historic comedy that asks the difficult questions...
","...such as who could possibly think this was a good idea? Anyone who has an interest in historic pieces is by nature higher in intellect than someone who spends their day watching Tik-tok videos, which is why this horrible, crude farce with no redeeming historic or comedic value makes me scratch my head. There's nothing in it for history buffs (of any ages). The humor is very low-grade (just above fart jokes, but well below anything that would make you think). So, why put all the time and effort into something when the humor and plot overall is so dull and dim-witted? Just doesn't make any sense.",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2020,saadgkhan,7," Witty fictional satire with PC forced inclusion
",The Great - B+ (Memorable),/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2021,westsideschl,10," Kudos to Elle
","From what I can tell it's a fairly accurate, at times humorous (even the more dramatic events), accounting of an intelligent forward thinking woman's (Catherine) rise to power in late 18th century Russia. Burlesque-like. Fanning's acting was also quite good. Age appropriate rating warning: Sex is mentioned often, but little seen. However, food, drink & bawdy behavior seen aplenty.",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2020,staciarose20,8," It changes course.
","This show can be funny, vulgar, raunchy, and ridiculous, but by the end it took a more serious tone. Not your typical period piece. This isn't all starched collars and roses. My opinion on all of the characters changed throughout the ten episodes, and that's what surprised me about it the most. Beautiful filming location as well. I will be watching season 2 if it's renewed.",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2020,Katy090,10," Loved it!
","There better be a season two on the way, because this has been one of the most entertaining series I have seen in years. Very well written and the acting is some of the best I've seen on any tv series.",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2021,prashant-63677,1," The world is getting dumber.
","Unfortunately i watched this trash right after i had finished watching a classic series wolfhall. I was stunned into a painful silence by this clownish, comic, poorly directed, poorly acted, poorly scripted monstrosity. I shut this trash down after just 20 minutes of torture. But I am genuinely concerned as to who is the target audience for this comic debacle? Who do the makers intend this for? And who has voted fir this garbage with such aplomb? Its painful to imagine. The world is just getting dumber i guess. Instead of The Tudors, Wolfhall we should expect this clownish interpretation of events & historical figures. Sad.",/review/rw7035334/?ref_=tt_urv
