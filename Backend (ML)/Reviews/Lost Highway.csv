","A widow 'of a certain age', Nancy (not her real name) books a hotel room and a fit young sex worker, Leo Grande (not his real name). Nancy never had an orgasm during thirty-one years of married life, so she has some catching up to do.",/review/rw8253195/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2022,kosmasp,10," Let's talk about ... sex(?)
","This played at the sneak preview the other night. And it was a delight. Not sure what people were expecting, but the fact that no one left the theatre is a good sign. You never know what you get, but there is always someone who will walk out at these events.",/review/rw8253195/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,quietneeded,10," Amazing
",I totally think Emma Thompson should win an award for this movie. This movie touches on very very delicate subjects that we don't like to discuss. Especially about older people who want to still feel sexual and alive. They're able to take a very delicate subject and turn it into an enlightening one. Especially about people over 40 who don't ask for what they want because they don't think we should. She is one brave woman to take on this role!!,/review/rw8253195/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2022,sciencguy,8," A courageous performance by Emma Thompson
","Why did I have to stumble upon this movie on Prime instead of seeing critics tout it on their platforms? A bravura performance by Emma Thompson in a 'small' character-driven movie that makes every superhero or thriller film look amateurish by comparison. Maybe I'm just partial to intelligent dialogue and rational, original plots. I have to wonder what Thompson's thought process was in deciding to take on this role. It can't have been easy for her, at age 63. Courageous! Daryl McCormack turns in an outstanding performance as a sex worker whose gentle professionalism and sensitivity is meant to set the retired teacher at ease. Highly recommended!",/review/rw8253195/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,HelloBlockbuster,9," Surprisingly Refreshing
","Okay, I've *never* seen a movie like this one. (Literally only five actors in it, and two only have like one line each. There are only two filming locations: a hotel room and a hotel restaurant with the five actors.)",/review/rw8253195/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2022,Xstal,7," The Therapeutic Gigolo...
","It's time to take the plunge, and try stuff out, for years you've been unable to, checkout, so you're hiring a man, a metaphorical kind of fan, to raise a flame of which you have, a little doubt. When you meet it all seems like a bad idea, you're quite anxious, with a little bit of fear, should he stay or should he go, there are things you want to know, so you talk a lot, it's all very sincere. Extra couplings are arranged over the weeks, finding more than what you thought you had to seek, it's a therapeutic weave, and you finally achieve, to walk away as if you've just started to peak.",/review/rw8253195/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2022,EUyeshima,8," An Empirically Fine Two-Hander Focused on Self-Love
","Emma Thompson gives a very brave performance as a repressed sixtyish widow who decides to hire a professional escort to make up for the unfulfilling sex life she had when she was married. Fueled by Thompson's spiky intelligence and keen timing, it quickly moves from a comic exploration of female sexuality into an honest depiction of self-love and what prevents us from getting there. That dynamic also includes the escort (portrayed with polished compassion by Daryl McCormack) who unapologetically does his job on regular time-stamped appointments. Except for the appearance of a minor character late in the movie, this is a two-hander (sort of speak) that runs only 97 minutes. However. Katy Brand's perceptive screenplay and Sophie Hyde's sensitive direction manage the brevity with ease by highlighting the two stellar performances at the movie's core.",/review/rw8253195/?ref_=tt_urv

",Holy smokes. Amazing actors in this movie! I'm super picky! See my list.. it's all good stuff!. At first while reading the description of this I thought no thanks. But so glad I gave it a chance!

16 June 2022,ferguson-6,7," Nancy's checklist
","Greetings again from the darkness. Normally when we see a movie where the focus is almost entirely on two characters conversing while in one room, we expect it to feel like something better served in live theater. But director Sophie Hyde does succeed in keeping it cinematic, despite the dialogue-centric script from writer Katy Brand and a setting that is 95 percent within the confines of a single hotel room. An extraordinary performance from two-time Oscar winner Emma Thompson and solid complimentary work from Daryl McCormack keep us interested in the characters.",/review/rw8253195/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2022,dlsaltzberg,9," OMG, this was amazing
","People who write, ""Emma wasn't sexy enough"" are missing the point. EVERYONE should love their bodies and the pleasure that can be had, physical and emotional, with or without other people.",/review/rw8253195/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,jp_91,10," Emma Thompson is awesome!
","""Good Luck for You, Leo Grande"" is an exceptionally scripted movie that mixes drama with comedy. The dramatic element is quite effective, telling the sexual life of a middle-aged woman and her counterpart: a young gigolo, all with a great realistic load. The comedy is quite intellectual, moving away from silly jokes or absurd phrases. Among the themes used in the film are some current taboos such as sexual practice at a mature age of a woman or the female orgasm, all performed in a fine and sentimental way by the screenwriter Katy Brand. The performances of both protagonists are superb, Emma Thompson gives an acting class with a round character full of nuances, while the actor Daryl McCormack shows that he is a great young actor with a very promising future. The director Sophie Hyde did an amazing job, masterfully guiding the protagonists and her crew, it should be noted that her direction in the erotic scenes is totally artistic. One of the best movies of the year, if not the best!",/review/rw8253195/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2022,mekjd,7," Only Connect
","So well acted. In the hands of clumsy performers, this script would be horrifying. But it wasn't and so it isn't. When we want sex there are always other hungers, other flavors that we desire. A widow seeks adventure, a sex worker seeks affirmation, perhaps praise that was never freely given. All in all a ""feel good"" movie in more ways than one.",/review/rw8253195/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2022,and_shove_it_up_your_butt,9," LOVED It!
","Excellent! Emma Thompson is astounding in her role as Nancy Stokes. As an aside, I struggled throughout the movie to see her as a woman in her 60's. Upon first glance I assumed she was in her later 40's or early 50's. Either way, she's a beautiful woman and I'm so glad she chose to play this part. Daryl McCormack is so sexy it hurts and I love the subtle nuances he brought to the role of Leo. From the beginning there was something behind his eyes and in his mannerisms that indicated inner turmoil and rawness.",/review/rw8253195/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is at its best when the two leads are talking and revealing their innermost selves to each other. The acting is very good, the writing generally good with sensitive direction.",/review/rw8253195/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2022,dirk_and,9," Actually original!
","A truly original movie in a day and age where formulaic crap dominates. If you are prudish, this is not for you. The whole movie is about an older woman's interaction with a male sex worker so it is certainly not appropriate for all viewers, but such a well written and well acted movie that I actually came here to write a review. Well worth taking the time to watch this.",/review/rw8253195/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2022,jeroduptown,3," Misguided Leo
","Emma's a great actress - and McCormack holds his own. But the premise of the movie, that pleasure is the pinnacle of happiness (and that sex workers are doing everyone a favor) is silly. The connection that they built, especially through sharing their pain, was cheapened by an implied answer that pleasure is found within yourself. They should've fast forwarded another year and shown Emma as still unhappy and lonely. I know my opinion will be an unpopular one - but when you have a moment to teach something true using talent like this, you'd better check that the message is one that's actually helpful.",/review/rw8253195/?ref_=tt_urv

","Good luck to You, Leo Grande is the story of a lonely and aging woman who hires a prostitute to fulfill her mental and sexual desires.
