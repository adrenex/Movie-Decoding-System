11 February 2014,classicalsteve,6," Critically-Acclaimed Film with Outstanding Performances Left Me Surprisingly Cold
","This is one of those films which the critics were nearly-unanimous in offering universal praise and yet audiences seemed to be relatively dismissive. (The film didn't quite make back its money at the box office.) The performances of Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Hoffman, and the rest of the cast were outstanding, along with the dialog which seems perfectly suited to its characters. Even the sets of the late 1940's and early 1950's were superb. And there are a number of surprising moments in which you don't know where the story is headed. However, by the film's end, I felt like there was something missing, as if the filmmakers were reluctant to take a risk with the material and say something about their subject through the story. About the last half of the film, the story meanders and never finds again its pace or goal.",/review/rw2706782/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2013,bob the moo,," Looks stunning, wonderfully acted but the story-telling is weak and gradually loses any momentum it may have had
","I came into The Master knowing almost nothing about it and, knowing (and caring) almost nothing about Scientology, it transpires that I may not have been able to take as much from it as someone going in fully informed and ready to be led by the director. I say this upfront because I have noticed that generally, criticism of this film tends to be met with a snobby dismissal of the individual who didn't ""get it"" because they weren't smart enough etc. This said, the film started well and it engaged me for well over the first half, building characters and exploring them in a patience rhythmic manner that mirrors the hypnotic delivery of Dodd himself. Sadly this build doesn't have a delivery to speak of and in the second half of the film it really did lose me.",/review/rw2706782/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2012,jzappa,9," This is extremely difficult for me. Let me just start.
","Yes, herein contains some of the most ravishing filmmaking of the new millennium. The period details are abstract yet precise. The score has a stark, primordial allure. It's post-WWII America: Psychologically scarred veterans attempt to cramp themselves back into society. One is loner Freddie Quell, adrift in emotional confusion. He's secured a gig as a portrait photographer at a lavish department store imagined like a temple of indulgent commercialism. But Freddie doesn't last long there. In the darkroom, he screws models and chugs rotgut he makes with photo chemicals. Ultimately, he loses it on a customer, not just hitting him but harassing and lambasting him, working out some indecipherable, irrepressible rage.",/review/rw2706782/?ref_=tt_urv

","I will never understand how Phoenix and Hoffman didn't win the Oscars. Specially Joaquin, I truly think it is the best actor performance I ever watched in my life. The movie is great, although is not for everyone, you must watch it with the right mindset and pay attention to every detail. Most new actors should watch this movie to take notes on how to be a better actor. Cheers.",/review/rw2706782/?ref_=tt_urv

","Calling the performances great would be an understatement and wouldn't do the movie justice. Also if you have a chance, try to watch this movie like it was intended to be seen! On a 70mm screen! If you don't know what that is, the closest comparison would be an IMAX screen. I'm pretty sure there will be some screenings of this if you have a cinema that can play those kind of movies. Anderson really went out there shooting it like this, because it has been some time since it was last used.",/review/rw2706782/?ref_=tt_urv

","What is the nature of man? Is he so depraved and aberrated that he must grovel in his own misery all the days of his life? Or is he merely asleep, bound by the negative emotions of his previous existences, hoping that his perfect nature will be resurrected one fine day? Director Paul Thomas Anderson has long been heralded as a philosopher of the human condition. In his 2012 film, The Master, Anderson employs powerful performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman to readdress themes he discussed in There Will Be Blood (2007).",/review/rw2706782/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2012,Benedict_Cumberbatch,," ""I am a writer, a doctor, a nuclear physicist, a theoretical philosopher, but above all, I am a man, just like you""
","Paul Thomas Anderson has grown as perhaps the greatest American auteur of his generation. At 42, this is his 6th film (following 1996's ""Hard Eight"", 1997's ""Boogie Nights"", 1999's ""Magnolia"" - my all-time favorite -, 2002's ""Punch-Drunk Love"", and 2007's ""There Will Be Blood""). Like the late master Kubrick and the aging master Terrence Malick (who, coincidentally, just debuted his 6th film, ""To the Wonder"", at the latest Venice Film Festival where PTA won the Silver Lion for Best Director), he isn't the most prolific of filmmakers; but his perfectionist creations, cerebral yet strikingly cinematic and emotional, always leave an indelible mark (polarizing audiences but usually earning critical acclaim). ""The Master"" is no exception. Shot on 70mm film, it is not so much of an ""outside"" epic as you'd imagine - although every single image is stunning and perfectly composed (courtesy of cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr., who replaced Robert Elswit, Anderson's usual collaborator). It closely resembles ""There Will Be Blood"" in tone and content, but it stands on its own (Jonny Greenwood is once again responsible for the score).",/review/rw2706782/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2019,RatedVforVinny,8," Joakin delivers yet another masterclass of a performance.
","A fine acting performance by Joakin Phoenix, who plays a miss-fit drifter type, who falls under the spell of a cult leader. An intense film that on a first viewing found, rather heavy going in places. After re-visiting the movie I found it totally absorbing in a most gripping way. This one once seen, will never be forgotten and that surely is the test of a fine movie.",/review/rw2706782/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2012,treywillwest,10," Two very different men try to fulfill one another.
","Unquestionably P.T. Anderson's best film so far. I've always liked his work, but early on I had no sense he would achieve heights such as this. Let me say this, Anderson, ALONE, I think amongst relatively big-budget American filmmakers, allows his imagery to play by its own rules. EVERY other studio filmmaker- from Scorsese to Tarantino, to Jarmusch, plays by some kind of pre-established rules-even if they are the pre-established rules of ""art cinema"" or ""second cinema"". Anderson, like Weerasthakul or Bela Tarr, speaks his own tongue. I thought There Will Be Blood was pretty great, but this is Truly Great- a singularly challenging work of art. Similarly, I would compare Daniel Day-Lewis's work in Blood with Phoenix's work here. The former was impressive, creative, witty. The latter is brave, adventuresome, and merciless. More than any of the ""canonical"" ""method"" performances of cinema, I think Phoenix reaches into places of himself, of all of us, that's very unearthing demands new philosophical questions. Here's my take, for what it's worth, of the ""meaning"" of the film. It's a comparison of two drastically contradictory and complementary personalities. One wants to live without any Master by becoming a Master himself. The other wants a master to give some kind of shape to his life. L. Ron Hubbard- inspired guru Lancaster Dodd (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman in a performance that's beautiful but not ground-breaking) is a con-man, but as I read him, he's not exactly a charlatan. He truly wants to believe the (self-serving) things he's saying, and he needs other people to believe them too. He's very successful at (least the latter half of) this. But this does not make him free. Instead, it turns him into a kind of King and, as we know from the example of Louis XVI, any sovereign is ultimately a privileged prisoner of his/her subjects. They are exempt from the laws of the land, of life, exactly in so far as others believe they are. Dodd's ""freedom"" from mastery is wholly dependent on the worship of the other, an other outstandingly represented by Phoenix's Freddie Quell, a potentially unbreakable ""scoundrel"" who Dodd both fears and admires as such. Quell is a completely, irredeemably, broken individual, whose only surviving qualities are sheer animal instinct- screw, eat, and drink. He yearns to be put back together, to be mastered by some other, to serve some sovereign and thus be welcomed back into civilization. But he's too far gone, or too savage, for that to work. He can't be mastered, even by any coherent sense of self. Dodd seeks the solitude of the sublime but is ultimately made completely dependent on the Other, while Quell, very unwillingly, achieves the freedom, and loneliness, of God.",/review/rw2706782/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2013,phd_travel,3," Intense bizarre well acted but bad approach

6 March 2013,Robert_duder,2," Another art-house dud that hides behind its extreme pretentiousness
","As an enormous movie fanatic who will watch just about anything I can get my hands on, there is nothing I hate more in the world of films then pretentious behaviour. Whether it be the ""movie critics"" that use big words and dissect the meaning of each shot or those that try to convince others of a film's hidden artistic meanings. I am all for a deep, intelligent, breathtaking film. The Master is none of that. It is full of over-hyped performances, a pacing that feels like it will simply never end and a purpose that does not exist no matter what the art-house crowd will try to tell you. The first hour of the movie actually had me hooked. I was at least intrigued and then it continued on and on and on in circles going absolutely nowhere. I was hoping to see an intelligent and riveting story about a charismatic man who starts a religion. Yes, I secretly wanted to see a story about L. Ron Hubbard. Not only does Hoffman's character show no charisma but every single character in the film comes across as nothing more than bizarre and pointless with no chemistry and you care very little about them. The dialogue often becomes pointlessly flowery and symbolic annoying me even more. This film, considering its half decent rating on IMDb and also in reading some of the reviews of it, reeks of that pretentiousness that I hate.",/review/rw2706782/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2012,Monotreme02,9," Cements Paul Thomas Andreson as the most consistent director working today
","In a broad sense, The Master tells the story of a soulless drifter, Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix,) constantly drunk and with no purpose in life, finding sanctuary in the company of The Cause, a cult-like group lead by a charismatic intellectual, Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman.) This plot description does not do the film full justice, because with this film, Anderson fully releases himself from the constraints of traditional narrative storytelling. The film is told in a stream-of-consciousness style, loosely linking together vignettes and moments from the time these two men spend together, without any sense of ""drive,"" ""purpose"" or ""goal"" in the traditional screen writing sense. It is a style perfectly befitting the emotional and spiritual state of the main character, Freddie, adrift in life with no anchor or sense of purpose of his own. Throughout the film, Anderson occasionally cuts back to a shot of the wake of a slow-moving ship, placing us, the audience, aimlessly drifting through the narrative, just as Freddie is. What results is a series of scenes, snapshots of events, some narratively linked and some not. The film is very subjective, and puts us squarely in Freddie Quell's mind; as a result, no easy answers are given, many questions remain mysteries, and we never get a firmly grounded sense of reality; many events remain ambiguous and keep us wondering as to their fidelity long after the film is over.",/review/rw2706782/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2012,littlemartinarocena,10," Oh Master !
","I don't remember when was the last time I got so engrossed in a film that the ending felt like snapping out of a trance. Remarkable in every detail but the detail I appreciate the most is the acting, if one can call it that. Joaquin Phoenix introduced us to a character I had never seen before on the screen. I was compelled, mesmerized. A sensation I hadn't experience since Colin Firth gave us Adrian LeDuc in 1989's ""Apartment Zero"". A total original but solidly planted in a reality that is undeniable. Shattering. Love him or hate him, he's not asking for sympathy on the contrary. He is defiant. Philip Seymour Hoffman adds another spellbinding character to his already extraordinary collection. And you, Mr. Anderson, who are you? Long Live The Cinema!",/review/rw2706782/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2016,TheLittleSongbird,8," Very good and often fantastic-another winner from Paul Thomas Anderson
","Although 'Inherent Vice' has yet to be seen, Paul Thomas Anderson strikes me as an equally talented film-maker and director who has yet to make a bad film. Even his weakest (so far, to me) 'Hard Eight' is still very good, and of his films 'Boogie Nights' and 'There Will Be Blood' are particularly note-worthy films.",/review/rw2706782/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2013,Sergeant_Tibbs,9," A visceral tour de force on every single level. A mesmerising study on the human condition. Film of the year for sure.
","Five years we waited for There Will Be Blood and five years we waited for The Master. With that amount of time between films, it's hard not to expect a complicated grand epic that will cut deep into the soul like Magnolia. Hell, that only took two years. Perhaps Anderson's period dramas are grand epics on a different scale, but they are visceral examinations of the human condition rather than the hugely emotional core. Every film, bar Sydney/Hard Eight or whatever, of Anderson's make my top 100 and I fully expected it to join the rest. Magnolia is basically tied for my all-time favourite film which is enough to make him a favourite. His films have now become events that last for months before and after they've been released so it surprises me that The Master is such a simplistic film. I also expected something super serious and forgot that while Paul Thomas Anderson likes his films to have a weight and purpose, he also always incorporates his sense of humour, whether dark or juvenile.",/review/rw2706782/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2012,PWNYCNY,10," Excellent performances in a profound movie
","This movie features wonderful acting in a complex story which is entirely plausible. Basically, the movie is about a disturbed drifter named Freddie, played by Jaoquin Phoenix, a veteran of combat while serving in the Navy during World War Two, who by sheer chance is brought under the guidance and protection of a charismatic charlatan named Lancaster Dodd, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who is promoting a pseudo-religion that purports to offer a way to cure people of their personal problems and thereby achieve happiness. The cinematography in excellent. The movie also has scenes of graphic nudity which, in this case, are relevant to the story, and which further reveal the nature of Freddie's mind. Freddie is a disturbed individual who is socially dysfunctional. His impulsiveness and anger cause him to repeatedly act out and get into trouble. He tries to deal with his behavioral issues by self-medicating through ingestion of unrefined alcohol, which is poison. During their first meeting, Dodd immediately realizes that Freddie is seriously disturbed and decides to take the ex-Navy man under his care and make him his poster boy for his new religion in order to show his followers that even a case like Freddie can be ""cured."" How Lancaster Dodd subsequently tries and repeatedly fails to ""cure"" Freddie and in the process places the credibility of his entire organization and his personal reputation at risk is what this movie is about. Dodd's wife and his other closest followers tell Dodd that Freddie cannot be cured because Freddie does not want help and is an alcoholic, but Dodd refuses to listen because if he gives up then he will have to admit that his religion is a fraud and that he is a failure and a scam artist. Finally, Dodd's failure is attributed to Freddie's unwillingness to accept help and his alcoholism and he is banished from the program; once again Freddie is adrift in a world, in worse shape than he was before he met Dodd. The chemistry between Mr. Phoenix and Mr. Hoffman is intense; both artists should be nominated for awards. The cinematography is fantastic; the 65 mm format works. The female members of the cast, particularly Laura Dern, are wonderful. Ms. Dern should be given recognition for her performance. This is a great movie which dramatizes the harm that can be done when phonies have a chance to exploit needy and troubled persons who are at risk.",/review/rw2706782/?ref_=tt_urv

","There are so many parallels to Scientology in this film that it certainly forms its backbone, but the film more generally is about the types of people who lead cults (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and those who follow (Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, Laura Dern, Rami Malek). The mental manipulation and cult of personality are a form of abuse, preying on broken people or those looking for answers, and Hoffman and Phoenix are brilliant in representing this in their performances. What's interesting is that while L. Ron Hubbard, er Lancaster Dodd is a nutjob ""making all this up as he goes along"" as his real-life and fictional son put it, the act of auditing, er processing does seem to help Phoenix's character, just as therapy and relationships have a tendency to do.",/review/rw2706782/?ref_=tt_urv
