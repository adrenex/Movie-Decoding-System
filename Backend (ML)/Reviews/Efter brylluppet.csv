","This was probably one of the most under rated movies of 2001. I didn't have many expectations for it either. I am not a Robert Redford fan and I was not familiar with the work of James Gandolfini, but because I am an action fan and the trailer made this out to look like a not to bad action movie I decided to pick it up. The problem with most action movies that run over two hours is that they usually become boring and bogged down with confusing plot twists that ruin the entertainment value. But this movie never once became boring, my eyes were glued to the screen the whole time. Redford and Gandolfini lit up the screen with red hot performances that kept you at the edge of your seat. This movie has everything you could ask for in an action movie, strong performances, strong script, beautifuly directed action sequences and dare I say it, a few touching moments. Redford plays a war hero who is sent to a prision for war verterians. He then plans an uprising against the corrupt prision guard. Your heart will instantly go out to a shy inmate who was accused of beating someone to death with a hammer. The film also has some of the most mouth dropping action scenes that I've seen in a long time. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. So whether you are a fan of prision movies like The Shawshank Redemption or Fortress or a hardened action fan this movie will not dissapoint. I rank this film as one of the best of 2001 along side Made.",/review/rw6307539/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2012,fredericksmith1952,10," Despite the setting, this movie has little to do with prisons.
","Despite the setting, this movie has little to do with prisons. Rod Lurie's vision, combined with the extraordinary talents of Robert Redford and James Gandolfini, is a morality play set in the most unlikely of locations. We have a man who has risen to the height of his potential, the Colonel, who will never advance above that rank, and is bitter with his role in life. He is an administrator among soldiers who wanted to be a soldier and was instead given the task of maintaining order at a prison. That he could show leadership by helping these men to regain their self respect and dignity has escaped him, and he is content to amuse himself by creating situations which lead to the prisoners becoming the animals he believes them to be. When the General comes to his prison, he thinks he has found a kindred spirit who can appreciate his manipulation of the men. To his disappointment, he finds the General a thoughtful and honorable soldier who has chosen to accept his punishment without excuse or explanation. While the Colonel must fight to maintain control, his methods and his intellect lack humanity and understanding. The General is given control by the prisoners because of his intellect and understanding. He offers the prisoners the one thing the warden cannot, dignity. Rated R for language and violence, this film is not for everyone, and certainly not for the very young. It is, however, an essential element in the creation of a leader, and should be seen by anyone who aspires to lead.",/review/rw6307539/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2007,moonspinner55,6," Highly unlikely, but entertaining nonetheless...
","A prisoner's fantasy: decorated U.S. General Robert Redford has been Court Marshalled for disobeying orders during wartime--which resulted in the deaths of eight soldiers--and is sent to a prison for violent criminals (!). He immediately gets on the wrong side of warden James Gandolfini and rallies the inmates to take control of the yard. Fairly typical genre picture with all the usual details, including the stuttering innocent whose bad treatment becomes a catalyst in the warring sides. The film is well-cast and has some fine passages, yet the heavy symbolism (with flying flags, chess moves and endless talk of castles) comes off as self-important in a movie which uses its entire second half to allow violent criminals to run roughshod over security. Redford gives a modest, self-effacing performance--he's so noble he's like visiting royalty; Gandolfini plays his Colonel like an offended child, affecting a soft but precise, lispy voice, giving the one-dimensional role some unexpected subtext. The handsomely photographed film looks great and works its way slyly on the viewer until all defenses are down, but in retrospect its earnestness seems woefully silly. **1/2 from ****",/review/rw6307539/?ref_=tt_urv

","Prison movies can get a little depressing for me after awhile, but this is one of the best I've seen because the two lead actors, Robert Redford and James Gandolfini, are fascinating.

","In an era when most new filmmakers seem less concerned with story than with figuring out new and creative ways to possibly damage their camera equipment, it's encouraging to see someone like Rod Lurie come along.  A former film critic, Lurie has emerged in the last few years as a maker of old-fashioned ""good movies well made"".  He impressed me last year with the political drama ""The Contender"", and this year he brings us ""The Last Castle"", a prison picture that overcomes some dramatic potholes to provide a solid two hours' worth of entertainment.",/review/rw6307539/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film starts with some information on castles : They`ve been around for a thousand years , they contained garrisons and flags and were built to keep out intruders . Yes indeed I can confirm this , castles are very old and they were built to keep people out . As THE LAST CASTLE continues we learn lots of other interesting information like bullets can travel very fast and can kill you ( No sh*t ) and where saluting comes from . What I didn`t learn was anything about the military prison where it`s set or about the inmates which is a major disadvantage seeing as the movie revolves around a military prison",/review/rw6307539/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2004,bob the moo,," None of it really amounts to much but it is watchable if not totally worthy of the heavyweights involved
","Stripped of his rank and sentenced to 10 years in a military prison, Lt. General Irwin's reputation is still very much alive, to the point that the jail's commander has a certain degree of respect for him. Regardless of this though, Irwin must not abide by Winter's rules and become just another of the men. Looking to just serve out his time and go home, Irwin tries to accept his new surroundings, but he finds that the men look to him with a respect that he wishes would go away. However as he becomes familiar with the practises within the prison, he cannot help but assume a leadership role Â– bringing him into direct confrontation with Winter over the brutal, domineering methods he uses.",/review/rw6307539/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2005,bamabryant,8," Redford has the ability to fade
","Redford's ability to fade into a character is profound. Sometimes an actor who has been in the business a very long time will become larger than any role he plays... John Wayne for example (with a couple of exceptions). He becomes Eugene Irwin in this movie. This movie isn't about Redford's character, just like ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" isn't really about Bagger Vance. The Last Castle is about honor to one's self and honor among soldiers, even if they are prisoners. James Gandolfini's portrayal of a colonel who knows nothing of this honor or brotherhood is excellent. He makes you despise his character. Colonel Winters is a deeply disturbing study of corrupt power and jealousy of others' glory. A fine ensemble cast of characters make this movie well worth watching.",/review/rw6307539/?ref_=tt_urv

","Movies about prison are attractive most of the time. However, this one is above the average and deals with an American military prison. Lt. Gen. Eugene Irwin (Robert Redford) is a highly decorated general that after a martial court is convicted to ten years in a military prison. The principal is Col. Winter (the great actor James Gandolfini), a military that has never participate of a combat. He rules the prison as if he were in a war, where the prisoners are the enemies. The presence and the leadership of Irwin will make Col. Winter feels threatened. The duel between them will be great. Watching this battle is worthwhile.

","Saw this on Netflix while searching for movies to watch. 2001 prison movie. Boyfriend didn't want to watch it at first but I am so glad that we did. It's a wonderful film about honor and dignity, and treating others with respect. It is a film about heart and fighting for what is right. A wonderful film with superb acting from everyone.

31 December 2019,Leofwine_draca,6," Some twists on the usual prison film
","THE LAST CASTLE is yet another in the overcrowded genre of prison movies but somehow one that works. That it does so is thanks largely to the winning presence of Robert Redford in the lead role; he brings a quiet dignity to the part, a real focus that makes you believe in his character. The story bears similarities with the likes of COOL HAND LUKE, but the military prison backdrop offers a little novelty. James Gandolfini is commendable as the ruthless bad guy of the piece and the battle of wits between the two men is suitably dramatic. The last half hour becomes quite ridiculous but hugely satisfying with it, so it's a thumbs up from me.",/review/rw6307539/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2009,thinker1691,9," "" Respect is not something automatic , . . . it must be earned ""
","In the long litany of films which Robert Reford has amassed, this film "" The Last Castle "" will certainly be among the epitome of his best. It relates the story of a highly respected and exceptionally talented army general one Lt. Gen. Eugene Irwin, (Robert Redford) who was court-martial-ed for disobeying orders. Thereafter he is imprisoned within a military prison compound presided over by a lack-luster commanding officer named Col. Winter (James Gandolfini) who although he admires the general, believes himself to be his superior. The disgraced general may have been broken in rank, but his reputation soon becomes apparent when the prisoners look to him to re-mediate the harsh, cruel and sadistic methods imposed by the warden. A mental chess game inaugurates between the imposing warden and the prisoner general. Everything the Colonal has learned from books now is tested against actual experience and the outcome is to be over-seen by Gen. Wheeler who seeks to either remove Irwin to another prison or discharge Winter for incompetence. A superb role for Redford who's every bit imposing as a military officer and the superior cast which includes Mark Ruffalo, Steve Burton and Delroy Lindo as Gen. Wheeler. Indeed, this is an exceptional movie and one recommended to anyone seeking the definition of a true leader. ****",/review/rw6307539/?ref_=tt_urv
