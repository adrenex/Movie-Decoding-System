22 December 2005,truegenius-1,," Surprisingly Exciting ""Deal""!
","""Deal or No Deal"", from Endemol, the folks that gave you ""Fear Factor"" and ""Extreme Makeover"", brought this international import to the States for a five-night run on NBC originally back in December 2005. Hosted by Howie Mandel, the show is like a cross between ""Let's Make a Deal"" and ""Russian Roulette"", and here's how it works: A contestant out of the audience chooses one numbered briefcase out of 26 for their game. The cases have cash values ranging from one cent all the way up to $1 million (and there are several six-figure prizes starting at $100,000). All the values are posted on a large, projection-screen TV monitor in the studio. The contestant then begins a process of elimination, calling out the numbers of six briefcases. As each number is called, a lovely model opens the numbered case to reveal the cash amount inside (Mandel: ""Nikki, open the case.""). The cash amount is then removed from the list of cash values on the projection monitor.",/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2007,caa821,2," Just about enough
","Please, spare me!! This program was watchable at its beginning, and Howie Mandell is a likable presence. And even now, he does the best possible, given his ""script,"" and the guests which the producers have chosen.",/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv

","What makes a good game show? A good game show is one that the viewer can play at home while watching it on T.V. You can answer Jeopardy questions or you can solve puzzles on Wheel Of Fortune; however - you, as a viewer, really can't do much of anything on this show.",/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv

","This might be the least challenging game show ever devised. I mean, all you have to know is how to pick a suitcase and have it opened. There are some factors that make it work.",/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2006,babblingbooks,," character analysis at it's most interesting level
","Well, I, for one, find this show to be very interesting and entertaining. Walk away when the commercials come on and come back three or four minutes later and you will eliminate most of the irritation. Howie Mandel does a really good-natured hosting bit that should be a lesson to those that take themselves too seriously.",/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2007,BlackJack_B,2," A sad example of why T.V. has gone down the drain.
","You know, I used to enjoy watching T.V. but today all we're getting is nothing but reality T.V. and terrible game shows that could never match such greats like The Price Is Right or Match Game. The dumbing-down of North American society mandated by Dubya and Hollywood continues to reach new lows and Deal Or No Deal isn't even the nadir.",/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2019,tomfsloan,1," Worst game show
","This show makes Let's Make A Deal look great. Deal or No Deal is such a waste of time. Why do they waste so much time make EVERY question so suspenseful? Jeopardy is fast pace rapid fire. Maybe that's why it's number 1. On the other hand, this is so dreadfully drawn out. I can't watch it. I know Howie Mandel has talent, he was excellent in St. Elsewhere, but it doesn't show here.",/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv

11 September 2006,benbrae76,1," Deal me out!,
","I just cannot warm to this boring and stupid tarting up of ""Take your Pick"". The only saving grace is that the old ludicrous ""Yes, No Interlude"" was omitted. (I am talking about the UK version of the game, not the American, which seems be an altogether more extravagant and flamboyant affair, if the other comments on it are anything to go by.) We have the Lottery, TV Poker, and other shows of their ilk coming out of our nostrils, and it seems to be the modern TV trend to turn the whole country into raving gambling addicts, and this ""game show"" is no exception to the madness.",/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2021,todddaco,6," Same game...new ""models?""
","With the PC world we live in, apparently its offensive to have the same pretty models in a game show? I mean, there are some not-so-attractive ladies here, apparently all in the name of inclusion. Based on that...this is not enjoyable to watch because its always on my mind as to why I have to look at these trolls",/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2008,kellyanderson65,1," People Select Random Numbers. It's Even More Boring than it Sounds.
","How this show got to be considered a hit is beyond me. How can anyone in the world with an IQ of higher than three watch this show and actually consider it to be entertainment? That question will haunt me as long as I live. Howie Mandel is an okay host with a few funny lines every now and then when he talks to the contestants but that is about the only somewhat bright point in this show. All that happens in this show is they choose a contestant who randomly selects numbered briefcases, then they open them, and whatever dollar value is inside gets eliminated from the board, the goal being to NOT eliminate the high values (the highest is one million dollars). That's it. No skill involved at all. After each round of random guessing, the banker calls down and offers them an amount of money to quit. That amount of money is always somewhat less than the average amount of money left between the briefcases. So there's not even any variation there. Just people picking random briefcases. Something is wrong with our society when that becomes a hit.",/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2006,smenapache,," Intellectually challenged???
","Since when does a show have to be ""intellectually Challenging""? Wheel of Fortune has lasted for decades with practically NO intellect required. (Other then knowing the English Language) The reason this ""game"" is so good is because it IS Brilliantly simple. They could've just called it ""Greed"" because that's all it's about.. that and knowing how to play the odds. In the tradition of ""Let's make a Deal"" where contestants keep their prizes or chose between trading for what's behind curtain 1, 2 or 3; there hasn't been a similar game on television since.",/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2008,MairegChernet,5," A couple of episodes and that'll do ya.
","I once used to watch deal or no deal regularly. I watched it every time it came on NBC or any other network, but one day I stopped and thought to myself, did I just succumb to insanity as Einstein defined it, according to Einstein insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting a different outcome (not verbatim). What does this have to do with this show, well keep reading. Deal or no Deal is a show you become an expert at after watching a couple of episodes. Same story same occurrences but maybe the models might differ from one episode to another but mostly even they are the same. So for me there is no point on watching this show regularly when I can predict what's going to happen. After seeing about five or six episodes of this, I could literally tell what case number the players will choose, and what the banker will offer. For a game show it's not bad. But this is not a show you would never get tired of, or at least be in love with for a long time.",/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2008,andykatzlove,," People Pick Random Numbers... That's It... Who Finds This Entertaining?
","All that happens in this entire show is models holding numbered briefcases walk out, then the host (that famous and hilarious guy who starred in the movie ""Walk Like A Man"" in like 1981 then disappeared until now) asks the contestant to randomly pick numbers. Then they open those cases. Wow! That's it. The object is to not open the cases with big dollar amounts in them. A completely random game. After each round, the ""banker"" (a shadowy figure in a booth overlooking the studio floor - possibly one of the host's ""Walk Like A Man"" co-stars) calls down with an offer to buy the briefcase the contestant selected. Then they have to decide if they will take the offer or shout ""NO DEAL!"" and put the smack down on a big red button, which is so dramatic a moment I simply cannot put it into words. This show is almost as boring as watching grass grow. It says nothing but horrible things about our society that this random-numbers-guessing-game is a highly rated TV show.",/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2005,BauersHere007,," This was SO suspenseful!!!!!!
","I liked this show a lot!!! It was incredibly suspenseful!!! The object of the game is really good. There are 26 different cases,each with a different dollar amount. The amount's range from 1 million dollars to 1 cent. Howie Mendal was really cool and made the game fun for everyone. Truthfully I almost had a heart attack watching this.",/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2006,TheVillageRogue,," A Train Wreck of Human Nature - I Can't Stop Watching
","When I first read the little synopsis on this show in TV Guide, I couldn't believe how far Howie Mandell had continued to sink. First those horrible Boston Pizza commercials and now a crappy NBC game show involving no talent whatsoever, outside of the ability to calculate odds (which, oddly enough, nobody on the show seems to be able to do).",/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2007,baumer,10," My frustration with the contestants keeps me watching
",I love this show. It's the best game show to air since the original Millionaire. It is so simple and that is what makes it so brilliant. Howie is the perfect game show host and his personality and quick wit combined with the greed of the contestants make the show the most fun hour on TV.,/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2008,KUAlum26,," Falsehoods,Oh,the falsehoods.
","First off,I don't want to sound like some buzz-kill here in regards to this show,or sound like I'm taking this show too seriously. Basically,when and if I watch this,besides the possibility that there's not much else on,I watch this primarily because I'm a student of human nature,and I do find it interesting what--when it comes to money--is any given individual's ""breaking point"" is. Sometimes I put myself in the place of the contestant,where I would or wouldn't deal. Sometimes I put myself in the role of Howie(and he does a very good job as the host,one part friend,one part Devil's advocate,lighter on the advocate). I even occasionally put myself in the role of one of the Oh-so-Gorgeous models(don't ask)! Much of the time,though,I'm usually just watching to guess what the Banker would do,figuring how much he would offer according to which cases have been opened.",/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2006,bighaben,1," Horrible
","I hate this show. Simple as that. It's horrible. The show takes an annoying host, and throws endless amounts of commercials at times where it seems suspenseful, but is just annoying, and is clearly just trying to scrounge out a few more dollars.",/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2022,snitzell,1," What they advertise.....
",Ain't what you'll get. Your first clue to not waste time on this show is all the scantily clad models and their fake emotions. They get nothing extra no matter what amount they're holding. Maybe if they had a LeMan's start with them scrambling and wrestling for a briefcase it would add excitement.,/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2006,enrichus,1," Boring
","I'm not very patient. Waiting for Howie to reveal what's in the cases is infuriating with his after the commercial delay after his deadpan, dumb expression delay. All the drama surrounding the contestant's ""deal or no deal"" and their helper's standing nearby to help is childish. Howie's germ fetish is ridiculous. If he is that afraid of touching hands why is he on the show. Howie is not as funny as a host than when he is doing stand-up comedy with his ""glove"" on his head. Maybe he needs to put the gloves on his hands. Get the show moving!!! I'm afraid that the show would be only fifteen minutes long if that happened. I don't watch the show anymore even if there is nothing else on the ""tube"". Then, TV is off. Sorry, Howie, I hope you didn't quit your day job!",/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv

20 December 2005,troygood1,," Very Suspenseful Game Show
","I think we got ourselves a big hit! Here is the scenario: 26 models-Each one is carrying a briefcase that has amounts of money-From $1 Million Dollars to a single penny. They are some risks each contestant has to face by picking one briefcase at a time, and after that, The Man upstairs give Howie a phone call, then after that Howie ask him/her a simple question: Deal... or No Deal? Somehow, these players will eventually become greedy pigs as the game progresses when each player calls out a briefcase number, it reveals an amount of money, then the amount goes off the board. It plays out just like The American Idol Result Show: Trying to find out what are the results. But when they reveal-They'll go to a break first. I think this also plays out like ""Who wants to be a Millionaire""-but there are no hard questions before you win the money. I think this show will be on for a long time after one week.",/review/rw1243772/?ref_=tt_urv
