","In the near future, Parker Barnes (Denzel Washington) is an ex-cop who has been sent to prison for murder.  The circumstances surrounding his crime are disheartening and elicit empathy.  Now, he is offered a chance at freedom from prison.  Parker must hunt down and destroy a murderous cyborg, SID 6.7 (Russell Crowe), who is menacing the general public after jumping out of a virtual reality program.  The chase takes on many twists and turns as SID terrorizes, shoots and kidnaps victims in his path.  Can SID be stopped?",/review/rw0374843/?ref_=tt_urv

","So finally, after decades of futuristic scientists proclaiming that virtual reality will someday be here, it's here - sort of. Hollywood's always been a midwife for technology between the science industry and the common man, and in the area of virtual reality it's given us ""Johhny Mnemonic"" and this actioner, starring Denzel Washington.",/review/rw0374843/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2006,lee_eisenberg,5," Fairly interesting, although both stars have done better.
","For the most part, ""Virtuosity"" is basically another virtual reality-themed movie so full of action that it almost hurts. But interestingly enough, there is a little bit of a plot here. Denzel Washington plays Lt. Parker Barnes, who has to help find SID 6.7 (Russell Crowe), a virtual serial killer who has escaped into the real world in 1999 LA.",/review/rw0374843/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2008,alexkolokotronis,6," It Had A Lot of Potential
",Virtuosity is by no means a great movie or a good movie. It is barely above average. That though is because of Russell Crowe's character: SID 6.7 who possesses over 150 serial killer personalities. He is just supposed to be used to train police but he escapes from his virtual reality to the reality. That sounds pretty interesting and this premise could be taken into many different directions especially since he is such a complex character you could go so many different way going about to make this film. Though this movie did not take the worst direction it did not take the best one. This movie went for pure action and no real drama or meaningful message. Now that is OK but it lacked in doing this because of the: The directing which was average by Brett Leonard. He made this into a very exciting TV movie which it is not. He had two very talented actors in Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe yet he was not able to generate the excitement and fast pace feeling that is needed to make a good action movie.,/review/rw0374843/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2002,Agent10,7," A fun ride
","The first great film for Russell Crowe, and a very interesting film to say the least. Cyber culture is rarely ever depicted in movies, but this was one of those films which brought some of these underground tendencies to light. What was even more interesting was how evil Sid 6.7 was. Crowe did an excellent job of portraying the demented cyber villain. I especially liked Denzel Washington, who always manages to be believable in his role when he doesn't try to be a soul brotha.' Granted, the cinematography was pretty average as well as the music, but then again, the performance of the two main stars really made this film a winner.",/review/rw0374843/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2000,negeati,7," many flaws, one major redemption
","""Virtuosity"" represents familiar ground for director Brett Leonard. He dealt with virtual reality in the astonishingly awful ""Lawnmower Man"". This time, the special effects are more elaborate and successful but they are not state-of-art, even for a 1995 movie. The plot is also ordinary: how many times has a special man been sent to stop an almost unkillable murderer. However there are two twists to the formula: the first one is that the killer is a virtual killer, the second one is that he is played by Russell Crowe.",/review/rw0374843/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2010,Quinoa1984,7," a predictable yarn with some better than expected action and surprising acting
","Brett Leonard is a name that has fallen by the wayside, and, maybe rightfully so. The director of such a film as The Lawnmower Man didn't really make anything of note since this film Virtuosity (unless one counts Highlander 5: The Source to be of actual quality which is hard to argue for), but there was a time when he knew where to put the camera and shoot as far as action and competency with his actors. The plot of Virtuosity is cut out of other movies to be sure, and would be again (one may be reminded of 12 Monkeys with its convicted man put on a mission by his captors, or even by Batman with its anti-hero and psychotic villain creating chaos all over the city), but, perhaps if only in retrospect, the movies carries some solid entertainment in the near-mindless tradition of loud, stupid Hollywood science fiction movies of the 90's. It's like John Woo lite.",/review/rw0374843/?ref_=tt_urv

","You can't help but like Crowe's gleeful portrayal of a schizophrenic nano-bot serial killer in this ridiculous film, and with futuristic fascists, pervey programmers and a bucket loads of virtual reality cyber nonsense, this should really be a winner in the style of The Demolition Man or the Robocop series. But where other films in the genre have used such tools as wit and plot to keep the more intelligent of the viewers amused, this film, um, hasn't.",/review/rw0374843/?ref_=tt_urv

","Virtual Reality gets a look, following in the footsteps of ""The Lawnmower Man."" If you saw ""The Matrix""(99) and were wondering where you glimpsed the VR scenery years earlier, it may have been in this pic. Here, Denzel gets to briefly run around inside a VR world, chasing after virtual killer Russell Crowe, known as Sid 6.7 (very close to 6.66, isn't it?). Sid 6.7 is the latest computer program, a conglomeration of about 200 serial killers & mass murderers, and so advanced it's virtually self-aware. The bulk of the picture takes place in the real world, to which Sid 6.7 manages to escape to with the help of very advanced nanotechnology. I believe this was supposed to take place slightly in the future (1999), but from our perspective, it's old hat and square. Everything looks outmoded and just old, except the strangely hi-tech VR and nanites.",/review/rw0374843/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2012,fredericksmith1952,7," Seventeen years ago, this was a wild fantasy.
","Set in the very near future, Virtuosity explores the evil fantasy of every science fiction addict by bringing an evil virtual villain out of the computer and onto the streets. Seventeen years ago, this was a wild fantasy. Today, with the way we are going with computers, not so much. But you have to enjoy the acting in this one as well as the plot, which is somewhat original. The cast is eclectic, with the powerful Russell Crowe as the virtual bad guy, a two dimensional creature bent on death and destruction, and Crowe brings a frightening believability to the role. Denzel wasn't quite the heart throb at the time, but his portrayal of Parker Barnes is excellent, and we get to feel the characters emotions and angst as he is taunted again and again by this evil construct. Louise Fletcher is the uncaring, evil woman in charge of the virtual simulations, and she is perfectly opposed by Kelly Lynch (aka Mrs. John Travolta) throughout the film. A cameo by Traci Lords and an early performance by a 10 year old Kaley Cuoco (Penny on Big Bang Theory) round out an excellent cast and make for an entertaining film. Rated R for violence, language, and disturbing content, including sex, this is one for an afternoon or evening when you are tired of the run of the mill fare. Collectible? Not necessarily, but worth a rental.",/review/rw0374843/?ref_=tt_urv

","Despite negative reviews, I thought ""Virtuosity"" would be a fun film. I like Denzel Washington, and it seemed to have a decent plot, that though it seemed silly, I thought would explain itself better in the film.

At a disadvantage with only a bionic arm, Mr. Washington makes up the difference in determination. He is assisted by Los Angeles blonde Kelly Lynch (as Madison Carter), who comes with a vulnerable nine-year-old daughter. Watch out, Kaley Cuoco, for the man from the cable company. Washington and others keep trying to stop Mr. Crowe with ordinary bullets. Crowe bares his firm buttocks for Stephen Spinella (as Daryl Lindenmeyer).

21 August 2010,thinker1691,8," "" There are worlds beyond your comprehension, wherein I am God ""
","Just when you think you have seen the last of a movie, the unimaginative producers gather enough cash to re-make a film which has already been seen. In 1991, with John Lithgow playing the heavy, Denzel Washington was the puppet in a movie called 'Ricochet.' It is now five years later and once again Mr. Washington is taken for a violent ride in this Brett Leonard film called "" Virtuosity. "" Writer Eric Bernt has reached into his fertile imagination and created a Virtual Frankstein called SID 6.7 (Russell Crowe). The story is that under computer expert, Lindenmeyer (Stephen Spinella) a creative genius, a super criminal called SID, once confined within a virtual world has escaped. With Police Chief Cochran (William Forsythe, finally playing a Good-guy), oversees, Lt. Parker Barnes, (Denzel Washington) a former detective as he sets out to recapture an impervious maniacal Android. Each place Sid arrives at, he creates fears, destruction, mounting murders and general mayhem. It's up to Barnes to capture or destroy SID before he lays waste to the city. With Louise Fletcher and Kelly Lynch in supporting roles, this movie is from start to finish a real shoot-em-up action and excitement offering. Perhaps now with its completion we might have an opening for NEW ideas and give Mr, Washington a real challenging role. ****",/review/rw0374843/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2012,buckikris,6," Virtually Weird and Totally Crazy!
","I bought this film awhile back for 50 cents on Amazon, just because William Fichtner was in it. I think he is a talented actor, who ranked up there among the best like Washington, Ford, Connery, etc.. Yes i am a huge Fichnter fan and he and Washington made it tolerable to watch this weird and unrealistic film. I am not a Russell Crowe fan at all, like his character SID 6.7, Crowe is so full of himself it's pathetic. First off the film is bazaar, it has to take place 15 years or more into the future. Think about it what police department would spend that kind of money on a virtual reality program to train their police officers. It a fact a computer can only train officer so much, while most of the training is done with real instructors; and real police academy students. I watched this movie again last night and didn't know whether to classify it as a comedy or Sci-Fi. I think the reason why I gave it a 6 star rating is because it does have some humor to it. As for paying money to see it at the theater, I'm glad I didn't. I then found out it was form the same director as the one who made Lawnmower Man, and that movie was more of a mistake than Virtuosity. THX, Kris L. CocKayne",/review/rw0374843/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2002,dee.reid,10," The best violent video game ever made!
","""Virtuosity"" plays out a lot like any ultra-violent video game.  Denzel Washington plays the hero Parker Barnes while an over-the-top Russell Crowe plays Sid 6.7, the villain.  The setting is futuristic Los Angeles.  The story is that a hostile computer program (Sid 6.7) has escaped cyberspace and has assumed human form and an incarcerated cop (Barnes) is the only person who can stop him.  Sid 6.7 craves media attention, as he is the composite of 183+ serial killers including Adolf Hitler, Charles Manson, and the man who murdered Parker's wife and daughter.  Sid constantly uses taunts to try to get Parker to slip up and leaves a trail of dead bodies as well. The protagonist is played much like any other, he's vulnerable and is determined to stop the villain.  The antagonist is like any classic villain, completely over-the-top and only exists to be beaten.  However, Sid is not like most video game villains.  Sid is nearly invincible because he is not human, but a machine.  In addition to that, he can regenerate his injuries by using the silicon properties of glass.  This proves to be quite a challenge for Parker as it makes defeating Sid very difficult.  In the end, this advantage is also Sid's only weakness: the larger his injuries, the longer time it will take to regenerate and the easier it is for him to be defeated.",/review/rw0374843/?ref_=tt_urv

8 September 2004,TxMike,," Has an interesting futuristic premise, but loaded down with too many 'chase' scenes.
","DVD from my public library. ""Virtuosity"" takes place some time in the future, when virtual reality is more advanced, such that a character can assume a personality, even begin to change itself, however all safely locked away in a virtual environment. That is, until two experimenters collaborate, and a virtual reality chip is put into a machine that synthesizes a life-like android. One that looks just like Russell Crowe comes out, naked, and equipped with features of over 200 real, notorious men, most master criminals. Something like this on the loose is very dangerous, and in fact begins to kill for sheer pleasure. The only man thought to be able to find and defeat this android is an imprisoned cop, played by Denzel Washington. And that is the story, the movie, to see which of these two will emerge victorious. Interesting premise, but at times it become so loaded with the baggage of intricate chase scenes, with all the cliché's we've seen before, that it becomes just another ordinary movie. However, Russell Crowe shows what a fine actor he already was, before he hit fame!",/review/rw0374843/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2004,ratmouse,10," ""Hey Parker, this one's for you!""
","I caught 'Virtuosity' on late-night tv years ago not expecting much and i loved it. I recently managed to hunt down a copy of the dvd (ah yes the joys of widescreen and stereo sound!) This movie is by far (in my opinion) Russell Crowe's and Denzel Washington's best movie. I've watched it at least 6 times now and it always manages to keep me entertained every time. Many people seem to disregard this movie as bad, but i think they are taking it the wrong way; taking it too serious. It's much like a dark comedy, and is done in an almost comic-book fashion, with SID 6.7 (Russell Crowe) stealing the show with a top-notch performance. Crowe is hilarious, and Denzel is good. I really feel for his character in this movie and what he goes through. I don't think that anyone could have a worse case of deja-vu. There's plenty of action, a great supporting cast, and plenty of humor by Crowe. This movie is a very fun game of cat-and-mouse. It's sad that this movie is so under-rated, because it's great. I give Virtuosity a rating of 10 out of 10--excellent sci-fi action movie! ""Say thank you!""",/review/rw0374843/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,6," To think that this was so close to having something to say
","It's not difficult to tell that this was directed by the same guy as The Lawnmower man was. VR hits the big screen... uh, again. And it's about equally as painful as last time, meaning, it's got moments. It looks better this time around, if the effects today are fairly dated. If all you're looking for is a decent action flick with CGI and high tempo rock/techno beats pumping, look no further. This is fun enough. For me, however, there aren't enough excellent films out there to justify wasting such potential as this. I mean, really, if this was handled at least a little better, it could truly provide food for thought and provoke, especially if the mainstream approach of this was kept somewhat intact. But the point of our attraction to violence is muddled when this begins to be gratuitous, graphic and brutal in its depiction of such, and this never seems to dare tricking the audience into thinking that what they're looking at is the reality of the flick and not a simulation, as it's simply always obvious, so that philosophical topic remains basically untouched here, as well. The plot is fine, if fairly predictable. A serial killer program escapes the computer into a human-looking body consisting of nanites, and a former cop is sent to get him. The acting is pretty good, mostly. Washington is less great than usual. Crowe hams it up like a Schumacher Batman villain. The cinematography and editing are standard. Apart from what I've already mentioned, this has infrequent strong language and disturbing content. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to those merely searching for something that's reasonably entertaining. 6/10",/review/rw0374843/?ref_=tt_urv

I could not believe that someone said Washington should have won an award for this film. A stupid story, how could this guy come to life; this is like the Holldeck in Star Treck.
