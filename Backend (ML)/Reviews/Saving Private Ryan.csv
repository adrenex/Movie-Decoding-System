26 March 2019,Sleepin_Dragon,10," Ricky Gervais I salute you.
","I have to be honest, this is one of the best series I have watched in some time, it really is Gervais at his very best.",/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2019,debdshaw60,10," If I could give this a higher score I would
","Ricky Gervais knows how to make you laugh and ugly cry, sometimes together. I think this is my favorite of his series. He speaks right to the dark, sad, and angry part in all of us. He also shows us that everyone is beautiful.",/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2020,csteddy,10," Season 2 is even better than Season 1
",My wife and I watched Season 1 and laughed and cried our way through it. I'm having to do Season 2 on my own as my wife's three year struggle with cancer recently ended. I find his detailed understanding of the grief amazingly accurate. Tony's pain seeps through the screen. Ricky is a genius and an authentic human being.,/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2019,dystopian-galaxy,9," Nothing's as good if you don't share it
","I stumbled across After Life when I wasn't interested in anything on My List and I didn't care to Continue Watching anything either. I've never been married and I've never lost the love of my life, mainly because I haven't met them, but I have struggled with depression for years now and this past year has been a particularly hard battle. The portrayal of grief and depression I found to be very relatable, the story was told very realistically and the cast were brilliant. I particularly loved Anne and Daphne. Perfect show to binge watch and just allow yourself to feel all of the emotions and then share it with someone because nothing's as good if you don't share it.",/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2021,gianmarcoronconi,10," Wonderful
",One of the best series I've ever seen in my entire life. Sweet and fun in a shrewd and truly original way. Each episode is more and more beautiful and the whole series encourages you to go on because it never gets boring.,/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2019,grantss,10," Brilliant: incredibly dark, gritty, thought-provoking and emotional yet hilariously funny
",(Review updated after Season 3).,/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,Calicodreamin,8," Beautiful, sad, and funny
","An almost unbelievable mix of beauty, sadness, and laughs. The characters are well cast and have great chemistry. The premise is heartbreaking but so many beautiful moments happen, you can almost forget. A lovely show on loss, love, and keeping going.",/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv

8 March 2019,dannehh,10," Death brings life (or something deep like that)
","Ricky Gervais does it again.
Makes me laugh, makes me cry and makes me think!
I rather have six brilliant episodes than 20 so and so!",/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2021,lee_eisenberg,9," Ricky Gervais does it again
","I've liked every one of Ricky Gervais's productions that I've seen, and now I can add ""After Life"" to that. It's a clever yet bittersweet series. Definitely check it out if you get a chance.",/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2019,katyavines,10," A perfect display of the grieving process
","Ricky Gervais continues to surprise me. I know that he's very funny, with his own brand of humor that many people find offensive, but I like most of his stuff. And I think of him as a comedian - both as an actor and a writer/director. So every time he does something serious and thoughtful, I am amazed at the level of depth, humility and kindness he brings to his creations.
""After Life"" is the story of a man who just lost his beloved wife, and with her, the will to live. He probably would have killed himself immediately, if he didn't have a dog to take care of. So he manages to get out of bed every day, and lead an existence devoid of any shred of happiness or hope. He titters on the brink of death, yet doesn't cross the line; he manages to anger, but not completely alienate those closest to him. People annoy him, probably because they go on living despite the fact that his world has ended. Worst of all, he claims to not care about his own life to the point where he deliberately puts himself in harm's way, yet the only people that he's hurting by his behavior are the people who still care about him.
I recently lost the person that I loved most in this world, and who loved me the most, and this show displayed so precisely all the feelings that I've been going through. All the terrible feelings and thoughts that you don't share with anyone, because they are too dark to put into words.
I'm so grateful to Gervais for doing it for me. Now when someone asks me how I'm feeling, I can reffer them to this show.",/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2019,spurs68,10," I defy anyone to watch just one episode and then not binge watch the rest
","Easily his best work since 'The Office', maybe even his best work. Poignant, funny, heart warming and beautifully acted. If you watch one thing this year make it this (clearly you won't just watch one thing but not matter how many it is, make sure After Life is included). It is 6 episodes of the most beautifully crafted television on a subject matter that has no right to be this funny. However, the humour is always tinged with sadness (and vice versa) and the balance between the two is perfect.",/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2019,rooprect,10," 13 Reasons for grownups and without encouraging suicide (Netflix, are you listening?)
","""After Life"" is an extremely heavy yet surprisingly humorous look at depression, rage, suicide, nihilism, sociopathy and all those things that'll probably get you locked up if you dare speak of them aloud. In that respect, as my title implies, it's a show in the genre of Netflix's controversial ""13 Reasons"", a show aimed at teenagers which is ostensibly supposed to ""start a discussion on suicide"" but, unfortunately as multiple studies have shown, it has encouraged, glorified and led to a rise in suicides amongst teenage girls. Whether or not those studies are accurate, the notion that even 1 child may have been coerced into suicide as a result should be enough for Netflix to pull it off the roster, but alas they are digging their heels in.",/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2019,dierregi,8," An honest take on the process of grieving
","Anybody who lost a much-loved one will probably appreciate the unsentimental take on the struggle to regain a will to live after a devastating loss. The mighty efforts one must make just to get up, without any desire to go through yet another day; the lack of pleasure in doing anything; the lazy carelessness that lets everything fall to pieces... all the familiar symptoms of grieving are out in the open.",/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2019,zathan-32848,10," Absolutely genius
","There is nothing bad to be said about this. Every actor is marvellous.
The story, the caracters are just warm and so real.",/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2019,mhorg2018,10," Funny, sad, brilliance from Ricky Gervais
","There's only one comedian (when he's doing stand up) I can compare Ricky Gervais to: He's this generation's George Carlin. Uncompromising, thoughtful, funny, and, to some (not myself) offensive, he's a comedy genius.
After Life is his masterpiece. As Tony, a man who cannot live, yet cannot die without his wife, who has passed away from cancer, he treats the world around him as a personal kickball, treating everyone he encounters, except his senile father (a brilliant performance from the man who played the much hated Walder Frey on Game of Thrones), he moves through life like a force of nature, rejected everyone who shows him any kindness. If this sounds like the show is a downer, it's not. It's quite uplifting, especially the videos his wife has left him. Few things I've ever watched have ever really moved me. This is one.",/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2019,wisewebwoman,9," Brilliant portrayal of devastating grief.
","I'm a fan of Ricky Gervais. I've seen all his work from The Office to Derek and Extras and he is insightful, painfully so, into the human condition.",/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2019,sinagk,10," Gives you a new perspective
",I watched the show in one sitting. It is challeging. It makes you think with great humor. It has its dramas. It will make you almost cry while making you laugh. It's genius and I recommend you watch it if you think you are depressed or you see no point in life. And I guess it's greatest characteristic is that its honest.,/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2020,doomedmac,8," An important show
","I think there are some people who really need to watch this show. It's not perfect, but it's portrayal of depression and nihilism is strong. Ricky Gervais is great in this show, and the writing is (usually) pretty great.",/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2020,diggerz039,10," Just Brilliant
","Ricky is truly a gift. Hes amazingly talented in so many ways. He can write, direct and act!",/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2020,areatw,," The best TV show I've watched in a long time
","Ricky Gervais is a divisive character but I've always been a big fan of his. I love his style of comedy and have always enjoyed his shows in the past. However, I think with 'After Life' Gervais has achieved more than just another great show and has exceeded even my very high expectations.",/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2019,fake-punk,8," Amazing
","This is a really really good show, absolutely worth watching. Yeah it's heartbreaking at times but also incredibly funny and sweet. Ricky Gervais is a genius.",/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv

8 March 2019,miasweeney,10," ""Happiness is amazing. It's so amazing, it doesn't matter if it's yours or not""
","I just watched the entire thing in one go, and honestly think it's the best work he's ever done. Just brilliant.",/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2019,tompo-75561,10," Out of darkness...
","Beautiful.
I've been a fan of Gervais since the 11 o clock show so anything he does I pay attention to.
This is like nothing he's done before but it's almost autobiographical as a lot of his views are in this script.
As much as it's very funny a lot of the parts that made me smile were the sad things in life we never want to happen to us.
It's so well scripted and acted the humanity is everything that makes it funny.",/review/rw4712046/?ref_=tt_urv
