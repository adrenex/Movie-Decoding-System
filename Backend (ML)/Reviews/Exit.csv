13 March 2019,eddie_baggins,6," A box-office dud destined for cult status
","At one stage thought to be some form of Cloverfield sequel/prequel, thanks to the association with wonder producer J.J Abrams and his production company Bad Robot, Overlord is very much a film set in its own universe that takes us on a gore filled World War 2 set adventure to occupied France, as a small collection of American soldiers discover that German run labs are not the ideal place to spend time in.",/review/rw4753304/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2019,Leofwine_draca,7," One of the better Nazi horror flicks
","OVERLORD is another addition to the small but ever-growing subgenre of Nazi-themed horror movies, which usually involve zombies and the like. It's similar in plot and tone to FRANKENSTEIN'S ARMY but more mainstream and less grindhouse in feel, although it still proves a gritty and gruesome adventure. I think the idea of American paratroops facing zombie experiments during the D-Day invasion is a great one, so this had to handle the concept really badly for me not to enjoy it. However, it's all good. The main characters are interesting and generally likeable; the villains are nasty and scheming; the zombies themselves sufficiently icky and horrible. Extensive CGI is used to depict certain fiery moments and the effect is chaotic, which is as it should be. Despite copious bloodshed this goes down the action rather than horror route, and works well in that regard despite cliches popping up regularly. I enjoyed it.",/review/rw4753304/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,AlsExGal,5," A misfire that is a mixture of genres
","WWII men-on-a-mission meets horror in this misfire. A group of US soldiers are airdropped behind enemy lines on the eve of D-Day in order to take out a radio jammer located in a church tower in a small French village. The occupying Germans are also using the church to conduct gruesome medical experiments that have resulted in a pseudo-zombie formula. Now the troops have to not only take out the tower in less than a few hours, but must also stop the monstrous menace below.",/review/rw4753304/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," Call Of Wolfenstein: Overlord
","'Overlord (2018)' certainly has tonal issues, often being properly horrific but seeming to want to inject humour at the most inopportune of moments. It's also quite schlocky essentially every time it tries to do anything more traditionally 'war movie'-esque. This is especially prevelant in the moments where it wants us to believe its heroes are being overtly and defiantly heroic, in spite of their army-given orders or previously quite unlikable (sometimes contemptible) character-traits, or in the times where it tries to tie its events directly into the narrative of the overall Second World War - which is actually quite disturbing not in its slightly jingoistic and strangely campy ending but in its undercurrent of Nazi experimentation, something that did really occur to an extent perhaps less sensational but far more despicable than what's seen here. Really, the issues come down to the writing, which isn't as nuanced as it perhaps thinks it is but also isn't as straight-forwardly 'genre-specific' as it perhaps ought to have been. There are times when the flick works, though, which mainly come when it slips straight into the fantastical, horror territory where it feels most at home and, indeed, adept. Here, it puts the historical context further into the background than before, using it as a backdrop for a sort of silly but played-straight science-fiction flick that actually works well when it tries to scare and make squirm. The visuals are pretty much universally good and, aside from a couple of unnecessarily glorified gore-shots, the violence is presented as believably painful and properly gruesome, too. Ultimately, this makes for a flawed experience that's at its best when it just lets the viscera fly like it is slick, big-budgeted and generally very well put-together grindhouse-bound 'trash art'. 6/10",/review/rw4753304/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2018,Krush_Burner,8," The Most Expensive Nazisploitation Film Ever Made
","This is not the first time when J. J. Abrams put the finances into the risky project (remember ""Cloverfield""), but this is definitely a curious choice for such a filmmaker. ""Overlord"" is the rare hybrid of a WWII film and a zombie horror - kind of movies that were prosperous back in 1970s and early 1980s, but has been long gone since then. And even in those times most of them were cheap and cheesy exploitation films, full of gore and nudity. (And yes, lots of people nowadays will think not of grindhouse cinema, but rather of ""Call Of Duty"" or ""Wolfenstein"" game series, which is an obvious point of reference here.)",/review/rw4753304/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2018,jrugg19,8," Going to turn into a Cult Classic
","Overlord is essentially a B-movie with a Hollywood budget, great action, and a TON of gore. I really enjoyed this movie quite a bit, especially in the opening scene, which was shot very well. This movie is an action-horror set during World War II when a bunch of American Soldiers discover that the Germans are up to something sinister in one of their bases, and that is all I will say about the plot. It's awesome to watch. The films cast doesn't consist of any A-Listers or Superstars, but has a lot of recognizable faces such as Wyatt Russell, (who's performance reminded me a lot of his dad Kurt in The Thing), Pilous Asbaek and Jacob Anderson of Game of Thrones fame, John Magaro and Bokeem Woodbine, and newcomers Jovan Adepo and Mathilde Olliver as the leads. To sum it up, Overlord is the type of movie that is going to develop a fanbase years from now, it is very fun and will satisfy those both looking for intense action and gory horror, and I can easily recommend this. We can all thank Julius Avery for directing such a fun movie and J.J Abrhams for deciding to NOT turn this film into a Cloverfield movie.",/review/rw4753304/?ref_=tt_urv

20 October 2018,BenHarley1138,7," Seen at Toronto After Dark Fest
","I was really excited to see this movie because of JJ Abram's involvement, and the trailer absolutely sold me, so when I saw this was showing a couple weeks early I made sure not to pass up the opportunity.
So how was it?
It was really good. I didn't think it was great, but it has some really cool stuff that was very entertaining, and overall I had a good time. The first thing I'll get into would be the VFX, which I believe were created by ILM. The gore effects were incredible and made me squirm in delight, and the opening sequence of the squads plane getting shot down over France was spectacular. It looks absolutely stunning and is equally terrifying, especially with the excellent sound design.
The cast for the most part was good, I wouldn't say anyone was outstanding but they were really good. One comedic character in particular worked very well, and the dynamic between the leads was fun and interesting, but it never goes too deep. But let's face it, I didn't go to the movie for deep characters, I went for the WWII Nazi zombies.
I was a little let down to be honest with the amount of zombie material in the movie. Maybe that's a little nit picky but a lot of the best zombie stuff was shown in the trailer, and although it's more fleshed out in the final film, it would've been nice to have seen some other crazy stuff that we hadn't already seen bits of. Then again, the zombie sequences and effects that are in the movie are fantastic, both creepy and undeniably fun. I guess I just would've liked a little more.
I guess I'll end this by saying if you want a fun WWII/zombie movie, go see this. We need more R-rated blockbusters like this, so go support this one.",/review/rw4753304/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't know if the critics watched the same movie I did. This was a mediocre action movie, a mediocre horror movie, and a poor war movie. They went all out with the historical inaccuracies, so why not do it with a little humor? This movie took itself way too seriously. Watch it as a download.",/review/rw4753304/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2018,Shazam1303,7," Entertaining with flaws...
","Let me start of by saying... The movie was nice. Expected a bit more horror and maybe even more zombies. That would have made it a perfect score for me. Nonetheless what it did have was a lot of action and a lot of tension. Overall a fun watch and everybody in the room enjoyed it. Heroic storyline, a lot of gore, one of the best opening sequences I've seen in a while and some decent humor. Grab your boys and catch it at the movies if u can. Popcorn flick for a good time at the movie theater! Don't expect an Oscar contender here! Then You'll have plenty fun!",/review/rw4753304/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2018,Matt345,," Incompetent crap
","Terrible writing: absolutely terrible characters, terrible dialogue, terrible story-development. And, besides, probably some of the worst WW2 American soldiers ever put on film, not all of which seems even intentional.
That the plot would be dumb is kind of a given, but this is just incompetent, and given the cheesy bloat and self-importance of a big production to make it fully insufferable. The dialogue is the kind of terrible that is not merely hammy and clichéd, but the kind that knows it can be clichéd and ""not smart"", and therefore is satisfied with just being plain bad.
The characters are so awful, one can't call them characters, but just attempts at ones which are played by actors with specific faces. The same as for the dialogue and plot, their ""deliberate"" attempts at being awful are indistinguishiable from them just being badly written.
Yes, some of the things we are shown are also somewhat ""terrifying"" (actually just a small selection, which by the way doesn't include such attempts like a jumpscare by a soldier seeing an ordinary corpse in WW2), to get that semantic ambiguity out of the way, however the movie is unbearably bad and not entertaining after the basics are established...",/review/rw4753304/?ref_=tt_urv

15 November 2018,kjproulx,9," Intense from Start to Finish
","It's a rarity that movies like this are made today. Original concepts are either tampered with by a studio or forced to change in order to fit a franchise or set up an entire universe of movies. It's rare that filmmakers in Hollywood (these days) are given complete freedom to create the movie they want to create, or so it seems. Happily, after watching Overlord, I noticed none of that. While the subject matter may not interest a large audience, I believe this movie can be enjoyed by fans of many genres. If you have an open mind, whether you're a fan of war films, sci-fi films, or a good old fashion slasher/horror, I think Overlord may impress you as much as it impressed me. From start to finish, here's why I believe it's very hard for audience members to get bored with this one.",/review/rw4753304/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2019,Amthermandes,8," Coulda done with more horror, but, it is still good!
","Entertaining movie that plays out the more fictional side of the Nazi experimentation. We all know it's fact the Nazis during WWII were up to no good, including many extreme experiments using humans as lab rats, this movie takes it and runs with it into an entertaining horror/action flick about what strange discoveries the Germans may have had. It's not as gory or as scary as one would hope for, I personally was hoping for something along the lines of John Carpenter's ""The Thing,"" and while they did use mostly practical special effects, and while it is action packed, with a good story, decent characters, and some good horror moments, it definitely lacks enough to classify it mostly as an action thriller and not a horror. Take ""Band of Brothers"" and mix it with either ""Blood Creek"" or ""Outpost"" (both 2008). Crazy lab experiments, great action and intense scenes, some decent horror moments, but it was mostly just an action flick focused on getting the job done, could have been a lot more scary and effective, but still a decent and worth-while watch!",/review/rw4753304/?ref_=tt_urv
