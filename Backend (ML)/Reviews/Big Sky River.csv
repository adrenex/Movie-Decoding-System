9 July 2003,grendelkhan,," Excellent
","One of the most original and funniest shows in many years. In some ways
I liken this to a live Simpsons. It both encapsulates and exaggerates
real life. The family is a mess, but they do genuinely care for each
other.",/review/rw6529096/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2000,Op_Prime,," We have a winner
","Malcolm in the Middle is an incredible show. My feeling toward the show was rather mixed when they began showing promos. It looked funny, but silly and unoriginal. After all, the concept of a family that doesn't get along is nothing new. The show turned out to be better than I expected. It's not a live action version of The Simpsons like some critics claim, but it is very funny. Don't be quick to judge the show or you might find the jokes go over your head. Thumbs up on this one.",/review/rw6529096/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2005,MovieAddict2016,9," One of the funniest shows on television
","""Malcolm in the Middle"" may have lost a bit of steam recently, but some of the earlier episodes are absolutely, side-splittingly hilarious. Although Malcolm (Frankie Muniz) may be the titular character, it is really Bryan Cranston's characterization of the father figure, Hal, that makes the show so fun to watch. Cranston turns Hal into a boy at heart (as all fathers are) - only, like everything else with the show, extends it into a complete satire and goes completely wacky. This show, for lack of a better word, is crazy.",/review/rw6529096/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2012,Maniac-9,9," Hilarious show
","For whatever reason when the show originally aired I never watched it, but flipping through the channels one day I started to watch it then set it to record everyday and then eventually caught up with the whole series. The show is absolutely awesome with all the hijinks that Malcolm and his brothers pull. Plus Bryan Cranston is cast perfectly as the dad.",/review/rw6529096/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2015,TxMike,," 'At Lucky Eight, the ""L"" stands for VALUE.'
",I completely missed this TV series in its original run. For reasons I can't remember it just didn't seem like something I would enjoy. Boy was I wrong in that assessment!,/review/rw6529096/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2005,Mr_Sensitive,," It So Full Of Mischief That You Will Like It.
",This is without doubt the most entertaining family show on TV. Why? Because it not the same boring story that you normally see in family show Â– that at the end they will forgive and forget each family member for the wrong they have done.,/review/rw6529096/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2013,SnoopyStyle,8," Great group of funny people
",This is one of the funniest offbeat comedy about a lower class family. The family has 4 rumbustious boys. The oldest Francis (Christopher Masterson) is sent to military school. This leaves Malcolm (Frankie Muniz) as the middle child in the house. Reese (Justin Berfield) is the older and Dewey (Erik Per Sullivan) is the younger brother.,/review/rw6529096/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2000,Monika-5,," Like real life
","I like Malcolm in the Middle because the family seems so real. The kids fight and argue all the time and the mom doesn't let them get away with anything! All the kids, especially Frankie Muniz, look like just regular kids messing around, and not precosious, sheltered child actors.",/review/rw6529096/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2003,perni,," One of my favorite shows
","As of late, Fox Television has been relying on gimmicky reality series like Joe Millionaire and Married by Amercia to gets its high ratings. But the show I enjoy the most in their weekly lineup has go to be the always funny Malcolm in the Middle. First off, the entire cast is just superb. Frankie Muniz is cute, likeable, and gives the show a solid foundation. Justin Berfield and Erik Sullivan do just as well as the older and younger siblings. Dewey cracks me up sometimes when he has to take care of the father or finds his dark side (my favorite episode that was centered around the little guy has to be when he and the dad built a Lego empire that Dewey ran as dictator). And you can't leave out the parents, who are just as off the wall and hilarious. Francis shows up every now and then, but I tend to enjoy his wife Piama more than anything else about his sub-stories. What surprises me is how young the three main boys looked in the first few episodes. Frankie was just this chubby-cheeked tyke and so was Reese, but now Just Berfield has definitely bulked up (check out his shirtless scenes during the one episode where he feuds with Malcolm; yowza!), and Frankie has developed a very mature, handsome face. I'm kind of eager to see Frankie's latest movie, Agent Cody Banks, if only because he stars in it. Sure, it may not be Shakespeare, but it looks like good fun. As for Malcolm, I hope it keeps going for seasons to come. It somehow manages to be consistantly funny and fresh. 4/4 stars.",/review/rw6529096/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2020,Alec_Michael,9," Not Just Nostalgia
","This may very well be the greatest sitcom to ever be created. Many people argue that Friends, The Office, or Seinfeld are the best but nothing beats Malcolm in the Middle. It's relatability, perfectly executed jokes, and clever episode plots are just some of the reasons it's so great. It constantly finds ways to reinvent itself with episodes like Backwards Forwards, Clip Show, and Blackout. Anyone who hasn't watched this, I would highly recommend it.",/review/rw6529096/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2009,MMcDonaldFan,10," Delightful, Brilliant and Surprisingly Sophisticated
","I have only recently discovered this show, after years of having ignored it when flipping through channels, having written it off as ""a silly kids' show."" Now I consider it up there with ""Seinfeld"" and ""Scrubs"" in terms of its superb writing, creativity and savvy. ",/review/rw6529096/?ref_=tt_urv

21 September 2005,lee_eisenberg,," This show reminds my mom of her childhood.
","It's weird to think that in the past 20 years, only FOX (of all channels) has aired any good shows: ""The Simpsons"", ""The X Files"", ""That '70s Show"" and ""Malcolm in the Middle"". The last one shows the adventures of Malcolm Wilkerson (Frankie Muniz) and his wacky family. Disorganized mom Lois (Jane Kaczmarek), uptight dad Hal (Bryan Cranston), impulse control-lacking older brother Reese (Justin Berfield), and over-imaginative younger brother Dewey (Erik Per Sullivan).",/review/rw6529096/?ref_=tt_urv

8 June 2022,safenoe,8," Sublime and funny
","I remember my local station promoted Malcolm in the Middle as the human version of The Simpsons. I think Malcolm in the Middle can easily stand on its own feet (as much as a fan of The Simpsons as I am, particularly the first 10 seasons). The humor is cartoonish in a way, but edgy which cuts to the bone about families.",/review/rw6529096/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2020,pcampionz,10," What a Gem!
","Started watching these in order from the pilot, I have seen a lot of these over the years here and there, but I can't remember ever laughing so much! This series had the best chemistry with the actors, the finest writing, and is bust the gut
laughs in every episode. One of my faves is the one where the boys make up a bunch of dirty bombs with soiled diapers, dirty gutter water balloons, whole raw chickens, rotten eggs and cheese wiz bags and they build a large slingshot on the roof and fling them throughout the neighborhood at various homes and at people.",/review/rw6529096/?ref_=tt_urv

20 July 2006,steveoinsd,10," Must see TV.
","This is the only show that I cannot miss - even in re-runs. It is right up there along-side The Simpsons, 3rd Rock, and Married with Children for style, uniqueness and down-right hilariousness. The writing is amazing, the acting incredible and the characters have been mined from pure gold. I agree and disagree with the comparisons to the Simpsons. The shows are definitely on a par in terms of smarts and humor and the way the plots develop from seemingly random happenings are definitely similar. But to my mind the difference is in the way the jokes are presented: the Simpsons writers pummel you in the gut with punch after hilarious punch while the Malcolm writers hold your head and force you to watch while they cringe-fully punch each other. Genius pure Genius.",/review/rw6529096/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2019,KirkFogg,10," Thoroughly under rated and extremely relatable.
","What can be said about a twenty year old sitcom that hasn't been said already? This show debuted on Sunday January 9th, 2000 when I was in third grade. I had never seen a television show that not only starred the ""bad family"" in the neighborhood, but made them protagonists. Having grown up in a very loving but flawed lower middle class family constantly struggling to scrape by, this show really hit home for me growing up. Every episode is as cleverly written as it is genuinely hilarious and strangely wholesome. Malcolm in the Middle is a perfect representation of early 2000's television, and will remain a gem that stands the test of time. It's absolutely worth a full watch through on steaming services. If you're a fan of shows like Arrested Development, That 70s Show and Friends, I think you'll be a fan.",/review/rw6529096/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2005,worship_HIM97,," A good comedy that actually lasted
","It is January 9th of 2000, more than five years ago, and Fox viewers are waiting until 8:30 to see what Fox's new show Malcolm In The Middle is all about. Fox has referred to it as being a live version of The Simpsons, but would that really be true? Would fans come to admire Malcolm like they do The Simpsons? Well, that's why it was crucial to watch it, to see if it was going to be good.",/review/rw6529096/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2006,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,10," An absolute FOX classic!
","""MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE,"" in my opinion, is an absolute FOX classic! I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoy it. It's hard to say which episode is my favorite. However, I think it's always funny when a mishap occurs. I always laugh at that. Other than that, it's nice that just about every main character has stayed with the show throughout its entire run so far. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gives a good performance, the production design is spectacular, the costumes are well-designed, and the writing is always very strong. In conclusion, I hope this show will always live on in syndication.",/review/rw6529096/?ref_=tt_urv
