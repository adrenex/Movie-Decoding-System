12 November 2022,kylecurry,9," I am enjoying the show.
","I am enjoying this show much better than most police procedural detective shows. I see a few bad reviews here and the complaining of overacting or reducing religion to a cliché. But compared to ""law and order"" or some of the other mainstream shows, this holds my interest much more.",/review/rw8772027/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2022,TheReel14,9," If this was on Netflix or Prime the ratings would be higher
","So, i am half way through and just want to say this is one of the best murder mystery law and order csi criminal minds mentalist type shows to hit the mainstream in a LONG time. It is EXCELLENT. Every character every cop every story the intrigue the suspense. If this had come on Netflix instead of Peacock the world would go mad for it. Also as a UK viewer this is RIGHT UP OUR STREET. Its gritty, grown up, funny, broody. Honestly they better renew this bad boy for a few more seasons and also promote it better. The lead detective also reminds me of a young ben affleck but personality of the younger brooder new batman. Go watch it you will not be disappointed!",/review/rw8772027/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,nonsensefans,10," A very great series that people are missing out !
","How come this show has average ratings? It was very well developed, got an interesting character, & good paced, as well as entertaining storylines. I am very fond of the character, Detective Avraham played by Jeff Willbusch ., what a great character potrayal ! He could have wins awards for his performance. The cast are all pretty good & solid. It makes the shows different & felt real. There's a great dialogue & some intense scenes that makes you wanting for more. If you enjoyed watching intense crime procedural drama etc,. Mindhunters ,True Detective, The Killing , then this one is very well recommended. I hope this show would be continue for more seasons to come ! Just so I can watch the handsome leads some more.",/review/rw8772027/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,robinkelleher-36337,10," Magical!
","Finally!!! A crime drama with a twist! I binge watched this series with my family over the weekend. From the start I was captivated by Detective Avraham's character. I wanted to know more about how his mind worked, where his darkness and light came from, his background. He is such a complexly written and performed presence. Avraham's partner's quick wit and energy are great complements to his deep thinking and flashbacks. They are a great pair.",/review/rw8772027/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2022,chwechter,10," Excellent show
","Refreshing, inspired, quirky, engaging, new kind of cop show. The cinematography of the city is great(how could you not be pulled in immediately upon seeing the Brooklyn Bridge in all its glory). The characters are fascinating, the acting ever intense and amazingly real. The dialogue is reminiscent of a David Mamet screenplay. The stories are dark and completely compelling. I preferred the first case to the second, but both are excellent.",/review/rw8772027/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2022,gmak-70756,10," Love this show!!!
",I especially love the cast of characters and Michael Mosley is my favorite. Crime shows in New York can either be good or bad. There is no goofy unauthentic humor and each of the cast is flawed in some way. Next favorites would be Jeff Wilbusch and Karen Robinson. It is an excellent crime show with lots of twists to keep you wondering what is going on. David Kelley never fails us and I hope this show continues on with many more seasons. It is realistic with an interesting dynamic of how Jeff or Avi operates his investigation. This is definitely a binge watch series. My only complaint is there is not more of it!,/review/rw8772027/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2022,actonkat,10," Excellent
","This is not your run of the mill police procedural. It was very different and I enjoyed everything about it. The writing, the acting and the production were all very well done. Based on novels by D. A. Mishani, the plots are well-developed and the characters are unique. Each story has twists and turns that you don't see coming at you.",/review/rw8772027/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2022,bertrandma,4," Lukewarm Procedural with a thin Orthodox Icing
","I am totally hyped to find series finally making an effort (i.e. Under the Banner of Heaven) to treat religion as something else than either backwater culture or social pathology. I think the cop-thriller format is also very promising to explore the personal and introspective aspects of religion, which, compared to its collective or social aspect, rarely make it to the screen. Finally, I think Judaism is a rich and powerful tradition, at once familiar and strange ('uncanny') in our (post)Christian West, one deserving of more limelight than it usually gets (9 times out of 10, when Judaism shows up on screen, it's for a liberal Bar Mitzvah in an East Coast comedy). All this to say that I'm probably the right audience for this kind of show.",/review/rw8772027/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2022,tlarraya,1," Went downhill
","I´ve waited to watch the whole season 1 (eight episodes) before leaving this review in case it improved to match the good ratings but it does not. In fact, it starts better off and then goes down hill increasingly fast. The last episode was the worst as it got more religious. It looks like there might be a season two but I won´t watch it, that´s for sure. I wish I had watched something else. The actors aren´t good, the script isn´t good. It was fun to see one of the actors from This is Us and another from Entourage but the TV show just isn´t any good. It´s divided in 2 separate cases and the second is worst than the first.",/review/rw8772027/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2022,jeffpsy,8," A breath of fresh air
","Season 1 of The Calling, left me hoping for a season 2. While it could be described as an old-school police procedural, the unique characters on the police force and their interactions made this a thoroughly modern drama. The ethnic mix of the main characters was both striking and a reminder of how far TV has come in showing the diversity of real life: A spiritually inclined, orthodox Jewish detective, partnered with a private school educated black female, supervised by a crusty but wise black female Captain, created an interesting ethnic stew that enriched the show.",/review/rw8772027/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2022,scarlettjmolloy,8," Not a typical American Cop Show

3 January 2023,d_penn,4," N/A
","""The Calling"" refers to Avi's life mission to solve cases and help people. However, David E. Kelley, who has notable experience in this genre and style of stories (L. A. Law, Boston Legal, Big Little Lies), fails to capitalize on the essence of Avi's supernatural powers in his storytelling. This Peacock drama falls a bit flat due to this lack of spark and distinguishment. Even with two cases in a single season, Kelly seemed short of time in the end. The uneven balance between story and exposition left the overall appeal of the show hanging by a measly thread of Jeff Wilbusch's sturdy portrayal. Although we never get the sense that things were rushed, some more episodes could have seen the above play being more balanced out. The Calling does not meddle too much with story elements. It remains foremostly a police procedural drama with shades of psychological turmoil and suspense.",/review/rw8772027/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,matt-24001,6," If you like network TV police procedurals........
","If you like corny network TV police procedurals like Law and Order (which is referenced at least 6 or 7 times), then this is for you. Unlikeable characters, two different plots in the series which are both unrealistic and silly, and a cast of characters perfect for a CBS miniseries. If you love good dramas on Netflix, Prime, HBO, Showtime, Paramount Plus, avoid this one at all costs. If you are bored out of your mind and want your intelligence insulted, this is perfect for you! It's unbelievable how 'lazy' tv has become across the board, which is probably why we are all spending way too much on subscription services.",/review/rw8772027/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,ctipton1,5," High expectations ruined by a arrogant, self righteous, know it all partner.
","Why do the series writers think it is necessary to write a smart aleck unlikeable female character. Janine Harris is so abrasive and unlikeable she takes away from the story line. This is not a strong woman she is a cliche. She is supposed to be learning from her partnership with Avi but she belittles him, his religion, and his skills. She has little respect for her colleagues and her barbs are cheap shots. In old stage terms she is a ""ham"" trying to steal every scene with her not so witty lines. If the writers can tone down her nastiness and add some intelligence to her character the show may service another season.",/review/rw8772027/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2022,julieshotmail,8," We are treated to another David E. Kelley production
","David E. Kelley has a knack for putting out whodunnits, the highest profile of which is ""The Undoing"" on HBO starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant. Now we've been getting a weekly dose from ""Big Sky"" on ABC, not quite as high quality but fun enough to keep going for three seasons. ""The Calling"" emerges on Peacock in late 2022, and oh wow the first couple of episodes are alluring, thanks to the ambience and the captivating actor Jeff Wilbusch. As you go through the eight episodes, you notice that the difference in quality between the early episodes versus the later episodes is quite remarkable. That's because in episodes 1 and 2, we get treated by the direction of Barry Levinson of ""Rain Man"" fame. No wonder those first two episodes are so good. The show is still interesting towards the end but becomes no better than the format of ""Big Sky."" I am still a fan, just astounded at how a series can vary in quality so quickly over the course of one season.",/review/rw8772027/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2022,kourosh-92137,3," A dark show to destroy your faith in humanity
","This show is a strange combination of display of faith, while at the same time attempting to destroy your faith in humanity. The premise of the show - an orthodox Jewish police officer is fresh and exhilarating. The main character shows genuine compassion to all of the perpetrators and victims, and the mixing of Jewish tradition throughout the show is both educations and interesting.",/review/rw8772027/?ref_=tt_urv

","A very compelling tv series offered up in a time where there's so much media content available in our lives now! The cast and the crew who wrote and directed this series have a gem a tv series! I mostly try out tv series and if I'm not able to like the actors chemistry and the shows premise within d the first episode or even in the first fifteen to twenty minutes , I'll immediately not continue watching said tv series! This tv series got me immediately invested in the lead characters and the whole cast as a whole! Well done and the writers have done an amazing job & the actors and Hell the whole crew have Gem here!

7 January 2023,da-449-192643,6," Could have been better without much effort
","It's a well made show in almost every aspect with good suspension, storyline with flashbacks to fill in the as the story develops. The focus on suspension and plots twist might be overdone from time to time as it creates a vacuum instead of an eerie feeling.",/review/rw8772027/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2023,dgpluche,7," Good criminal/detective show
","I was looking for a ""new series"" to watch. I bought an app to watch the World Cup and after it was done I noticed that they had a few series in there too. I read the description for this series and I decided to give it a try. I end up liking it very much, I don't know much about the Jewish community but I find it very interesting, and you mix that with a detective work and you will get a pretty good show, entertaining, intriguing, and keep you wanting to see the next episodes. Unfortunately is only one season but I really hope they come up with more of them for us to enjoy. If you looking for something new to watch I will totally recommend it.",/review/rw8772027/?ref_=tt_urv
