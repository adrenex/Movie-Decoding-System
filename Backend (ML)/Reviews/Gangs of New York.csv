26 January 2003,Buddy-51,," great filmmaking overcomes banal story
","Finding yourself brooding over the sorry state of civilization lately? If so, I would strongly recommend you take a trip to `Gangs of New York' and see how much worse things USED to be in the not too distant past.  The film is Martin Scorcese's epic paean to the Lawlessness That Made America Great, a theme most often explored against a Far West backdrop, out on the open prairie or in two-bit towns like Tombstone, Arizona or Dodge City, Kansas. Here it's been transferred to 1860's New York City, which in Scorcese's vision, turns out to be a veritable Dickensian hellhole of vice and corruption, a place teeming with rival gangsters, pickpockets, corrupt politicians, lawbreaking policemen, and even firefighters so obsessed with matters of jurisdiction that they do physical battle with rival departments while an unattended building goes up in flames behind them.  This is a world where life has no value and where a man's existence can be snuffed out without so much as a by-your-leave or a single person left behind to mourn him.  The members of these rival gangs make the Sharks and the Jets - who would make their appearance on the same turf a full century later - look like mere pantywaists in comparison.",/review/rw0684459/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2021,AlsExGal,5," This tale of the Five Points seems pointless
","It was like Inglorious Basterds to me. Great individual scenes, but mashed together in an unfocused way, especially the third act where Scorcese decided the riot was going to be the main character instead of Amsterdam and Bill.",/review/rw0684459/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2003,slimjack,," Terrific Entertainment!
","Gangs of New York is just perfect entertainment. It is an enthralling, bloody, melodramatic epic that more than justifies its two and one half hour running time. In Gangs director Martin Scorsese spins another tale of the New York underworld but with a twist. Instead of the mid-twentieth century organized crime milieu of Goodfellas, Scorsese ventures back to the 19th century to show us the origin of the modern street gang.",/review/rw0684459/?ref_=tt_urv

","Daniel Day-Lewis elevates this film from just ""good"" to ""very good"" or even ""excellent."" He is absolutely riveting, one of the most interesting ""villains"" I have ever seen on film. I am sorry Day-Lewis didn't win the Academy Award for his performance. He was just outstanding to watch. His facial expressions alone cracked me up!",/review/rw0684459/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2006,bob the moo,," The narrative and characters are weak but the general sweep and spectacle of the whole thing makes it worth a look
","In the 1840's New York is a mess of gangs all fighting over small areas of turf. The main rivalry is between the immigrant Irish and those who see themselves as Natives of their New York. A battle rages between them and the leader of the Irish (Priest Vallon) falls to the blade of Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting  witnessed by Vallon's young son. Sixteen years later and things are different but no better. Cutting is now the head of the Five Corners and all the gangs answer to him. It is into this situation that an unknown man called Amsterdam returns  none other than the grown son of Priest Vallon. Seeking a fitting revenge for the death of his father, Amsterdam makes sure he catches Cutting's sole eye and gradually is taken into his trust.",/review/rw0684459/?ref_=tt_urv

But in order to get his vengeance, he must infiltrate the Butcher's gang, and ends up becoming something of a son to him.",/review/rw0684459/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2003,=G=,7," Over-wrought melodramatic history-fiction mishmash.
","""Gangs of New York"" mixes real American history with a weak fictional human drama and a thick coat of Hollywoodization resulting in an over wrought behemoth wannabe epic misfire. Scorcese pulls together bits and pieces of the Civil War  conscription act, Irish potato famine immigration, Tammany Hall  and Tweed corruption, race/slave issues, slum gangs, etc. and creates a milieu which has an off-target post-apocalyptic sort of feel and then tries to cram DiCaprio down our throats as a hero though he does nothing particularly heroic in the context of the film. The flick features blood and guts street riots reminiscent of ""Braveheart"", a romance which doesn't work, an evil guy over acted by Day-Lewis and little else save a whole bunch of filler to give us a taste of the times and milk the extravagance for all its worth. In spite of all that, ""Gangs..."" received several Oscar noms and a thumb and a half up from critical corners with so-so approval from the public. Okay for fans of the principals and others into Hollywood blockbusters. Not for the jaded or those looking for substance or sophistication. (B)",/review/rw0684459/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Gangs of New York"" takes us back to a time when America was a young country and New York was divided.  Those who felt they were ""native"" Americans did not want immigrants to enter their great country, spawning hatred between groups all over the city where many of them landed.  In the story we see how much of the town is run by one man, with William Cutting (""Bill the Butcher,"" played marvelously by Daniel Day-Lewis) being the most feared and well-respected man of the ""five Points.""",/review/rw0684459/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2003,aleator,5," Dodgy accents...dodgy acting.
","The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis stands out from what is a seriously flawed movie. Leonardo DiCaprio is seriously miscast,the story is hardly inspiring and the film suffers from problems with continuity. All of the cast look far too well fed and healthy to be the poorest of the poor - and did they really live in subterranean dwellings that look like caves? Scorsese is a great director but his preoccupation with the low life seems morally repugnant here. Historical accuracy goes out the window as the gang members are portrayed in a semi-heroic light. The love interest grafted on in the shape of Cameron Diaz is pathetic. A lot of praise has been heaped on the film's attention to period detail and there are indeed some interesting observations - I particularly liked the 'Allsorts' barrel in the bar wherein all the slops are thrown to provide a cheap drink. However it was impossible to avoid the impression that you were simply watching a crowd of  extras parading around a large film set in period costume. Every scene was laid on with a trowel.",/review/rw0684459/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Gangs of New York"" goes a lot of places but it never really goes where it should. It starts up slow, it gets slower, and ends really fast, too fast. For two and a half hours we are dragged through relentlessly gruelling scenes that pay no purpose to the film, and then the last ten minutes, the most vital point of the entire motion picture, the point where we are so hyped, pumped and ready for a big payoff, anything big, something big...fails. It quickly accelerates and ends with U2's award-winning song ""The Hands That Built America,"" and the fancy-schmancy, slow-to-fast credits start rolling.",/review/rw0684459/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm not exactly sure whether this should have been a film or a mini-series, either way, I am left with the felling that I've missed something. Yes, there where great actors, a great director, props, costumes, so on and so forth... but where is the glue that holds it all together? At a distance, it is the story of a boy seeking vengeance for the murder of his father and the inhumane treatment of his countrymen, yet it is also about war, racism, poverty, romance, and the list just goes on and on. I understand the significance of all of these factors, but I want vengeance. Did I want to watch two and a half hours of him climbing up the social ladder, just to fall all the way off, then two seconds of vengeful fury? Not really.",/review/rw0684459/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2009,tburke85,8," Gangs Of New York A Solid Action Crime Drama
","Gangs Of New York is a solid action crime drama from director Martin Scorcese who continues to show his skill as a filmmaker with this film. The cast are admirable in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day Lewis, and Cameron Diaz. DiCaprio is great as Amsterdam Vallon a man seeking revenge against the one who killed his father. DiCaprio may not have the flashier role like Day Lewis but he's still believable as the hero bringing that intensity he's been know for to the character. Daniel Day Lewis gives a knock out performance as Billy ""The Butcher"" Cutting a psychotic gangland kingpin who killed Amsterdams father. Day Lewis is terrific in the role of a man whose willing to kill anyone without hesitation. The people are either with him or against him there is no middle ground. Cameron Diaz is good as Jenny Everdeane a woman willing to do almost anything to survive and a potential love interest for DiCaprio's Amsterdam. John C Reilly, Jim Broadbent, Bredan Gleason, Henry Thomas, and a brief appearance by Liam Neeson are effective as the supporting characters but most of them don't have much to do and aren't in it much either. All of them still turn in solid performances none the less in their limited screen time. Most of the movie takes place in New York during 1863 when one of the worst riots in American history took place. The fact that this really did happen gave the movie a realistic fool especially the location where they chose to have this film take place giving audiences a look at what it could've been like back then in New York. The action sequences which mostly involve people getting beat up in brutal ways are well executed especially the riots at the end. The showdown between Amsertdam and Bill was a bit of a letdown but it was fitting for the movie. The film was a bit long with a running time of 167 minutes. The pacing was a little slow at times but the performances by the cast make it worth watching anyway. Despite some flaws Gangs Of New York is still a well made crime drama with enough action, some suspense, a little humor and romance. So if you can get past the long running time Gangs Of New York is definitely worth watching and most of that besides what I already mentioned is because of the exceptional performances (especially Day Lewis and DiCaprio) by the lead actors and the amazing talent of Scorcese who continues to prove himself as a gifted filmmaker with this movie. Well done.",/review/rw0684459/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2002,giancarlorocks,8," NOT A MASTERPIECE, BUT A GREAT 'HEAVY' FILM...
","For all its' Uber-violence, 'Gangs of New York' is a majestic piece of filmmaking. Director Martin Scorcese reunites once again with Editor Thelma Schoonmaker and Production Designer Dante Ferretti thusly recreating a potion of a country's history spectacled with infestation, disease and rampant violence. These are but some of the characteristics employed in an unconventional manner in hopes of telling a memorable story. Scorcese displays to the filmmaking world how imaginative he can be with his long overdue, epic and costly motion picture based upon a time in New York City's history where violence was not sporadic, but a necessity for survival. Set directly in New York's Five Points District, on a micro scale the film tells the vengeful story of Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo Di Caprio), a young man who returns 16 years after being banished from Five Points after witnessing his father's defeat at the hands of a vicious rival known as Bill The Butcher; infamous for his fixation with the meats and his innate sense of slaughterous murder. Upon Amsterdam's return, he has but one aim  - avenge his father's death at the hands of the vicious 'community leader' William Cutting,, a.k.a. Bill The Butcher. Cutting prides himself as being a sadistic and remorseless thug who surrounds himself with the filth of the community in order to profit himself and his political allies. Daniel Day Lewis comes out of seclusion for a craft he apparently dislikes and simply nails this performance as a sophisticated and well-spoken murderer who has no parameters nor morals to bound him. He fights for the Yankee Way and opposes anyone who threatens the American lifestyle.",/review/rw0684459/?ref_=tt_urv
