11 February 2001,FlickJunkie-2,8," Easy to like
","Director Amy Heckerling knows a thing or two about high school flicks, having directed the highly successful `Fast Times at Ridgemont High'. Heckerling put her talents to work thirteen years later for the next generation of high schoolers, writing and directing this hilarious satire of life at Beverly Hills H.S.  Heckerling takes a different approach from `Fast Times', which found its comedy in the absurdity of reality, depicting situations into which teenagers really get themselves.  Here Heckerling's comedy mostly comes from mocking the superficiality of the high school `in-crowd'.  While this is not the first time this has been done, few have ever done it with such blistering wit.  This film became the standard for a spate of 1990's high school flicks set on the west coast that borrowed many of its elements.",/review/rw3381043/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2022,kevin_robbins,9," This is a very well done picture that is an absolutely must see
","Clueless (1995) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched on HBOMAX. The storyline for this picture surrounds Cher, a upscale high school student with good grades, looks and lots of money. As she looks for love she's also happy playing match maker for her friends and a particular new student. As everyone starts finding love she finds herself starting to get jealous.",/review/rw3381043/?ref_=tt_urv

11 August 2008,Chrysanthepop,," An Excellent Modern Teen Adaptation Of Austen's 'Emma'
","Just the other day I watched Heckerling's wonderful romantic comedy satire 'I Could Never Be Your Woman' and I thought I'd revisit 'Clueless'. The last time I saw it was 10 years ago and today I enjoyed it just as much. Heckerling's adaptation of Jane Austen's 'Emma' may appear like a fluffy teen flick on the surface but there is a lot more to it. It works on multiple levels and 'Clueless', in a way, is a social commentary as it reflects a reality that still exists in today's society. First of all, the teen life is very realistically portrayed albeit with a sarcastic tone (such as the striving for high grades, obsession with image and partying). It somewhat reminds me of 'Heathers' (another excellent teen satire). While 'Heathers' is a much darker film that looks at teens in the 1980s, 'Clueless' looks at the adolescents of the 90s. Moreover, Heckerling brilliantly uses different kid of comedies through one-liner and dialogue, situational, and slap stick.",/review/rw3381043/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2001,moonspinner55,6," A refreshing change from the John Hughes/""Breakfast Club"" generation
","Silky-smooth, vanilla-coated pleasure about matchmaking in modern-day high school. Far from the insufferable smugness of all those '80s teen-flicks, ""Clueless"" is bright--in both senses of the word--clever, funny, fanciful and yet grounded in reality (a rich one). Alicia Silverstone is adorable, but the supporting cast is affable and seemingly carefully-picked (they all get their share of funny lines, particularly Dan Hedaya superb as Silverstone's father). Seems more inspired by Jane Austen's ""Emma"" than based upon it, with a few mean-spirited lines but plenty of lightly innocent laugh-getters. **1/2 from ****",/review/rw3381043/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2005,MovieAddict2016,7," Clever spin on Austen's story with good satire and performances
","Cher (Alicia Silverstone) is a popular ditz at her local high school in Beverly Hills. She's a spoiled, pampered little princess with all the right social connections and endless wealth. However she has yet to find a man in her life - all the Baldwins (as she and her clique of friends call guys they like) have been taken.",/review/rw3381043/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2001,Spleen,8," Cluey in spite of its cluelessness
","""Let's set 'Emma' in a modern high school!""  Does this sound the obvious kind of movie gimmick that everyone uses nowadays?  Perhaps, but it's an inspired idea all the same.  Jane Austen's characters, and her readers, and the society in which her novels are set, like Jane Austen herself, are HEAVILY conscious of class and social standing.  No atmosphere quite so snobbish exists in the modern world.  EXCEPT, that is, in the corridors and courtyards of the right kind of high school.  And where else in the modern world would you find so many people who seem to spend all their time calling on one another?",/review/rw3381043/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2022,Mr-Fusion,7," Better late than never
","Considering how long removed I am from both the '90s and high school, there's something entirely relatable about Clueless - and I'm as surprised as anyone. Alicia Silverstone is beyond charming and there's plenty of humor in the supporting cast as well (in particular, the late Brittany Murphy, incandescent in her own right). But the dialogue really put me back in that high school mindset, and I think the movie strikes a nice balance between satire and teen fluff. Like Mean Girls, this is a movie that I've dismissed over the years for being shallow, and for the life of me I can't explain why. This is good stuff.",/review/rw3381043/?ref_=tt_urv

",": Catching up with the recent Emma. made me even more resolute in rectifying a huge void in my pop cultural catalogue and finally getting round to watching Amy Heckerling's Clueless. Based loosely on Jane Austen's novel 'Emma', it came at the beginning of that run where the high school movie was coming back in fashion with the likes of American Pie, and where it was co-opting classic literary narratives to freshen the brew - 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' for Get Over It, 'Pygmalion' for She's All That, 'Twelfth Night' for She's the Man, and 'The Taming of the Shrew' for 10 Things I Hate About You.",/review/rw3381043/?ref_=tt_urv

29 March 2005,sol-,8," My brief review of the film
","A generally quite well made, enjoyably stylish and interesting matchmaking tale aimed at teen audiences, the film manages to incorporate a number of very clever parallels to Jane Austen's matchmaking novel 'Emma' while also providing a good satire on high school life. The idea is somewhat simplistic, the plot is sort of predictable, and the young performers all look too old for their teenage characters, but these are all minor vices against this strong entry for the teen flicks genre, with a surprisingly very realistic and actually almost heartfelt performance by Alica Silverstone to top it all off.",/review/rw3381043/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2014,utgard14,7," ""We might get Marky Mark to plant a celebrity tree.""
","A fun teen comedy from Amy Heckerling, the director of the woefully overrated Fast Times at Ridgemont High and the first two Look Who's Talking movies. Clueless is the best thing she's ever done, in my opinion. It put Alicia Silverstone on the map. Well, that and Aerosmith videos. Silverstone is pitch-perfect as Cher, the role of her career. It's impossible not to like her in this movie. It's also pretty much the best thing Stacey Dash and Breckin Meyer ever did. Not to mention the first big role for Paul Rudd. As most everyone knows, it's based on Jane Austen's ""Emma."" For a teen comedy, it's refreshingly smart. The story may not be all that but there's lots of good dialogue rather than a string of F-bombs or Stifler-like characters. One of the few memorable '90s comedies.",/review/rw3381043/?ref_=tt_urv

22 August 2005,Travis_Bickle01,7," A pleasant surprise
","I wasn't expecting much of this movie, until I started seeing it. It turned out to be quite entertaining. ""Clueless"" is about the shallow and rather stupid rich girl Cher Horowitz, who only cares about herself and how popular she is. But then she starts this kind of 'project', together with her best friend. One of the aspects of this project is about making a new silly girl of their school look as 'cool' as they are. This 'silly' girl is very well performed by Brittany Murphy. I hardly recognized her! ",/review/rw3381043/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2013,tavm,9," Having finally watched the entirety of Clueless just now, I found it quite charming despite the now-dated references
","Well, after nearly 20 years of only seeing certain scenes in this movie (I was working as an usher when this came out and snuck in some movie-watching time in between shows), I finally watched the whole thing with my mom just now on Netflix disc. In short, this was quite a funny movie about teens in the '90s with many of the now-dated references and cultural fashions not too much of a deterrent of a still-enjoyable story inspired by Jane Austen's novel Emma (though I can't believe those below-the-butt styles of today was actually quite the style then as well). Alicia Silverstone is both at her prettiest and charming in the lead role of Cher, the shallow teen thinking she's all that but also good at heart. Brittany Murphy is also great as Tai, the new girl who blossoms under Cher. Too bad her life was cut short a few years ago. And director Amy Heckerling, already an expert on depicting high school situations having previously helmed another classic called Fast Times at Ridgemont High, outdoes herself here as a writer as well with the material the cast is given. So on that note, Clueless comes highly recommended.",/review/rw3381043/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2006,lee_eisenberg,8," offers some clues about the future
","Teen comedies are quite common, but ""Clueless"" has going for itself the fact that it transposes Jane Austen's ""Emma"" to mid-'90s Beverly Hills and plays with stereotypes there. We see how air-head Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone) may not have a clue about the rest of the world, but her heart is always in the right place - maybe a little too much. And of course, who can forget how the movie introduced to national dialogue phrases like ""as if"".",/review/rw3381043/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," Fun satirical chick flick, loosely based on Emma.
","I really enjoyed Clueless... I found it fun, charming and easy to like. It is loosely based on Emma, and while some of the book's issues are put across here, like social standing, the story was updated to make it appealing for teenagers, and it ticks almost all of the right boxes. A perfectly cast Alicia Silverstone positively sparkles in the title role of Cher, and she is further advantaged by a funny well-written script, a classic heart felt story, and very good performances from her co-stars, such as Brekin Meyer and Brittany Murphy. The direction by Amy Heckerling was also spirited. The film looks lovely, with very nice costumes and locations. My only two criticisms are that the film is a little long, and once or twice only when the story almost falls into predictability. Overall, a fun, engaging and well acted film, that I would definitely watch again. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw3381043/?ref_=tt_urv

16 March 2018,Serenityinaz12,9," Finally saw it after 20+ years - wow was this good.
","The movie - I thought this would just be a dumb chick flick and that's why I never saw it with my buds in high school when it came out, even though I was in love with Alicia like everyone else. But it's not that at all, just saw it a few weeks ago and it's just this fun and loveable movie that is light hearted and really funny. There is no big villain to overcome and the lead character is strange in a good way in that she is the ditzy rich popular girl but she is not mean and is actually really caring and helpful towards others. The cast is great and a lot of the lines are really funny. I lol'd HARD more than once. And I think the amorphous thing about the movie that is really key is just that I felt happy and in a great mood while watching and afterward. I've since watched it more than once and each time it just puts me in a great mood!",/review/rw3381043/?ref_=tt_urv
