26 August 2019,oneill2424,10," Wow! What a Surprise!
","Saw the previews when it came out and I had absolutely zero interest in seeing it because I thought it was a typical Hallmark lovestruck type movie (yuk)... WRONG! Don't listen to the cold-hearted critics because they're WRONG! I loved the performances, the writing, the locations. I love movies that keep you guessing and go back and forth to cause a little confusion, and then, BAM, it all comes together! I didn't see many of the twists coming and the last moments of Rodrigo with his mother took my breath away. Her words mean so much to me because we are going through that same thing in my own family. See this movie. Take it for what it is and be prepared to feel. We all need to do that once in a while, don't we?",/review/rw4357072/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2019,eseptember,9," Much more than what you'd expect
","At the time when I watched this, the rating was 6.6. I hope it gets higher after people discover more of Dan Fogelman thanks to This Is Us, because this rating is just not fair.",/review/rw4357072/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2018,ari_nelson,9," Ignore the critics and the soulless...
","...because I'm glad I did!!! For some baffling reason this has low IMDB rating...I almost didn't watch because of this and boy I would've missed out on yet another brilliant Dan Fogelman story. Crazy, stupid love happens to be a go-to movie of mine and This Is Us is one of my favorite tv shows. So my husband and I gave Life Itself a whirl hoping for something similar in style. I'm pretty sure my heart exploded with emotion...in the best possible way. I LOVE movies that make me emotionally vulnerable (like opening montage scene of UP!) and this movie nabbed at every emotion humanly possible in 90 minutes. My combat veteran husband (who keeps his emotions on reserve, mind you) said, and I quote, ""Next to A Star Is Born, this is the best movie I've seen all year."" On top of that, the acting is superb. Grab some tissues and enjoy.",/review/rw4357072/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2018,shailee-71432,10," Beautiful
","I went out of my way today to review a movie. Something I have never done before in my life, but I felt I had to. I saw a review after watching the movie that made me upset. A reviewer said it was sad people called this movie entertainment when they didn't even watch the first five minutes of the movie. I was upset by this because I experienced this movie in a completely different way. This movie does an amazing job of portraying how life is terrible and wonderful and unexpected all at once. It shows how so many lives marked with tragedy can lead to something beautiful. I'm sad for anyone who is too small minded to understand and appreciate what this movie is trying to do. Amazing cast, great director, beautiful camera work and a captivating story. I loved this movie.",/review/rw4357072/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2019,yada2121,10," Life Itself is about Life.
","Tragedy may knock you down. But you get back up again because all the little parts of all those who came before you are inside of you, urging you to keep going. I have always wondered how people survive the tragedies in their lives. Families with lots of love do it all the time. Even best friends too. Now, I understand how the love and the memories can transcend the tragedies. Take us beyond the tragedies. And why we all must never dishonor those who have touched our hearts by forgetting about them. Because life is never forever. But it's best parts can be passed on to those you love and shared with those who loved you until the day they died. This is the power of this movie.",/review/rw4357072/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2018,oobrimah,10," A Great Dramatic Epic
","This movie is a great dramatic epic because the dialogue is great. The 'Book Thief' is a great dramatic epic because of it's excellent character development, essence of a literary novel or movie. 'Life Itself' does not engage in character development, yet you feel endeared to the characters because they somehow are defined by their dialogue. Never seen a movie soften an adverse event as much as this movie does, with outcome you focus on the good that could come out of the adverse event. Don't know why they threw in that 'goddamn' at end of the movie, but I overlooked it and gave it a 10 anyways.",/review/rw4357072/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2018,pantickatarina,9," Beautiful!
","I was apprehensive going to the movies because the movie is neither popular nor well-reviewed. What a surprise! I both laughed and cried in my seat. It has a beautifully written script, the story is original, emotional and immersing. Yes, it is messy at times, but so is life. I loved how it all tied together in the end. I felt that there are many many sentences from that movie that will soon be legendary.",/review/rw4357072/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2021,jaimemedina-36288,9," The unreliable narrator
","Once every 10 years or so a movie like this comes along and reaches into your chest and rips your heart out. It shows it to you - bloody and still beating. It is brutal, relentless, and beautiful, and it is a work of art.",/review/rw4357072/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2018,ferguson-6,7," cross-contient ripple effect
","Greetings again from the darkness. The theory is that heavy dramas find it challenging to attract an audience during times when real life and newscasts are filled with daily downers. One need only tune in to the local news to see that we are in just such a ""downer"" period right now, and it would be difficult to argue that this latest from writer/director Dan Fogelman (""This is Us"") is anything but the weightiest of heavy dramas - with an emphasis on the preciousness of time and life.

19 September 2018,Mystic1000,10," You Either Get It Or You Don't
","No super heroes, no car chases, no revenge , no wild cgi effects, no apocalypse, and no lurking undead.
Just superb layered storytelling, fine acting, and a message about the dilemma and the magnificent potential of human beings (if we choose it).
If that's not a message that interests you, or you have some pre-set bias around the way Fogleman famously evokes emotional themes, then do everyone a favor and don't show up. If, on the other hand, you do not fear your vulnerabilities and can stretch yourself to some artistic license that doesn't involve space ships or old men who bounce off pavement (I'm looking at you Tom, Liam, and Bruce), then I dare say you could really like this movie.
I was lucky to get tickets to an early screening and I look forward to watching the IMDB number on this film go up and up.",/review/rw4357072/?ref_=tt_urv

13 March 2019,peterp-450-298716,8," I know the critics say it's crap. I love a movie filled with emotions. Sue me. I'm an emotional guy.
","So, what does that tell us?
That the only truly reliable narrator is life itself.
But life itself is also a completely unreliable narrator
because it is constantly misdirecting and misleading us and taking
us on this journey where it is literally impossible to predict where it's
gonna go next.",/review/rw4357072/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2018,kryzhan,10," C'mon Guys
","Beautifully put together film, superb acting, editing. The low reviews are shocking but yet again not. People. Didn't read the book, if there is a book. Don't need to do a mental comparison or have some expectation. Went in blank sheet and wife and daughter came out hugging after all three of us had our moments of reflection and tears during and after the film. You need to savor this film. Of course you'll figure out what you think is going to happen and that's okay. That's life. Life has its patterns and surprise moments that do indeed happen. It could happen and it does happen. Enjoy the film if you are an emotional person, a deeper person. C'est la vie... Just let go and enjoy the film.",/review/rw4357072/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2020,maccas-56367,9," An emotional rollercoaster far better than critics suggest
","I think your enjoyment of this film depends on how much you have been truly living life.

","Unpredictable, emotional, well- written dialogue, heart felt performances. When I read the bad reviews I was in shock. How can anybody not love this movie ? It touches on the essence of relationships, from the happy moments to the tragic moments. Please ignore the bad reviews and give this movie a chance. It deserves it.",/review/rw4357072/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2019,roxlerookie,8," Interesting how much pro critics, users reviews, and IMDB score vary, no?
","Interesting how much ""professional"" critics, users reviews, and IMDB score vary. That itself tells you there's something special about this movie. I thought it was excellent. It takes you on a fast & violent emotion roller-coaster, and yes, statistically some of the plot is unlikely, but the emotions rung true to me, and I don't care about statistical anomalies if they serve the story. Quite a few reviews compare this to a French movie, though I'm unsure what that means. I'm French, and I'm surely biased, but at least it's not soup: it's drama. The movie clearly offended a lot of people, which is ironic, because that's the point the movie's making: life is fierce, and it's beautiful.",/review/rw4357072/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2020,henrycoles9,10," A beautiful intersectional plot
","This is one of those movies where things happen to two different families that eventually lead them to run into each other, and frankly this story was a masterpiece of such intersecting plots. They did a great job with the editing and the Spanish sequences starring Antonio Banderas were very endearing and heartwarming. My only complaint is that I wish there was much more of Oscar Isaac and Olivia Wilde. They are both exquisitely well suited to such intricate and touching drama and I am sad I couldn't get enough of them. But, given how wonderfully the movie touched my heart, that wouldn't make a dent in my 10/10 rating.",/review/rw4357072/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2019,gemleighc,10," Watch it first... then read why I gave this a 10
","This is my first film review. I never write reviews because I don't really agree with the ones I read. This movie had bad reviews but I knew in my gut I wouldn't agree with them, and I was right!
As I sit in my house in silence, straight after watching Life Itself, I think about my own life. I'm 35 years old and married to my true love who I met only 6 years ago. A few years before that I would pass this house regularly, not knowing the family that lived inside whilst I was in a toxic relationship that would turn into an even more toxic marriage. 7 years ago, on this very day, I left that marrige not knowing that I would end up in that house, loving the man that owned it and the children that eventually would become like my own.
Coincidences happen, even bizzare ones like the one that ends this movie.
Life Itself is a BRILLIANT movie. It moved me to tears. It made me laugh. It entertained me. It broke my heart. It left me with questions. It gave me answers to questions I'd not even asked.
Just like life itself.",/review/rw4357072/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2020,toncincin,9," Loved it!
","It takes a while to figure out what's going on (similar to ""This is Us.""). But I loved the way the stories started intertwining after the first chapter. I wasn't sure about the part of the story in Spain (which is why I gave it a 9 instead of 10) - but it all came into focus in the final chapter. What a magnificent portrayal of how our lives cross - in sad AND happy moments. I will be watching it again.",/review/rw4357072/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2018,Harry-22,10," A Cure for All the Junk Out There
","The negative reviewers reminded me of the John Cheever story, The Worm in the Apple. It seemed that each of them was trying to ""one-down"" the last, suggesting that it was the worst thing since Miracle Whip. Yes, there is a lot of tragedy portrayed, but then again that's life, itself. Well acted, well written, and well directed, forget everything you've read and give it a chance. I didn't feel manipulated, I didn't shed a tear, but I didn't mind being bathed in melancholia for two hours while the pieces of the story came together.",/review/rw4357072/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2019,RickVee,10," Truly wonderful movie
","That professional movie critics critics hated this movie is all the proof you'll ever need to realize how useless, soulless and up their own backsides professional movie critics are. Make no mistake - this is a fantastic film with a lot of heart. The acting is top notch. The songs and score are superb. But the best thing about the movie is how they convey the movie's overall theme/message - that life is unpredictable, often times cruel and sometimes beautiful. They convey that is so many very memorable scenes. Do yourself a favor and sit down in a dark room with a glass of wine and watch this film. By the time the end credits are rolling you will be in a stunned silence at what you just experienced.",/review/rw4357072/?ref_=tt_urv

23 September 2018,Jmccullaugh5,10," Are we that desensitized as a society? WTF?
","This movie was hands down one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Would highly recommend. I have to think the only people giving this movie a score lower than a seven, are desensitized and are probably embarrassed that they cried at a movie, would be my guess. It was amazing. The only reason you wouldn't enjoy and appreciate this movie and its message, is if you literally do not have a soul.",/review/rw4357072/?ref_=tt_urv
