24 December 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Action Packed Thriller!
","The Last Ship follows a destroyer named the USS Nathan James, led by Capt. Tom Chandler (Eric Dane), as they try to save humanity. They search for a cure to a virus that has already wiped out more than half the population. Against orders they stay at sea to develop the vaccine. They also have to fight off enemies who will do anything to get that vaccine or try to stop them from finishing it. I really enjoyed this show a lot more than I thought I would. It has the perfect blend of action, drama, comedy, mystery, twists, etc. Eric Dane and Travis Van Winkle lead a fantastic cast that all are at the top of their game. Bottom line is it's a pretty good action thriller that will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. It's definitely worth watching. If you're looking for a fun show that has plenty of action which will keep you at the edge of your seat then give this a try. You won't be disappointed!",/review/rw3075282/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Better Than Expected!
","I really enjoyed The Last Ship a lot more than I originally thought I would. I originally started watching this just to kill some time and because I read good things about it and the next thing I knew I was addicted to it and binged it as quickly as I could. I thought after the first season they would run out of ideas and the show would drop in quality. It didn't, if anything it only got better as the show went on. This show has the perfect blend of action, drama, comedy, mystery, twists, etc. Eric Dane and Travis Van Winkle lead a fantastic cast that all are at the top of their game. Bottom line is it's a pretty good action thriller that will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. It's definitely worth watching.",/review/rw3075282/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2022,karenbridget-01788,8," Entertaining escapism.
","Just recently watched all the seasons of The Last Ship with my husband. Many on here moan about some things not being realistic and far fetched, but I really don't care. Don't take it so seriously!! It was entertaining, enjoyable and had plenty of action. I like watching all different genres, and enjoy them for different reasons. This was good escapism which is enjoyable at the moment when there is so much depressing news these days. I liked the cast and cared about the characters. I'm English and found the two English baddie character's cockney accents to be quite unconvincing, but I could get past that. Some seasons were better than others, but I was never bored and I enjoyed them all generally. Worth a watch!!",/review/rw3075282/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2022,thenitkumar,9," Massively Underrated Show
","This was and continues to be one of the most underrated shows that I have watched up to date. Firstly, I have to specify that I am a big fan of military shows or movies so my review might be a little biased but to each they're own i guess. Secondly I have to stress the fact that Eric Dane (Tom Chandler) has done a REALLY good job in this show. The story is written in such a way that it keeps us on our toes and unable to guess the following story. The only two black marks for this show is that they kind of left Rachel Scotts murder with a sour end. It felt like none of the characters really cared that she had passed and the show just continued on like nothing happened. Further the ending of the show was finishing off fairly well as far as the story was concerned, however I felt that the story ended in kind of a dead way and they didn't show much of post-war like where all of the crew ended up. All in all this was an amazing show and if you have the time, do watch it. Highly reccomended!",/review/rw3075282/?ref_=tt_urv

10 September 2018,SpanishDann,6," 80's/90's throwback
","I've watched this show since the beginning, though I'm not sure why. It's mediocre at best, but I guess it's better than most other programs on TV. It reminds me alot of those old shows from the 80's and 90's like a Magnum PI or the A-team, with a little Rambo thrown in there. That can be good or bad depending upon your perspective. Episodes are shallow, stories are predictable, and the theme is always America = good guy, the rest of the world = bad guys. Latin America, Russia, China are the most prominent targets, which again is reminiscent of Rambo or Schwarzenegger 90's flicks. ",/review/rw3075282/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2018,Glodar322,4," 10/10 for season 1 and 2, after that show is just something else and it is reason for 4/10 for complete show.
","For me this show was true to its name till Season 3+, I like to pretend that it ended few minutes into last episode (finale) of season 2. If I'd review 1st 2 seasons, this would 10/10 show, living up to it's name, but after, season 3+ everything went downhill, like it's completely new show, well in my opinion it is, and it should been new show, new name for show because has almost nothing that made him great, and it is not true to it's name, they should have end show season 2, and make sequel with new name to have season 3+ as it's own show then maybe no one would complain, it would get new crowd, that would not be let down when show is not really ""The Last Ship"".",/review/rw3075282/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2014,tmf084,7," not too bad ...
","I was expecting a run of the mill drama with a portrayal of the Navy similar to what we saw on JAG or NCIS and that's basically what it is. My main reason for watching it in the first place was Mitra and Baldwin and overall I was positively surprised. It's not edgy, extraordinary or comes up with it's own new ideas but it's a very well executed and produced TV show with a cohesive plot and character depiction and some nuances of development. Baldwin, Dane and Mitra carry this show and they do it well. Some of the scenes can be quite cheesy with all the patriotism and military tradition going on, but overall they found a good balance between the cheesy stuff, action, drama and progress in the story. Also the quality is very steady, so if you watch the pilot you get the gist of the show.",/review/rw3075282/?ref_=tt_urv

","Though some of it can be a little stereotyped, this is an entertaining show if you like the military and a relevant pandemic scenario.",/review/rw3075282/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2022,robfollower,8," Don't forget about Sasha Cooper, played by Bridget Regan S3-4-5. She kept me coming back.
","S1 and 2 was great television! Season 3 was one of the series best !! As season 4 & 5 progressed the show kept reinventing its self as it leaned into more military action . The viewer still had a cast of characters to get behind and rally for to keep one engaged. It doesn't mean it wasn't good. It definitely is. It's just not what people expected. I stuck it out for all five seasons, each season is reasonably self-contained.",/review/rw3075282/?ref_=tt_urv

",Its hard to say anything positive about The Last Ship. They story line taps into the now long running virus end of the world scenario. The difference on this occasion is the survivors are a bunch of US navy types accompanied by a British scientist and her sidekick on a ship. ,/review/rw3075282/?ref_=tt_urv

6 September 2020,Helismoke,9," A Surprisingly Addictive Hoot and Holler!
","I started this show to kill some time. A Pandemic here is almost unbelievable until it actually happens, who would have thought? But the continuous surprising events that come from every corner kept me coming back for more. And the fact that almost every crewman does something heroic in the series is admirable! And as I thought the series was ending, a new dreaded world crisis and another season! Pandemic to famine to dictator with the Captain ( And crew) being tested at every episode.",/review/rw3075282/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2016,insideout098,5," Ship without a purpose sails away
","What happened to this great show? In the beginning, there was the Nathan James, a naval destroyer alone in a vast ocean, it's captain and crew trying to unscramble the nightmare that spread across the planet in the form of a deadly virus. Then the creator of the antivirus is killed off, the world goes back to doing what it always does, which is capitalizing on pain and power, and the ship is left without a purpose as the entire world descends into chaos that no anti-virus in the universe can save. What show runners need to understand is why viewers abandon their series in droves. People get hooked on shows because they like the plot structures, the elements of place and time and the main characters. Once any one of those elements is either diluted or lost, people wonder what show they're watching. You must always go back to where you came from unless you want to lose your core audience. How difficult is this to grasp? How many shows have suffered similar fates for the same reasons? Remember your roots and stick with them.",/review/rw3075282/?ref_=tt_urv
