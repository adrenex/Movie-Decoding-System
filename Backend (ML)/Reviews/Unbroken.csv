24 January 1999,CuriosityKilledShawn,6," Snake is Back, baby
","Summer 1996 really was NOT the right moment to bring back Snake Plissken. America was caught up in Olympic fever and was riding the mad, patriotic wave extremely high with the release of ID4 and other huge action hits such as Twister and Mission: Impossible. A sobering reality check of the grim, forthcoming future instigated by a hypocritical government with a cynical, outcast anti-hero was NOT what anyone wanted.",/review/rw1386538/?ref_=tt_urv

","Escape from LA follows almost exactly the same plotline as Escape from New York; A city has become a colony for criminals, something gets lost in the city, the government don't have anyone but Snake Plissken that is able to get it back, so he goes in, has a few misadventures with the locals and eventually brings it back.

25 July 2003,a_forbes,7," Cheesy, unrealistic, outdated and fun!
","Sure, Snake Plissken is a relic from the ultra-macho 80s action craze. Sure, Carpenter's use of effects is often obvious (though occasionally brilliant). Sure, the film is nothing but a slab of highly fragrant cheese, but it's FUN cheese. It's unapologetic cheese. It's the extra $1.50 of gooey, greasy, slimey mozza that you throw onto your 16"" meat-lover's... sure, it's excessive--maybe even unhealthy--but it makes the pizza.",/review/rw1386538/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,6," ""Sounds familiar.""
","That sums up one of the most undeniable aspects about this flick: It is enormously reminiscent of the first. Whether or not that's a negative thing is up to the individual. It still holds great surprises, and is definitely a fun ride. There is more satire in this than the first. The tone of this is often overdone and campy, in stark contrast to how serious that of ""New York"" was, and there are those that will miss that. This is humorous, if a few gags and jokes fall flat. Everyone but Russell(who nails the part again) is newly cast, and the choices are all fitting. This has some rather memorable occurrences(a couple of them for sheer weirdness and imagination), and certainly puts several breathtaking visuals up on the screen. The effects vary, though there are excellent ones herein. Dialog has quotable lines, and is well-delivered. The music is cool. Cinematography and editing are marvelous. The acting holds good performances. While it does bear a striking resemblance to that of the original movie, the script of this is interesting, creative and well-done. It has a nice pace, and you gotta admit that it's packed with action. Each sequence is exciting and intense, and differs from the rest in some way. There is strong violence and language in this, as well as disturbing content. This is bigger than the '81 film. Unfortunately, it also cost a larger amount of money, and only made about half back. It's too bad that Carpenter's work has a tendency to not be appreciated by the masses(only the fans and/or cult following) when it is initially released. I recommend this to anyone who wishes to watch it, the two aforementioned groups in particular. 6/10",/review/rw1386538/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2014,badfeelinganger,10," "" The more things change, the more they stay the same""
","Both Escape from New York and Escape from L.A. are decidedly anti-establishment films. They both have this cynical view of the government; in these films, the government is not to be trusted. There are terrorist attacks aimed at the government on both films. ESCAPE FROM L.A This second one is tongue in cheek every step of the way. Watching Escape from L.A. feels like watching a cheap Italian Rip Off like 2019: After the Fall of New York (1983), but with a bigger budget. Actually, Escape from L.A. has a lot of similarities with 2019: After the Fall of New York, so in a way, this is Carpenter's pay back for all those cheap Escape from New York rip offs that the Italians made. Ultimately, I love both Escape from New York and Escape from L.A. for different reasons. And for all the tonal differences between both films, they still have many similarities. No matter where, Snake Plissken will always be Snake Plissken, you can tell Russell has lots of love for this character. Plissken is what kept me watching. The opening and closing segments of the films are extremely similar as well. And here's where we get to the best part of the film, the ending. Not gonna spoil it don't worry, but I will tell you that it is the best thing about the movie. Russell himself came up with it and I applaud him for it, it encapsulates everything Snake Plissken is in terms of attitude. That idea that maybe the world would be better off if we simply started again, from scratch, screw the way things are, let's try something new! Welcome to the human race my friends, welcome to the human race.t does criticize fascist forms of government, it also criticizes rebellious leaders who instigate their followers towards committing violent acts. So it doesn't side with anyone. On this film, both sides are wrong. The film pleads for a new beginning, it's asking governments to forget their old grudges and start from scratch. Snake himself says it in one scene: ""I shut down the third world, you win, they loose. I shut down America, they win, you loose. The more things change, the more they stay the same"" This is one of the ideas presented in the film that I truly liked. The idea that both sides should just call it quits and bring on the peace, bring on the freedom. Again, this last bit demonstrates how much of Kurt Russell's Libertarian views are on this film. After all, he wrote a lot of it himself along with John Carpenter and Debra Hill. These are three life long buddies writing a movie they would find amusing, which makes this film a labor of love. This is probably why the film has a more laid back, 'were having fun here' vibe to it.",/review/rw1386538/?ref_=tt_urv

27 June 2007,dr_foreman,3," Can't touch the original...
","""Escape from New York"" is by no means a classic film, but it's memorably dark, seedy, suspenseful and even funny. You might call it a worthy cult favorite.

7 July 2004,megavenganceman,6," Misinterpreted and underrated
","Now ""Escape from New York"" is a darker, grim action thriller that suits the environment where the story takes place. When one thinks of New York, you think of a dark, seedy, big, bad city. This is not what comes to mind when one thinks of L.A. You would think sunny, plastic and strangely creepy. Hence the change in tone with this looser, tongue in cheek near self-parody. Now the reason why I say the film still works is Snake Plissken. The only character who is played completely straight against the stable of B-movie cliches and skewed Hollywood stereotypes. Maybe in a few years this film will gain the respect it deserves. Still, although I reasonably enjoyed the picture (especially a few choice cuts like the ""Bangkok rules"" scene) I must admit I liked the first one better too.",/review/rw1386538/?ref_=tt_urv

","this sequel to ""Escape From New York""isn't half bad.it doesn't have the gritty,unpolished look of the original,and it's not as edgy.however,i did find it more humorous,and it's more of an action adventure movie,than pure drama,unlike the the original.the movie had a lighter feel to it.i didn't find it had the same sense of loss and decay.i did find it entertaining,and fairly fast paced,though there were a few mildly ridiculous scenes that felt out of place.i also noticed(as anyone who watches it will)that the general plot line was almost a carbon copy of the original,with a few variations in detail.i still liked it,and thought it was as good as the original,though,like i said,if you're expecting a departure from the formula of the first,you won't find it.For me,""Escape From L.A. is an 8/10*",/review/rw1386538/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 1999,kheops,10," That's how we should speak about freedom of creation
","Snake is back, and they shouldn't have tried to f*** with him. This movie is one of the best sci-fi movies these years, because first it's not serious at all, we see that John Carpenter is one of the most creative directors in the world in general and in USA in particular, that's why this movie didn't work, he doesn't have limits to his purpose, to the characters, he dose what he wants, and that's why he's not appreciated as he ought to be. That's also why he's appreciated here in France, we appreciated the character, Snake Plissken, very independent, not like those fake heroes as in ID4 or ""Armageddon"", Snake Plissken is a kind of anarchist, nobody can make him do what he doesn't want to except if his life depends on it. He's called to save the world, he says f*** off. The end of the movie is one of the best ends of a movie in these last years. The cast is really good, with of course Kurt Russell, Steve Buscemi and Pam Grier (wow!) in a different role than ""Jackie Brown"" but the end is why I loved this movie, I didn't know that there were still free men as Carpenter in art creation in the USA.",/review/rw1386538/?ref_=tt_urv

","Escape from LA (1996) is a movie in our DVD collection that I recently rewatched on my DVR after recording it on RetroPlex. The storyline for this picture finds our government once again needing the assistance of Snake Plissken to prevent a dooms day device from getting into the wrong hands; and if it does, preventing it from going off. Now Los Angeles has been blocked off from society due to their lawless ways so Snake will need to navigate an apocalyptic landscape to accomplish his task.",/review/rw1386538/?ref_=tt_urv

","Snake, the man with the patch is back doing his thing in what used to be LA and he strolls down what is left of Wilshire Boulevard and takes time to shoot hoops at the Coliseum. Snake, (Kurt Russell) enters into the 9.6-quaked Los Angeles of 2013 in order to retrieve a black box which is a sort of end of the world device. Snake has friends and foes, Steve Buscemi, Peter Fonda, Stacy Keach, Cliff Robertson and a good actress Pam Grier. There is also plenty of action where Snake dive-bombs a Happy Kingdom theme park. The ending of this film is perfect and I enjoyed this film as much as Escape from New York. John Carpenter & Kurt Russell did a great job in the production and directing.

","Despite being one of the worst sequels a major Hollywood studio has produced ESCAPE FROM LA gets off to a fairly good start as we see an earthquake hitting California , but unfortunately the film plays out almost exactly like ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK , and I do mean exactly . For example Snake is given a mission in LA which has been turned into a prison just like in the original , he`s injected with something that will kill him if he tries to abscond just like in the original , he faces conflict in an arena just like...

9 October 2008,poe426,10," Escape From New York plus...
","I ventured, at the time of its release, that ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK might one day prove prophetic (as had THE CHINA SYNDROME). Then came Ronald Reagan and his Reaganvilles and John Carpenter's poke at it all, THEY LIVE. Roddy Piper and Keith David were struggling to survive (as were we all) in the Reagan Republic. In the end, of course, it turned out that the Moneyed Folks were in on the coming alien takeover. When Carpenter more or less followed up, years later, with ESCAPE FROM L.A., he and co-writer Kurt Russell envisioned a U.$. Theocracy in which personal freedoms were being whittled to nothing- by Law. At the time of the movie's release, I was urging everyone I knew to see it. Unfortunately, most of them saw it as nothing more than a remake of ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. Which means they didn't really get it. I argued that this was a movie that, like the 1984 version of NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR and THX-1138, was a movie that needed to be seen by everyone in this country.

","I don't think there's a better movie describing today's atmosphere in America and you can easily forget Escape From New York cause its political themes are pretty much restrained. Also Escape From L.A. is kind of timeless in a way that it satirizes all what America is known for, from motorcycle gangs, hookers, Hollywood agents, face-lifts, politics, freedom, violence TO implied peculiar American (created) all movie genres (sci-fi, action, comedy, western) to movie characters (typical US movies bad guys/good guys), music (typical western score, typical US orchestrated score), dialogues, typical US action movie scenes and especially parodying Hollywood stupid copycat sequels.

","Escape From L.A. (1996): Dir: John Carpenter / Cast: Kurt Russell, Stacey Keach, Peter Fonda, Cliff Robertson, Steve Buscemi: Crappy excess in filth that rehashes the superior Escape From New York. Here the future Los Angeles 2013 has been separated by an earthquake and anyone who breaks a moral law is sent there. The President sends Snake Plisskin to L.A. to find his daughter, kill her, and retrieve a satellite control box she had. He is injected with a virus, which is another dead steal from the first film. John Carpenter pretty much directs his worst film with this piece of garbage. This is from the same director who made one of the great horror films in Halloween. Kurt Russell reprises his role as Plisskin and appears to be more super human. Stacey Keach plays the stereotypical villain who attempts to render Christianity the bad guy. Peter Fonda has a useless role as a surfer as a bad send off to his Easy Rider performance. Also featured is Cliff Robertson in not one of his best moments. Steve Buscemi plays a character named Map Of The Stars Eddie. If that is the case then perhaps Buscemi should fire his agent. Escape From New York wasn't the best in terms of special effects but it had a genuine futuristic vision and intriguing characters. In this forgettable sequel the special effects are horrible within a film that belonged in a junk yard, preferably burned within a pile of every other existing copy.

","John Carpenter's ""Escape From New York"" wasn't bad, and was a hit movie, but this sequel - some 15 years later - is pathetic....and one of the most offensive anti-morality films I have ever watched. The hero is typical Kurt Russell (until the last few years when he seems to have mellowed in his roles): an anti-hero, anti-social and super macho man. The storyline of this movie is so anti-God, anti-Christian, anti-family, etc., that is is past ridiculous and downright laughable it's so absurdly left wing. This film should be put in vault as Exhibit A of exactly how much hatred the film industry has against God and Believers.
