28 February 2005,BrandtSponseller,8," Not my favorite Lynch film, but very good and intriguing
","After two brief scenes that at first seem unrelated to the rest of the film, we see a dark-haired, obviously rich beauty in the back of a limousine. Her driver stops at an odd location on Mulholland Drive, which is a twisting, thickly wooded two-lane road full of mansions overlooking Los Angeles. Just as her driver and another man in the passenger seat turn around to kill her, two drag racing cars from the opposite direction come crashing into the limo. Only the dark-haired woman survives. She works her way down the ridge to Sunset Boulevard and hides in a vacationing woman's apartment. Shortly after, Betty (Naomi Watts), the vacationing woman's niece, shows up at the apartment and runs into the dark haired woman, who now has amnesia. The bulk of the first part of the film is Betty and the dark haired woman trying to figure out who she is, why people were trying to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a strange key in her purse. This is interspersed with oddly surreal threads about Hollywood producers and directors, with occasional forays into a land of hoodlums and prostitutes.",/review/rw2761185/?ref_=tt_urv

","'Mulholland Drive' resembles a detailed painting, one that is better understood with repeated viewing as more details are discovered. Though the story's straightforward, it unfolds its layers with each viewing. It resembles a beautiful dream/nightmare. The varied camera-work, the haunting score, the effective lighting and use of colour, the amazing art direction and special effects are all part of the stylish execution. The acting is overall excellent. Naomi Watts completely nails her part with a nuanced performance of a tormented character. Laura Elena Harring is sensational as the sensual Camilla. Justin Theroux and Ann Miller are superb in their strong parts.",/review/rw2761185/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Mulholland Dr."" is something else. It is a film that will make you question your own sanity in many ways. Naomi Watts is the young, starry-eyed Canadian that wants to make it big in Hollywood. She is naive and thinks that dreams can come true if you want them bad enough. Watts discovers a very beautiful woman with amnesia (Laura Harring in a sizzling performance) in her aunt's house in L.A. and she becomes determined to help Harring out. Harring is mysterious and her near-fatal car crash occurred on the dark and winding Mulholland Dr. Throughout several oddball and very dark scenes take place. A young director (Justin Theroux) learns that Hollywood is run by strange underworld figures that are quiet, but ruthless. Another strange side-story is the mysterious man behind the diner that is seen in another character's dreams. An inept assassin also runs around causing unwanted trouble for himself and others. Then of course there are cameos by Robert Forster and Billy Ray Cyrus. The film twists into darkness as it progresses as Watts' and Harring's relationship turns sexual. A fine line between reality and fantasy is skewered and it comes down to a strange Pandora's box that holds the true secrets to ""Mulholland Dr."". Oscar-nominated director David Lynch also shows that not all you see and hear is real, even though one's mind might think so. The film seems artificial at times, showing Hollywood as a nice place where dreams can come true. But then the dreams are turned into vivid nightmares of what could possibly be the true reality. David Lynch somehow makes this whole thing work and he makes it work beautifully in this reviewer's opinion. The film is a trumped-up version of ""The Twilight Zone"" and it adds many techniques that made Alfred Hitchcock the true master of suspense. Many wonder what this film is truly about. I am not sure. I am not sure Lynch even knows, but I am going to give it a shot. ""Mulholland Dr."" is the dark side of the human condition. It is a film that shows how easy one can lose one's soul if bad elements are let in. There are figures that seem somewhat supernatural to me in this movie. It seems that many of the characters are ""messengers"" that are all after one thing: Naomi Watts' soul. Watts lets the elements in and in the end she cannot overcome them. What she thinks she wants seems attractive on the outside, but there are cobras on the inside that will be too strong to fight off. In short, ""Mulholland Dr."" is a brilliant piece of film-making and it is brilliant due to its unique aspects and the fact that it is what one thinks it is. There is no right or wrong answer and it is a film that makes you think. ""Mulholland Dr."" is a complicated puzzle for the minds of cinema fanatics. 5 stars out of 5.",/review/rw2761185/?ref_=tt_urv

","Originally filmed in 1999 as a TV pilot, ""Mulholland Dr."" was rejected. The next year, David Lynch received money to film new scenes to make the movie suitable to be shown in theaters.

29 April 2005,zolaaar,10," Mulholland Drive? That's where I was going!
","The case history of 'Mulholland Dr.' is known: What should had been another excursion (after 'Twin Peaks') into the rivaled field of TV-series ended up abruptly after completing the pilot. It was too risky and twisted for the producers to venture an investment. Lynch used all the filmed and cut material and started new shootings to finish a completely new feature film. The result: One of the most impressive cinema experiences of this decade which can be ranked among the best works of David Lynch. His earlier movies 'Eraserhead', 'Blue Velvet' or 'Wild at Heart' kept aloof in an irritating way which hustled the viewer into the role of a voyeur, but never involved him as part of the plot happening such as here.",/review/rw2761185/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 2011,gigan-92,6," ""I had a dream about this place.""
","Mulholland Drive ( David Lynch, 2001), one of the most ambiguous films to be unleashed upon contemporary audiences, dare one say ""abstract"" even. In an era where simplicity is preferred over mystery and intrigue, the average audience member may find such a film angering in all respects. It resembles the classic noir genre, in so much that the infamous street Sunset Boulevard even appears in the movie as an ominous homage to the Billy Wilder film of the same name. Like that 1950 film, this movie's themes and tone is dark, but nowhere near as formulaic, per say. Classic film noir still relied on a certain pattern of events and character niches; the femme fatale, the unsuspecting victim most often our male protagonist and of course the incorruptible detective figure. This narrative method follows the invisible style, making it generally easy to understand. Mulholland Drive breaks many of these rules without a second glance, clarity being at the very bottom of its intentions if at all. Director David Lynch sets this in motion in a number of ways.",/review/rw2761185/?ref_=tt_urv

","""twin peaks"" and ""blue velvet"" have always been two of my favourite pieces of film-making, and even though past films by lynch have been slightly disappointing for me they have always been worth watching a number of times.  to be pretentious, lynch can be like a good wine - he must be savoured and mulled over.  but in the end you must make up your own mind about what you have seen, for lynch never gives you the full answers.",/review/rw2761185/?ref_=tt_urv

","As is often the case with a movie I don't understand upon an initial viewing, I head on over to the FAQ page for the film here on IMDb and read what's available to see if there's any kind of analysis or explanation of what happened. That would be an excellent start for anyone curious about this movie. But then, upon a second viewing of this picture the very next day, events in the film, both the dream sequences and reality became much clearer. Not only that, but the way the story was plotted and presented was proven to be downright exceptional. I think ""Mullholland Drive"" is a mind bending spellbinder that you won't forget long after you've seen it, no matter whether you loved it or hated it.",/review/rw2761185/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2014,TheLittleSongbird,10," One of David Lynch's best and one of the best of the decade- not for all tastes though
","I found Mulholldand Drive to be a fantastic film, having loved all of David Lynch's films seen personally so far (personal favourite being The Elephant Man, one of the most emotionally affecting films ever made) with the exception of Dune. For this viewer, Mulholland Drive is one of Lynch's best films and among the best films of the 2000s, but it is also one of Lynch's most love-it-or-hate-it films- from a love/hate him director- as seen in the reviews here. And it is very understandable why people would dislike it, it is weird (not unusual for Lynch), it is slow, the story mayn't be clear to some, the symbolism may go over people's heads and it does get confusing especially towards the end. And it has nothing to do with not getting it, it is just not for everybody's tastes and not everybody is going to connect with it. For those who love it neither of these are problems, admittedly it is a good idea to be acquainted with Lynch's style beforehand so that it doesn't come across as too much of a shock and also to watch it more than once. Justifying what was so great about Mulholland Drive, a good place to start would be the visuals, which are never less than scintillating with bold colours, symbolic imagery and some of the most striking cinematography of any film from this decade. The Silencio Club scene is so beautifully shot. The haunting retro score, thought-provoking dialogue and that it contains some of Lynch's finest direction and the best directing of all the films from 2001 are further things to like. The story is where those who dislike it are perplexed, granted there may be too many plot strands crammed in towards the end and not everybody's going to like how the ending is open to interpretation, but with me the thriller-drama story was gripping and I was captivated so much by the surrealist atmosphere, offbeat emotional intensity and sizzling suspense that the slow pacing didn't feel slow at all. It wisely focused on the relationship between Watts and Harring, and while bizarre it was very well handled. The cast carry the film brilliantly, especially with the sensational lead performance of Naomi Watts who has never been better than here. Laura Harring is enchanting and Justin Theroux is very good. In conclusion, while not for everybody's tastes for understandable (and quite obvious) reasons Mulholland Drive was fantastic in all areas. 10/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2761185/?ref_=tt_urv

","A lot of people say that 'Rosebud' is the greatest mystery from Hollywood, but actually I think that Mulholland Drive is. I've never experienced anything quite like it. Its plot is slow-moving and sometimes feels unconnected to anything, yet it's too engrossing to look away. Mulholland Drive is one of the most intriguing films I've ever had the pleasure to watch and it's one that demands viewing multiple times. It's that type of film where you think that everything will be explained to you at the end (like The Skin I Live In) however, being a David Lynch film, this doesn't happen and the film is all the better for it.",/review/rw2761185/?ref_=tt_urv

","David Lynch has an instantly recognizable style with his ambiguous extreme close-up shots, deep and rich colors and slow, dream-like dialog. Mulholland Drive uses these to great effect and has a good story to boot. The film will leave you asking many questions, or just baffled beyond words, but if you re-watch it, look for the right clues and have a decent understanding of symbolism and storytelling techniques, it's possible to decipher the meaning of the film.
