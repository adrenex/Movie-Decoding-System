21 January 2022,tobiasdernbrant,3," Doesn't make the books justice
","The story i way to complicated to cover in just over two hours. The story feels rushed and there is no time to build up the characters. Poppe has lade a lot of changes from the books for the worse. The actors for Karl-Oskar and kristina doesn't have any chemistry, it doesn't feel like the love story of the books at all.",/review/rw8731255/?ref_=tt_urv

28 May 2022,Movie_Reviews,1," Feminists destroyed yet another masterpiece
","In the collective Swedish mind ""Utvandrarna"" from the 70s is one of the best Swedish movies/series ever made. And it is. Fast forward 50 years and they boil that epic series down to two hours and with the focus of both sexes having equal air time and dialogue. All that was good has been lost, in other words. In the name of feminism.",/review/rw8731255/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2022,vidar85,1," Pure waste of time - Watch the original movie instead!
","I've both read the books and seen the original adaption of the books by Jan Troell. Now that adaptation has it all; great acting, evocative settings and fantastic cinematography. Amongst many things. This new adaptation lacks it all. Both Skarsg√•rd and Carlehed (male and female lead) are theatrical in their acting, thus making their performance forced and unnatural. The pace in the narrative and shift of scenes is uneven. Crucial parts of the story telling that connects the plot and makes every piece fit together are missing.",/review/rw8731255/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2022,multirational,3," Unnecessary film
","Added nothing to the already existing adaptations, and lacked the essence of Mobergs original masterpiece. Went into the movie theaters with an open and curious mindset, left it unsatisfied.",/review/rw8731255/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2022,diddo-67060,1," Terrible acting
",I am so to have seen such a beautiful story by actors who doesnt for one single second feel autentic for the 1800s. It feels like they just stepped of the Subway and put away their ipads.,/review/rw8731255/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2022,spunkkalle,2," How to destroy an epic masterpiece
","This movie has slaughtered the books an original series of Moberg just to update the story and strengthen the female characters and the diversity. The hooker is the smartest, the native Indians are helpful and peaceful. Alfred is true feminist. I am sorry but I am not a big fan of woke movies changing the reality of life in the old days.",/review/rw8731255/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2022,Minnesota_Reid,8," Coming to America
","This version of the classic story centers on the wife, rather than the husband, and it works very well. You get a real feel for the scariness and loneliness of being the first homesteader in an area. You also get a strong feel for the contradictions of a tight-knit faith community: its enforced conformity versus the sense of belonging.",/review/rw8731255/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2021,cnspeeri,9," Great adaption of Mobergs masterpiece
","Poppe did catch the feeling and the essence from Vilhem Mobergs books with telling the story with his own words, the great author would have been proud.",/review/rw8731255/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2022,slarson-2,8," Ignore the haters!
","It is really sad when reviewers can not get past their prejudices to objectively review a film. Yes there was a great first version. Yes there are the beloved books. However whether you love the film or not, it is not a 1 or 2! I saw with a group of diverse people and all very much enjoyed, including the teenagers. We saw beauty, drama, loss. Congrats to all involved.",/review/rw8731255/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2022,elvis_sturesson,1," Thumbs down!
","Worst movie I've ever seen. Missing a lot in the movie, which was in the book. Like, for example, Karl-Oskar's brother Robert and his friend Arvid or Kristina's uncle Danjel. Lucky I have the original films with Max von Sydow and Liv Ullmann.",/review/rw8731255/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2022,sofia_stenroos,3," Ruined the books
","This film basically tried making a two hour movie out of four epic books, and failed miserably. The story is so convoluted that the only premise left from the books is that they emigrate from Sweden to America. Characters are cut, rearranged and now only the first couple emigrates. The moviemakers have basically ruined these books.",/review/rw8731255/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2023,mynameisniclas,2," It is not the story you think of
","This movie promises alot since it has borrowed its name from the epic story by V. Moberg. Although some of the characters from his book are in the film, this is another story, which is much much thinner.",/review/rw8731255/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2022,peterkristiansson,1," It hurts..
","I'm so sad how they brutally destoyed the books and older serie. I could explain every small part that doesn't make sense or are worse then that, but I don't want to waste more time.",/review/rw8731255/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2022,lotta-71476,10," A wonderful and exciting story of emigration to America
","I really enjoyed the movie. Movie has different phases: The difficult times before the moving, the dangerous trip across the Atlantic and the challenges to build a new life in US - all these have their unique athmosphere and the viewer can feel their fear, passion, confusion and longing for better.",/review/rw8731255/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2022,Betzenberg98,1," Historically Innacurate, Poorly Written & Acted.
","As a Swedish-American from Chisago County who grew up loving Moberg's books and the Troell films, this film was an absolute shame to watch! It misses nearly every mark, from the filming locations to the acting and sequencing. Somehow, the characters of Karl Oskar and Kristina were made completely lifeless. All of Moberg's research and painstaking efforts from the 1940's that helped create an authentic version of the Swedish immigrant story gets thrown out of the window! Why are we shown huge mountain ranges, steep valleys, and waterways that bare no resemblance to Minnesota and the upper midwest? The actors failed to shed their 21st century mannerisms, unlike Max Von Sydow, Liv Ullman, and the rest of the original cast who were able to play the time period. It was like watching a bunch of high school kids with a sugar high put on a play for their parents. Awful film!",/review/rw8731255/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2022,chamithkandamby,7," Creating a nation
","The main character of the movie is Kristina the beloved mother and wife who had a highest respect for the religious matters and the traditions of her nation. She carried an enormous burden for being a dutiful wife to her husband and to her Swedish society. And above all she was always act for her children's safety and wellbeing. But ultimately, she decided to let all the burden to be released and feel the life for the sake of herself.",/review/rw8731255/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,kevinlindlago,9," One of the best ones this year
",This movie is so tragic and beautiful at the same time. I haven't seen the original one or read the book so I can't compare. But the movie itself is one of the best Swedish movies I've seen! You have to see it.,/review/rw8731255/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,tobias-160-448561,2," Perfect example of modern soulless filmmaking
