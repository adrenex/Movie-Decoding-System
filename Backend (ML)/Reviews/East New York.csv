3 October 2022,PardonTheTruth,8," We needed a show like this
","East New York is off to a solid start. There's a very strong NYPD Blue and Hill Street Blues vibe to it. I grew up in a neighborhood a lot like this one and the realism is palpable. Poor people doing what they can to get by, grinning politicos whose only objective is lining their pockets, etc...
But this show is not in any way a downer. It presents a group of flawed characters who all bring substantial baggage to the table. The reliable Jimmy Smits and Amanda Warren are perfect in major roles. Old pro Richard Kind plays the usual idiosyncratic character that always fits him like a glove. Let's hope it's not a flash in the pan.",/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,freddy_at_home,8," I like it and I'm going to keep watching every week!
","I tuned in for the first episode without knowing much about this. I like shows like Chicago PD and Chicago Justice (so sad it got canceled) and Blue Bloods, even if it's a bit cheezy with all the saints stuff.",/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2022,nasimzhosein-695-794748,8," Disregard the bad reviews
","It's another cop show but this time it has some character and realistic story in the episodes. It's so nice to see a female lead as the commander and how she portrays herself is admirable: respectful, firm and fair. Unlike the other cop show FBI where the female lead is disrespectful, rude and obnoxious in the show but i do think that's her normal characteristics.",/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2022,maryhei,8," Unclear ending
","I'm a senior citizen, and I really appreciated the mature characters in the show.... It has the makings of a great show..... It has intelligent dialogue, interesting plot lines, and characters the viewer actually cares about.....",/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2022,danjarnutowski,8," Pretty good
",Not without flaws but I felt some solid emotions out pilot. Nice diverse cast. So far i like all the characters which is rare. A cop show that just feels different in a good way. Hopefully it does well. I like the cop deputy/chief/I'm not sure if I got the title right. She's tough but shows emotional consideration. And just has a personality i don't see that often. I can see this show going places if it paces well and avoids predicatability. I'm curious about where the characters will go. The pilot has set up a lot so it will be interesting how they unfold going forward. I'll be watching and seeing if it meets up.,/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,mysafetyemonline,9," Not Biased Political Woke Cop Show
","The FBI TV SHOWS are predictable and focus on insulting and misrepresenting GOP as supremicists or crazy gun toting anarchists...show after show. NCIS has become ritualized, where the storyline goes you can predict, down to the minute. CSI at least has interesting science, though improbable, and also predictable down to the minute (write down what time in the show when each obvious plot turn happens, it is the same every episode. Maybe a computer writes them? The soap opera relationships are boring too.",/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2022,clkmellang,9," It's Good
",I love cop shows. Been watching them a long time. I'm particularly fond of Chicago PD right now. But East New York is kind of different. In a good way. I really like Amanda Warren in this role. And Jimmy Smits is always great. Olivia Luccardi and Ruben Santiago are standouts as well. It's fast paced but also takes time with the characters. It has the usual 2 to 3 situations the officers are dealing with per episode. It's got a good vibe to it. I hope the writers stay true to the storylines and characters. I'm impressed so far. Give it a shot. Looking forward to episode 3. Go East New York!!!!!,/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,pietclausen,2," Two is enough
","A police series is always pleasant to watch with interesting stories, so I was eager to experience this new tale. The first episode was okay and introduced some of the characters. But not knowing East New York I did not expect it to be a racial show across the spectrum with bickering, antagonism, etc. We have enough of this in real life, so we don't need to be reminded of racial tension in mock up stories. Rather give us positive stories about crime, whoever commit them, and have experienced policemen and women and detectives investigate such happenings without bothering to be political correct. I am now satisfied that this show is not meant for me.",/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2022,kenhdcgov1,9," Love it!
","It's my modern day, Hill Street Blues! I absolutely adore the show, the characters, the story line! In my humble opinion, it's all that a bag of chips and twelve Snapples to go! It has all the ingredients to be truly worthy of an Emmy Award. The show grabs you from the start and leaves you eagerly waiting for next week's segment. I actually think that if it's fleshed out, it could be great on the big screen as well! Everyone that I have spoken with that has seen the show has it on their must see list as well. It's on the list of my top cop shows, including Blue Bloods and Chicago P. D. in short, it's a qualified winner! Please see it and you will also become an ENY Addict as well!",/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv

28 November 2022,rick-09019-01805,10," great show
","I have noticed men that review titles dont seem to like a woman as a lead charecter and give bad reviews or below avarage
Get over your selfs and get used to it its a good script
Great acting and nothing ,like hill street blues .I dont see any resembalence to hill street blues .",/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,Advocate1,9," This show is pretty good!
","I normally don't go for the fake crime shows, but this one is good. The cast is great. Amanda Warren is a great lead. The writers are good because this show will give you some punchlines. Whether it's one cop saying you've mastered the art of the filibuster, a priest saying be careful cherry picking scripture, or another cop asking someone if they are still part of the veteran felons of America, this show will make you laugh.",/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2022,BertSletten,9," Great Potential
","Starts off good: good cast, interesting circumstances, a lot of options, East New York can go anywhere.",/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2022,Harry_Wild,2," The new Hill Street Blues in the making! Not!
","I like the characters but the location should be East Side New York City for me. Stories of the super rich is more to my liking. Not eastern section of the borough of Brooklyn. It more real especially in the upper ranks of the police department, where political influence is obeyed by those in high places! I only watched the 1st episode and a commander(Deputy Inspector)wanting to serve in the poor sections of the city is ridiculous in the 2022 era of NYC. There are way to many cop shows and movies showing the poor neighborhoods of Chicago, NYC already. The ranks above captain is a political influence/controlled by all the elected officials of the city, where the mayor is the head. The upper ranks in the police department are board line politicians to in many cases.",/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,sanjsrik,2," This is what NYC is like, just without really bad wooden acting
","The plot is good(ish). All the stereotype elements are there, all the plot characteristics are there, all the actors showed up on set, and then... everyone decided to ""act"" like they're on a crime show and ""act"".",/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2022,iambenee,1," If I could give this show a minus 1 I would
","Complete garbage. Too whimsical. Unrealistic. Not a good option. This is more of a Disney story. Not even filmed in ENY. Not even indicative of ENY. The writers did not try to capture the essence of ENY. Totally fail. To understand how bad this show is you have to understand that there is New York and then there is East new york. It is a Boro within itself. You do not venture there unless you live there or you know someone who lives there and even then you are taking your chances. It is not a neighborhood to be taken lightly. It is not called the beast for nothing. This could have been a great TV show however because of the lack of the writers to actually know what they're writing about it is, and again I say, a complete fail.",/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,newslogger44,5," Police Drama on steroids
","Clearly, the 43-minute time frame (between commercials) is simply not long enough to avoid cramming into one hour the hectic, rapid-fire editing and quirky, ""hip speed"" dialog (c'mon...do cops REALLY talk like that? Are they ALL so self-conscious?).",/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,UWSDiane,3," I really wanted to like it, but...
","...I can get over the rather wooden and spluttering acting by the lead. She sounds like she's reading her lines. I thought that with Jimmy Smits and Richard Kind and some of the other seasoned (and newbies) supporting cast that I could overlook it. Don't think I can. I will try the next episode to see if it gets better, but I think it might require some of the acting to improve. There are too many other shows with fantastic performances that I watch - this was 45 minutes (w/fast forwarding through ads) I'll never get back.",/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2022,howardbelcher,1," Horrible wokeness gone crazy

10 November 2022,baede-39749,4," Very sanitized version of the police
","Every case, every action, every step is aimed at showing all stand up police, no abuses, no rule breaking. Pillars of community. All good police guys playing by the rules against bad guys. Even something showing police abuse turns out to be just a twisted (lying) version of reality that for some reason random people on the street wanted to tell. Because none of those characters would commit any such abuse, none of them would do more than maaaybe bend the rules slightly to get someone who is guilty beyond the shadow of doubt and it's the only way to go. Interrogations are light, decent, 2 people talking, they'll even apologize for appearing aggressive. And more and more along these lines.",/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2022,bluecozmik,5," Seemed Kind of Wooden
","I wanted to like this show but it felt, like, off. Nothing felt real and the acting, IMHO, was soggy wood. I got no excitement watching as I did when I started watching Blue Bloods. That pilot episode had me and I've been watching since. One things, though...the theft of a baseball bat. It was hanging in a restaurant. You don't think anyone is going to notice that it's, like,... MISSING? That entire storyline makes no sense. Now unless it's part of a larger plot line, then ok. I'll give East New York another chance over the next couple of weeks, but after what I saw, I'm not holding my breath.",/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2022,alexthompson-52605,8," A good mix of detectives and uniforms
","You see alot of these police shows which only consentrate on the detectives and that's where East new york actually shows the growth and inner story of both the detectives and uniformed officers and it also makes you feel like your actually there and involved in everything that's going on, i also enjoy it because it has a mix of people from a new recruit to officers that have been on the force for a while.",/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,tsvetomir-38028,8," East New York Series Review
","For starters this tv show is amazing! I really love it, after watching two episodes I became a fan immediately and started to enjoy every second of episode after episode. I truly believe this series will blow up with fame and more seasons. I'm currently at episode 7 and all I can say is ""I want to see what happens next!"", season 1 at this point truly got my undivided attention and love. I think this series has a lot of potential and cannot wait to see a season two and three; hopefully more seasons after that.",/review/rw8689619/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2022,DoSiDoe,9," Pleasantly Surprised
