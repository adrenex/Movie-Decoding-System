30 March 2006,ccthemovieman-1,9," To Be Remembered Forever: 'Happy' And Bob Barker Trading Blows
","A ""pro"" golfer duking it out with veteran game-show host Bob Barker right in the middle of a tournament. That scene alone makes this one of the more memorable comedies of the last 30 years. Almost everyone I know has either seen or heard of that scene and everyone laughs at it.",/review/rw5476217/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2000,Quinoa1984,7," Apollo Creed with a wooden hand!! funny as hell
","Adam Sandler has a very funny movie here that works like no other since Caddyshack.  Sandler plays a lazy guy who has to save his grandmother's house from being removed.  So, he starts to play golf in a way that only Sandler can.  He is also instructed by Carl Weathers (who memorably played Apollo Creed in Rokcy), and wathcing his scenes I had to leave the theater from laughing so much (he had a wooden hand and it always gets knocked off). Sandler knows how to keep people rolling in the ailes, and this proves it. A++",/review/rw5476217/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2016,Floated2,8," Enjoyable Older Sandler film
","Happy Gilmore is an early film of Adam Sandler's during his 1990's era. The spirit of the film and the title character played by Sandler are every bit as enjoyable as many have considered this film to be. Happy is the ultimate chip-on-his-shoulder leading man, who settles every argument with a punch in the nose or a biting wisecrack. He has a short fuse which is shown that the slightest spark can set him off, occasionally with great results. He is a lifelong hockey fan, and he wants desperately to play with the pros, but he has one problem which is he can't skate. However after one day occasionally fooling around with golf with a few friends, he is noticed by former gold legend Chubbs. From there on, Chubbs tells him that Happy is a great and has talent, though Happy doesn't want any part of golf since his goal is to become a hockey player. Happy Gilmore does have several decent laughs and Adam Sandler plays the character as needed. For a comedy the plot works well enough and the pacing is good. It isn't too long and it is quite enjoyable for those of fans of this sort of comedy. As a rewatch 02/27/20' Happy Gilmore remains an enjoyable and fun positive watch.",/review/rw5476217/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2002,Anonymous_Maxine,8," Adam Sandler has never been a real favorite of the critics, but Happy Gilmore is undeniably one of his most successfully hilarious comedies.
","In Happy Gilmore, Sandler plays the part of a determined hockey player who doesn't make the team but soon inadvertently discovers that his hockey skills translate very nicely onto the golf green. Until the point in the film where Happy begins playing golf, most of the laughs come from his misfortune (`Happy Gilmore I called your name, didn't I?' [eagerly] `No, you didn't.' `Oh, well, better luck next year!!'), but it is the conflictive interaction between himself as a self-proclaimed hockey player and the much more formal and (for lack of a better word) high class game of golf that makes up the majority of the entertainment for the rest of the film.",/review/rw5476217/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2002,nucksfan4life,10," Turn off brain, watch movie, laugh, enjoy, laugh some more
","""Happy Gilmore"" is the Adam Sandler movie to see. If everyone had to see one Sandler movie before their lives were complete, I would seriously hope this is the movie they see. It's nice to see golf and hockey in a movie again. I don't think there is another movie out there that makes me laugh as much as ""Happy Gilmore"" does. You have Happy, the ultimate hero, fighting to win a life of security for his grandma. There's Shooter McGavin, the villain you love to hate, who attempts to foil Happy's quest. And then there's Mr. Larson, Happy's 8' tall monster of a former employer, threatening Shooter at every turn. Hey Bob Barker is in this movie! It doesn't get much funnier than Mr. Price Is Right insulting our hero. Well maybe Ben Stiller's part in this movie is funnier, as he corruptly directs a retirement home. It doesn't matter what's the funniest. This whole movie is one hilarious moment after another.",/review/rw5476217/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2015,thesar-2,7," Don't Look Now, I'm Finally Happy
","A follow-up to his miserable Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore is actually one of Adam Sandler's best comedies he's done. Maybe they got the right script, the correct director or just that Sandler dropped his loud, incoherent, obnoxious and incomprehensible gibberisha ton worked here and I found myself actually (and FINALLY) laughing out loud in one of his comedies.",/review/rw5476217/?ref_=tt_urv

","Recipe for a prime Adam Sandler comedy: dream up a ridiculous, one-note concept, plaster it with silly side gags, stretch the whole thing to fill ninety minutes and... somehow succeed in spite of yourself. There's no way this rudimentary formula should work so well, but here's Exhibit B, and I'm still laughing.",/review/rw5476217/?ref_=tt_urv

20 August 2020,briancham1994,9," Really funny
",This is one of Adam Sandler's best works. He has a totally zany and crude sense of humour that really pays off in this scenario. He totally invests in his role with an exaggerated gusto and this is what really makes the film hilarious.,/review/rw5476217/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2003,bob the moo,," Average comedy with energy and a few genuine laughs (but mostly goofball ones)
","Frustrated ice hockey player Happy Gilmore will never make it into the sport despite his intense hitting strength and aggressive game.  When he is seen by ex-golf pro Chubbs Peterson, on a driving range, Happy is offered the chance to enter a golf contest.  When his Grandma's house is repossessed, Happy enters in order to make money quickly.  However soon it becomes about more than money as pro Shooter McGavin tries to show him up.",/review/rw5476217/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2006,Flagrant-Baronessa,8," It's not Caddyshack, but it's quality comedy
","Happy Gilmore is Adam Sandler's only standout performance in a long list of half-assed, unfunny comedies. But this is it, the real deal. This is the film that all other Sandler films make references to, quote and celebrate, in case you ever wondered where phrases like ""It's all in the hips"" (as said in Little Nicky) and ""You eat pieces of sh*t for breakfast?"" (quoted everywhere) came from. Well, Happy Gilmore is the birth of these phrases as well as the birth of a comedic star. It is also just all-around solid comedic entertainment and a crash-course in golf. Or rather, 101 Things Not To Do On The Golf Course.",/review/rw5476217/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2008,Movie_Muse_Reviews,6," Easy-to-watch underdog sports comedy
","A temperamental aspiring hockey star with no talent finds he has a gift for the game of golf and uses it to make enough money to buy his grandmother's house back. This has light- hearted sports comedy written all over it. Toss in the comedy of Adam Sandler and then you go from light-hearted to wacko and borderline stupid. Either way, ""Happy Gilmore"" is about as easy to watch as rain drops on a window.",/review/rw5476217/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2006,gavin6942,7," Fast-Paced and Relaxing Sandler Film
","If you don't like Adam Sandler, you won't like this film. But that should be obvious.

","I decided to get into the older Adam Sandler movies because I did hear a lot about them. I also heard about how funny Happy Gilmore was, my mom had mentioned how she had it, so I decided to give it a chance. To my surprise, I had an excellent time watching this movie. I have to say that this is actually one of my favorite Adam Sandler movies.",/review/rw5476217/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2006,jaysilentbob37,7," A film that I treasure.
","This film is the one that introduced me to one of my favorite actors, Adam Sandler. His movies are mostly hit-or-miss gag machines, but this is one of his movies in which nearly every gag works. I almost miss the old Adam Sandler. The old Adam Sandler character would be a man who acts nice, but turns violent and angry when he doesn't get his way. Now he plays a mild-mannered every-man who makes little wisecracks. Not that the latter isn't funny, but the former is what he'll always be remembered for, and this is a perfect example of an Adam Sandler's true comedic side.",/review/rw5476217/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2006,GOWBTW,8," Barker vs. Gilmore: That's what made it great!
","This is one Adam Sandler movie that'll go down in the history books. He plays a ex-hockey player whose slap shot makes him a golf pro. I mean he's no Tiger Woods, but with a few lessons he'll be good. Happy Gilmore(Adam Sandler) would be playing pro-hockey, since he couldn't skate, his swing was the strong point of it all. I mean, if a person could swing, doesn't make him useless. Since Gilmore's skating handicapped him from the dream sport, golf club shaped like a hockey stick keeps him from being disillusioned. Chubbs Peterson(Carl Weathers, ""Action Jackson"", ""Predator"", and The ""Rocky"" Movies) is Happy's mentor. A football player-turned actor lost his hand to an alligator. Happy did get his revenge on the alligator, but his payback claims Chubbs' life as well. Then my favorite scene of all time is ""The Price is Right"" host Bob Barker battling Gilmore in a brawl, which I think is outstanding, and hilarious as well. This movie is what Barker calls is his ""revenge"" since he took karate lessons from Chuck Norris. WHAT A PAYOFF! That's one game-show host I wouldn't p--- off! All the way, this movie rocks. See it for yourself. Being a ""Price is Right"" fan, I wouldn't miss it for the world. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.",/review/rw5476217/?ref_=tt_urv

","Back in the 1990's there was a time when Adam Sandler was one of the leading funny men. The two standout films that starred Adam Sandler at the time was ""Billy Madison"" and this one here ""Happy Gilmore"".was the metaphoric jumper cable that electrified Mr. Sandler's acting career.

","Golf is dreadfully boring. Thankfully, films like Caddyshack and Happy Gilmore posses ambition to bring fun to the green. Both are fresh ideas that use their actors to motivate their screenplay. Unfortunately, Happy Gilmore manages to drive itself into the high grass area shortly when the game commences. Let's watch...",/review/rw5476217/?ref_=tt_urv
