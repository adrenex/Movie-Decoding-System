","This is not your put it on and do some cleaning around the house series. If you're not paying attention, well, you will be lost. I was meandering a bit and I actually did pay attention - I rewound a bit here and there.",/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2022,Hallelujah289,8," If Dr Who went darker
","""The Devil's Hour"" is a binge-worthy Amazon Prime streaming series that is almost like an exercise in thought: what if the 12th Doctor Who, played by Peter Capaldi as well, did not have the moral not to kill? What if he did not have the same capabilities, but the same motive to stop chaos?",/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,rosemaryandthyme,10," Stay for the ending as it all makes sense, great story
","WOW just finished this and can't stop thinking about it. It's a LONG time since a series has had this effect on me. A fantastic story and everything ties up in the end (as much as fiction can). Acting is exceptional, especially from Peter C and the child who plays Isaac. Be aware that the first few episodes won't make much sense, they keep moving time frames, certain characters come and go, situations change drastically and so on. Another reviewer has suggested to watch intently and not to scroll lazily at your phone. I concur, you really have to watch and take notice so as not to get confused and also to enjoy the wrap up in the last episode when it all falls sadly into place. I really loathed one character and can't say who without spoiling it but I'm sure you will know who I mean when you watch. I feel this series deserves a second viewing which I plan to do. Congratulations to all involved and especially to the writer/s for thinking outside the box.",/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2022,mbell-56214,8," Interesting, clever, and entertaining
","Peter Capaldi makes for a very creepy sinister character indeed, as does the boy with no emotions.",/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,Erik_Surewaard,8," The real gem is the last episode, which itself easily deserves 10 stars!
","You are going to have to watch the first five episodes - which I each rate with a decent 7/10 - to be able to watch the real gem: i.e. The sixth episode. That sixth episode is just so extremely awesome, that it alone deserves a 10/10.",/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,herecomesjuan,9," Absolutely Top Notch
","Some reviewers on here wouldn't know a good series if it slapped them on the face! This is a quality thriller all the way through that keeps you guessing and wraps it up with a decent ending. People say you have to pay close attention, surely if you are putting on a series or a film while doing the hoover or got your head stuck on Social Media on your phone then it's not worth watching, is complete trash and requires the attention span of a 3 year old.",/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,apixielife,9," A delightful Surprise

6 November 2022,kkmgirl-448-111988,9," Finally!
","Finally something GOOD on TV! Fascinating, mind-bending and clever plot (perfect for sci-fi nerds like me), excellent pacing and cinematography, great acting, and just a much-needed wild ride after slogging through countless drivel (couldn't finish Inside Man for that reason). Thank you and pleeeaaasee bring us more! I was sad it ended so quickly, but appreciate the beauty of brevity and not beating a dead horse like so many bloated series being made now. I'm hoping the network bigwigs take note that viewers are generally intelligent and require quality entertainment a little more often than what's being fed to us. On that note, bring back OA!!",/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,Headturner11,7," And a half
","Which is high for me. I should of gave it an 8 considering what's been being released lately! Finally the UK may be getting back to their roots of making some of the best crime/thriller shows! This one is well done, all of the acting is good etc. I didn't love it tho. Like I'm not sitting here thinking about parts today or any one character( that usually happens tho rarely when I love something) but never the less it was good! Kind of similar to Shinning girls but better. I really liked Alex Ferns and I like Peter Capaldi in most everything he does. I just wished we had learned more abut the boy and the ending wasn't the greatest but it was a good series to spend the evening on and a good creepy Halloween watch as well!",/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2022,demaym,9," What an ending
",The last episode is one of the best finales to a mini series I have ever seen. It's commonplace for writers to flake out these days and use the old 'interpret it yourself' ending as a guise for not knowing how to end their story properly - that's certainly not the case here.,/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2022,mazbutt-16041,9," Very well made, tense thriller. Pay attention!

7 November 2022,ar_brierley,9," Intriguing!! Pay close attention
","If you're looking for comparisons, this is kind of like themes/ideas from The Matrix, Interstellar, Sliding Doors, Inception, etc., so if you liked that type of film you'll probably enjoy this (I certainly did!).",/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,rob225uk,9," Binged this in 2 days, couldn't stop watching
","I echo what others have said, episodes 1-5 are great, Ep 6 is insanely good and very different. Cipaldi plays his part so well that you genuinely want to see more of him/character beyond this series. In a weird way he's almost like a morally shady ""superhero""with the things he is able to do.",/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,Otte1,8," Finally! Something to rank high!
","Wow! This is movie-making! I am a person who generally rate majority of movies from 3-5 stars, and only a few gets 6 and only about twice a year do I assign a 7 star(last was Terminal List).",/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,Ronnie_mcdowell,9," Gripping, brilliant and worth a watch
","Loved every bit of it. See some keek reviews but omg what a series. Full of suspense, guesswork and some great acting. Issac is fantastic. For a child of that age to be so good is brilliant. Nikesh Patel (Ravi) plays the roll unbelievably well and Peter Capaldi just speaks for himself. I was so engrossed through he whole series. Guessing and thinking. It has to be one of the best series I've seen on Amazon Prime in a long time. If anyone actually has bad to say they need to open their mind and get engrossed. Glad I watched it and it shows that there are still great shows out there being made. Especially British shows. A* for me.",/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,folk_egm,9," The devil's moment hits 3.33 minutes full of surprises beyond expectation!
",A series where the plot seems nothing. It turns out to be like a typical western ghost movie. But it turns out this is a series that has a very different approach than most of the previous ones. Call it a fresh idea that has come up. And used with the original plot that is like a ghostly ghost to tear ambitions beyond that many unexpectedly. But still the emotion of frightening and frightening is good. It's like a combination of a famous director. Mike Flanagan + M Night Shmalayan + Nolan came together and made it perfect in their own way. From the work of the first new creator too Until I feel that I have to give it to the most surprising series of this year. And I really don't want anyone to miss it.,/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2022,gridoon2023,6," Five episodes of stalling, teasing and padding before a riveting finale
","Of course it is a common practice for TV series to pad their storytelling in order to reach the required episode quota on the schedule, but rarely have I seen a series doing it more blatantly than ""The Devil's Hour"": Peter Capaldi's character on many occasions literally stops just short of saying ""I know exactly what is going on, but I can't tell you yet; you'll have to wait until we get to episode 6"". And then there is the insufferable genius-silent-special kid (one of the worst cliches of the horror-fantasy genre), who of course could explain a lot if he talked but of course he won't talk because then he would explain a lot and the series would be over. Oh, there is also the schizophrenic old grandmother; she also knows ""more than she's telling"". After five episodes of shameless padding and stalling, fake scares, subliminal images and fights with drug dealers, the series does arrive at a riveting finale; nothing you haven't seen before, but certainly very well-done (though, be warned, it still leaves a lot of questions unanswered). THIS should in fact have been the beginning, not the ending of the show: they should have laid the premise on the table from the start and gone off from there. One of the strongest points is definitely the acting: Jessica Raine, with her always interesting, unconventionally beautiful face is superlative, Capaldi (obviously a veteran of sci-fi hijinks) is commanding, Nikesh Patel offers solid support. As for Isaac....let's just say I'm happy he is not cold anymore. **1/2 out of 4.",/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,TheOther_,9," Extraordinary
","Finally another Amazon highlight that forces you to binge the miniseries! The Devils Hour shows how important a selected ensemble is. Not only Jessica Raine and Oscar winner Peter Capaldi shine in the nerve-wracking 6 episodes. Every role, no matter how small, is extraordinarily well cast.",/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,benaggie,9," Absorbing mind bender
","I was expecting a halfway decent horror series, with maybe some psychological drama thrown in, but what I got instead was a near perfect blend of crime drama, horror, thriller, and science-fiction. To have the guts to try and blend all of these genres together and end up not giving too much time or too little of one or another was impressive. Seamlessly blended.",/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,eve_dolluk,8," The devil is in the detail

29 October 2022,wolflorien-81162,10," Excellent
","This great series reminded me of when I first saw 'Life on Mars'. It has the character engagement and slow burn of those great stories. Benjamin Chivers, as the young boy is phenomenal, a great little actor.",/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2022,naomimuldrew27,9," Mind bending TV
","Fantastic TV show. I honestly thought my brain was going to melt at some points lol but it was all worth it in the end. Peter Capaldi really is an amazing actor and very underrated. The casting in general was very good and the actors all worked well together. I genuinely cared about them. Mike was a complete POS, I absolutely hated him, so good job done by Phil Dunster lol. The whole show was just something very different, a bit reminiscent of Life on Mars, which is one of my favourite and IMO, one of the best TV programmes ever made. So many different interwoven storylines but told in a way that made sense. Really good TV!",/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2022,esjacobs,10," Clever, dept, high level of suspense but not in the way you expect
","Wow! Recently finished this and I was very impressed, especially with the ending. I saw a short clip on social media and was intrigued so gave it a shot. Was sucked in from the first episode in and as said, such high level of suspense. I do agree with other reviews saying to watch this with focus and attention, but that's not hard as it is a very compelling story. It has a unique side to it, so don't expect a traditional drama/thriller mystery. It has some sci fi but that sounds to scientific for what it actually is. It is SO DEEP, so I think it really suits for people who like to reflect on life, spirituality etc. It makes you think, while you are watching it and I love it when a series does that. If you are looking for entertainment alone, this is not for you. It kept me guessing till the end and was blown away with the ending, so clever! The less you know, the better with this one. So smart and unique, a gem.",/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2022,BijeshNagesh,8," Be Patient, It Gets Spooky
","First off, let me state there was no devil or demon in this show. It took me on a mystery all its own without any supernatural padding. This British mystery-thriller demanded my patience, but it was well worth it in the end.",/review/rw8656234/?ref_=tt_urv
