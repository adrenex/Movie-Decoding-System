27 November 2021,UniqueParticle,8," Kinda brilliant despite cheesiness
",I love the way this movie accelerates everything with Issac and the horror that trembles along with him! A House on the Bayou has some reality drama acting that was definitely the downfall otherwise the movie is dope. For a huge horror fanatic this was just right if you don't take it to seriously.,/review/rw8129515/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2021,johnnyhbtvs27,6," Blumhouse again
",I actually really enjoyed this. It has it's cheesy moments and some ridiculous overacting but it has a charm to it. The plot twists may get a bit out of hand but Jacob Lofland (who should be in a Children Of The Corn movie) is menacing enough to keep things ticking over. One of Blumhouses better recent efforts.,/review/rw8129515/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2022,Wikkid_Gamez,6," Well, that was weird...
","Not necessarily in a bad way, a very odd movie, but kept my attention easily to the end. I liked it. This is probably the shortest review I have ever left... I found it worth a watch.",/review/rw8129515/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,mycannonball,6," Good enough
","A classic supernatural horror film where a couple and their child are trapped in a house with a couple psychos. This is different than a home invasion story though, because it's more of a reluctant dinner party that goes bad and there are a couple good twists. There are also a few nonsensical moments and the epilogue is overly long, but overall, it's good enough to finish.",/review/rw8129515/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2021,midnitepantera,7," Eerie and Unsettling Gothic Thriller ;D
","Interesting little horror thriller, about the BAD things people do to each other. I found Isaac very unnerving and a bit charming at the same time. This feels like an old school style horror movie, like Burnt Offerings or The Other (both 70's gothic horror)
I found it overall kinda satisfying except for Toby?? :( That bothers me ALOT.",/review/rw8129515/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2022,drjacobgrayson,7," Fun mystery horror
",Try this movie if you're sick of watching the same old slasher horror movies. This movie has a good storyline and a lot of twists that I didn't see coming.,/review/rw8129515/?ref_=tt_urv

27 November 2021,jamericanbeauty,8," If You Hated Hemlock Grove and It Follows, You Will Hate This Too.
","I happened to love Hemlock Grove's Season One and I loved and still love It Follows. A House on the Bayou is my favorite kind of horror. Like Hemlock Grove and It Follows, it's mostly unpredictable, it's strange, initially situations seem to escalate out of nowhere but they do go somewhere, there's a dark enigmatic character (Jacob Lofland) and there's a moral lesson at the core of the story. The dialogue is weird at times (Every time someone said Grandpappy, I laughed out loud because it's not 1930 and ridiculous Hollywood writers are so out of touch with the South. No one talks like that in the 21st Century). You don't know what the hell is going on most of the time because just when you think the script is going left, it goes right. And I loved the unsettling tone. I loved the cast. Jacob Lofland's Issac was my favorite. I couldn't stand the daughter. The moralistic message, script, acting, score, tone and direction complemented each other. There's never a dull moment and the runtime flew by. I enjoyed getting lost in this movie's strange Louisiana country mansion and its equally eerie parish.",/review/rw8129515/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2022,janmanuel2,9," I can't believe the low reviews ...
","This thriller is totally different than any I have seen, so I disagree with anyone who says it's mundane. A large portion of viewers aren't happy unless there is constant action or zombies. The suspense was intense. It frightened me. The acting was great and the twists were too. I gave it an extra star because the low reviews were not fair. If you want action look up action thrillers. I recommend. A change of pace from the same old same old.",/review/rw8129515/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2021,whytetigress,7," Fun to watch even if it was odd
","I love a good/bad horror movie and this was that. I had some moments where I genuinely wondered WTF was going on, but all and all, I had fun watching it and I'd absolutely watch a sequel. Was it great? No. Were there some really odd moments? Absolutely. But it was absolutely worth the watch on whatever channel I randomly DVRed it from.",/review/rw8129515/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2021,resistancefitness,8," Do not believe the negative reviews
",Excellent original idea which quite frankly is the best movie I've seen this year. Forget about peel and his movies just watch this. What do people want from a movie nowadays? Probably want the main characters diverse and passive aggressive but unfortunately that is a turn off for us seasoned hardcore movie fans.,/review/rw8129515/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2022,ubasarsahin,7," Thanks Blumhouse
","Well this came as a surprise, I don't know how it got into my watchlist but I gave it a chance today. I don't regret it. That was some cinematography and soundtrack. Loved the story too. I was interested all the way through.",/review/rw8129515/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2022,jmbovan-47-160173,7," Cajun Morality tale
","So, a decent twisting plot helps a somewhat standard movie. An extra star or two for the overall impact and philosophical aspects developed in the film as well as the restraint used by the filmmakers to keep graphic elements to a minimal. It still packs tension in the film but without the use of excessive force. Some elements are a bit contrived, ans that does lessen the impact of the film. But still a decent watch.",/review/rw8129515/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2021,gab-67599,6," Well...
","I have definitely seen better movies out of Blum but this felt more like a drama than a horror movie. It was like no one could decided which direction to go in, horror or drama? The little girl was a horrible actress and everyone else just did the bare min. Although I do not recommend watching because it will bore you, I would say it was ok for just a one time watch. It was at least half good so 5 and I was nice so I added one to that.",/review/rw8129515/?ref_=tt_urv

19 November 2021,Draysan-Jennings,4," Terrible
",This has to be one of the top 5 worst Blumhouse films out there. It started out ok but about 20 minutes in it becomes another Blumhouse epic fail. I don't know why I keep watching their films. Other then the recent Halloween movies everything they've put out in the last several years has been garbage. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.,/review/rw8129515/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2022,scottkolflat,2," Ugh.
","The whole time I was watching this movie I felt like I was watching a trainwreck. I couldn't look away. It just got worse and worse and worse until it finally ended. I'm not even sure what the point of the story was, but I'm pretty sure whoever wrote this really really really hates whoever cheated on them. Next time instead of making a movie, maybe seek some therapy instead of putting everyone else through this trash.",/review/rw8129515/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2021,paul_haakonsen,3," Mundane and forgettable mystery thriller...
","Granted, when I sat down to watch the 2021 mystery thriller ""A House on the Bayou"" from writer and director Alex McAulay, I hadn't even heard about the movie. So I had no idea what I was in for. But the synopsis for the movie sounded interesting enough, and it being a movie that I hadn't already seen also made me give the movie a chance.",/review/rw8129515/?ref_=tt_urv

18 February 2022,apryla-58795,3," This uh makeuh no sense
","Ok this had potential to be good but they kind of lost me when they expected us to believe that an old milquetoast like the husband would be with a wife as young and good looking as her. She didn't look old enough to have a daughter as old as she did. So it started off bad but then when I saw Isaac introduced (and heard a banjo strumming somewhere in the distance) and I was like ok this bout to be some backwoods weird ish but then it turned into a murder for hire plot which was a stretch. How'd he set all that up in such a short amount of time?! Then it turned supernatural...really bad CGI which really took me out of the film and then I was really done but I had come so far I had to finish it just to see if it ever came back around and made sense...it shore did not. I thought there would be a twist at the end but not the one we got. I thought it was gonna turn out to be the wife who somehow was related to Isaac and Grandpappy and she was the one who lured the girlfriend to the house to kill her but nope Isaac comes back and then we think he's just a crazy person and he gets killed. Wrong again! Then the sheriff drives the wife all the way out there...for what? She tells her on the way back what was going on so why'd they have to waste time driving all that way?! Soooo convoluted! It's like the writers tried to throw everything they could into this but it ended up backfiring. What I still can't make sense of is how the wife got the listing for the house in the first place if the owners were from ""beyond"". How'd she get lured to that house if it didn't really exist? It just exists until the town decides it doesn't need to exist any more? So weird.",/review/rw8129515/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2021,kremicoco,1," Scratching my head!
","I have no idea what I spent 88 mins watching but this was the most disjointed movie I've seen in a long time. There was no horror, it felt like there were so many different themes and none of them aligned. I'm not even sure what we were supposed to take from this. Husband cheats on wife, wife decides not to divorce him but to go on family vacation in the Bayou. They meet Isaac and grandpappy, they have a contentious conversation over him lying about veal. Isaac & grandpappy show up to cook them veal, and from there it mess of a show becomes a hot trashy mess.",/review/rw8129515/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2022,avocadosrbad,3," Awful acting
","The wifes character was such a jerk. I liked the actress in WestWorld, her acting was terrible in this. So, you're pissed at your husband for having an affair so you endanger them with weirdos, out of spite? Your child hates veal and your husband hates veal, so naturally you want to force them to eat veal at some weirdos house. They write a crazy message on the receipts and you're like its cool, Im going to go your house. Oh and you rent someones house and try to break into a room thats locked. What kind of woman is she? Shes weird too. They come over and the ""grandpappy"" is rude, I would have kicked him out. Just dumb and awkward any normal person would have kicked them out by now.",/review/rw8129515/?ref_=tt_urv
