29 January 2011,Matt_Layden,5," I expected it to be more fun.
","A movie about a killer tire sounds like the most ridiculous concept next to someone creating a human centipede. Yet, these two concepts did in fact make it onto film and both of them failed to meet their absurdly high expectations. The film is a homage to 'no reason', as we are told at the beginning and when a film is created for no reason, you know you are in trouble. ",/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2011,jd7myers-1,10," Deep Tread Indeed in this Particular Tire
","It was a rainy Sunday and I went looking for cheese, but found a savory meal. Frankly, I was hoping to kill off a few brain cells in the mindless fun of watching a movie about a killer tire. Expecting something along the lines of Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, I wanted to drown myself in delicious B-movie goodness. This coming from the man that cannot change the channel when my remote calls up images of Joan Collins being eaten by giant ants in Empire of the Ants.",/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2011,Coventry,5," I am Rubber, you are Glue. I'll blow up your head and roll over it, too!
","Which two words would you, and hopefully any other reasonable human being, use to describe a movie with a plot synopsis like this: an ordinary rubber tire comes to life in the middle of the Californian desert, quickly discovers that he disposes of dangerous telepathic powers and goes on a murderous stroll. The tire violently blows up people's heads left, right and center while a cinematic audience follows his joyful escapades from a safe distance through binoculars. Well, most likely but completely justified you will use the words ""absurd"" and ""random"". The most clever gimmick about this film, however, is that it actually points out the randomness before you even have the opportunity to ponder about it. ""Rubber"" opens with an extended spoken monologue by one of the characters and he repeatedly emphasizes the fact that everything in this film happens for absolutely no reason at all. Even more so, ""Rubber"" is an hour and a half long homage to randomness. Robert the tire comes to life for no reason. He can make small animals and human heads explode for no reason. He chases a cute brunette girl around for no reason. A group of bizarre people observe him like it's a real life movie for no reason. You get the picture. ",/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2011,KineticSeoul,," The fact that the movie has no reason is alright, but it just didn't have enough to keep me entertained
","Just because a movie has a low budget and is unique doesn't make it a good movie. My favorite part about this movie is basically the intro since it sort of pumps you up, it seemed like a excuse later on for the movie for not making any sense. Not only does the movie not make any sense the characters are very awkward, but that is what somewhat makes this movie interesting since the characters aren't super serious. The plot is basically about a serial killer tire that goes around blowing stuff and people up using psychokinetic powers. the awkwardness of the situations is what make this movie remotely intriguing. Also trying to figure out exactly what is going on is what drives this movie as well. I don't know if some scenes were intended to be funny, but it was sort of humorous at times which is a plus. The flaw is that the movie just wasn't all that fun to watch and was repetitive with lot of the time taking up with a tire rolling around. Just because it has a unique idea that hasn't really been done before just doesn't make a movie good sometimes and that applies to this movie. I was expecting at least a crazy final scene but that didn't really happen either.",/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2012,MBunge,2," Quentin Dupeiux...you're no Charlie Kaufman.
","I never thought I would type these words, but I have a new appreciation for Synecdoche, New York. Yes, that film is an uber-pretentious piece of masturbatory tripe that crawls so far up its own ass it disappears into a parallel universe. But at least it tries hard and puts a lot of brain power into its willful oddity. Rubber is like Synecdoche, New York's lazy, mentally challenged half-cousin. It's just as pretentious and masturbatory but doesn't have the energy or intelligence to scratch its own ass, let alone venture up in there. Here's what I actually thought while watching this movie.",/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2011,Radu_A,5," too much in love with itself to be original
",Sigh... I've been really looking forward for this one. And the premise makes 'Rubber' sound almost irresistible. But there are two ways of killing off a smart movie idea: 1.) Believe that the idea works so well with the audience that it won't notice inconsistencies and bad acting. 2.) Constantly remind the audience what a smart idea it is watching.,/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2011,BA_Harrison,5," Not as gripping as I had hoped.
","As is explained at the very beginning of Rubber by a cop who inexplicably climbs out of a car trunk, this film is an homage to 'no reason', the idea that, if the writer or director so desires, anything can happen in a movie for absolutely no reason. Once this concept has been established, Rubber is virtually impossible to fault as far as plot or logic are concerned: whenever the film raises an awkward question—such as 'How can a tyre can just get up and kill by the power of telekinesis' or 'Why is an audience watching proceedings from a nearby hill-top through binoculars'—the answer will always be 'no reason'.",/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2018,Stevieboy666,1," Tyresome crap
","Film within a film about a rubber tyre that somehow comes to life in the desert, gains the ability to make objects explode and goes on a killing rampage. Yeap, credit for originality. Just a shame that they made such a lousy job of it. Its meant to be an offbeat comedy but not once did I laugh at the sheer stupidity of it. Just wanted the end credits to roll (get it?). Several head explosions (Scanners) but that's it.",/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2011,kosmasp,8," Without reason
","If a movie tells you from the get-go that there is no reason, that there is no purpose in anything, does that leave any ground for critics? Of course it does! Even if it tells you (or because it tells you), that there is no bigger plan behind it, I knew when I watched it, that this will offend and disturb a lot of people. As you can see by the overall voting, most people didn't like it.",/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2010,nixskits,8," DEFINITELY not a film for everyone!
","After seeing this peculiar, but compelling little picture, I really wonder more than before what the motives are that any of us have for making a pilgrimage to a theatre to watch a film! I found Rubber to be downright hilarious at times and very disturbing at others. Quentin Dupieux's oddball spectacle was 1 of the early sellouts at this past Fantasia festival and hearing so many people talking about the story's development made me want to check out the weirdness now that smaller venues are booking the flick for exhibition. This will alienate as many, if not many more, as it charms.",/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2011,Da-Ant,8," A horror film about technique and style
","""The film you are about to see is an homage to 'no reason', that most powerful element of style.""

9 February 2016,Leofwine_draca,3," Deeply unfunny
","RUBBER is a film that wants to be hip and cool so badly that it physically hurts. It's a high concept - so high it belongs in outer space - comedy horror about a sentient tyre that goes around killing people and things. That's it. There's no attempt to rationalise or explain the events on screen, it's just one death after another, with lots of wraparound stuff to pad out the running time.",/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2017,Style_is_Substance,8," Comedic and Clever
","What can really be said about Rubber? Those calling this film ironically good, so bad it's good, or a B-movie, are completely mistaken. While very different films, Rubber is to the 2010's what Monty Python and the Holy Grail is to the 1970's. Part of the humor is found within Rubber is through self-aware meta jokes designed to troll the audience while making both subtle and obvious commentary on both cinema and the audience -- that is both the average moviegoers and those who criticize them, both appealing and criticizing the sensibilities of western society in the 21st century.",/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2011,white_fire4,1," Doesn't deserve all the talk/hype about it
","Much like anyone else who has seen this, or plans to see it, I was lured in by the trailers, in particular the ""funny"" one, which makes it seems like a seriously campy B movie, about a homicidal tire that goes around and blows things up, for apparently no reason other than it can.",/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2014,TheMarwood,2," Awe, look how self aware and clever this thinks it is
","I have nothing against tires, or killer tires for that matter, especially tires with decent taste in women and the ability to make people's heads explode. In what could have been an enjoyable B movie, is instead an obnoxious self aware mash up of a B movie and an experimental art film. This aggressively meta exercise fails on both counts and just feels smugly content with how clever it's trying to be. The theatricality of the fourth wall being broken to have this gibberish thrown at us, is an embarrassment of amateur filmmaking. Rubber is an indulgent laugh free oddity that just plays on screen for itself, it doesn't engage on any level and if Quentin Dupieux had any mercy on audiences, he would have made this a short film, not a feature. It's a misguided idea stretched beyond tedium.",/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2011,DonFishies,6," I wanted to love it, but instead remain baffled by this wildly unique experiment
","How does one succinctly describe Rubber to another person, without sounding like a lunatic? Is it even possible to try and theorize, or try and explain the story of an inanimate tire named Robert, who has the simultaneous abilities of being able to move on its own and use telekinetic powers to destroy anything and anyone that comes in its way? I am beginning to think I sound a little off just as I write this, but baffled expressions and thoughts aside, Rubber is one of the most original and unique films anyone is bound to see. But there is a price for being so exceptionally different than other films.",/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2011,scott_thompson7454,2," Novel concept, terrible execution
","I wanted to like this movie. I really did. It is, after all, about a killer tire called Robert who discovers he has destructive telepathic powers and so goes on a killing rampage. What's not to like there? Unfortunately, the director is the most pretentious man on the planet and overloads the film with postmodern flourishes that don't work and serve merely to remind you of the far superior directors he is ripping off - e.g. David Lynch and Tobe Hooper. What could have been a fun low budget horror comedy ends up a tedious mish mash of genres and ideas. For instance, the audience is a part of the film, represented by a group of people watching the events unfold and commenting upon them. An interesting idea but the director doesn't know where to go with it and it ends up sidetracking the film. Rubber should have been fun but it's far from that - slow, not remotely amusing or nearly as clever as it thinks it is, badly acted and written, bog standard direction. When the best thing in your movie is Wings Hauser, you know you're in trouble. To (sort of) quote Homer Simpson, this movie was more boring than church.",/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv

","Everything about this movie said it was going to be a delightfully trashy b-rated flick; a kitschy trip down the horror-comedy path starring a sentient, super-powered tire. Unfortunately, though, the heart of the film is lost within the folds of its uninspired meta-plagued script, indie-inspired filmography, and dry absurd jokes.",/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2011,iwantyourjob,1," Brilliant!
","This movie is not for everyone. I understand some people will watch this Hitchcockian masterpiece, and walk away perplexed. As is the case with any work of art. This film will take you on a journey through an unimaginable, inexplicable, but fantastic life of a tire that goes by the name of Robert. This film is a tribute to classics like ... like ...I don't know, I was just joking anyway. This movie is TERRIBLE. If you could say it's about anything, it's about an ""ANIMATE"" tire, not an inanimate one as is described in the summary, but no reason to be a douche about it. It shakes, and rattles, and makes things blow up. And on top of that there's nothing on top of that. Personally, I can watch anything. I make watching bad movies my biznass. So I know bad movies. This movie falls into the category of, ""Directors who want to see how long it will take before you walk out the theater in disgust."" I need to work on my category titles but you get the idea.",/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2019,TheMovieDiorama,4," Rubber wears its ridiculous premise thin with questionably pretentious direction.
","This should've been bonkers. This should've been bizarre entertainment. This should've been the epitome of b-movie homages with plenty of schlocky gore and hilarious acting. Alas, it wasn't. I face the long narrow road, wandering the dusty concrete alone, as I venture to my destination. Disappointment. To say Rubber's potential for refreshing originality is endless, would be an understatement. Yet Dupieux offers an ostentatious philosophy that seemingly burns the rubber off of this sentient tyre. Speaking of conscious wheels, we and a group of spectators follow a living tyre (named Robert apparently...) who seemingly crushes everything until he discovers psychokinetic powers that bestow explosive results.",/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2012,mat-mcnaughton-254-33257,1," Ugh, no.
","How many times can you be meta in one movie? Whatever your answer is, you'll still have less than Rubber. The whole point of satire is to use irony to mock people, but nobody bothered to explain that to the director. Being ironic for the sake of itself is only acceptable for hipsters, and therefore this is as hipster as a movie can get. Honestly everything about it just screams, ""Don't you wish you had thought of this first?"" while denying that fact that nobody did.",/review/rw2656632/?ref_=tt_urv
