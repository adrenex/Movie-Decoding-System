1 October 2021,cricketbat,4," This sequel is a loud and frantic mess
","Much like the protagonist in Venom: Let There Be Carnage, I feel like there were two different screenwriters battling about what this movie should be, and they didn't really communicate with each other. This sequel is a loud and frantic mess, where superpowers can do whatever the plot demands, characters don't care about consistency, and the same jokes are repeated a dozen times. If you liked the first Venom movie, you'll probably like this one. I didn't, so I don't.",/review/rw7421764/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2021,Tweetienator,4," The Art of Genetic Movie Engineering
","Marvel and DC these days remind me of those big players of the worldwide cheeseburger ""distribution network"" - the products always taste the same, because the ingredients are always accurately of the same nature and made the same way. Always. The same applies these days to those entertainment companies - you already know what to expect if a new show or movie leaves the factories of those big players of genetic movie engineering. Venom: Let There Be Carnage is not a candidate for the worst movie categories nor a total bore or fail, it is just a part of that endless and constant stream of ""entertainment"" these factories produce: easy to consume, easy to forget. Long gone are the times when I heard people talking about a new movie or show of those ""big"" players. Disappointed? No, it's just business as usual.",/review/rw7421764/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2021,Pjtaylor-96-138044,3," Not even a turd in the wind; it's just nothing.
","At least 'Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021)' is brief. That's pretty much the only praise I can send its way. I mean, it's genuinely terrible. Frankly, it's almost unfathomable how a team as talented as this can turn out something so amateurish. It honestly feels unfinished. Having said that, it's actually difficult to properly review, because it's just... well, nothing. It's not even boring. It's totally empty, a meal comprised of zero calories. It's also insanely forgettable. If you asked me to recount its plot beat for beat, even while the credits were still rolling, I'd seriously struggle to come up with a coherent answer. As I said, it's difficult to properly review. Perhaps that's because reflecting on it is like trying to remember a bad dream; by the time you try to articulate it, it has already slipped from your mind. Perhaps it's because it leaves you feeling totally apathetic, unequipped to even think about its events, never mind its shortcomings. Perhaps it's because the flick is genuinely less boring than many movies deserving of a similar, or even marginally better, rating, but also genuinely worse than most of those same movies. A bad movie is better than a boring one, I suppose, but a movie that leaves you feeling nothing, not even annoyance, is surely the bottom of the barrel. It goes in one ear and straight out of the other. It's awful, but I can't bring myself to get worked up about it. I'm aware that I haven't even begun to delve into its cavalcade of issues, but I just can't bring myself to do so. That in itself says a lot. I'm totally ambivalent about the piece. It isn't fun, but it isn't boring; it isn't competent, but it isn't offensive; it isn't anything, but it isn't... well, anything. In the end, it will leave you feeling like Venom himself: hungry for something with a brain. Heck, even a bar of chocolate would be more fulfilling. 3/10.",/review/rw7421764/?ref_=tt_urv

1 October 2021,guskeller,5," A big pile of nothing
","Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a one trick pony that doesn't land its trick. The entire movie is filler stalling for its final battle, yet that showdown is disappointing. Yes, it is between two marketable comic book characters, but that's all it provides. The villain is underdeveloped and uninteresting, the imagery is sloppy and cluttered, and the choreography is nonsensical. Because there is no coherent style or vision, the sequence ends up being a big, ugly mess. Normally, the details of an action sequence wouldn't be so significant, but that's all this film invests in.",/review/rw7421764/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2021,DongDiggity,4," Carnage... More like Friendship
","Seriously, you call your sequel let their be Carnage yet make it pg13 which limits everything! Carnage has always been about violence and to a certain degree as is venom. It's bad enough they made venom ""good"" they sterilized carnage as well! I had such high hopes for this but was left saying what the F!",/review/rw7421764/?ref_=tt_urv

",I've seen both Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson act their behinds off and it was great. I've seen humor and dark humor work wonders for DC. I've seen Michelle Williams look beautiful and amazingly desirable. None of these feature in Venom: Let There Be Carnage.,/review/rw7421764/?ref_=tt_urv

27 November 2021,ashfordofficial,1," Venom: Let There Be Cringe
","One of the most disappointing films of this year. A mind-numbingly tiresome entry in Sony's Spider-Man Universe. I can't figure out what is happening in this dumb-but-not-good-dumb sequel for a much superior predecessor. The big mistake they made was the shortening of the runtime to just 97 minutes, resulting in a jumbled mess of editing scrape.",/review/rw7421764/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2021,drpainters,6," Not as good as first but similar
",It's not as good as the first but has some cool scenes and interactions of characters. Should of been like 15-20mind longer to fill in stuff at the start that just feels missed or cut short. How Harrelson becomes carnage I found stupid but rest of it I was fine with. Enjoyable sequel and looked forward to the next one.,/review/rw7421764/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2022,patrickdtanswell,1," Awful, borderline unbearable
","I just needed it put in words how much I hate this movie. I hate the script and how much it emphasizes telling over showing, I hate the cheesy phoned in acting that doesn't trust the audience to understand what emotion someone is feeling unless they're screaming or crying, I hate the tacky attempts at humor that fall flat, then get up and proceed to bludgeon you with punchline after punchline like a high school bully beating you with your own fist and shouting ""Stop hitting yourself!"". No level of superhero action is worth this level of cringe dialogue, no amount of love I have for Venom and Carnage is worth subjecting me to this torture, but hey at the end of the day I can take solace in the fact that these depictions have absolutely nothing to do with the malevolent entities of Marvel comics fame and are in fact, failed facsimiles harping on the success of the MCU for their characterization.",/review/rw7421764/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you had issues with the first one and the (low) level of violence it had (PG13 and all that), do not expect this to be any better. This also is PG13. Since I am not too aware of Venom as he was depicted in the comics, I was free of that and quite enjoyed the first one.",/review/rw7421764/?ref_=tt_urv

","... but as a piece of stand-up comedy it manages to assail. Alas the rest you've seen before, it will only make you wail. An anti-climax at the end, results in a big flail (quite a few as it happens) and if part three reveals itself, it will be, the final nail.",/review/rw7421764/?ref_=tt_urv

13 October 2021,lareval,3," Not that Carnage, not so much fun and plenty of let downs
","A disappointing and trashy sequel that not only makes the original movie even better now, but features an iconic villain who is vastly underused in here. The 90-minute runtime forces the movie to tell no important story at all (Venom does almost nothing). Even a fine post credits scene (that was completely leaked way before the release) doesn't hype me. An underused, joyless, absurd mess. Plus: almost no joke land here.",/review/rw7421764/?ref_=tt_urv

Those movies he is great but hes absolutely HORRIBLE in venom he is out of place his lines aren't villainous at all he is not intimidating or just plane old doesn't fit the part. Tom hardy is as always PHENOMENAL but this is venon it needs to be like deadpool it HAS TO BE R RATED!!!! It was just ok wait for it to stream see 007 instead.,/review/rw7421764/?ref_=tt_urv
