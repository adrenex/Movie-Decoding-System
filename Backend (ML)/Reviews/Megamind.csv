19 April 2014,TheLittleSongbird,7," An enjoyable sequel
","As someone who loved the first film, while the advertising was not the best it didn't put me off seeing Rio 2. And it was very enjoyable, not as good as the original but it is an example of animated sequels that do work. The story and the pacing are uneven here, with the film getting off to a slightly slow start and feeling rushed in other places, though you do have to admire the energy there is. There are plenty of fun parts with the second half far more compelling than the first and the film rarely has a dull moment, but structurally it is on the thin side and content-wise it feels overstuffed. However, if you want lots of colour, catchy music, fun and good characters and voice acting, Rio 2 very like its predecessor doesn't disappoint. The animation is amazing with lots of vibrant detail especially in the backgrounds and nothing looks hurried or static. The colours are even more brighter and colourful than the first film too. The music has that Brazilian flavour and the songs are incredibly catchy. Don't Go Away is a very touching song, but the highlights are the pizazz-personified Poisonous Love and the hilarious rap version of I Will Survive(thought I'd never say this, can't stand rap on the most part). While the film does feel overstuffed, the content is actually really good, dialogue-wise it's smartly written and has a fair amount of heart while the gags provide plenty of laughs with sharp timing, the best being the soccer match, the jungle auditions and any scene(the Romeo and Juliet part in particular) with Gabi and Nigel. The characters are still engaging, Blu and Jewel are likable lead characters though they had more to do in the first one and Nigel has that menacing streak but is a riot. There are some great new characters as well, with Gabi as good a character as and in some cases even better the original ones. The voice acting adds to that, Jemaine Clement and Kristen Chenoweth are both phenomenal helped by that they have the film's best moments, though Jesse Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway, Andy Garcia and everybody else acquit themselves more than fine too. To conclude, a good sequel to a great original, enjoyed it a lot and when it comes to animated sequels there is definitely much worse(ie. Secret of NIMH 2). 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw5437780/?ref_=tt_urv

","Review: I did prefer the original Rio because of the catchy tunes, but that's not to say that this is a bad movie. The storyline was quite good and the animation looked brilliant. The vibrant colours and the attention to detail was spot on but the jokes weren't as funny as the original. I liked some scenes like the auditions and some of the songs and the new characters were a great addition to the cast. The main problem that I found with the film was that it seemed like there was a lot going on at once. You've got the humans taking down the forest and the main character, Blue, trying to convince his wife that there old life was better than life in the Amazon. Then you've got a human couple who are trying to explore the Amazon and get caught up with thugs who don't want there operation interrupted. Anyway, when you put all of these elements together, it does make a good movie that must have taken a lot of work from the creators, but for some unknown reason, the simpler original was more enjoyable. ",/review/rw5437780/?ref_=tt_urv

","Rio 2 (2014): Dir: Carlos Saldanha / Voices: Jessie Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway, Jemaine Clement, Kristin Chenoweth, Bruno Mars: As with the wretched Crocodile Dundee 2, this animated sequel reverses the events of the first film. This time it is discovered that Blu and Jewel are not the only blue macaws in the world as more have been discovered in the Amazon. Blu and Jewel live in a bird sanctuary under protection but Jewel desires to return to her roots. Blu is reluctant but at the urge of his three ambitious hatchlings and other feathered friends he relents. Once there Jewel is reunited with her family and this is where familiar formula elements rain in. Her uptight father will, of course, not accept Blu, leaving him to have to prove himself. And let us not forget that male suitor who is so much better than Blu at pretty much everything. They are also being pursued by cockatoo Nigel out for revenge on Blu after the events of the first film. He is joined by an affectionate poison dart frog named Gabi and an anteater with a tongue for many talents. Despite dim plotting and formula story telling the climax works with the Amazon clashing with human greed. Jessie Eisenberg voices Blu who is adjusting to non-city life. Anne Hathaway voices Jewel who seeks home. Jemaine Clement and Kristin Chenoweth provide much hilarity voicing Nigel and Gabi. Bruno Mars voices the potential suitor to Jewel whom is slicker than Blu and seems to be better at everything. Unfortunately the gorgeous Amazon presented cannot make up for a drab screenplay that ultimately goes to the birds. Score: 5 ½ / 10",/review/rw5437780/?ref_=tt_urv

This would would kill a film......if it was made by someone like Pixar or Studio Ghibli.

Austin, Amandla Stenberg, Pierce Gagnon, Rita Moreno, Kristin Chenoweth, Tracy Morgan, Will.i.am, and George Lopez Directed By:Carlos Saldanha Review HE'S VILLAINOUS, SHE'S VENOMOUS. You know I actually liked the first Rio movie a lot actually and I didn't even want to see it but my sister made me anyway and I actually thought it was great. When I heard the sequel and saw the trailer a billion times on comcast to rent or own, I knew this would be some generic family animated sequel I wouldn't enjoy and guess what I was right. The Film revolves around Blu, Jewel and their three kids after they're hurtled from Rio de Janeiro to the wilds of the Amazon. As Blu tries to fit in, he goes beak-to-beak with the vengeful Nigel, and meets the most fearsome adversary of all: his father-in-law. The story isn't that interesting, it's basically a generic animated family feature where the main character doesn't want to leave his home because he's so use to things and when he does leave and gets to the Amazon the father of his wife doesn't like him, and there is a much more attractive character that his wife is spending more time with which makes him jealous. It's been done too death and I don't like it. The movie does not achieve it's goal, thanks to its generic story the movie is bland and boring, even if I do like the performances from the actors it's just not that well interesting for me to care about what's going on in the picture. All the elements of a good film are not present it's just bland, generic,boring, and tiresome. With good performances that help not making a stupid waste time.

31 January 2018,Animated_Antic,4," A very disappointing and jumbled mess.
","Most animation studios can turn out great sequels, though sadly Blue Sky Studios strangely enough isn't one of them. While they do succeed at making very enjoyable original movies, their Ice Age sequels don't have a lot of rewatch value. With ""Rio 2"" however, I went in very hopeful. I really enjoyed the first movie with it's beautiful colors, fun songs, likable characters and a pretty good story and hoped the sequel could deliver. Sadly though, I walked out of the movie really disappointed. ""Rio 2"" just falls flat with a story that has way too many plot elements, new characters that are very unlikeable, and song numbers so forgettable and bland that not even Bruno Mars could make them fun. Let me explain why this is.
 
A few years after the first film, Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway) have been living happily with their kids in the grand and glorious city of Rio de Janeiro. However, Jewel feels that her kids are acting a little to much like humans (due to Blu having lived most of his life with a human) and wants them to get back to their natural roots. However when Blu's former owner Linda (Leslie Mann) and her husband Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) discover that more sphinx macaws might be out there, Jewel decides to go to the Amazon to find the tribe which Blu reluctantly agrees to. Along with their friends Nico (Jamie Foxx), Pedro (will.i.am.), and Rafael (George Lopez) they go into the jungle and find the tribe where they meet the leader and Jewel's father, Eduardo (Andy García) as well as Jewel's best friend Roberto (Bruno Mars) and try to get Blu to get into natures ways and also hold a talent show, unaware that a logging company is planning to bulldoze the entire forest and that Nigel (Jemaine Clement), the villain from the last movie has survived the encounter in the last movie and is planning his revenge while also bouncing back to Linda and Tulio from time to time as well have a soccer game that serves no point to the story. Yeah, it's a mess.
 
The story in this movie just has so many plot elements in this film that it just got so confusing and full especially compared to the first film's very simple story. I think the reason why this happened is because the writers of this movie thought that the film needed to be bigger and have some more elements added to it though sadly they had no idea how to do it correctly. I also thought some scenes weren't handled right, particularly the reunion between Jewel and Eduardo. It was so rushed and didn't feel very emotional. Speaking of which, let's talk about the characters. The ones from the first film still have their charm and likable personality, particularly Blu. The new characters on the other hand, that's another story. They're all very unlikeable and even treat some of the characters harshly, especially Eduardo. Words cannot describe my hate for him. The way he treated poor Blu throughout the movie really angered me and finally by the time he called him ""pet"" I lost all faith in him. As for the others, Blu and Jewel's kids were just cliched and I also really wasn't fond of the loggers. I could understand what the writers were trying to go for, but they weren't funny at all compared to the smugglers and also didn't pose a legitimate threat. However, I think one of the biggest mistakes that the movie made was bringing back Nigel. He was a necessary villain for the first film, though bringing him back was pointless. Even his defeat at the end, which I won't spoil, was weak compared to the first film. In fact, he isn't defeated at all. Yeah, what a letdown. The song numbers, though nice, weren't as grand as the first film either. They didn't have anything especially memorable compared to the first film's Oscar nominated song and not even Bruno Mars, whose songs are fantastic, could make it work. The only thing that I could find better than the first movie was the animation. The colors were more grand and eye popping and could look realistic at times, but that was seriously the only thing that I found better.
 
""Rio 2"" just disappointed me. This could have been a great sequel, but it's jumbled story, unlikeable new characters and forgettable songs just made it very unlikeable. I feel bad for Blue Sky as yet this is another sequel that they stumbled up on. If there's any proof from this movie, I think that there are two lessons that they should hopefully learn. Bigger isn't always better, and that they should also stick to making original stories and not sequels. We'll just have to wait and see if they follow that advice.",/review/rw5437780/?ref_=tt_urv

","It had been 9 years since I had seen the original film, made by the creators of Ice Age and Robots, but I do remember enjoying it, despite the long gap of time, I was up for seeing the sequel, directed by Carlos Saldanha (Ferdinand). Basically, Spix's Macaw Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway) and their three children, Bia (Amandla Stenberg), Carla (Rachel Crow), and Tiago (Pierce Gagnon), are living happily in Rio de Janeiro. But Jewel is disappointed to see her children becoming too domesticated like their father. Meanwhile, Blu's former owner, Linda Gunderson (Leslie Mann) and her ornithologist husband Tulio (Love Actually's Rodrigo Santoro) are on an expedition in the Amazon. After a fall down a waterfall, they discover a Spix's macaw feather. When the word gets out about this on television, Jewel believes that they should go to the Amazon to help find the blue macaws. While the kids are ecstatic, Blu is uncertain, but he is pressured into going along, but he has supplies, including a GPS, he believes will help them. Meanwhile, an illegal logging group leader named Big Boss (Miguel Ferrer) discovers Linda and Tulio's expedition, he orders his henchmen to hunt them down to avoid disruptions to their operation. At the same time, the evil cockatoo Nigel (Men in Black 3's Jemaine Clement) seeks revenge against Blu for crippling his ability to fly, and makes several failed attempts to kill Blu along with his new servants, anteater Charlie and poisonous frog Gabi (Kristin Chenoweth), who is in love with Nigel. Blu, his family, and their friends, Rafael the toucan (George Lopez), Pedro the cardinal (will.i.am), and Nico the canary (Jamie Foxx), use a boat to get to the jungle. Arriving, they find nothing, they are eventually taken to a flock of blue macaws that are hiding in uncharted territory. There, they meet Jewel's stern long-lost father, Eduardo (Andy Garcia), her Aunt Mimi (Rita Moreno), and her childhood friend, Roberto (singer Bruno Mars). Eduardo seems unimpressed with Blu; he is grateful to him for bringing Jewel back home but is opposed to Blu's suggestion to expose the sanctuary to Linda and Tulio to ensure their protection. At the same time, Blu is intimidated by the suave Roberto, who quickly bonds with Blu's kids. While searching for the macaws, Linda and Tulio end up captured by the loggers. Blu does his best to fit in with the flock, while Nigel gets closer to him by successfully winning a talent show to become a performer for a Carnival show. When Blu tries to pick a Brazilian nut for Jewel, he accidentally tries to get it in the territory of the Spix macaw's enemies, the scarlet macaws, led by the hostile Felipe (Philip Lawrence). Blu inadvertently causes war between the two tribes, accidentally hitting Felipe with a branch. The football (soccer) style battle ends when Blu accidentally costs the flock their territory. Despite his best intentions and efforts, Blu flies away upset over his failures. Blu decides that he will leave his human roots behind him to build a future with his family. He goes to visit Linda and Tulio but finds their campsite has been raided. Roberto accuses Blu of betraying the flock, but before Blu can defend himself, loggers storm the area. Roberto, unable to deal with real danger, panics and Blu is forced to save him. Blu orders Roberto to warn the flock while he goes to rescue Linda and Tulio. After doing so, Blu persuades the macaws to defend their homes instead of running away. With Blu's knowledge of human technology and help from the scarlet macaws, the flock successfully disable the loggers' machinery. Big Boss tries to blow up the trees instead, but Blu steals the lit dynamite and takes it into the sky where it detonates harmlessly. Big Boss runs off before Linda and Tulio can stop him, but winds up getting eaten by a boa constrictor. Nigel then appears and tries to attack Blu, but Gabi, while attempting to help, accidentally hits Nigel with one of Charlie's pines filled with her poison. Nigel gives a theatrical death speech before seemingly dying, and Gabi then drinks her own poison to die alongside him. But Bia points out that Gabi isn't poisonous at all, and an overjoyed Gabi lovingly smothers a dismayed Nigel and drags him away. With the flock now under Linda and Tulio's protection, Blu and Jewel decide to live in the Amazon with their kids but will continue to visit Rio in the summer. Eduardo finally drops his anti-human stance, and proudly accepts Blu into the flock. Nigel and Gabi are sent to Rio for study, Nico and Pedro's Carnival show goes on, and Luiz the bulldog (30 Rock's Tracy Morgan) arrives at the Amazon for a visit. Also starring Jake T. Austin as Fernando and Janelle Monáe as Dr. Mona. Eisenberg and Hathaway are still good as the two leading blue macaw birds, and the other voices in the cast are fine, but it is Clement as the spiteful cockatoo and Broadway star Chenoweth as the toxic frog infatuated with the villain that both stand out. The use of bright vibrant colours remain wonderful to watch for the places and creatures, and the musical moments are enjoyable enough, especially the operatic ""Poisonous Love"" and a theatrical ""I Will Survive"", it does not have quite the same quality and flair as the original, but it a reasonable animated comedy adventure for all the family.
