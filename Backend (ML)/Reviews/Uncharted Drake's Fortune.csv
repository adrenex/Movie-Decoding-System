28 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Such an original show!
","24 was such an original and exciting show! It was a groundbreaking show that had it all...action, drama, suspense, mystery, twists, excitement, etc. The entire season takes place over the course of 24hrs with each episode making up one hour. It's about a Counter Terrorism Unit led by an agent named Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) as they race to save the country from terrorists. Not every season was great but most were and they're all worth watching! It was an action packed thriller that kept you on the edge of your seat throughout the series! Kiefer Sutherland was absolutely perfect as Jack Bauer! If you enjoy action packed shows where you can't wait to see what happened next then this is the show for you?",/review/rw8100125/?ref_=tt_urv

8 May 2021,Supermanfan-13,9," Action Packed Thriller!
",24 was one of my favorite shows growing up. It was absolutely ahead of its time when it came out and is still great today. No show at the time had you at the edge of your seat every episode quite like 24. The 24 hour clock was so original at the time. This was a a show where every season not only had the great Jack Bauer as the hero but every season had a great villain too. There were also so many twists and turns that it would have you guessing what what happen next. This is a show that will hook you right from the beginning and keep you entertained every episode of every season. This truly is a one of a kind show with non stop action.,/review/rw8100125/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2023,aleks_larsen,10," One of my favourites
",This show is unique. Never seen a show like this even 20 years after it started. This was a show that got my family and friends to sit down every week to watch togheter. There is few shows that can be this action packed for almost an hour times 20 episodes and doing it for many seasons. This is conspiracy theories going real. Even if its action action action it also feels slow paced wich doesnt make you feel its going to fast.,/review/rw8100125/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2022,darrenhutchison,10," Revolutionary
","Whether you like this show or not, it changed tv forever. Never was there such a big budget, movie star cast and amazing production before 24. This started the trend of that. The money men saw that this was big business and started to flood shows with cash. Also got more movie actors that would never have thought of going into tv, which before was a poisoned chalice, classed as a major step down. TV shows were a stepping stone to movies and I guess they still are, but you can now move between both without being labelled. The only time you could do that before is if you guest starred on something like Colombo or something. But even then, it was usually a movie star that had a stalled career for some reason. Anyway, I loved 24 and still do. Still stands up today and very fun to watch. Ok it gets kinda formulaic after a few seasons, but it's like watching Star Trek, you know it's all gonna be fine by the end but you still watch it. Jack Bauer is a great character and Kiefer plays him so well. If you haven't watched it, you're simply missing out.",/review/rw8100125/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,jordanando,10," Television at its finest
",There's something about how television was made in this era that makes the experience of watching this show ten times more worth it. Without the crystal clear picture of 4K that we are used to and such a great example of method acting this show is a 10/10,/review/rw8100125/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2020,dishjones,8," Jack Bauer
",The first 4 seasons were so incredible. It was a tough premise to keep up though. Cracks started appearing in season 5 and season 6 just became down right ridiculous. But Jack Bauer is one of the best TV characters ever created and Kiefer Sutherland was born to play this part. This show was the definition of serial thrill ride. My friends and I used to have weekly viewing parties and if you broke the gag order on spoilers you were dead to us. Some of the funniest times I've ever had watching a show. It was more like an experience.,/review/rw8100125/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2022,Mountaineer007,9," Entertainment, Consistency, Characters, Wow!
","Season 1 started in the year 2001 and season 8 ended in the year 2010. I watched this entire series for the first time in the year 2022 and believe me it does not feel boring for a single season even after a decade/couple of decades later. Characters, locations, timelapse, casting, music are so perfectly developed during the series. I liked the twists this series presents throughout the episodes. Almost all the time you can never correctly guess who is the real villain and his henchmen are.",/review/rw8100125/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2018,fatelovesthefearless,10," The best action show ever made
","24 is the best action show ever made and one of the most entertaining shows I've ever watched. I actually can't believe all the negative reviews but it doesn't surprise me as most action movies get lots of negative reviews too. But I guess if your not into the genre why watch? Jack Bauer and John Maclean are very similar so I'd describe 24 as the tv version of Die Hard. Both men work in law enforcement and usually have a personal stake in the story, and both are about terrorists and how one man does his best to stop the terrorists, sometimes working with or against the law and both almost die multiple times. So yeah if your a fan of action and liked Die Hard then you'll love 24.",/review/rw8100125/?ref_=tt_urv

12 May 2002,G-Man-25,," A Bona-Fied TV Classic!
","This show definitely has re-written the book on intelligent and credible suspense on TV.  Extremely well acted, written and directed.  Truly gripping, heart-stopping suspense from one hour to the next.  The show is so well done that you can easily forgive the very few plot devices that seem a little weak.  When a show gets 99% of everything right, it's very hard to quibble.  Keifer Sutherland has never been better as the flawed hero. ""24"" deserves to be a model on which all future TV suspense thrillers can be compared to.  A+++",/review/rw8100125/?ref_=tt_urv

23 June 2022,sumityoutubw,8," A tense thriller for adults and mature teens.
","A US action thriller television series, first broadcast in 2001. The series is about the activities of the fictional US government organization Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) which tries to protect the country from terrorists. Most of the action takes place in Los Angeles and Washington D. C. The main character, Jack Bauer, is played by Kiefer Sutherland. The action is shown in real time so that each minute of the programmes equals a minute in the lives of the characters. Each season of programmes covers 24 hours. The series has won Emmy and Golden Globe Awards.",/review/rw8100125/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2022,nihalbhat2,9," Review for Season 3- jack bauer TV greatest action hero
","Season 3 is excellent. Gripping, a lot of plot twists, and non stop action and tension make for compelling viewing. The villain is also excellent. There are shades of bond, die hard and the best of other franchises. The stakes are high. Sutherland gives one of his best performances in season 3 and there is no better modern day action hero in TV. Still to this date- 2022, 24 season 3 is ahead of its time.",/review/rw8100125/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2001,cchase,9," Innovation is this show's saving grace and its damnation...
","It's been said a couple of times already, but in this particular era where ADD seems to be more of a national condition than just the learning abberation that afflicts a certain group, ""24"" was allegedly doomed from Episode One. When part of the thrill is seeing how the creative team behind this concept can successfully juggle all the story ""balls"" they're keeping in the air each week, how can this show possibly survive, when it's competing against such Top Ten 'gems' as TEMPTATION ISLAND 2, SURVIVOR and FEAR FACTOR?",/review/rw8100125/?ref_=tt_urv

9 June 2004,tfrizzell,," TickTockTickTockTickTockTickTockTickTockTickTockTickTock....
","A creative and revolutionary television program that could best be described as ""High Noon"" for the 21st Century X and Y generational groups starved for cinema-like ideas and executions. ""24"" (representing the number of hours in a day) runs an hour a week, in real time, and advances to a staggering climax as an anti-terrorist specialist (Kiefer Sutherland) races against the clock to save the day. Assassination attempts, germ warfare and anti-American enemies are constant obstacles for Sutherland, daughter Elisha Cuthbert, president Dennis Haysbert and an innumerable cast of others. Regulars come and go, guest stars make lasting impressions and cliff-hanger sequences will leave you gasping for air and possibly grasping your chest to calm your heart down. So many things happen over the course of one day on this show (you would not believe everything that goes on over such a short period of time) that it is sometimes hard to remember everything and at times many situations are trivial anyway (there is so much time to fill that it is near impossible to make every minute count). Sutherland and Haysbert (who made their names on the big screen) are top-flight performers and they prove to be the biggest assets. Excellent direction and good scripts (for the most part) have lingering effects on the audience as the clock ticks and tocks to a mind-numbing finale each season. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",/review/rw8100125/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2005,Darguz,," A Nice Try, but Vastly Overrated
","First, let me say that there is first-rate acting all around in this show. Sutherland and everyone else do a marvelous job. There are some interesting characters, well-written. And the format, of course, is the inspired part.",/review/rw8100125/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2022,win_kk,10," Best show after GOT
","Yup, like the title said the only TV show that I am really into after Game of Throne. Very good acting from everyone especially Kiefer. Story is great, very interesting, intense and enjoyable every moment of it. I also learned a bit about how government track and monitor bad people using surveillance and technology.",/review/rw8100125/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2002,johnm_001,," Superb Television
","I didn't watch ""24"" during its original, first-season run, so I can't comment on how it played, week after week; but, I did watch all 24 episodes on DVD, over a four day period.  WOW!  From beginning to end, this show is the most riveting and suspenseful thing ever captured on film.  It is a masterwork of deceit, and its success is in the fact that it never allows the viewer to relax for a second.  You are never sure who you can trust. Certainly one of, if not the best 24 hours of television, ever!  Highly recommended!",/review/rw8100125/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show can best be described as the most innovative, ground-breaking television show of the past 50 years. The reason this show is so ground breaking is the fact that it has used split screen cameras, and a real time format to create the element of a quality made show.",/review/rw8100125/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2022,ZacAttack98,10," One of the Best Action Shows of All Time
","Each season consists of 24 episodes with each episode acting as a one hour period in the show. This is where the name ""24"" comes from with each season being the equivalence of one full day. The show bounces back and forth between various characters and situations that are all happening at the same time. The main protagonist Jack Bauer does whatever he can to protect the national security of the United States while at the same time protecting the ones he loves. The theme of doing things for the greater good often comes into play and Jack is faced with incredibly difficult choices and has to deal with the consequences of his actions. The show typically revolves around The White House, the Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU), and the boots on the ground carrying out their orders. I love how the show depicts the highest level in the chain of command down to the individual putting in the work. The way the show depicts one situation from various perspectives is masterfully done and incredibly immersive! You be on the edge of your seat the entire time! I can't recommend this show enough! It is a must watch for action fans!",/review/rw8100125/?ref_=tt_urv
