16 August 2005,philip_vanderveken,7," Completely absurd and over the top, but that's the way this kind of movies should be
","I guess it's quite obvious that those who didn't like the first ""Hot Shots"" movie just shouldn't give this movie a try. But for the fans of that one, and I'm one of them, this movie promised to offer a lot more pleasure and laughter. What has always appealed to me is the fact that they try to make fun of so many other movies. This time they have re-used parts from movies like ""Rambo"", ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Terminator"", ""The Lady and the Tramp""... Trying to find all those references is already a big part of the fun, especially when you already know most of those movies.",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2006,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," A little over the top, but it's all good
","After being really happy with the first Hot Shots, I was excited to see the next and I have to say that Part Deux was still a ton of fun. Despite the fact that I know that this film may be a little silly and over the top with the jokes, it still was a lot of fun to watch. I think everyone needs an outrageous comedy here and there. Charlie Sheen is an absolute blast to watch, this time, they are taking on Rambo, Predator, Commando, Basic Instinct, and many other references.",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2013,Hey_Sweden,8," ""We'll settle this the old Navy way...first guy to die loses!""
","""Hot Shots! Part Deux"" beats the odds to be pretty good, not just as spoofs go, but as spoof *sequels* go. Granted, it's not always very funny, but enough of the verbal and visual jokes work to make this solidly entertaining comedy fare, and a worthy sequel to the hilarious first movie. It goes about making fun of the corpse littered action escapism films of the 1980s, which of course were a genre just ripe for parody. Charlie Sheen returns as hero Topper Harley, now living in Thailand after getting his heart broken by Ramada (Valeria Golino). He's approached by the CIA to undertake a top secret mission in the Middle East where he must rescue the rescue team who went in to save the rescue team who tried to retrieve some hostages.",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2003,gridoon,7," Consistently funny and entertaining - one of the best spoofs.
","It's surprising how much fresher this movie looks and plays compared to most other spoofs of the 90's. It's a reminder (which you may need after watching films like ""Dracula:Dead and Loving It"") that ANY genre can work with the right amount of effort put into it. Maybe it does have a few duds here and there, but there are far more surrealistic gems along the way (""Geronimoooo!"". ""Geronimoooo!"". ""Meeeee!""). One of the best of its kind.

21 April 2009,planktonrules,7," 100% stupid...and is that so bad?!
","The original HOT SHOTS was a fabulous film and was more polished and fresh than this remake. However, this is not to say this sequel is bad--it still maintains an excellent pace and will make you laugh. That's because even more than the original, the jokes come so rapid fire that if one falls flat (as many do), there is no doubt a good laugh coming only moments later.",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2004,wliia,10," Damn funny!! Recommended for slapstick lovers!!
","What can I say about this movie? A comic moment at every turn, hilarious lines and a great spoof to live by. I, being a Ryan Stiles fan, couldn't stop laughing when I first saw this. His performance was top, and Charlie Sheen just brought it all together. My favourite moments included when Dexter (Rowan Atkinson) mentioned his shoelaces being tied together, and when the army wrote the sounds of the morse code (Dah di di dah dah di dah)! Couldn't stop laughing!!! The casting is great, with Lloyd Bridges as the President and Ryan Stiles as Rainbowitz, this is a great movie spoof! I recommend this movie for slapstick fans and people who just want a laugh, a lot of laughs!!",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2006,lee_eisenberg,10," all the way
","Knowing that ""Hot Shots! Part Deux"" is from the ""Airplane!"" crowd should immediately identify that the whole thing is an excuse to be silly. And they do just that. Mostly spoofing the ""Rambo"" movies - but also various other flicks and even George H.W. Bush barfing on Japan's PM - they play everything for all that it's worth. OK, so maybe this is low humor, but still, there isn't a dull moment anywhere in the movie. It's impossible not to like. Charlie Sheen, Lloyd Bridges, Valeria Golino, and Jerry Haleva reprise their roles from the original, and there's also Rowan Atkinson (that's right: Mr. Bean!) this time around. So see it; you're sure to like it.",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2005,rmax304823,7," Exhilarating farce
","Alright, this is a sequel and the frame is familiar, but it's still pretty funny and at times sidespittingly so.",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2005,nifelhem,10," Greatest comedy ever!
","OK, let's get this clear; Hot shots IS silly. Silly, simple, stupid and ABSOLUTELY pointless. But hey, it IS a slapstick comedy, and a ******* GREAT ONE! MUCH better than the first movie! In EVERY SECOND of the movie there is a gag, a joke, or someone or something that is so damn funny that I can't help myself from falling of the chair laughing like hell! I think I've seen this movie over 20 times, It's still the funniest movie ever for me. I guess when it comes to movies of this kind, I just want them to be as stupid, with as many jokes per minute, as possible. I think Charlie Sheen is perfect for this role, he does look serious, like some kind of a bad Rambo-wannabe, and a serious-looking person doing stupid things is always great. It's also great that Richard Crenna plays almost the same character as in Rambo 3, with many of his lines unchanged. If you've watched the Rambo-movies, (most important the third one), you'll get more of the gags and the dialogs, especially in the scenes from the Buddhist temple. Saddam Hussein is also excellent, he looks really like the real one! If you like stupid and crazy movies...WATCH THIS!",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2002,Agent10,7," Comedy parte de dos
","While the original will always be considered better, this film still held true to the Hot Shots mentality. While the whole concept may have been a little dragged out, at least they didn't try to make another movie to further destroy this franchise. Charlie Sheen was once again, Charlie Sheen. With yet another tongue-in-cheek performance, Sheen proves to us he is one of the most nonchalant comedy actor of our day. Plenty of funny things to talk about, but far too many to mention.",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2009,TheUnknown837-1,7," precisely the sort of comedy that a movie-lover like myself enjoys
","I don't know if I've ever seen a comedy as zany or as randomly silly as ""Hot Shots! Part Deux."" Then again, I'm not all that familiar with the comedy genre, but I can say that between this movie and its predecessor, every pratfall, every parody, every little joke has been done. Part Deux is even crazier and more random than its nonsensically silly prequel and it's even less intelligent, but strangely enough, it's a lot more enjoyable. I thought the first ""Hot Shots!"" was a promising hit-and-miss satire; Part Deux succeeds.",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2007,directorscut,10," The under-appreciated masterpiece of the 1990s.
","Let it be etched on stone: Since HOT SHOTS! PART DEUX was released American comedy cinema has been in a steep decline. Part of the reason for this is that HOT SHOTS! PART DEUX is an Everest of film-making that has yet to been scaled since. And once you reach the peak the only way is down. HOT SHOTS! PART DEUX has everything. It is the most consistently side-splittingly funny film since Chaplin and Keaton at their peak. It is the most devastating and uplifting story of love, war and sacrifice since CASABLANCA and it has rip-roaring action scenes (Die! Energizer! Bunny! Die!) on par with the mighty movies it is (lovingly) parodying. Charlie Sheen, despite his off-screen propensities, has always been an agreeable screen presence and here he delivers his performances for the ages. Valeria Golino is a goddess for all the ages and also displays impeccable comedic skills. She also kicks a considerable amount of butt without ever losing her grace and femininity. This is quite possibly the last great American female role with substance to it and sadly none have close since.",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv

27 May 2021,kosmasp,9," Magnifique - Rambo
","I stand by what I thought or had in mind for the two movies I rewatched the other day ... Hot Shots one is good ... but Part Deux ... tops that! Really well done to say the least and adding to the ""mythology"" of the main character. Also kind of wiping away everything or most of what we got to know about the characters from the first movie.",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2009,splatwacker,10," In no laughing contests, this is my kryptonite.
","Its a piece of art, designed for one thing; making you laugh till you cry from it. I think its still getting more and more popular because when people watch it over they laugh for whole new reasons. I've probably watched it over twenty times, and I still find little spots of humor that I had missed in the nineteen other viewings. If you have never seen it, seriously put it in your life goals to watch this movie! May be you should save it for the day your sole mate dies... I think it will help.",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2003,=G=,7," Don't call me Shirley!
","If you liked the original spoof-a-rama, ""Airplane"", or any of Abrahams' slampooning flicks from ""Police Squad"" to ""Naked Gun"", you'll like ""Hot Shots: Part Deux"" with Sheen as a Rambo knock-off gunning for Saddam Hussein. There's never a dull moment in this gag-a-second flick which borrows bits and pieces from ""Apocalypse Now"" to ""Star Wars"" and beyond in its rampage of nonstop silliness. A must see for spoof junkies who don't mind putting their brain on hold for 90 minutes of slaphappy nonsense. (B)",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2014,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7," Don't worry - we critics did like it
","Saddam(Haleva, looking the part) has taken hostages taken by a foreign dictator, and several failed rescue attempts, the US is running out of specialists to send in. Topper(Sheen, doing a good Rambo) is tracked down, but he's heartbroken over the loss of Ramada(Golino, sultry as ever). Maybe something will motivate him... like Crenna playing the same role he did in the First Blood series.",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2017,zkonedog,9," Spoofs & Sight Gags Galore!
","It is rare that a film based on sight gags can get released period, much less spawn a sequel. Look at the ""Airplane"" movies. The first one was hilarious and deserves a place in the ""greatest comedies of all-time"" category. The second effort? Not so much. Remarkably, though, ""Hot Shots 2"" actually exceeds its predecessor by spoofing a specific film genre: the action flick.",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2008,jboothmillard,4," Hot Shots! Part Deux
","The first film was really funny with the main spoof being Top Gun, and this sequel does have some good small laughs and recognisable films spoofs, but I suppose it isn't as good as the previous. Basically Topper Harley (Charlie Sheen) has been found working at a monastery, and the CIA need him to help to lead a rescue team into Iraq to save captured soldiers. Throughout the film we also see the clumsy and idiotic encounters with President Thomas 'Tug' Benson (Lloyd Bridges), and some flashbacks to Topper's past love interest Ramada Rodham Hayman (Valeria Golino), who he is reunited with later on. The spoofs I recognised were the obvious Rambo films, The Adventures of Robin Hood, The Wizard of Oz, Basic Instinct, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, Lady and the Tramp, Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Commando, Predator, Star Wars, Gladiators and there were many more. Also starring Richard Crenna as Col. Denton Walters, Brenda Bakke as Michelle Rodham Huddleston, Miguel Ferrer as Commander Arvid Harbinger, Rowan Atkinson as Dexter Hayman, Jerry Haleva as Saddam Hussein, David Wohl as Gerou, Mitchell Ryan as Sen. Gray Edwards, Michael Colyar as Williams and Ryan Stiles as Rabinowitz. The jokes can be a little bit repetitive and obvious as times, and the stupidity of the characters borders on annoying occasionally, but it has amusing bit and pieces. Okay!",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2018,nims-1975,8," Very funny with great action and humour
","Hot Shots Part Deux is a film which I really enjoyed watching. I haven't watched or seen the first Hot Shots film starring Charlie Sheen but I will do as soon as possible, so I can't compare this sequel to it, but it was an enjoyable film to watch with great action, humour and a great cast. The acting by Charlie Sheen as Topper Harley, Lloyd Bridges as Tug Benson, Valeria Golino as Ramada Rodham Hayman, Richard Crenna as Col. Denton Walters, Brenda Bakke as Michelle Rodham Huddleston, Miguel Ferrer as Harbinger, Ryan Stiles as Rabinowitz, Michael Colyar as Williams, Jerry Haleva as Saddam Hussein and Rowan Atkinson as Dexter Hayman was excellent. It was great to see Ryan Stiles (who plays Dr Herb Melnick in Two and a Half Men) act in this film with Charlie Sheen. The character he played of Rabinowitz in this sequel was also very funny and entertaining to watch. This film did use parts from films such as 'Rambo' and 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day', but it was alright because the films action and humour went well with the storyline of the film. Hot Shots Part Deux may not be excellent, but it is a very good film.",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2007,ccthemovieman-1,," Cheap Shots - Part 2,000
","Well, I guess the fact that a son of ultra-liberal Martin Sheen would wind up like his dad is no surprise. Here, Charlie and his character, ""Toppr Harley"" make fun of the President of the United States. (This was made when George Bush Sr., was in office. These cheap shots against the U.S. leader mysteriously halted when a Liberal took over the rest of the decade.). Anyway, the idea here was the make the President look as stupid as possible.",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2018,BA_Harrison,5," Not so hot.
","Writer/director Jim Abrahams spoofs Rambo (as well as Terminator 2, Basic Instinct, Star Wars and The Wizard of Oz), with Charlie Sheen returning as heroic Topper Harley, who leads a team of soldiers to Iraq on a mission to rescue hostages taken during Desert Storm (and to free the men who were sent to rescue the men who were sent to rescue the hostages).",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,Leofwine_draca,7," Superior sequel
","I always found this sequel far superior to the somewhat laboured first movie. It's still below the quality of the NAKED GUN trilogy but otherwise it works well although it's perhaps a little too silly, even stupid, to be considered a classic. Sheen reprises his role in a story that spoofs RAMBO III, and even Richard Crenna's along for the ride. There's a good cast in this one and some handy special effects, along with a non-stop barrage of movie references. I think my favourite bit is the T-1000 sequence which has the same level of FX proficiency as TERMINATOR 2. Always like Belinda Bakke in this one, too; she's having a ball.",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv

","Was this the last great spoof movie ever made? I admit that it's not as good as ""Airplane!"" or ""Naked Gun"", but it's still platinum compared to today's parody movies. I haven't seen the first one, but I was recommended to this by Doug Walker. This film is really funny and just keeps giving out joke after joke, most of which hit bullseyes. It's probably Charlie Sheen at his funniest. I realize how topical these spoof movies were.",/review/rw4208714/?ref_=tt_urv
