5 March 2007,michaelRokeefe,7," On the racetrack, he has all the right moves.
","A very good Tom Cruise action flick; and talk about action...he has the right moves on and off the track. Cruise plays Cole Trickle, an arrogant hotshot with minimum experience driving a stock car, but an uncanny ability to hold his own on the track. He impresses a two-faced Randy Quaid enough to get a car and veteran driver Robert Duvall to build it. Trickle enters a rivalry with the top driver(Michael Rooker), but tragedy introduces him to self-discovery and a beautiful neurosurgeon(Nicole Kidman). Trickle takes on the toughest odds and becomes an even better driver. Also in the cast: Cary Elwes, Fred Dalton Thompson and John C. Reilly. The racing scenes will bring back that feeling evoked by TOP GUN. A hard thumping soundtrack features the likes of: Joan Jett, Elton John, Chicago, Tina Turner and Maria McKee. And yes, it is hard not to notice the Cruise/Kidman chemistry.",/review/rw4067441/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2015,Quinoa1984,6," some good Towne-script moments and a superb cast, but...
","Yeah, Top Gun is the one that made all the very BIG bucks back in 1986 and put Tony Scott and Tom Cruise on the map in bigger ways then they had been before (not to mention producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer), but somehow, much as with De Palma/Pacino with Scarface and Carlito's Way, the follow-up seemed to probably be the actual better film of the two. Does this mean that Days of Thunder, following the travails of an up-and-comer racecar star (Cruise), is a really good movie? Well, in some ways yes, and in other ways not so much.",/review/rw4067441/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2007,LuboLarsson,6," I feel the need, the need for Speed
","The producers, director and star of Top Gun get together again for this above average racing drama. Its nowhere near as good as Top Gun of course but its no disaster. Tom Cruise is good as the daftly named racing driver Cole Trickle and the ever reliable Robert Duvall offers classy support. Michael Rooker is excellent as Toms rival and Randy Quaid shows a more serious side to those who only know him from the Vacation movies. Surprisingly the usually good Nicole Kidman is rather bland as the love interest although to be fair she's not given a heck of a lot to work with. The music is of course all important in a movie like this and it has a pretty good soundtrack including Maria McKee's Number One hit Show Me Heaven, but again Top Gun had a much better soundtrack with Hans Zimmmer no match for Harold Faltermeyer. Tony Scott directs with his usual style, if you have seen Top Gun or Beverly Hills Cop 2 you'll no what to expect, very flashy and VERY LOUD. With a slightly less predictable story this could have been a lot better but as it is its a pretty enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours.",/review/rw4067441/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2008,bkoganbing,8," The Need For More Speed
","If I had to guess the genesis for Days of Thunder had its place in two areas. First the fact that Top Gun proved to be such a mega-hit for Tom Cruise that a similar film was almost dictated to be made by Paramount. But secondly it was reported that on the set of The Color of Money, co-star Paul Newman got Cruise interested in auto racing so you put those two things together, Days of Thunder was almost a film that had to be made.",/review/rw4067441/?ref_=tt_urv

24 March 2009,barundash_123,7," Cruise Blasts as Cole Trickle
","Tom Cruise cruises like thunder as Cole Trickle in Jerry Bruckheimer's, Days of Thunder. Cole Trickle, a name that became an icon, an inspiration and a hero for auto racing drivers way back in early 90's. An enthralling and roller coaster ride jammed with high octane racing action, enough to blast you off the seat. Days of Thunder gave birth to the sparkling chemistry between once upon a time two of the most memorable on-screen and off-screen couples Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.",/review/rw4067441/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2007,ccthemovieman-1,6," 'Top Gun' Tom On The Ground
","Boy, Tom Cruise had that obnoxious character down pat for quite some time, didn't he? Here is yet another film in which he plays that type of annoying character you want to slap in the face (or something else). Yeah, if you liked Top Gun and his other ""pretty-boy"" films of this period - and some were pretty good, actually - you might like this. In fact, this film might be more popular now since NASCAR is televised so much more these days. This movie may get a new audience. Frankly, I could care less about auto racing, back then and now, but I don't hate it, I love most other sports and I like a good movie. This was only fair in all categories. Not bad; not good.",/review/rw4067441/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2018,Leofwine_draca,5," Slick but shallow
","DAYS OF THUNDER is a typically slick car racing thriller from Tony Scott, the kind of film which looks flashy and expensive but has little actual depth or insight into the sport or those who participate as it. It's one of those films starring a youthful Tom Cruise whom the camera loves so much that he positively radiates throughout. He's also a little too good to be true. The film mainly charts the rivalry between Cruise and a rival driver (the great Michael Rooker), but that kind of situation was done more realistically in the likes of RUSH. The car scenes are appropriately shot and Scott knows how to make the chrome look good. Cast-wise, Robert Duvall does well as the spiky manager, but Nicola Kidman is way out of her depth as the unnecessary love interest.",/review/rw4067441/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2007,xwhenseasonschangex,8," By all standards I shouldn't enjoy this movie.....
","First of all this movie has Tom Cruise in it, which to be honest is the reason that I hesitated for so long to see it. Secondly It's about NASCAR for Christ's sake! The problem is, I did enjoy it. I believe its for the reasons that I mentioned that I actually did enjoy it. An escapist sort of entertainment that puts you in a place that you would really never even consider going. I was forced to rent this recently by a friend and after sitting about 15 minutes in to it I just let go and let the colors and sounds wash over me. This movie is the visual equivalent of a music video with dialog. Every scene is short and to the point, and if its forward momentum you are looking for in your movies then you've come to the right place. The entire duration of the movies length I kept thinking that I wish there were more movies made that took you to another world the way this one does. Tony Scott you've done it again sir, Congratulations!",/review/rw4067441/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2004,bob the moo,," Painting by numbers produces an average film despite the cast
","Eager for a winning formula, team owner Tim Daland puts together the inexperienced but naturally talented Cole Trickle and the retired but skilled mechanic Harry Hogge to hopefully bounce off each other to create a winning combination. After the expected bumps and friction between the two, they seem to blend well and start winning races. However, a major accident between Cole and his main rival, Rowdy Burns, puts them both in the hospital under the care of the professional and leggy Dr Lewicki. But will Cole be able to overcome the physical and mental scars that he got.",/review/rw4067441/?ref_=tt_urv

","Anyone that doesn't like this movie should have their head examined.  It has everything you want in a film.  Cars, women, great acting, and an awesome soundtrack.  You can't beat it, it's that simple.  The racing scenes were ahead of their time, and the soundtrack is so moving that you will always leave this movie with a smile on your face and a soothed soul.",/review/rw4067441/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2003,tfrizzell,," The Wheels on the Race-Car Go Round and Round, Round and Round, Round and Round.
","The world of car-racing has never been too exciting to me. It is a sport that just seems kind of dumb as cars run around in circles for hours on end. Fans of the sport are fanatics though and look at the contests as spiritual events. While ""Days of Thunder"" never did change my views of competitive auto-racing, I still found this movie to be surprisingly impressive. An adrenaline rush that makes something that is very dull to me be very intriguing. However with that said, ""Days of Thunder"" succeeds because of its characters and their relationships with one another and not its mind-blowing cinematography and editing during the race sequences. Tom Cruise literally comes out of nowhere one day and claims that there is nothing he cannot do with a race-car. Of course old-time crew chief Robert Duvall (making a perfect appearance as usual) soon realizes that the cocky Cruise is an out-of-this-world driver, but also discovers that the youngster really has a minimal knowledge of anything that has to do with cars other than driving. Soon they create a father-son bond that propels them to legitimacy in the race world. A terrible accident early on though leads Cruise to meet neurologist Nicole Kidman and romance blossoms very quickly. Cruise's hot temper though creates trouble with sponsors (Randy Quaid), NASCAR officials (Fred Dalton Thompson) and even fellow competitors (most notably Michael Rooker and Cary Elwes). As the film progresses it is made quite clear that Cruise, a man who seemed to not need anyone early on, needs Kidman and Duvall in his life. Tom Cruise come up with this story with legendary screenwriter Robert Towne (most notable for his work on ""Chinatown"" and he even wrote a portion of ""The Godfather"", going uncredited, as well). Towne handled the actual screen-writing duties by himself and does a completely under-rated job here. This movie has always been shunned by most critics and the general public. However, the old ""Formula One"" way of making a movie is more than adequate here. The chemistry on the silver screen between Cruise and Kidman cannot be denied and Duvall's ability to be so natural and wise in productions like this make him a very impressive asset. Definitely flawed, ""Days of Thunder"" still comes out winning the checkered flag. 4 stars out of 5.",/review/rw4067441/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2009,msmary,6," Fun Film But Lots of Goofs
","I like NASCAR, and I enjoyed Days of Thunder. The opening sequence at the Daytona 500 gives me goosebumps and makes me want to crank up the surround sound - a homage to NASCAR, the late 80s, and Americana. There were other fun sequences in the movie, like when Cole Trickle is crashing his car every week and when his crew played a prank on him after winning his first race. The movie came out during the height of the ""Tom Cruise is Cool"" era. And, Cruise is cool in this movie. Robert Duvall, who plays his crew chief, is even better in the film.",/review/rw4067441/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wealthy Tim Daland (Randy Quaid) brings in newcomer Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise) to race his car. He also recruits veteran crew chief Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall) to lead Cole's pit crew. Cole is reckless and inexperienced. The brash rookie starts getting pushed around by the Winston Cup champion Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker). Eventually he admits his lack of knowledge to Hogge who helps him become one of the best racer on the circuit. He crashes into Rowdy Burns sending both of them to the hospital. There they are treated by Dr. Claire Lewicki (Nicole Kidman). While Cole is injured, Daland hires hot new driver Russ Wheeler (Cary Elwes) to replace him.",/review/rw4067441/?ref_=tt_urv

","Days of Thunder is definitely my favorite movie of all time.  I'm a huge racing fan and I was very happy when I first heard of this movie back in 1990.  I even went to Hardees and got all the little toy cars.  It's jammed with action and if you like Top Gun, there is no way you can't like this film.

",In the Top Gun genre although without the homo eroticism. But a great performance from Duvall who lights up the screen every time he is on - which is often. Nicole Kidman lights up the screen as well and not just for her acting! Cruise is OK as the foil to Duvall's Harry. Tony Scott's direction is standard for a Bruckenheimer film and deserves applause.,/review/rw4067441/?ref_=tt_urv

","Tony Scott and Tom Cruise reunite in an attempt to replicate the success of Top Gun. Days of Thunder, however, is not Top Gun. It doesn't have the inherent entertainment value or iconic moments. It's a mostly mediocre affair with occasional flashes of inspiration.
The most noteworthy thing is probably seeing the burgeoning real-life romance between Cruise and Kidman.",/review/rw4067441/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw Rush (2013) and then I saw Days of Thunder (1990), and the result is obvious, lame. The chemistry between the racer and his car maker/crew chief, with his girl Kidman, with his rival, Cruise's charm, nothing really captivates. Apart from the racing scenes, hardly anything to catch your eye, an overall drab affair, a racing fan may just pass through this and for that I give it a generous 6.",/review/rw4067441/?ref_=tt_urv
