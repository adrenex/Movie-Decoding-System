15 August 2016,Fella_shibby,9," A very good revenge drama/thriller/action flick.
","I first saw this film in 2008 on a DVD. I enjoyed it. The movie was very well made. Kevin Bacon gav an excellent performance as a father seeking revenge. The movie never slows down or gets boring. John Goodman also appears in a nice cameo role. Fans of Death Wish, The Brave One, Harry Brown, The Punisher, Law abiding citizen shud definitely check this out. I was most impressed by the camera work in the chase scenes. I was rooting for the lead character from the word go and Bacon did not let me down. Death sentence was a great thrill ride from the emotional opening credits to the chilling conclusion. At times it was brutal, gory n depressing. The music by Charlie Clouser (Saw series, The collection, Resident evil extinction) was very effective at establishing the proper mood. It has some hard hitting action, fantastic foot chase, some amazing gun fights n some unique death scenes. The soundtrack is very depressing and moody and helps set the tone of the film. Its directed by James Wan (Saw, Dead silence, Insidous, Conjuring, Fast n furious 7). Nice cinematography by John R. Leonetti (Conjuring, Insidious). It's based on the book (sequel to the original Deathwish) written by Brian Garfield, the author of Death wish.",/review/rw1725621/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2008,TomCruiseFan99,8," Vengeance, pure and simple
","Reminiscent of previous vigilante films like Death Wish and The Brave One, this film is much more action-packed and gripping. Kevin Bacon gives an excellent performance as a traumatised father who witnessed his son's murder and decides to punish the killers himself, rather than depend on the police.",/review/rw1725621/?ref_=tt_urv

","Nothing new and exciting here for what is fast becoming a tired old genre, but boasting the considerable talents of Kevin Bacon in the lead role, Death Sentence is way above average and never outstays its welcome.

","The family man and senior vice-president of the insurance company Starship Capital Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) lives a comfortable life with his wife Helen (Kelly Preston) and his sons Brendan (Stuart Lafferty) and Lucas (Jordan Garrett). While driving back home with his son Brendan after a game of hockey, Nick stops his car in a gas station in a dangerous neighborhood and he witnesses his son being murdered by the punk Joe Darley (Matt O'Leary) in the convenience store. When the prosecutor tells the grieving Nick that Joe would get a maximum of three years in prison, Nick tells the judge in court that he has not recognized Joe as the killer of his son. In the night, Nick goes to Joe's place and stabs him to death. When Joe's brother Billy (Garrett Hedlund) is informed about the death of Joe, he summons his gang in a war against Nick with tragic consequences.",/review/rw1725621/?ref_=tt_urv

31 August 2007,protector2222,8," pretty good
",I thought this movie was great. I think Bacon never fails to perform. The movies he picks to do show a lot of his depth as he very rarely plays a one dimensional character. There was a story to this movie. A very complicated story. If you didn't notice the story you got distracted by the violence. Some of the dialogue was cheesy but that is what makes it great.,/review/rw1725621/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2016,Quinoa1984,6," revenge is a dish best served with Bacon!
","I've been told over time through industry professionals, sometimes in classes I've taken, quotes from movie stars and writers and directors and so on, that if you have a good script and a mediocre director you can still have a decent film, but if the script is terrible it doesn't matter how great the director is but the project won't be able to fly. I still am not sure if James Wan is a great director - he really has a mixed record for me now that I've seen most of his films (in brief, Saw sucks, Conjuring 1 & 2 are terrific, and Furious 7 is... Furious 7! it has some extreme/dumb things and yet is brainless fun). But he does pull out a lot more directorially out of a script that is at times convincing and dramatic, and other times is hackneyed revenge/sometimes cop drama.",/review/rw1725621/?ref_=tt_urv

","If anything is going to hurt this movie, it is going to be all of the negative reviews it has been receiving from all of these stuck up critics! Death Sentence is exactly what everyone is expecting it to be, and fans of the 'Revenge' genre will have a blast watching Kevin Bacon chase after his son's killers in this gruesome and riveting storyline.",/review/rw1725621/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2008,Arenarocker05,9," One Hell Of A Ride!
","Director James Wan has yet again made another successful film, only this time he focus's on an action perspective rather than a horror selection. The story centers on the life of Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon), a respectable father and husband whose life gets turned around when a vicious gang brutally murders his son. Now he is on the rampage and decides to take justice into his own hands, no matter what the circumstances hold before him.",/review/rw1725621/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2019,perica-43151,6," Straightforward revenge movie with lots of plot holes
","This is pretty run of the mill movie, that feels like a typical 90s production. Kevin Bacon is very solid, as he comes from sixth to the first degree with a lot of deserving pun ks. One sequence of organized and determined action towards the end is particularly inspired and/or inspiring, and John Goodman is very good, though his role is, like much of the movie, thin plot-wise. The movie falls rather flat and is quite formulaic with the setup, and you have to part with logic on one place too many along the way in the story. Still, a decent entertainment value that trumps the many annoying, intel ligence insu lting elements.",/review/rw1725621/?ref_=tt_urv

1 September 2007,damoviecritic,8," I don't agree with the critics on this one
","I usually agree with the mainstream critics about movies, for the most part. However, this movie, like the 1st Saw film, is a major exception. If you are looking for a best picture candidate, you will not find it here. However, it is a very entertaining, engrossing movie that will probably not appeal to the squeamish. The movie fits right into the Parent Revenge mold quite well. The oldest son is killed by gang. Dad avenges death. Gang fights back. Dad goes crazy and kills gang members, before the whole thing culminates in a final shootout full of graphic carnage. If you are looking for an insane action movie, this isn't quite it. In particular, the first half is very deliberate in trying to convey Bacon as a real guy, trying to avoid violence, but ultimately succumbing to it. I found this journey that he takes to be quite believe, up until a scene near the end in a hospital in which he turns into Rambo. Rather than being moving, it is slightly laughable. Then the movie turns into a straightforward, albeit very well shot, action flick full of gore and carnage. Many critics bashed the film for it's hypocrisy in having the movie condemn violence while later depicting it in stylish, perversely entertaining detail. However, I think this was justified by a gang leaders quote at near the end of the film. ""Look at you,"" he says to Bacon. ""You've turned into one of us."" The man is right. The gang leaders have slit throats and shot heads. But so has Bacon. He is a lesser of two evils to be sure, but an evil none the less. While this may be a cheap attempt by the director the make the film more serious, it does work. It is true that Bacon has transformed into a kind of monster. I give great credit to Bacon's performance, along with almost ever other actor. If a dark, violent, disturbing movie is what you are in the mood for this weekend, skip Halloween, and go see this.",/review/rw1725621/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2007,reeves2002,9," One of the best films i've seen this year!
","I loved it!One of the best films i've seen this year.It had everything you could want.It had drama,suspense,action,thrills and more.It was a fun and tense movie to watch.After the Hume family is introduced there is a tragic,senseless killing and the action starts and is non stop.It is typical of what is happening too often these days,where the criminal justice system is failing the victims of crime and favors the criminal who has all the rights.The movie was also emotional and moving and each family member grieved in their own way. It is the kind of movie where you strongly root for the father who is about to avenge his favorite son and initiates his own version of justice against a gang of skinhead looking thugs but with a colored member who grew up with the 2 Darley brothers.And even though some parts were over the top and not always believable,it keeps you on the edge of your seat with excitement.You fully understand this grieving father's wrath and what drove him to the edge.I wonder though(had it been real)if the father would have reacted so strongly if it were his youngest son who was killed instead of golden boy! Towards the end it got surprising and sad but I guess a necessary thing considering the war the father started.And then the story takes a very unexpected twist at the end but,but a satisfying way to end it.The whole movie was very well acted by everyone especially Kevin Bacon who did a lot of his own stunts.I think it was one of his best performances.",/review/rw1725621/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2007,xb4-1,10," Excellent!!!
","I know many people on here have posted that this film isn't based in reality and I for one am GLAD!!! We see reality too often day in and day out on the news, and the sad truth of it is, the bad guys usually get away with murder and don't suffer any repercussions for it. So it's great to see a film that delivers to us what it would be like if justice was served! Director, James Wan of the original ""SAW"" movie shows us he is not a one trick pony and can deliver his talents past just the horror genre. Kevin Bacon and the rest of the cast did a wonderful job delivering a very believable grief stricken family, I would definitely recommend this film!",/review/rw1725621/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2007,ejco215,9," Well Done!
",This movie surprised me. I expected something over acted and plot less. Boy was I wrong. This movie was really good. They show the reality of things that do happen. Kevin Bacon gave a good performance along with Kelly Preston. The Action was good. The violence was brutal and done in a realistic fashion. The language was also heavy and use in every sentence. The only problem with me is that the gang members were a little over done. I think they were kind of over the top including all the tattoos and what not. But besides that the movie was fun and intense.,/review/rw1725621/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2008,gradyharp,8," Revenge and other forms of Madness
","DEATH SENTENCE is a tough movie to watch, not because it is a poorly made film, but because of the degree of violence that, once started, is mayhem on a roller coaster ride. Though based on a novel by Brian Garfield, the script by Ian Jeffers is a patchwork quilt - the holes show whenever the police arrive on the scene. James Wan, of the 'Saw' movies fame, directs with a keen eye for breathless action sequences and almost intolerable suspense timing that makes the film fly through the 111 minutes of the Unrated version.",/review/rw1725621/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2008,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,7," Great thriller!
","James Wan (Saw) brings the ultra-violence to this gritty story of a suburban father (Kevin Bacon) who discovers the consequences of revenge after his son is murdered. The perpetrators of this senseless killing are a multi-ethnic (and highly visible) gang of drug dealers and cutthroats led by the psychotic Billy Darley (Garrett Hedlund); when the case is thrown out on a technicality, Bacon takes a page from Charles Bronson's book (no surprise, as this is based on author Brian Garfield's 1975 follow-up to Death Wish) and pursues a vigilante course to avenge his boy. Things do not go according to Bacon's plan, which cues a series of frantic and well-executed action set pieces, most notably a parking structure chase that unfolds in a nearly unbroken take. Death Sentence breaks no new ground in the action-thriller department, and its characters and dialog are nearly indistinguishable from any violent crime movie of the last few decades (in its weakest moments, it resembles grind house fare like The Exterminator); however, Bacon is excellent (as always) as the mild-mannered architect who discovers his inner killer the hard way, and Wan's knack for screen mayhem and unsettling atmosphere are well used here. The DVD includes both the theatrical version and an unrated cut (which offers 10 additional minutes), as well as two making-of features that originally aired on the Fox Movie Channel, and several websites that focus on director Wan, his cast, and the film's elaborate stunts and fight scenes.",/review/rw1725621/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2007,oak-,," ""Death Wish"" brought to the 21st century.
","No logic but lots of action, violence, gunfights and gore in this one. There is very little meat on the story-bone and in times where, thanks to TV, everyone is an expert on police procedures the lack of logic is almost appalling. But throw the CSI-knowledge over board and you're in for a crazy and entertaining ride. Nicely shoot with some great camera movement Wan is shooting stuff to pieces almost like Hong Kong directors did in the early '90s. No marksmen here, but who cares, this is pure pleasure for the eyes. Kevin Bacon delivers nicely and adds a whole new facet to the dad-on-a-rampage character. There's even a little ""Taxi Driver"" in him  and not only because of his gun and hairstyle.",/review/rw1725621/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2007,james1844,6," Gee! What Could Have Been
","I'm going to be the exception to the flow of ""thumbs up"" fans of this K. Bacon movie. This film is good in so many ways: Acting, cinematography, and raw realism ...BUT... It loses its' base and frustrates the movie-goer when it lacks reasonable logic and believability in several scenes. First, Bacon decides to get revenge with little preparation. Second, he goes from a bundled up neurotic basket-case white collar worker and then becomes ""Jason Bourne."" Third, if that isn't enough, the bad guy thugs shoot him and obviously everyone in the theater can see he's only winged and ""they"" leave him while exiting the house with nary a cop in sight while a patrol car sits out front with two murdered officers leaning on a horn blaring away. Where are the back-up? Then good 'ol Kevin escapes the hospital with great ease not to mention heading back to his house and several other places to prepare for his assault on the bad boys lair. This is only a smidgen of several ""beyond belief"" scenarios that just frustrated the heck out of me. Notice that I gave the film 6 stars and thats because it was a masterpiece in so many ways. What must be also said is that, had this film brought together the realism to the high caliber of all the things that did work then this could have been one heck of a film. Lastly, I felt betrayed by the ending that left questions unanswered.",/review/rw1725621/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2007,PWNYCNY,1," Popeye vs. Bluto 2007 or look out for the messenger!
","This movie is a modern version of Popeye vs. Bluto, you know, the cartoon characters who are always fighting, with Popeye getting the worst of it until he eats his spinach and then he's indestructible. Well, in this movie Kevin Bacon is the Popeye character and the other actor, who plays the bad guy, is the the Bluto character. This movie is so absurd, simplistic and two-dimensional that it makes Spongebob Squarepants seem like Hamlet. The violence is not only gratuitous, it occurs in situations that would attract so much public attention that it would probably make national news. A gang going berserk in the middle of the day in the middle of large city? That would definitely attract attention. However, this movie seems to suggest that pandemonium can occur without anybody, including the police, taking any notice. A businessman is publicly threatened by a criminal posing as a messenger? That would definitely prompt an immediate and thorough investigation, not only by the police but by the company itself. As for John Goodman, his presence as some kind of underground gun toting pseudo gangster, pseudo gun runner, pseudo estranged father is one of the most flagrant examples of muddled miscasting in recent memory, and that's saying a lot for an industry where miscasting is practically the norm. Hollywood, please ... PLEASE ... get real, come back to earth, make movies with actual stories, with good acting and with artistic quality. It has been done, it CAN be done, and hopefully it will be done. If not, then there's always Popeye the Sailor and his pal Bluto.",/review/rw1725621/?ref_=tt_urv

","if you are looking for a movie which has plenty of violence mixed with a bit of gore then look no further. i'm told the novel on which this movie is based is the sequel to the classic revenge thriller death wish released in the 70's & starring Charles Bronson. if like me, you enjoyed that movie then you will love this. kevin bacon stars & is outstanding as always & is always better when he is playing a psycho!!. the rest of the cast support very well with john goodman doing an unfamiliar turn as the bad guys' dad & very good he is too! also garret hedlund who plays billy is very powerful as the movies main nutcase. all of the other bad guys could have been taken from real gangs as they are so nasty. anyway this is a good Friday night film to see with your girl or your mates and the soundtrack is haunting especially the song at the end scene. the subject matter is quite harrowing but it is very satisfying watching a mild mannered man transform into the vigilante we would all like to become after the events put before him in this movie. all in all a top film directed by one of Hollywood's most promising new directors James wan who is not afraid to push the gore & explicit violence to the limit.",/review/rw1725621/?ref_=tt_urv
