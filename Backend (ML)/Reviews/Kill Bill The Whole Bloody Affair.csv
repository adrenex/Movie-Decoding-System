11 September 2019,UniqueParticle,9," I love this movie a lot being a guy with ASD!
","Johnny Knoxville and Brian Cox are spectacular! Hilarious while being entirely calming and at the same time quite awkward. I've known a lot of unique beings and been through a lot so I have a lot of sympathy for people that are different. Also this is my 480th review which I am very proud of, my passion is films and to be famous so maybe someone important could see my opinions. I don't know if someone quirky can even gain success especially since I am 27 but I still have high faith.",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2007,ccthemovieman-1,9," Underneath, This Has A Sweet Tone To It
","A typical modern-day comedy so some of its crudeness with sexual innuendos or remarks, but overall this is a full notch or two above most because underneath it is a soft, good- hearted feel to it. It's also a nice vehicle for a positive image to be presented for mentally- challenged people (formerl called ""retards""). Those guys are as much of stars in this film as actors Johnny Knoxville and Katherine Heigl. ",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2006,ScottDMenzel,8," Wow this movie is really underrated!
","A long time ago when I first saw the trailer for ""The Ringer"" my reaction to it was what the hell? Why would someone make a whole movie based on a ""South Park"" episode? Then the trailer for ""The Ringer"" disappeared for a while and then resurfaced completely re-edited. The new trailer for the film didn't really increase my interest in the film but out of curiosity (and the fact there really isn't much out I haven't seen) I decided to give the movie a chance and did so this afternoon.",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2007,cosmorados,8," what a shame for those who didn't get it
","I like many people saw the trailer for this film and instantly felt angry at the Farrelly's for crossing the line and taking the rip out of the disabled, after seeing it the only person having the rip taken out of him was johnny Knoxville who is brilliantly cast as the stooge of his addicted gambler uncle, Brian Cox.",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2008,jotix100,7," A day at the races
","We watched this film with trepidation. The Farrelly brothers don't actually believe in subtlety. ""The Ringer"" has a cast of mentally challenged players; frankly one feared the worst. Well, as it turned out, this is not your typical movie by the masters of grossness. The direction was entrusted to Barry Blaustein and the writing to Ricky Blitt. While there is some grossness, as was perhaps expected, the makers are actually quite respectful of the people involved in the Special Olympics.",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2008,dbborroughs,6," Way better then you think it is
",Johnnie Knoxville tries to fix the Special Olympics by pretending to be handicapped. The idea is that he'll pretend to be mentally handicapped so money can be won to help a friend with no insurance and his dad who's in debt to the mob.,/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2005,margielord,," This Movie Is Great For Special Olympic Athletes!
","As Head of Delegation for a Special Olympic Texas team who has athletes featured in this movie, I have to take exception with the concept of assuming the athletes are being teased and made fun of in this movie. I spent most of 3 months on the set watching the filming 2 years ago and I know how very carefully Special Olympics International has watched the development of this movie. They have been involved in every aspect of this movie, from script development to final product. I also know how very careful Special Olympics is with putting their seal of approval on projects. They simply do not endorse ANYTHING, yet they are completely and 100% behind this movie.",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2005,elf_107,9," This movie has so much heart!
","I got 2 free passes to see this film... I had very low expectations since it starred Johnny Knoxville who I, until today, only associated with really grotesque behavior on Jackass. The combination of that and Special Olympics smelled like it could be a cheap joke at the expense of Special Olympians but in fact it turned out to be just the opposite! It totally surpassed my expectations! It was a truly sweet, laugh out loud funny feel-good movie with big big heart. It portrayed the Olympians in a really caring way and those characters totally made the movie. I didn't have any trouble swallowing Johnny as a naive guy with a big heart, but people who've seen him in Jackass might find the contrast startling at first. It might be too sweet, or too predictably Hollywood for some people... But the physical comedy and naive sweetness really won me over in the end. I look forward to watching this film again.",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2009,insomniac_rod,7," Decent underrated black comedy.
","I really didn't expect much from this movie because to be honest, I didn't her about it until a few weeks ago.",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2013,chickswim,10," All Athletes should see this
","I am a Special Olympics athlete in Indiana and love this movie. It's the only movie that was cleared to go from Special Olympics Inc. Unlike ""Tropic Thunder"" which made fun of blacks and though with disabilities. I rented it from the library, which I would not pay to see at all. In one scene they used the r-word 10 to 15 times. It's ""respect"" not ""retarded"". I and others might be slower than you. But that only means others need to change their way of thinking around with intellectual disabilities. Those are real athletes playing in the movie too. For those like me it takes real guts to even do something like this. If I had the chance to I would take it. I want to write a book about those like us someday. I have been writing poems, though. Thank You.",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2005,asam3122,10," ""When did we get ice cream?""
","""The Ringer"" is the story of Steve Barker, who, one day, is sent to fire his friend, the janitor, Stavi. When Stavi explains that he has five kids and that his wife died, Steve decides not to fire him, and to give him a job at his apartment complex mowing the lawn. When the mower malfunctions, Stavi loses some fingers. The surgery to give him his fingers back costs 28,000 dollars. Steve doesn't have that kind of money, and there's no way he can get it on time.",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2009,vampyrecowboy,8," A great supporting cast
","While I liked the movie, I liked the story and the cast...it was the supporting cast that was better than the lead Johnny Knoxville.",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2006,mayofam-1,10," This Movie Is Terrific Fun With a Great Heart
","As the mom of a real Special Olympian, it is great to see S.O. treated as an integral part of a big picture like this. I am sorry other people did not enjoy it as much as I did. Having a special child is something most people think is a tragedy; we parents of Special Olympians know that in many ways it is a great gift. It does make many people uncomfortable as a topic, but this film handles all these issues beautifully and was made with the support and guidance of Special Olympics with real mentally challenged athletes in pivotal roles. NOT a ""heavy"" message film at all, just a comedy for everyone who loves to laugh, regardless of their abilities. Give it a chance and you will love it! A+",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2006,Sportscam20-1,9," ""The Ringer"", True Equality for All or a Step Backwards?
","What would you say if a person would try to enter the Special Olympics and make people think he was actually Developmentally Disabled? Horrible Right? Well, this is what happens in the new film ""The Ringer."" Steve Barker (Johnny Knoxville) is an average office worker looking for some new challenges to his job. Barker must fire a janitor of long-time status to the company, but he feels sorry for him and rehires him for a new job. In the process the janitor, Stavi, is hurt and must be taken to the hospital. Now Steve Barker must find a way to earn a huge sum of money in one week! Gary (Brian Cox), Steve's uncle, tells him that he should ""rig the Special Olympics"" by pretending to be a Special Olympics athlete.",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2021,rhino-94279,9," Vastly underrated. Hilarious with lots of heart
",Not much to say except watch it. Hilarious and heart warming. It would do everyone good to watch this movie once.,/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2006,Sprstrddawg,10," A Really Great Movie
","The Ringer, a story about a man who rigs the Special Olympics to gain money for him and his uncle, is a surprisingly good movie. Reading the premise and seeing the commercials for this movie probably won't give you much reason to see it. It comes across as an insensitive, politically incorrect film that degrades mentally challenged people and pokes fun at the Special Olymics when it is actually not like that at all. There is a great message behind the film. Johnny Knoxville as Jeffy is great, not the insensitive jerk he may seem to be from Jackass. Brian Cox plays a great Uncle Gary, and Katherine Heigl is wonderfully sweet as Lynn. Besides a little language, this is a film for all ages. This New Year, check out The Ringer if you want a laugh and a heartwarming story.",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2021,IonicBreezeMachine,7," Takes a premise that could've backfired, but masterfully uses it for humor and heart.
","Steve Barker (Johnny Knoxville) hates his job but after over two years of working, receives a promotion. His first duty is to fire his friend Stavi (Luis √Åvalos), who is the janitor. Steve reluctantly does so, but hires him to work around his apartment. Stavi gets three fingers cut off in a lawn-mower accident, and reveals that he does not have health insurance. Steve must raise $28,000 within a few weeks to pay for the surgery to re-attach his friend's fingers. His sleazy uncle Gary (Brian Cox), owes $40,000 in gambling debts and suggests that they fix the Special Olympics in in order to solve both of their financial problems. Steve, who competed in track and field in high school as well as having acted in the drama club, reluctantly enters the Special Olympics in the guise of a high functioning young man with a developmental disability named Jeffy.",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2008,shadowguy12,7," A good movie
","This movie was good, and definitely good enough to get by. I'll simplify the basic plot: a man needs to make some money and so joins the special Olympics and eventually tries to go out with one of the trainers.",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2006,klchamp,10," Give this movie a chance!!!
","When thinking about the Special Olympics, you normally would not think of comedy. Yet the Farrelly Bros. strike again. A goof-ball with a heart of gold is helped by a group of S.O. athletes, only to overcome odds, help a friend get his fingers back, and open himself up to vulnerability and attacks. Excellent performances by Knoxville, Heigl, and especially Jed Rees and Bill Chott for their unforgettable performances as Glen and Thomas (both from Galaxy Quest) . ANYONE who thought this movie to be politically incorrect...don't knock it until you have seen it! They hired mentally challenged performers for various roles, and rather than be the butt of the jokes, they are the ones making those jokes. WATCH THIS MOVIE AND ENJOY IT FOR WHAT IT IS...a good film, an excellent cast, and the brand of comedy one can only expect from the Farrelly Bros. Have fun and laugh!!!",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2010,neil3styleuk,7," all round funny and goof comedy
","people who think this is a small minded movie and offensive need to get a life. This movie does not poke fun at disabilities, in fact it applauds those with special needs, the only character to be made to look stupid here is johnny Knoxville's character.",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2005,pamela-98,9," I saw The Ringer last night
","There are so many people who have a difficult time with the holiday season, and I guess I'm one of them. I was able to take my family to see The Ringer last night and I'm SO glad I did. I had reservations, once the movie started. I knew very little about it, and, certainly was not aware of the Special Olympics endorsement. I wasn't sure how they were going to portray the special people. However, as the characters were developed, this movie became so heartwarming and genuine that I left with tears because it blessed me so. Maybe I'm the one who is screwed up, and I'm certainly no professional when dealing with handicaps, but I am a substitute teacher and have often been blessed to be assigned to the special needs classes, so I have been around many special students. I loved this movie. It helped me to get some issues of my own in perspective and gave my whole family a real feel-good experience. I have read the comments of others, and it appears to me, the people who were most critical hadn't even seen the film.",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2006,chirdon,9," Surprisingly Excellent - Surpassed Expectations
",I heard of this movie when it first came out. I figured on seeing a jackass-ian treatment of the mentally challenged and avoided it like the plague - I shouldn't have.,/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2005,pamela2406-1,8," Great Movie
","The Special Olympics gave their blessings to the makers of this movie. I saw it at a special preview. I was worried that the movie was based on making fun of handicapped individuals, it was not. I was impressed by this movie. It shows the behind the scenes of the Special Olympics and the people that help. I spoke with a few people after the movie and asked what they thought and 60% of them mentioned that they personally would like to help out at the next Special Olympics. They said they never knew what it was like to be around special people and were sometimes scared. But seeing this movie made them understand how some of them are and it made them want to help. Most of the jokes were directed towards the Jeffy character played by Johnny Knoxville. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It was a good movie.",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2006,killergoomba,10," Edgy Material pulled off in the finest form.
","Johnny Knoxville? Special Olympics? When I first saw the movie poster to 'The Ringer', I was thinking ""tasteless""? But when I found out that the movie had the approval of the Special Olympics itself, I decided to see this movie. I like Johnny Knoxville. I think he is funny, even though he has been quite the Jackass. 'Dukes Of Hazzard' was a hoot... 'Walking Tall' was another good Knoxville flick. 'The Ringer' is perhaps his finest. I have to say that, I don't think that anyone who left the theatre tonight went away without learning something. Johnny Knoxville? The Special Olympics? Who else could have pulled this one off? Carrey? Ferell? Stiller? Nope. Knoxville. Well Done!",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2006,simon_ham,9," Could have blown up in his face!! Fortunately didn't!!
","I bought it on box office in the face of stiff competition- Date Movie no less - and expected a poor taste, cheap comedy, right up my street. My partner however, was a little concerned about this prognosis. As a former carer to young disabled people she can be more sensitive about it than I. As I hoped, the film scored full marks for funnies. But not in the form of cheap jibes at disabled people. There was some clever writing (not genius but sharp), Johnny Knoxville had some cracking lines, the accusation directed at the leading ladies boyfriend of 'he poked me in the chest and called me stupid'(sic) was a cracker. Don't watch it if you're a bleeding heart liberal who can see the wrong in everything. If that's you you'll miss the stunning performance put on by all the competitors of the Special Olympics. Don't anyone say this film is in poor taste. If you say that you're belittling the efforts, and successes, of all the cast, in what's a dicey subject. Watch it. Don't expect 'The Godfather' or 'High Fidelity' with regards depth, nor 'Dumb & Dumber' for cult status, just a nice film you can watch with your girlfriend. There's something for everyone.",/review/rw1494386/?ref_=tt_urv
