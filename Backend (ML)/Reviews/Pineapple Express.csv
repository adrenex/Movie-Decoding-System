20 October 2018,paul-allaer,9," Death-defying feat will leave you stunned
","""Free Solo"" (2018 release; 96 min.) is a bio-pick about Alex Honnold and his historic 2017 climb of Yosemite's El Capitan. As the movie open, we see Alex in the later stage of that climb, and the images immediately will cause you to gasp. We then go back to ""Spring 2016"", when Alex is doing a book tour and comments about why he does what he does. ""Chances of falling off are low, but the consequences are high"", he wryly observes. Ater a few minutes recapping Alex's upbringing, it isn't long before the movie centers on El Capitan, ""the center of the rock-climbing universe""... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw4758520/?ref_=tt_urv

18 October 2018,doron-87394,10," Powerful Inspiration
","No, I'm not inspired to free climb El Capitan or any slope. I'm an 84 year old retired businessman still trying to figure out how to best live my life, and I left the theater last night in awe of Alex Honnald's achievement -- climbing an almost vertical granite wall in a little over three hours when, in any second, the slightest mistake would result in death.",/review/rw4758520/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2019,deloudelouvain,10," Even better than The Dawn Wall
","After watching The Dawn Wall (2017) with free climber Tommy Caldwell and his climbing partner Kevin Jorgeson I wondered if I was up to watch another climbing documentary about the same rock. This time it's about Alex Honnold, the first person to ever free solo climb El Capitan, and to be fair I liked this story even more. I'm in awe for people surpassing their limits by trying things that seem impossible to us simple mortals but I'm also in awe about people that are adrenaline junkies and that are prepared to do the most stupid things. Things that are deadly with just one false movement. I will never get why people need to do that but I like to watch them do it and achieve their goal. I think Alex Honnold is an exceptional athlete with a fabulous mental attitude, but also think that he's silently depressed and didn't find it's true purpose to live for. His girlfriend must love him very much but I doubt he loves her the same way. The documentary is well shot, with interesting interviews, gripping moments where you will sit at the edge of your seat. Big respect for what he accomplished even though I will never get why people do such crazy pointless things.",/review/rw4758520/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2018,mtlott,10," Great bio-pic / climbing movie
","I've wanted to see this film since I first heard it was being made. Reading about the soloing of El Cap in the summer of 2017, I was riveted. The film is just as, if not more, powerful than the best articles at the time.",/review/rw4758520/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2019,CineMuseFilms,8," More about masculine emotional maturity than free solo climbing
","A documentary about climbing solo up sheer vertical cliffs without safety ropes sounds too crazy-masculine to contain a gentle story of emotional awakening. While Free Solo (2018) celebrates athletic triumph it is also a thoughtful essay on mortality, fear, and self-identity, as it probes into the heart and mind of an elite athlete in an extreme sport.",/review/rw4758520/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2018,jordanparton,10," The most amazing Human achievement I've ever witnessed
","This movie shows the humanity, insanity, and personal struggle for perfection it takes to do things that no one else has done and few to none have tried to accomplish. Possible the best movie I have ever seen in terms of drawing you in, keeping a strangle hold on your attention, and not just rushing to the juicy parts but letting you savor the journey.

12 November 2018,johnfkitchen,10," A masterpiece by directors Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi
","You had me at ""Jimmy Chin"", and ""El Cap"", so I checked out the trailer, and it looked pretty good. However I was unprepared for the reality. Trailers so often pick out some highlights and leave an expectation which is left unfulfilled.",/review/rw4758520/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2019,cricketbat,8," My palms haven't stopped sweating yet
","I don't think my palms have stopped sweating since watching Free Solo. This documentary is beautifully shot and told in a way that keeps you hanging on every moment. Professional rock climber Alex Honnold is definitely insane, and yet you have to admire his strength and determination. I have no desire to climb El Capitan, nor do I think anyone else should try climbing it free solo, but I'm glad I got to experience it by proxy safely from the comfort of my couch.",/review/rw4758520/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2019,peter-61849,10," The highest accomplishment of mankind ever
","Having been a climber for over 30 years, I can entirely understand and appreciate what's going on inside of the spirit. Having gone up El Cap myself, I can entirely feel the enormity of this endeavor shown in this film.
However, I know how hard it is to climb at a 5.12 level, let alone a 5.13. Even a 5.11 goes beyond the imagination of most human beings on this planet. And I'm still talking ""being roped up and safe"".
Now accepting the thought of free soloing anything at 5.11 and above, even for just a hundred feet, chapeau to those who have the mental strength and physical preparedness to do so.
However, what Honnold did, free soloing at up to 5.13 and on over 3000 feet of rock, goes beyond comprehension.
Also, I'd like to share my entire appreciation to the film crew, as I'm entirely aware of the logistical challenges one has to manage to capture something like this film has shown us.
Having friends on the wall, who met them on the wall, I also know that the film crew and Honnold had to go up the wall several times again. Truly incredible, the dedication they all put into this, I just can't find words to describe.
It's hard to say if this will ever be done again.
For sure I can say that this is the highest ever accomplishment in sports of mankind ever and I'm so thankful that this documentary has been able to share it with us.",/review/rw4758520/?ref_=tt_urv

4 October 2018,gnelson36,10," Does not disappoint - and I was expecting a lot
","Coincidentally, our family did a hiking vacation in Yosemite a week after Alex Honnald did this climb. I knew nothing about climbing but our guided hike took us to the top of El Capitan. I was unable or unwilling to get within 100 yards of the edge - since at 101 yards there was a 3000 foot cliff.",/review/rw4758520/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2019,solemnphilosopher,7," Slow to Climax

4 March 2019,robfollower,9," One incredible climb for one athlete, one quantum leap for mankind.
","Free Solo Takes Documentary to New Heights. National Geographic highest grossing documentary, Free Solo, merges absolutely breathtaking IMAX views of American rock climber, Alex Honnold, from high atop cliffs of mountain ranges around the planet along with a deep look into what makes this adventurist continue his relentless eight-year pursuit to attain perfection. If you are afraid of heights, this film allows you to take nail biting mountain cliff climbs from the comfort of your own couch. Will Alex fall to his death as he climbs the face of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park without any safety ropes, using just his bare hands? No one has free climbed El Capitan till now. One mistake and you are dead. Over forty of Alex's fellow free soloists have already died. Will he be next?",/review/rw4758520/?ref_=tt_urv

16 March 2019,umimelectric,6," Not sure if stupid or incredible
","Though I much prefer the documentary The Dawn Wall, this death defying climb doc is very exciting in its final moments. It's truly an amazing feat done by a suicidal, misanthropic athlete who prefers not to use safety gear. I didn't care for most of the documentary, because I don't find Alex to be a very sympathetic character, and I also think it focused too much on his dating life. He is who he is, and I respect that, but watching him share his opinions on love, relationships with others, and the importance of life in general was underwhelming to say the least. Whether he was putting on a bad boy show for the camera, or he really is this detached emotionally, his stubborn world view made him unlikable (to me at least). The results speak for themselves, and what he did was nothing short of incredible (-ly stupid).",/review/rw4758520/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2021,kosmasp,9," No strings attached
","Also no pun intended - well maybe a little pun intended. Who am I fooling right? But that line really throws itself at someone ... it really easily falls from ... alright, enough of those puns then. We have quite the inspiring story but also a very human one. Almost in every aspect of the movie the people involved and included do not feel ""fake"". It never really feels like they change who they are just to please the camera (sometimes even vocalizing that, like when our main man says that it would be best if he'd cry, but he just doesn't want to).",/review/rw4758520/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2019,OneAnjel,7," can we get a redo without the needy girlfriend
","Alex is a fascinating person with a fascinating skill. I wanted to be mesmerized with a film that takes us sort of into his mind and actually catches death defying moments on film. Instead, I feel I am waiting for the girlfriend to please stop talking. I mean, first of all she meets him at a book signing and then tries to get him to stop climbing. In shrink jargon that looks something like ""Oh you LOVE climbing, well my ego will make you love ME more if it's the last thing I do."" And she is in more than 40% of the film, it feels like, with an unpleasant high whiny voice, the kind that people laugh at in sit coms when they want us to feel sorry for the guy.
I really feel the film itself asks that we decline to even like the girlfriend, who essentially tries to kill him twice -- causing his first ever injury, at which point Alex admits he thought about dumping her immediately.
She is clearly unhappy with who Alex actually is (she wants him to feel more, talk more, climb less). I mean, the audience is on board: let her go, man. She is trouble with a capital T.
Then he buys her a house. Hmm. I feel like turning the film off. Can we PLEASE get to some climbing sometime and hear the thoughts of the guy who we are all actually here to watch? Thanks.
Finally, the heart palpitating climb takes place. We get to see a lot of breath stopping moments and amazing views of the huge landscape swallowing up this small (relatively) man. But in many ways it is disappointing. The film spends over 100 minutes leading us to this life-changing -- no -- WORLD changing event, and then spends less than 15 minutes on the actual 3+ hr climb. What the audience is left with are small bits of the journey -- a hand hold here, a foothold there, a leg swing, and finally as his momentous victory flows through the atmosphere like poetry and we try to imagine his savoring these moments.... his phone rings. Yes, the high pitched ego maniac can not let Alex have this moment, she must consume him here, as well.
Alex, thank you for allowing us to watch you. Please hire a crew to re-compose the film with more you, less immature, self centered girlfriend.",/review/rw4758520/?ref_=tt_urv

2 July 2019,garethcrook,10," Masterful at every turn.
","Straight off there's two things that struck me about this, the first is glaringly obvious, it's mind meltingly scary, not fake horror, jump scare scary, I mean real 'life' or absolute certain painful 'death' scary. Climbing 3000ft up a rock with NO ROPE. Alex Honnold is, well he's not nuts, quite the opposite, he's focused in a way that most of us just can't fathom. There's always something else in our lives that distract us, things we have to do, things we want to do. Alex doesn't have any of that. Alex has climbing. That. Is. It. The second is the way this doc is made, it's equally as focused. There is a little history, but it's kept to a minimum, this is purely about the task ahead. To attempt a free solo climb of El Capitan and everything that entails. Never done, because it's been thought impossible... or simply too dangerous. In his own words ""I know if I fall, my body will pretty much explode on impact"". There's some really nice stuff with the camera crew, showing how they captured this, why they did this, the process they had to follow and what it was like and it really helps to put this in context, it's really not just a film. The commonality that pulls all the threads together is predictably simple... risk. Death is a real prospect, even an inevitability and it's addressed head on, like a massive 'Do not try this at home' disclaimer. I've watched at least 50% of this shaking my head in disbelief, it's truly staggering. The sheer magnitude, learning every crevice, every inch, my heart rate went up and I was just sat on the sofa. The truth is Alex is cut off from most people's perception of reality. He's confident, strong, blasé to a point that he could be dismissed as crazy, but that's just us being lazy. The crew shooting are our eyes literally and figuratively, they're all seasoned climbers, but just as astonished at the attempt. ""We wanna film it well, but we don't wanna get in the way"". There are clear decisions taken as to which parts of the climb are to be shot and how... and which are, too dangerous, too distracting and too high a possibility of seeing him fall. There's painfully awkward scenes with Alex and his girlfriend, frank discussions about his approach to their life together, which essentially comes down to what's more important, their relationship or soloing... it's the climbing. He needs the perfection, not people, not emotion. There could be a full stop in the film's title. Alex is 'Free' when he's 'Solo'. ""Nobody ever did anything good because they're happy and cozy"". As a viewing experience this is anything but cozy, in fact I'd go as far to say as this is possibly some of the most intense footage in cinematic history. Not sure you're into climbing? Watch this. Not sure you like documentaries? Watch this. Afraid of heights? Watch this. Whatever you do, watch this!!",/review/rw4758520/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2019,Bjornek1,6," Enjoyable film with an unfulfilled potential
","I enjoyed watching this movie. The footage of free solo climbing gives adrenaline and sweaty hands. The glimpses into Alex' personality and relations with his family and girlfriend are interesting. And even more interesting are his reflections on life and death, that he has to consider when doing something so dangerous.",/review/rw4758520/?ref_=tt_urv
