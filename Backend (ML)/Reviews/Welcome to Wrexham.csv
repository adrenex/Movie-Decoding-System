27 August 2022,subxerogravity,6," Just makes me wish that Stallone was in a really good superhero movie
","Yeah, he played Judge Dredd and Demolition Man. He was in Guardians of the Galaxy and Rambo is a Bonafede hero, but Samaritan makes me feel like I wanted to see the Italian Stallion (not a bad superhero name at all) as Batman or Captain America, and I know what you're thinking but still, something like that, not necessarily that.",/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2022,bbosma-24403,7," Stallone gets to act his age and still be a credible tough guy.
","Didn't have high expectations, but this was a pretty good movie. The story, with Stallone as a retired super hero living anonymously in a dystopian near future, allows him to play his own age while still being a tough guy in a credible way. The idea works well for him and he is perfect for the part. The kid, who the story sort of revolves around, is also good, and I expect to see a lot more of Danish actor Asbaek (from Bergen and Game of Thrones) who is excellent as an almost sympathetic bad guy. Thankfully the director avoids the one thing I find so annoying about these kinds of movies - endless fight scenes.",/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2022,TxMike,," Good, entertaining vehicle for Stallone.
","Many of the movies I have enjoyed over the recent years are ones where a good guy is able to put the bad guys in their place. Such was ""Taken"" with Neeson, the series ""Reacher"" with Richeson. Here we have Stallone playing a guy who tries to be invisible, but is forced to spring into action when he sees wrong.",/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,craig-snell-151-149427,7," I don't get the hate
","Is this the best superhero movie ever made, hell no, is it the worst movie ever made, not by a long shot.",/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2022,Mehki_Girl,7," Enjoyable
",Watched this with hubby who wanted to see it (but I didn't) and we both enjoyed it.,/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2022,gareth-75442,5," Stallone was good but the movie is a letdown
","Really have no clue to the thinking behind movies like this, it's like watching a really bad live action cartoon, the awful clunky editing gives the impression that it was a last minute decision not to make it a mini-series but a TV movie instead.",/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2022,ryanmo-35178,8," What is good? what is bad?
","Finally watching a film with Stallone as a super hero. The film is about twins, while one is good (Samaritan) and the other is bad (Nemesis), they disappeared 25 years ago and everyone thought the good killed his brother and vanished. However, the boy was bullied by the bad guys, and Stallone the neighbor came out and punished them, and their friendship started. The bad guy came back and wanna kill him, and I found out his superpower (binary fusion!) where his cells can reproduce and thus he is not getting hurt! Through he need to lower his temperature and thus there is much ice-cream in the fridge! While the bad man (Cyprus) wanna simulate Nemesis and destroy the city and boy, Stallone then went and rescue him. During the fighting, everyone knows he is Nemesis instead of Samaritan! What a surprise! Anyway he knocked down the gangster and rescued the boy, and a happy ending....",/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2022,andrew-hill515,8," Solid enjoyable movie

28 August 2022,tsroque,8," Actually Surprised How Good this Was!
","I was actually surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. I have never been a huge Sylvester Stallone fan, but I like the raw, grittiness of this character. Reminded me of his Rocky days. I also find myself liking the movies he's been doing lately. They typically have a message and things get blown up and bad guy smashed to pieces. LOL! So, I guess I'm more of a fan than I thought, which is another surprise. This movie is violent but but enough to where you can not watch with your whole family. It is your typical good vs evil but with a small predictable twist. 'Wanna' did a great job and I enjoyed his acting and role in this movie too.",/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2022,trinaboice,7," I love the idea of Stallone as an aging superhero
","IN A NUTSHELL:
A young boy learns that a superhero who was thought to have gone missing after an epic battle twenty years ago may, in fact, still be alive.",/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2022,running_with_scissors,6," It would be easy if only bad people did bad things...
",You know this was so close to being a good movie.,/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2022,classicsoncall,7," ""Yeah. I just pick up garbage for a living. That's what I do.""
","Intrigued by the trailer, this looked like it could have been a real gritty and compelling story, but I think the film only partially delivered. It takes on a comic book air at the outset with a narrative of a super-hero attempting to save Granite City from a hostile nemesis named..., well, Nemesis. Both presumed dead now for twenty-five years, the city, and particularly one young boy, have reason to believe that the hero called Samaritan somehow survived a fiery death and will come out of the shadows to take on a new villain with a mission to shut down the city's electrical grid and return power to its citizens, which in this case refers to the low-life elements who would run amok and loot the city for all its worth.",/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2022,Maxax777,8," Pretty Solid!!!
",That was actually quite good - nothing wrong with that at all! Really enjoyed it - one of the best Stallone movies in awhile!!! Just overall a good fun movie - enjoyed it from start to finish!!! And that's all I really have to say about it - check it out it was pretty solid! No seriously - it was solid! Solider and pretty decent - totally enjoyed it! And apparently my review is still not long enough - we don't want to know if you enjoyed it or not apparently you'd like to read an entire novel about the movie!,/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2022,IndecentLouie,7," Enjoyable enough
","It's somewhat generic and highly predictable but it was still fun, kids between 10 and 16 are going to love it since it's very much aimed towards a younger audience but as an adult I found it fun enough
Stalone has got the grizzled aged man down to a Tee and it's wild how much in shape he still is.",/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2022,FeastMode,3," I continue to beg: rated R please!!!!
",Samaritan starts off with a really cool stylized opening scene that got me excited. The first act is mildly entertaining. You can feel the streaming-level quality but it's still enjoyable in one-time viewing kind of way.,/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2022,latinfineart,4," Stallone was the only good part of this film
","Like most movies based on a comic book this movie was really awful. It was particularly bad because it took itself too seriously, there was absolutely no humor and I'm saying that as a fan of Stallone. He just couldn't do anything to save this movie.",/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," Sly did his best with what he was given.
","In the oversaturated arena of superhero films, that last thing you want to see is a bland story riddled with plot and technical issues. Aside from Sly's amazing presence, even he couldn't save the cliched and underwhelming screenplay. Aside from one decent twist, the rest of the story was generic and predictable, and lacked that ""superhero intensity"" in its writing. There wasn't enough substance in the story to merit the 102 min runtime, and the slow pacing didn't help much either. The directing wasn't any better with the long dragged out scenes, and the constant 360-degree spins everyone did when they got punched. I mean what's up with that nonsense anyway, was the action choreographer a gymnast? It's an ok one-time watch, especially if you're a Sly fan.",/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2022,Cinema-reviewer321,6," A hero vanishes and reappears
","This movie had a good plot and Sylvester Stallone was good in the movie, I just think they could have used the idea more than what they did. There is a twist I will not spoil but it surprised me.",/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2022,kevdexxx,7," Decent and watchable Sci-fi fantasy
","I have no idea of the origins of the characters in the film, but being a Stallone fan I had to give it a watch. A great and stylish beginning leads to a decent and well paced story, with good supporting acting backing up Stallone and his usual grunty and menacing style (nothing wrong with that if you are a fan). The storyline is predictable of course, at least to a point, but that doesn't make it boring to watch, with some nice touches here and there and a few moral lessons thrown in for good measure. There are some good set pieces too, and a good ending. Overall then, worth a watch if you are a fan of sci-fi/superhero/anti-hero films and don't mind Slys ""acting"".",/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2022,veinctor,3," Bad.
","You never get to understand what is the motivation of anyone in the movie. The intro is a narration instead of showing action and showing anyone's superpowers. You don't know what the hero's superpowers and limits really are, therefore there are no stakes. Cliche overconfident (without a reason) villain that talks too much but doesn't really have a reason to do any of the bad things he does. They even set up things that never pay of. Characters exist for no good reason.",/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv

",Fun.,/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2022,Blake-Brandenburg,9," Hate all you want.
",Sly knocked it out of the park and not just acting. He brought an early 90's feel and look to this movie and only people who grew up through the 80's and 90's are going to really appreciate the details that went into that.,/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2022,djreeser,8," So refreshing after all Marvel copy/paste prod.
","I really enjoyed watching this movie and as I said in the title, It was really refreshing to see something different than crappy marvel productions. Maybe because this hero movie has kind of oldschool 90's movies felling, and it's not just because of Sly
(respect for that man!). I wasn't bored even for a second when watching it. Really recommend to check it out if you are one of this people who stopped watching Marvel's productions some time ago. Simple story, great acting, some really nice shots. Even one fight scene where is no cuts, just one longer shoot which I really like. Of course Samaritan has some minuses like for example some CGI scenes or explanation wherefrom they got explosives of - they could come up with something better! Still great movie, worth over 100 minutes of my life.",/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2022,jpapanone,," Myyyyyyyy goooooooodnessssss gracious

29 August 2022,Luv2Spooge,4," Boring Afterschool Special
","Not really sure what I just watched. It's like a movie length ""Afterschool Special,"" if you're old enough to understand. You know, a moral lesson on platitudes of right and wrong. That's actually a ""plus,"" but it just made this so boring to watch unless you're like 10 or something.",/review/rw8496859/?ref_=tt_urv
