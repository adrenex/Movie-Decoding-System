28 November 2018,CubsandCulture,1," On the short list of films I have walked out of...
","I had gone to see this film in the hopes that at worst it would be so bad it's good. Unfortunately, it careened past that point about 15 minutes in to it's so bad it's obnoxious. I managed to suffer through about 2/3rds of it before throwing in the towel. I saw nothing in that time that made me want to ever finish the movie.",/review/rw4889799/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2018,roberteburne,1," Primark clothed, badly staged, legend wrecking, stinker
","Went to see this today... and it was really bad. A real stinker. They have just 5 sets. The town, the church, a kind of bow and arrow Iraq war, the mine with random flares (what are they mining?) and a place for doing speeches to the peasants. The costume department clearly raided primark and you keep thinking how did a man with one hand get handcuffed twice in this film? And when are Blake's 7 going to turn up to ask for their footwear back. There is a scene with dialogue from most English speaking accents... Irish, Cockney, American, Australian but none of this is meant to be funny. The best bits are the super unrealistic close combat bow and arrow shooting... and then end after the excruciatingly bad ""false ending"". Help.",/review/rw4889799/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2018,valarik564,1," I wanted to like it. I couldn't manage it.
","If anyone reads this, it's likely because you're either reading a bunch of reviews because you can't decide if a ticket is worth it, or you hated it and are reading all the 1 star reviews so you can say ""thank you"" multiple times when you read a criticism you agree with. If you're the latter, welcome, you're among friends. If you're the former, I'm not going to tell you that you shouldn't see or love this movie, clearly some people do, I'm just going to lay out why I can't.",/review/rw4889799/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2018,confidential-67897,3," Could have been a good movie
","The main problems are the following
The actors who played maid Marion, fryer tuck and will Scarlett just can't act. The set's look like the Roman Empire and not 10th century England, and the clothing looks like it's just come off a Prada rack. I was expecting someone to pull out an iPhone at one point. It would have been ok if it was filmed as a comedy, but it wasn't.",/review/rw4889799/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2018,marijn-vandriest,1," How to ruin the image of a great story/ jamie why
",There are loads of Robin hood series and movies. This is the nr 1 for being the worst. When historical movies got political correct elements I always get a little bit cynical. I hoped that a great actor like Jamie fox could take that feeling away. This movie was really really bad. It 's Not only the political correctness the rest of the movie is even worse. In the usa this might be great but for europeanss this is is offensieve. The crusades where. Not africans.,/review/rw4889799/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2018,eeluksw,2," Braindead
","Reminds me of last year's re-imagining of King Arthur except a heist film this is not. Robin Hood gets his umpteenth retelling yet the film insists it's telling a new version of the story while also basically covering all you already know about the man himself. Steal from the rich, give to the poor; it's not complicated, and open to a million different interpretations of that core loop, yet here we are.",/review/rw4889799/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2018,eddie_baggins,4," Another misguided big-screen Robin Hood
","We arguably didn't need yet another cinematic reimaging of the age old tale of Robin Hood and his merry band of followers, robbing from the rich and giving to the poor, but after the last big screen treatment faired so poorly in the form of the Russell Crowe/Ridley Scott version in 2010, I for one was totally up for another stab at the classic tale, aware that the material still has the potential to entertain now just as well as it first did many moons ago.",/review/rw4889799/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2018,drjgardner,3," Watch the Classic
","Some films are so good they require that any re-make be superb. The Errol Flynn version of Robin Hood has stood the test of time, and with the possible exception of Robin and Marion, no other film has come close. So too with this re-imagining of the story which takes some unnecessary and unwanted liberties, not to mention the coal mines which weren't in existence at the time of the story. The film has little to recommend it. Go back and watch the original.",/review/rw4889799/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2018,amazon-39490,3," Why?
",It takes a lot for me to leave the cinema but this film achieved it. From the over the top bow and arrow fights that feel like something out of black hawk down to the bizarre mix of costumes it's just all wrong. I'm really not sure who thought 100 million budget was well spent making this steaming heap of a film.,/review/rw4889799/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm in a weird situation here. It is currently the night before this movie's release, 11/20. However, I was lucky enough to watch this yesterday night, 11/19. The reviewing embargo was still up when I got home, and was up this afternoon as well. This is the earliest I can alert the public about what I saw.",/review/rw4889799/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2018,obiegimmie,2," ""Robin Hood"": A Joyless Spectacle of Action and Cliche
","Quite possibly the greatest rendition of the classic ""Robin Hood"" story is the 1938 ""Adventures of Robin Hood,"" starring Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. The film begins with an initiative, and uses its protagonists to advance the plot methodically. Perhaps most importantly lies the film's self awareness; its delight in relishing a sense of refreshing fun and delight. The classic tale of Robin Hood has always been one best told briskly and with a sense of humor.",/review/rw4889799/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2018,TheLittleSongbird,3," The un-entertaining and un-thrilling story of Robin Hood
","Am a fan of the character of Robin Hood and his adventures, such colourful characters (not just Robin) and stories high in entertainment value and intrigue. Film adaptations have varied, most good, with the definitive version being easily the 1938 Errol Flynn film, a personal favourite of mine. So there was a lot of potential for this version, on top of it having an interesting film and wanting to see as many 2018 films as possible.",/review/rw4889799/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2018,admcdonough,1," I Was Warned
","I try to see every new film that comes out in the theaters. I have a theater only about a mile from my house so I go to see many films there to the point where the theater staff knows me (they don't get everything and sometimes I want to go elsewhere just for an IMAX version of a film, but I see over half of the films I go to there). They asked me what I was seeing and I could tell by their reaction they didn't think I was going to have a good experience. One of them said ""I saw it last night and it wasn't that great"" (they have free screenings for the staff). I knew this meant it had been horrid. I said ""well I like most everything at least a bit"" (I do) and went in. The film was worse than I imagined it could be and it indeed turned out to be one of those rare films I didn't like at all. What was wrong? Basically everything. The plot was just unbelievably bad, the costumes were bizarre, and the acting was, well I don't even think calling it acting was appropriate. What in the world was going on and why was Jamie Foxx's character even in it (I'm sure his reason for being in the film was along the line's of Michael Caine's for being in Jaws: The Revenge, the house he bought with the paycheck was really nice). Taron Egerton has to do a better job of selecting his roles. As bad as Billionaire Boys Club was, this makes that seem like Citizen Kane. As for the positives (to show I'm fair), Eve Hewson is very pretty and there were a lot of action scenes even if they were shot so poorly as to remind me of chickens running around with their heads cut off. Really wretched.",/review/rw4889799/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2018,stuartpbottomley,1," Avoid this one at all cost
","Let put a pin in the story for now what needs to be addressed is the multitude of historical and geographical errors. It has weaponry, clothing and other items that are centuries too early. Apart from the goofs already mentioned on here, Friar Tuck wears spectacles that wouldn't be invented till the 1700s ( and they kept appearing and dissapearing in the scenes he was using them ).
Locksley is about 45 miles from Nottingham and not on the outskirts as in the movie, also Nottingham is not on the coast or accessible by water ways from the sea yet the ship Robin arrives home on seems to arrive there.
Let's take that pin out, the story seems to jettison most of what is the common interpretation of the legend by totally sidelining most of Robin's Merry men but does set up for a possible and I have to say unwelcome sequel, so maybe they'll use them then. Yes it's a new take on the story but unfortunately it's also a bad one",/review/rw4889799/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2018,girvsjoint,2," Why Bother???
","I don't know why they continually try to remake/ reimagine Robin Hood? Try as they might, they never have, and never will top the 1938 classic Errol Flynn, Basil Rathbone version. Arguably the most perfectly cast , and executed film in history. There have been many attempts over the decades on both the large and small screen, but none have come close to recapturing the magic and charm of the original sound version 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' .",/review/rw4889799/?ref_=tt_urv

21 November 2018,sbweightman,2," A convoluted and anachronistic take on the classic story with weak jokes, poor characterization and mediocre special effects.
","The modern style to the action scenes adds a new flair to the events, but like the humour, doesn't really work in the historical setting. The story and acting is ok, but the film goes on for too long and characters are inconsistent. Boring more than entertaining, with few thrills or exciting scenes.",/review/rw4889799/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2018,gluonpaul,3," Good news, Russel Crowe is no longer the worst Robin Hood
","So the stylistic influence of the tv series the arrow was obvious throughout this movie and that lazy borrowing of others style pretty much sums this up. The lack of any real imagination is what epitomizes this movie. Most of the movie was just plain boring, dont get me wrong Robin Hood racks up a body count but just in a lackluster way.",/review/rw4889799/?ref_=tt_urv
