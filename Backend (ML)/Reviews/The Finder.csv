5 February 2007,kosmasp,10," Love it or hate it
","After I watched this movie for the first time, I thought it was dumbest piece of ... whatnot I had ever seen! But as time passed (merely a few hours) and while I couldn't get that movie out of my head, I realised that Terry G. again made a movie, that nobody else could've done ... at least not like this! Everyone was saying that you couldn't possibly make a movie out of that book ... and nay-sayers will still be convinced that it can't be done. But I've come to terms and really accepted this movie for what it is! A crazy hell of a ride movie, that is just ludicrous! And I love it! Every f**ing minute of it! And how could you write a review without even mentioning the F-word. Try to listen to the commentary by the real Hunter S. Thompson! That's the guy who wrote the book, for those who don't know.",/review/rw4528147/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2004,MovieAddict2016,10," ""We can't stop here. This is bat country!""
","""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is a twisted, outlandish venture into the mind of a warped junkie, a reporter who is traveling to Nevada in order to cover a Hells Angels motorcycle race, along with his Samoan attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro, who gained forty pounds for his role). ""We were somewhere around Barstow when the drugs began to take hold,"" is the line that opens the movie in an expeditious manner, as a red convertible roars from right to left, in the direction of Las Vegas. The vehicle's trunk is packed with an abundance of deadly drugs. ""We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers. Also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether, two dozen amyls.""",/review/rw4528147/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2003,vincent-27,," pointlessness is the point
","For all those of you who decry this movie for being pointless and lacking soul, that was the point! This is an excellent movie, a true adaptation of the book, nothing more and nothing less. It is an unflinching look at the sickening excesses of a consumption based culture of America during the early 1970's, who's vacuous heart resides in Las Vegas, a symbol of greed and debauchery. The pointlessness of the movie is a metaphor for the pointless pursuit of personal gratification and greed, the true heart of the ""American Dream"".",/review/rw4528147/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2020,mahmus,8," This film was too weird to live, yet too rare too die.
","Where to even start with this? What starts as a fun drug-fueled comedy slowly turns into a claustrophobic nightmare of grotesque imagery and sensory overload. I've never done any hallucinogetic drugs, but I imagine that after a while, the rush Would become a nightmare. This is an ugly movie. It's hard to watch. It's extremely uncfomfortable. And that's the point.",/review/rw4528147/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2000,Quinoa1984,10," Don't do drugs, just see this movie- Gilliam's masterpiece, perhaps
","Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a psychedelic comedy, but also an astute piece of literature-cum-political science on a period in American history that was just really strange, thus reflected by its creator. It was the pioneer in 'Gonzo journalism' and sent Thompson's star even higher than it had with Hell's Angels. Although it's one of my personal favorite books, it could have been tricky to adapt it- Alex Cox tried and failed- but somehow Terry Gilliam digs into the Thompson psychology, dementia, and off-the-wall humor, while also putting his unmistakable mark on the material. Two sensibilities thus merge, alongside the tremendous performances (underrated, despite the praise from fans) from Depp and Del-Toro. It asks an essential question- how does society end up crossing paths with the outlaws? But there's more than that- much more in fact- but it takes more than one viewing. I remember writing the first time I saw it: ""This film is so bizarre you might just want to put down the bong and get high from this movie (after all, the movie contains every single known drug known to man since 1544).""",/review/rw4528147/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2002,jduke,10," Visual masterpiece with Thompson's message intact and strong as ever.
","I have read countless reviews of this movie that have derided it for everything from glorifying drugs to being unchristian to being boring. Maybe my mind works very much like director Terry Gilliam's (I loved 'Brazil' and '12 Monkeys'), but the last thing I would do to this movie is deride it.  It is a brilliant adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's generation-defining book of the same name - it stays very faithful to the events in the book.",/review/rw4528147/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2002,Broudie69,10," One of the best films ever.
","It's hard to describe how good this movie is without sounding sycophantic but it really is that good. This film is based on the ""true"" story of when the notorious reporter Hunter S. Thompson and his then attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta went to Las Vegas to cover a bike race for rolling stone magazine but instead spent the entire trip going out of their minds on various illegal and legal chemicals. This may sound like a one trick pony for stoners and 60's throwbacks but I am neither and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Very few films based on books manage to tell the story or capture the spirit of the original but F&L certainly manages both. The story sticks closely enough to the book without alienating the books fan base but also trims out the right areas so that the film doesn't become overly long and uninteresting.",/review/rw4528147/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2012,alex-law321,9," I was reviewing ""Fear and Loathing and Las Vegas"" on IMDb.com when the drugs began to take hold
","When you start watching this movie, you'll decide if you like it or not. But if you don't want to wait, I'll tell you. This movie is so trippy, so gross, so insane, so bizarre, and so friggin' crazy! Now with that said, it's also brilliant, funny, surreal, dark, entertaining etc. The story goes like this; a Dr. Journalism, Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp), and his wolf man attorney, Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro), are sent to Las Vegas to cover a Mint 400 motorcycle race but end up abandoning that in search of the American Dream. The two characters are out of their minds on drugs the entire time which is where the surreal factor comes into play. The film is based the famous novel by Hunter S. Thompson, which was based on real life events he experienced. I'm not kidding when I say that five minutes into this movie and you'll feel that someone drugged your drink or something. This is more than just a movie, it's an experience, and an experience like no other. If you haven't read the book or don't know what your getting yourself into, then you're gonna have one hell of a ride. Johnny Depp (of course) nails the performance of the character that the book created. What director, Terry Gilliam, did is take the book and match the images that we thought of while reading it, perfectly. Throughout the film, watching the two characters wander witlessly around Las Vegas tripping on acid, I felt like I was part of the experience. Also, Depp's performance is so good, that I started to forget that he wasn't really Hunter S. Thompson. The characters are both psychotic but in different ways. Raoul Duke has one foot in reality and another foot in a pit of madness, Gonzo, however, is off his rocker. He's just a ticking atom bomb ready to go off, I'd be scared to stay in the same room as him. But what keeps this movie going strong is the narration by Depp. Some of it's recited from the book but other times it's whatever's on his mind. Without the narration, the movie would be just one wacky thing after another. Overall, watching this movie is like being hit by a car, sucked into a tornado, spat out into a trampoline factory, raped by a wild tiger, eaten by Godzilla, thrown off the face of the Earth, and plummeting right down on the TV. Any negative reviews you may have heard about this movie make no sense. They love the book while hate the film for being so crazy and shapeless (oh, you mean exactly like the book). This is a perfect adaptation of the book. So great performances, surreal scenery, flowing narration, and a clever cameo by Thompson himself. When I first saw this movie, I liked it just fine. I've seen a few more times and every time I see it, it gets better. Now it's gotten to the point where I think it's one of the best films ever made. So if you're a Johnny Depp fan, or a Terry Gilliam fan, or a Hunter S. Thompson fan, or just in the mood for something different and I mean REALLY different, definitely check it out.",/review/rw4528147/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2005,daveisit,8," Slippery Mice
","This is far from your everyday movie, and only for those with a deep appreciation for the diversity of film-making, or fans of Hunter S. Thompson. This does not mean those mentioned will enjoy it, although definitely respect the attempt. I personally found it fascinating. To portray a permanently drug induced state to the big screen was done with creativity and subtle humour. You could expect nothing less from director Terry Gilliam who has played such a massive role in the brilliant and original Monty Python works. ",/review/rw4528147/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2004,smriga,10," The art of character acting...
","I think the people who reviewed this film are a bit warped for thinking of it as anything less than a masterpiece. This film comes from the glorious days of Johnny Depp taking obscure roles in films and totally immersing himself in the character. Benecio Del Toro's performance was second to none, and I cannot for the life of me comprehend why someone would think this to be the ""worst movie ever"". God save us that we actually have to think a little when we sit in those awful theatre seats. Heaven forbid we're required to use our imagination a little bit and not have it handed to us in the form of Hollywood mindless pap. The film, del toro, Depp, and of course, Gilliam are all brilliant. I pity the fools who gave this movie a negative review and fail miserably in articulating their reasoning.",/review/rw4528147/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10," As your attorney, I suggest that you watch this
","I haven't read any of S. Thompson's work, though I do know the basic nature of it. Thus, I can't for sure determine if this is more the result of his warped imagination, or that of Gilliam. Like few, if any, other films ever made, this puts you right inside the head of someone who is high. From start to finish, that is the look, feel, sound and mood of this(as far as I know). The paranoia, the 'logic', the fear, the bizarre sights, everything. Set design, costumes and effects are all excellent, and help build the freaky atmosphere. The editing is masterful, and the cinematography has a dynamic ""loose"" quality to it that really adds to the experience and the feel of it. This has brilliant and impeccably delivered, infinitely quotable dialog, as well as countless unforgettable moments. The acting is incredible, Del Toro and especially Depp are spot-on. All of the roles are perfectly cast; I even liked Penn Jillette. This is engaging, and immensely so, for how far out it is. There is a lot of disturbing content, constant strong language, explicit descriptions of sex, and brief nudity. I recommend this to any and all fans of Hunter and/or Terry. 10/10",/review/rw4528147/?ref_=tt_urv

10 February 2021,edrybaaudio,10," ""As your attorney, I advise you to watch this movie"".
","That's really what my lawyer told me, as he did when Hunter S. Thompson's story came out in book form. It was originally published as a two-part article in Rolling Stone magazine, at which time it was described to me in detail by my attorney. I saw the film again last night on TV, on one of the ""Starz"" cable channels. It reminded me of my attorney's words, and of how right his advice was. Having read Thompson's story BEFORE SEEING THE MOVIE, this film was and is A SCREAM!!! Director Terry Gilliam (of Monty Python fame - he made all the truly silly transitional animation for the ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" TV show, and was the only man of American heritage involved in the otherwise British comedy troupe). Gilliam Directed the Python films ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", and ""Life of Brian"", co-Directed with Terry Jones. Gilliam also Directed a number of delightful movies for George Harrison's production Company, Handmade Films, including ""Time Bandits"" and the somewhat fanciful and effects-laden ""The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen. ""Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas"" is remarkably faithful to Thompson's writing in a way few other film adaptations of published written works have ever been, so if you think the movie's weird and have not read Thompson's book, you really should. Thompson was the inventor of what he called ""Gonzo Journalism"", and the articles he wrote for Rolling Stone are prime examples of it, especially THIS STORY! Other reviewers have given you examples of some of the action depicted in the film, so there's no no need for me to include spoilers here. I do, however highly recommend this film... but READ THE BOOK FIRST if you can!",/review/rw4528147/?ref_=tt_urv
