",Michael Shannon should get at least an Academy Award for his performance in this movie. This guy can act and you lose the person and totally see the characters he portrays. Reminds me of Daniel Day Lewis.,/review/rw4934731/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. Dramatizations are at their best when actual footage of the subject or event doesn't exist. They can be an effective way to highlight a particularly interesting story or person with details we might not otherwise access. Richard Kuklinski's story is fascinating and frightening. He is known as the mob's most prolific hit-man/contract killer. Writer/director Arial Vromen has adapted Anthony Bruno's novel for the screen, and wisely cast Michael Shannon in the lead. It makes a nice companion piece to the chilling 1992 documentary The Iceman Tapes: Conversations with a Killer.",/review/rw4934731/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2016,claudio_carvalho,7," The Impressive True Story of a Family Man and Notorious Cold Blood Killer
","In 1964, Richard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) dates Deborah Pellicotti (Winona Ryder) and kills a man that made an offensive comment about her during a game of pool. The violent Kuklinski works dubbing porn films but he tells to Deborah that he dubs Disney cartoons. Soon they get married and have two daughters. When his boss Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta) closes the laboratory where Kuklinski works, he is invited to work as contract hit man after a test killing a homeless man. Along the years he works for Roy but he falls in disgrace when he let a teenager hooker that witnessed a killing freely go since he does not kill children. Kuklinski begins to work independently as a free-lancer irritating Roy that threatens his family and him. In 1986, Kuklinski is arrested by the police after committing more than one hundred murders.",/review/rw4934731/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2013,kinoreview,," Read the book - 'The Iceman' is a woefully underdeveloped disappointment
","Having read Philip Carlo's biography of Richard Kuklinski 'The Ice Man: Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer', I can say that Ariel Vromen's big screen adaptation 'The Iceman' is a big disappointment. While the author had a habit of repeating himself and some of Richard's recollections seemed rather dubious in places, Carlo's lengthy book was an engrossing read, I enjoyed it very much.",/review/rw4934731/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2013,tomgillespie2002,4," A massive, formulaic disappointment, with a towering performance from Michael Shannon
","Having developed a morbid fascination with serial killers over the past few years, I was delighted to hear that Richard Kuklinski, one of the most prolific and emotionless mass murderers in history, was to be given the cinematic treatment. Not only was his story ripe for a juicy adaptation, but Michael Shannon, the most consistently mesmerising actor working in film today, was cast as the titular Iceman. Sadly, inexperienced director Ariel Vromen, who up to this point had only made two films I've never heard of, has delivered a by-the-numbers biopic; one that follows familiar genre conventions and whitewashes Kuklinski's story completely in favour of a formula that a mainstream audience can comfortably follow.",/review/rw4934731/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2013,Ed-Shullivan,8," Michael Shannon...The New Face of Evil for Decades To Come
","Wow!! What a great feature film for Michael Shannon to display his range of acting and depth of character portrayal as the real New Jersey contract (serial?) killer, Richard Kuklinski. Michael Shannon has played dark brooding characters before such as in his roles in movies like My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done, as Brad McCullum, The Man of Steel as General Zod, and in Take Shelter as the father Curtis LaForche, of a family who believe his fixation on building an underground shelter is too extreme. He also plays a dark brooding character in Boardwalk Empire, whose role evolves from a former Prohibition Agent on the run after murdering his partner, to the muscle for a bootlegger. In my watching Michael Shannon evolve as an actor over the past 20 years of film making, I believe he has found his true calling in the mobster/crime genre.",/review/rw4934731/?ref_=tt_urv

","I had to drive over 70miles one way to watch this movie and was it worth it? Hard to say if one watched ""the iceman tapes"" from HBO. To me personally it was disappointing, but I probably expected way too much. So lower your expectations and you will have a nice evening in the cinema. ",/review/rw4934731/?ref_=tt_urv

14 August 2013,Sergeant_Tibbs,7," Difficult to emotionally invest in but wickedly entertaining.
","With 2011's Take Shelter, Michael Shannon is proving to be a fascinating leading man. Just through his presence, he can convey that unstable line between sanity and insanity and bad and good. You can just tell his inner conflict is going to explode at boiling point. It's unfortunate that while Shannon certainly transforms into the 'iceman,' The Iceman's script doesn't call for much of his range. Instead, it's a moody gangster film that revels in the moments where it can step just beyond the clich√©s while still pressing all the standard buttons. It's interesting in these kinds of scenes where a mob boss forces an associate to give to a homeless person or Shannon lets James Franco's cameo pray to God just to see what happens. It's a well-acted film, particularly Winona Ryder standing out in the supporting cast and it's very slickly made. But the fundamental problem with the film is its rhythm. The editing is constantly hectic even at the smallest things. There's no natural fluctuations that give emotional moments gravitas or action moments excitement. It does end up fatiguing and it lessens the sense of journey and change. Nevertheless, it's still a wickedly entertaining thrill ride to the end, just blunt at its edges.",/review/rw4934731/?ref_=tt_urv

1 October 2013,eddie_baggins,4," As cold as it's main man
",For a true life story about arguably one of the most notorious mob hit-man in history (kill total suspected to be over 100 victims) The Iceman sure does a good job of being pretty uninteresting and uninvolving for the majority of its relatively short running time. The reason behind this mediocrity can be attributed to the films lack of quality control and production.,/review/rw4934731/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2015,Leofwine_draca,7," Nice, classic-feeling gangster movie
","THE ICEMAN is based on the supposed true story of a Mafia hit-man who killed hundreds of people during a period ranging from the 1960s to the 1980s. It's deliberately styled to reflect the 'classic' gangster films of yesteryear, particularly Scorsese's GOODFELLAS, taking place in the same era and even with some of the same cast members (Ray Liotta, here taking the sort of role Robert De Niro would have played back in the day).",/review/rw4934731/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2013,aharmas,9," Smoldering and Volcanic Acting
","Michael Shannon performs with such magnetic power that one can't keep from looking at the screen and wondering just how lethal his next move is going to be. His acting is so powerful it keeps drawing us closer, even though the nature of his character and his actions are repulsive and deplorable. Yet there is another side, barely hinted at that shows his humanity, and with his interaction and support of his devoted wife, beautifully played by Wynona Ryder, we wonder what makes him tick.",/review/rw4934731/?ref_=tt_urv

","There are some lives that don't require reflection in the form of film and surely the true life of professional murderer (100 killings) Richard Kuklinski is one of them. But because biographies have been written about him (Anthony Bruno's ""The Iceman: The True Story of a Cold-Blooded Killer"" and James Thebaut's documentary ""The Iceman Tapes: Conversations with a Killer""), it became a sure thing that we would have to actually watch this life on the screen (as written by Morgan Land and director Ariel Vromen).

19 December 2013,bjhomeboy08,9," Michael Shannon is Cold as Ice
","The Iceman was an amazing, gritty, and gruesome movie that portrays death unlike other films. Michael Shannon continues to showcase his acting prowess as Richard Kuklinski. As Kuklinski continues to kill he becomes increasingly addicted by his gruesome actions, and like most addicts Kuklinski has masterfully concealed his secret life from his loved ones. But unlike other psychopathic killers, Kiklinski is motivated by a basic human trait, which is to support his family. Although being a hit-man is not an ideal profession, it does have a huge cash reward.",/review/rw4934731/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2013,AaronHickory,8," Well done, but disappointing
","The Iceman is a great film overall, with very skillful ""execution"" in most categories. Unfortunately, if you know anything about the real Richard Kuklinksi, you may find yourself disappointed. I saw both parts of the HBO documentary, The Iceman Tapes, and because of that extra knowledge it left me wanting after the film ended. The main flaw here was that they didn't depict what a truly sick bastard this man was. Such disturbing anecdotes that were described in the documentary, such as a day when Mr. Kuklinski decided to test out a crossbow on a random citizen's face ""just to see what happened,"" and a time when he let a man be eaten alive by rats, filmed it, and watched it later, were not depicted. I still found this movie to be worth watching, and deserving of high marks, but if you know anything about the true story, don't go in with unreasonable expectations.",/review/rw4934731/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2012,AmericanFilmTheory,7," Decent gangster flick, minus the charm and depth of Goodfellas
","Iceman Ariel Vromen's The Iceman might succeed too well in depicting its subject, mob hit-man Richard Kuklinski. I saw this film recently at the Toronto International Film Festival, and was lucky enough to hear Vromen's Q&A afterwards. This is a solid gangster movie if you're an aficionado of the genre, but because it doesn't probe very far beneath the surface of this true story, it fails to reach the status of a great film. In fact, I think much of the audience left the theatre with the impression that this was mostly a meditation on mental illness.",/review/rw4934731/?ref_=tt_urv

","The film is based on the true life story of hitman Richard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon). Richard starts out making copies of porno films for the mob when Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta) recognizes his talent and turns him into a hitman. The story goes that his family didn't know anything about his hitman life, most likely made up by their attorney. It is said he killed over 100 men, although we only get the main hits. A montage of hits done to some good background music would have given us a better feel for his notoriety. One story is that Kuklinski killed Hoffa. The film avoids that controversy.",/review/rw4934731/?ref_=tt_urv
