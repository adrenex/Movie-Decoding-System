20 March 2020,Arweljos,10," Hope theres a second series
","Really enjoyed this, quirky show, very entertaining and funny. Great acting and very natural, hope they get a second series, cant understand the odd low rating from some, they must not understand subtle humour, they probably prefer shows with canned laughter so they get prompts to know when to laugh!",/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2021,staciarose20,8," Funny and a bit crazy.
","First, the cell phone story... you know the one. Cell phones in 1989 were enormous, and that story with her husband cracked me up. This has everything I love about Australian comedies. Diane Morgan always makes me laugh. Some of her lines are so crazy.",/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2019,leoalexanderscott,9," Riches to rags story
","Frayed has become one of my favourite weekly Australian comical-style series. There is something about this well written drama yet satire of early Eighties life in Australia that gets you hook. The family, their friends, the era, the political and social climate, the fashion and icons of the era. You can start watching from any episode. All you need to know about the ""riches to rags"" story is that Sammy Cooper brings her two children to live with her mother and brother in the beachside mansion of the northern Sydney suburb of Newscastle, while waiting for the settlement of a will when her husband suddenly dies from a heart attack during fitness training. Except that Newcastle isn't a suburb, the mansion is just a small old beach home, the suspicious brother suspects Sammy being up to no good, and she is forced to become a secretary for local bribe-influenced member of parliament. Did I mention that meanwhile back in UK, she getting her estate screwed over, getting taken advantage of because her husband died after a brick mobile was shoved up the backside by a prostitute.",/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2019,matthewbrewster999,," Needs to come back for another series!
","Gutted there were only 6 episodes of this, to be fair to some of the people who have given it low ratings based on the 1st show, it does get better the deeper you get into it, once the characters have landed in Australia you see different sides to them and I liked that the storylines focus on not just the 3 original members of the family but also the extended family and friends based in Australia. Everyone has their own story to tell and is experiencing some kind of traumatic life event in some way. The humour isn't laugh out loud jokes and simplistic misunderstandings or wordplay but based around a sense of awkwardness and a sense of real life situations and interactions between the characters, which makes them even more engaging. The ending leaves a mass of loose ends so I really hope a second season is commissioned soon!",/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2020,hanaahbraan,," Thoroughly enjoyable
","This show is a definite grower. I started watching it on a plane and got hooked after three episodes. The story develops really well, but all too closely towards the end. The characters are honest and a good representation of Australia even in the present day. I want and need to see more of this!",/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2019,robbobconn,10," Surprising hit
","I did not expect much when I started watching this, thinking it was another run of the mill comedy. But, the more I watched the more I fell in love with this absolute gem. It became one of my favourite TV shows. It has just the right blend of comedy and drama, moves at a good pace, just enough story lines and characters that it is not too much too follow. I really hope this pearl gets a second season, because it has so much more to offer. Brilliantly written by Sarah Kendall, who does a great job of portraying every facet of her character. To be honest, the story line descriptions do not do this series justice. It is so much more than ""a wealthy woman loses her fortunes and moves back to Australia"". We are addicted to it and are binge watching it but with only 6 episodes, one runs out of episodes very quickly. Looking forward to the next installment.",/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv

","I happened to stumble across this show accidentally and am so glad I did. It's hilarious, heartwarming, and I really hope it comes back for a second season!",/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2020,christophersarles,10," Absolutely loved it!
","The characters were fresh and zany and never boring or stereotypical, the acting was superb, and there were several comedic situations and gags that made me laugh out loud.",/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2019,erumeh,10," Joined imdb purely to rate this.
","Just had to contradict the people who just don't get it.
Best thing I've watched this year.
A laugh out loud work of art.
Next...",/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2019,delphinoz,10," Delicious .. more please.
","London to Newcastle in the 80's! They nailed it well .. seriously there were a lot more 'over the top' characters around back then anyway, including 'larrikin' females. The show is irreverent, brash and hilarious with some depth and empathy in there too. Kudos to the cast, writer and director for a very funny and entertaining season, hope there's more to come.",/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv

1 October 2019,peterrichboy,8," Entertaining comedy from Sky/ABC
","This is a really enjoyable joint Anglo Australian comedy set in the late 80's about a wealthy woman who's world collapses when her husband dies, leaving her penniless and homeless. She is forced to return to her native Australian family and has to rebuild her life with her spoilt kids as well as facing her personal demons from years gone buy. Nicely written and starring Sarah Kendal in the lead role, and some fine comic talent from Australia and the UK, Frayed is well worth a watch. 8/10",/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2019,chris-74030,8," Bloody funny
","OK I am the first to admit that people who were born in the 80,s or later probably are probably to young to appreciate the humour. But I and my wife laughed until we cried at some parts of this show Only seen the first episode but gagging for more as they say",/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2020,deansolar,9," You wont be disappointed
","This is a good watch, the characters and dialogue in it are sometimes laugh out loud. The aussie side to it makes it different to some of the typical garbage British or American comedies that try too hard and just arent funny. If you want a laugh at something origional then try this.",/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv

",Just finished this series. Started and stopped half way through the first episode. So glad I stuck with it. It is fab. Fingers crossed there is another series. I could see this run and run.,/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2019,mrouse-92084,10," Terrific!
","If you have some inkling of Australian life in the 80's, today and visited Newcastle (NSW) at least once, you will love this. Particularly liked the performances of the secretary, Diane Morgan and the dear lady with dementia, Maggie Dence",/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2021,Headturner1,7," really liked
",This. I had tried to watch it a while ago and turned it off about 10 minutes in well I watched 4 episodes last night and then the 5th wouldn't play. There is a lot of unnecessary stupid humour( especially when Jim and Sam fight) but then there's some really funny stuff. I saw the actor who plays Jim in another Australian series recently and He's a great actor( funny as heck) and I really like the actress who plays the mother tho she looks too young to have kids their ages. Any ways reminds me of something Waller Bridge would write. I loved Catastrophe and that's why I decided to give it another go. Glad I did. Wish their was more than 6 episodes.,/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2020,laurabenzel,10," Loved It
","This is a hilarious show, I binged watched all the episodes in one night. The lead actress (Simone/Sammy) is excellent, as are the actors who play her children. I sure hope there is a second season. Highly recommend it.",/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv

14 October 2021,supermellowcali,9," Awesome
","A comedy with no jokes? YES. Far more difficult than the tired humor repeated with canned audience laughter, and far more rewarding for those of us paying attention. Thanks for a very good story and even better execution. Excellent actors and production, well done.",/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2019,barb-72716,," Good Aussie tv
",I am a person who cringes at Kath and Kim and I really didn't really like The Castle. But I think Frayed is great. It is crass but it has laugh out loud moments. And I have just found out that the script writer is the main actor just before watching episode three. Which is a great achievement. And I really care about Kerry Armstrong's character. I think it is excellent Australian television.,/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv

",If you took Laurel and Hardy and put the most foul mouths on them that you can imagine... this is close. If you can handle that... this will be entertaining for you. The slapstick can be over the top and sometimes corny... and gets old after a while. Some of the Australian social issues that are poked fun at... are revealing and sad. The acting matches the content.,/review/rw7466197/?ref_=tt_urv
