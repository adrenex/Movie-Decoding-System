21 February 2006,ccthemovieman-1,8," Stylish Mayhem
","This is simply what the above headline states: an ultra-violent movie done is stylish cinematography. Walter Hill, a nasty director who does this sort of thing (violent, profane films but usually with great visual appeal) did it in spades on this one. This is testosterone gone berserk.....and very entertaining.",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2006,fertilecelluloid,8," Brutal, masculine entertainment handicapped by one flawed sequence.
","This brutal Walter Hill pic has one of the best beatings ever burned to celluloid. It is so brutal, in fact, that the victim (Bruce Willis) looks like Jason from ""Friday The 13th"" once his attackers get done with him. Even better, he then lurches around like Rondo Hatten in ""The Creep Man"" plotting his revenge.",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2004,mickdansforth,8," Bruce Willis doing The Red Harvest
","This movie is a Gangster remake of Clint East Wood's A Fistful of Dollars which is a Western remake of Yojimbo which is a samurai adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's The Red Harvest. When adapting the first time Akira Kurosawa changed the amount of gangs involved from 4 to 2. Every version since then has had only 2. The Continental Op, The Man With No Name, Mifune's Samurai, and Bruce Willis's John Smith. All Nameless. All working all sides to their own end.",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2004,bannonanthony,7," I loved this movie from the first time I saw it.
","I've become a big fan of Walter Hill's movies and this one is as good as ever. It's not a particularly cheery film, but it's still enjoyable. Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken are both terrific in their roles. Walken plays as good a bad guy as ever, and Willis is good as the ambiguous lead character.",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2007,poolandrews,5," ""They were all better off dead..."" Dull period action saved somewhat by Willis.
","Last Man Standing tells the tale of a gun for hire (Bruce Willis) who is travelling through Texas to get to Mexico, about 50 miles from the Texan border he stops at a ghost town called Jericho which is run by two Irish & Italian feuding Chicago bootlegging gangs. They currently have a truce but tensions are high between them, he checks things out & finds the local Sheriff Ed Galt (Bruce Dern) is bent & he senses he can make some easy money. First he kills a couple of men working for gang leader Doyle (David Patrick Kelly) & is promptly hired by Doyle's rival gang leader Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg), he calls himself 'John Smith' & begins to play the two gangs off each other as he passes information along which will make him lots of money. However Smith becomes too involved & as the situation spirals out of control just about everyone wants him dead...",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2003,boraxx,," It's very orange
","This film is a bit of an oddity. A remake of a remake, the story is so obvious you are never surprised by events, but the gunfights are pretty entertaining and Christopher Walken's turn as the husky baddie Hickey is suitably menacing. Also the fact that the attractive brunette has a completely pointless scene where she is topless in front of the mirror is a bonus. :) The camera work is stylish and the discordant guitar riffage of Mr.Ry Cooder is superb, the pace is slow but not sluggish and you can almost feel the heat and dust. This film is good but not great. Er... that's it.",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2006,winner55,8," farewell to the romantic adventurer
","They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery - When the Last Man standing first came out, it was hard not to make the connection between that film and Yojimbo (since Yojimbo's script was credited -although not the original source for Yojimbo, an American crime novel, red Harvest, by Dashiell Hammet - Yojimbo's Kurosawa also forgot to credit in his film). But even a critic as astute as Roger Ebert only thought the film was only 'similar' to ""Fistful of Dollars"" even though the plots of the two films have more in common than that of this film and Yojimbo.",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2013,hitchcockthelegend,7," And like Jericho, Walls come tumbling down.
","Last Man Standing is directed by Walter Hill who also adapts the screenplay from a story written by Ryûzô Kikushima and Akira Kurosawa. It stars Bruce Willis, Bruce Dern, William Sanderson, Christopher Walken, David Patrick Kelly, Karina Lombard and Ned Eisenberg. Music is by Ry Cooder and cinematography by Lloyd Ahern.",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2017,PredragReviews,7," ""1911 Heaven""
","This one is a cult classic that while formulaic, still manages to engage and keep the viewer captivated. Filled with old west clichés, yet set in the Prohibition Era, the six shooters have been replaced with 1911's, and the horses with Model Ts. Exaggerated impacts, and body reactions to getting shot, coupled with the never ending supply of ammo that only rarely needs to be topped off, do get annoying. Yet, somehow, the viewer is still sucked into this modern take on Clint Eastwood's classic, A Fistful Of Dollars.",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2011,Samiam3,6," Macho, stylish but not very brainy, medium good film
","For Last Man Standing, director Walter Hill relocates Kurosawa's Yojimbo to depression era America in a dusty desert town. There is something arguably distinctive about the flick. Perhaps it is the merger of gangster and western; something seldom seen in movies. Or perhaps it is the way that Hill's visual portrayal of a time and place seems flawless. Last Man Standing has an exceptionally retro look to it, very crusty and dusty, and also very macho.",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,4," The grumbling narration ruined it for me
","Although the story's nothing new, this different action outing gets by on looks alone. Shot in sepia, the film brings a dead-end western town to life - along with all of the reptilian crooks and criminals who live in it. Walter Hill perhaps manages too well in recreating his lifeless town, as the whole film is weighted down by an oppressive atmosphere of boredom and depression. Or maybe that's just me ",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2020,UniqueParticle,8," Great western better than most
","One of very few I could put up with cause it comes with Last Boy Scout as a combo Blu-Ray at the same time it's very enjoyable! Lots of whacky characters, great action, nice cars and wonderful cinematography! Walter Hill is a masterful action director for films like 48 hours, Another 48 hours, Supernova, and The Warriors. So gentle at times and brutally violent other times, solid mix.",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2011,oneguyrambling,6," Breaks no new ground, but Hill and Willis make it watchable.
","Not much rattles John Smith (Bruce Willis), he has the sort of unflappable self-confidence that requires not an absolute belief in one's own abilities, but the misguided thought that one could control the uncontrollable.",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2007,ShootingShark,6," Dusty, Stylish, Macho Detective-Samurai-Western-Gangster Hybrid Movie
","In prohibition times, a mysterious stranger drifts into the ramshackle town of Jericho on the American-Mexican border, run by two rival gangs of bootleggers.

23 June 2005,TOMASBBloodhound,5," A mean and dusty movie.
","You get the feeling that somewhere underneath all that dust there was a good movie waiting to be made. This Walter Hill film is really nothing too exceptional, though. How in the world could any movie in which Bruce Willis fires so many rounds of ammunition lose 49 million dollars? The film uses the ancient story of a mysterious drifter waltzing into town and pitting himself between two rival gangs. This plot has been used in westerns, samurai films, you name it. This film takes place in a dusty west Texas town which seems to exist only for the purpose of being a midway point for bootlegging during Prohibition. Two gangs have an uneasy truce going when Willis drives into town and starts wreaking havoc. One gang is led by David Patrick Kelly, who is an old Walter Hill stand-by actor. The other is led by Ned Eisenberg. You may remember him as being the guy from Moving Violations who is really into horror films. Both gangs are incompetent, but at least Kelly has the services of Christopher Walken's savage character on his side. Willis predictably routes these gangs, or sets up scenarios where they can kill off each other.",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2007,Patedwalters,7," Enjoyable if rather dark action movie
","This movie serves fine for some action, with excellently dark shoot-outs being shown as John Smith (Bruce Willis), as he has told us at least, wonders into this town and quickly learns to play the two opposing gangs for all they are worth, willing to kill in the process of course, which he does expertly while wielding two colt .45 1911's masterfully. This movie recalls both the westerns of of the sixties, one of which, For a Fistful of Dollars, is another adaptation of this movie's source material, Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, as well as the noir movies of the 40's. This may work for some but it does feel rather odd, in both a good and bad way. Bruce Willis, in grim and monotone manner, is perfect for the narration held in between the shoot-outs. This narration, along with the costume's of the characters, fedora's and all, are cheerful reminders of the noir movies of past, to show that perhaps that genre has a little life left within it. The desert setting in which this 1860's style ghost town, in which the two rival gangs square off, both with help from our main character, is located in is the main reminder then of the western part of this movie as well.

16 December 1998,helpless_dancer,4," How can this drivel be manufactured in the name of entertainment?
","Boy! What a stupid movie! Bruce Willis can beat this garbage, not by much I admit, but somewhat. I hate the Rambo type who can enter a corrupt town, and become bullet proof as he mows down the opposition. Our hero uses 2 unaimed handguns to obliterate a pack of machine-gun toting mafia thugs with the ease of swatting flies. Plus he got the girl. I was bored to tears watching this bilge, therefore, I must question my own intelligence for sitting through the entire thing. I guess I will salve my own conscience by saying 'I just kept waiting for it to get better'. Too bad it never did. What a turkey.",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2007,fedor8,," Willis whispers.
","LMS is an unusual combination of western and gangster film. It's pretty much a stylish fantasy action film, which some people didn't seem to understand. Most of the criticism seems to be directed at how precise Willis shoots and that he's apparently immune to bullets. But LMS isn't exactly meant to be nitpicked over as if it were some semi-documentary or biopic. Very early on the tone of the film is established, making the viewer understand that LMS is more to be enjoyed almost as a simple shoot-'em-up computer game. Of course, one needs to be a somewhat intelligent viewer or at least someone who has experience watching movies to grasp this simple fact. (I love people who review, for example, thrillers without having seen more than 10 of them altogether.) ",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2017,TheLittleSongbird,5," Two sides to every war
","Was not expecting much from 'Last Man Standing'. Despite a good cast on paper and a competent director who did generally deserve a better reputation, its reception at the time was mixed to negative and today is not much better (though as one has seen with many films audience reaction has been a little kinder to it over time).",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 1999,CuriosityKilledShawn,10," I love it to death
","This has to be one of the best action, western and gangster movies I've ever seen. Willis was perfect for the part of John Smith (his voice-over has some of the best dialogue ever and if you don't believe me check out the opening scene), a gun for hire without a conscience. All elements of each genre are highly spoken for.",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2006,ninjanic1,10," Great Gangster Action Movie and Actors/Characters
","I really enjoyed Bruce Willis's character and the supporting cast chosen noting Walken(Hickey)and Kelly(Doyle). They really made the characters interesting to the audience and they deserve much credit for doing such a good job in this older film. I have seen many of Willis's movies and say this one is underrated and unique. In addition, it was well written with many twists to the plot, keeping you on the edge of your seat. If you are an action movie shoot them up fan, like gangster type movies and appreciate the older scenery of the pre 1930's. I would recommend this movie highly. Kudos to those who made this movie as I rate it as one of my all time favorites.",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2002,rupie,4," should have sat down at the outset
","Violence, even strong violence, is ok in a film, if, like Sam Peckinpah - the George Balanchine of movie violence - you know how to integrate it into a worthwhile story line with some inherent meaning. With this flick, it looks like all the egregiously bloody shoot-em-'up scenes were filmed first, and then a desperate search was undertaken to find some way to string them together. The film is just a pointless parade of gore, a nihilist orgy of screen violence. I expected more with people like Christopher Walken and Bruce Dern involved, but I guess a paycheck is a paycheck. Bruce Willis is a far better actor than this film would make you believe. On a lesser level of complaint, finding gangs of men fully dressed in 3-piece suits in a sagebrush backwater town in ninety-degree heat would not have been likely in the 20's. And where are the residents of this seedy burg? The only other characters we see other than the gangsters and their molls is the sheriff and the garage mechanic, which doesn't make it seem likely that there is enough business to sustain not 1 but 2 Chicago-style gangs. A complete waste of time.",/review/rw0389375/?ref_=tt_urv
