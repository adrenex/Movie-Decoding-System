7 January 2017,shobanchittuprolu,8," Sing Street is a delightful film that is almost impossible to watch without a smile on your face and tapping of your feet for its outstanding soundtrack.
","Sing Street (2016): Films about people at school forming bands are well known for being 60% more lovable than any other sort, and this movie is no exception.Sing Street,directed by Irish Film maker John Carney,has already been nominated for 74th Golden Globe Awards but sadly it will lose it to La La Land.If not for La La Land,Sing Street has all the necessary emotions and qualities to win a best musical movie of 2016.Why am I boasting it up before the review?You will see..",/review/rw3634498/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2017,CinemaClown,," The Feel-Good Irish Movie Of The Year
","A beautifully balanced, sensibly narrated & splendidly performed indie covering the highs & lows of teenage life while demonstrating the magic of creating music with all the romance of the art in tact Sing Street is a heartfelt ode to the carefree, joyous days of growing up and with its subtle touch of melancholy & hummable soundtrack, delivers an experience that's delightfully captivating.",/review/rw3634498/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2016,bkrauser-81-311064,9," Irresistibly Charming
","There's nothing quite like the creative process. We've all had that feeling; unfolding with all its frenzied excitement, malleable thoughts and brainstorms and inventive problem-solving. Yet creativity isn't just limited to what music you make, what stories you write, what paintings you paint. Flexing the limits of your creativity is almost like a window into your identity. Do you look for the easy fix, do you power through despite mental blocks, do you try the unexpected or bend towards an originality or an universality. So it goes with Sing Street, a movie that expands the notion of creativity itself, making an unabashedly and irresistibly charming film.",/review/rw3634498/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2016,bob-the-movie-man,8," Gregory's Commitments
","Ah, the joy and pain of first love! Young Conor (aka Cosmo, played in his impressive debut by Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) has the smelly end of a shitty stick to deal with while growing up in 1980's Dublin. He has warring parents with the need – for financial reasons - to move Conor from his posh school to 'Singe Street' Catholic school: a decidedly rougher and tougher place, ruled over with a rod of iron by Brother Baxter (Don Wycherley). This is a place of chaos and mayhem, ruled over by bullies of the likes of Barry (a superbly intimidating Ian Kenny).",/review/rw3634498/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2016,Jaymay,9," Against all odds, John Carney does it again
","I'm a huge fan of the movie Once. When I arrived at South By Southwest, and saw that John Carney had directed another movie, I have to say I was a bit skeptical that he could capture the magic of that movie again without the amazing music and raw performances of Glen Hansard.",/review/rw3634498/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2016,billntoumos,9," Surprisingly delightful
","I didn't expect such a good movie to be honest. The plot sounded interesting but when you watch the movie you get hooked in about 10 minutes. The characters are incredible with their own personality ( i really liked main characters brother , his story was great). The soundtrack was...oh man...it was incredible and a great addition to the movie. ",/review/rw3634498/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2016,dave-mcclain,8," ""Sing Street"" is music to the ears - and the heart.
","Few (if any) of us were who we wanted to be when we were in high school. While high school girls often think they're not pretty enough or popular enough, boys fear they're not cool enough or tough enough. Of course, these are only a few of the characteristics that teens in high school – both boys and girls believe they lack. The point is, during adolescence, all kids think that they're not ""enough"" of something. Well, I say ""enough already"" – and so does Irish writer-director John Carney, through his music-oriented comedy-drama ""Sing Street"" (PG-13, 1:46). This is a film that shows us it's okay to be insecure and sad sometimes, but you can also learn to be happy during those times and even to rise above them. ""Happy-Sad"" the film calls it. I call the film insightful, encouraging and entertaining.",/review/rw3634498/?ref_=tt_urv

",Greetings again from the darkness. The vast majority of 1980's music usually inspires nothing but groans and an immediate change of the radio channel from me. Yet writer/director John Carney masterfully captured and held my attention with this crowd-pleasing story that leans heavily on the tunes from that era.,/review/rw3634498/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2016,sammyboo21-999-252517,10," My Favorite movie of 2016 so far.
","The movie to beat this summer isn't a superhero movie.Its a movie about a teenager forming a band to try and impress a girl. What a wonderful and beautiful movie this. I was smiling and hugging myself throughout. So light and warm hearted and funny and yet deep and powerful. The Music is amazing even the original songs are fantastic. It is directed by the great John Carney who directed one of my favorite movies about music, Once. This is one of the best coming of age stories I've ever seen. It stands with Say Anything, Stand By ME, Perks of Being a wallflower, The fault in our stars. Please just go watch this movie. Please. I Loved it. ***** out of 5.",/review/rw3634498/?ref_=tt_urv

13 April 2016,SanFranciscoCinephile,," Dream big, and listen to your older brother
","I'm a sucker for movies about musicians, and John Carney has already given us Once (2007) and Begin Again (2013). Now he delights once more with Sing Street, a tale told with humor, drama, and some pretty catchy songs, all set in the backdrop of 1980's Dublin.",/review/rw3634498/?ref_=tt_urv

20 May 2016,themadmovieman,7," A nice nostalgia tour, but a little too much style over substance
","This is a nice film. It's a coming of age tale with heart, it's got a great soundtrack, and some pretty good performances. However, rather than telling a properly compelling story, Sing Street often feels a little too preoccupied with portraying its time period. It undoubtedly paints a picture of mid-80s pop culture very well, but that's at the expense of a genuinely engrossing story, making this seem like a little too much style over substance.",/review/rw3634498/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2016,VLHdelaParra,10," The movie you've always wanted if you were a teen in the '80s!
","I'm happy to grade this movie a full blast 10. I was a teenager in 1985 in the last private Catholic Boarding School left in Mexico City. I relate to the strict uniform policy, the angry and imperfect young Catholic brothers still guessing their vocations, the old professors teaching materials for yester years, the canteen food, hiding Walkman radios and sunglasses, talking about bands across the ocean, the girls who wanted to be older and the fashion. This is a happy sad movie, that will keep you tapping and asking why aren't all movies like this. The script is very very smart, the casting couldn't be wiser. Lucy Boynton does an amazing job. The art direction is so precise you can imagine the smell of the flats. The awesome cars. What a great movie!!",/review/rw3634498/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2017,lesleyharris30,9," A Heartwarming Film that is Ridiculous Fun,
","Sing Street is an outstanding movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is a real feel good, sweet movie that is a pure delight for anyone familiar with the eighties, the setting and atmosphere makes it convey very clear that we are in a very different time in Ireland. The original songs are magnificent, each one being annoyingly catchy and serving the plot very well. It is immensely funny, but also stands out in more dramatic moments that are mildly tense, and very real. ",/review/rw3634498/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2016,Gordon-11,," Enjoyable, and great music too!
","This film tells the story of a young man in a troubled family, whose parents are breaking up. He is bullied in school and basically is a nobody, until he decides to form a band to attract a mysterious orphan girl.",/review/rw3634498/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2022,norbert-plan-618-715813,9," Brilliant
","A choral film about high school students who form a band. The film is also musical in the sense that it tells us how school friends make music by creating and trying to make this group, the Sing Street, live. This allows them to attract girls. And makes them a little more mature and confident. Because they are students who are the whipping boys of the teachers and the other students at the beginning.",/review/rw3634498/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2016,lee_eisenberg,9," band of Ireland
","If you only hear about John Carney's ""Sing Street"" you might think that it has the same story as ""The Commitments"". They do have similar plots but go in their own directions. This one incorporates the theme of the bullied kid. In this case, a boy gets moved to a new school in 1980s Dublin and starts a band. The movie at once serves as a coming-of-age story and also a look at its era. The mom mentions that Ireland doesn't allow divorce (it now does).",/review/rw3634498/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2016,Quinoa1984,8," a real sweet heart of a movie, but with actual edge and, most importantly, good rock songs!
","This movie reminds me how much I miss music videos from a time when all a band needed was themselves and a good looking chick. And with the exception of that syrupy ballad near the end. Sincere and heartfelt in the best ways, genuinely funny (at times), and has a great message for young people who want to find away to express the bad things going on their lives. Maybe not the most original message, but it's told well and these young actors are good at selling it (I also liked the main kid's brother very much, sort of like an Irish Chris Pratt from Parks & Rec).",/review/rw3634498/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2016,SnoopyStyle,8," sweet coming-of-age
","It's 80's Dublin. Economy is bad and everybody is leaving for London. Conor Lawlor's parents are cutting back on costs and he's forced to attend the Christian Brothers School on Synge Street. He's picked on by school bully Barry Bray and Brother Baxter insists on black shoes. He's befriended by diminutive Darren Mulvey. He gets aspiring model Raphina to be his video vixen. Now, all he needs is a band so that he can shoot the video. His older brother has such sage advise as ""No woman can truly love a man who listens to Phil Collins."" and be ""Happy-Sad"".",/review/rw3634498/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2017,Screen_Blitz,9," Sing Street is upbeat, charming, and sensational for music fans everywhere
","This teen musical dramedy paints the nostalgia of classic teen flicks from the 80s, and arguably the early days of teen musicals like 'Grease'. Most importantly, it is almost exactly what a teen-oriented musical piece needs to be. It is funny, it is charming, it is upbeat, and it boasts a cast of characters that are thoroughly likable; not to mention the exhilarating musical numbers that take place. Jim Carney, the man behind the dramedy 'Begin Again' is the conductor behind this project. Carney is a genius who captures the innocence of youth and the thoughtful wonders of following your dreams. Although some may consider this just your average high school musical comedy, this claim feels a bit of an understatement. In the age where the teen musical genre is long past its hay days from the late 70s and 80s, this is one of those rare flicks of the genre that really works. Set in 1985 Dublin, this follows 14-year old Conor (played by Ferdia Walsh-Peelo), a misunderstood high school teenager stuck in his broken home life with his bickering parents and his lazy older brother Brendan (played by Jack Reynor). Upon meeting a cute model Raphina (played by Lucy Boynton), Conor forms a rock band with a group of outcasts including Eamon (played by Mark McKenna), Ngig (played by Percy Chamburuka), Larry (played by Conor Hamilton), Garry (played by Karl Rice), and Barry (played by Ian Kenny) in efforts to impress her.",/review/rw3634498/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I saw your nomination for the best comedy\music movie of the year at the Golden Globes, Sing Street attracted my interest, so I decided to watch, I found a medium movie, the cast is competent, Ferdia Walsh- Peelo is an actor to stay with. Eye, Lucy Boynton, Jack Reynor, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Aidan Gillen and etc, the direction of John Carney is good, the soundtrack is excellent, the photography is very good, I liked the 1 act, the dialogues are good, there are some Very good characters in the film, but I found the pace slow, even the movie being very short, I expected more from Sing Street, plus I quite enjoyed the first act of the movie, and the cast that is very competent.
