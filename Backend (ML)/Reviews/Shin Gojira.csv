2 April 2020,Aaron1375,6," These girls were less stupid than the ones in the first film at least.
","I thought this sequel was a bit better than the first film. A bit more action, lots more chomping and the girls were not as stupid. I mean, the first film, they purposely go in a rusty cage amid great white sharks. Here, they go to what is almost a lake with not a shark in sight, so they kind of got caught off guard more. Don't get me wrong, they were still stupid, just not as much so. With the budget they had, they did a fairly decent job too and the film actually turned a decent profit so I would not be surprised if they made a third, though not sure what they could do next.",/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,4," It's fun in small doses, but generally disappointing.
","If like me, you were lured in by the trailer, which to be fair for those of us that like shark movies, even though they're nearly all terrible, you can be forgiven for thinking this one would be different....",/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2019,bbretall-1,4," Look out! Blind cave sharks who are also apparently deaf.
","The basic plot is a group of teenage girls go diving in a submerged Aztec city only to find it is infested with giant blind cave sharks (note the white eye on the shark on the poster). The sharks must also be deaf because they fail to home in on the noisy teens on multiple occasions.
This is basically a ""last girl"" slasher film with all the jump scares and stupidity, but the slasher is replaced with sharks.
They have full face mask scuba gear with radios so we can hear them whimper, cry, and scream throughout the last 2/3rds of the movie.
The characters die in a fairly predictable order and nothing particularly surprising happens until near the end when they amp up the crazy stuff in an attempt to add to the tension.
The very end was pretty ridiculous.... I almost wish they had ditched the ""Hollywood ending"" and gone with what would have happened to the characters had the final action events really occurred.
Had the filmmakers just taken a step back and decided to not make the movie so formulaic with a bit more attention to not being so unrealistic as to break the suspension of disbelief it would have been a far better movie.",/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2020,FeastMode,1," hilariously awful... watch if you enjoy laughing at bad movies
",This movie is a hilariocity (shout out to stuckmann). 8/10 on the hilariocity scale. i had a pretty great time with the movie. i went in planning on giving it a legit chance. i was laughing within the first 5 minutes.,/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2020,Leofwine_draca,3," Interminable underwater scenes
","I wasn't particularly impressed by the first 47 METERS DOWN but this sequel, UNCAGED, is the real pits (no pun intended). There's no cage diving this time around, just an all-female group of annoyances who decide to go diving in a remote beauty spot only to discover that a number of sinister sharks are intent on having them for breakfast, lunch and tea. The idea has potential, as do most monster flisks, but it's the shoddy execution that really lets this one down. The viewer sits through the boring set-up with the block-headed protagonists (Stallone's daughter among them), only to then have to put up with an hour of interminable underwater shaky-cam scenes which boil down to jump scares and little else.",/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2019,jtkirk161,2," OMG
",A blind shark that evolved in a few hundred years? Woman with no scuba experience go cave diving? People survive direct shark attacks? They used 80 % of their air on the way in but thought they stood a chance swimming back out the same way? This would be a flop on Scfi.,/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2020,wonkru,7," I like it
","Those who have high expectations are wrong here. But if you know what you will be getting involved with for the next 1,5 hours, then this movie is not bad at all, also the ending.",/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2019,ThomasDrufke,6," Way Better Than it Has Any Right to Be
","I truly had no interest in seeing this film, with little marketing and a first film that by no means was deserving a sequel. However, with a fresh new cast and not much else out in theaters this past weekend, I thought I might as well give it a shot. Following in the footsteps of many other blockbuster style films this summer, 47 Meters Down: Uncaged is a harmlessly thrilling sequel that cares much more about its scares than it does in developing characters, but that's not really what you go to these movies looking for. Paced out well with tension that never seems to end, I couldn't help but be entertained by this sequel. Heck, I'll take another few of these. Shark movies always seem to have a great deal of appeal.",/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2019,Calicodreamin,8," Amazingly Intense
","This was seriously so intense, the shark scenes are crazy! I spent the whole movie on the edge of my seat. The beginning lead up to get the girls into the shark situation didn't take up too long and was fairly credible. Then the shark shows up and it's utter insanity until the end of the movie. There's a scene with a flashing red light and the sharks are circling, was so suspenseful I could barely breath. Action packed to the very last second. Top notch.",/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2019,tresm87,7," A fun sequel that has some tremendous visual bite to it, an effective enough story, and serves as the summer's signature shark film.
","The first film; 47 meters down was a simplistic well executed shark survival film that had enough going for it to be a solid entry into the depths of shark films albeit cliche.
This adds more intensity with a faster pace and some more action/scares throughout. Director Johannes Roberts clearly had a bigger budget as he was able to have much better set pieces and expanded settings in the underwater cave ruins and it works very well for the overall story and atmosphere. The actors may not be upper echelon, but they serve their purpose for the story. The colors and visuals are phenomenal and the cgi sharks look a lot better this time around. There are even some unexpected moments you won't see coming that i commend them for attempting. Overall a pretty enjoyable shark film with a terrific original setting concept that amplifies the intensity.",/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2019,hegeolsen,2," The masks
","This destroyed the movie for me: they had diving masks on, and they talked to eachother throughout the movie. BUT, the ears were outside the masks and NO ear plugs. How is it possible to hear anything then? And don't get me started on the underwater music!",/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2019,SnoopyStyle,5," underwater thriller

27 October 2019,kevxzara,1," Blind sharks!!!
","Blind sharks give me a break if they evolved like this they would of been dead years ago due to no food supply as I only see 2 fish down in the tomb.
2 girls get bit in the rib cage and survive get real that's just so far fetched.
This movie is so far fetched it breaks all knowledge of sharks and turns it into a sharknado movie.
To far fetched for me by far, and just stupid and silly.",/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2019,ymyuseda,4," Bad Underwater Scenes
","Rating 4.0/10
The first time i've seen the trailer i thought the movie would be amazing and full of thrilling scenes, unfortunetly i was wrong. The acting in it are mediocre and falls short of satisfaction. Not only that, the storyline not as good as i hoped. Truly bad shark movie.",/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2019,NeverBeTheOneToBlindlyFollow,7," A fun watch with decent scares.
",My nephews 9 and 16 loved it. I liked it a lot and would probably watch it again. It's one that is best in a theater like setting like the first one in my opinion. The scares are more effective in a theater setting due to that it does rely on a decent amount of jump scares. But and it's a big but... they are placed well and aren't cheap jumps. You jump for a reason and not just a noise so they're done right and effectively in my opinion. But it has plenty of scary moments and situations that aren't cheap jump scares. You can't call the jumps like you can in other movies and that's what makes it refreshing.,/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2019,bigbadbassface,7," What you want but how can they hear?
","Exactly what you expect. Only annoying part was they conversed freely but had no earpieces, their ears were exposed to open water. Minor but very distracting detail",/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2019,pal05052003,8," A combination of Descent and Crawl, absent the character depth, but delivers on relentless suspense and scares
","47 Meters Down : Uncaged is like a mix between the Descent and Crawl. Like Descent, we have several women exploring caves, get trapped, and meet a killer creature, however, it lacks the character depth that makes Descent more impactful. As for Crawl, this movie involves flooded enclosed spaces, and near brushes with killer creature. Also similar to Crawl, the characters progress through different set pieces until the very ending. Despite the lack of character depth, the movie delivers more than it is supposed to. The underwater cave scenes are very claustrophobic. The shots are immersive and makes you hold your breathe even when there are no sharks around. The sharks are eerily frightening. They are huge, realistic, and since they are cave sharks, their unique look make them even more frightening. The movie also uses sound and light strobes to generate discomfort. Such as the scenes with flashlights (it is an underwater cave after all, so no spoilers there), and sound. It also wastes no time to set the scene for the story. Once the action begins, the pacing is relentless. In fact, this movie keeps you on edge till the very last minute. The claustrophic camera shots accentuate the danger, making you feel that danger can lurk any corner, and we are as clueless as the characters on where to find safety. While the ending may be a bit far fetched but it shows that even in the final moments of the movie, the danger does not let up. I really recommend this movie.",/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2022,richkiel,1," Unwatchable
","When you go to see a film like this, you know it's trash. But even trash can have decent entertainment value. This is a bunch of annoying girls swimming in murky water, with a shark boogeyman showing up pretty much when you expect him to. Characters are interchangeable and annoying, you can't even remember their names. Nor do you have a reason to, because they are just shark food. And to say that the ending insults intelligence is a colossal understatement.",/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2019,Vanessydelg,4," Telepathy and a shark
","Apparently, these braindead girls are gifted with Telepathy since they can speak to each other and hear and listen to one another without earpods, or any significant gear for such action. I suppose that if you decide to overlook this "" minor"" detail and a few other insults to the intellect, meaning if you shut you brain off, you might enjoy the scares and, of course, root for the shark.",/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2019,patsulli99,7," I mean.......what more do you want?
","I didn't expect this movie to be good.
In fact I went and saw it specifically to see a bad, entertaining movie but I was pleasantly surprised. Don't get me wrong this isn't a good movie but for what it is, can you really ask for more?",/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2021,clairelouise5,9," Claustrophobic hell
",If you like The Descent you need to watch this. I was cringing in my seat with my hand over my mouth for the duration. It was claustrophobic to the extreme. A scary horror film. And just as good as the first.,/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2020,kosmasp,5," Architecture
","They really went far out to make something, to build a world, to really have something underground. Though once the mayhem starts nothing much is left of that. Still I would do a tour of the set if I ever was going to do deep diving (minus the sharks obviously).",/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2019,billybacktown,2," Zero common sense
","It's a shark movie. Can't expect much. That said tried really hard just letting this movie be what it was but it's just so stupid. I said ""pfffffffff"" no less than 15 times. The decision making from the writers that lead to the chain of events throughout the film is laughable. Wouldn't recommend.",/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv

17 August 2019,rstearns54,8," Turn off your brain, and it's actually a good movie
","If you go into this movie looking for anything other than dumb, popcorn entertainment. Turn off your brain and don't think about the plot holes. I did, and I ended up really enjoying it. It was actually one of the scariest movies that I've seen in a long time. Let me start off by saying that I'm mildly claustrophobic and just the premise of being trapped in an underwater cave with the entrance blocked had me my skin crawling. But the jump scares were effective, too. And they didn't try to justify the silliness with science or anything else. They just leaned into it. I would suggest anyone seeing this movie do the same.",/review/rw5064202/?ref_=tt_urv
