18 November 2010,madbandit20002000,9," A Skinamax film meets a Lifetime film meets a Kevin Smith film
","On the surface, ""Women In Trouble"", the fifth film from Sebastian Guitterez (""Rise""; co-wrote ""Snakes On A Plane"") looks like your typical sex comedy, packed with attractive, well-endowed dames. It does have the dames, but they-and the film-are surprisingly three-dimensional and quaint, making the film a must-see.",/review/rw2613426/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2010,fung0,10," Wow.
","Women in Trouble is not an exploitation film, or even a parody of one. It's a remarkably clever, literate, surreal comedy-drama that just happens to be set in a daffy world inspired by the culture of trashy porn. Like Pulp Fiction, it twines together a number of overheated and seemingly disconnected narratives. But the comparison is totally unfair - to Tarantino, who, for all his cleverness, will never make a movie as emotionally involving as this one. Or as funny.",/review/rw2613426/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2011,aimless-46,8," Better Than the Reviews Indicate
","True to its title, 2009's ""Women In Trouble"" is about a bunch of women in an assortment of trouble. The film begins with two women inside a Mexican jail, which turns out to be a film-with-a-film parody sequence of an exploitation movie. You eventually realize that the whole 90 minute feature is self-reflexive parody; although much more subtle than the opening.",/review/rw2613426/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2010,ilikegreatmovies,9," Hilarious and Endearing, An Unexpected Treasure
","I honestly did not see much potential in ""Women In Trouble,"" but I decided to rent it and I wish I had made it out to the theaters for it. This is a wonderful film that employs the technique of multiple story lines to perfection. The film makes you laugh much more than expected, but keeps its heart in the midst of all the appropriately titled trouble. It's too real to just become a comedy or a tragedy or a drama, this film is an intoxicating blur of emotions. On top of all this is a phenomenal cast. If ""Women In Trouble"" gave you that hesitant feeling it gave me when I first heard of it, then ignore it and take a risk this one is well worth it!",/review/rw2613426/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2010,imdb-5096,8," Entertaining and smart movie, worshiping the female power
","This movie has porn stars in it. This can only be cheesy, right?",/review/rw2613426/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2010,chickenpuss,7," What was that!
","I'm not really sure what I saw because this film was a composite of so many different elements. This film was listed under the comedy section from my television video provider. I was unfamiliar with the director, but some of the critiques form IMDb I found interesting, so I gave it a shot. I really believe this director, has a lot of potential. There were some great mise-en-scene; especially the use of rapid fire editorial to punctuate. I was really impressed by the acting, the direction was good, and the script great as well. I laughed and cried, however what really irked me was a lack of cohesion between the disparate vignettes; at times I wondered who edited this movie...other than this pretty good, plus Robyn Hitchcock was involved with the sound track, and this is the first film I have ever see where he contributed. I have been listening to his music for 20 years!",/review/rw2613426/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2012,itamar-c,10," An amazing movie
","This is my first review and my English is very poor so I won't say much. I bought this DVD some time ago along with other ones and I never cared about watching it.. so, maybe just to convince myself I didn't spent my money for nothing, I decided to give it a chance. OK, I just finished watching it right now, and I have to say I'm completely astonished. This movie is brilliant. It's clever, smart, fun, touching.. it made me laugh and it made me cry. I'll definitely watch it again soon and I'll recommend it to as many people as I can. I won't say more because as I said my English isn't good and I don't want to mess things up, but I can say this movie just become one of my all-time favorites.",/review/rw2613426/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2012,AvidClimber,8," Women in Trouble — Hot, interesting, open-minded, and at time quirky medley of lives

","This is one of those movies you find accidentally and then want to run out and tell all your friends to watch!I saw it last night at a special screening and went in expecting to be mildly entertained.Boy,was I in for a surprise. The story is a comic delight,the acting superb and the feeling when it was over made us all stand and applaud.",/review/rw2613426/?ref_=tt_urv

3 April 2011,moonspinner55,6," Unblinking, unblushing female portraits...
","Sebastian Gutierrez wrote, produced, and directed this very frisky, funny look at a group of women, gay and straight, living in modern-day Los Angeles, centering on a conflicted porn star who has recently found out she's pregnant. The filmmaker (who has previously worked with Pedro Almodóvar) is fearless in delineating these sexual ruminations, some of which are truly out-there; he has also managed to gain the confidence of his eclectic cast, many of whom give superlative performances. Obviously not for all tastes but, for open-minded viewers, a comedic and dramatic challenge--accompanied by a nasty tickle. Final interview scene (after the end-credits) is especially funny. **1/2 from ****",/review/rw2613426/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2010,lewiskendell,5," A serviceable way to see a lot of hot women in under two hours.
","FULL DISCLOSURE: I freely admit that the only reason I wanted to see Women in Trouble was because of the incredible number of blindingly hot women that are in it. Carla Gugino, Marley Shelton, Emmanuelle Chriqui, Adrianne Palicki, Cameron Richardson...do I really need to continue? I had little interest in whatever the movie was supposed to be ""about"", per se, I just wanted to see the hotties. And they did deliver the goods. ",/review/rw2613426/?ref_=tt_urv

","We already know that people from los angeles are seriously messed up in the head and the head....none of these women are in trouble but are creating trouble wherever they go...as usual there is scant scent of a theme and plot...producers, writers and directors that are the same person should desist from wasting money on such drivel for absolutely no one to watch....if it wasn't for carla gugino's breasts this film wouldn't have got out of the edit room",/review/rw2613426/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2012,dimarinc,7," A Surprisingly Solid Film from Start to Finish
","I had some apprehension before watching Women in Trouble. It seemed like a girly film but I decided to watch it because of the cast. The end result was a very unique and impressive movie. It definitely has cult classic potential as the fine balance of comedy, odd situations and comedy is top notch. The way that it intertwines stories and plots is a gentle effect but does a great job of drawing attention and provoking thought throughout the movie. The story disperses between several key characters, many of which are porn stars or flight attendants. They all have issues that are mainly man (or should I say partner) related.

8 January 2012,fedor8,," Points off for the soppy drama and for sticking your talent-free daughter/niece into the movie.

12 January 2016,SnoopyStyle,6," indie of interconnected characters
",Elektra Luxx (Carla Gugino) is an L.A. porn actress who is horrified to find she's pregnant from rocker Nick Chapel (Josh Brolin). Nick dies in an airplane washroom having sex with flight attendant Cora (Marley Shelton). Elektra gets stuck in an elevator with Doris (Connie Britton). Doris admits to having a baby with her meth-dealing crazy boyfriend. He got arrested and she left her baby with her sister Addy. Addy has taken Charlotte as her own daughter. Charlotte is in therapy with Dr. Maxine McPherson (Sarah Clarke). Abby is having an affair with her husband Travis (Simon Baker). Holly Rocket (Adrianne Palicki) is a fellow porn actress who does work with call-girl Bambi (Emmanuelle Chriqui).

5 October 2021,ksf-2,6," takes a long time to get going
","I recognize the names josh brolin and joseph gordon levitt in the credits, but that's about it. Everyone here has communication issues. Secrets. Problems. And the little girl in a psychiatrist session seems to have the best handle on her emotions of anyone. Porn stars fleeing. Flight attendants and dead passengers. About halfway through (48 minutes), things start to connect... just a little tiny bit. Lots of random lines, wacky, zany interactions between people. Some funny, some tragic. And we only see JGL in the last two minutes. Written and directed by Sebastian Gutierrez. It's okay. Was expecting more. I wanted a real connection to tie all the characters together, but it doesn't really happen. Meh.",/review/rw2613426/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2011,Buddy-51,6," too clever by half but has some good moments
","An odd but strangely compelling indie comedy, ""Women in Trouble"" does just what the title suggests; it puts an assortment of lovely ladies into humorously dire predicaments. Two women, Connie Britton (""Friday Night Lights"") and the newly pregnant porn star Elektra (Carla Gogina), are stuck together in a stalled elevator; Adrianne Palicki (also of ""Friday Night Lights"") and Emmanuelle Chrichi are sex workers who witness a crime and have to run to safety; Sarah Clarke (""24"") is a therapist whose husband (""The Mentalist""'s Simon Baker) is having an affair with one of her patients; and Marley Shelton is an engaged stewardess who's unfortunate enough to have the rock star (Josh Brolin) who's performing sex on her in the airplane bathroom die when the plane hits turbulence. The story lines, which seem disparate at first glance, do manage to dovetail into one another by movie's end.",/review/rw2613426/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2014,RavenGlamDVDCollector,2," Sexy Women in Trouble
","What is this movie? It looks like a middle-somewhere episode of an adult TV series. It is not particularly good, but then again, it is watchable, and there are some gloriously beautiful actresses in it, but I have to hold firm and sink it with a low score, because it is such a shambles going nowhere. I only checked out one of the IMDb reviews just now and was surprised to see that it was gloriously positive. This thing has the appearance of being an experimental film, a practice run of filming something without a real script, just loose ideas to see what you can come up with... And then they went and released it. If you are expecting a real story, steer clear. If you wanna see pretty actresses, well, gee, there's one here, that masseuse, she is, like, wow! All I'd ever want for Christmas and I promise to be a good boy forever! Get the picture? BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE SEEN THESE PRETTY ACTRESSES IN PROPER MOVIES OR SOAP OPERAS not this junky thing, AND THAT'S MY POINT and I challenge anybody to disagree with this one. I think this has been my most straightforward review of the lot, double quick time, and really, really helpful, you'd better believe it!",/review/rw2613426/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2010,cinephiliac,4," Dumb, brash and pointless but unfortunately doesn't know it.
","This film is entirely watchable if all you want is some attractive wallpaper to scroll across your television for 90 minutes. If you're looking for a smart pulpy film with a witty script and entertaining cut and paste plot, then this is not it, and you'd be best advised to avoid like the plague.",/review/rw2613426/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2011,MBunge,4," Needed less talk, any action.
","There's a lot to like about this movie, but by the end it left me exhausted and more than a little boredand not just because its lack of plot left it sputtering to an anti-climactic ending. Women in Trouble repeats the same narrative dynamic over and over and over again until it has wrung every bit of dramatic juice out, leaving behind a dry and twisted up story that desperately needs a jolt of something to keep the viewer engaged.",/review/rw2613426/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2010,Aiki40,7," Very good!
","Very good comedy, really. No stars (except Josh Brolin) I mean no Sex& City or Desperate housewife's stars.. and good. That's works! It's funny. Really I enjoy. I don't want to write about storyline.. but if you have some time and desire watch something not to heavy, but smart and funny - it's for your mood. I watch this movie when I working.. after 5 min. I stop working and start watch more careful. It' s second thing after ""Ten Inch Hero"" which is great. No special effect, great dialogue, no shooting, no big budget. You can compare to ""Sex, lies and videotapes"" - same class. My recommendation.. I like movies like this one.",/review/rw2613426/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2012,mistabobdobolina,3," Whiskey. Tango. Foxtrot.
","Rather incredibly, Gutierrez marketed this movie as giving women in Hollywood more interesting things to do than be ""the good girlfriend"" or ""the bad girlfriend."" Well, technically that's true. For example, a third of women in a Gutierrez film can apparently be hookers-with-a-heart-of-gold. Yet more of them can be sexually-available flight attendants and masseuses. A smaller fraction get to be ostensible professionals of some (usually unspecified) kind... although actually all of their story lines turn out to revolve around men, which is only true of one of each among the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold and sexually-available service-industry types, so I guess Advantage: Team Hooker there. Oh, and there's room for a precocious child in there, too, who's like all totally quirky and stuff.",/review/rw2613426/?ref_=tt_urv
