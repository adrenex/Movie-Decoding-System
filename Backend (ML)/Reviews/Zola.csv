6 January 2023,mattpavan,3," It's basically the ""I'm a celebrity get me out of here"" show
",Same format as the SAS shows. Mostly a bunch of whining ex-celebrities with zero chance of completing the course no business being on it to start with.,/review/rw8801918/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,rwall-15147,1," What a joke
","It's a shame that they apply the term ""Special Forces"" Training to this, because not one of these celebrities could handle Air Force Basic Training let alone special forces. Sure they may be doing some (or modified) special forces tasks, but in no way is it even remotely close to what it's like. Even the ""Athletes"" on the show would not be able to handle even a taste of what real soldiers had to endure. I feel embarrassed for the training officers as they themselves must think the candidates are just a joke. Next time they want to tackle a show like this, pick some candidates that are in good shape and are not constantly crying.",/review/rw8801918/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2023,danmunger15,1," Not close
","Not even close to being a special forces show. The celebrities are all whining and complaining and supposedly getting hurt too easily. It is not challenging enough. Are these celebrities really wanting to be there or they're just collecting a paycheck? There continues to be a back story every time they are breaking down and crying. Reality shows are fake and ridiculous, and yet they keep coming out with them. I had to stop watching after the first 20 minutes. I couldn't take anymore. They didn't even show everybody jumping out of the helicopter, Only the ones that were fear of falling or drowning.",/review/rw8801918/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,frankie-08908,6," It's Not Bad
",First let me set some of the previous reviewers straight. Just because an athlete retired doesn't make that athlete washed up. EVERYONE RETIRES. Danny Amendola is a 2x Super Bowl Champion. Dwight Howard is an NBA Champion and has an Olympic gold medal. The other athletes on the show are just as accomplished. Show respect for these incredible athletes.,/review/rw8801918/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,kgborrell-34146,1," This is bad
","This is just bad. This is not special forces, this is not even air force level hard. Bunch of washed up celebrities and the other half are a bunch of washed up nobodies. I mean at least get some decently in shape celebs to do this. They are never in any danger. They are treated with kid gloves. After a short jog and a 10 foot drop out of a helicopter half of them are breaking down. Send them through REAL military training then see how they would do. Painful to watch for anyone who has ever been in the military. For the average person I'm sure they will think this is really hard stuff. Don't waste your time.",/review/rw8801918/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,ssq-91292,1," Booooo!! üçÖüçÖ
","I was extremely disappointed by the lack of true grit and determination displayed by the contestants. Instead of pushing through and rising to the challenge, they were preoccupied with complaining and making excuses. The exercises they were given were far too easy and did not even come close to true special forces training standards. The selection of contestants was also questionable and many of them were not physically or mentally prepared for the task at hand. Overall, this show was a huge disappointment and not worth your time. I recommend watching ""The Selection"" on the History channel instead.",/review/rw8801918/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,bmfortier,8," Highly Entertaining
","Something has always fascinated me about training tier-one units such as Delta Force and the SAS. Beyond just the intensity of the exercises, there is something that exposes the grit, determination, and inner character of the people willing to put themselves through treacherous conditions to become part of a tight-knit, war-fighting team.",/review/rw8801918/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,mammajammaAH,10," Actually really enjoy this one
","We're actually really enjoying this show more than most reality shows out there. I appreciate the rawness of much of it. Yes, we don't know who many of these celebrities are, but they are showing you who they are. They are people too just like you and I. Some of them have shown their crappy sides right away, but some are also beginning to show their true grit and its pretty cool to watch. (You have to remember, its still a reality show.) I could not do half the things they are doing and overcoming on this show! It also makes us appreciate our true special forces more as well! Looking forward to more!",/review/rw8801918/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,tt-rs,1," A Total Waste of Time
","I've never seen a show this poorly scripted.... The narrator is more effective than a sleeping pill. They should change the name of the show to ""Celebrity Whiners"" or better yet ""Celebrity Quitters"".... I'm not sure what Fox was thinking when they approved this show.... I actually made it through 4 episodes but I'm done.... I can't take it anymore.... The celebrities on this show must be extremely desperate for attention and money to be associated with such crap.... There's way too many good shows out there to watch.... They should have asked Taylor Sheridan for input as he has the right formula.... I think I will watch more Yellowstone reruns.",/review/rw8801918/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,jensonseifert,9," Surprisingly Educational
","I love that this show exposes my own deep rooted issues and inspires me to challenge myself to do hard things, to be uncomfortable, and to possibly move towards change. A quick note: the arm chair quarterbacks giving this one star are only doing so because in their delusional world, they think they could do better than olympians. This show is unique and honest. These ""celebs"" have agreed to be yelled at, disrespected, and put in incredibly harsh and difficult conditions. Sleeping on a cot with crap for food is, in itself, a serious ask for any of us watching from home. There's a reason people dropped out in the first day. It's because 108 degree heat causes a two mile jog to be devestating. I think this show is great and I would love to see more of it. Yes, some participants are ridiculous (Nastia) but most are on a personal and real journey and they have allowed us to witness it. How cool is that!",/review/rw8801918/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2023,pckjvqcz,6," It's okay
","The show is just okay. I was excited to learn why these celebrities went on, but feel some gave up too early. The blond gymnast was super whiny and wimpy and I was very glad when she left. The British narrator voice is annoying and difficult to understand. The ""yes staff"" is annoying as well. Why can't they just say ""yes sir"". Obviously they can't put in real special forces training, a lot of these people aren't fit to hardly get up the cliff. I imagine it is similar in the mental difficulty, for where these people are coming from anyway. Overall it is just okay, but I feel there are many ways they can improve.",/review/rw8801918/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,windwzrd,6," Literally taking washed ups and sending them through the ringer....
","I would love to see a bunch of the S. F take on these skills with the winners of the guys that do the world's fitness people..and see who is actually tougher none of the S. F remotely fit yet all the fitness guys are shredded, see if shredded rips dad bods....just saying..I truly believe if this was actually hard a bunch of celebrities especially age 40 and above wouldn't come close to being able to do really any of them, let alone 10 days repel and such one thing but the stuff I remember doesn't come close to that it literally slapped you silly daily and most was weapon related over standard p.t stuff anyways let put the fitest against the finest....",/review/rw8801918/?ref_=tt_urv
