26 August 2008,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," ""Now that's entertainment!""
","I wasn't looking for anything deep, I wasn't looking for anything serious, no Oscar winning actors, no award winning script, I just wanted an action movie, this summer we got Death Race, a movie where the script and characters are just never explored, but the action is non stop and so exciting. I don't know why, but we just need action movies like that and one of the things that I did enjoy about this was that it reminded me of those old grind house films that have quick editing and fast paced stories that are just awesome stories to watch because of the stunts. This is a different form of The Fast and The Furious, only just not with all the fancy gadgets which I like. Also, Jason Statham, this guy is just awesome in action movies, he makes such a great lead in any action role and is such an awesome tough guy that you don't want to mess with.",/review/rw1963286/?ref_=tt_urv

","2012 the economy has hit bottom, broke through and has kept on descending. Along the way prisons have been handed over to the private sector that have chosen to make a profit by broadcasting gladiatorial style death matches starring the inmates, with the reward to the inmates after 5 victories  FREEDOM Enter Jensen Ames (Jason Stratham) a recently unemployed steel worker and former race car driver who lost his license but no matter how bad things are, he's a happy man as long as he has his family.",/review/rw1963286/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," I enjoyed this movie
","A massive departure from the original, Death Race keeps the cars and kills and forgoes virtually everything else from 2000. Fun in a very different manner, but still fun, and that's what counts.",/review/rw1963286/?ref_=tt_urv

23 August 2008,A_Roode,6," Fun, very loud and unabashedly dumb.
","I shouldn't write reviews for movies like this because it feels like I'm lining up to kick a puppy. A movie like 'Death Race' can only be judged fairly through a set of lowered genre expectations. I'll try but I'm not making any promises. It is fun, very loud and unabashedly dumb. It was never envisioned to be anything other than an attempt at 'cool.' The average viewer will - without fail - be able to pick out every moment where Paul W.S. Anderson had an idea during the script writing and thought to himself ""That'd be awesome!"" before looking around the room for someone to high five. I shouldn't pick on him because I actually do enjoy his movies. He isn't trying to make 'Casablanca'; 'Robocop' is more his style. Just without the boring stuff like characterization and development. And as little subtlety, satire or nuance as needed. Unless unintentional or totally by mistake and ironic -- That'd be alright.",/review/rw1963286/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2008,wordmonkey,8," Fun, Fun, FUN!
","Now here's an exploitation film that knows what a solid B-movie is supposed to be: an action-dense, amped-up, gore-soaked killfest. It's the cinematic equivalent of eating that entire box of Red Vines you bought at the snack bar, using them as candy straws to suck down your extra-large Coke.",/review/rw1963286/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2008,helmutty,6," The death race!
","As many comic books, games and original movies are being remade, director Paul W.S. Anderson is not new to those remakes. He adapted Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat and AVP. Now he remakes the original movie Death race 2000. Not surprising. While watching this movie, I realised that he still has his habit of making games plots. Death race plot is quite similar to those racing or survival games plot. It reminds me of DOA (Dead Or Alive) which Paul produce. ",/review/rw1963286/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2009,ccthemovieman-1,8," Despite All The Prison Clichés, It Was An Entertaining Film
","Regardless of the politically-correct finish to this film and the predictable prison stereotypes, this was a fun film to watch simply because it entertained. It was a good diversion, filled with total nonsense mayhem and testosterone-gone-wild. In other words, this was a typical Jason Statham film. No matter how many of these ultra-macho men he plays, he gets away with it with charm and likability.",/review/rw1963286/?ref_=tt_urv

16 November 2009,ma-cortes,6," Jason Statham as assertive and charismatic convict in a televised death race
","The picture is set in the near future (2012), there the ultimate sporting is the Death Race where contestants get score points for running drivers down and sacrificing themselves. It's a futurist international sport , a violent and bloody car race where the drivers score points for hitting other vehicles. Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is the hero behind the wheel, posing as Frankestein, and his nemesis the various killers drivers. He's a good guy wrongly accused of killing and locked on Terminal island. Jensen is coerced by warden Hennessey(Joan Allen) to enter Death Race , a gladiator-like televised fight-to death. A race against dangerous prisoner-drivers, as Machine Gun Mason (Tyrese Gibson), Pachenko (Max Ryan), Gunner (Jacob Vargas) and several others (Robin Shou, Robert LaSardo). Jensen is helped by coach (Ian McShane) and accompanied by a gorgeous eye-popping youngster (a sexy girl Natalie Martinez).",/review/rw1963286/?ref_=tt_urv

10 July 2011,KineticSeoul,7," A blend of ""Mario Kart"" and ""Twisted Metal"" and it's a solid fun thrill ride
","If ""Mario Kart"" was a movie and it had characters similar to the video game ""Twisted Metal"" this movie would be it. I really don't see why critics bash this movie so much, yes it isn't a Oscar worthy movie nor is it a very intelligent movie. But it sure is entertaining and was so stupid to the point it got irritating. People that decide to see this movie should know what they are getting into or else they might dislike it. Overall when I saw this movie in theater I really enjoyed it and had a blast with it, sure some of the plot holes are obvious but this is still a solid thrill ride. Personally I had a blast with this movie and Jason Statham was good in this role since he fit in with his tough guy exterior and I bought it. There is good amount of sex appeal and Ian McShane is just right as well while playing the character named Coach. This is a thrill ride that is like watching a actually entertaining video game movie. However if the script was a bit more intelligent it would have been better though although I didn't expect a solid script from Paul W.S. Anderson.",/review/rw1963286/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2009,lastliberal,7," I'm the f*cking reaper baby. You can burn me, you can even f*cking shoot me but you just can motherfucking kill me!
","There is no one I would rather see in an action movie than Jason Statham. Put him behind the wheel of a car and you have a formula for thrills and excitement that cannot be beat, even if it is on a track that resembles the boring NASCAR.",/review/rw1963286/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2008,mgayles2005,8," ""Death Race"" a lot of death, some racing, and a lot of fun.
","""Death Race"" puts me in a moral dilemma. Its deliberately trashy, shallow and inept, and for some reason I still like it. Making my feelings even more conflicted is the fact that it was directed by Paul W.S Anderson, a director who tries to turn movies into video games, and always fails. But as they say in Hollywood ""you're only as good as your last picture"" so Anderson is as good as anyone right now.",/review/rw1963286/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2009,Jonny_Numb,1," Defecation Race
","Jason Statham plays one type of character, but he almost always plays it to perfection: the suave, stubbly, and sometimes smarmy would-be Bond from madcap B movies like ""Crank"" and ""Ghosts of Mars."" Casting him as the lead in any film brings certain expectationsbasically, that our muscled mofo will deliver a smackdown to the badguys while delivering some catchy one-liners.",/review/rw1963286/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2008,bobsgrock,5," Expect little, get even less.
","Going into this movie, for reasons I cannot explain, I didn't expect to really see anything that resembles the usual quality films I try to only watch. I have seen Jason Statham in The Italian Job and The Bank Job and liked both of those. I think he needs to stick to caper films rather than over-the top action movies that may have a sleek look to them, but have ultimately no plot and no reason to see them. Statham plays a former hardcore car racer who is trying to live straight, but ends up in a huge jail after being framed for his wife's murder. He is then drawn into the Death Race, an Internet phenomenon showcasing wild prisoners drive even more wild cars in a race that features the winner killing off the others.",/review/rw1963286/?ref_=tt_urv

20 August 2008,Nervegas,6," Twisted Metal meets Mad Max
","I was able to attend the advanced screening here in Dallas and must say I enjoyed myself immensely. While anyone going into this film expecting anything more then a thin veil of a plot will be sorely disappointed, it will definitely entertain those who have the right expectations. That said, this is a no holds barred, testosterone fueled thrill ride. Think of the game Twisted Metal, then throw in convicts, a greedy warden looking only at the profit and you have Death Race. While the movie has plenty of explosions, machine guns, armored cars, gore and beautiful females, there was enough humor and sentiment thrown in to make it all seem worthwhile. Definitely an entertaining film, and one that any over-the-top action movie junkie will surely add to their collection.",/review/rw1963286/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2008,the-movie-guy,8," The title ""Death Race"" tells it all
","Synopsis - In 2012, the United States economy collapses and life for everyone is not the same. Once a NASCAR champion, Jensen Ames, (Jason Statham), hits rock bottom and spent several years in prison. His life was improving and changing for the better after meeting and marrying Suzy (Janaya Stephens) and having a baby girl. Then the steel mill closes, and he loses his job. But that was not the worst thing to happen to Jenson that day. Suzy is brutally murdered, and he is framed for her murder. Jenson is sent to Terminal Island, the worst and toughest for-profit prison in the country run by Warden Hennessey (Joan Allen). She has created the country's most popular pay-per-view sport, a kill-or-be-killed car race where the inmates race to win their freedom from prison after 5 wins. Every inmate driver is driving a monster car that they built which is loaded with machine guns, missiles, flamethrowers, napalm, and no rules. Warden Hennessey convinces Jensen to secretly take the place of the late 4-time superstar winner, Frankenstein, and wear his metallic mask in the race. If Jensen wins just one race, he can go home to his baby daughter. To get to the finish line, Jensen must kill his competition before they kill him.",/review/rw1963286/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2008,knapp1991,7," hot women and fast cars, death race is a man's movie
","I just saw this film last night at a premier in Portland Oregon.Im not gonna give away any of the story because there isn't much of one which is fine in this case. Explolsions and murder and hot women plus Jason statham equals good movie. I went into this film expecting it to be disaster,and i say this only because I'm anonymous... it was good. Plenty of wow moments to cringe at and not just me but the whole audience. The driving does get a little repetitive but kudos to the director Paul w.s. Anderson for mixing it up. Plus it is a revenge story which everyone loves. BOTTOM LINE if you want to be entertained and don't mind a some violence see it it is worth the price of admission.",/review/rw1963286/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2008,goalieboy45,9," Great Movie
","I went into Death Race with really no idea what to expect from it. I am a big fan of Jason Statham movies but the concept of this movie hadn't really made me too excited to see it. Nevertheless this is a great movie, the humor is spot on throughout the movie, though this is definitely no comedy. The action is fast paced throughout and they come up with some pretty creative ways for characters to get killed. I found the story to obviously be a bit far fetched with it being people racing in a prison and all but never that didn't ruin the movie at all and I ended up loving the storyline. Overall, the acting was great, and it had great effects and a good storyline. I consider this a must watch for those who love action movies. 9/10",/review/rw1963286/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2008,bob the moo,," A genre film with all the genre weaknesses but is still entertainingly noisy and violent fun for the male target audience
","The country may be in chaos but one time NASCAR champion and recent convict Jensen Ames is trying to get his life together with a wife, child and badly paying job. However when he is framed for the murder of his wife he finds himself back in prison. The prison system has changed from the one we know now though, and televised violent sports with inmates has morphed into Death Race  a deadly cross between NASCAR, a demolition derby and murder, whose leading star is a masked prisoner known as Frankenstein. Unfortunately this star died after the last race giving executive Hennessey a ratings problem. Jensen is offers a simple, no choice opportunity to mask up and race as Frankenstein. Meanwhile, innocent of his crime and wary of the amazing coincidence that his conviction coincides with Death Race's need of a top class driver, Jensen starts to suspect who was really responsible.",/review/rw1963286/?ref_=tt_urv
