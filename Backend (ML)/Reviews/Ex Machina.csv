11 September 2015,Jim-Eadon,9," Intelligent Movie
","This movie is obviously allegorical, a fascinating tale about AI, but it is mainly about manipulation and power. It isn't for those wanting action or spectacular CGI, the movie is aimed at people who like to think, rather than passively wait to be entertained. There are themes here not only about AI, but also about surveillance, with excellent points about how data about us is collected by phone companies, search engine companies, commercial operating systems makers and so on. The plot seems simple but isn't, it's extremely clever, with the protagonist playing games, trying to stay one step ahead of one another. This is a movie with perfectly consistent internal logic that plays out perfectly. Don't go in expecting too much, however, as I can see most people will not be satisfied by this movie, but for me, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly. Therefore I give at least 9/10. And most recent movies have been getting 5/10 from me. This movie succeeds where another recent movie about AI, Transcendence, I think it is called, failed (but it was an interesting failure). A third movie about AI, a Spanish movie called Eva, was also brilliant. Eva was more moving and this movie more philosophical. But both movies were perfect in their different ways. The AI's name in this movie, Ava, seems to be a nod to the title of the Spanish movie. As an aside, it's nice that no ""stars"" appeared in ""Ex Machina"" and ""Eva"", the casting was great. Of course there are several aspects of this movie that are unrealistic and often absurd. But because this is an allegorical movie, these are acceptable, because the movie is making points, rather than striving for realism. It's more of a fairytale than accurate portrayal.",/review/rw3252206/?ref_=tt_urv

",Ex Machina has a simple story dealing with a deeply complex and philosophical topic: namely what makes humans human.,/review/rw3252206/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2015,themissingpatient,9," Paranoid Android
","Ex Machina has a very fitting sense of false intimacy. This is done visually as many of the close-ups are seen through glass. No matter how close we get to the subject on-screen, there always seems to be at least one wall of glass between us and it or them. The film also makes a very distinct contrast between it's interior and exterior shots. Outside of the facility is breathtaking landscapes. It is big, beautiful, refreshing and vibrant. Inside seems like an endless futuristic maze of glass, mirrors, plastic, chrome and dim lights. It is clean, cold and claustrophobic. A perfect setting for the subject that is explored in this tight, tense sci-fi thriller.",/review/rw3252206/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2015,deloudelouvain,8," Robots will take over the world
","This is the kind of movie I really enjoy when I think about science fiction. Movies that make you think if we should continue trying to progress even more. Are we not already smart enough with everything we have? With all our daily gadgets that we can't miss for one second. Do we really need artificial intelligence? Because let's face it, once that will be concrete then we won't do a thing by ourselves anymore. We will send our robots to our job, we will chose and model our life partner like we want them to be. The story of Ex Machina might be futuristic but I certainly can imagine it like that in the future. All actors were good in their respective roles. For a movie that is filmed at the same spot all the time you certainly don't get bored for a second. Nice science fiction like there should be more of them.",/review/rw3252206/?ref_=tt_urv

7 September 2022,SPZMaxinema,8," Not what I expected...
","This is a story that explores a wide range of topics including philosophy, psychology, theories about the future/mankind, and more! The twists/turns in this movie are done really well and the ending defied my expectations. While it was a bit slow a few times, I thought that it was ultimately worth going through. At times it was creepy and makes you feel uncomfortable yet at other times it was beautiful and had impressive acting as well. All 3-4 of the main cast did great!! I loved the music in the more intense scenes as well, and whatever sound effects they used that weren't quite music but worked well subtly enhancing the mood. It was a modern-day Blade Runner!",/review/rw3252206/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2015,MattBirk,9," A Future Sci-Fi Classic
","Ex Machina is easily one of the greatest movies to ever tackle the ideas of artificial intelligence. Everything about the movie is put together in an elegant and intelligent way, the movie tackles the ideas in a mature way. There are no elaborate human vs machine fight scenes or military overlord presence, instead Machina focuses on the ethical questions that come from 'creating life'. And though the premise might sound unoriginal or derivative, it's when they mix in the idea of sexuality that the movie becomes something different.",/review/rw3252206/?ref_=tt_urv

22 July 2022,tindfoting,8," Another strike by Alec Garland
","I have a tiny suspicision Jonathan Nolan saw this before writing Westworld... anyway.... Caleb, a talented coder, wins the Willy Wonka to visit the world richest and most brilliant arsehole. Nathan, a prodigy in AI, who lives like an eremit in the middle of nowhere. Caleb is invited to do a test on Nathan's giant breaktrough; a walking, talking robot, Eve. Trough numerous sessions Caleb will decide if Eve can make decissions on her own, or if it's all part of her programming. Needless to say, things will get very weird, very fast. It soon plays out like a long round of chess between Nathan, acting strange, and Caleb, who finds himself attracted to Eve. It's a brilliant little story, in fact. Both the sessions and the creepy story behind Ethan's breaktrough. And Garland deserves praise for making a small movie look like a million bucks. The ending.... holy crap. Mr. Alfred Hitchcock would be proud. It's so menacing, even though we get a small hint in ONE conversation. I really loved that ending beyond words.",/review/rw3252206/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2015,CharlieGreenCG,10," Highly recommended!
","Having wrote the stories to some of his biggest hits, first-time director, Alex Garland, has spent a lot of time with the masterful Danny Boyle: working on such films as The Beach, 28 Days Later and Sunshine. Now, writing and directing his feature debut, Garland proves that he has been paying attention and taking tips as he tackles a complex sci-fi thriller about artificial intelligence.",/review/rw3252206/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2015,simon-page-1,9," Humans and their opinions
","I don't often feel the need to review films on here, but after I have seen a film I like to see other peoples opinions, as I find it interesting, although very annoying too. It shouldn't annoy me I guess, but when thoughtless, nonsense, throwaway films are given 10 stars, and films that have a lot of thought and effort put into them are picked apart and given low ratings by idiots I get wound up. Anyway, I loved this film. Watched it last night on DVD. It has depth and darkness and leaves you with something, as great writers and directors can only seen to do occasionally. It is very atmospheric, with a great soundtrack, great performances by each actor. If you like action films, why do you go to see this? Reviews are always available online here. It is pretty obvious that this film is meant to be intelligent and thought provoking, rather than all-action Hollywood. If you have a short attention span then you will probably not like this film. Give it a chance and get drawn in... it's great.",/review/rw3252206/?ref_=tt_urv
