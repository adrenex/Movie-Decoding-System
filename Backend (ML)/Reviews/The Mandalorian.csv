","In New York, the process server Joe Tyler (Matthew Perry) is assigned to deliver a divorce paper to Sara Moore (Elizabeth Hurley). Her wealthy Texan husband Gordon Moore (Bruce Campbell) is cheating her and also trying to take all their money for him. Sara offers one million dollars to Joe serving Gordon first, and he travels to Texas with Sara trying to accomplish his task. Meanwhile, the serving company sends Tony (Vincent Patore), the colleague and enemy of Joe, to serve Sara. A dispute begins with the oponents trying to serve the divorce papers first, to get financial advantages in the process.",/review/rw2260425/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't know why everybody is bashing this little movie. Granted, it's not an ""extraordinary film"" nor is it Oscar material, but it does get the job done, and that is to entertain for an hour and a half. Matthew Perry's character is not that far removed from what he does in ""Friends"", so if you like ""Friends"" style of humor, you'll have no problem enjoying ""Serving Sara"". The premise of a guy delivering court notices isn't very attractive, but the movie does a fine job in stretching this premise and making it funny. Liz Hurley looks, as always, hot and Bruce Campbell(EVIL DEAD) is funny as the Texas business Honcho trying to divorce his wife.",/review/rw2260425/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2003,filmfreak-5,," Oh yes...
","I saw this movie, mainly because Matthew Perry was in it, and I love his Chandler Bing character. Now, I first feared ""oh no, this is going to be some romantic mumbo jumbo"", but NO. Ofcourse this film contains romance, but it's ok, cause it's funny as hell. Perry makes several characters in this movie, which are worth it alone. Hilarious and I can definately recommend it, eventhough the plot line is a little weak, but Perry and his co-stars makes totally up for it..",/review/rw2260425/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2007,GOWBTW,8," Funny Movie!
","Matthew Perry and Elizabeth Hurley serve up a very funny, and fine comedy romp in ""Serving Sara"". Perry plays Joe Tyler, a processing server who boss(Cedric The Entertainer) is more conniving than himself. He and his lackey Tony (Vincent Pastore) makes lots of money serving people. Upon making a serve, he meets Sara(Hurley) and gives him a offer he couldn't refuse. After getting his nose busted, the new partnership has begun. I like the part at the airport where Sara's jeans get mangled up at the conveyor belt. Then when they get to a cheap motel, she flashes the night auditor. The recipe of this team-up is revenge on her ex-husband(Bruce Campbell). Tony, Ray Harris' co-worker is more inept than helpful. He gets the paperwork done, but the time zone gives his the disadvantage. Revenge does have its price, but if it's right, it's a payoff. The result, living large and in charge! Great movie, great cast, so-so response from the critics. But I don't care! You got served! 3 out of 5 stars!",/review/rw2260425/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2006,RoodyMan,8," Not Such a Bad Comedy
","Frankly, the amount of stars this movie received on this site is sickening. I honestly found this movie to be an adequately comical film, and can't see how it only received 4.8 out of 10. Now, obviously it wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but I did find myself laughing at it quite frequently. I really can't think of anything major that would yield such a low score. The acting was good, the cast had Mathew Perry, Elizabeth Hurley, Jerry Stiller, Cedric the Entertainer, a cameo from Mike Judge, and someone who I believe deserves to be in many more movies, Bruce Campbell. The story was sufficiently original, and the movie had, a brilliant, yet unforeseen twist towards the end. The only thing I could possibly think of for people giving this movie such a low rating, is that people tend to over-analyze comedies way too much. You can't expect a drama movie to be the same as a comedy, it just doesn't work that way. Personally, I would like to see this movie again, and feel that it deserves a better rating on this site than it obtained.",/review/rw2260425/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2015,anaconda-40658,2," Serving No Good Cause.
","Serving Sara (2002): Dir: Reginald Hudlin / Cast: Matthew Perry, Elizabeth Hurley, Bruce Campbell, Amy Adams, Cedric the Entertainer: Stupid comedy that certainly doesn't serve up decent entertainment. Matthew Perry is controlled by his job and by Elizabeth Hurley. He may be a server but he is still driven by another force. Simple plot has Perry sent to deliver divorce papers to Hurley but her husband is a rich cheating liar so she talks him into serving him divorce papers first so that she may gain half her husband's assets with Perry a promised one million. Thus begins a dreary road trip of useless clich√©s and a complete lack of originality. It is obvious that they will fall in love and nobody cares. Directed by Reginald Hudlin who also made another laugh lacking comedy called The Ladies Man. Perry reciting the loser gets girl role while Hurley is a prop for sex scenes. What is truly depressing is that audiences were more anticipating Bruce Campbell than the star studded leads. Unfortunately, as the husband Campbell is greatly reduced to a standard boring role undeserving of his talent. Strangely enough, Campbell could have sold this film on his own. Amy Adams and Cedric the Entertainer are also featured in this travesty. This film exist merely for its leads whose careers won't benefit from this. Pointless romantic drivel serves these actors with nothing but shame. Score: 2 / 10",/review/rw2260425/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2002,HeavensMee,5," It Could've Been So Much More
","I watched `Serving Sara' on Saturday. I wish I could say it was a very funny film. I wish I could say that Matthew Perry doesn't look unhealthy for most of the movie. I wish I could say that Elizabeth Hurley was a good comedic actress. I can say that it's clear even when she's acting that Ms. Hurley is a very classy lady. She's also obviously comfortable in front of the camera. However, her use of exaggerated hip swaying and mouth expressions isn't effective in carrying the jokes. When I think of popular actresses who are naturally funny, I think of Julia Roberts and Meg Ryan. Both these ladies utilize their eyes and whole faces in delivering their comedic lines. As for the very likeable Matthew, the circles under his eyes and his drawn face made it hard for me to focus on his performance. His delivery was similar to his acting in `Friends', but in `Serving Sara' his appearance throughout the whole movie seemed subdued. Perhaps he lacked gusto due to the health crisis he was battling at the time of filming or maybe he was directed to be less `Chandler', and more streetwise and scrappy. As for the other two main co-stars, Vincent Pastore basically plays his character in `The Sopranos'; I couldn't detect any difference between his movie performance and television persona.  Cedric `The Entertainer' caught my attention with his on-the-verge-of-a-heart-attack performance as the boss with a short temper and high blood pressure.  However, his schtick ran out of steam rather quickly.  I became unimpressed after his second remark about `that bitch' revealed a lack of original dialogue.  Still, if you're a Matthew Perry fan, as I am, the movie isn't an entire waste.  The actor's good nature shines through, even when his role calls for him to be something of a jaded character. I had a few chuckles at some of Matthew's more physical scenes and got to watch him for an hour and a half, so I left the theatre with a smile on my face.",/review/rw2260425/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2002,jotix100,1," Possibly the worst film of 2002!!!!!!
","Matthew Perry should feel lucky he makes millions on his daytime job, ""Friends"". He should forget about feature films in the future. Not only is this the most inane comedy in many years, but it just proves that Mr. Perry is someone made for TV and the masses. An actor, he is not.",/review/rw2260425/?ref_=tt_urv

",After seeing all the promotion Mr Perry has been doing over the last week or so for Serving Sara I started looking forward to this movie more and more. I went in today after reading what some of the reviewers had been saying about the movie and I have to admit I was a little worried I would be disappointed but the reviewers couldn't have been more wrong about this one. Matthew Perry is a fantastic actor and I have to agree with everything Larry King said to Matthew on Thursday 22nd August on his show,/review/rw2260425/?ref_=tt_urv

","Maybe, the best motif to see this comedy is Cedric the Entertainer. because, except him, all is well known. jokesr, tricks, the levels of story, performances and roles who are just sketches remembering the old classic comedies. but, sure, Matthew Perry and Elizabeth Hurley are a nice couple and the holes of story are in decent way covered. and, maybe, that represents the lead motif for not be real critic about the film.",/review/rw2260425/?ref_=tt_urv

","I love Matthew Perry in Friends with Jennifer Aniston and company, and Matthew's genuinely great in The Whole Nine Yards and The Whole Ten Yards too with Bruce and the gang, and Perry's literally perfect in Fools Rush In alongside Salma Hayek, and I never do this, but here is a short list of five male actors named Matthew who'd I rather see in Serving Sara in Matthew Perry's role besides Matthew Perry - actor named Matthew #1 - Matthew McConaughney (but of course, never disappoints) - actor named Matthew #2 - Matthew Broderick (woulda been better in the '80s yet still) - actor named Matthew #3 - Matthew Lawrence (missed opportunity) - actor named Matthew #4 - Matthew Lillard (close call but still) - and the actor named Matthew who I'd rather see in Matthew Perry's part in Serving Sara #5 - Matthew Fox (from Speed Racer & We Are Marshall!).

29 May 2003,herbqedi,1," Worst attempt at a screwball comedy I've ever seen
","Insufferable mess about process server Matthew Perry trying to rescue a trophy wife from a disadvantageous situation.  Actually, I've already made it sound better than it is.  The plot specifics make no sense.  Joe Viterelli is totally wasted as a moronic mafioso. All the characters are over-the-top caricatures. Everybody is both stupid, narcissistic, and cynically motivated.  In short, the writing and direction are impossibly bad, and only Elizbeth Hurley manages to imbue her character with any credibility.  Matthew Perry and his cohorts at the process-serving company are particularly incompetent in their roles.  Perry is all over the map, and clearly had other things (drugs?) on his mind.",/review/rw2260425/?ref_=tt_urv

","First off if you want to see Elizabeth Hurley looking beautiful, and strutting around in a ridiculous but sexy outfit most of the movie, you are in for a treat. If you think this is a comedy, or romance, or even action...You'll be disappointed. I think the plot had potential, but the dialogue is painful to hear, predictable to guess, and make next to zero sense. (I'll give you one example) Matthew Perry's character said he was a lawyer who just couldn't work defending lowlife characters for the money, so he quits to become a court process server... OMG you could go prosecution or another type of attorney (contracts, Constitutional Law, Criminal Law, procedural, evidence, and property.) your character passed the BAR exam! It's non-stop lying with unrealistic scenarios. Also you'll genuinely enjoy the movie better if you'd fast forward every scene that has Vincent Pastore or Cedric the Entertainer in it! These guys are the definition of annoying! I felt zero romance, and frequently felt let down by the back story and dialogue through-out the entire film. I give it a three because Elizabeth looks fantastic, and Matthew's character gets better as the movie goes. All in all let down for me.",/review/rw2260425/?ref_=tt_urv

","Matthew Perry + Elizabeth Hurley + Cedric The Entertainer + Vincent Pastore + Bruce Campbell = this dreck? This is one of the few times that I agree with the critics in that Mr. Perry (who looks like he was having some personal problems at the time of the filming) and Elizabeth Hurley simply do not show enough chemistry to save this sludge. As usual, the cast is game, but the writing and directing is simply not there. So, what gives the movie the 1 star? Hurley's outfits, for sure and Cedric The Entertainer, and the always sublime Bruce Campbell.",/review/rw2260425/?ref_=tt_urv
