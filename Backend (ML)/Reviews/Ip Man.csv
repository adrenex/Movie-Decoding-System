3 July 2022,RHraga,10," Boo HBO on your decision not to renew!
","I just read that HBO has decided not to do a second season and finish the storyline. So once again the powers that be have decided to leave fans with a half finished show. I don't know about the rest of you, but I am tired of the powers that be doing that. This series has a 7.7 here on this platform, which is really a good score, so that leaves me questioning why even make a series you aren't intending to finish. I am not your biggest fan right now HBO...bad decision.",/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2022,darthsteele-39338,10," HBO PLEASE renew for a 2nd Season!
",My favorite show on TV right now! And this is saying a lot because I watch A TON of TV! Syfy time travel romance. It doesn't get any better! Fantastic writing. Fantastic directing. Fantastic acting! Please let there be a season two!,/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2022,Sunsphxsuns,9," Listen Up Ya'll - It's Far Better Than You Are Hearing!
","If history can repeat itself, let it do so here. The original 2003 source novel, ""The Time Travelers Wife,"" by Audrey Niffenegger, was a dazzling and most untraditional novel. Niffenegger told the story of Henry DeTamble, a likable young librarian who, since childhood, involuntarily travels through time at a moments notice. It is also about Clare Abshire, a convivial artist who first meets the time-traveling 28 year old Henry when she is only 7 years old. From there, Henry and Clare's passionate love affair is born where it then endures across an ocean of seemingly endless time. The 2009 film was exceptional. It's a complicated tale to tell, but nevertheless the film was a beautiful expression of Niffenegge's novel.",/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2022,katharath,9," Looking good!!
","I'm a huge fan of the book (but unfortunately not a fan of the movie). This is the show I hoped to see. The chemistry between the two is very good; the casting is solid. There are some changes to the book but they're fine, nothing too major. This story is not going to be for everyone - the same people who found the book to be ""too hard"" or ""too confusing"" to read are likely the same prudes that ""aren't comfortable with the subject matter"" of this version. That said, many fans will love this. This is the adaptation that the book deserved, it is far superior to the insipid movie. I think most true fans will enjoy this very much, I for one can't wait to see more!! Great start, it's a 9/10 for me.",/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2022,UniqueParticle,8," Solid charming premier!
",Despite being scattered this series is so lovely and intriguing. Theo James and Rose Leslie are superb at least a bulk of the time. The above average rating is fair but I've seen lots over the years and this is really good for a romance series! For the ones that might've been put off I'd say definitely give this a chance it's very sweet.,/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2022,surfingnaked1,10," A lot of naked theo
",A lot of naked Theo . Time traveling. Good acting solid script. Typical HBO very good not great. Well worth watching . Better than most of tv.. a sting song I the background is a nice touch.,/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2022,Asper12,10," Surprisingly great!
","I was a bit apprehensive after reading the reviews but was blown away. As a lover of the book, I think it gets the humour and the edginess just right. It shows that the author of the book is involved.",/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2022,AfricanBro,8," The romance side of it
","I'm a sucker for romance and sci-fi and this brings both together so I love it so much. It felt like I was watching a movie and it's only the first episode and I'm so fired up for the next, I just wanna keep watching. I love a hopeless or unrealistic love story that's somehow been made to work. It's so unique, there's so many time travel movies and tv I've seen but those are usually focused more on the sci-fi element or comedy, while this actually feels like a romance. I heard about it a while ago and I didn't have high expectations because I thought it'd be some unimaginative story, imitative of many time-travel movies before it. There's good chemistry between the main characters, Clare seems to be Clare at each age they meet. Sure, I want to find out how about Henry got to have his abilities and all; but right now I'm more invested into looking at his and Clare's love story. I know it was based on a book and there was a movie adaption before that I now want to revisit as well. It's always a little difficult to imagine an enjoyable romance tv series, but this actually carries the charm throughout so I hope it only keeps getting better from here.",/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2022,cgvsluis,9," Four episodes in and I am loving it!
",This series has two things going for it: great source material and Theo James.,/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2022,nhoelbl11,10," Omg, I'm embarrassingly obsessed
","And a bit enamored by Henry and Clare. I've only reached episode four, which is stellar btw, and how can I be in love with and want to take care of these two characters at the same time? Ridiculous. Like I said, obsessed. Watch it.",/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2022,Stoshie,9," Steven Moffat Time Travels Again!
","I'm a tough critic for TV shows, but I am hooked on this series. The writing is what grabs me the most. I don't know how much of it comes directly from the book, but the writing is just so clever I have to laugh at it at times. Not because it is intentionally funny, but because it is so smart and enhances the story lines so well. I record the show on my DVR, and there are times when I replay scenes because the dialog is so good I want to enjoy it again.",/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2022,zingela-43171,10," Thank God for Moffat!!
","This show is just brilliant, and it's because of Steven Moffat. Please do not cancel! Every time we get a great show, this is what happens.",/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2022,hayley96,9," Enchanting and Complicated
","I stumbled on this show. I really like Rose Leslie and I thought I'd take a chance. The show has a great look, the principal actors have chemistry. Fascinating premise. It includes shots from the Fields Museum in Chicago. Great start.",/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2022,luisponz,7," True to its source
","Although a few liberties have been taken - some a tad cheesy, the series remains true to the universe created by Audrey Niffenegger. They have added paradoxes to the time traveling timeline that I'm sure the novel's author must be beating herself for not thinking of those.",/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2022,Waflesflugon,9," Has exceeded all of my expectations!!
","I initially watched the trailer for this show, and as a fan of the book (although it's been years since I read it), I thought to myself, ""this looks mediocre and honestly a bit cheesy..."" Well, I am here to say I've been proven wrong. The first episode was good but the second episode has blown me away. The acting is incredible, the storyline has so much depth to it, and I love the way that they've captured the lives of the main characters. I don't usually find myself interested in shows/movies that are classified as a ""drama"", but I feel that this one is definitely worth giving attention to!",/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2022,sandraknezevic-36268,9," Better than the movie
",This episode showed me it has a lot of potential an I am looking forward to the next one!,/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2022,TheRedSunset,8," Ravenous for the next episodes.
","I never expect a remake to be good and was just watching this to create background noise but the first episode was just so bloody fresh and brilliant. The acting was great, the scenery and cinematography was simple but weirdly delicious and effective, and the dialogue is just plain beautiful. I was immediately immersed into the story and I would say that the characters might be my favorite part of the ensemble if I was a decisive person. I honestly think this might be my favorite of all the adaptations but I realize it's only the first episode and I would not like to make any rash decisions. Still, the whole thing is an understated masterpiece in the way most films/tv shows have ceased to be since about 2013. Safe to say I hope we get about 7 seasons of this and with very long episodes.",/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2022,HorrorFilmHellion,10," After 6 episodes, I struggle to find any real flaws
","Bottom line: They really nailed this, whether you know the source material, or not. It's excellent, engaging, compelling, non-preachy, and technically sound, in every way. This precision display of entertaining craftsmanship was at the top of my priority list for shows to watch until it was done. Everything else took a backseat, which earns this a 10 for me.",/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2022,acampopitt,10," Shockingly Good
","This is an amazingly executed show. I'm quite impressed. When I saw the first episode, my impression was that it was OK, and I had the intention to watch the next episode.",/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,PotatoesAreAwesome,10," Renew this series!!!
","I originally watched this because I heard Theo James was naked in every episode, and he was, which was amazing (especially because there was no female nudity-- and we never get that), but I got so much more than hot female gaze!!! I got a really interesting time travel sci-fi/fantasy adventure romance that always kept me thinking and wondering what was going to happen next. The way time travel is explored here is pretty unique compared to how it shows up in other media. Theo James and Rose Leslie have incredible chemistry in this show, even if I thought some elements of their relationship were a little weird (and the show even jokes about them at times), their chemistry overrides all of that. We also get to see great range from Theo James, playing himself at different ages and interacting with himself. When I finished the show I was so disappointed to learn HBO wasn't going to give it a second season. The story isn't finished, and I still had so many questions about what was going to happen, or if they were going to make any changes to the ending of the book. I hope another streaming service is able to save this great series!!",/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2022,MrsMelling-3551080,10," A fantastic adaptation of the book!
","I've been lucky enough to see all 6 episodes and I can happily tell you that it gets better and better. The chemistry between the two characters throughout the series in my opinion is next to none and it helps that I've always been a fan of Theo James and Rose Leslie. What I love about this adaptation is it sticks closer to the book than the 2009 Film and doesn't really go off kilter. It's a rollercoaster of emotion of highs and lows but I couldn't resist and kept on watching. As an American living in the U. K. I felt they did a great job in convincing me that they were both from the US and the consistency of their performances throughout kept me hooked. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable experience with great writing, production value and brilliant actors. I couldn't recommend it more highly. :)",/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2022,kadiri_alex,10," Astonishing
","I must admit that I find time travel movies a little confusing sometimes but that doesn't make them any less interesting. I've seen the movie for this and it was great. Haven't read the book, although I hear it is very good too. As for this series, there's just one word for it-lovely. I find the leads very interesting to watch. There's wit and chemistry and all the other things that make TV couples exciting to watch. Only seen the two available episodes so far and I especially liked the episode 2 scene where Clare asks Theo's dead mother a question and instantly gets the answer on a tape recorder. Brilliant.",/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2022,kutiehurst,9," Beautiful storyline and great acting!
","As a fan of the book and movie, this show has already exceeded my expectations. I already love this story and its characters and Im so glad it been made into a series! I hope we get a season 2!",/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2022,gigi42758,10," Pick it up!
",We can only hope that another station will make the wise decision to pick this series up! This is so well written and Executed. Not enough shows like this.,/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2022,Tron79,10," Gets me everytime
",This show ranks as my favorite on TV right now. Rose Leslie is a favorite of mine from Game of Thrones. She was excellent in the recent series VIGIL about a murder aboard a nuclear submarine.,/review/rw8235814/?ref_=tt_urv
