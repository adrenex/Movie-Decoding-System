10 October 2022,zardoz-13,8," Real Life Crime Can Be A Hoot
","If you crave true-life crime sagas, ""Gridlocked"" director Alan Ungar's ""Bandit"" should intrigue you. This lightweight but entertaining, action comedy about a lone Canadian bank robber, Gilbert Galvan Jr.,"" better known as ""The Flying Bandit,"" isn't your typical robbery caper. Galvan was more like Willie Sutton than John Dillinger when he pulled his bank jobs. During a five-year period in the late 1980s, Galvan became Canada's most notorious bank robber. Reportedly, from the 59 banks and jewelry stores he held up, he amassed a little over $2.3 million before his luck ended. Never once did he either shoot and/or kill anybody! Indeed, Galvan stuck to a regimen for his robberies. Mind you, 'stage' is a better word. Before he entered a bank, he donned a disguise and shed it later so he could mingle with the other bystanders when the cops arrived. He prospered in his line of larceny because Canadian banks and jewelry stores conducted their business differently from their American counterparts. Clocking in at an ambitious 125 minutes, ""Bandit"" depicts Galvan's criminal and romantic escapades. Basically, this guy lived two lives, and his wife was largely clueless about his criminal deeds. The key to Galvan's success was his affable charm. For example, he asked bank cashiers politely to leave dye packs out of the loot and refrain from tripping the silent alarm. Clearly, Canadians had a different approach to crime. ""Bandit"" qualifies as a new spin on an old subject, and Josh Duhamel musters all of his friendly ""good ole boy"" charisma. Like a three-hour, Martin Scorsese inspired gangland epic, ""Bandit"" allows its hero to break the invisible fourth wall and address the audience for comic effect. Indeed, ""Bandit"" proves the truth is funnier than fiction.",/review/rw8618515/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,ops-52535,8," surprisingly ...
","Well made film about the flying bankrobber of canadian 80's, a ''catch me if you can'' kinda story about a peculiar and ever so impertinent and without any lack of fantasy big time criminal doing banks like it was the local store at the corner, played with bravissimus acts by josh duhamel, supported by elisha cuthbert and mel gibson.",/review/rw8618515/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2022,supermellowcali,7," Well done bank robber movie (not a Mel Gibson film)
","Mel Gibson has a small role (he's great but his recent movies have been really low B-minus) in this 80s bank hiest story starring Josh Duhamel, Elisha Cuthbert, and Nestor Carbonell, all of whom do a great job. The plot is a bit bland and too drawn out, but made more interesting with its great cast, fairly realistic scenes of robberies in pre-internet Canada, and the impression that it's a true story (I don't know if it actually is). If you like bank robber movies, this one is pretty fun and well produced. Not much violence, sex or bad language, so it's a good family movie if you need to be saved from a reality show or (argh) a Hallmark movie.",/review/rw8618515/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," A decent one-time watchable true-crime dramedy.
","It's an interesting story that as a Canadian, I didn't even know about, but even Duhamel's charm wasn't enough to save the disjointed narrative. There are many small issues that failed this film to be great, instead of just good. One of the issues was the long and dragged out 126 min runtime; it had too much frustratingly bland filler and too little engaging substance to hold the viewer's attention. I was getting impatient in many scenes to ""just get on with the story"". I don't mind long running times, especially when time flies in the way the story is laid out and told, but in this case, time dragged on and I kept losing interest in between many scenes. I also felt the film suffered an identity crisis - not sure if it wanted to be taken seriously, or make me laugh along the way. Both happened, but not enough of either to keep me entertained in the 126 mins. The funny parts weren't funny enough, and the suspenseful parts were too far in between. I feel this needed to be cut down to a 90-100 min runtime to be more enjoyable. The middle parts of the film just didn't hold my attention very well. Even the narrating felt half completed and question if it needed more, or none at all to get the story going. It all just felt too bland and pedestrian to keep me entertained throughout. Although performances were decent and convincing especially Gibson and Duhamel, and the cinematography and score on point, this could've easily been more fun and suspenseful in the hands of more seasoned filmmakers.",/review/rw8618515/?ref_=tt_urv

23 October 2022,deloudelouvain,7," Bank robbing looked almost too easy.
","Bandit is based on true events, that's how it starts, and that always makes it more interesting, gives the story a little punch. It's hard to believe though, makes you almost want to rob banks yourself, that's how easy it looked. But that was then, this wouldn't be possible anymore in this time and age. The story is easy to watch, no boring moments, a pinch of humour, and a good cast. Josh Duhamel plays the main character and he made him believable, a charismatic con artist that looks like he could get away with anything. Mel Gibson has a smaller role but for once he wasn't bad, a thing you could not really say for the last past years. If you like the crime genre Bandit is certainly worth a watch.",/review/rw8618515/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2022,aubie84,8," Surprise: Good Actors Make a Great Movie.
","You've got Josh Duhamel who's underrated with wit and humor... then the last Genuine man in Hollywood- Mel Gibson doing his thing... and then to see the Stunner, Elisha Cuthbert -our hypercrush from our recent youth (if you're a middle aged man) of 'The Girl Next Door' as a love interest. That foundation alone gives any movie a 6.8-7.0. Add in a good script with known & unknown twists- and you have a real refreshing movie. I enjoyed the feel and pace along with the throwback 1980's timeline. If you are looking for a good movie that'll put you in the mischief, and make you care what happens, I say this is worthwhile. It has a bit of that ""X"" character that adds to a good film, but when asked- you can't quite put your finger on it. Give it a shot.",/review/rw8618515/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,kassdo,9," Very entertaining film - value for the price
","Came across this ppv film and was very pleased for the fact it told a story without any subliminal wokism. I always question films that claim to be based on a true story. The script and the acting were well done. Mel Gibson is turning into anexecellant character actor in his old age. His Tommy K character was the perfect foil for the Police Detective trying to bring down his criminal empire. I did not know the lead actor but he was great as the Flying Bandit. Taking place in Canada, you grasp instantly how beautiful the country is... I hope it was all filmed there becuase the shots of Ottawa were intresting enough to make me think about touring the Captial City. A couple shots made me think old European cities that sit on the large rivers. Sit back and enjoy the film for what it is.",/review/rw8618515/?ref_=tt_urv

29 September 2022,itakethesquare,8," Wholesome, Mel Gibson does well.
","Josh Duhamel is a diamond in the rough -- I wish he were in more film; he's clever funny with a little bit of edge. This is sort of like Catch Me If You Can with the pleasantness as well as robberies. Mel Gibson once again produces and stars in this and you can tell because he plugs in his beliefs which are against the mainstream and does it in a subtle way that it doesn't hurt anybody unlike the other side does. This is a warm film about a thief who is a master of disguises and doesn't harm anybody during the heist. The police are jealous that he can live in luxury while they have to do actual work. Gibson plays a mobster which is fun to see him play parts that he wouldn't be in real life (Father Stu for instance), and is believable. Elisha Cuthbert is lovable as always and plays a really down-to-earth wife who knows her husband is a bank-robber but knows that the money belongs to a corrupt branch of government that forecloses homes.",/review/rw8618515/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,cosby_don,8," Decent Flick I Just Happened to Come Across
","I just happened to turn on Showtime and saw this movie on. I don't care for Mel Gibson but I was pleasantly surprised by the writing and acting by the lead character. The dialogue was very good and acting good from everyone, actually.",/review/rw8618515/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,DezmoTheMovieMan,7," I found this movie entertaining
","Sometimes all it takes is a good story, then the remaining pieces fall into place. Josh Duhamel did a great job portraying Gilbert and carried a strong presence throughout the movie with the accompanying cast. I've always been a fan of Elisha Cuthbert, and felt adequately sorry for her as her character navigated through a complicated relationship.",/review/rw8618515/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2022,TheRadiobox,7," Steals the time with record personality
","Bandit was directed by Allan Ungar, written by Kraig Wenman who adapts from a novel by Robert Knuckle, and stars Josh Duhamel, Elisha Cuthbert, Nestor Carbonell, Swen Temmel, and Mel Gibson. It's about the true story of the Flying Bandit, who robbed 59 Canadian banks while being hunted by a police task force.",/review/rw8618515/?ref_=tt_urv

27 October 2022,danieljfarthing,8," Slick, bright '80s-based, Canadian true-crime drama that's a must-see for heist-flick fans
","In '80s-based, true-crime drama ""Bandit"" Josh Duhamel (excellent) is a small-time American escaped felon who sets up in Canada where with his attempts to go straight faltering & new serious girlfriend Elisha Cuthbert to support, he becomes an unprecedentedly prolific nationwide bank robber sponsored by organised crime boss Mel Gibson (decent)... but the tenacious po-po (led by Nestor Carbonell (good) & Swen Temmel) are on their trail. Kraig Wenman's screenplay is well paced & engaging (if a tad skewed to laud Gibson's character (probably less likeable in real life))) and director Allan Ungar delivers it in slick, bright style. This is a must see for heist movie fans.",/review/rw8618515/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,chanellejholder,8," I'm emotionally invested!
","The difference between this story and the average heist movie is the raw and vulnerable connection you feel to the characters and their stories. It's not just the excitement of the chase, but it's the why behind the chase and that is so uncommon.",/review/rw8618515/?ref_=tt_urv

","The film opens with a bank robbery in London, Canada 6/12/88. It then flashes back to years earlier as we see Gilbert William Galvan jr. (Josh Duhamel). He does some early asides to the camera as he gets sentenced to a minimum security prison in Michigan. He escapes and ends up in Canada. He discovers how easy it was to rob banks. You go into a bank, politely ask for all the money. Instruct the teller not to trigger the alarm or put dye into the bag. Thank them and leave. While in Canada he hooks up with Andrea (Elisha Cuthbert) who quickly discovers what he does and goes on one job with him. While based on a true story in reality his wife did not find out until he was arrested. Our robber known by an alias Robert Whitman, also had a relationship with Tommy Kay (Mel Gibson) based on real life character Tommy Craig aka ""The Fat Man"" a well known Ottawa fence who headed up the Chrysler gang as they all drove Fifth Avenues. Had the story been fictional he would have given his wife a Teddy Bear loaded with cash and had nothing in his case.",/review/rw8618515/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,lakings97,8," Very entertaining Bandit
","Bandit is a true story about an inmate from Michigan who breaks out of prison and moves to Canada. He changes his identity from Gilbert Galvan Jr to Robert Whiteman. Josh Duhamel takes the lead role with Elisha Cuthbert as his wife. The movie is based on the book The Flying Bandit where he robs 59 banks and jewelry stores in a row making the most amount of robberies in Canada and stealing over $2.3 million. At the end he ends up broke and thrown in jail for 20 years. Mel Gibson played the local strip club owner who help put up the expenses to rob the joints while Nestor Carbonell played the lead detective to capture Robert. Due to Covid, the filming was moved from Canada to Georgia to complete the film. Overall loved the story, great actors and it was very entertaining. I would definitely watch it again.",/review/rw8618515/?ref_=tt_urv
