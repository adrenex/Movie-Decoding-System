14 August 2022,waitingforgodot,9," Beautiful film, painterly
","What a beautiful film! The choice to use non-actors was brilliant, as this film feels entirely real and true. I was absolutely engrossed by this simple story filled with immense complexity, dealing with family politics, gender, the working class, tradition, the encroachment of the new, among many others. Beautifully shot as well, the film had many frames that looked like paintings. Beautiful and quietly devastating, yet hopeful. 9/10.",/review/rw8385482/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film, though a tad overlong, stayed with me for a long time afterwards.and left me feeling very sad.",/review/rw8385482/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2022,JuguAbraham,7," Should have won an acting ensemble award, not the Golden Bear
","The only positives were the amazing performances of children, teenagers, and the very old in the film. It deserved an acting ensemble prize at best. Carla Simon deserves praise for extracting realistic performances. Little else. The script was predictable on change in values that are influenced by pecuniary factors. The crane removing an old car which later removes fruit trees was too contrived for the script. Was it, as the ultimate Golden Bear winner, more deserving than the Grand Prize of the Jury winner, from Korea, Hong Sang Soo's film ""The Novelist's Film""? I don't think so. M. Night Shyamalan and his jury that he headed got it wrong, in my view.",/review/rw8385482/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2022,marcsances,8," Accurate, empathic and bittersweet picture of rural life
","Reallistic depiction of rural life that shows both the heartwarming and the harsh living conditions of farmers. Weren't it actually scripted, it would have totally worked as a documentary piece.",/review/rw8385482/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,FilmFanatic2023,7," Captures the Heartache and Beauty of Family, Community, and Tradition
","""Alcarràs"" is a poignant, slice-of-life drama about a family of peach farmers in a small town facing the challenges of modernity and capitalism. The film's story centers around the patriarch, Quimet, and his elderly father, Rogelio, as they struggle to keep their land and way of life when wealthy landowners threaten to take it away and install solar panels. The film is directed by Carla Simón and features a cast of first-time actors who deliver naturalistic performances. While some sequences in the second half of the film drag, overall ""Alcarràs"" is a heartwarming tale of family, community, and the importance of passing down legacies.",/review/rw8385482/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2022,hexodah,7," Beautiful film
","Yesterday I went to the theater with my girlfriend to watch this film which I didn't know anything about. And from the very beginning I was surprised with the quality of it. Everything was masterfully done. The set, the camera angles, the performances, the characters, the dialogues, the plot... All was highly realistic and beautiful at the same time. 100% recommended.",/review/rw8385482/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,josepaulo-72710,8," ""Solid ground, beloved land."" - sings Iris
",A very personal european family drama that unleashed inside of me an incredibly heart-warming feeling of nostalgia that draw a smile on my face ear to ear for multiple times during the movie.,/review/rw8385482/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2022,GoodGuyVal,9," Gives you something to think about!
","This movie is so much more than just a ""Spanish family drama"". Between somewhere warm, welcoming and cold, harsh and melancholic. The family perfectly portrays the generational changes and different problems through a persons lifetime. Also seemingly stands tall against globalisation and ""greenwashing"". The solar panels in my reading represent the end of the era of human labour, and also points out the flaws of the new green movements.",/review/rw8385482/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2022,Horst_In_Translation,6," Interesting idea and documentary-style execution, but definitely not for everybody
","""Alcarràs"" is a new 2022 movie, a co-production between Italy and Spain, even if story-wise and almost everything else, also the language of course, the focus seems to be entirely on Spain here. This also applies to who made this movie as the woman in charge was Carla Simón, a relatively young filmmaker still as she is easily under 40, but fairly prolific nonetheless in terms of television work, short films and this one here is also not her first theatrical release. Her co-writer was Arnau Vilaró and the two have also worked together in the past already on other projects. This film runs for almost two hours including credits and received a really strong critical reception. Taking that into account, it feels almost a bit surprising that the awards recognition was not too massive. Then again, many filmmakers would kill to win the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival like this one here did, but at this point that is the only win so far and not a lot will follow anymore either I think. Nomination-wise, it is pretty similar. The film scored a nomination in Australia, but it surprises me especially that there is nothing in terms of awards attention in Spain itself for the outcome here. For me personally, it was a bit of a Golden Bear week because I also watched another film that won said trophy, even if that happened many years earlier, but still in the new millennium. I cannot say a lot about the cast, but I think they did okay with what they were given overall. Probably my loss. I watch Spanish films here and there, but their faces did not really feel familiar to me. Now I checked some of the profiles and the background and I know why. The director apparently cast actual farm workers to play the characters here for authenticity reasons. I am not sure this was really necessary, but still makes kinda sense. It is really an ensemble performance and there is no lead in here that is more dominant than the others. The one who comes closest maybe would be Jordi Pujol Dolcet then who plays Quimet, the head of the family. His physical presence was nice. I would not mind seeing him in other films, but who knows how many, if any at all, from the cast members will keep having a career or just go back to farm work afterwards. If so, then it was nonetheless an interesting journey for them I am sure. One they will always remember.",/review/rw8385482/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2022,netsior,3," Realistic, would work better as a documentary
","Very good atmosphere and splendid work of non-professional actors. Realistic, melancholic and sweet at the same time about a current problem of rural life. But the sound is awful, you can't understand what the characters are saying even when you know the language. Better watch it with subtitles.",/review/rw8385482/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2022,camilogilmouzo,3," Boring. Nothing really happens.
","A boring movie in which nothing happens. The way it's made it looks like a home video compilation of a bland family. A day goes by and nothing happens, a normal day, a town festival, well nothing special happens. Nothing relevant happens, nothing interesting... It seems to me that it is the typical movie that some posh people from the city who think they are very ecological and eat organic products feel very cool when they go out and say that it is great when they have been very bored. Catalans from the countryside who see that their rural world is ending must also like it. The rest of us have stolen two hours of our lives, by making us fall for the propaganda that we were going to see a good movie and it is bad. Very bad. The only favorable detail is that although the actors are amateurs, they give very good performances. They are the best of a lousy movie. It doesn't fit in my head why it brought awards and nominations.",/review/rw8385482/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2022,theowest,9," A strong family
","See the emotional perspectives of a family owned apple farm and realize the absolute beauty of mundanity and ordinarity in such lives. The work, play, tradition and love being portrayed is done masterfully through calm and strong integrity. It is not often one stumbles across a film so well-crafted with a clear sense of motivation and devotion. I personally really liked this one.",/review/rw8385482/?ref_=tt_urv
