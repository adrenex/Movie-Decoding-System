14 July 2008,bkoganbing,8," Reese Goes To Hah-Vard
","Legally Blonde finds Reese Witherspoon in one of her breakthrough roles as sorority queen Elle Woods who is dumped by her preppy boyfriend Matthew Davis. He's moving on to Harvard Law School where he will get his law degree, marry a woman of good background in Selma Blair and claim the family legacy of public office. So there's no time for his homecoming queen Reese although I'm sure he'd arrange something on the side later.",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2006,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,7," an adorable movie with a great show from Reese Witherspoon
","My rule when rating movies is to review it all by itself....don't compare it to something else that's completely different from itself. That's the mindset you have to have when watching Legally Blonde, the movie that Reese Witherspoon managed to get a Golden Globe nomination out of. No kidding here. It's really an adorable movie that is appropriate for any age....a very light PG-13.",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2009,planktonrules,7," Not particularly deep or convincing...and that's something I can live with sometimes.
","Elle is the ultimate stereotypical ditsy blonde. She is about to graduate college and has spent the last four years being very happy--and caring less about her future. She's the president of her sorority, homecoming queen and has a great fashion sense. Her plans after graduation are to marry her college sweetheart...period. However, when the boyfriend announces that he's going to Harvard law school and gives her the brushoff, at a spur of the moment she decides she's going to Harvard law as well! While no one would think she had a brain, it turns out Elle is at the top of her class and scores a nearly perfect LSAT--and she, too, is admitted to this prestigious institution. There, however, she's like a fish out of water--and everyone laughs at the audacious and seemingly out to lunch blonde. Will Elle fail or rise to the top? No big surprises here, but it sure is a nice ride.",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv

","I didn't go into ""Legally Blonde"" expecting too much. I rarely go to actual movie theaters to see a film (I usually rent videos/DVDs), but I got an advance on this one, and I was kind of sad it had to be this film I was going to see, but I had been invited along with two other people to see it and I wasn't going to say ""no"" for no reason. So I went.",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2012,zardoz-13,10," Blond Ambitions
","""Legally Blonde"" rates as one of the best 'chick flicks.' This clever,sophisticated, but above all hilarious, fish-out-of-water comedy concerns a shunned sorority doll who refuses to take ""no"" from her boyfriend after he dumps her. Elle (Reese Witherspoon) is the smartest Delta Nu Sorority sister and she decides to follow her ex-boyfriend Warner Huntington,III to Harvard Law School. No sooner has Elle arrived than she is made the butt of jokes. Warner's fiancée Vivian invites Elle to a party and lies that it is a costume party. Appropriately, Elle shows up as a Playboy Bunny and realizes that she has made a complete fool of herself. Eventually, Elle meets to kindred souls, a sympathetic law student Emit (Luke Wilson of ""Home Fries"") and Paulette, a manicurist. A stuffy Harvard professor Callahan (Victor Garber)assigns Elle to be a part of the defense team with Brooke Taylor Windham (Ali Larter of ""Final Destination"") who is charged with killing her wealthy husband Heyworth. Eventually, Callahan makes a pass at Elle and she quits. Brooke fires Callahan and has Elle takes over the case. She uses her knowledge of fashion and hair care to exonerate her client. As it turns out, Heyworth's jealous daughter shot him because she found it disgusting that Brooke was her age. Elle graduates with top honors while Warner gets by without honors. The romance between Paulette and the UPS delivery man is amusing. Reese Witherspoon bares wattage with a winning smile.",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2001,jhclues,9," Reese Witherspoon's Best Performance
","Don't judge a book by it's cover.  An old saying we've all heard so many times it doesn't seem to mean anything anymore.  But it does mean something, and it's important; and, before we proceed, go back and read it again.  In fact, let me help you:  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  There.  Now take a moment to think, really think about it.  And if it still doesn't mean anything, take a couple of hours and check out `Legally Blonde,' a comedy with some real teeth in it, directed by Robert Luketic and starring Reese Witherspoon.  The premise of the story has to do with upscale sorority girl Elle Woods (Witherspoon), who instead of getting the long awaited, much anticipated marriage proposal from her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis), finds herself jilted as he prepares to leave for Harvard Law School.  Elle, it seems, just doesn't fit the oh-so-serious, somber profile that the wife of a future Senator must have.  It's all about image, and Elle's own 4.0 grade average earned in her `frivolous' curriculum apparently doesn't carry any weight.  Being outgoing, positive, beautiful AND intelligent just won't do among the `serious' of the `upper crust' elite.  So, because she looks good and enjoys her life, Elle is given the gate, and she just can't understand why.  She's devastated.  But she's also smart.  Smart enough to pick herself up and make a decision that stands them all on their ears. With the grades and the wherewithal to swing it, she enters Harvard Law herself, initially with the intent of winning back Warner.  But along the way she  learns something important-- about the way things really are, about people and about herself, as well.  And she sets out to prove that if there is any `shallowness' around, it's only in the minds of those who perceive her as something and someone other than what she really is.  And, for the viewer, right out of the gate this is someone you want to see succeed in her quest, because her triumph-- whatever it may be or however it comes out-- is going to be one you share right along with her.",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2006,Cedric_Catsuits,10," Feel-good in pink
","From the opening credits and Hoku's superb 'Perfect Day' (even had me dancing) to the very last shot, this film never disappoints. It may be totally fantastic, slushy nonsense but the 'feel-good' factor is high and once again, Witherspoon gives a flawless performance. As my other reviews will show, I do have a bit of a thing for Ms W. - and Selma Blair - partly because I know any movie with which they're involved will be worthy viewing. They have very different qualities and this is exploited to the full in their on-screen rivalry.",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2012,StevePulaski,8," Carried by a performance, and we're left with a subtle yet favorable impact
","It is very rare that films are carried almost solely by one character's charisma, but Reese Witherspoon throws herself into the role of Elle Woods in Legally Blonde, one of the most genial and unoffensive comedies I've seen in a while. Elle is a goofy, girly woman who enrolls into Harvard Law School after her boyfriend (Matthew Davis) breaks up with her at an attempt to lead a life of utter seriousness. Elle is a shamelessly blonde California girl, used to having others think for her, but she is not witless and without a brain in her head. She just prefers not to work it too hard.",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2001,tomrito,9," Good Movie
","Saying this is a good movie may not sound like much, but after watching all the other summer movies, this is a breath of fresh air. Reese Witherspoon is proving to be one of the best young actors of our time and she makes this movie something fun to see.  Other than ""The Sexy Beast"", this was one movie that was any good so far this summer.",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2012,tim-764-291856,7," Ditzy blonde makes good!
","As a middle-aged bloke, a ditzy, frothy blonde who dresses in designer pink and who has as a pet a Chihuahua, who also dressed in pink would have me running for the hills, screaming and violently pulling out my own fingernails.",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2001,Buddy-51,," Clueless Goes to Harvard
","In `Legally Blonde,'  which could well be re-titled `Clueless Goes to Harvard'  - the delightful Reese Witherspoon stars as a ditzy, fashion-obsessed airhead who winds up (through plot complications too elaborate to go through) taking that Ivy League law school by storm. Needless to say, there is not a single believable moment in the film, but that is generally the case with most fish-out-of-water scenarios anyway. What `Legally Blonde' does have is a warm spirit, a bubbly demeanor and a breezy charm that reflect to a tee the personality of its main character.",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2019,godzigodzigodzi,10," a women empowerment movie without even trying
","This movie was listed as one of the most iconic teenager/chick flick movies, and after watching Mean Girls (which I hated and I didn't understand how this movie became an icon), I didn't expect a lot from Legally Blonde. Probably a movie about some shallow, upper class, white teen girl getting into law school because of ""connections"" and realizing it's actually hard, right?",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2001,=G=,7," An enjoyable girl power flick with a mainstream message.
","""Legally Blonde"" is all about Witherspoon as a totally val blonde from Beverly Hills who goes to Harvard and makes good. Predictable formula fun, ""LB"" gets off to a good start with the freshness of ""Clueless"", pushes its own envelope of believability in the middle, and ends with a major feel good moment. Along the way, this fun family flick makes some good points about life's priorities. Enjoyable stuff for 13 and up.",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2006,Lady_Targaryen,8," Believing In Yourself NEVER Goes Out Of Style!

21 June 2010,TheLittleSongbird,8," Surprising

8 August 2011,donwc1996,," I Love Reese
","How can a man of seventy fall in love with a movie star? Well, I did and it's easy when it's Reese Witherspoon. Legally Blond is not a perfect film - the script has more holes than Swiss cheese and the sub-plot is as old as the hills - but who cares when you are looking at Reese Witherspoon who lights up every scene as though she were Times Square personified! What a doll! Of all the current stars she is the ONLY one who really hearkens back to the Golden Age of Cinema and she especially reminds me of Carole Lombard who was the ultimate funny lady who was a knock-out too! As far as I am concerned, Reese can do no wrong - she obviously has brains besides beauty and the two are a lethal combination.",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2020,davidkennedy-91087,9," Pure Charm
","Who says fun-loving sorority girls aren't just as smart as anyone else? This appears to be the question Legally Blonde is asking its audience and the results are infectiously fun and charming. Reese Witherspoon stars as Elle Woods, a rich and pampered sorority girl whose rich boyfriend dumps her when he decides he's going to Harvard to become a lawyer and doesn't see her as the kind of wife he needs.",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2005,lee_eisenberg,10," Who says that blondes have to be dumb?
","If you've never heard of ""Legally Blonde"" and you only see a few ads for it, you'll probably get the wrong impression. This is not some half-formed, oh-I'm-so-totally-hot story. This is Reese Witherspoon showing that she can be hilarious and biting in the same movie.",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2001,Quinoa1984,7," A pleasant summer comedy
","It would seem strange for me to like a ""pleasant"" summer comedy, but I think this one is actually watchable and even gives laughs sometimes.  It is John Grisham meets um, should I say Clueless?  A ditzey yet very smart college girl gets dumped by her boyfriend, and figures out that if she becomes a law student and perhaps even a laywer, she might win him back (even after she realizes he's engaged).  Clumsy at times and of course cliched (aren't they all nowadays), but also fun in a brainless dead-zone way. B",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2006,ccthemovieman-1,6," Only In Hollywood!
","A bimbo becoming a top lawyer: only in Hollywood!! That's the premise here and a winsome Reese Witherspoon pulls it off in a charming way, which she would have to do to make this ludicrous story watchable. It's a bit on the feminist side with most men pictured as shallow but there are women pictured the same, too. In an era PC baloney, at least this film pokes fun at everyone, not just select groups.",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2007,JamesHitchcock,4," Deep down, it's shallow
","The heroine of this film is Elle Woods, an undergraduate studying fashion design at a Californian university. Elle is rather cruelly dumped by her ruthlessly ambitious upper-class boyfriend, Warner Huntington III, who has just been accepted by Harvard Law School and intends to be a Senator by the time he is 30. Warner considers that Elle is insufficiently serious and intellectual to marry a man like himself; as he puts it ""I need a Jackie, not a Marilyn"". (What Warner fails to consider is that, with Marilyn Monroe as a potential First Lady, JFK might have been elected by a landslide instead of having to rely on highly contentious results in Illinois and Texas to put him in the White House).",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2005,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,10," You go, Reese!
","Wow! The main thing I can say about it is, ""You go, Reese!"" There was only one person that I hated throughout most of the film, and that was Vivian (Selma Blair). The reason I hated her throughout most of the film was because she was really snobby! Even though I had that negative thought about her throughout most of the film, I thought this film was really funny, charming, witty, and sweet. It was especially funny during the trial of Brooke Taylor-Windham (Ali Larter). Also, even though Elle (Reese Witherspoon) acted a little crazy at times, I thought she did, indeed, have a lot more legal savvy than she thought she did. In conclusion, if you're a fan of Reese Witherspoon, I highly recommend LEGALLY BLONDE! You're in for a good time and a lot of laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, and see it today.",/review/rw6290270/?ref_=tt_urv

",Legally Blonde (2001) is a movie I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows a California well to do lady that believes she is about to marry her high school sweet heart. Her sweet heart plans to become a lawyer in hopes of becoming a politician one day and she believes she would be the perfect wife to support his goals and ambitions. He doesn't and breaks up with her because he believes she doesn't take things seriously.
