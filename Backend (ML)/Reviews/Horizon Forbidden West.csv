20 May 2022,darkreignn,6," Simultaneously too much and not enough
","The climax of ""Men"" has a certain sequence that can only be described as grotesque - it was a real labor of love, if you will (read between the lines, my friend). And seeing this specific scene take up the entire width of the silver screen in extreme closeup was not something I particularly expected, or wanted, to see in theatres. However, in a weird way I admired this film for throwing caution to the wind - ""Gosh darn it,"" this movie seems to say, ""You'll watch what I want you to watch, and you'll like it!"" And so I didn't mind the initial sequence, until director Alex Garland portrayed it three more times.",/review/rw8158425/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2022,avenuesf,3," Intriguing film totally ruined by the last half hour

16 June 2022,jtindahouse,8," Brace yourself, this one is off the walls
","I've seen some out there films in my time, believe me. But 'Men' is very close to taking the cake. I actually found myself in a mild sense of shock after the film. An usher asked me how it was and I didn't know what to say. I was genuinely lost for words. This movie is a ride.",/review/rw8158425/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2022,sgriff22555,6," Two things to know before seeing Men (2022)
","1. If you are a fan of Mother! (2017) you might enjoy this film. If you thought Mother! Was outrageous, over the top, and excessively metaphorical I would definitely pass on this one. This film is not like Garland's previous films. For reference when I bought my ticket the theater employee said that they had been told to warn people that this film was over the top making me think many people were walking out asking for refunds.",/review/rw8158425/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,rachaelperson,8," Guess I'm the odd one out
","Maybe it's just me, but I really connected with this one. Don't get me wrong, I can totally see why it's gotten such a mixed reaction: it's definitely not for everyone. But I still think that, even if you end up hating it, you should give this one a shot.",/review/rw8158425/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2022,Xstal,8," Mental Anguish Personified...
","Immerse yourself in a not uncommon story of a woman fighting her demons after aggressive and confrontational encounters from her partner resulting in tragedy and guilt. An outstanding performance from Jessie Buckley through a piece of cinema that leaves you feeling constantly uncomfortable, and under no illusion of how abuse perpetuates through the ages, in many guises, and is ultimately so difficult to contain.",/review/rw8158425/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2022,nicolasroop,4," Could've been great, but is completely incomplete
","First off, let me say, that was the strangest ending to a film I think I have ever seen. How this movie got an R rating is beyond me because it is graphic! Secondly, what the hell did I just watch??? The movie was going so well for the first hour or so, beautiful cinematography, a sweeping sound mix and some very brilliant acting and writing all around. But then things start to get... weird. It completely loses it's footing and the film turns into what I can only describe as the worst allegory for depravity and misogyny I think ever put to film. It just didn't make any sense and the more I think about it, the less sense it makes. There is no outright conclusion, only a bunch of nonsense thrown at you in hopes that you'll think it's cool, but it comes off as pretentious and pandering. I would've loved to know what happened afterwards, but alas the movie is unfinished. If you do go to see this one, be prepared for an ending that will either leave you gagging or wanting. It really leaves nothing to the imagination and everything to your imagination at the same time. I only recommend it for the strong acting and beautiful camera work, but other than that, the film falls flat on it's face in the last half hour. 2.5 birthings out of 5.",/review/rw8158425/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2022,stevelivesey67,5," Arthouse folk horror. If that sentence doesn't turn you on.... avoid!!
","In the same vein as the trippy 'Mother', it has elements of religious symbolism, portrayals of toxic masculinity and themes of nature, rebirth and body horror.",/review/rw8158425/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2022,guskeller,9," Atmospheric, meaningful and emotional
","Men is atmospheric, meaningful and emotional. Its protagonist (Buckley) is processing the trauma of a toxic relationship, yet she's haunted by constant echoes of that toxicity. With every interaction, Buckley is reminded of the enabled dehumanization that surrounds her. Men builds tension and drama naturally. It has capable characters, significant subtext, and consistent payoff. Notably, the final act becomes very symbolic and thematic, which will frustrate some viewers. Still, examining the trained inheritance of misogyny deserves recognition. Plus, the entire cast delivers. Specifically, Buckley ranges across anger, dismay, strength and resignation. Thus, Men is emotionally striking.",/review/rw8158425/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2022,DarkVulcan29,4," Tries to be artsy instead of having a plot

5 September 2022,zkonedog,3," Stretches The Bounds Of Even Symbolism/Metaphor Credulity
","I came to ""Men"" because of my love for previous Alex Garland (director) efforts like Ex Machina & Annihilation. What I found with Men, however, was a largely symbolic and metaphorical film that didn't engage me on either level.",/review/rw8158425/?ref_=tt_urv

20 May 2022,maghesj,7," So here's my theory on the crazy ending and movie in General.
",So here's my theory on the movie. She was trying to go to her own garden of eden to escape her guilt from James' death. And the reason the same guy played all the males in the village was he was taking many different forms. He was basically the serpent. But instead of tempting harper to sin he was getting her to confront and accept her guilt. And it wasn't until he shed all his skins to reveal James that she finally accepted it.,/review/rw8158425/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2022,ferguson-6,7," Alex Garland's latest creepfest
","Greetings again from the darkness. This is only the third feature film directed by Alex Garland, but his creativity and innovative nature in the first two (EX MACHINA, 2014 and ANNIHILATION, 2018) established him as a writer-director to follow. His latest is certainly deserving of those descriptions, yet it's also less assessable while being more open to interpretation and worthy of discussion. Reactions from viewers are sure to be varied.",/review/rw8158425/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2022,schlomo-jones,3," What the @!?$ did I just watch?
","This movie has a very creepy mood and sets a tone for a typical horror movie, with a bit of art-house touch to it. For the majority of the movie it feels like you are watching a creepy horror movie like so many others, but it gets really bizarre in the end, and it just makes no sense. Trying to not spoil it, but the last ten minutes is just some weird Freudian symbolism, and body horror that left me wondering what the point of this whole thing was. I'm guessing there is some message about toxic masculinity or misogyny in there but I really couldn't parse it out of the nonsensical ending. This might be worth watching when it hits streaming, but I wouldn't pay full price for a ticket.",/review/rw8158425/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2022,xiaoli7377,3," What Was This?
","I give props to the cinematography, special effects, and the performances; particularly those of Jessie Buckley and Rory Kinnear. Other than those few positives, this movie is a complete mess. The first half is a complete mind-numbing chore to sit through, nothing really happens. The second half is just very weird with a bunch of metaphoric imagery that I really didn't understand. It also really perpetuates this stereotype of all men being complete creeps.",/review/rw8158425/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,BA_Harrison,3," Remember when horror films were fun?
","When Harper (Jessie Buckley) tells her husband James (Paapa Essiedu) that she is leaving him, he uses emotional blackmail to try and make her stay; when that doesn't work, he resorts to violence. And then he falls to his death (either accidentally or intentionally-it is never made clear).",/review/rw8158425/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2022,jkanecoleman,1," Save yourself. Don't see this movie.
","I'm only writing this to try to convince you to not waste your time on this movie like I did. It's a confusing mess of a film that delivers no answers to it's questions and is only worth watching if you want to see a man thing birth another man thing from his gootch.

1 June 2022,jdesando,," A tour-de-force of allegory and symbolism. And just darn good horror.
","Men is a home horror brew, imperfect for its load of figurative tropes but pleasing to the metaphoric obsessions of an English major who loves allegory.

20 May 2022,PerryAtTheMovies,5," A film that's not theatre worthy....
","I was vastly disappointed with this film. Biggest takeaway. The build-up took too long and the release of that build-up was too smooshed together. While there unsettling moments that took place that were necessary to the build-up. There was a lot of space where, at least for myself, nothing relevant was happening and it caused me to reach moments of pure boredom.",/review/rw8158425/?ref_=tt_urv
