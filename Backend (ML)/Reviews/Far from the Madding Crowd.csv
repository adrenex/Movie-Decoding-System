17 September 2019,continual-one,5," Of course I wanted to love this movie...
","I guess you just can't go back and re-capture that magic and honesty of House of 1,000 Corpses and the superior The Devil's Rejects. I give kudos to Rob for giving it a go but this movie just plain fell flat. All the ingredients were there...Gore, blood, guts, filth, profanity, humor, revenge. I just was not able to get excited scared or involved with the film. It wasn't slow, it was just meh. Granted, I have never been a fan of Sheri Moon and I think she has taken every movie down a notch or two that Rob insists on including her in. Verily, her scenes are like some sort of music video with her prancing around all ""evil"" and cutesy in slow motion. She's clearly the centerpiece here and that's a shame because Bill Moseley is the king of horror and although he does his best with the material at hand, he can't salvage the script and the overall ""story"". New guy, Richard Brake the ""brother in law"" does a decent job filling the gap left by Sid Haig (who does have a brief appearance in the film), but it all feels very forced and lacks overall conviction. It's just ""meh"" and I really wanted it to be Rejects part 2.",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2020,BA_Harrison,3," 3 From Hell -- 3 out of 10.
","I thoroughly enjoyed House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects, Rob Zombie's first two outings for his murderous Firefly clan, but this third chapter is further proof that the rock star turned director has nothing new up his sleeve, and, worse still, seems to have lost all idea of what made his first couple of films so enjoyable in the first place.",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2019,BandSAboutMovies,1," It just gets worse...
","Of all the many movies that Rob Zombie has brought to the screen, his 2003 film House of 1000 Corpses and its 2005 sequel The Devil's Rejects probably have done the best with both audiences and critics. They're wildly disparate movies - the original goes from realism to a phantasmagorical journey below the titular house into the world fo Dr. Satan. And the sequel really works well - it's a grimy, gritty journey through the world of its serial killing protagonists.",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2019,beornmatt,3," Tired rehash of a fantastic movie
","I really enjoyed The Devil's Rejects, but this was just a tired rehash. It follows the obligatory formula: setup that establishes how crazy people are, a group of people taken hostage and murdered, the Firefly family running away and then getting betrayed by someone, then a lot of shooting. There's lots of naked women and the trademark kaleidoscope scene that has unfortunately become Rob Zombie's trademark. Sherri Moon Zombie tries to play crazy but comes of as ridiculously annoying, while the rest of the ensemble is lackluster. The script was atrocious; the lines that were supposed to convey the most gravitas were laughably bad, so much so that the person behind me asked her companion if this was supposed to be horror or a comedy. The sole high point was the soundtrack - it was really, really well-done and complimented the movie perfectly.",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2019,alexaserra,3," Nope
","God this breaks my heart. What an awful movie and such a sad way of killing some of my favorite characters of the horror genre. This sequel says absolutely nothing. It is as unnecessary as it is stupid. Well, movies like Halloween, Child's Play and Friday the 13th have numerous unnecessary sequels so what's the difference? The firefly family are humans. Humans die. Specially after being shot 20 times. It was a fine ending to Devil's Rejects and should've been left alone. Well, for some unexplained reason they're back to do absolutely nothing. Zombie has no idea what to do with the characters or the story. He undid everything he accomplished in Devil's by stripping these amazing characters of their purpose and turning them into pointless, unimportant killing machines. I felt such a connection to them on Devil's and this time around I couldn't care less what happened to them, I just wanted this whole thing to be over.
I'm glad Captain Spaulding wasn't on this film or else his essence would've been butchered as well. Oh, and Sheri Moon Zombie keeps getting worse. The woman can't act to save her life.",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2019,Neptune165,1," Baby's over the top acting ruined this movie for me
","This sequel was the worst of the bunch. Danny Trejo was misused and the way they broke Baby out of jail was a joke. And the addition of Otis' brother was just too coincidental, & when they burned that man at the end is beyond ugly. They made Danny Trejos character go out so fast. Well this was underwhelming what do you expect by trying to recharge a finished story. I was super disappointed by the amount of cg blood and gunshots. It looked awful. Truly horrible acting, Sheri Zombie should get the award for the worst acting ever, it's beyond laughable. idk if rob zombie just doesn't want his wife to be killed in this franchise or what. it's just eye rolling every time they pass obstacles unscathed. a bunch of guys with military grade rifles vs. 3 people with hillbilly weapons and somehow they won without a scratch? But these are characters who were locked up in prison for years and for some reason they are better killers? This movie was cheesy and awkward from the acting. I got all the references though but it just didn't flow, it wasn't natural like how Baby just appeared and it was ""10 years later"" uhh ok? and the acting was horrendous.",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2019,scofield7,1," 100% Garbage
",Rob Zombie took a classic ending of The Devil's Rejects and ruined it into this pure crap of a film for the sake to highlight his wife .,/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2020,kosmasp,7," Give them a Brake
","A Richard Brake to be exact! While I understand that some might be missing Sid Haid in this one (fully understand that sentiment and he will not be forgotten, a great human being and actor), adding a new character into the mix, stirs things up the right way. The movie gets down (literally and no pun intended) and takes us on a road trip.",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2019,ramo701,5," Zombie really needs to start directing other people's scripts
","Zombie is a very talented person and I'm a extremely big horror buff but I can't say many good things about this movie.
Let's start with the good.
Theres a lot of Blood and profanity BUT no matter how much of that you toss into a movie it doesn't make it any better.
This is by far one of his worst movies ( and that's coming from someone who found enjoyment in 31 and lords of Salem )
Here's the bad. The plot has little to no meat on it, the zoomed in angles makes it hard to enjoy the violence cause all you see at times is a cheekbone, then blood, palm, then blood and so on. The characters you want to see more of have little to no screen time, and everything is so exaggerated that you really have to suspend ALL DISBELIEF while watching.",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2019,justino1996,5," Something was off from the start
","I attended the 3rd and final night of the film's theatrical presentation. The 3rd night happened to be a double feature featuring The Devil's Rejects leading right into it's sequel. I think this was unfortunately a fatal decision since it truly shows how inferior of a film this is to its predecessor. From incredible first act problems to 75% of plot points being rehashed from the previous film, 3 From Hell falls flat. Imagine a car continuously stalling, it gets so close to taking off, but perpetually stalls. This film lacked that dirty, nasty, gross taste we expect with a Rob Zombie film and instead replaces it with silly silly humor and Hollywood production. The film gradually feels more Hollywood and standard as we approach the third act which presents itself like one big reshot 3rd act almost completely separate from themes and character arcs presented in the first half of the film. While it was a joy to see the Firefly family once again, I feel this film ultimately tarnishes the image of the first two thirds of this trilogy. Predictable and tame; two words I'd never expect to describe a sequel to The Devil's Rejects.",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2019,amandagellar-31077,5," They Should Have Left Well Enough Alone
","I was lukewarm on House of 1,000 Corpses, but The Devil's Rejects remains one of the most interesting horror films of the past 15/20 years, so I was eagerly awaiting to see what Rob Zombie would do to bring his Firefly clan back. Pretty soon into the film, I realized that, sometimes, it's better to end on a high note than to drag things out past their expiration dates.",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2019,UniqueParticle,10," Beyond satisfied!
","Exactly what I was hoping for and more! Very gruesome, profanity filled, gritty, gratuitous, comedic, excellent soundtrack and has great dialogue like the other films. Bill Mosley, Richard Brake, and Sheri Moon Zombie are delightfully entertaining along with the rest of the cast. I'm sure this will get mixed opinions and I will be on the side that absolutely loved 3 From Hell!!",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2019,zach-davis-zd,4," This movie could have been great, but....
","If you are like me, you probably thought that the ending to The Devils Rejects was incredible, almost majestic. TDR was one of the best horror movies at the time and was a great equal. With that said, 3 From Hell was not. If you are someone that just watched House of 1000 Corpses and The Devils Rejects for the first time recently, you might enjoy 3 From Hell. If you have been waiting the 14 years for this movie, it will be a let down. Zombie ended TDR on an incredible note, so having those 14 years to plan out another return of the Firefly family, you would think it would be something unique and unexpected. It wasn't. Your explanation to it was 'odds of their survival are 1,000,000 to 1. They survived'. That's it. I'll put that aside for now. The movie also felt like it was missing a solid plot, but maybe that is what Zombie was going for. The last thing that kind of annoyed me about this movie was 2 scenes. I won't spoil them, but it has almost exactly the same feel as the Hotel scene and the strip club scene in TDR. Overall, it had so much potential and could have been a great movie, but it just failed to hit that level. Worth the 2 hours and $15, but The Devils Rejects will still be Zombies best work in my opinion.",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2019,thenodradioshow,1," 9's and 10's?? Really???
","Ill keep this short. A 9 or 10 rate of this movie and I have to question a persons knowledge of horror/grindhouse movies. This wasnt even so bad it was good. This was simply a quick grab for cash from heavy metal rob and im going to puke if i have to hear his wife aka baby's stupid fake laugh ever again! If you thought 31 or Lords of Salem was bad, you aint seen nothing yet!",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2019,vegeta-07512,3," Worst of the trilogy
","It's just plain terrible, avoid as it will leave you thinking the other 2 films probably weren't that great.",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2019,Gresh854,2," Keeping Up with the Fireflies
","I like House of 1000 Corpses and Devil's Rejects, but this legit was one of the most unnecessary, tedious sequels of all-time. 'Tis a shame. ;(",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2019,peterrifkin,1," He´s done it again
","Mr. Zombie has really done it again. Made a film casting his very mediocre actor wife in the lead. This woman is as bad actor as she is annoying and over-acting.
Its really irritating that he does this time and time over again. The stories are actually good, or okay, but casting his wife like they have some kinda marriage-deal that she has to play in every movie of his. And this reflexes his ability to direct. And ill give him that. Composision and directing action and stuff like that he knows well.
BUT he should take som kinda acting class to learn how to direct actors, are at least know what a good actor is. And a good actor is not just screaming and cussing in every sentence. And its NOT cool or funny. Well, maybe funny for all the wrong reasons. Almost pathetic and childish.
And people can say what they want that ""Baby"" is supposed to be like a child sometimes, but overacting is not the solution.
They only time she does a hale-oaky job is in ""Halloween"", when she is very down in her part. NOT over-acting the place up/stinking it up!",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2019,blazeimpala,3," The Devils Rejects Should Have Been Then Ending.
","Even before the film begins, you are immediately told by the director himself Rob Zombie that there was no intention to create a third film in the series. His masterpiece had come and gone 15 years ago and yet the too often need to relish in past greatness came back to haunt him. The film is nothing like its predecessor's. Its pacing is slow and even annoying at times. Worse the film becomes derivative as it goes on taking useless over amassed tropes to new heights. He could have done so much better and I know that in my heart. But two hours later, like me you'll know why this was only a ""3 Day Event"".",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2019,nogodnomasters,8," This is my death factory
","This is the third in a trilogy using the same characters. Even though everyone had 20 bullets in them from the end of the last feature, they all survived. Sid Haig bowed out of this one as Captian Spaulding dies by lethal injection. The other twosome escape (eventually) and team up with their half brother Winslow (Richard Brake) and continue in the same violent antics as before. Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie) is a bit crazier and hasn't lost her swagger as we go From ""Brick House"" to ""In-a- Gadda-da -Vita.""",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2019,Kolobos51,8," Zombie bounces back after a series of fan alienating films.
","Rob Zombie is possibly the most controversial, off beat, and, in my opinion, interesting filmmaker working today. But after the trippy Halloween 2, the downright surreal Lords of Salem, and the haphazard 31, he is on shaky ground with his own fanbase. And I openly admit I enjoy all of his crazy, wild, over the top movies to varying degrees. But I get why people didn't love his last three movies. So maybe it was logical he would go back to the well and bring back his most iconic characters for a direct follow up to his undisputed masterpiece, The Devil's Rejects.",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2019,misterowl70,6," 3 year wait for this? Wasn't worth it
","Had high hopes like every one with this flick. When Rob revealed that Sid/Captain Spaulding was only utilized for one day of the shoot and not part of the ""3"", my hopes fell significantly. His only scene (yes, scene) lasted 5 minutes, and like the wind is gone forever. Danny Trejo, same fate of a five minute scene. The plot is predictable (this is the Firefly family after all) and strains credulity at points. Definitely a disappointment for me, perhaps as a stand alone movie this would have worked but as a sequel to DR it fails miserably IMO",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2021,Fernando-Rodrigues,7," The Three Hellish
","Rob should've shelved this one. The Devil's Rejects didn't need a sequel, yet, without Sid Haig. We can't forget the weak CGI FX. This movie's script is dull: how could the 3 hellish survive that shooting? why the cops are SO dumb here?",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2019,seasonkay,1," Ugh. Lame.

5 October 2019,Tweetienator,4," Weakest Trip
","I got House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects in my not too small horror collection but Three from Hell won't make it there - not even just for the purpose to complete my collection. While House of 1000 Corpses looked like a fine tribute to the genre, Three from Hell looks and tastes stale: not a total fail but an unnecessary addition to the journey of the Fireflys.",/review/rw5162476/?ref_=tt_urv
