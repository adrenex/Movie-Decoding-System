16 March 2017,bkrauser-81-311064,8," Charming to a Fault
","I've been reviewing films off and on for about five years. And if there is one thing I've learned about criticism is that the vast, unchallenged mean between absolutely great movies and downright terrible ones hides a lot of non-committal fence sitting. I'm guilty of it myself; in today's age of instant self-gratification, it's easy to cobble together a knee-jerk opinion based on someone else's ideas. Problem is those ideas, whether valid or not, sometimes creates a subterfuge of undeserved hype or undeserved vitriol depending on the circumstance. They feed a cycle of wafer-thin subjectivity masquerading as authoritative proof of something's worth. This is why, for example a movie like Equilibrium (2002) can be seen as something more than a splashy Matrix (1999) rip-off while movies like Mystery Team (2009) are swept under the rug.",/review/rw4225167/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2017,evrivali,8," Surprised (in a good way)
","At first I wasn't looking forward to watch Table 19.I assume that you already know the plot if you are reading user's reviews but you are not sure if you should watch the movie or not so , I am just going to tell you not be afraid of the poor rating and just watch the movie.Full of funny and dramatic moments and unexpected twists that reveal slowly the character's background I believe that Table 19 is a great movie for both drama and comedy lovers. All the actors give excellent performances and make you feel closer and more attached to the characters. It was just a great film and I really hope that it gets the reputation that it deserves.",/review/rw4225167/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2017,SnoopyStyle,7," I want the bad table
","It's Francie Millner's wedding. Her oldest friend Eloise McGarry (Anna Kendrick) reluctantly accepts the invitation and is relegated to sit with the unwanted randoms at Table 19. Her ex Teddy is Francie's brother and the best man. She is joined by diner owning couple Bina Kepp (Lisa Kudrow) and Jerry Kepp (Craig Robinson). There are also the released prisoner Walter Thimble (Stephen Merchant), awkward mama's boy Renzo Eckberg, and long ago nanny Jo Flanagan (June Squibb).",/review/rw4225167/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2017,CineMuseFilms,6," An unexpectedly entertaining wedding sit-com.
","Trailers are notorious in over-promising for movies that under-deliver. But every now and then, one pops up that does the opposite. The trailer for Table 19 (2017) gives the impression of a lightweight romantic comedy with a touch of slapstick, all framed around a wedding. Despite being critically panned by many, there is more to this unexpectedly entertaining low-profile film than meets the eye.",/review/rw4225167/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2017,bigkingtut2000,7," I really enjoyed this movie!
","Sure the plot and script might have been a tad predictable, but, it was an unexpected charmer. A wonderful cast and fun script with many chuckles. It is NOT Separate Tables but it certainly was worthwhile viewing a nice little light comedy that is perfect on a summers night. Table 19 contained the misfits of a wedding but eventually had the most fun and impact on their wedding they were the last to be invited at.",/review/rw4225167/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2017,promasallc,7," Brilliant, intelligent comedy. Does not disappoint
","So I loved this movie! It's a brilliant single setting-ish script about various ""reject"" guests at a wedding table with Anna Kendrick in the lead. It's like ""The Breakfast Club"" of wedding movies.",/review/rw4225167/?ref_=tt_urv

20 May 2017,crimewriter34,7," perfectly serviceable
","and somewhat intelligent romcon. I don't know why it didn't get any love from critics, especially with the young and veteran talents of Anna Kendrick and Lisa Kudrow . Solid seven. . . .For peeps who want a dramedy as opposed to a laugh riot. ""Wedding Crashers,"" it ain't.",/review/rw4225167/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2017,paul-allaer,4," huge disappointment from the Duplass brothers--and it's not funny
","""Table 19"" brings the (mis)adventures of Eloise. As the movie opens, Eloise is hesitating whether to ""accept with pleasure"" or to ""decline with regret"" a wedding invitation she just received. In the end she decides to go. She hesitated because she was just dumped, via text no less we later learn, by her boyfriend Teddy, whose sister is getting hitched. Along the way, Eloise is also relegated from sitting at Table 1 (with the bride and groom) to Table 19, a table in the back corner. At Table 19, there are 5 other people, including the bride's nanny, a bickering wedded couple, and a guy who is in a halfway house for stealing. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw4225167/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2017,ferguson-6,6," Team Rejects
","Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/director Jeffrey Blitz (Spellbound) takes the approach that many wedding guests would prefer â€“ he skips the wedding and heads straight to the reception. Another wise move by the filmmaker is assembling a very talented ensemble of funny folks. This cast proves they can wring a laugh from dialogue and moments that would probably otherwise not elicit much of an audience reaction. Instead, the full house on this evening had quite boisterous responses on numerous occasions.",/review/rw4225167/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2017,tsimshotsui,," could have been fun
","the film with that cast - Anna Kendrick, Lisa Kudrow, Craig Robinson, Toni Revolori being some of my favorites - could really have been fun and truly enjoyable. But a good cast doesn't make a good script. I wonder how tailored each role is for the cast, I'm guessing apart from Anna's role not so much? Not sold on the bulk of the film / the main pairing much so that was particularly not enjoyable for me. However, June Squibb was lovely and Stephen Merchant was a welcome oddball (though the humor overall of the film doesn't really land). Conclusions for other story lines were not really satisfying and there was cheesiness all through out.",/review/rw4225167/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2017,dishlady69,8," An Unexpectedly ""Ridiculous"" Success
","So I'm not an Anna Kendrick fan, but this film was well done. Her brand of placid acting is finally well placed in this film. The plot twists are much more interesting than I would have expected. ",/review/rw4225167/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2018,jtindahouse,6," Never quite gets into its groove
","A romantic-comedy simply called 'Table 19'. How did I find myself watching this film you may ask? Well I was at the airport waiting for my flight, reading through Anna Kendrick's hilarious Twitter page. I then got on board, checked the movies available to watch and one of the first ones I saw was an Anna Kendrick movie. I thought if that isn't a sign of the first movie I should watch I don't know what is. Little did I know it would also have two of my favourite comedic actors in it, June Squibb and Stephen Merchant. Not to mention the rest of the cast was pretty good as well. So was the sign from above telling me I would love this film a correct one? Not quite.",/review/rw4225167/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2017,khace,7," Surprisingly Satisfying
","I decided to watch 'Table 19' because I had already seen all of the major blockbuster movies and it looked like a harmless, little piece of fluff. Once the movie started and the guests were seated, the movie really felt like a wedding reception and it became more interesting. The story seemed like it was going to use the same old wedding-story plot, but they threw in quite a few unexpected twists. I really enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would. It was a nice little surprise.",/review/rw4225167/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2018,joel-glassman,7," A Funny Movie For All Misfits
","This is a pleasant, enjoyable movie that will appeal to everyone- especially those who are on the outskirts of life and do not quite fit in.
Anna Kendrick is one of six characters who have been invited to a wedding. Each of the characters does not quite fit the mold of someone you would really enjoy hanging out with so they are seated at a table far away from the bride and groom. Kendrick is the ex-girlfriend of the bride's brother and she still pines for him. The others are a group of quirky characters. 
Those at Table 19 slowly begin to learn about each other and work together to help Kendrick and each other through a series of mishaps. This leads to a number of scenes that will have you chuckling throughout the movie.",/review/rw4225167/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2018,angelapenticuff,8," Intelligent and unexpected
","I loved this movie. I loved the pacing, the predictable moments and the ones that made me look over at my husband with huge eyes and ""no way"" face. I loved the sensitivity that each actor gave to their complex characters. I loved the physical comedy as well as the subtle, well written one-liners. It makes me sad that people didn't like it mostly because it was a lovingly observed film from the back corner of a social occasion.",/review/rw4225167/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2017,Gordon-11,," A sweet film
","This film tells the story of a woman who is invited to her best friend's wedding. The problem is that she just broke up with the best friend's brother after two years of dating. Things get awkward in the wedding ceremony, especially because she is allocated to a table of random strangers.",/review/rw4225167/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2017,inkblot11,5," Wonderful cast tries hard to elevate the mediocre script/story
","Eloise (Anna Kendrick) has been jilted by her boyfriend, Teddy (Wyatt Russell). Unfortunately, Ted's sister is getting married soon and the bride is Eloise's good friend.. So, although it hurts like Hades, El decides to attend the event solo. When the reception begins, Eloise finds she has been stuck at Table 19, the one farthest away from the married couple, filled with misfits. There's the Kepps (Lisa Kudrow and Craig Robinson), who run a diner and don't really know why they were invited. Also, there's Renzo (Tony Revolori) who, as an almost-an-adult teen has hormones raging and aspires to meet a girl with the same. The rest of the table is a tall, tall cousin (Stephen Merchant) and the former nanny of the bride. As can be expected, Teddy is upset that Eloise is there and says so. But, wait, a handsome man seems to appear out of nowhere, and asks Eloise to dance. Also, the rest of Table 19 start to bond over their ""reject"" status. Will Eloise find a new love interest or is she still hung up on Teddy? The very mediocre film has a great cast. Kendrick, Kudrow, Robinson, Merchant, Russell, Revolori and all the others try as hard as they can to bring the story to life. Ultimately, the result is one flat movie with occasional laughs. The setting on an island in the Northwest is nice and costumes are fine but the direction is very tepid. Also, while Russell is a cutie, his scruffy appearance is a turn off to some admirers. My only reason for buying a ticket is that, as a romcom fan, I AM STARVED FOR SOMETHING NEW FROM Hollywood. So, if that's you as well, you might want to give it a whirl. Otherwise, book a showing of some far better film from your own television table.",/review/rw4225167/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2018,tiffanie2300,8," Pleasantly Surprised
","I appreciated that it was unpredictable and how it emphasized the way our perceptions can really have an effect on our overall outlook on people and life, in general. I think that we all need to shift our perspectives on a regular basis and this movie really spoke to that. A+++ job and good acting overall as well.",/review/rw4225167/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2018,alekbod,8," Cute and light
","It is not a masterpiece, but a sweet one. I would watch it as a sitcom too, it has a good potential to it. Especially for those who do not expect a movie to save their lives, reveal the meaning of life or thrill them. I liked the more realistic turn it took and the reminder to never trust your judgements completely. Table 19 turned to be to worse or better than any other tables in the room.",/review/rw4225167/?ref_=tt_urv
