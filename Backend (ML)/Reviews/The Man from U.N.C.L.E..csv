13 July 2002,jhclues,8," Great Cast, Strong Performances Bring It To Life
","A terrific ensemble cast brings this film to life, which focuses on the difficulties some face in making that final, `mental' leap from adolescence to adulthood, and spend way too many years trying to sort it all out.  As one of the characters so tellingly puts it at one point, `I'm not anywhere close to being the man I thought I'd be--' and the denial, that failure to accept the fact that time stands still for no man, and the inability to choose which path to take when you hit that inevitable fork in the road, forms the basis for director Ted Demme's examination of how human nature affects the process of maturating, in `Beautiful Girls,' a drama featuring Timothy Hutton, Matt Dillon and a young Natalie Portman.",/review/rw5571053/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2004,joits,10," Beautiful Girls... beautiful movie...
","Easily one of the most overlooked movies considering how good it is. There are several ensemble movies out there, but this movie is definitely one of the best ones. ",/review/rw5571053/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2004,sponge3,10," Thoroughly Enjoyable (revised review 7/1/2011)
",Update 7/1/11 I still love this movie!! I have to watch it at least once a year and I can't say that about too many movies (I've now seen this more than Star Wars IV). Please allow yourself time to kick back and enjoy a very believable story of Anywhere USA Americana. Below is my original review from many years ago. Thanks,/review/rw5571053/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2000,GilraenEstel,7," A Little Gem
","Having gone to my local video shop, wanting to rent either Gladiator or a big-budget blockbuster type film for my 'Girls Night In', I came across this in the Bargain Bin for only Â£2.99(about $5).  I figured either the tape was run down (with it being ex-rental) or the film was crap and nobody ever rented it.  However, the prospect of Matt Dillion and Timothy Hutton in the same film made me buy it (although my girlfriends were discouraged!)",/review/rw5571053/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2001,keirs-2,10," Captures the imagination and heart
","It is very rare to encounter a film so devoted to character and this is the greatest strength of Beautiful Girls. Each character has their own personal turmoil and lightness which shines through in a film which from start to finish very little movement of plot is actually achieved, but then again it doesn't need to.",/review/rw5571053/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2002,TxMike,," A very entertaining comedy that has a couple of good messages.
","I enjoyed this 1996 film more than most of the current ""blockbusters."" At first glance it would seem that the title of the film comes from the three beautiful girls, plus Rosie O'Donnell, shown on the cover of the DVD box. However, it isn't -- several of the male characters in this small town worship beautiful girls, models, movie stars, and because of that can't look at their own girlfriends realistically, thus the title. In a truly great monologue in the grocery store, with three of the men following her, Rosie explains how those people don't really exist, and if they did, after the sex is no longer a novelty, there has to be more there to hold your interest. In this film, and ""League of Their Own"", Rosie proves she is a much better actress than she is a talk show host. ",/review/rw5571053/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2002,greatdonno,," Stay Cool Forever
","The emphasis of this movie can be placed in Kev's last words to Willy in the film, 'Stay Cool Man, Stay Cool Forever.' All of the male characters in this film with the possible exception of Moe, are trying to stay cool by refusing to grow up. Willy is wrestling with the idea of becoming a salesman and giving up on his lifelong passion of music. Only if he sticks with his music will he stay cool and according to Tracy stay sexy. He is also trying to avoid growing up by not getting too commited to Tracy. In the film he is willing to stray not once but twice. Moe tells him his infectuation with the 13 year old Marty is purely his way of refusing to grow up (not grow old and here Moe makes the definition between the two) but there is a definite chemistry between the two. Meanwhile his grown-up infactuation with the sublimely sexy Endera is his last attempt at a fling before he grows up and decides he wants to spend the rest of his life with Tracey. Endera talks him out of it and tells him how lucky he is to have Tracy in the same way Endera's boyfriend is lucky to have her.",/review/rw5571053/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2004,mjz_70,," 2004 and it's still there
","My friends accuse me (rather accurately) for being a sap - for liking this 90's chic flick. But they are wrong about this movie. This movie is entertaining and sometimes fluffy, but more importantly it is real and timely. Amongst all the hype of the X-Gen, this movie boiled down our mood (all us kids who are still growing up) in a small town setting where the people were real (except for Rosie, she should have ended up on the editing room floor). The slight plot is less important than the setting and the circumstances. Winter in small town Massachusetts, on the frozen lakes, and the plowed roads and small taverns - on the edge of early mid-life adulthood for yet another lost generation...the movie leaves you with a cold warm snow feeling of hope and sorrow for people in transition, that usually only a classic novel (like those by F. Scott or Hemingway)can give you.",/review/rw5571053/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2004,eludeu,10," Truly a classic
","This movie, made up of a dozen or so rising young stars (at the time anyway) is truly a classic. Lots of witty comedy, little bit of love, some twisted moments, everything you'd want out of a movie. It's neither a guy or a chick flick...kind of a mixture of both. Timothy Hutton was absolutely brilliant. Rosie O'Donell, though I despise her at times, has a brilliant feminist scene in which she puts Hutton and Dillon in their place. Uma Thurman, though a fairly limited role in the movie, is a stunning character, and her role ties the movie completely together, bridging the gap between the feminists and the vulgar men in the movie. A young Natalie Portman gets her career off to a great start as a very cute, very sophisticated 13 year old, who's witty charm is the icing on the cake. This movie is clearly in my top 10 all time...and is a must see!",/review/rw5571053/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2004,heysheckie,9," Beautiful Find
","Channel surfing on a snowy day last winter, stumbled on this movie with an intriguing name: 'Beautiful Girls.' Found a terrific movie I had somehow missed when it came out. An incredible cast, great characters, sweet, funny, engaging, and good music to boot. I recently saved it on Tivo, and one of its many charms is that like a book you love, you can pick it up at any spot in the story and be engaged for 5-10-30 minutes or an hour, put it down, and pick it up again.

","Unsuccessful New York pianist Timothy Hutton (as Willie Conway) returns to small town Knight's Ridge, Massachusetts. There, Mr. Hutton will attend his high school reunion, and consider both a career change and marriage, to his lawyer girlfriend (Annabeth Gish). Hutton reconnects with childhood buds Matt Dillon (as Tommy ""Birdman"" Rowland), Michael Rapaport (as Paul Kirkwood), Noah Emmerich (as Michael ""Mo"" Morris), and Max Perlich (as Kev).

13 July 2006,jackreich,9," Beautifully crafted coming-of-age, slice-of-life drama
","I found this one of those films that just has you saying, ""yes! yes! yes!"" throughout. All the requisite elements work together so well here, it views almost as a documentary. Art direction, costuming, sets, photography, direction, script, acting, editing - everyone deserved an award. It's as nearly flawless a film as i've seen. Young adults will resonate deeply to its themes, but all adults will find much to savor.",/review/rw5571053/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2006,Bob-45,8," Beautiful Movie
","""Beautiful Girls"" is a terrific little ""slice of life"" movie, largely due to the remarkable performances of two actresses, Natalie Portman and Uma Thurman. What a cast! In addition to the aforementioned Academy Award winners/nominees, the cast includes Academy Award winner Timothy Hutton, Academy Award nominee Matt Dillon, Academy Award winner Mira Sorvino and Emmy Award winners/nominees Annabeth Gish, Rosie O'Donnell and Martha Plimpton.",/review/rw5571053/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 1999,Tito-8,10," Thoroughly enjoyable
","I was surprised by how much I ended up liking this movie, but considering the outstanding cast, I probably should have known better.  O'Donnell and Rapaport stand out for their wonderful comedic performances, and Dillon and Thurman are terrific as usual.  But this movie is definitely best when Hutton and Portman are talking to one another.  As much as I enjoyed the movie in general, I was always anxious for the next Hutton-Portman scene to take place.  Throw in an excellent musical soundtrack, and you've got yourself some top-notch entertainment.  I will admit that the occasional line did seem a little too far-fetched to be believable, but that is my only quibble with this gem.  It's a must-see.",/review/rw5571053/?ref_=tt_urv

5 August 2006,Geff,10," Lost gem: the best reunion film of them all
","This is one of those lost film gems that somehow comes in under the radar screen and it takes ten years to find it, but I did. The cast is amazing in name and quality. The story line is sensitive and realistic, without a flaw. The scenes are low-key but classic. The relationships are sweet and painful as in real life. The direction is flawless. Some of the lines are not just memorable but classic. Natalie Portman's performance steals the show, which is hard to do with this cast and these incredible performances: Matt Dillon, Noah Emmerich, Annabeth Gish, Lauren Holly, Timothy Hutton, Rosie O'Donnell, Martha Plimpton, Natalie Portman, Michael Rapaport, Mira Sorvino, Uma Thurman. This is a film classic to see and to own. The last scene and the last lines can be watched over and over, especially for the expression on Rappaport's face. I think I'll go and watch it again now. 10 of 10",/review/rw5571053/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2016,PredragReviews,8," ""Let's Walk Through This World Together...""
","This film is hilarious. So enjoyable. Lots of issues being brought to light without making each story line too heavy. Older man liking the very much younger girl, another girl dealing with an eating disorder as her boyfriend is having an affair with a married woman. It's not the story, it's the characters, the words between the thoughts, the spare dialogues, the moments spent among friends, when you stop and reflect on the way your life's going. And it's the basic things in life, friends, girls, past and future. All very lighthearted, no drama, just some vibes. It takes talent to tell a story where nothing great happens It's not a showy movie, but lulls you with well realized set pieces and dilemmas. Rosie O'Donnell's diatribe is fantastic, but it is Natalie Portman's astute turn as Marty that makes the film for me. You truly believe that Willie would fall for this smart 13 old - who wouldn't? She exudes intelligence and vitality and communicates with a man who 'was in 12th(?) grade when she was a zygote' on his level, reducing him to a nervous suitor at points with her wit. The Pooh and Christopher Robin reference is a poignant tool which the actors use to its full potential in this setting. All in all, the film is a quiet pleasure, sketching the difficult, indifferent 20-something decisions of life - do you cling to your youth or move on to the next stage of life willingly? Ted Demme and cast did an admirable job.",/review/rw5571053/?ref_=tt_urv

","Although Ted Demme Â nephew of Jonathan Demme Â has more experience in TV productions - telefilms, teleseries or minis - in Beautiful Girls, which is perhaps not the most appropriate title as it could mislead you to expecting something rather more frivolous, he has managed to put together a memorable film.

21 November 2012,eshwarmail,8," A rare male perspective romantic comedy with a superb spontaneous ensemble performance
","I was actually dreading to watch this movie since most similar genre movies end up to be melodramatic, preachy and finally sappy. My expectation started to turn out true with an irritating opening song through the credits and character introductions, but like the movie - I couldn't get the song out of my head now. Be it Michael Rapaport's unending bickering and whining, suave looks of Uma Thurman and then a masterstroke in a mature than her age teenager role of Natalie Portman. Adding her performance with 'Leon - The Professional', Natalie Portman is yesteryear's Chloe Mortez - but that is being generous for Chloe. Every serious, melodramatic moment has a fresh twist to make it entertaining, every character superbly defined and stay true to their character till the end. It was all in all an excellent ensemble performance from all involved appraising an equally well written script.",/review/rw5571053/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2002,smkjws2,10," Beautiful Girls is absolutely Beautiful
","The greatest thing about Beauitiful Girls is that is a movie that is not devoted to one character.  It is devoted to all of its characters. This movie is very good and it does it all with very very little action. ""Willie Boy""(Timothy Hutton) has come back to his hometown for a high school reunion and to work things out.  While home he finds the most intriguing girl he has ever met, the only problem is she is 12. Meanwhile Willies friends are all involved in relationship problems. Tommy(Matt Dillon) has a steady relationship with his girlfriend but is still having ""fun"" with his high school sweetheart and Paul(Michael Rapaport) and his dog Elle McPherson are lonely because his ex is dating the butcher.  This movie comes together almost perfectly and has standout performances by Rapaport and the young Natalie Portman in the best film of her career.",/review/rw5571053/?ref_=tt_urv

","I often talk about this movie (to anyone that will listen) look at the cast, the writing of the script was above stellar, the casting was above board, and the cast had so much chemistry in this film. This is a movie I have seen about 7 times, and it never gets old. I also think this was one of Matt Dillons best performances. He is one of the most underrated actors and I really hope he gets an Oscar nod someday, he really deserves one. But this movie has it all, it's a great buddy flick, a must see!",/review/rw5571053/?ref_=tt_urv
