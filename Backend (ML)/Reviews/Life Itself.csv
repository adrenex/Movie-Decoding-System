24 September 2019,jon-c-ison,6," Almost ...
","The first part is excellent; touching, creepy, interesting and really very chilling at times. A mix of believable characters and relationships, very well acted. The stage is set perfectly, but unfortunately in the second half the violence somehow undoes the tension already established. It's as if they couldn't resist the temptation to overdo it. Less would have been much more. Rather than build on the psychological and atmospheric creepiness, they throw it away with a rather unimaginative, predictable story arc, where the very dramatic actions feel over the top, and lack impact. A shame, as this really could have been excellent. Nonetheless, worth a watch.",/review/rw4574398/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2019,TheLittleSongbird,6," Twisted reflection
","'Look Away's' main attraction was its premise, maybe not exactly original, the ideas themselves are not new really but it did sound like the film was trying to do something fresh with them. Nonetheless though, it actually sounded very creepy and interesting. Some of 'Look Away' sounded like it could be relatable too. The cover and advertising were attention-grabbing and looked creepy, almost nightmarish, and also like Jason Isaacs quite a lot as an actor.",/review/rw4574398/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2019,zeelu-89550,6," Nice Surprise!
","I caught this on Showtime with time to kill and my expectations were low, but wow, nice surprise. Love the atmospheric feel, and wow India did a great job! For some reason, i thought it may be some kind of Lifetime movie type deal, i was soooo wrong. It kept my attention the whole movie, and with India that's not hard to do. It's worth a watch.",/review/rw4574398/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2019,Lythas_85,4," Great potential but failed nonetheless
",It had indeed great potential. The main character is a loser. Pure and simple. She gets made fun of by pretty much everyone in the school except one guy. The same boy she likes but is banging her female friend.,/review/rw4574398/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," A surprisingly well done low budget psycho-thriller
","Novice (only his 2nd full length film) director, writer and producer Assaf Bernstein did a fantastic job with this film. Outstanding directing and cinematography, perfect score, and great acting by all cast especially India Eisley in her double role. Sure this story has been done before in many different ways, but I still enjoyed the constant thrill and tension throughout - even during the predictable scenes. The set locations (home and school) were great as was the winter scenery. I felt the length was too long for the pacing, and should have been edited down from 103 mins to 80-90 mins. Otherwise a great low budget production by Assaf Bernstein. A well deserved 8/10 from me.",/review/rw4574398/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2022,lavatch,7," Mirror, Mirror, On the Wall!!!
","There is a defining moment in ""Look Away"" when Maria Brennan is sitting in class with her new boyfriend Sean. It has only been days since Maria was responsible for the death of Sean's girlfriend, Lilly. The lecturer is describing Dante's ninth circle of hell in the ""Inferno."" The name of this region is Cocytus where souls are encased in ice. Maria and Sean then leave class and enter into the freezing cold outdoors. Welcome to Cocytus!",/review/rw4574398/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2019,Wizard-8,4," Too long and too slow, among other problems
","I've always had a soft spot for supernatural thrillers that concern tormented outcasts who one day get the power to have revenge and get whatever they long desired. However, this particular telling left me quite unsatisfied. The main problem with the movie is that it tells its story in a manner that's too slow and too long. The first 40% or so of the movie basically shows over and over the crappy life of the lead character. True, it's necessary to show the character's life before the transformation, but the movie basically beats this part of the movie to death while we in the audience are saying, ""Okay, we get it! Get on with it!""",/review/rw4574398/?ref_=tt_urv

14 October 2018,Aktham_Tashtush,8," Unexpectedly bold and surprisingly psychotic
","WOW ,, I didn't really expect it to be that good at first ,, but the plot is somewhat genuine and the events escalate with no dull gabs almost 80% of the movie had that mysterious tense dramatic effect ... the script was a bit short but for a low budget movie the montage, directing and casting .. all exceeded my expectations..",/review/rw4574398/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2019,gustheaffen,3," our daughter has problems is an understatement
","The house, scenery and winter atmosphere were excellent but the story was bland amd boring. For no apparent reason a wealthy attractive girl has no friends except one from childhood and is tormented mercilessly by a fellow student. She basically loses her mind after a traumatic humiliation and has her psycho alter ego ruin or kill everyone around her. And yes the ending was just a cop out. It has been done before and this may have had decent actors but the story was so unrealistic and all over the place and the violence wasn't scary it was just ridiculous. Everyone is terrified of someone 90 lbs soaking wet that somehow manages to off or maim a handful of people.",/review/rw4574398/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2018,claudio_carvalho,6," Disappointing Ambiguous Conclusion

17 July 2019,eventlaunch,5," Pacing and length issue other wise well worth a watch

12 April 2020,mariopilloni,4," Had a lot of potential, just didn't deliver!
","Great cast, great premise but the director needs to reestablish the value of details. The atmosphere was effectively set, the cast did a fantastic job (especially India Eisley) but the director just seemed to neglect the details which impact the overall story. I understand that the beauty of films is it is not restricted to reality but effectively creating a reality you want your audience to be drawn into, is all in the details. Such a wasted project. I saw another review entitled All atmosphere, no substance, perfectly sums it up.",/review/rw4574398/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2018,haroot_azarian,1," WTF did I just watch?
","Ok so I see a lot of positive reviews here. It was a good movie in general, good acting etc. but as for originality, people compared it to Carrie, but I go one further and say that it's been done before, Another Me starring Clare Forlani. the story is practically identical. an identical twin dies during delivery and the star gradually is overtaken by her dead twin blah blah blah.
With this movie, I thought the ending was terrible. she went around a killing spree seeming to not care leave fingerprints behind, and after slitting her dad's throat she goes home and gets in mother's bed and cuddles up and The End? Are the cops from Police Squad or something?",/review/rw4574398/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2018,wisemanfromtowne,1," They're all gonna laugh at you
","For a moment there I thought this film was unwinding to a they're all gonna laugh at you moment, like in the original Carrie film especially the scene at the prom on ice, and I thought all hell would break loose. But this film was nothing but freaky Friday aka Trading places with Micheal Jackson starting with the man in the mirror nonsense. A unhappy girl finds her more confident less compassionate fearless alter ego in the reflection of herself and her alter ego wants out of the reflection to take over her fearful, self conscious starved for affection other self. The story was really OK until the nonsensical killings started, and that's when it went completely downhill. And quite frankly, this concept was stolen right out of the Twilight Zone play book, Nervous man in a four dollar room s2ep3, exact same premise. Like I said it was good until the killings started then it became stupid. And the ending? ....a true WTF moment. Maybe someone else can explain, because I simply didn't get it. By the way, Isaac and Sorvino, were useless.",/review/rw4574398/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2020,robertemerald,8," Creepy and original teen movie
","Look Away at least doesn't keep one in suspense for more than a few minutes, the alter-Maria appearing very early in the piece. For me, it started really well, and for most of the movie was very creepy indeed. There seemed to be a plan, a good one. But at a certain point past the half-way mark that plan seemed to devolve, rather pathetically, into an ordinary girl's very awkward, and rather obsessive, self-pity. This was odd to me, as that's where the trouble began way back in the beginning. Perhaps this was intentional on the part of the writers. It was certainly interesting, and I understand that a story has to have some kind of direction and attempt to be confident. What I really found unappealing was that at first there was a sort of evil cleverness happening that was fun to watch. And then it wasn't clever, just super emotional. Look Away is the sort of movie where you have to judge these things for yourself. Alas, you actually have to get to the end of the movie to find out. If you don't enjoy the direction this movie takes, then you can at least be reassured that this is an original idea, and certainly there are sequences just after the evil twin is let loose that are super classic. I remember a movie once where Merlin told a friend that looking in the future is like eating a biscuit. If you eat it then it's too late, but if you don't you'll never know (I may not remember the exact words!). That's how I feel about Look Away. The mirror scenes could have been spookier perhaps. I am reminded of a movie called The Broken (2008) which featured doppelgängers, and another called Cruel Intentions (1999), which featured, well, teen cruelty. More specifically, you might compare Look Away to a movie such as Carrie (1976, or remake 2013). If you really enjoyed that movie then you'll probably like this.",/review/rw4574398/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2019,alexqueens,4," Everyone Loves an Evil Twin
","In what universe does the skinny girl with model looks get picked on at school? I guess in this one.
But wait, turns out the blonde kendoll popular guy just had the hots for her all along and her only friend who's not-really-her-friend just kept her close to look superior alongside her, despite feeling threatened by her.",/review/rw4574398/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2021,gianmarcoronconi,5," Beautiful idea but the film is not that beautiful
","Beautiful idea, interesting plot but the realization is not the best. In the meantime it is obvious that it is the girl's fault for the things that happen, then it is impossible for anyone to notice her change and the decision to exchange the girl with her twin in the mirror does not make the slightest sense.",/review/rw4574398/?ref_=tt_urv

17 October 2018,jsco5000,4," Just fine but not that good!
",The film was fine but its end was absurd and unfinished story and director and writer were crazy to make the end of the film without value and no sense nor supplement. The film is not suitable for family watching becuse of the abundance of nudity in the film.,/review/rw4574398/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2019,spideryaman,2," The title goes well with what you should do: LOOK AWAY

14 October 2018,Purrz,7," We've been there and done that but yet a surprisingly well done indie film.
","I loved this movie! The motley crew of characters were beautifully portrayed by the cast. From jason Isaacs self indulgent, perfectionism - to Mira Sorvino's disturbing deep-seated sadness and her hunger for her husbands attention - to John C. MacDonald's portrayal of the school bully, who deep inside knows he could never get the attentions of the beautiful Maria. Yes, he was incredibly believable, they all were.

8 December 2018,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,6," Decent teen horror film
",I normally don't like teen horror films but I did not dislike this one. I thought it was well done. India Eisley was very convincing as a very shy high school teen. The plot lacks originality and the film wasted Mira Sorvino acting talent. Jason Isaacs was good. Just didn't like the anti-male vibe to this film. It wasn't necessary. The story has every male at fault for something or another.,/review/rw4574398/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2018,ljulien,8," Nothing New, but Everything's excellent
","As a thriller fanatic, I have to say as I've entitled this, that this movie re-integrates all the codes you have seen previously in this kind of ""mirror and twisted reality"" universe. 
What's good here is the storyline is well built, do not expect jumpscares but instead prepare yourself for some great tension going on. Another great point : All characters have their role and contribution, and btw let salute the acting. I am discovering India Eisley in this movie and can tell this is a pleasant surprise, she carries the film on her shoulder, no doubt about it.
To sum up this is the kind of movie where you hop into within the ten first minutes, and stay stuck until the very end. An enjoyable dark tale, and a nice and wise addition to the genre.",/review/rw4574398/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2019,mbmarsh-05709,4," Could have been really good
","Actors were great but the writing and directing, not so much. A lot of scenes felt over the top, forced, and unbelievable. Like ""That would never really happen that way"" and made me cringe and shake my head. If the writing and directing had been a little more creative and realistic, it could have been a great movie.",/review/rw4574398/?ref_=tt_urv
