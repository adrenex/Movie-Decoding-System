12 July 1999,baumer,9," A powerful movie about not taking life for granted
","It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?",/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2003,eamon-hennedy,10," A gorgeous film.
","A three hour film about death. It doesn't sound like much when you say it like that, but trust me, Meet Joe Black is an outstanding film and is without doubt one of the most underrated little gems I have ever seen. The film is beautiful in every regards; the photography, the sets, the music and the performances, especially the performances. The last time Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt were on screen together it was the equally sublime Legends of the Fall, here it is another sublime film and once again they are putting in some of their best work. The characters that they play, Bill Parrish and Death, bring out a fantastic chemistry between the two performers, especially in the more comedic moments when they two are getting to know each other. However, while death is the main theme of the film, director Martin Brest remembers to filter optimism into his wonderful tale in the shape of a love story between Parrish's daughter (played by the beautiful Claire Forlani) and Death himself. This results in one of the most gorgeous coupling in recent years as well as one of the most erotically intense love scenes I have ever watched.",/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2005,BrandtSponseller,10," A Minimalist Masterpiece
","Somewhere in the netherworld between being a ""remake"" and merely ""inspired by"" Mitchell Leisen's 1934 film Death Takes a Holiday, Meet Joe Black is the story of Death personified. Death takes over the body of Brad Pitt's unnamed character, later donned ""Joe Black"" by William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins). Although the motivation isn't specified but implied in this film, Death wishes to experience the life he normally takes away--he wants to see what it's like to be human. He chooses Parrish to be his guide because Parrish is a hugely successful media mogul who has conviction, strong ""moral fiber"" and insight on life. Compounding the situation, Parrish's daughter, Susan (Claire Forlani), is a woman whom Brad Pitt's unnamed character met in a coffee shop that morning and had an instant mutual attraction with. Black sticks close by William's side through much of the film, creating difficult situations at a time when Parrish's company is trying to deal with a financially attractive but ethically unsavory takeover bid, and he also puts the boil to somewhat strained familial relationships.",/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2008,bkoganbing,8," The Grim Reaper On Sabbatical
","The old Paramount classic Death Takes A Holiday gets a stylish turn of the 21st century remake, Meet Joe Black with Brad Pitt as the grim reaper himself taking a sabbatical to experience what he deprives everyone of, ultimately. The story has been updated from Italy during World War I to America in the new age of information.",/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2020,fredschepers,10," 22 years later. And it still knocks you out.
","Film reviews are irrelevant. Perception is key. Meet Joe Black is a meet on its own. If you are not into romantic tear jerkers, watch this film and find out that your human and have the ability to change your mind. I speak from experience. The story: Simple and easy to understand. The director made a simple life event into a magical experience. Love and death go hand in hand in a mixture of sublime acting, awesome sceneries, superb dialogues, nerve touching details and result in a romantic drama where the sadness and emotions do not cover the happy ending and leaves you choked till the last over the rainbow tune ends. After 40 years of watching thousands of films, this film still is my number 1 film in my top 100 films where all one hundred share the first place. Brad Pitt, Sir Anthony Hopkins (brilliant classical composer btw) and the gorgeous Claire Forlany showed of their qualities. Same for all the other participants in thisepic story about how life will go on. Perception. ... but from my pov their best acting ever. I have seen it at least once every 2 years. If it will be your first time, settle for it. If you are still young, and think you become a film addict, be aware! You will get drawn in this film for decades to come. Enjoy this experience. And let it knock you out as well ☺",/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2005,Lechuguilla,8," Reflective And Philosophical
","For a long time I put off watching this, because I have no interest in superficial, teen comedy flicks, as implied by the film's pedestrian title and by the casting of a youthful Brad Pitt. But ""Meet Joe Black"" is anything but ""superficial"", and ""teen comedy"" does not describe this movie at all.",/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv

5 December 1998,Verbal-17,10," A wonderful celebration of life and love that is no less than Oscar-worthy
","I went to this movie not expecting all that much.  However, I was amazed by the way it slowly creeps up on you, and delivers such an emotional wallop that when it was over I decided that Saving Private Ryan was the only movie that has come out this year that was more powerful than this movie.  Anthony Hopkins again astounds the movie-going world with one of his best performances, and he deserves an Oscar.  One of the reasons that I think this movie has not gotten the attention it deserves is due to timing: it came out soon after What Dreams May Come, a movie with similar themes. However, while that movie mostly depended on special effects, this movie has very little special effects, but has easily twice the emotional power.  I highly recommend it to anyone who may have overlooked it- you will not be disappointed.",/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2016,Kirpianuscus,," seductive
","first, for the interesting idea who, far to be original, has the chance to be used in wise manner. than , for the romanticism and the great chemistry between Forlani and Pitt. not the least, and that is far to represent a surprise, the performance of Anthony Hopkins is admirable. the Death and the price of each new day of life. the media industry as the best set. the discoveries of significance of small, fundamental things who defines the existence. and the price of happiness. its virtue - to be a provocation for viewer in each scene. sure, the old romantic story is the same, but its nuances transform the sense of old clichés and lovely sweet images. a new Faust. only the roles are for different interpreters. the essence is the same. but the answer seems be different.",/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2019,bostockleigh-75918,10," A true benchmark in film making
","In protest to all the remade junk Hollywood is producing these days, I'm watching a movie that's as good to watch the 10th time as it was the first (and I speak from experience).
This movie is a tribute to all who came together in it's making. It's Claire Forlani's finest hour, Brad Pitt is superb and Anthony Hopkins is brilliant to name a few. If you've never watched it, I challenge you: It will melt your heart, and it will become a standard. Hats off to the screenwriters who adapted the story so well, to the actors who plainly put their hearts into this, to wardrobe, lighting, scenery who put everything in place, and most of all to the Director who had a passionate and clear vision of what he wanted from every scene.",/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2019,UniqueParticle,10," Very engaging, compelling, and thought-provoking!
","One of the the most philosophically intriguing experiences I've found. Quite awkward at times but so genuine and normal feeling. Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins are riveting! Rebirth, romance, death, business, activities, and perplexity all astonishing parts of this unique art piece in this cinema. Also the director Martin Brest is great especially for films like Midnight Run and Beverly Hills Cop, I highly recommend Meet Joe Black to anyone!!",/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2017,Bored_Dragon,9," Beautiful
","This movie had no luck with critics, but it is near the top of my all-time favorites. One of the most beautiful love stories, with deep thoughts about life, and with Pitt and Hopkins in leading roles you can't ask for much more.",/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2014,SnoopyStyle,4," Susan doesn't make sense
","Media mogul Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) is close to his 65th birthday. He has two daughters Susan (Claire Forlani) and Allison (Marcia Gay Harden). Allison is busy planning the celebration. Susan is a medical resident who is in a passionless relationship with Drew (Jake Weber). William tells Susan that he likes Drew as a business underling but he doesn't sense that she truly loves him. He urges her to find true love. In a diner, she meets a young flirtatious man (Brad Pitt). He seems to melt her heart but unbeknownst to her, he is killed crossing a street. Bill keeps hearing a voice which is Death who comes to visit and learn from Bill. He takes on the name Joe Black.",/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2000,Rammstein-2,9," The stuff that legends are made from
","This film caught me off-guard. I wasn't prepared for the impact it had on me. A wonderful sensation permeates this story in which Death takes a body to wear (I would like to choose too...) to discover what its like to be a human being. Hopkins and Pitt act like they've never done anything else - they are brilliant. If you doubt my words, watch the first 15 minutes and tell me: don't you get goose bumps when Hopkins hears Death whisper in his ear? I sure did. I hail this film as one of the best - ever.",/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv

11 December 2002,PoorSlobWithoutAName,," A Truly Enchanting Movie!
","Meet Joe Black is a beautiful film with a talented cast.  Because it is unique, the plot enables humor to be weaved within the dramatic and romantic elements.  The music, composed by Thomas Newman (Shawshank Redemption, Erin Brokovich) truly enhances the movie.  The many string and piano melodies are beautiful, and fit smoothly. There are so many memorable moments, like father-daughter conversations, and the scene in the coffee shop. Brad Pitt, in his portrayal of Death,displays naive and vulnerable feelings, skillfully in sharp contrast his behavior at the beginning of the film.  While some criticize its length and unrealistic aspects of the plot, I found it to be so captivating and quite well-made.  Meet Joe Black has an indescribable effect on me whenever I watch it. The story of Death being apprentice to a respected, accomplished man makes one realize the simple beauties of life-- passion, family, love... and peanut butter.",/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2005,jimmyolsenblues,10," The perfect movie when you are alone on Valentine's Day
","This is a really great movie , that you have to watch glimpses of first. You have to see parts , you have to be non-interested, ""oh this is just another bad brad Pitt movie"", but you watch parts over and over , because Anthony Hopkins is one of the greatest actors of all time. I can't believe watching this movie on Valentine's day how empathetic Anthony Hopkins is , how terrible he is as Hannibal Lechter. This is a great movie, you must come to love. You must watch it and think nothing of it. Then watch it again some time later, you will begin to understand it. You will begin to understand how wonderful this movie, How true it is. How absolutely real and caring the movie is. It combines life, death, love, and greed for all things. To love someone and what love is , truly is defined in the movie. It is a wonderful movie to watch on Valentine's Day when you are alone, when nothing is clear, when you are in the dumps have no one, when pain is all you feel and all your loved ones are separated by time and space. When I was alone today Feb 14th 2005, I enjoyed this movie, I suggest you watch so you too can not be alone.",/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2020,imseeg,9," For the Romance, For the Romance, For the Romance !!!
","I am a guy. I dont like sentimental romantic movies. This movie is full blown romance though from the very start, but I was still smitten with it. Not only was I smitten with it, I was dumbfounded, touched and mesmerised as well by it. Why? How could I be so touched by a romantic movie? BECAUSE ANTHONY HOPKINS IS BRILLIANT. And so are all the other actors, and so is the music, and so is the photography and so is the story, simply MAGNIFICENT.",/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2016,ilovedavii,10," For the Romantics Out There
","This movie is spectacular. It's 3 hours long, and without any ""action."" It is simply a study of life and relationships (familial, friendly, romantic, etc.). These relationships are studied by Death, who is taking a vacation. He wants to see what all the fuss is about life. This is an entity who constantly witnesses the end of life, but wants to understand what comes before that end; why do people get so emotional when lit's their time?",/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2004,lmoore520,," In short, an excellent and not too long film
","Whenever this film is aired, I'm drawn to watch it. The pace, like life, is slow. Some people find this to be a problem. I feel sorry for those people; maybe they've been so saturated by ""fast food"" films and reality TV that they think that's the way life is supposed to be. Unlike life, the film has no ""wasted space"". So, while it may seem too long for theatre viewing, it's plenty short for sitting back in an easy chair for three hours and just letting it draw you in--with the excellent dialogue (including the Patois), excellent performances by truly talented actors, and above all the [again] excellent score by Mr. Newman. If you're a romantic not just about love, but also about life, then treat yourself and watch it.",/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv

16 May 2021,myronlearn,6," Meet Joe Black For Three Long Hours
","With rare ex exceptions, no movie should be over 2 hours long. This one is three and should have been cut way down. Bad editing. The film itself is pretty good, but slow moving at times. There were points when I was losing interest. Anthony Hopkins steals the show as he usually does. However, it could have been so much better if it's length was properly cut.",/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2020,Nemesis42,10," Brilliant.
",A powerhouse masterpiece. Nothing is out of place in this story. It's brilliant. The emotions build up relentlessly towards the finale. We the viewers know a secret that most of the characters in the film don't. That fact contributes to a head on collision between the film and us relating to the concept of knowing who we are and promotes the notion that we shouldn't lie to ourselves or others. This 'known' secret also causes some mighty emotion to orbit and tug us away. So well done.,/review/rw5136355/?ref_=tt_urv
