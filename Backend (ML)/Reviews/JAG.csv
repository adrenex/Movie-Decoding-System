8 November 2010,neji107,7," Morning Glory - refreshingly sweet
","Rachel McAdams leads the way in this surprisingly refreshing flick as the workaholic television show producer, Becky, who lands the job of organizing ""the worst morning show ever"". She only has a short time to save the show's plummeting ratings, and in doing so must battle with low worker morale, conceited anchors, poor working conditions, as well as her own inadequacy in dealing with guy-problems. Desperate for a change, she recruits the legendary newscaster Mike Pomeroy, played by Harrison Ford, who is less than willing to cover any story he does not consider ""worthy of his reputation"".",/review/rw4224443/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's no secret that people go to see movies touted as being comedies for one reason, they want it to be funny and thereby make them feel a little better, or at least lighten their mood. That's what I was looking for when I went in to see this film. Thankfully, I was rewarded with more feel good value than I had paid for. This film is terrific entertainment.",/review/rw4224443/?ref_=tt_urv

","At a loss of what to do, on a whim, I decided to go to the cinema. Being the opening night of 'Black Swan', I decided to leave that particular feature for another day. There were a few horrors, a few kids movies and then there was Morning Glory. ",/review/rw4224443/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2010,puffball97,7," Fun Satire of the Morning News
","""Daybreak"" pokes pleasant fun at today's 3 morning TV shows and the ins and outs of it and the world of television news broadcasting. It portrays all types of news and society archetypes - the ambitious young TV producer fired from her local TV station who wants higher ratings (Rachel McAdams), the brash, no-nonsense, seasoned and substantial anchorman (Harrison Ford), the perky female anchorman who smiles at everything yet is not completely comfortable working with an anchor who doesn't smile (Diane Keaton), the comical weatherman who breezes through forecasts and does humorous on-air stunts (Matt Malloy), the producer's boss who gets angry when things don't go well (Jeff Goldblum), the on-the-job boyfriend who wishes the producer wouldn't take her job too seriously (Patrick Wilson), the sexually charged younger anchor who the producer fires right away before hiring her the more seasoned veteran anchorman (Ty Burrell), and the producer's mother in a small part who makes her aware of today's unemployment and downsizing (Patti D'Arbanville). All these people and much more elements make up ""Morning Glory"" and tells us about the world that we live in today.",/review/rw4224443/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2011,Chrysanthepop,," ""What's The Story?""
","Finally a comedy from Hollywood that is both refreshing and funny. Rachel McAdams leads 'Morning Glory' as a workaholic TV producer who finally gets a break...but with the 'worst morning show'. Now she only has little time to save the show from tanking and this is much more difficult than what she had anticipated as she has to deal with various obstacles and chaos. In the hope of a solution, she manages to recruit renowned news anchor Mike Pomeroy but that only makes her work more difficult.",/review/rw4224443/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2011,clh-1,6," Cookie Cutter, but Cute
","In that time between summer blockbusters and the full-on Oscar blitz is time for Hollywood to take a breather. Sometimes the audience takes a breather too. And that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Here we meet Becky Fuller, trying to make the jump from local to network news show producer. She is put in charge of an ailing morning program, and when told that it is on its last leg, she takes the novel and bizarre step of forcing well-respected television journalist Mike Pomeroy into the co-host position via a quirk of his contract. and thus they are off toward saving the show... A plot like this doesn't really have much in the way of surprises. What really matters is how well the characters are written and how well the actors play their respective parts. While none of the cast is terrible, standing out are a low-key Jeff Goldblum, playing a cynical network executive. While an over stated, loud performance would have sufficed, Goldblum plays it a pragmatic working guy. He gets in a few good zingers early on though. The other standout is Harrison Ford. While he hasn't had much success in the field, he is actually very good at comedy usually playing the straight man to what is going on around him. Here he plays the gruffly lovable curmudgeon pretty well. A significant part of the the plot is his character's personal growth. On the whole, Morning Glory isn't going to sweep any of the major awards, but it's a gentle way to pass two hours and get a few good laughs in the process.",/review/rw4224443/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2010,Aliceart,8," Sparkly Grumpy People
","Rachel McAdams is taking the lead this time in a rom-com that adds a little pathos, shows the rest of the world what it's like to be totally committed to a job (being a former workaholic, I can totally relate to this.) The pace is set at ""sprint"" and actually does a great job of going the distance. 10 cuts above a sit-com, but could possibly be turned into a very successful one about a fictional struggling #4 slot on the network morning show circuit. Adding to the mix and a lot of credibility, Jeff Goldblum, Dianne Keaton, and Harrison Ford, looking every bit his 60+ years, but still has a boyishness to his demeanor that hearkens back to Star Wars and Indiana Jones. Patrick Wilson is the rom in ""rom-com"" and he holds his ground against the whirling dervishness of Rachel's character. The writing is outstanding and the one-liners, priceless. Check it out.",/review/rw4224443/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2010,mbalderson-1,9," Not what I expected but very funny
",I just came from a screening of this movie. I went in thinking total chick flick and came away quite impressed. There is a love story but it doesn't take up the whole movie and get heavy with it. The movie more centers around an up and coming producer of a local TV morning show that ends up at the lowest rated nationally syndicated morning show. what entails is a humorous tale of trying to get the shows ratings up.,/review/rw4224443/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2019,tabuno,9," A Compelling Ensemble Effort in This Career Comedy
","28 November 2010. Following in the footsteps of the DEVIL WEARS PRADA (2006), MORNING GLORY minus the boss from hell, presents an unusually strong ensemble movie with three A-Class stars, Harrison Ford, Diane Keaton, and Jeff Goldblum that supports Rachel McAdams in the starring role. What makes this working career comedy shine is how the stellar cast doesn't have to rely on singular Oscar winning performances to present a well balanced, nicely nuanced film about the morning news industry (much like the fashion design of DEVIL WEARS PRADA) and the fascinating, compelling look at the crazy behind the scenes personality and employment difficulties experienced by those in the industry. It says a lot about Harrison, Keaton, and Goldblum when they can act without having to upstage the movie, only to make it a such a strong, balanced movie. Rachel McAdams brings her own peculiar character flaws and physical antics without making into a dumb slapstick portrayal like Chevy Chase in Fletch (1985) and Fletch Lives (1989) which speaks to the talent of McAdams. The movie also avoids getting off track, off message by resisting the temptation to fall into the evil persona subplots often included in romantic comedies. Tucked into this movie is a message movie about balance and the compelling movement towards the climax of the movie is nicely extended and prolonged more than almost any other movie than perhaps the long building action sequences of INCEPTION (2010). The employment anxiety, stress, the personality conflicts are presented well, a tribute to this movie in that it was sustained with the delicious wonderful soundtrack that helped to enhance DEVIL WEARS PRADA. One of the most complete, superior movie of its genre of the year. A very timely and pertinent movie with an important lesson about life.",/review/rw4224443/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2010,mdtscoates,8," Thank you bright morning for your splendor!
","Morning Glory is a splendid work of film making, comprised of a winning storyline and characters we come to care about. Hats off to the writers, as the script really gives the movie a shot of adrenaline and reels you in. I consider it one of the year's finer comedies in an environment where abrasive humor seems to draw people in droves. What Morning Glory isn't is a romantic comedy or a ""chick flick"", as what we are tending to see on the previews. Rather, a story of an executive producer determined to turn around a dying TV show in comic fashion.",/review/rw4224443/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2011,harry_tk_yung,," Melodramatic to the bones, yet delightfully so
","The movie opens by losing no time in introducing career-focuses Becky (Rachel McAdams), young and yet experienced TV show producer with a station at New Jersey. When a promotion opportunity opens but she is not only passed over but let go to make room for a newcomer with lofty academic credentials but no experience, she gets immediately into a whirlwind of job-hunting, finally landing one as the producer of a last-place morning show in New York.",/review/rw4224443/?ref_=tt_urv

","I can understand when a single big name actor signs on to a dreadful movie for the sake of a paycheque. Why not? I do wonder, though, when three veteran and fairly big name actors do it. Harrison Ford? Diane Keaton? Jeff Goldblum? OK. I'm not huge fans of any of them and I've had mixed reactions to their work over the years, but I can't deny that they're pretty big names - and they signed on for this. Did they not read the script beforehand and realize how pathetic this was?",/review/rw4224443/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2010,kiokatt,9," Motivational and Funny Movie!
","I saw the screening of this movie last night and was pleasantly surprised that this was not another ""chick flick"". The story focuses around a young female producer that is hard working and hoping to get her dream job of Executive Producer (EP) of a well known TV morning show. Instead, she is accepted into the EP position on a failing TV morning show. Dedicated to her career, which was her dream since age 8, she has little time for men and romance. As the story progresses she has countless obstacles she must overcome and a high amount of stress that comes with the job. There are many comical scenes as the producer is practically at wits end during the main duration of the movie. She doesn't seem to lose her cool much of the movie, and when she does become infused with anger or passion she is constructive in using it to complete her job. This is a feel good story that shows with hard work, dedication (following a dream since age 8!), a bit of luck, and having faith in yourself, you can accomplish your goals. A nice change from the current female lead characters currently out there.",/review/rw4224443/?ref_=tt_urv

","If not for Rachel McAdams always watchable enthusiasm, this movie would totally sink. I usually love her in anything she does but even she couldn't save this very strained very weak comedy. What a waste of a good cast. Harrison is just a terrible grumpy old man. What is he doing in this movie? Diane Keaton shouldn't have done such a shrill and desperate looking role - its beneath her stature. Patrick Wilson looks ill at ease.",/review/rw4224443/?ref_=tt_urv

She's been one of the more underrated actresses out there, excelling in supporting roles for years which finally lead up to her Academy Award nomination for Spotlight. This movie came out awhile ago and while it's definitely a for the masses type of film, it's worth revisiting because of Rachel and Harrison's respective work, they're hilarious together.",/review/rw4224443/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. It would be easy to dismiss this film as typical lighthearted Hollywood fluff that carries no real message (other than a 2 hour escape). The interesting thing is that it's really not an escape - we are tossed right into the workaday world of a manic TV producer. Additionally, though it has plenty of light moments, it also carries a bit of depth in breaking down a couple of lead characters.",/review/rw4224443/?ref_=tt_urv
