6 August 2000,CuriosityKilledShawn,4," It's a Beverly HIlls Flop
","The early 90s were not kind to Eddie Murphy. Paramount butchered Another 48 Hours in the editing room, audiences turned their noses up at Boomerang, and almost nobody even bothered with The Distinguished Gentleman. Eddie had lost his pulling power and decided to go back to the role that made him a superstar. But 1994 just wasn't the right moment as most of the cast and crew were busy, leaving very little in the way of continuity. Several scripts came and went, and what we finally got was a lame 'Die Hard in a Theme Park' story.",/review/rw2432895/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2009,ma-cortes,5," Inferior third part of the trilogy about Axel Foley-Eddy Murphy as freelance cop

26 September 2016,Tweekums,5," The weakest of the 'Beverly Hills Cop' trilogy
","This instalment opens in Detroit with Axel preparing to raid a local chop-shop; he hasn't bothered getting SWAT support as the group is known not to use weapons unfortunately just before Axel's raid takes place another group of criminals has turned up and killed everybody in the chop-shop to retrieve a van that we later learn contained the paper used to make $50 bills. Instead of unarmed men the police find themselves up against machinegun toting heavies. Foley's boss, Inspector Todd is killed and Axel is determined to find the man who did it. Not surprisingly what little evidence there is points to Los Angeles; this time to a theme park, Wonderworld, where the head of security is the man who killed Todd unfortunately Axel will have a hard job proving it as he is a pillar of the local community. Once in LA Axel is reunited with Det. Sgt Billy' Rosewood and also meets Serge again, the art gallery he worked in has closed and now he is selling 'luxury' firearms. When Axel goes into Wonderworld he discovers what is going on but he will have a hard job proving it.",/review/rw2432895/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2010,TheLittleSongbird,4," Has its moments but it is a disappointment
","While I was disappointed with this movie overall, it does have its moments. Hector Elizondo adds some genuine quirkiness, the car chase set-piece is impressive, there is the odd fun visual joke and the production values are pretty good. However, there are a lot of things that make this film for me the weakest of the three. The story is very unoriginal and predictable, the script is pretty poor, John Landis gives one of his weaker directorial jobs, the film isn't as assuredly paced and neither Eddie Murphy or Judge Reinhold come across as likable this time around. Overall, I wouldn't say it was a complete disaster but it is a big disappointment compared to the wonderful original.(the second was disappointing too but watchable) 4/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2432895/?ref_=tt_urv

12 May 2007,lastliberal,6," Axel, you on a coffee break? Go get that sonofabitch.
","You would think that anyone who could do the hilarious Amazon Women on the Moon would be a good director. Sorry, Mr Landis, but you blew it on this one.",/review/rw2432895/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2002,soranno,," Good but pales in comparison to its predecessors
","Eddie Murphy's third outing as Detroit police detective Axel Foley who seems to have made more of a crime fighting contribution to Beverly Hills still generates some power in the series but the first two films are naturally the better ones. The film inexplicably removes the John Taggart (John Ashton) and Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox) characters from the series and adds a shallow new character named John Flint (Hector Elizondo). Fortunately, Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) is still around and he still manages to be a perfect foil for Foley. Foley's third case in Beverly Hills is a little improbable but the action scenes help to make up for the plot which has to do with Foley matching wits with a corrupt head of security (Timothy Carhart) at a popular Beverly Hills amusement park called WonderWorld (a creation of Paramount Parks). The park character costumes and designs are nice and colorful and Theresa Randle helps to pick things up as a potential love interest for Foley but the film doesn't give Murphy very many funny lines and that is a disappointment if one wants to label this film as a comedy. The action is as usual great but Murphy is reknowned as a comedy star and the lack of laughs here prevent this from being a perfect series. Still, it's a very good series.",/review/rw2432895/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2021,SimonJack,4," The last of the series falls way short
","""Beverly Hills Cop III"" is the last film of a series that began 10 years earlier. New film star, Eddie Murphy, was a popular comedian who was beginning to hit and miss with his films by this time. Watching this movie again these years later, I could see the decline. This one still fared well at the box office, but nothing like the first two films. This year was a year for some great and many very good movies, including some comedies and animated films.",/review/rw2432895/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2003,DunnDeeDaGreat,6," The worst in a once promosing series
",Beverly Hills Cop III is the worst in what was a promosing action comedy franchise. Murphy was in a carrer slump and I guess he made this film to help out his carrer but it didn't help just sunk it deeper. The film is full of mistakes such as the loss of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckhiemer a weak script and a lack of action. John Landos who worked with Murphy before and made good films fails here. The film needed a good action director like Renny Harlin or Dwight H. Little or even Karthyn Bigelow. Skip this one even if you're a die hard Murphy fan.,/review/rw2432895/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2018,max-frank,5," Very weak
","I don't know what I expected when I started watching this movie, but I was definitely let down by miles. First of all the dialogue is so bad and cheese, that it sometimes physically hurt to watch. The killing in this movie just takes away from the comedy , and believe me there is loads of killing it. Another negative factor is, that for some unexplainable reason someone thought it was a good idea to make every flame in this movie a bright blue colour, which sometimes really hurts while watching in a dark room. That being said there are some scenes that I found genuinely funny, although most of the time this was unintentional like in action scenes or scenes that where supposed to be serious and dramatic.",/review/rw2432895/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2002,Victor Field,," The heat is not on the street this time... or anywhere else.
","Eddie Murphy called the original ""Beverly Hills Cop"" his best movie after ""48 Hrs.,"" and with good reason; the first sequel wasn't as good but it certainly had its moments. But for ""Beverly Hills Cop III""... well, I never thought I'd say this, but where are Simpson and Bruckheimer when you need them? Not to mention Ronny Cox, John Ashton and John Landis when he was good? (In 1996 Landis had the unfortunate task of having to come to Britain to promote his movie ""The Stupids"" - unfortunate because it opened here the same day as ""Independence Day,"" with predictably horrific consequences. I felt very sorry for how he was reduced to stuff like that... and this.)",/review/rw2432895/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2001,john_oneill41,1," Weakest of the three
","The third installment in the Beverley Hills Cop trilogy is by far the weakest of the three. The first problem is that there isn't even s starting theme tune. The whole feel of the movie is much more slapstick than the first two and ads a result it feels very superficial. With the first there was a feeling that this could possibly happen in real life, but this film is just too silly. Practically none of the regulars are there: Todd's there but he is killed in the first five minutes, there is no sign of Bogomil, Taggart is briefly mentioned as having retired and Jeffrey's not there either. There is much more killing here, which is another unbelievable element. Have said all that it does have a few funny moments, especially from Serge. It's not the worst film ever made, but it's nowhere near as good as the first two in the series and indeed doesn't even feel like a Beverley Hill Cop movie.",/review/rw2432895/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2002,LuboLarsson,1," Very disappointing
","At one time John Landis made great films, Animal House, An American Werewolve in London, Trading Places etc, at one time Eddie Murphy made great films, Beverly Hills Cop, 48 Hrs, Trading Places and Coming to America, sadly they also made this, a travesty and an insult to the brilliant original. I don't blame Eddie, but he has nothing to work with here, the script is lame, the story is pathetic and it just doesn't FEEL or LOOK like a Beverly Hills Cop film. A lot of the key personnel from the first two wisely chose to miss out on this one, 7 years after Beverly Hills Cop II and this is the best they could come up with, thats mind boggling ***3/10***",/review/rw2432895/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2005,policy134,1," Not enough Murphy wisecracks and only dull action scenes
","How could they make one more than two films in this series? The Beverly Hills Cop movies is a sign to moviegoers everywhere that putting a big star in whatever familiar thing he has done to death already, and way better by the way, is a total lack of originality. If they had only made the darn thing funny at least but John Landis, who is usually pretty dependable as a comedy director, seems more interested in putting cameos by directors in every scene, so it will at least be something that you can kill the time spotting.",/review/rw2432895/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2021,classicsoncall,7," ""I love you Oki-Doki!""
","This film doesn't get high marks from IMDb viewers, but I think I liked it just a tad better than the sequel just prior. I did miss Sergeant Taggart a little since he retired from the Beverly Hills police force, and considering his insubordination in the first two movies of the franchise, seeing Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) promoted was somewhat surprising, but given the span of time involved, it probably makes sense. Hector Elizondo fills in admirably to replace the Taggart character as detective Jon Flint. The presence of Bronson Pinchot as Serge was welcome, he always manages to provide a good dose of humor in those pictures he appears in. The idea that he traded in his art gallery stint for dealing in luxury personal weaponry was wonderfully ironic. The setting of Wonder Land in the picture automatically makes you think of Disneyland, but this was filmed at Paramount's Great America Amusement Park for those particular scenes, and it was fitting that Eddie Murphy took his undercover work seriously enough to dress up as Oki-Doki to help flush out the villains of the piece. With a potential romantic interest thrown in, detective Axel Foley helps the Beverly Hills Police Force solve a crime one more time, this time to avenge the murder of his boss back in Detroit. Having watched the complete franchise on successive days, I'm now prepared for ""Beverly Hills Cop IV"" almost three full decades since this sequel, plus an additional decade removed from the original. Just proves you can't keep a good cop down.",/review/rw2432895/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2019,pmtelefon,3," Pretty Bad
","""Beverly Hills Cop III"" is not a very good movie. Considering the talent involved, it's a surprisingly bad movie. John Landis has a better batting average than any other director in my lifetime. And yes, I'm including Steven Spielberg. He directed ""Animal House"", ""The Blues Brothers"", ""An American Werewolf in London"", etc. Eddie Murphy is a borderline genius. He should have been nominated at least three more times for Oscars beside ""Dream Girls"". He should have been nominated for ""The Nutty Professor"", ""Bowfinger"" and, forgive me, ""48hrs"". Throw in screenwriter Steven de Souza (""48hrs"", ""Die Hard"", ""Die Hard 2"" and many more) and what could wrong? A lot. ""Beverly Hills Cop III"" feels like a rushed project for the summer season. Eddie Murphy is a great talent but he seems to be on auto-pilot in this one.",/review/rw2432895/?ref_=tt_urv

23 May 2011,zardoz-13,5," The Least Inspired ""Beverly Hills Cop"" sequel!!!
","This uninspired sequel about a counterfeit ring operating in a Walt Disney look-alike amusement park qualifies as the least entertaining entry in the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" franchise. After producing ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop 2,"" Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer had nothing to do with this pathetic Paramount release that unimaginatively drags Detroit Detective Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy of ""48 HRS"") back to California for the third time. You can tell when a franchise has run out of momentum because it starts knocking off its own characters. Further, neither Taggart (John Ashton of the first two ""Beverly Hills Cop"" movies) nor Capt. Bogamill (Ronny Cox of the first two Beverly Hills Cop"" movies) return. Nothing is ever said about Bogamill's absence, but we're told that Taggart has retired. Indeed, nobody replaces Bogamill, but franchise newcomer Hector Elizondo appears to be John Ashton's replacement. Let's not forget Paul Reiser's character Det. Jeffrey Friedman who is conspicuous by his absence. Not even witty Bronson Pinchot can rekindle the magic with his English-language challenged foreigner, Serge, who no longer works at an art gallery, has concocted what he refers to as a firearms boutique. Sadly, this is one sequel that shouldn't have been made. Although the stunt work is exemplary in the Spider Ride park scene, the recurring firefights between our hero and the trigger-happy villains conjure up neither suspense nor tension. ""Beverly Hills Cop 3"" recycles one of the most deplorable movie clichés. Specifically, the well-armed villains cannot hit the side of a barn with their machine guns. Axel's one-liners and the dialogue are both forgettable. Murphy doesn't field many laughs and looks idiotic wandering around in an elephant costume.",/review/rw2432895/?ref_=tt_urv
