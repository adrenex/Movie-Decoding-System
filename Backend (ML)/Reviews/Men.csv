","I'd say this is one of the best kids movies ever! I never get sick of Good Burger I've seen it so many times, such a good feel film and great mindless fun! Not an Oscar type which is ok sometimes. I love the characters, whacky scenes, cinematography is decent, and the comedy is on point.",/review/rw5421517/?ref_=tt_urv

","I must admit that when I sat down to watch this 1997 movie titled ""Good Burger"" I wasn't really having much of any high expectations or hopes for the movie. But still, it being a movie that I hadn't already seen was sufficient to make me give the movie a chance.",/review/rw5421517/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2004,movieguy1021,7," Good Burger: 7/10
","Movies from TV shows almost always never work. It's even worse when a movie is based off of a skit from Saturday Night Live. So it's no wonder people were less than inviting when Good Burger came about, a movie based off of a skit from a kids version of SNL that airs on Nickelodeon. Seeing as I used to be a big fan of All That, I decided to give Good Burger another go-round, to see if its juvenile humor still stood up throughout the years. And it did.",/review/rw5421517/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2008,cabasaexpert351,8," When you mess with Good Burger...you go in the Grinder!
",I absolutely love this movie. It is very stupid but very funny. Ed is an employee at Good Burger who doesn't have a lot of common sense which makes him very lovable and extremely funny. Dexter is the costar with Ed who is a somewhat spoiled high school student who learns the ethics of hard work and in good friendship. The storyline is pretty simple and a bit ridiculous but it adds to the humor. A new fast food joint has opened up across the street from Good Burger and become a huge competition for Good Burger but there is something not right with this new fast food restaurant though no one can quite put their finger on it. This movie is guaranteed to keep you laughing the whole way through.,/review/rw5421517/?ref_=tt_urv

1 August 2001,Op_Prime,," The second Nick feature a winner!
","This 1997 movie is based on a hilarious sketch from the series, All That. Well, Good Burger is just as hilarious on the big screen as it is on the small screen. Even though this movie was marketed as a kid's film, it can really be enjoyed by all ages. The plot is simple and has it's flaws, but that doesn't hurt the movie. Just sit back and relax, and you're sure to enjoy this movie. The movie is funny mainly due to it's stars, Kenan and Kel. They have an excellent chemistry together and are a great comedy team.

17 June 2000,i.like.midgets,," Cinematography in its finest hour
","It is such a rare occasion that a film in this day and age can touch the viewer in only the way that a masterpiece like Good Burger can. When I sit back in my chair and reminisce about cinema at its best I think of Casablanca, Lawrence of Arabia, The Godfather, Citizen Cane, and Gone With the Wind. These films all speak to the viewer in a way that most other films can only dream of. They reach out to you touch you deep down in your heart... and in you soul. It's a feeling that transcends all the cultural norms and traditions of today, a feeling that is so much more lasting and fulfilling, one that is undeniable to even the most critical of movie-goers. Good Burger does this and so much more. Not since Weekend At Bernie's has a movie stirred up such strong emotions, such feelings, ones that speak to me on a level of truth that is hard to find in society today.",/review/rw5421517/?ref_=tt_urv

","This 1997 comedy stars Kel Mitchell and Kenan Thompson. Thompson (SNL) plays Dexter, a teen who is ready for Summer vacation. His plans drastically change, when he crosses paths with dim-witted teen, Ed (Mitchell). Ed works at local fast food joint, ""Good Burger"" and helps Dexter get a job working there after causing Dexter's car accident. They eventually become friends and learn that new competitor across the street, ""Mondo Burger"" is using illegal, growth substances in their meat to boom business. Ed and Dexter try to stop it and save their establishment from going out of business. Sinbad, Abe Vigoda, Shaquille O'Neal, George Clinton and Carmen Electra also appear. This isn't a bad film with some funny and corny moments I recommend.",/review/rw5421517/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's a FUN movie! As college educated parents of a 12 year old and a 5 year old, this is one of our favorites and I registered with IMDb just to comment on this movie since everyone else seems to be slamming it. Loads of fun but not for anyone looking for ""good theater"". It's pure silliness for kids; with bad logic and improbable plot lines, and the kids are of course the heroes. So if you are just looking for some plain clean fun to watch with your kids, I suggest this one! And there's no dancing bears or singing furniture (but, there are flying, talking hamburgers...) So here's the scoop, if you want an educational show for your kids, go elsewhere. But if you want to sit down, eat popcorn and laugh, get this one.",/review/rw5421517/?ref_=tt_urv

Some people don't get it, and others don't like it. But in order to fully appreciate this film you have to know the humor of Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell, and watch All That.

Well I was definitely an easily amused kid because oh my goodness is this ridiculous in every way. While Ed is lovably stupid, the jokes aren't funny at all.

24 May 2021,TheHonestCritic,8," Is ""Good Burger"" a good film? Or, is it an overcooked mess? Check out my review below to find out!
","""Good Burger"" (1997), this movie opens the door right back to my childhood. Now, I did not see it in a theater, as I was only five at the time. But, I remember when I first got it on video tape and watched it. I loved it right away! When I first saw it, I remember being completely invested and laughing all the way through. This film is based off the famous ""Good Burger"" sketch from the Nickelodeon TV show, ""All That"" (1994-present) and it's also based on the Nickelodeon TV show, ""Kenan & Kel"" (1996-2000). So, in a way, it ended up being a cool crossover! In the sketch ""Good Burger"", Kenan was rarely involved with Kel during those skits. But, he was still involved with Kel on ""All That"" otherwise, and of course he starred alongside Kenan in the show, ""Kenan & Kel"". The only time, except for this movie where they're in a ""Good Burger"" sketch together, is when they reenact it in a reunion back in 2015 on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon"". Both ""All That"" and ""Kenan & Kel"" are fantastic shows, and when you mix them both together into a movie, it's such a perfect blend! This movie has a perfect story, perfect acting, great sets/locations, and a great soundtrack. The only real drawback in this movie is the special effects. For the most part, they are well-done. But, there are a few that have not aged well. The ironic thing is, some of the bad special effects make it all the more hilarious! Now, let's get into the positives for this film. The storyline is, a competitive burger restaurant called the Mondo Burger is opening next door to the Good Burger restaurant which naturally stirs up some inevitable competition between both burger joints. At first glance, that doesn't sound like much and it may be too simple. But, here's the thing, this is a comedy movie and the plot is supposed to be simple. The simpler the storyline, the more funny the jokes, slapstick and humor will be. All of the comedy is on-point, every joke is knocked out of the park and it keeps you entertained and laughing all the way through. Every time I see it, I laugh just as hard, if not harder each time. That's the sign of a perfect comedy film! As far as the acting goes, it's superb from all of the actors and actresses. First of all, you have the brilliant duo of Kel Mitchell and Kenan Thompson among others. Both of them are great actors and comedians, and their performances here are no different. The rest of the cast do a fantastic job as well! Some of the other cast members in this movie were also included on the show, ""All That"". Notably: Josh Server and Lori Beth Denberg. Even Dan Schneider, the head writer of the ""Good Burger"" script plays a major character in this film! All of the sets/locations are beautiful and give the movie a fantastic atmosphere. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Stewart Copeland is nothing short of fantastic and sets the perfect tone for the story. Props to you, Stewart Copeland. You composed a great film score! ""Good Burger"" is a brilliant comedy movie that just gets better with age. It actually almost made my top ten list of my all-time favorite comedy films! At the very least, it deserves an honorable mention regarding that list, because I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. The cool thing is, that it took a simple sketch and then turned it into a 90 minute movie! It just goes to show that some of the best film ideas originate from even the simplest of concepts. That's hard to get right, but ""Good Burger"" nailed it! I give it 4 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 8 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Good Burger"", and you love ""All That"" and ""Kenan & Kel"", go watch this one. I guarantee that you'll laugh like you've never laughed before. ""Good Burger"" is a perfect medium-rare grilled film with everything on it that's definitely worth experiencing. It's certainly a good burger!",/review/rw5421517/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2006,Special-K88,," works for the right audience
","Likable but puerile and ingenuous comedy about the day-to-day goings-on at the titular fast food restaurant. The focus of the story is the friendship between Ed, a wildly eccentric counter guy who loves his job to the extreme, and Dexter, a new employee just looking to make some cash, and their zany antics to try and save their restaurant after it's jeopardized by the arrival of a bigger, better fast food chain across the street. Obviously adults would have to ask themselves why this protracted comedy is really worth watching, but clearly the target audience of undiscriminating youngsters won't mind so much. Pleasant enough for children, but too cheesy for all other ages. **",/review/rw5421517/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2010,DiamondGirlfl,7," Slightly Silly....Lots Of Fun....For All Ages
","Once upon a time...NICK actually offered fun programing. Stuff your kids and you could watch together and enjoy. Now...most of what NICK dumps out is the same stuff repeated over and over. NICK..like Disney has become a product generating machine...taking kids,pre-teens, and teens and turning them into ""stars"" as quickly as possible...because that generates lots and lots of money. Little concern is given to the actual creativity that might happen as well. My kids...now all grown adults...used to watch many of the shows NICK offered...like ""All That"" and then ""Kenan and Kel""....which is where this movie was generated from. Kel...the rather slow-witted half of the duo works at ""Good Burger""...(how he got the job in the first place does come to mind..) and Kenan...the smart mouth wise guy...who tries to get through life without doing much at all...star in this funny film. As ""Ed"" and ""Dexter""..they get into all kinds of crazy situations...all the while trying to make it through the summer. Adding to the storyline is the fact that across the street from ""Good Burger"" is a huge fast food place called ""Mondp Burger""..and it has none of the charm of Good Burger...in fact...the plan of the very psycho manager of the place is to put Good Burger out of business...for good...or as he puts it...in the grinder. All the workers there are actually afraid of this guy..Kurt...why I have no idea. He looks about as fearful as a cotton ball. It looks like Mondo is going to take over the burger world...but wait...by accident....Dexter discovers that Ed has created his own special sauce....and suddenly...Good Burger is the most popular place in town to eat...and everyone is happy...for a while. In between....there is a teacher who seems to have it in for Dexter..who owns him money for a car accident he caused. Sinbad plays this character...and he looks like he is stuck in the 70s. He seems too mean for a teacher...but adults are never shown in a good light in movies like this one. Anyway...the show goes on and Dexter and Ed go through all kinds of chaos becoming good friends in the process. They also have to become heroes of sorts as well...unlikely ones for sure. They end up saving the day...and all is well. My kids watched this film years ago..and now younger ones in our family have watched it too...laughing and enjoying it just as much. This movie and these actors were pre-Hannna/Carly/Jonus....and much more fun to watch. While NICK is still cute and kids watch it endlessly..it no longer offers the same fun and creative programing it once did. The ""kids"" of Good Burger have all grown up and moved on...few we will hear about from time to time...but the fun of Good Burger remains for those who loved it then and will always enjoy it now...with or without kids being around.",/review/rw5421517/?ref_=tt_urv
