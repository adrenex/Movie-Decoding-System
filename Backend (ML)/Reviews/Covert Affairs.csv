10 December 2010,rogerdarlington,," Not to all tastes - but to mine
","This is not a movie that will appeal to everyone, even fans of George Clooney, who is in almost every scene. His famous smile and immense charm are totally absent in a tight, laconic role as the eponymous assassin-cum-gunsmith Jack/Edward/Mr Butterfly. But I really admired this brave departure from the Hollywood dazzle which has a genuinely different pacing plus look and sound.",/review/rw8188751/?ref_=tt_urv

25 April 2019,J_Batek_II,9," Italy Has Never Looked Better. A Realistic Depiction Of The Life Of An Assassin.
","This movie has been unfairly judged by IMDB members. People are jealous of George Clooney, and the life he has created for himself. Full disclosure - this is one of my favorite movies. I love the minimal dialogue - it creates a certain tone and realism. I love the soundtrack - impossible to find, but worth the search. I love the cinematography - you can watch this film in HD on mute and it is still enjoyable. And, then there is Violante Placido - one of the sexiest women ever captured on film.",/review/rw8188751/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2019,cardsrock,7," More character study than thriller
","This is not the massive action thrill ride you might expect. Instead, it is a slow, character-driven look at an aging assassin. Clooney is good, but it is questionable to have him play a stone-faced killer when the actor is at his best when he utilizes his compelling charm. The best part of the movie is the beautiful cinematography, which highlights the stunning Italian countryside. It adds to the whole Euro indie fell that the film has. The American is pretty slow at times, but the shift in tone is somewhat refreshing.",/review/rw8188751/?ref_=tt_urv

15 September 2010,Ric-7,8," A victim of bad marketing
","As an action thriller, I'd give this film maybe a 2/10. But that is not what it was intended to be. The ads and marketing of the film falsely suggest this is an action film, and that is a great disservice both to the film and to the audience. I suspect that the film's rating would be higher had the marketing been honest. It is almost the opposite of action: it's a quiet, introspective film. I didn't expect a thriller and so I wasn't disappointed.",/review/rw8188751/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2010,TheUnknown837-1,9," the second-best movie of 2010
","Before anybody reading this review goes to see ""The American,"" let me give you some sincere advice. If you are expecting this to be another Jason Bourne or James Bond-style of movie with elaborate action sequences, tight pacing, and ear-throbbing music...you had better stay away, for you will be sorely disappointed. The advertising campaign and production photographs gives one the impression that George Clooney is taking on a role in a movie like Liam Neeson did in that marvelously powerful thriller ""Taken"" released in 2008. But that is not the case. ""The American"" is shot on a foreign location, features a lot of foreign dialect, and was made by a Dutch director with a mostly Italian cast. In other words, it's not really an American action production. It's an Italian melodrama and a really fascinating one at that.",/review/rw8188751/?ref_=tt_urv

7 March 2011,Red-125,7," Clooney does very well portraying a loner
","The American (2010), directed by Anton Corbijn, is a vehicle for the talents of George Clooney. Clooney is too tough, too handsome, and too much the strong, silent type to do well as a gentle, caring human being. Accordingly, director Corbijn has typecast him as a professional assassin.",/review/rw8188751/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2010,elroy_geronimo,9," Time will value this gem
","The cinematography is breath taking, but with top photographer Anton Corbijn at the helm, you wouldn't expect anything less. There's very little dialogue in this film, about 500 lines in total, which emphasizes the acting and the visual spectacle. Don't expect any CGI or amazing action scenes. It's just not that kind of film. It's a homage to C'era una volta il West by Sergio Leone, to The Day of the Jackal (the original!) by Fred Zinnemann and writer Frederick Forsyth, to Italy and in a way to Clooney. The deliberate slow pace will put a lot of people off. The movie is about professionalism, betrayal, loneliness, revenge and love. How good ""bad"" people can be. A wonderful film, that will not be valued by the average Hollywood loving movie goers, but a must see for people who love movies and for whom movie-making is an art.",/review/rw8188751/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2010,Quinoa1984,10," a real slow-burner that is more about internal conflict than action - and George Clooney of course
","The first thing some people (though not all) coming out of The American may say is ""It's... slow."" They may be missing the idea behind the film. It's not about making an action-packed thriller (one critic putting the cheesy pun ""Less Jason Bourne and more Jason Boring"" is foolish to make that comparison), and if you need that this particular weekend of Labor Day then Robert Rodriguez's Machete should suffice with that. This is a film with a European sensibility- it even has the director Anton Corbijn from the Netherlands- and is more about the internal conflict and his mechanical, cold nature than anything to do with a straightforward plot. The American is never confusing, and only for those who are looking for something with a huge shot of adrenaline (which, to be fair, the trailer doesn't do a good job of setting up) will feel let down or bored. It's a work that asks to adjust your expectations for a dramatic thriller. To give a much more apt comparison, it's like Jean-Pierre Melville taking a crack at Jarmusch's the Limits of Control. Yeah, that's more like it.",/review/rw8188751/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2011,claudio_carvalho,7," Engaging Low-Paced Thriller
","In Dalarna, Sweden, the lonely hit man and craftsman Jack (George Clooney) has a tragic encounter with two assassins hired to kill him and survives an ambush. Jack travels to Rome and calls his contact Pavel (Johan Leysen) that meets him in a cafeteria, gives a Fiat Tempra to him and asks Jack to travel to the countryside for a next assignment. Sooner a woman called Mathilde (Thekla Reuten) meets Jack and delivers the specification of a sophisticated weapon to be constructed by him. While living in the village and building the weapon, Jack befriends the local priest and has sex with the prostitute Clara (Violante Placido). The distrustful Jack gets closer to Clara and sooner they date outside the brothel. When Jack tells Pavel that this work will be his last one and he will retired after delivering the weapon, Jack is betrayed and he does not know who can be trusted. ",/review/rw8188751/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2011,perkypops,8," The loneliness of an assassin brilliantly recreated
","When a film is made with an atmosphere that doesn't suit or fit it, it loses much of its meaning, its sense of story telling. The American brilliantly portrays a time in the life of Jack, for whom killing is a job and a means of survival, his survival. We witness his isolation, coldness, emptiness, his senses honed out of pure fear, a man who may not, in the words of his boss, ""make friends"". We are also warned very early in the film that Jack may be losing his edge. Is Jack really softening up?",/review/rw8188751/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2019,TheMovieDiorama,6," The American substitutes outlandish action for a vacuous yet restrained dramatic thriller.
","It was only a matter of time before I watched this. A film hated by audiences for its misrepresenting marketing and rarely discussed amongst cinephiles due to its style over substance. The plot is vacuous no question, and struggles to fill up its runtime. However, as a character study, I believe Corbijn's minimalistic approach to be incredibly nuanced and tasteful. A contract killer on the run is temporarily residing in the Italian countryside where he has one final task to pull off for a client, to which he meets a woman he is romantically interested in.",/review/rw8188751/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2010,Movie_Muse_Reviews,7," A quiet and moody character-driven thriller with impressive visuals
","Most ""one last job"" movies are high-energy action flicks or thrillers driven by a veteran actor playing a character with a troubling back story, but Anton Corbijn's ""The American"" operates as a character-driven mood piece, a precise and quiet visual portrayal of a man trying to quit his dangerous profession who is constantly haunted and pervasively paranoid.

","I suspect George Clooney agreed to star in The American as it gave him the opportunity to spend time in his beloved Italy.

12 November 2011,tieman64,," Intolerable Cruelty
","Your standard George Clooney character is a smooth, sexy, professional bachelor. He typically has no familial or romantic attachments, is committed to non-commitment, has zero paternal instincts, marital cold feet, and whatever yearnings he has to ""be with someone"" continuously clash with his need to be professionally distant. ""Up In the Air"", ""The American"", ""Intolerable Cruelty"", ""Out of Sight"", ""Batman and Robin"", ""Burn After Reading"" etc all see Clooney playing the same character, which itself echoes his famous off-screen bachelorhood.",/review/rw8188751/?ref_=tt_urv

","You can almost see Belmondo playing this role. And it is a credit to Clooney that you do not. And thinking about it, it is hard to imagine any other actor (right now) who could portray this role as he did. At least from the ones that we came to know over the years.

Oh, he also falls in love with a prostitute (Violante Placido); it's all very heart warming and interesting.",/review/rw8188751/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2010,nysalesman100-1,1," Here we go again
","Here we go again, another group of self proclaimed ""intellectuals"" see a movie they don't understand and call it Brilliant! Give me a break; this is without a doubt one of the most ""BORING"" movies of all time. Just as a reality check, I'll explain the movie. Clooney failed miserably at trying to make a artsy European thriller. While all the acting was good, most of the movie drags on horribly, and is full of holes. The only good part was the first 5-minutes and if Clooney was shot in that sequence, ending the movie, then I would have left the theater more satisfied. As far as the plot, well lets start with Clooney making a weapon with ""the capacity of a sub-machine gun but the range of a rifle"" - it's called an M14 and has been around since the 1960s. In fact when Clooney finished building the gun I turned to my wife (who fell asleep a few times during the movie) and said ""congratulations you just built and M14 with a retractable stock."" Later in the movie he admits to the shooter that the gun is a modified M14. So why would a covert operation need a gunsmith to build a specialized gun in a remote part of Italy when the gun can be purchased off the rack and modified with a retractable stock in someone's basement? Or better yet, instead of modifying a classic M14 (with the wooden forearm) just purchase a modern day KART M14 EBR Airsoft Sniper Rifle, which has the retractable stock as standard equipment. You would think these ""covert professionals"" would know this, and the studio would have done their research to make the plot as realistic as possible. Then having to fit the M14 in a large Samsonite briefcase so the female shooter can carry it without raising suspicion. When was the last time you saw a female executive carry a large, black,Samsonite briefcase? I don't know about anyone else, but having some background in surveillance this would have made the shooter stick out like a sore thumb. If I spec'd this operation (assuming it wasn't a long distance shoot, which is wasn't when she tried to shoot Clooney) I would have gone with a Heckler & Koch MP5 with the optional scope, which could have easily fit into a woman's portfolio case. Let's not forget the CGI butterflies,which made me think I was watching Avatar for a brief moment. Of course I'm just picking at technicalities, which have nothing to do with why this movie failed so miserably at providing entertainment value. Lately the movie studios have been cracking down on people that download movies. Maybe people wouldn't be downloading these movies if they got their money's worth when they pay $28 to see garbage like the American.",/review/rw8188751/?ref_=tt_urv
