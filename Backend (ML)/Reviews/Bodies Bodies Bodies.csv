21 August 2022,Calicodreamin,4," Scream for Gen Z
","A modern horror of sorts, no scares and mild action. Mostly focused on trying to study the breakdown of people in the wake of suspicion. As I was looking for some good scares, I left feeling disappointed. I should have kept my old ass at home.",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2022,cadillac20,5," A Lot Less Clever Than It Thinks It Is
","Part of me wants to rate this well for how good it is at touching on a lot of what Gen Z is today. A lot of me wants to give this a thumbs down for how completely unlikable the characters are, how overplayed the point is, and how predictable and dumb the whole movie ends up being.",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2022,petarilic32,7," Fun treat - don't take it too seriously
","I keep seeing negative reviews for this film and don't understand why? A lot of people used the word ""boring"" while it literally can't be used to describe it. Simple? Sure. Dumb? Yes. Boring? Hell no.",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2022,kjproulx,7," An Average Thriller/Comedy with an Above Average Twist
","When A24 released the first trailer for one of their newest films, Bodies Bodies Bodies, I wasn't sure what to make of it. It felt almost like Scream, but with a modern spin, and while I can say it's not that, this is an enjoyable film if you know what you're in for. It won't be for everyone though, as this film is loaded with subject matter that will turn certain viewers off. All I will say is that it's worth watching, even if you're not enjoying yourself and I'll explain why. You don't have to rush out and see Bodies Bodies Bodies, but here's why it's worth a watch.",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,nscoby93,1," Bodies Bodies Bodies, is Boring Boring Boring
","When I saw the trailers for this film I thought it would be trash and that's exactly what I was given. The only reason I watched this film was because of the positive ratings it's currently receiving on IMDb and Letterboxd, so I thought maybe I'm wrong and being an A24 fan I wanted to be. But dear God was this film so unbelievably boring, the worst A24 film I've ever seen.",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,loganschainker,6," Mixed Feelings
","There are a lot things that I really like about Bodies Bodies Bodies. How it makes fun of Gen Z. Which is why all of the characters are intentionally obnoxious, as well as the great twist. My issues with it being that though the film is short, I started to loose interest. And the humor, which I'll admit I was laughing in any many scenes, there were points where I couldn't tell whether or not if it was trying to be funny. Overall, Bodies Bodies Bodies is a mixed bag.",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,nogodnomasters,7," I don't think he's hiding in my bra
","The production opens with Sophie (Amandla Stenberg) and Bee (Maria Bakalova) passionately kissing. They are on their way to a remote mansion for a Hurricane party. The place belongs to David's (Pete Davidson) father and some of the guests have no respect for his possessions, especially Greg (Lee Pace) for which there is a shared animosity. We quickly discover that most of the guests did not want Sophie to be there, nor did they know she was coming. We later discover Sophie had a real bad cocaine problem and has since gone to rehab, although cocaine and alcohol pour freely.",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2022,Dodge-Zombie,1," If you're over 17 you should probably skip it.
","So this movie (and calling that is being kind) is pegged as a comedy, horror, thriller. The first thing to say is that it's not funny at all. Any attempts at humour just come across as passive aggressive nonesense. People use the word satire which lets face it generally means it's only funny to a very specific group of people and annoying to anyone else.",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2022,FeastMode,6," Mostly enjoyable
","This is a fairly enjoyable and mildly funny movie with some good satirical elements. I had a good time for the most part, except when the extensive arguments started to annoy me. Solid for a one-time viewing. (1 viewing, SuperScreen 8/17/2022)",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2022,ashfordofficial,1," Bad
","1. I just wasted my 94 minutes to watch this dross that gave me no satisfaction or enjoyability. The whole script + dialogues is a Twitter thread written by an attention seeking Gen-Z with so much teenage angst. An uncomfortable, annoying and extremely boring movie that somehow got a 85% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. One of the worst casting decisions produced extremely cheesy and cringey performances and I didn't liked the tedious direction at all.",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2022,goshamorrell,1," The Worst A24 film
","This open-handedness is truly a bold gamble here, as Sarah DeLappe's screenplay (from a story by Kristen Roupenian, the author of the wildly popular New Yorker short story, Cat Person), doesn't exactly offer up a likable group of personas. Played by an electric Amandla Sternberg (""The Hate U Give"") and the wonderful ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"" breakout Maria Bakalova respectively, the aforementioned snoggers Sophie and Bee are the first two of the bunch that we get to meet. With little snippets of information here and there, we pick up that they are in a fairly new relationship, on their way to a house party at the mansion of the very rich David (a goofy Pete Davidson), Sophie's best, longtime friend. With the exception of the modest Bee, these are all insufferably rich people, you see. But their money still can't mask the pettiness that runs amok amongst their ranks. Grudges begin to surface as soon as Sophie and Bee walk into the grand mansion to everyone's shock. Why didn't Sophie respond to group chat and confirm her attendance? Who is that Bee she brought along? The murder-mystery-themed Bodies Bodies Bodies sets all the debauchery in motion across the imposing chambers of the estate. Before we know it, the posse loses all power and bloody bodies actually start falling one by one, against the backdrop of a raging storm and Disasterpeace's increasingly alarming score. Every effective slasher-at least good ones like the original ""Scream,"" which lends ""Bodies Bodies Bodies"" generous amounts of its DNA-is a dance between what the camera shows vs. Chooses to conceal. The fun part is, your struggle is thoroughly shared by the entire cast of players, as they try to figure out who the murderer might be throughout a night marked by complex dynamics around gender, age, class, and visceral insecurities. It's quite a ride even when the tempo drops ever so slightly towards the end; the kind of stuff fun summer entertainment should be made of.",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,smoke0,," Great twist, did not see it coming
","This was enjoyable from start to finish, and I don't get the negative reviews, particularly those whining about Gen Z; this isn't just Gen Z, it's any group of rich kids having a party that goes very wrong in any generation, with the same behaviors and reactions any of them would have exhibited in any generation, of course with minor differences. So enough about that.",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2022,jp_91,8," Generation Z horror.
","""Bodies Bodies Bodies"" is a fun horror and black humor movie whose script manages to entertain and make you wonder who the murderer could be. Although some internet pages mistakenly classify it within the slasher subgenre, this movie is really focused on black comedy. The performances are good and the best thing is its soundtrack, which is totally awesome, making a good duet with the image on the screen. A defect is its cinematography which is not bad but could have achieved a better effect if it had been more innovative. A film that, without being a masterpiece, talks about generation Z in a crude way, it is definitely a film worth seeing.",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,johannes2000-1,8," A suspenseful, pleasantly different who-dunnit
","I liked it. Yes, it's a bit talkative, but that didn't really bother me, since the dialogues are pleasantly sharp and added wonderfully to the toxic and ominous atmosphere of mutual suspicion between this group of (supposed) friends. The settings (a luxurious villa, thunder and lightning, lights falling out, etcetera) are of course über-cliché, but somehow it all felt fresh and very convincing, helped by an evident tongue-in-cheek vibe. The story was well written, there is no real gore, but a lot of genuine suspense, and I loved the surprising (and cynical) twist at the very end. The acting in this kind of movies usually doesn't have the highest priority, but here it was actually pretty good.",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,vgamerdc,3," Boring Boring Boring
","Ugh. Let me start by saying I really wanted to like this film. However it is nothing how I assumed it would be-and not in a good way. Bodies Bodies Bodies is not a slasher film or a thriller for that matter. It's a film about rich people being a-holes to one another, too caught up in their own narcissism to actually do any detective work. The first and third body I actually was questioning whether or not they were actually dead. It just didn't make any sense. And turns out I was right. If everyone had stopped complaining about their relationships and treating feelings like facts-which is cleverly acknowledged in the only good sequence in the film-and actually done some detective work... Well, we wouldn't have this film and you would have saved 95 minutes of your life.",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,caroline_chupaa,3," A cast with zero chemistry
","Well this movie was.. dull dull dull. I guess it had a few fun scenes but that's about it. It's like ""Clue meets Scream"" only it does not work, and the whole build up everyone's waiting for just does not happen.",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,masonsaul,8," Great whodunnit satire
","Bodies Bodies Bodies mixes the traits of a whodunnit with some quality satire about the upper classes of society that hooks you in once the power cuts out and keeps you engaged right up until its final statement, that admittedly could've been a little more potent.",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2022,funnycommentor,7," An unexpectedly good, gen z movie
","The plot of the movie was very interesting and it looked like it was gonna be a slasher, murder-mystery movie (for example, ""Scream""). Eventually, the plot of the movie was kinda misleading.. The storyline was very well written, so clever and full of gen z vibes. The characters were very interesting and so well-developed, but not very likeable. The filming location of the movie was only one (a huge mansion) and it was really good. The casting was really good and the acting was amazing. I have to admit, the the whole marketing plan ( trailers, posters) of the movie was so misleading. It wasn't a scary movie, nor creepy. It was more of a black-comedy, including some horror elements. It was a very funny movie and the dialogues between the characters, were very well scripted. In my opinion, the killcount of the movie was low and I expected more bloodier and gorier kills. Sadly, some kills were done off-screen and they weren't very graphic. Overall, it was an enjoyable movie, full of twists and iconic scenes. Last but not least, the ending scene was totally unexpected and the plot twist was totally shocking.",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,akshatmahajan,4," Underwelming
","After reading the summary of the plot, I was excited for the movie but the movie turned out totally opposite. It was sold as a slasher horror but it was just a stupid murder drama. Basically a group of friends meet up and play a game of Bodies Bodies Bodies and one of them gets killed. Then they start to turn on each other trying to figure out who the murder is. The tone of movie is confusing and the climax totally irritates you and you may think I just watched a 1½ hour movie for this.",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv

5 August 2022,mattyice12,7," Not A Slasher!!! Leave Your Expectations At The Door
","I don't know who needs to hear this but just a heads up that BODIES BODIES BODIES is a murder mystery and not a slasher film (think AND THEN THERE WERE NONE through a social satire/gen z lens). If you go in expecting a slasher film you *WILL* be disappointed. Like I don't know why it's being sold as a slasher film. It's just setting up unrealistic expectations for the horror crowd. Basically a group of friends meet up and play a game of Bodies Bodies Bodies (aka ""Mafia"" or ""Werewolf"") and one of them gets killed.

20 November 2022,CANpatbuck3664,5," Not a Complete Miss but Doesn't Offer Much Either
","Not every story needs a hero and it can be refreshing when the characters are a little more ""real"" and grounded. But it's more difficult to write characters that are jerks that you still want to follow. Bodies Bodies Bodies is aware that the entire group of people they've centred the movie around are terrible people. It's not a blunder or something the creative team overlooked, but I'm not sure why they made that choice. Is the entire point that young people suck? That's fine... but other than the fact they're rich and are snorting and smoking everything in sight, they don't go about it in an amusing way. The movie is trying to crack jokes but it fails at that as well. You don't need heroic or even likeable characters but it forces the story to do even more heavy lifting to hold your attention.",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2022,jboothmillard,5," Bodies Bodies Bodies
","I saw the trailer a short time before this film's release, I had my assumptions of what it was going to be like, and I was up for giving it a try. Basically, working-class young woman Bee (Borat Subsequent Moviefilm's Maria Bakalova) from Bulgaria is travelling with her upper-class friend Sophie (Amandla Stenberg) to a ""hurricane party"", a social event held by people in the coastal United States during a hurricane. The party is taking place at a mansion owned by the family of Sophie's childhood friend David (Pete Davidson). David is hosting, and party guests include David's actress girlfriend Emma (Chase Sui Wonders), podcaster Alice (Rachel Sennott), her new much-older boyfriend Greg (Lee Pace), and mysterious Jordan (Myha'la Herrold). There is another guest, Max (Conner O'Malley), who left following a fight with David. Everyone has a conversation by the swimming pool before it starts to get windy and they go inside. After drinking, using drugs, and dancing, the group decides to play ""Bodies Bodies Bodies,"" a murder in the dark-style game. The game consists of a murder chosen randomly, each player is touched one by one by the murderer, until the other players identify them. The partygoers mention that the game often ends following a squabble, and soon enough, it does. It ends with Greg going to bed and David getting into an argument with Emma. As the storm worsens, there is a power cut, and Bee finds David outside with his throat slashed, a blood-stained kukri (a machete-like knife) near his body. The group try to go for help in Sophie's car, but its battery is dead because Bee forgot to close the roof mirror and left its light on. Greg is suspected as David's killer because he has a knife in his bag. They confront Greg, who was asleep in the mansion's gym, with weapons. Greg assumes they are still playing the party game, but he realises they are serious and becomes hostile. After a struggle, Bee kills Greg, in self-defence, using a kettle bell. The group doubt that Greg was the killer and Emma theorises that Max, who confessed having feelings for Emma, came back to kill David. While Sophie, a sober addict, is kissed by Emma and accepts drugs, Alice finds Emma dead at the bottom of the stairs, and there is suspicion she was pushed. The group believe that someone is trying to kill them one by one. Jordan and Alice suspect Bee as she is the only one that they really know nothing about, and there is no record that she graduated from her college. The group cast Bee out into the hurricane. After returning to the car for clothing, Bee manages to sneak back into the mansion through a pet door. Bee confronts the group, revealing that she dropped out of college to take care of her mother, who has borderline personality disorder. A vicious verbal fight ensues between the group. Jordan is revealed to have been the ""killer"" in the Bodies Bodies Bodies game, and the others accuse her of being a real killer. Jordan resents Sophie for her drug addiction and using David to get access to her trust fund, and she claims Sophie cheated on Bee with Jordan. Sophie expresses why she would not date Jordan, that she avoids her friends because their behaviour challenges her sobriety, and that Jordan does not enjoy listening to Alice's podcast. After Alice insults Jordan for her insecurities, and Jordan shoots Alice in the leg. There is a struggle for the gun, and it ends with Alice fatally shot in the throat. Then Sophie and Jordan fight, with Bee stopping it by pushing Jordan over the staircase banister. With her dying breath, Jordan tells Bee to check Sophie's text messages. When morning comes and the storm has passed, Sophie finds Bee hiding and tearfully confesses that she relapsed and witnessed Emma falling down the stairs to her death. However, Bee holds her at gunpoint, demanding to see her texts. Sophie throws her phone away and they struggle, inadvertently picking up David's phone in the process. A video shows David filming himself for TikTok attempting to open a wine bottle using the kukri, he accidentally slashed his own throat, and there was no real murderer after all. As Bee and Sophie realise the night's bloodshed was all for nothing, a confused Max returns to the mansion, and the power comes back on. From the trailer I saw, I assumed it was going to be a Scream style story, with some twenty-something characters all in one house playing a murder-themed game that becomes real and there would actually be a killer. What plays out is a weird And Then There Were None reimagining, a blame game more than a whodunnit, obviously chaos ensues and there is some gruesome violence, I found it just a bit too chatty, I wasn't fully convinced by the way it all ended, and I was hoping it would be funnier, but it's not a bad horror comedy. Worth watching!",/review/rw8464197/?ref_=tt_urv
