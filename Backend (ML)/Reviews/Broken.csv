13 December 2005,rbverhoef,6," An enjoyable mess
","I liked 'Domino' even though the movie felt like a total mess. Describing the plot would be as much help to you as saying there was a beginning and an end, so I might as well just do that. I could tell you that Domino Harvey (Keire Knightley), once a model, has turned into a bounty hunter under the leadership of Ed Mosbey (Mickey Rourke). Also part of their team is Choco (Edgar Ramirez), who looks like a Latino version of Val Kilmer. The movie also involves mafia, stolen money, a man with an arm detached from his body, Ian Ziering and Brian Austin Green from 'Beverly Hills 90210' as themselves, sisters named Lashandra and Lashindra, and a Jerry Springer-sequence that could have been a comedy short on its own.",/review/rw1194065/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2005,TheMovieMark,5," A little editing would've been nice.
","My reaction to Domino is about as mixed as the mixed race flowchart that Mo'Nique presents on The Jerry Springer Show during the movie (I know, that doesn't make much sense unless you've seen the movie). I dare you to not laugh once she starts introducing terms such as Blacktino, Chinegro, and Japanic. I suppose if you suck at the teat of political correctness then you might not get the joke, but otherwise it's one of the funnier scenes in the movie (the running 90210 joke being the funniest). At this point you're probably wondering what in the world Mo'Nique, Jerry Springer, mixed flow charts, and 90210 have to do with a movie about bounty hunters. It's a legit question. All I can say is welcome to the unconventionalism that is Domino.",/review/rw1194065/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2005,fertilecelluloid,2," Still a turd no matter how hard you polish it
","Tony Scott destroys anything that may have been interesting in Richard Kelly's clichéd, patchy, overwrought screenplay. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model who dropped out and became a bounty hunter. This is her story... ""sort of"".",/review/rw1194065/?ref_=tt_urv

21 April 2006,jaywolfenstien,," Wild narrative meets Wicked stylization
","Domino opens up with the title character being interrogated, and through the voice-over narration she informs us, ""This is the part where I tell them to go to hell  that I'm not talking until my lawyer arrives."" And two seconds later she tells the interrogating officer, ""I'll tell you everything."" This sets the tone and rhythm for the rest of the movie, and lets us know the narrative isn't afraid to contradict itself. Soon we jump to the setup of the film's ending, then we jump back to the beginning of Domino's story, and then we jump to an important plot point that won't come into play until twenty minutes later. Literalists and traditionalists, please stop watching the film immediately. So in the spirit of the film, I'll come back to this point in a little bit and probably say something completely different. If you're with me, you'll understand. If not, get lost.",/review/rw1194065/?ref_=tt_urv

","Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley) is a tough bounty hunter being interrogated by FBI criminal psychologist Taryn Mills (Lucy Liu). Domino is trying to recover $10 million of casino boss Drake Bishop (Dabney Coleman)'s money stolen from an armored truck. She lost her beloved actor father as a child and stuck with her gold-digging mother (Jacqueline Bisset). She got tired of her life and joins bail bondsman Claremont Williams III (Delroy Lindo), her tough boss Ed Moseby (Mickey Rourke), Choco (Edgar Ramirez) and their Afghan driver Alf (Riz Abbasi). Claremont runs the armored truck company. Lateesha Rodriguez (Mo'Nique) is one of his mistresses who is his inside girl in the DMV.

16 June 2008,Jonny_Numb,1," Domino, we hardly knew ye...
","Tony Scott has never been a very good director, but every film he's made after ""Crimson Tide"" seems to bring him one step closer to being the inarguable worst working today (Michael Bay may fall into the same category, but at least his big, dumb, delusional epics entertain on some primally perverse level). And like other overblown Hollywood biopics (""De-Lovely"" and ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" for instance) chronicling the lives of pretentious, overrated, or outright shallow ciphers given an aura of ""mystique"" by a society that thrives on the juicy behind-the-scenes details, ""Domino"" is a film that begins with little potential, and dashes that infinitesimal amount before the sixty-minute mark. With an already-distended running time of 128 minutes, the film feels twice as long, and spending time with characters this obnoxiously superficial and forgettable (unlike the superior ""Rules of Attraction,"" Scott's attempts to tinge the proceedings with irony via Domino's smug, self-aware-rich-girl voice-over only draws attention to the film's sledgehammer cluelessness) becomes an act only masochists could find pleasurable. The story? Spoiled-upper-crust-babe Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley, in an ersatz-badass performance as shallow as her gorgeous looks) is sick of the shallow lifestyles of the rich and famous in Los Angeles, and accosts gruff bounty hunters Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez to learn a more exciting trade; along the way, there are double-crosses, shootouts, media attention (courtesy of a tongue-in-cheek Christopher Walken, phoning in his trademark sleazebag), and laughable hints at romance. Scott cuts the film together in segments that rarely last more than a few seconds, cranking up the resolution to make the film a neon-drenched nightmare that's frankly unpleasant to watch--if Scott's given an opportunity to shakily frame an image, ghost it, or distort it in some way, he will; but all this tacky stylistic overload overwhelms what little plot, characterization, and suspense the film has (to say nothing for its, ehm, ""entertainment"" value). Most of the characters come off as either contemptible or stereotypical, oftentimes both (observe the unbearable, several-minute segment where an African-American introduces a new list of racial categorizations on ""Jerry Springer""), and I found myself wishing they would all get the ""tails"" end of our protagonist's coin by the end. ""Domino"" is utter, unmitigated trash--whatever interest in this individual Scott hoped to inspire in his audience, it is lost in a sea of migraine-inducing neon pretension a few minutes in.",/review/rw1194065/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2006,SteveLKay,1," Awful
","From the first moment, this ""thing"" is just an awful sequence of extremely short cuts of blurry camera work. While the overall plot has every potential for a thriller, the story is so badly told that I'm unable to buy it. From the middle of the film, the actions of characters don't make sense to me. Stop reading now to avoid SPOILERS.",/review/rw1194065/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2006,jzappa,8," A Record-Setting Film In Many Ways
","Domino is that special kind of movie that goes for broke. Every scene is filled with the loudest, most boisterous possible film-making, screaming with life. Is it a very good movie per se? No. It is way too self-indulgent and silly. It makes the real-life Domino Harvey look like an almost impossibly improbable bad-ass, showing her in impractical, John Wayne fantasy-oriented scenes wherein she coolly punches or tells off a snobby Beverly Hills brat and other such pride-centered presentations of her. But the amount of license it takes is used to the advantage of just how outlandish a movie can possibly be. The only true events in the film are the early things we learn of Domino being the daughter of deceased actor Lawrence Harvey, who was in the original Manchurian Candidate, and the switch from supermodel to bounty hunter. Aside from that, the movie lets itself go. It's written by Richard Kelly, who wrote the famously weird Donnie Darko, and Steve Barancik, who wrote The Last Seduction, another movie about a woman who lives by her own rules and will go to great lengths to secure that lifestyle. That volatile combination of styles runs amok in this grenade of a script, which has a plot with more strands and subplots than two or three movies altogether. This script doesn't make very much sense more than half the time, but it's got more life than most movies that can actually be considered good. That's because Tony Scott, whose visual style has been rapidly developing into the most advanced form of post-modern VH1/MTV-flavored editing and cinematography for his entire career, and the two screenwriters, who had more fun than a week's worth of orgies writing the overbearingly passionate script, totally went for a record-setting amount of excess with Domino.",/review/rw1194065/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2016,Leofwine_draca,3," Headache-inducing
","DOMINO is a messy film, one of the most overblown I've seen. It rattles along at a fair old pace, screaming and shooting, and director Tony Scott goes out of his way to make every scene, every frame even, as stylish as possible. It's a mess of choppy editing, over the top dialogue and people screaming as they shoot each other while a pumping soundtrack plays over the proceedings.",/review/rw1194065/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2009,johnnyboyz,3," An absolute mess of flash, glitz and muddled romance plus narrative packed into one, overly long chore.
","What of Domino did I hate over everything, and I mean everything, else? Perhaps it was the overall glorification of being a bounty hunter; maybe it was the sexism masquerading as an involving and interesting study of a hard bodied female lead character; maybe it was the mere look of the film with its bizarre yellow glow and distorted blue tints or the manner in which it takes an actress like Lucy Lui; who deserves a lot better than this junk; and has her sit there in the one spot in the room the light cannot directly hit with the same dumb look on her face. Maybe it's the editing; that horrid rapid fire editing and the manner in which lines of dialogue echo as they're uttered by people like Kiera Knightly who, if you buy as a bounty hunter, then you'll probably be able to kid yourself into believing the world will end in 2012.",/review/rw1194065/?ref_=tt_urv

4 April 2006,michaelRokeefe,6," Famous actor's daughter becomes a bounty hunter.
","Tony Scott is director and producer of this rapid paced and frantic dramatic action flick. This is a selective biopic of Domino Harvey(Keira Knightly), the daughter of actor Laurence Harvey. Domino spit out the proverbial silver spoon and after following in her mother's footsteps in the world of modeling, turned her back on the ways of Beverly Hills and became a bounty hunter. Nothing seemed to dampen her rebellious and fiery personality...boarding school, friendships, high school and especially her socialite mother's wishes.

","Tony Scott's adaptation of late bounty hunter Domino Harvey's life, Domino, is a film as LSD experiment.

12 January 2013,Uriah43,7," Dynamite
","This was a pretty good action movie which I believe could have been better if the director (Tony Scott) hadn't kept cutting away to one scene after another. In my opinion this technique didn't help to enhance the film at all. If anything it gave it a choppy feel. Other than that though I thought the acting was really good. I enjoyed seeing Jacqueline Bisset (as ""Sophie Wynn"") who still looks like dynamite. Mickey Rourke (""Ed Moseby""), Edgar Ramirez (""Choco"") and Delroy Lindo (""Claremont Williams"") also performed quite well. Additionally, Keira Knightley (as ""Domino Harvey"") was excellent but it was Christopher Walken who was nothing less than sensational as the television producer named ""Mark Heiss"". He definitely gave this film an extra edge. At any rate, if you're wanting a good movie with plenty of action and humor then this is one you should definitely want to check out. I honestly think you'll like it.",/review/rw1194065/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2006,PersianPlaya408,8," A good film in my book, better than most say
","After watching this film, it was amazing to me how people could hate it so much. I mean it wasn't exactly a masterpiece but i couldn't see why people called it the worst film ever made and stuff like that. The amazing thing was these people who called it these things had pretty similar taste in film to me, but i actually liked Domino. I thought the story was very intriguing, Scott's fancy direction suited it well. The writing was also pretty hip and catchy and kept me interested. I thought the performances were good, Knightley imrpessed me, while Rourke was awesome. I also liked Lindo and Walken in their roles. I thought this was a good, entertaining film. THe direction was at times fast, and could have been edited better, however i liked the soundtrack and cinematography was great at parts. Overall, a decent and enjoyable flick. 8/10",/review/rw1194065/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2006,manuel-pestalozzi,3," For some people life just flickers
","After watching this movie, i felt pretty numb for some time. The longest uninterrupted take in Domino lasts about 3 seconds, and that's LOOONG and necessitates the use of heavy profanity  like they are afraid otherwise people might fall asleep. I just wondered for what kind of an audience this movie is intended. Probably for a very young one who think tattoos are exciting. I also wondered if the viewers are supposed or required to be under the influence of drugs while watching.",/review/rw1194065/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2005,hinata-soul,8," Dirty and Shockingly Exciting
","If you go to this movie expecting something it isn't, you will be disappointed, as with any movie. This movie contains what Hemmingway described as the ""iceberg effect"". On the surface, its simply a cache of random movie clips smashed together to make a movie. If this would be written in a book, it would be a short story, because the action in the movie is very fast paced, and unless you actually try to catch it, the reasoning behind the plot (along with some subtle foreshadowing) can very well pass you by. Definitely a movie you will have to see twice in order to fully appreciate. Experimental Cinematography barely describes this movie. The camera-work and post production add much to the overall flavour of the film, making it quite artistic at some points and open to interpretation at others (something to be desired in American movies as of late). Although, at some parts it may get a little raunchy, gruesome and too heavy for some audiences, the movie never becomes completely unrealistic. The only aspect of the movie that I would write off as ""needs improvement"" is the soundtrack selection. No movie is ever good without a fitting soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is quite fitting, the opening is a little too long, and the other rap songs in the film really could have been replaced with something more appropriate (heavy, grungy rock or psychedelic electronica would have made this film a real trip). The flooding of imagery and dynamic... color palettes adds another ""artistic"" aspect to it, also combined with the events that happen throughout the film, this is not a movie you can miss any part of and still understand. However, that also makes it much more of a desirable film to watch, and not one you'll quickly get bored of. 8.5/10",/review/rw1194065/?ref_=tt_urv
