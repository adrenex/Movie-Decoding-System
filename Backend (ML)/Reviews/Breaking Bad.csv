18 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,9," Excellent!
","Jack Ryan was even better than I was hoping. Now that I just finished season 3 I can say it's just as good as the first two seasons. Like many here have already said the best past of the show is John Krasinski. He is terrific as Jack Ryan. Who knew when he was on The Office that he would be able able to pull off being an action hero? Here he plays Ryan as an up and comer with the CIA. This a smart, believable show that will keep you engaged every episode. If you're looking for a great spy thriller than keep you hooked and wanting to binge as quickly as possible then give this a try. You won't be disappointed!",/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,9," I enjoyed it!
","Jack Ryan is an action packed thriller that will keep you entertained throughout the entire series and wanting more! John Krasinski has become such an amazing actor and is GREAT (as usual) as Jack Ryan! There have been a few actors that have already portrayed Jack Ryan and I have to say Krasinski is earth best so far. He really is such an underrated actor. Most people think of him as Jim from The Office but he's done so much more since then from action, drama, comedy, etc. I also don't get the people who liked Season 1 but not 2, if anything I think Season 2 might be even better, either way both are excellent! I just finished the third season and it's just as good as the previous two. I have really enjoyed the entire series so far and already looking forward to next season.",/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,jhaywood88,9," Worth Binge Watching
","If you are looking for Marvel or DC action, this isn't it. (1 movie split into 8 episodes.) Each episode is nicely woven - the episodes do not leave any gaps (the characters maintain the same attitude, knowledge, position etc.) This season has the right amount of crime, suspense, thriller.. but there was 1 dumb moment in episode 6. He didn't have to run in the tunnel, all they had to do was stop the truck and get into the smaller convoy. Jack wasn't nosey but definitely showed his intellectual and tactical skills.",/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2023,JayWolfgramm,8," What Makes Jack Ryan Different?
","In this day and age, we have no shortage of shows like these. Stuff like ""Reacher"", ""Shooter"", ""Taken"", ""Punisher"" and ""Terminal List"" all roughly scratch the same itch for a grounded gun guy vs government goons TV series. It becomes increasingly difficult to stand out when the series is based on books written roughly 30 years ago. I mean Tom Clancy has been dead for 10 years now. That might explain why so many of his stories involve some spark that will make the Cold War escalate to World War III between America and Russia. Most of Clancy's material has been mined in other films and even video games that anything now seems derivative. Similar to Jane Austen with romantic comedies, so it is with Clancy and political thrillers.",/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,gangeshgnair,8," SEASON 3 REVIEW
","I would have rated season 1 and 2 10 out of 10, this season is also really good, but i feel it did not reach the benchmark of previous two seasons.",/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,david.sampson1,10," Superb stuff
","I absolutely love this show, intelligent complex plotting and scripts rather than just the usual fare of non stop car chases, explosions and gunfights. This is as good as the early seasons of 24 in my opinion whilst being very different in tone as well as structure, plus a much more global narrative, also slightly reminiscent of Bourne in a few places I think. Two hugely likeable and believable leads, quite a few hugely likeable supporting characters/actors, not all of who make it through to where we are now, and some fabulous location work. What's not to like? I will be gutted if season 4 really is the last.",/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,xenoverse-794-229550,8," Season 1 and 3 are 8/10, season 2 is 5/10
","Like many other reviews I find season 1 to be very good, entertaining, engaging and hook you so that you just want to keep watching the next episode. Season 2 lost all that magic and I had a hard time completing it. I finished season 2 feeling that I just had to to see I'd wear other reviews said about season 2 were all true, and they were. I had my doubts with season 3 but I think it got back to its roots. The story is once again engaging and get you hooked from the beginning. If you like season 1 and disappointed by season 2, I strongly recommend you give season 3 a try and I think you will like it.",/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2023,jeewan-1,10," Finished season 3 - WOW
","I recently finished watching the third season of the show Jack Ryan and I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed. While the first two seasons were already great, this latest one truly took things to the next level. Some may argue that the script is cliche, but I would take it any day over the subpar productions being churned out by Hollywood studios. The ability to watch such a high-quality production from the comfort of my own home was incredibly satisfying, and it prompted me to write this review.",/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2019,mikejade-35453,6," Season 2 is disappointing at best
",I was waiting for S2. Jack is on a vendetta to take down the President of Venezuela. Are you kidding me? This is a hodgepodge of stories from the books. I gave it a 3 for the action. Maybe it's writing for a different audience- I read all the early Clancy books and enjoyed clear and present danger book and movie a lot. I got to ep3... maybe it gets better but I doubt it.,/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2023,independently-poor2,9," Proving that TV can be better than film
","""Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan,"" repeatedly, each season, proves the power of the limited-episode TV series (LETVS) over the relatively shorter format of the feature film. With more time to develop plot and character arches, the LETVS gives the story time to unfold more like the novels from which they evolve.",/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2019,hugor,7," Huge decline in season 2.
","Loved season 1, but season 2 took a nose dive in nearly every aspect.",/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2019,neetabora,3," Season 1 was good but season 2 is horrible!
","So, a corrupt, dominating Venezuelan president let's Americans mine their country forest for money but Jack brings the entire presidential palace down because he killed his friend Jimmy. BTW Jimmy was a US delegate, sent by the senator who was himself mining the forest. It would be so simple to make them shut up. No?
US delegate is killed in a foreign country & there's no news, nothing from US side. WTF!
Second, you can ruin the entire palace, kill all guards & create havoc but can't touch the president. Wow!
This season is literally the worst. No plot, no plans just twists.
Please stop making more seasons.",/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2019,chet19,9," Season Two is a boring mess compared to One
","We get it. The cool anti-heroes like to disobey orders. But how many times per episode can this happen without the audience getting bored?
Is it a plot ""twist"" if you see it coming a mile away because it's already happened so often?
""Jack, I order you to take the next plane home and not stay in Venezuela"". Hmmm, I wonder what's gonna happen. Again. And again.
""Jack, whatever you do, don't go to London."" Hmm guess what.
In season One, the bad guys wanted to wipe out the U S with a virus. In Season two, the bad guys wanted to drill for minerals. Wow, such evil folks!!!",/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,romeoluka,8," Impressive
",The direction is very good but it was more the story I like it very interesting. It's an international spy trailer and for me the best was the story in the season 3 who really was impressive because I like the Cold War and this moment was a big inspiration during this season. The acting of the main character is really but is vibe of the show I was suprise lot of suspense and the end of the season 3 is really good with big suspense and a battle between ship. And the 2 other season are also good with a story in many countries like Arabic countries and France. And that's a good point for the show this diversity.,/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,dukebasketball1,10," Outstanding
","This show has been outstanding from the very first episode. First of all, the cast is fantastic. They all bring their best for this show and all do a great job as they bring this story to life. I really don't understand some of these negative reviews. I guess maybe that's because it does start a little slow for some but that's only because they're building the story and the characters up. This is a show where you can't be playing on your phone, cooking dinner or doing something else, it requires your undivided attention. If you do that then you'll have a good time watching this. I was lost in this show the entire time and couldn't wait to see what would happen next. I've loved every second of every episode so far.",/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv

","... the first two seasons were the lead up to the third series... it had been slow and boring much of the time the first couple productions... now the payoff for sticking with it has arrived, in an action-thriller part 3... four years ago had written a review and rated it a ""5"" back then... have deleted that previous review and changed what had been said considerably",/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,tarekali-19909,9," season 3 review - city-hopping espionage, shady assassinations, diabolical alliances
","It's pretty ironic that the Russian geopolitical ambitions outlined in this 3rd season have come to fruition in Ukraine, and are playing out in a most horrendous manner with lasting effects for generations. Nevertheless, it is always the same old motivations, insidious desires to resurrect failed empires and glory, bruised egos assuaged in the blinding flash of nuclear fire, in the shattering flames of war. Indeed as Michael Caine said, some men want to see the world burn. Will we ever be able to rid ourselves of the threat of megalomaniacs who do not understand the terrible price of war? The old guard undertook those horrors and carried the rotting conscience, thus they act as a check and balance against the stupidity of younger fools, but alas these are dying out too, and with it the firewalls.",/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2022,kylebrown0209,8," Good and application
",When I 1st heard that they were gonna adapt Jack Ryan again I was excited because I'm a fan of the books and And then they announced that who Would play Ryan and I was excited because this show is everything you'd expect the books to be it's very faithful faithful and cool and fun and there's a lot of action I absolutely can't wait for the next 2 seasons whenever they come I hope it's soon. Even the supporting cast is good If you are a fan of either the book series or the television we're the television series you will enjoy it Some of the action Sequences Are very cool and I wonder how they did that I never knew what was gonna happen The show was everything was everything I was hoping that the book Was And some of the changes they made actually worked.,/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2019,dpoland-76589,6," Stellar season one. Season two is a complete bust.
","Jack Ryan went through a complete transformation, for the worse. Rated the first season a 9. Now down to a 6. The plot is boring and writing not clever. Predictable the whole way through but I stuck with it hoping for a turn. I was left feeling robbed.",/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv

3 November 2019,JJ99ABC,4," Deus Ex Noomi
","Season 1 was great. It was suspensful, well-acted, briskly paced, and reasonably sophisticated as far as real world politics are concerned. The writers for Season 2 apparently scored a Groupon for lobotomies. I mean everything is just so dumb. Characters do things simply to advance the plot without any explanation or motivation. Noomi Rapace's character just magically materializes whenever the plot needs it. Worst of all, the writers managed to turn Jack Ryan into an uncharismatic idiot. The only reason he manages to solve the conspiracy is because Noomi's character inexplicably does him a favor off screen. Awful, just awful. I give it 4 stars because the footage shot in Colombia looks nice.",/review/rw5235312/?ref_=tt_urv
