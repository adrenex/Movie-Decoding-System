10 May 2021,Coventry,9," You want to live forever? Well, you won't!
","If ""Starship Troopers"" isn't the most epic science-fiction movie ever made, then I don't know what is! What is that you say? ""2001: A Space Odyssey""? ""Star Wars""? Well, perhaps, but they aren't nearly as entertaining as Paul Verhoeven's extravagant, unhinged and excessively violent dystopian saga. This film is probably the most cynical, yet simultaneously the most straight-faced parody in history. Look closely at the FedNet propaganda, the Aryan lead characters and their costumes, the careless sacrificing of the Infantry forces... This futuristic battle set in 2197 is a replay of WWII, but somehow Verhoeven succeeded in making us root for the fascist party! I honestly don't think there is much to write about ""Starship Troopers"", except that it's nearly perfect and brilliant from every possible angle. After the already amazing ""Robocop"" and ""Total Recall"", Verhoeven reached the ultimate in genius Sci-Fi. It's all there: the F/X, the humor, the cast, the bloodshed, the scenery, ... The only things you have to add yourself are beer and popcorn.",/review/rw6649898/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2013,gogoschka-1,," Unique, subversive masterpiece
","This film is about the ignorance of conquerors and the fact that war makes fascists of us all. Now that doesn't sound like a lot of fun, does it. But guess what: it is fun (by the truckload - at least if you have a pitch-black sense of humour and you do realise what this film is and what it wants to achieve).",/review/rw6649898/?ref_=tt_urv

29 September 2013,SnoopyStyle,8," fun shoot em up or compelling neo-fascist satire
","In the future, humanity is under the rule of a worldwide neo-fascist military dictatorship fighting an alien civilization of giant space bugs. Citizenship is gained thru military service. Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien) has low grades which leaves him joining the Mobile Infantry. Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer) is infatuated with him and follows him into MI. Rico is in love with Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) but she chases her dreams of being a spaceship captain. Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris) gets into the highly coveted Military Intelligence.",/review/rw6649898/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2016,Leofwine_draca,10," The ultimate sci-fi war epic
","Being a massive fan of Paul Verhoeven's work, I was very pleased to be able to see this in the local cinema â€“ where the BBFC kindly decided to award it a 15 certificate! The decision was later changed to 18, and its easy to see why. Along with ROBOCOP and TOTAL RECALL, this makes up the Dutch director's gore trilogy : science fiction actioners packed with as much extreme violence and gruesomeness as possible! Verhoeven has a bigger budget around this time, so nominally sets about filming a serious Robert Heinlein '50s sci-fi story. Instead the film turns out to be an epic, action-packed cartoon adventure ride, with cardboard characters and a whole lotta mayhem going on! Verhoeven also has time to satirise those gung-ho American characters but the whole thing is performed with such a love and sense of humour that you can't help but settle back and enjoy the ride.",/review/rw6649898/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2014,rooprect,," ""War makes fascists of us all""
","My title is a quote from director Paul Veerhoven who makes no attempt to water down his political views in ""Starship Troopers"", a merciless, satirical skewering of those superpowers throughout history who believe war solves the world's problems.",/review/rw6649898/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2018,BandSAboutMovies,8," I still can't believe that they sold kids toys of this movie.
","Originally an unrelated script called Bug Hunt at Outpost Nine, this movie licensed the name Starship Troopers from the Robert A. Heinlein novel. That novel is as militaristic and fascistic as it gets. This movie? Well, upon its release, many critics saw it as a celebration of fascism. How anyone came to that conclusion is an absolute moron. This is a movie that rails against it from its very first frame, building on the mega mobile awareness that Verhoeven only hinted at in RoboCop.",/review/rw6649898/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2005,BrandtSponseller,10," The negative buzz kept me from watching this film for awhile, but I'm glad I've seen it now!
","Based on the famous Robert A. Heinlein novel, Starship Troopers is set in a world of the future where militarism is the norm, largely because we've discovered alien civilizations of huge insect-like creatures and we're at war with them. The film follows a quartet of high school friends as they make their varied ways through the military.",/review/rw6649898/?ref_=tt_urv

29 May 2004,Boba_Fett1138,10," Paul Verhoeven is a genius!
","Only a man like Paul Verhoeven can make of a movie with such a stupid and unbelievable story such a masterpiece that ""Starship Troopers"" is. Along with ""Mars Attacks!"" this is the most misunderstood masterpiece.",/review/rw6649898/?ref_=tt_urv

23 July 2003,DeadpoolX,10," Best satire since Dr. Strangelove
","Starship Troopers is a subtle and insidiously subversive movie that proved frighteningly prescient in the wake of post-9/11 uberpatriotism.  Both Heinlein's book and Verhoeven's film are valid and interesting political statements at opposite ends of the spectrum.  Heinlein's novel was criticized as fascist at the time of its publication, and for all his obvious talent as a writer I'm inclined to agree.  The movie is as much a sendup of the original novel as it is a satire of jingoist American politics.  It really is a shame that despite the squeaky-clean heroes plucked straight from the soaps, the Mormon extremists, the multiple-amputee mobile infantry retirees and the propaganda shorts masquerading as news, the vast majority still seems to regard Starship Troopers as a stupid action movie and, for some reason, absolutely refuse to consider that it might be something more.",/review/rw6649898/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2007,lee_eisenberg,7," parodying the '50s to the extreme
","When ""Starship Troopers"" came out, one of my friends told me that it bore little relation to the novel on which it was based: the novel had a plot, the movie was an excuse to show naked women. But one of my mom's friends said that although the movie did lapse into a video game, it had sort of an interesting story. When we finally saw the movie a few months later, we found it fairly interesting. You see, more than simply a silly action/sci-fi flick (but make no mistake about it, those two are certainly a factor), the movie pokes fun at 1950s sci-fi flicks, what with all the ""Know your enemy! Do your part!"" stuff. I'm actually not surprised that Paul Verhoeven made a good movie with this one, given how well he did with ""Soldier of Orange"" and ""Robocop"".",/review/rw6649898/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2009,BA_Harrison,9," Would you like to know more?
","Although Ed Neumeier's script relies a little too much on contrivance and coincidence to be wholly satisfying, Starship Troopers still manages to be a thoroughly enjoyable piece of comic-book escapism, whilst at the same time successfully satirising fascism and the futility of war, once again proving that no-one does ballsy, big-budget sci-fi with subversive undertones quite like director Paul Verhoeven.",/review/rw6649898/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2021,mcleanman-01635,9," Great movie!!

5 August 2020,fmarkland32,10," Bug Killers
","Johnny Rico (Van Dien) decides to become a citizen and join the Infantry after his high school sweetheart Carmen (Richards) decides to go career as a pilot, of course war with insects breaks out and all of a sudden Johnny rises through the ranks and realizes why he fights in this absolute 90s classic. Starship Troopers is one of those movies that can be enjoyed on a simple action level, but also enjoyed as being sort of disturbing, while the film is in fact a treat for the senses, it's honestly the subtlety that makes Starship Troopers so great. For instance, there is no question our protagonist joins for the wrong reasons. Mainly so his girlfriend doesn't leave him as well as her being a citizen and him being a civilian, but as the battle wages on even when reunited with his high school sweetheart it becomes clear Rico has left her behind and fallen in love with his new job. In fact Rico's new squeeze Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer), best friend Ace (Jake Busy) and mentor Jean Rasczak (Ironside) by far become the only family Rico cares about. It is in fact the sequence where Carmen disapproves at the idea putting troops in harm's way and Rico's response of indifference is a sharp contrast, in that Carmen still has humanity and Rico doesn't. Of course let us not forget that the fight sequences are breathtaking, it's fun to see Ironside and Brown in mentor roles and Verhoeven is such a talent when it comes to genre movies. Starship Troopers is then pretty much one of my favorite movies that I watch at least once a year. A movie in the same category of rewatchability as Alien, Aliens, The Thing, Predator, Body Snatchers and The Hidden. (I Come In Peace and Pitch Black are honorable mentions, if I'm honest) as the very best in Alien rampage movies, and I consider this one to be one of my all time favorites. That said, avoid all the sequels.",/review/rw6649898/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2021,Mcduff3601,9," I hadn't rewatched this since my younger years fearing it would be too cheesy for older me to watch... I was wrong.
","I am blown away by how well this movie holds up after all this time. Don't get me wrong this is a solid B movie dressed up to look like a blockbuster. It has got some really cheesy moments but it all works really well. This movie is campy where it needs to be, cheesy and serious all at the same time.",/review/rw6649898/?ref_=tt_urv
