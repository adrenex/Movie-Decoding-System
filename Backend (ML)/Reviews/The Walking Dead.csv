10 March 2018,makka-00955,3," A rehashed idea, done a thousand times and 999 times better!
","A weak storyline, poor script, slow pace and ham acting, make for a less than enjoyable ride. A rehashed idea, done a thousand times and 999 times better! Our lead, Karl Urban, makes Matt Damon seem to have limitless emotional depth. He permanently looks like he is suffering from hard stools - maintaining the same expression throughout. The wardrobe department wasn't too taxed, given he wore the same outfit the whole movie, but for a t-shirt change. Continuity need sacking; cops break our hero's tail light and 20 seconds later it is fully functioning and undamaged again! Make-up is a bit odd, a punch in the nose illicits much blood after a thousandth of a second and one character shot in the final scene bleeds out immediately from the head and body, despite being shot only once. One character dies from a non-lethal wound! The storyline is simple enough. Man accused of something he didn't do goes out to prove otherwise and uncover a thinly-veiled conspiracy. I lost interest so many times, due to the slow pacing and poor script. The movie is lacking in drama and you become disengaged from the plot really easily. In short, it's not good.",/review/rw5804819/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2018,gabriel_sanchez,5," Slow paced revenge-ish movie.
","Bent (2018) is about a former cop that was framed, lost his partner and now is seeking out revenge, while battling his inner demons to just call it quits and stay with his all time love.",/review/rw5804819/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,3," Boring, slow, and bad.
","The 96 min length felt like 3 hours in this overly dragged out slow paced mess. Was there even an editing department involved with this production? The writing/screenplay and directing by Bobby Moresco was atrocious - a high school drama student could have done better. The score was all over the place. The acting was OK for B-grade actors except for Karl Urban, who's performance was a disaster. His monotonic dialogue and wax expressions made it seem like this was his first acting role. It's also pathetic to see all 8 and above reviews only reviewed this film, thus all fakes. Sad to see the producers needing to trick the viewers in seeing this disaster. It's an honest and generous 3/10 from me.",/review/rw5804819/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2018,pambosk,6," Its ok
","I quite liked this movie, just above average. I don't know why so many people had reviewed this film and say that it is a rehash, been done so many times before. Er hello, what film has'nt been done many times before. Even classics like the Big Sleep were done before. Superman....he can fly and can save the world..rehash. Detective or detectives find out who the bad guy is. NCSI. CSI...Sherlock Holmes.
Just because the film did not have a shoot out and car chase every five seconds, does not mean it was a bad film. Or was it because people had to concentrate on the dialogue.
As I said its an ok film.",/review/rw5804819/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2018,ginocox-206-336968,8," A serviceable low-budget noir police story
","""Bent"" is a fairly typical low-budget direct-to-video noir police story with a few satisfying plot twists, adequate production values and a good performance by Andy Garcia in a supporting role. It is not cathartic or cerebral and doesn't offer anything memorable in terms of gunfights, pyrotechnics, stunt work, stage combat or car chases. Even Sofia Vergara's first onscreen shower scene is unfortunately not particularly memorable. The script is weak and needed a couple of rewrites before it would have been ready for production. The opening scene is not sufficiently well crafted to justify or explain the consequences. ",/review/rw5804819/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2018,jb_campo,3," Just a Ball of Confusioin
","Bent starts out with promise but quickly goes downhill and never rebounds. Urban as Detective Gallagher has that cop look and voice, but he's about the best actor in this mess. The best scene is 2 minutes in when his girlfriend, a singer, rips into Ball of Confusion, but then, yep, you get confused. ",/review/rw5804819/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2019,Tak005,6," Let down by support
","This is not a bad little crime story. However, Karl Urbans abilities are not enough to carry the movie on its own. The supporting casts acting skills are mostly not up to scratch and the movie seems to have been clearly made on a low budget.",/review/rw5804819/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2018,thebigrip-1,2," ""Hey there, my names Karl Urban""...
","""Hey there, my names Karl Urban. I'm known for my films where I play Karl Urban and most recently, playing the exciting new role of Karl Urban. This time around, I'm a cop who was framed for murder blah blah blah now out of prison blah blah blah finding out the truth behind blah blah blah bring to justice, etc. It's a real fresh concept on the genre. The script for this movie is genius in that it feels like someone wrote the entire thing in Mandarin and then transposed it to English using Google Translate. Not only that, but Sofia Vergara is in it so we have an excuse for a poorly executed love interest that comes quite literally out of nowhere. She's terrible, but she makes out with a chick so it's worth it. I spend most of the movie hunting down the generic bad guy within 7 days, during which time I conveniently have a ""guy"" for everything to help assist the plot along, without the need for unnecessary things like exposition. Need a licence plate run? I know someone in the DMV. Need to check my car for bugs? Got a guy in a garage. I'm just like John Wick! I also have two sets of clothes for the entire god damn movie, it's really remarkable. Anyway make sure you catch this film before you completely forget it even exists, which is a real possibility.""",/review/rw5804819/?ref_=tt_urv

9 August 2018,lillinfields,6," Two Separate Stories, One Connecting Character
","It wasn't bad and it wasn't fantastic, it fell somewhere in the middle. I'll watch Karl Urban in pretty much anything so I went in with the mindset of a fan. I didn't like how they had two separate stories going on it kinda made the film have a disconnecting feel. However I did like both storylines. I would have liked them as two separate movies...that actually would have been a great idea. I liked Urban's acting hence the 6/10 stars. But for the movie itself I'd say 5.5 or at most a 6 would be acceptable too. I liked Urban's grit. I didn't guess the ending so that was something else that made the movie decent. I'd recommend it if you're a Karl Urban or Andy Garcolia fan otherwise it's just another B rated cop movie with some plot disconnect.",/review/rw5804819/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2018,filiptp,2," Simply bad.
","You thought Sofia Vergara is a bad actress? You should see Karl Urban's performance. It's a primary school's acting level, but less entertaining. Also, the story is a text book cliche, thriller with no thrill at all. I really want to know who invest money in projects like this. And why?",/review/rw5804819/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2018,lynansaysingle,1," Poor Plot
","This movie tried so hard to be good and failed. The storyline is weak. Acting is second-rate. I like Sofia Vergara in Modern Family and she is ok in other movies Ive seen but this role is very bad for her. Trying to get her to get rid of her accent in this role didnt work for her, it took away any talent she had in acting. As for Karl Urban and Andy Garcia, it would look like they havent had better movie offers around. Forgettable.",/review/rw5804819/?ref_=tt_urv

","So, where, for the love of all that is holy, is this movie supposed to be taking place? Apparently it is supposed to be somewhere in the U.S., because otherwise what the hell are all these Americans doing in the movie. Originally Karl Urban's Jeep appears to have Louisiana Plates on it, but in every scene with multiple back ground cars, there are lots of cars that aren't even sold in the U.S.",/review/rw5804819/?ref_=tt_urv

30 May 2018,writeguyr,1," Return of the Marlboro Man
","I have not seen a main male character in a film smoke so much on screen since I watched the 1940's film ""The Big Sleep"" Starring Humphrey Bogart. One might say that this film is Bogart meets the Marlboro Man. It is so obvious that the Tobacco Industry must have helped finance this terrible recycled film, it's like an hour plus long TV commercial for smoking.
The macho character attired in a black leather jacket Danny Gallagher (Karl Urban) is a disgraced cop who upon his release from prison goes on a revenge mission to get the bad guys. All his fellow cops hate Gallagher because he was accused of being a cop killer. So he is now a lone wolf out for revenge. Gallagher is shot at, beaten and comes back for more. Someone should should have told him that if the beatings and bullets don't kill him, his chain smoking surely will! 
The story and plot has been done so many times before, it is the same old same old. But the shocking thing about this film is the shameful outright advertising for cigarette smoking. I had read where famous movie stars were offered thousands of dollars to smoke in their films. Since cigarette ads in magazines had been banned for years, along with TV ads and billboard advertising. The cigarette industry wants desperately to get the public to see smoking in a positive light. So here Gallagher lights up constantly in this film, the macho hero Gallagher is more than happy to oblige. 
I read where the Director of this film wanted to do a modern day film noir with Gallagher as an updated Bogart, with a cigarette so ever in his and and puffing away. Yet, back in the 1940's the public was not aware of the dangers of cigarette smoking, we are today! Funny thing though Gallagher the hero is a smoker and the villains in this film are all non-smokers. Another peculiar item, all the cigarette packs is this film have no label, they are all light blue in color. I suppose the tobacco industry would get a lot of flack if Gallagher had a visible pack of Marlboros or Camels in his hand. 
So this film could be called the return the hero smoker the Marlboro Man, not a cowboy, a cop this time around.",/review/rw5804819/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm assuming the people that gave this movie terrible reviews are the ones only entertained by zombie or superhero movies. I thought Karl Urban did a good job and I liked the story.

","I never write these things, decided to pick this up this flick on Prime because I've usually appreciated what Urban has spent time on (Almost Human comes to mind, not to mention TLOR and Star Trek). I really liked him in The Boys. But this? A disaster. Mostly at the feet of Vergara, in my mind - coming off Modern Family to try to play a dark/sinister/sexy spy?? C'mon - I bet she couldn't go a day on set trying to regurgitate the pitiful script without laughing.",/review/rw5804819/?ref_=tt_urv
