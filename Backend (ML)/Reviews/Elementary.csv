19 September 2018,lightheartedbeing,10," Brilliant! All the way through Season 6
","Just finished the season finale season 6 and have been a faithful viewer throughout. I worried that this could be the series finale, and am very grateful it isn't. Keep watching people! What I find brilliant about this series began at the first season. That a character in modern day as sensitive and intelligent as Sherlock would become an addict makes perfect sense if you think about it. And we meet Watson as the unwelcome sober companion former surgeon hired by Sherlock's father to keep him sober who also has an addiction to solving crimes. The development of relationships and character arcs throughout the years has been a delight to watch. The crimes, the interface with the NYPD with great actors (that didn't have enough to do), Aiden Quinn and Jon Michael Hill, and watching them all affect each other through conflicts, betrayals, along with other great actors playing various supporting roles from the incredible idea of a female Moriarty as nemesis, it all seems almost unworkable until it becomes incredibly workable and fascinating. I find I welcome such an inventive version of the classic. I've enjoyed Jonny Lee Miller's work since ""Eli Stone,"" backtracking his career which got me into British Drama much more. So he is the reason I tuned in to this version, and I love what he's done with the character. His body, the way he holds and moves it, his facial expression, none of which show off his real handsomeness, is amazing. His character is hard to like almost, and the character doesn't care, but does. In this season finale we see a side of Sherlock he hardly ever shows. So much depth and layering of the character that seems like it can keep revealing as he keeps growing. Great writing along with the acting. Lucy Liu who I loved in ""Ally McBeal"" and have also followed is a great foil and partner to this character as Watson. Both these actors can handle comedy and musical comedy straight. but, sadly, there's not much comedy here. There's little excellent television, especially in American tv. Really good shows get cancelled and tripe gets a following. It's mystifying. This is one of the few really great series available to us. I've watched seasons more than twice and it still holds up as great entertainment, provocative, surprising, in depth, great storytelling. It makes you squirm at times, highly uncomfortable as people go dark, even the heroes. What happens to people when the pain of living with what we do under certain circumstances gets acted out. It's great to have a show taking us into these places with characters that look like they may not make it through it, even break, and where and how recovery happens, how they find their way. There's a real dark twist to Sherlock's recovery in Season 6. All the actors carry it all off extremely well. Well envisioned, directed, set, designed, lit, sound tracked, everything about the series is well done. It doesn't miss a beat.",/review/rw6659363/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2015,stuart_davies,10," Well written, scripted, acted, directed, tight, quirky, funny, clever, fantastic...
","Unlike the many Sherlock Holmes snobs who have posted low-scoring reviews, I'm not going to bother with comparisons of other Sherlock Holmes connotations. It's an adaptation that puts intelligent twists to the original story and yet established itself as sufficiently well crafted to stand on its own as one of, if not, the best television series around at the moment. The acting is superb with Jonny Lee Miller, Lucy Liu, Aiden Quinn and Jon Michael Hill carrying the weekly load, with appearances from the likes of Rhys Ivans, Natalie Dormer, Sean Pertwee and even Vinnie Jones to bring some variety. The stories are dramatic, mostly unpredictable with touches of humour and draw on aspects of the modern day as to make them very interesting. I love how they explore the relationships between the characters on both sides of the law and how they deal with their demons both past and present. I find that many episodes explore the fringes of the modern world through topics covering science, computing, art, finance, etc. and this adds to the richness of the plots which, along with the writing, are the strongest aspects of the series. I can't sing the praises of this series enough.",/review/rw6659363/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2013,atlasmb,8," Good characters
","Okay, so this is not an American version of the Doyle classics. But it satisfies my first requirement of a good show--I like the characters. Holmes is a man struggling with his inept social skills while simultaneously reveling in them. Watson is a woman whose job has become a hobby and more. As they adapt, this could lead to more interesting interactions. The police characters are skeptical and protective of their turf, yet open to help. They grudgingly admire Holmes' results.",/review/rw6659363/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2019,southdavid,7," Holmes Under The Hammer
","I'm usually not a fan of the procedural shows that can so often be churned out on the TV networks, but for some reason ""Elementary"" struck the right balance of variety and familiarity to keep me watching for the 7 season run.",/review/rw6659363/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2012,Bobbins1000,10," I'm English, I've read all the Sherlock Holmes books, seen all the movies/TV programs. I like this adaptation.
","I think it's very difficult for people to accept change, in any form. If this is the case for you, and you love the old style Sherlock Holmes...you'll hate this.",/review/rw6659363/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2015,Cheeseandchocolatemonster,8," I could never have predicted this!
","Years ago, I remember reading the publicity for this show before it was released, and pouring scorn on the idea of a modern Sherlock Holmes, set in New York and with a female Watson. ""How pathetic!"", I sneered, ""They must be really desperate for new ideas, to come up with this pile of rubbish!"" And when it showed on British television, I only sat down to watch it so I could pull it to pieces. ",/review/rw6659363/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2012,plex,9," Love it!
","What House was to medicine, Elementary is to investigating. The writing is clever, fast paced and smart. Our eccentric lead ""Holmes"" instead of having a drug dependency for his gimp leg like House, is a recovering drug addict who is being observed by ""Watson"" to keep him clean. They writers really make an effort to spell out the deductive-reasoning details, and for the most part, its plausible, IMO. The plots snake thru twists and turns at a feverish pace and Holmes dedication is relentless. You get the feeling he behaves this way to keep him mind from allowing his addiction to regain control. Lucy Liu , who I love, is curiously restrained in her role to offset Holmes's incessant espousing. Her deductive skills are far less than Holme's but she brings medical expertise to the table. They have a unique but likable chemistry. It seems obvious to me that at some point Liu's character will be developed more and eventually Holmes is going to have some sort of relapse. I can only hope this show maintains this level of intensity without sacrificing credibility, but for now, IMO, its one of mainstream's networks finest.",/review/rw6659363/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2017,Kirpianuscus,," different
","not only for a Holmes in New York. or for a not expected Watson. but for the admirable science of detail. for the chemistry, in not ordinary sense, between lead characters. for the great performance of Jonny Lee Miller and for the wise form of courage to give new senses to the genre. an useful series. as challenge and impeccable script and beautiful performances. for a Holmes who reflects the states of the viewers. for Lucy Liu who is more than friend and translator and right hand of Holmes but keeper of the sense in the cases who are only puzzles for her colleague. provocative. and surprising. for the preserving rhythm. and for the lovely manner to create a credible story of a classic character who seems be not exactly version of Doyle hero. the fresh air - this is the best good point in this case.",/review/rw6659363/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2020,fensser,10," Fabulous times a million.

18 January 2013,fabouluz,10," Intelligent and quirky Thursday night viewing.
","I didn't want to watch this because I adore the BBC Sherlock. However, after denying myself for weeks and weeks I decided to download the first 8 episodes and get to work watching them before I made a full opinion. ",/review/rw6659363/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2016,larry-miller,," Muttering
","The lead actors are serious actors. But Jonny, seems to my aging ears, mutters a lot, buries his words in his head voice, and not all his dialogue is easy to hear. I wonder if that is part of the recording process and I sometimes have that problem with Lucy as well on this program.Then to make it worse, even in early segments, there is unrelated music in the background adding nothing dramatically, but compounding the muttering problem. CBS seems to add this music on other shows as well while other broadcasters do not, to their benefit. Since much of the drama of the show is Jonny Lee/Sherlock's thought process, and that is at the heart of the character's intrigue, this loss of vocal clarity is self-destructive. I wonder what others think.",/review/rw6659363/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2018,susangarner-41150,10," Best detective series on network television
","Clever, well written and directed. Great actors, never dull or boring. Multiracial cast plus Miller's superb diction adds to the sheer joy of watching this series.",/review/rw6659363/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2013,fcarraldo,9," It is getting better
","It is getting better as it progresses. They are moving beyond a simple police procedural. The crimes are getting more interesting. I like it. I don't compare it to the BBC Sherlock. For one thing, the latter isn't tied to the one hour episode with ads format.",/review/rw6659363/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2013,A_Different_Drummer,10," In a Cage Fight with Steven Moffat, this wins!
","Anyone in this day and age who tries to re-imagine Holmes has got to be either crazy or brilliant. (For the record, that was not an opinion. That was a deduction). Holmes has been around the block so many times it is hard to keep track. He is an icon's icon. People even have their favourites -- personally, I like Rathbone, dislike Downey. But enough of the past. Moffat is England's greatest living writer of popular fiction - another deduction, not opinion -- and he particularly likes pretending to be surprised by how popular his work is. (The demand for new episodes of the British Holmes series that he penned was rumoured to be especially upsetting to him.) Although lacking the ""sturm and drang"" of the Moffat version, this audacious little series consistently delivers great plots, great acting and absolutely brilliant dialogue. Miller is astonishing. Credit to Robert Doherty for phenomenal work, and on the wrong side of the ocean, no less.",/review/rw6659363/?ref_=tt_urv

7 December 2013,William_G,9," A different spin on a classic, A great show on its own merits
","Like many people, I love BBC's Sherlock and overlooked Elementary for many reasons. I recently decided to give it a chance and was pleasantly surprised to say the least. First off, don't make the same mistake I did and dismiss it for some of the rather odd sounding changes, it's intended to be a different spin on the classic and does so very well.",/review/rw6659363/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2012,simonv-648-292176,8," Keep it so that only Holmes and his keen logical mind could have solved the crime otherwise its pointless.
","As long time Sherlock fan of books/ Rathbone films and even BBC Sherlock, I was a little skeptical of this NY incarnation. Especially with the gimmick driven female Watson. Having watched the first few episodes however I am pleasantly surprised. The show is carried and carried well by the charisma and scruffy charm of Johnny Lee Miller, who convinces as the eccentric mental powerhouse who has his fair share of weaknesses both socially and physically. Watson does better as a woman than I would have thought and Aidan Quinn is just as brilliant as a police chief in this as he was in the undeservedly canceled Prime Suspect.",/review/rw6659363/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2016,nij-chris-532-818683,8," A rare treat from the USA
","This purports to be a take on Sherlock, migrated to modern New York and it does this very well. Sherlock is a true eccentric, Watson equally and entertainingly odd with the NYPD reassuringly stereotypical, adding balance. Jonny Lee Millar gives consistently outstanding performances full of quirky finger movements, twitches and sudden changes of direction - mental, emotional and physical. Watson is a bewildered soul mesmerised by Holmes, resentful of his offhand treatment of her, intrigued but unable to escape. Irene likewise is outstandingly good - another flawed character, riveting to watch. This series is a revelation, worth watching for JLM's performance alone. Worth 10/10 were it not for Watson's quacky delivery and Holmes' mumbling when thinking out loud but don't let this affect your enjoyment - just see if you agree. Absolutely brilliant.",/review/rw6659363/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2012,bluesman-20,10," Sherlock Holmes Redone for the 21st century.
","Forget about anything you've heard or read about Sherlock Holmes. Forget about A Study in Scarlet the first Holmes -Watson story in which they meet. Forget Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Classic Stories. This is A Sherlock Holmes with a twist. It's 2012 and Sherlock Holmes is a former NYPD Dtective who went overseas to work for Scotland yard. Once there he disgraced himself. We find out he like the Original Holmes was a drug Addict. His Father Brings him home and puts him thru rehab. The father cares enough to hire a companion to keep Holmes off the drugs. He hires former Surgeon Dr.Joan Watson. Her past is as mysterious a s Holmes and like Holmes more pieces of the puzzle come out each week in new episodes. the Shows are well done. Johhny Lee Miller portrays Holmes As I envisioned Holmes in the books and short stories. He's energetic he's restless. He sees things no one else can. And He has a relentless desire to fight Crime. Miller simply is Superb. Lucy Liu is outstanding as Watson. This show isn't for Holmes Purists. Instead of Thinking of Conan Doyle,think of Nicholas Meyer who reinvented Holmes in a series of books Starting with The seven percent Solution. Meyer reinvented Holmes in a series of books that had Holmes Clash with Dracula Sigmund Freud and Jack The Ripper. Elementry carries that same vibe where it feels fresh. And It feels new and that everything is possible. Give it a try you just might end up hooked.",/review/rw6659363/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2015,Narce,5," For Sherlock's Sake, Please Speak Up!
","I'm not going to get into the ""Which Sherlock is best"" argument or discuss the merits or demerits of the show. My problem with this series is that they always seem to talk in whispers. My hearing (just tested) is fine, yet I have problems following the dialog in this show. We normally listen to TV shows with the volume set at 20 or 25, while we have to turn it up to 35 or 40 to hear Elementary - and even then, it's not easy.",/review/rw6659363/?ref_=tt_urv

","This series started out pretty excellent. For at least 2 - 3 seasons we got refreshing material, then something happened that seems to happen to almost every popular tv show, comicbook, or other media product in the last few years. It's almost like we got completely different writers that are just some kind of leftist zombies? It's so weird, but CONSTANT. If there were not so many other reviews on shows like this I would think it was just me and conspiracy theory, but thankfully others seem to see it.",/review/rw6659363/?ref_=tt_urv

","Sherlock Holmes is genius... No one doubts about it. The TV show is good, but maybe too genius.. It is unrealistic, that someone would be so smart and attentive to details.

",Don't expect too much traditional Sherlock Homes except that the main character is British and formerly from Scotland Yard. Otherwise this is just a modern clue based non violent crime solving series. It's lighter than SVU and has a comical vein. It's quite enjoyable to see how the obscure clues come together.
