26 October 2021,scottsideasare,7," It's frustrating
","The show is frustrating because it is so close to excellence. But characters doing dumb things kills it. It pulls you out of the show because you can't help but laugh. Without being a spoiler, imagine two characters have to drive a car somewhere that's far away. They do what they have to do, then one character decides to do the next step alone........so he gets in the car and leaves? So how is the other person supposed to get back??",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2021,rsvp321,," Halfway through S1 and all of S2, you will groan, ""You idiot!"", often in each episode
","If you want to watch a somewhat similar series that has zero frustration for the audience, I suggest The Lost Room (2006) - still holds an 8.2 rate here at IMDb.",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2022,Shadowking1001,5," Final season ruins the series
","Started out with an interesting story line, and so the first season was a good watch. Second season was not too bad as well. But the third season was so infuriating. Writers became so lazy, that instead of writing good scenes, the only way they can get things to happen is to make the characters do the dumbest possible things. Such lame writing really makes you roll your eyes and lose interest in the story. I ended up doing other things or was on my phone most of the second half of S3. Sad demise for a reasonable interesting series. If they do resurrect this for S4, I would likely not be watching.",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2021,kellindil-759-448828,4," teenage dramas and ultimately dumb kids
","Story could be good but it's filled with whole episodes of teen romance, everyone is acting like their iq is 30 and do dumb things all the time which makes whole series ridiculous.",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2022,italoabreuu,6," S03 really is the final nail in the coffin
","If there's one thing I hate in a show is lazy writing, GOD! WHYY? Why would they spoil such a good show with an awful final season like this? So many dumb decisions and unrealistic situations! Seriously, never have I ever hated a character so much like I hate Bode right now. His stupidity really knows no bounds, which makes for an extremely frustrating experience to watch. Sadly. S01- 9, S02- 7, S03- 3 = RIP Locke and Key, the coffin has been closed, hopefully with Bode Locke(d) inside.",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2022,JabezGill,3," Fascinating concept, horrible execution.
",The concept of the Keys is incredibly unique and interesting but that's where the positives really stop about this show.,/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2020,strizbiz-99429,3," Why do writers need to make their characters sooooooo stupid?
","Ok...yeah....let's give the power to find the keys to a kid with zero common sense....who doesn't listen at all...and constantly does stupid things...over and over...and over...and while we're at it, let's make the mother completely clueless and can't remember anything...and let's just make people so stupid things over and over. To me the writers are just lazy and apparently can't make a story work with intelligent characters, it started out ok and got worse and worse, I'm about 5 episodes in and doubt I'll bother watching the entire series. It should be called a series of stupid events. The kid who finds the keys just needs to be dropped off the cliffs so he can't do more damage.",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2022,alexacaleigh,1," this is for SEASON 3 REVIEW!
",I hate this season so much! It's a dissappointment! I hate Bode's character too. Oh pls if you are having a bad day I would not recommend you to watch this season. I am currently watching the season3 episode3 and I swear to stop now. I just warned you all.,/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2020,aan_ke,7," I want more, but better storylines
","I feel this has so much potential, that beautiful house, those magic keys...
but I want to know the story behind it, what about the Locke ancestor, did he know more?
I was drawn to it to bingewatch, but some of the scenes are really boring and ""too easy"" and I felt annoyed about some of the kids' decisions...
I'm kinda hoping for a season 2, but hopefully written by better storywriters.",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2022,AmigaWolf,5," Great concept but very poorly written.
","Have seen the 1st season, and the idea and story would be fantastic, if for not everyone was so unbelievable dumb, absolutely everyone is dumb in this show, they all do stuff only a 5 year old would do, even the adults are dumb, the cops are also really dumb, and the acting in this TV show is also not that great.",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2020,victoragus,5," Interesting idea, plenty of stupid moments
","So, ok, I haven't finished it yet. It's more or less interesting, but it has some moments just heavily stupid, like the writer thought: it's time to lunch, so it must be ok with this stupid solution to the plot. It's a shame.
Episode 7, the one I just saw, was more than enough. Sorry.
What a pity and a waste of time, money and work.",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2020,dwuudz-35775,," Went from watchable to dumpster fire by Episode 7.
","It's gonna seem great until the 7th episode, when you get front row tickets to witness a group of writers throw their own careers into the garbage.",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2022,mr_thewizard,7," Please remove season 3
","Season 1 and 2 were good. Apart from the acting because it wasn't much noticeable. Also, the story was different and I didn't see that kind before, which made it unique so my rating was 8.",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2020,thales-63045,3," Another Netflix flop
",I watched this to the final episode as a previous reviewer said there was a twist at the end. To me it was obvious that something would happen about 10 minutes from the end of the final episode. And so it came to pass. This was typical of the whole series. Nothing really happens until the last 10 minutes of each episode. The twist was more like 'let's make a second series'. Please no!! Anyhoo the characters were dumb. The special effects were the only good part. Each episode of 45 minutes was 35 minutes of teenage angst and I found time to make a cup of tea/coffee/snack/crochet/knit/toilet break and came back and missed nothing. When Netflix have nothing else on their service then watching this tripe still isn't an option.,/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2020,mdbourke-282-899973,4," A missed opportunity from Netflix
","What a shame! This could have been a gothic dark tale with an emphasis on the horror and fantasy, instead it was a poorly acted and woefully scripted mess! The characters were what you would expect from a CW show, not the dark mind of Joe Hill ( who makes a cameo as an ambulance driver)",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2020,natashahillocks,5," The characters are unlikeable, not sure who to root for in this show
","The initial few episodes were developing the mysterious allure of the storyline but as episodes move along ,I find the main characters to be very annoying and unlikeable. It is hard to care about the Locke teens when they make so many mistakes,have horrible attitudes and seem unperturbed by the magical realms they encounter.",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,evans-j34,7," Good first season sloppy second
","I've been eagerly awaiting the second season. The first was great we got to explore brode finding the keys, meet the echo dodge see the keys power ( loved the ghost key in season 1)and whats behind the Omega door and was left on a cliffhanger as poor Ellie was shoved into the magical portal and extra demons escape it was a great first season and ending. Now on the second installment things became overly drawn out!!! Zzzz, it turns out Gabe isn't just a demon now he's actually always been Dodge using the head key which to me didnt make sense as it states in this episode that the head key can't turn her/him into a actual other person just create someone new. But wasnt Gabe already at the hoghschool with everyone before Dodge was released. Nextly how the hell is Ellie suppose to have just appeared from under a rumble of rocks when the dimension door was still locked and had never been opened. I had wanted her rescued but thought it would have to be from the otherside and we'd see more from the other side. Secondly I thought echos can't die by force so not sure what that cliff things all about. And now we have a new echo captain ""whatever his name is"" that was in the well house then hung then in the well house at the end
. Pretty sure if thered been 2 echos in the well house all along theyd both be out season 1, also how annoying was it watching the one they rescued from her own head, lie to everyone that she didn't know what the key chain was for ( which was obvious) so she could face dodge alone STUPIDLY ANNOYING. To much stuff drawn out and uninteresting with too many loose ends this season. The main highlight for me is Brode he actually is the best to watch and now easily the smartest, wish we'd seen more from him. Not a very good second season it was merely a 5/10 so making my score for the show now a 7/10. Im not left very optimistic about a 3rd season as looks like its just gonna be a poor repeat. Hopefully not.",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2021,J0RWAL,3," Strictly for kids under 9
",Another Netflix show for kids. There are none complexities or suspense which adults want to see.,/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2022,reellycynical,3," Season 1 - Good. Seasons 2 and 3 - just BAD.
","The title says it all. Cool story for Season 1 - ok we all get it. Move to Season 2. - basically a repeat of Season 1,... kind of boring.",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2021,mayank09876,7," Mysterious, Supernatural Spooky Teen Drama, Great Plot, Uneven Flow.
","I had read the first few volumes of the comics the series is based on about a decade back, I remember loving it. Having forgotten pretty much most of the contents, it felt right to jump into the TV series, got to say I was not disappointed, but still below my expectation.",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2020,kirbie2182,7," Good but I wish it wasn't such a PG 13 vibe
","I really enjoyed watching it, and honestly the views of Nova Scotia where enough to keep me intrigued, but it's clear that they deviated from the comics darker side to gain a more Inclusive audience for family viewing. I liked it, but I just wish it would have been more geared towards grown-ups who enjoy the blood & gore from the comic books. I guess I just wanted it to be scarier, darker, more moody. I understand why they did what they did, but because they chose to go the PG Route, it ends up playIng out as a CW type drama, which isn't exactly always a negative Thing, in fact I like a couple CW shows, but even Riverdale goes darker than this. I'm hoping season two is scarier. Just don't listen to the people who say it's terrible because it's obviously not, but don't expect to be scared if you're over the age of 13.",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2020,toddcha,6," Wrong focus
","If this series is about magic then 1/10 in one episode is about magic. The rest is either their school life which is exceptionally irrelevant or their boring interactions. Especially the mom, I gotta say even the teens act better than she. Their old story with the weird guy is So typical of Netflix. Well, ask yourself what you will do if tou have these magic items. Then you will know how illogical the series is.",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2020,Rob_Taylor,7," Nice idea, but suffers the usual failings of such works
","By that, I mean having the characters do dumb things to set up plot development. Honestly, if you can't think of better ways to get your story where it needs to go than ""Let's have character X do something stupid"" then probably you should stick to less involved writing tasks.",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2021,kevin_robbins,6," The intensity was lacking, acting and scenarios/decisions were disappointing, and the conclusion was a letdown
","We finished this over the weekend finally. I actually collected these graphic novels years ago. Overall, I loved the concept of the series - the fantasy elements and premise were wonderfully delivered. The settings felt authentic and the magic kept you tied to every episode. I also loved the Tom Savini reference and the Joe Hill cameo. However, the intensity was lacking, acting and scenarios/decisions were disappointing, and the conclusion was a letdown. I'd give it a 6/10.",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2020,kosmasp,7," Imagination
","When I read the comics (graphic novels), I was quite smitten by them. They are adult, they are mean and they are quite something - encouraging the reader to imagine stuff, but also being quite visceral when it comes to violence. While the adaptation is not holding back entirely on the violence, it does shift tone wise and going more .. well soft.",/review/rw5572196/?ref_=tt_urv
