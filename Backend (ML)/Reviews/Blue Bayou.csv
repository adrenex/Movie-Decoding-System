12 January 2015,bkoganbing,8," Entrusted with the memories of the past
","If you think that the world that George Orwell created in 1984 was a rigid one they were positively hedonistic compared to the society shown in The Giver. Playing the title role is Jeff Bridges who is called that because he has a very special duty to be the one entrusted with the memories of the past. The ruling body of the society has to be able to refer to the past to be guided in making decisions. But we can't have everyone knowing about lest they long for the good things of the past. It's all been abolished the good and the bad, conformity and sameness is the order of things. Color is not even allowed everyone wears drab clothing like they were in prison. The family is abolished, kids are born and then assigned to nurturers, women particularly go into that occupation and it is an occupation like being a plumber. ",/review/rw3068944/?ref_=tt_urv

","""The Giver"" from the movies is certainly different from the original text, yet one can't be disappointed because it remains faithful to many of its elements. Looking at the incredible work done by the designers, one has to admit that this is a fairly accurate representation of what a sterile, safe, and totalitarian society probably would like in the future. The general population follows the rules automatically, with minor exceptions, and the illustrious leaders make sure their presence is respected and understood.

","""I know there is something more, something that has been stolen."" It is choosing day and Jonas (Thwaites) is told that he is to be a receiver of memories. He meets The Giver (Bridges) and is amazed at what he shows him. Jones learns quickly that the Utopia that everyone lives in is not as perfect as it seems. After experiencing color and emotions Jonas wants to show everyone what he knows. The Elders are not happy with what is going on and they do all they can to stop Jonas, but he will stop at nothing to make everyone remember. I had no idea what to expect from this movie at all. I never read the book and only caught glimpses of trailers. I expected another teenager-y save the world movie so I sat down with pretty low expectations. I have to say that I was very surprised at how much I liked this. The easiest way to describe this is a combination of Divergent and Pleasantville. When you watch you will see exactly what I mean (as long as you have seen both of those movies). This is a great family movie and my entire family loved it. It is rated PG- 13 and I think it is because of one small part but you will not have to have your hand on the pause or fast forward button if you are watching this with your family. Overall, this is just a good movie that the whole family will enjoy. I give this a B+.",/review/rw3068944/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2014,billygoat1071,4," Fitting In
","The most obvious and cynical theory to come up with the existence of The Giver movie is the success of futuristic YA movies such as The Hunger Games and Divergent. Though, The Giver was never meant to be a YA book in the first place, and it's already a two decades old book that has been going through some controversies in the past. This movie is proof that Hollywood is just picking books randomly and turn them into movies to match the trend. The important question is does it stay true to what makes the story so great? Apparently not. Not because it's now starred with teenagers instead of twelve year olds, or it consists more action scenes. The film just hardly cares about the concept and gives more way to the corny clichés of the genre. The Giver does have a taste for a blockbuster, but the heart of the story is missing and that is definitely frustrating.",/review/rw3068944/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have not read the book and certainly will not after seeing the movie. Basically it felt like a mash up of several recent films, combining the futuristic and oppressive world where people are not allowed to feel, the rules that are ""for the good of the people"" and where people are being assigned their roles in life, where everything is iPhone white and boring gray and where there are some young adolescent heroes that are willing to change the world.

","I have seen reviews comparing the Giver (unfavorably) to other teen dystopian movies like Divergent and Hunger Games. That's actually a compliment, the Giver is not more of the same stuff, The critics seemingly can't accept that people are smart enough to get the point of Lois Lowry's book, and that people aren't smart enough to enjoy, much less understand, a character study and a societal study. Mindless action, needless violence, and transforming robots are all absent here. I have a feeling though, that people are smarter than they think. The book has been popular for at least 30 years, why would people balk at the movie adaptation? The Giver is a project that has been in the back of every movie maker's mind for years, now it's here.

","saw 'the giver' last night at the fathom events screening. It was my favorite book growing up when i read it in school and maybe the reason I wasn't horribly disappointed was because it didn't even look great from the previews. nonetheless, i watched the movie. having recently read the book in preparation for the movie, the first thing that stood out to me was how quickly they jumped into the memories. It takes about ten chapters of the book to get there, and the movie gets there in less than ten minutes. it cuts out all the build up of the book and depending on how you like the speed of your films, this could be good or bad. this could pinpoint to why the movie didn't completely work. the script was rushed. it is definitely a case of 'when good actors happen to bad scripts'. because of the nature of the script (or because the nature of the movie, who knows?) the actors aren't given much to work with. this may not be their fault as the whole point of the story is a dystopian society where they don't allow you emotions, but to watch actors have straight faces for 94 minutes isn't exactly a pleasant experience. it leaves you feeling meh about the whole thing as i did. shame.",/review/rw3068944/?ref_=tt_urv

","At its core this is a movie with a very worn out theme of Ubertypical American-ness: Communism vs Capitalism (the latter is often inaccurately labeled as Democracy or Market Freedom). It's about the choice between strong, oppressive(?) community values versus individual choice. Absurdistic forms of 'sameness' have been explored in Kurt Vonneguts Harrison Bergeron, and in every movie with alien beehive societies, which are thinly veiled mockeries of communism. For example, the aliens in Starship Troopers and Battle Star Galactica.",/review/rw3068944/?ref_=tt_urv

30 August 2014,mmweaver13,10," Short movie, but simply amazing! Adds further depth and closure not given in the book.
","Everyone is judging this movie based on its accuracy to the book, which is understandable. I re-read the book 2 days ago, so it would be fresh in my head before viewing the movie for the first time. I absolutely love the book, and I had heard varying opinions about the movie (mostly negative), but I wanted to watch it with an open mind and present my own opinion. I must say: this movie is simply amazing. Firstly, the acting is top-notch: Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges were perfect of course, but Brenton Thwaites and Odeya Rush also brought depth to their characters. I loved seeing Taylor Swift make an appearance in the film, and she gave life to a character who was only mentioned in the book. Katie Holmes and Alexander Skarsgård showed flawless acting in their supporting roles as well. The movie excelled in more than just its acting. There were so many powerful ""chilling"" moments, particularly with the portrayal of the memories. The contrast of the sensory-rich memories of the past with the colorless and boring Utopian community is what brought real depth to the film. My favorite aspect was the slow transition from black-and-white to vivid colors. My only true complaint about the movie is that it was too short. I didn't want it to end. As far as staying true to the book, there were minor changes, such as the ages of the characters and the career assignments, but these made sense. People must understand that when a book is adapted on screen, there are certain things that must change for viewing continuity purposes. I will say that, as always, the characterization was better in the book, and I was able to form a connection with the characters quicker with a written description. The movie jumped right into the plot, which was good for the pacing of the story, but this meant it took longer to really understand the characters. Having already read the book, this was not a problem for me. The overall themes and concepts (such as sameness, colors, emotion, and love), were portrayed ingeniously throughout the movie. As much as I love the amazing use of imagery in the book, being able to actually visualize the transition from a dull community to a vivid, colorful world was breathtaking. Also, without giving spoilers, the movie gives explanations to concepts in the book, especially with the ""memory boundary"" that separates the society from Elsewhere. The movie doesn't stray from the book, it just provides more clarity. Finally, I loved the ending of the movie. It gives more closure, and was even more satisfying than the book was. My overall conclusion is that this movie serves as an excellent counterpart to the book. The detailed characterization of the book and the sensory stimulating scenes in the film complement each other nicely to make one cohesive, stunning, and powerful story.",/review/rw3068944/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2015,anaconda-40658,7," Odeya Gives.
","The Giver (2014): Dir: Phillip Noyce / Cast: Brenton Thwaites, Jeff Bridges, Odeya Rush, Meryl Streep, Katie Holmes: Set in the very distant future blanketed in a black and white atmosphere thus eliminating feeling, emotion, race, and basically, conflict. It is a film about connection and experience. In a curious setup that may remind some viewers of Divergent, everyone is split into particular groupings depending on stature and ability. Jeff Bridges plays the Giver, the key holder of the world's past, memories and emotions. He lives at the edge of this isolated community surrounded by books. Brenton Thwaites plays Jonas, who has been assigned to be the next Giver. The elder Bridges grasps his hands and shows him a past earth full of love, fear, hate, envy, and desire. He discovers what love is and desires to share it with Fiona, a friend since childhood. This causes tension when the chief elder learns that the Giver is training Jonas to travel to the outer limits thus breaking their controlled society. Provocative themes throughout with ideas and visual wonders that may leave viewers wanting more by its lingering conclusion. Director Phillip Noyce presents a lavish of black and white spectacular with occasional colours emerging. Thwaites is decent casting as Jonas. Bridges as the Giver is given background regarding his daughter, a previous pupil. Odeya Rush plays the fresh face Fiona full of life. Meryl Streep is underwhelming deadpan as the chief elder. Katie Holmes is subdued and terrible dialogue as Jonas's mother. While often corny, the film presents a perfect society that is not so perfect when the seemingly balanced is hardly a given.
