",I was just utterly entertained and delighted by this film. Because it was just SO well done.,/review/rw5955349/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2018,Jared_Andrews,8," Best Yet of the ""Computer-Screen"" Movies
","A story told entirely through a character's laptop screen - it's an increasingly popular gimmick that's now been done enough times that it can no longer be called fresh. But, thankfully, this is best execution of the style to date. Aneesh Chaganty dazzles in his directorial debut, displaying a mastery of the medium, crafting a compelling film narrative told entirely through someone's laptop activity.

24 November 2018,Platypuschow,9," Searching: I'm not crying you're crying
","When Searching was initially annouced I was excited, a John Cho straight role and in that unique presentation style? Count me in, this was on paper destined to be something special.",/review/rw5955349/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2018,martimusross,10," The Suspense Built and Built
","It started slowly as the characters were revealed and like Nordic Noir the narrative drive was the meticulous investigation on the internet. For those on social media this was brilliant for those more technologically naive this was a bore. The silence and mouse clicks let to the suspense for me others thought it made the movie slow. The acting was brilliant and you felt his pain and frustration. A really great movie with an unexpected twist, I loved it.",/review/rw5955349/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2018,Red-Barracuda,8," Highly original and compelling thriller
","This is a thriller which can certainly be accurately described as original. It takes a fairly typical suspense story about a recently widowed father whose daughter vanishes one night and presents it in a most unique way. The whole film plays out on the computer screen via programs such as Facetime, iMessage, Gmail, Tumblr, Facebook, etc. In this way, it reflects the reality that so many people now live, given that so many nowadays are literally never off their devices. In this way, the film is completely relevant and taps into a scenario most will be able to clearly identify with. The conceit is also terrific in that it accentuates the mystery element of the story, where we stumble upon clues via the various social media platforms. The very limitations of the set-up ultimately amplify the material and take it to another level. I found it to be one of the most original, gripping and compelling thrillers I have seen in quite a while. Lead actor John Cho must be credited too with giving a strong central performance as the grieving father, with some good additional work from Debra Messing as the detective assigned to the case. All-in-all, a fantastic bit of work.",/review/rw5955349/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2019,shakercoola,7," A journey into the jungle of digital footprints
","An American mystery thriller. A story about a father trying to find his missing 16-year-old daughter with the help of a police detective. The film is set entirely on computer screens and smartphones devices which provides the medium by which the lead character conducts his investigations online and seemingly live.
The timely premise of the dangers of online behaviour and associated social media reaction - perverted or genuine - to criminal events gives this film a fresh feel. This film is not an entirely new format of storytelling but the race against time story works well and is well paced and succinct and produces good tension throughout.",/review/rw5955349/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2018,Brandon_Walker_Robinson,9," Innovative and groundbreaking for being GOOD at what it does
","The word ""gimmick"" can be thrown around to describe a major element of a film that changes up the ordinary tropes we'd expect from a rather straightforward flick. There is 3D, timeline splicing, animation, found footage, you name it. Some films almost even fall into these places as a genre. When they do, you get the inkling that the people responsible for thinking up the movie likely have these elements in mind at the forefront with the story as an afterthought. Only when that occurs do I call those elements gimmicky. And it's not that a gimmick is a bad thing, but if that is what you rely on to make your story compelling, it will often become a crutch for poor storytelling or one-and-done enjoyment. Sometimes it is done right, in which case the gimmick works... but most of the time it has that negative connotation for good reason.",/review/rw5955349/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2018,ymyuseda,8," Excellent Actor And Actrees In This Film
","Rating 8.3/10
Excellent thriller film directed by Aneesh Chaganty and written by Chaganty & Sev Ohanian. The seriousness of a father trying to find his missing 16-Year-Old daughter with the help of a police eetective. This film will make you wonder what will happen for next plot. Excellent acting performance by John Cho. The moral of the story is do not trust to anyone, if not will be disappointing you. Worth to watch !!",/review/rw5955349/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2018,yajaira2132,10," Edge of Your Seat Thriller
","It's the number of people sitting at the edge of their seat that makes the score a 10/10. It's like riding a rollercoaster whose incline never ceased. Your pulse is pounding and it's well worth the ending, which no one in my group figured out. ",/review/rw5955349/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2018,bob-the-movie-man,10," A phenomenally intriguing social media-focused movie.
","There have been many movies that have featured computing and, more specifically, social media at their heart. Some these have used the device of the view ""from the screen"": 2016's entertaining ""Nerve"" had elements of this, with the majority of the rest of the film being 'augmented reality' over the video. But it was 2014's teen-horror ""Unfriended"" that set a new bar being seen entirely through a computer screen. No surprise then that the producer of that one - Timur Bekmambetov - is also behind ""Searching"". For - although taking a few liberties with news vidoes, that may or may not be showing on Youtube - the whole film is shot through computer screens. ",/review/rw5955349/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2018,stuartwoodley-58722,9," Get ready for twists turns and tears!
","Amazing thriller- twists and turns. Just when you think the ending is too neat- there's another twist and another.
Had me crying in the first 5 minutes and sobbing at the end. 
Original and gripping.
This film is gonna be huge!",/review/rw5955349/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2019,Mike_Devine,6," A case of real-world horror for a social world
","At first glance, 'Searching' could be written off as a cheap fad of a movie - one that uses gimmicks to suck viewers in so they can feel like they're voyeurs peering into another family's misfortune in this age of social media. While this may be true, there are also some elements of the film that don't feel too exploitive.",/review/rw5955349/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2018,jg_1977,8," Compelling story, engaging presentation
","I just got out of seeing Searching, a ""screen life"" movie written and directed by Aneesh Chaganty, and I can't overstate how much I enjoyed it. Why I liked this movie can be summed up quite succinctly with four simple words: compelling story, engaging presentation. Allow me to elaborate.This movie has an incredibly well written story. It starts with a heartfelt sequence of home movies that endears you to all of our main characters in minutes, quite similar to the beginning of Up (2009). It then unfolds a mystery, layer by layer, until you are quite literally on the edge of your seat, in anticipation for the final reveal. At no point along the way does it ever really slow down or get dull. Everything that happens is meaningful and contributes to either the narrative or the tone. A big part of the story working so well has to do with the excellent performance from John Cho. The entire premise of the story hinges upon his performance as he is the emotional core of it all. Without him, this movie might not be nearly as good. In addition to having a tight, well-written screenplay, Searching also is presented in an incredibly fascinating way. Chaganty uses the restrictions of ""screen life"" to his favor by creating inventive and new ways to present information. In doing so, he truly draws the viewer into the perspective of John Cho's character as everything is essentially shown from his point of view. This heightens both the tension as we learn things at the same time he does, as well as makes his character that much more empathetic. 2018 has had a pretty stellar summer in terms of the quality of movies that we've seen, and Searching thankfully doesn't break the trend. It wouldn't surprise me if this becomes the sleeper hit of the summer. It's quite good. Do yourself a favor and go see it!",/review/rw5955349/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2018,planktonrules,9," Fantastic...but not perfect.
","""Searching"" is one of the best films I've seen in a long time...and I'd place it among the best movies of 2018. This being said, it's got a minor problem that kept it from earning a 10...it left some deliberate Easter eggs which betray a few of the movie's twists. I noticed one...my daughter noticed another. But although we DID anticipate some of the film, overall it still delivered many unexpected suprises AND is incredibly entertaining and unique.",/review/rw5955349/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2019,kosmasp,9," Found
","With all the praise this got and really good word of the mouth, you would be excused for being sceptical. I was too at first. But the movie is really good. And it takes advantage of the tech aspect of it all. Now there might be scenes in there that would have profited of ""traditional"" filmmaking, but as it is, it really works out for everyone and everything.",/review/rw5955349/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2018,Reviewer64646,10," Finally a decent tech movie

1 September 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,8," An excellent film, despite the distracting direction.
","I am so glad to see so many positive reviews for this film, and I can see why, as it is an excellent film. How nice is it to see a Chinese/American cast lead a film, very welcome indeed. The story is excellent, I really liked how it unfolded, it's a thriller set very much in modern times, the prime obstacles being social media, and the people who live their lives through it. The action was excellent, and as a lover of twists in movies, I was well served here, plenty, lots of things I didn't see coming, really enjoyed.",/review/rw5955349/?ref_=tt_urv

",I was not planning on watching this but I saw the high rating on imdb and considering how bad most movies with this gimmick are it peaked my interest that people actually like this one.

9 September 2018,Bertaut,7," Rubbish plot, but aesthetically well crafted
","Searching is a film with two main organisational principles; there's the thriller plot, which ostensibly keeps everything moving, and to which everything else should, in theory, be in service. Then there's the aesthetic design, with the entire film taking place online, the images presented taking the form of what is seen on computer screens, iPhones, security cameras etc. One of these principles is exceptionally well handled, the other isn't, and it shouldn't take a genius to guess which is which. If we're being really honest, in fact, the plot becomes more and more incidental as the narrative progresses and ever more ludicrous flights of fancy are introduced, transposing the story from a search for a missing girl into a litany of clichés and melodrama. On the other hand, the main reason, indeed probably the only reason any of us saw the film at all is because of its unique visual schema, and thankfully, this aspect is realised with an impressive degree of craft. You know you're in reasonably secure territory when the filmmakers are self-aware enough to begin an online film depicting the latest in consumer technology with the sound of an old dial-up connection.",/review/rw5955349/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2020,Leofwine_draca,6," A novel thriller
","SEARCHING is an Internet-based thriller with a novel premise: the whle story is told via a computer screen and all of the myriad programs, apps, emails, social media accounts and videos that goes with it. It's not quite original, having already been used for the horror film UNFRIENDED and its sequel UNFRIENDED: DARK WEB, but unlike those two films, this one is actually pretty good. John Cho is fine as the distraught father, putting his Harold & Kumar days long behind him, and the film has a really good pace to keep you watching constantly. There's plenty to say about familial relationships, grief and the facelessness of a modern, Internet-based society, and if it does get increasingly convoluted and mildly ridiculous come the final twist at the climax, it's still a good 'un.",/review/rw5955349/?ref_=tt_urv
