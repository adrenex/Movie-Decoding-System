2 October 2004,film-critic,," He's a victim of circumstance.
","Larry David, king of awkward moments and co-creator of the hit television series Seinfeld, has come back to television at full force. His hit series, Curb Your Enthusiasm, is a further extension of his life. Seinfeld has ended, his co-creator name has earned him about $200 million and growing, and his life is just getting excited. On these thirty minute trips, we follow Larry through moments with his wife Cheryl and manager Jeff. Circumstance continues to happen and Larry somehow always happens to be in the middle.",/review/rw8453688/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2003,glgioia,," Seinfeld Rated R
","So what does Larry David do for an encore after the incredibly successful sitcom that detailed his experiences as a stand up in NY, he creates a new sitcom about his experiences as a very succesful creator of said show, post cancellation, living the good life with a ton of dough out in Malibu. Sounds pretty boring, and even snotty right? Its not at all. Like the rest of us, I loved Seinfeld, and still love the reruns. But I gotta say, this show is better. It's the same basic premise, which I guess is to turn a standup monologue into a situation comedy. In other words, instead of having a guy on stage telling jokes about the amusing and annoying happenstances of every day life, you create a format comedy, and use these anecdotes to weave together a plot. What made Seinfeld memorable was the clever way in which everything all in the end tied up in a nice little package. If you notice, that's a common laugh getter for stand-ups, to inject a joke they made earlier in their set and put it into practical anecdotal demonstration. You are right if you are thinking this is complete hogwash and hyper-analyzation of something not meant to be studied as such, but there it is. Having said all of that, I think CYE is the logical next step for fans of the Seinfeld show. It's the advanced course if you will of the more remedial network show. The freedom of HBO allows for obviously more adult material and language, but also for pure artistic expression. A lot of what goes on is definitely not palatable to the mainstream, and I could honestly see people hating it. Not me. I think its a rare chance to see genius, unfettered and uncensored. Yes Larry David was George Costanza or vice versa, but through this series, you also see he was Kramer, Elaine and Jerry. For some reason I totally relate to his inability to relate to everyone else, including his wife. Its often way too contrived, but I love it. If you were a fan of Seinfeld for the reasons I've mentioned, and not just for the run of the mill laugh track jokes, you will be missing something special if you don't give these a shot.",/review/rw8453688/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2002,MovieMarauder,," Some People Just Aren't Getting It...
","I think too many people are looking to this show as a Seinfeld spin-off.  The truth is, it's not, and you have to take the show for what it truly is.  Larry David, in his great comedic brilliance, is not trying to glorify himself with this show, you can tell that just from watching one episode.  Instead, he is really utilizing a caricature of a rich, whipped, neurotic yuppie to skewer the image of life at the top.  His character (even though he is essentially playing himself), bumbles, complains, talks himself into painful situations, and is ultimately served devilishly funny comeuppance from episode to episode.  This self-deprecating humor wouldn't work for anybody else, but for a guy like Larry David, this material works perfectly, because he seems so easy to laugh at (and I have a feeling this is hardly accidental, which is why his comedy is truly brilliant.)  I really have to marvel at the idea of anyone NOT being able to laugh at this show. It's the greatest comedic take on life and the human condition that has ever been captured on film.  All other television comedies of this era pale in comparison.  ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is possibly the salvation of true comedy TV, in an age when good television comedies are few and far between.",/review/rw8453688/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2022,Supermanfan-13,9," Laugh Out Loud Funny!
","Curb Your Enthusiasm is easily one of my all-time favorite comedies! It has stayed ridiculously funny throughout its entire run and has been just as funny as Seinfeld (which is saying something because Seinfeld is an all-time great). If you don't find this show funny then something is wrong with you. It's hilarious! Larry David is just a flat out genius, he's responsible for two of the funniest shows ever created in Curb Your Enthusiasm and Seinfeld!",/review/rw8453688/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Larry David is a genius!
","What can you say about Curb Your Enthusiasm that hasn't already been said? This doesn't have a laugh track and doesn't rely on corny one liners to make it funny. There will never be another Seinfeld but this comes awfully close. Every interaction, every conversation will make you laugh out loud. It's easily one of my all-time favorite comedies! It hooked me during season 1 and never let go. It has stayed ridiculously funny throughout its entire run and has been almost as good as Seinfeld (which is saying something because Seinfeld is also an all-time great). If you don't find this show funny then that's on you because it's freaking hilarious! Larry David is just a flat out genius, he's responsible for two of the funniest shows ever created in Curb Your Enthusiasm and Seinfeld!",/review/rw8453688/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2005,jotix100,10," Arrest your eagerness!
","There are few men working on television today that rival the wit, the insight, or the genius of Larry David. To compare ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" to ""Seinfeld"" is preposterous. With ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", Larry David has created one of the greatest comedic series one have ever seen on American television. Fortunately for us, we got hooked right away from his first year and we sadly miss a new installment, which we thought would be forthcoming in the 2004-2005 season.",/review/rw8453688/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2022,tkdlifemagazine,9," The Best Parts of 'Seinfeld""
","I was never a fanatic of Seinfeld when it was in first run; however, I did like it. Larry David's foray into the world of cable and the device of using his Seinfeld success to create a show around the real George Costanza is nothing short of brilliant. The show is cringeworthy at times but always entertaining and always very funny. The characters, like in Seinfeld, are rich and laughable. Larry manages to carry the show but he leaves so much room for so many people to shine- from Jeff Garland to Susie Essman to the terrific JB Smooth. Is this really Larry? Is this scripted or free form? Is this how Hollywood and TV really functions? I am not sure and do not care. I just know its funny and original and I am glad it is coming back for more.",/review/rw8453688/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2022,tindfoting,8," The best comedy since Seinfeld
","It took time. Larry Davids own, personal bubble took me 3 seasons getting into. By then I was sold. It's simply fantastic, with Larrys view on his surroundings, with cameo stars playing obnoxious versions of themselves. Picking a favorite is almost impossible, but the one driving to a porn stars dinner party is fun as hell. Specially when Larry fails to mention to Cheryl the guy is a porn actor. After 6 seasons, I felt the air went out of it. You have standout seasons like the Seinfeld reunion, but IMHO Leon is more irritating than funny. The last season (so far) was a complete letdown, with an ongoing stream story about making a ""Young Larry"" series. TBF, it takes the piss on studio execs on Netflix, Hulu, etc, which is funny as hell. The first 6 seasons a near perfect 9/10,the last 4-5 between 7-8. And just to put in perspective it's long run; Ted Danson looks 25 years older from 1st to last season.",/review/rw8453688/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2006,TomiusJ,10," Funny as ever, realistic as hell - one of the best sitcoms of all time.
","Normally, I don't go for the type of sitcom made in the United States. As I'm English, the usual classics like ""Friends"" and ""Seinfield"" don't tend to match out against things like ""The Office"" and ""Peep Show"". Now, it's probably because I'm British that I've developed these comedy tastes, but I am in no way against the sort of stuff the USA turn out. ""Scrubs"", ""Home Improvement"" and ""South Park"" are some of my favourite shows of all time, all funny in their own ways. Recently I invested in series one of a very different show, something that I thought I'd buy after seeing a few clips on a TV special. ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is the king of sitcoms - and here's why.",/review/rw8453688/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2000,Tommy N,," This might be the most brilliant TV show ever.
","After missing Larry David's much heralded HBO Special which was the pilot for this masterpiece, on premiere night I was treated with a show that seems to be a bit of Seinfield and Larry Sanders, or maybe even more.",/review/rw8453688/?ref_=tt_urv

26 September 2022,Andfinally,10," Funniest show ever
","Much of the script is improvised in this hilarious show about the creator of Seinfeld and his misadventures around LA. Larry David plays himself, a misanthrope who is forever getting into social scrapes. If you are sceptical, watch season 8 episode 3.",/review/rw8453688/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2012,blanche-2,8," Totally outrageous
","In one way, it's easy to explain the chicanery that goes on during ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" by stating that the model for Larry David on his creation, ""Seinfeld"" was George Costanza. The other thing is that during a documentary about ""Seinfeld,"" David said when the show got an order for 14 shows after its original four, he went home and cried in his bed. He didn't know how he was going to write 14 shows; he had so much difficulty with the first four.",/review/rw8453688/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2020,Horror-yo,8," All in all remarkable
","If you've been around comedy series long enough, you'll know it takes a certain kind of indulgence to get into the rhythm of the thing, to the point where the plot often becomes too convoluted or too particular (if the series takes place in a specific field for example). The thing about Larry David and his humor is that anybody, from any culture or background, could understand at least what the main point of the episode is, and understand what the humor is conveying. It doesn't necessarily cater to the American, upper middle class, L.A./N.Y. crowd, which is what we see of most onscreen. It's just so easy to watch, and so intuitive it requires little effort to fully immerse into an episode. The character Larry lives the fancy life of a successful wealthy old guy, but he doesn't behave like one, which shatters the boundaries of social class and even culture. He sees everything from his own personal point of view, and will contest anything and everything he deems unfair, whether christian or jewish, black or white, rich or poor, handicapped or able-bodied, male or female.",/review/rw8453688/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2022,makavelix5,10," Mostly perfect but sometimes Larry char is too annoying
",The show is everything i wanted. It's George from Seinfield with better plots in real world. It's great when Larry deals with little problems and those become mountains. But sometimes he becomes ''ANNOYING OLD MAN'' which is where it loses its magic.,/review/rw8453688/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2019,Ruskington,9," Pretty, pretty good
","I can certainly understand why many people don't like this show. The improv style is something of an acquired taste, there isn't much of a storyline at any point and Larry David himself (or at least this exaggerated version of him) is a bit of a polarizing figure. However, I personally consider it one of the best TV comedies ever made. It took me a while to really get a feel for it, and I stopped and restarted more than once, but once you get into it there's really nothing else like it. It's also one of the only shows I have seen that has maintained its standards all the way through. We're talking 90 episodes of consistent brilliance with barely a dip. Most comedies run dry after 2 or 3 seasons so it's a credit to the writing and acting that Curb Your Enthusiasm has stood the test of time so well.",/review/rw8453688/?ref_=tt_urv

Unfortunately, my children do not share my opinion and I had to search awhile to find someone with the same enthusiasm for Larry David's humor. I always find, at least one thing in each of his episodes to send me laughing for all of the good reasons, loud and long! This humor is so therapeutic for me and makes my day.
