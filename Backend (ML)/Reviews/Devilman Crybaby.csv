27 April 2020,cricketbat,5," A childhood favorite that is now in an awkward phase
","I remember liking Blank Check when I was younger. And I was excited to show it to my children. It hasn't aged well. This is like a knock-off Home Alone that didn't really understand how the formula works, and it stretches plausibility almost to the breaking point. Also, I get that this is a childhood fantasy story, but the relationship between 11-year-old Preston and 30-year-old Shay borders on creepy. I don't regret watching it again, but I don't think this will make it into our regular family rotation of films.",/review/rw0334964/?ref_=tt_urv

","Yeah, this movie sucks the big one. Read the other reviews, ALMOST everything that needs to be said has been said already. There is however, one big thing that other reviews have either not mentioned enough of or forgot about entirely, and that's how terrible the main character's parents are!",/review/rw0334964/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2016,SnoopyStyle,4," money obsessed kids movie
","Preston Waters is a young boy with no money. His older brothers are taking over his room for their business. His grandma's birthday check isn't enough to open a bank account. Escaped robber Carl Quigley (Miguel Ferrer) threatens bank president Edward Biderman (Michael Lerner) and orders him to launder his stolen money. Carl is sending Juice (Tone Loc) the next day to cash a check. Outside the bank, Carl almost runs over Preston with his car and destroys his bike. Carl gives Preston a check but fails to write down an amount as he rushes away before the cops arrive. Preston fills in $1 million. Biderman mistakes Preston for the expected Juice and hands over the money. Preston creates a fake identity Macintosh to buy a mansion, hire chauffeur Henry, woo bank teller Shay Stanley (Karen Duffy) who turns out to be an undercover cop, and throw a big birthday party.",/review/rw0334964/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2010,raisleygordon,," ""Home Alone"" meets ""Richie Rich""
","This is an obvious attempt to rip off 'Home Alone' and 'Richie Rich', which, coincidentally, both star Macaulay Culkin. If Culkin were young enough to play this part, I have no doubt he'd pull it off, if he did play it. In the case of the Home Alone-rip-off, instead of robbers you have money launderers. Preston's family is similar to that of Home Alone's: His brothers hate him (or at least act like they do). You've got all the elements here for a movie about a kid living in an adult world, except for one thing: a child his own age. That is one crucial thing that's never explored or mentioned here. Just think of the comic possibilities of the movie if he were trying to impress someone his own age, or at least slightly older. But those are just suggestions in an otherwise hilarious family comedy! *** out of ****",/review/rw0334964/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2005,Andreas_N,7," Far-fetched but acceptable
","Yeah, I remember this one! Many years since I actually watched it. The story was entirely surreal, but nonetheless great! What anyone who rates and reviews movies ought to bear in mind is what the respective movie aims at. It's the same with ""First Kid"", which follows a similar pattern. Certain movies - like this one here - just aim at plain and comical nonsense. Such movies can't be rated from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer. Of course these movies lack quality, lack a sophisticated storyline, very often lack first-class acting, but if they do fulfil their primary premise - that's okay. I don't have this movie here on my list of all-time favorites, but I still thought it was funny, had some very enjoyable sequences and made a good story. Brian Bonsall is a smart actor anyway.",/review/rw0334964/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2005,Lady_Targaryen,8," Quick thinking landed him a million bucks... now everybody's after it!
","Preston Waters, a 11 years old boy,has problems with his parents and brothers specially because of money issues. He is crazy to have his own house and his own rules,since his brothers always stole his saved money and his parents neglect his wishes. One awful day, Preston was riding his bicycle; It was the same day that the villain of the story,Quigley, was trying to scape from the Police and accidentally ran the car over Preston's bike. Needing to be far away from the police, Quigley gives in a hurry, a check to cover the damages of Preston's bike. The problem was: It was a blank check! Preston is a clever boy and decides to have a high price on that check: 1 million dollars! All that money gives Preston things that he always wished for, like a mansion with pool,lots of toys, and even a limousine! The problems start to begin when the FBI and Quigley wants to know where the money is, making Preston in a hard situation and facing many problems.",/review/rw0334964/?ref_=tt_urv

13 June 2005,ckmec-1,6," Former child star proves his worth in this light tale
","Little Preston Waters (Brian Bonsall) is down on his luck. He needs money. Badly. He attends a little brat's birthday party and after seeing all his big-spending friends and the birthday boy, decides it's time for a change. Now we know his own special day is approaching. His thrifty father provides him with an $11 check, and as he goes down to his local bank to cash it, a recently-released thief named Carl Quigley(played convincingly by Miguel Ferrer) runs over his little bicycle. Eager to avoid the police, Quigley gives the kid a blank check and takes off. The check has fallen into the wrong hands, as Preston fills it in for a cool $1m and what do you know, has no trouble cashing it! Things get worse for the boy after a spending spree, as the money will eventually disappear, and a certain someone will be longing for that fortune. ",/review/rw0334964/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2017,robloxhihellorobloxhi,1," Worst movie I've ever seen (The writers should be arrested)
","Me and my friend decided to make fun of a terrible movie because, why not? Well we didn't expect to see this horror of a film full of pedophilia and cringy dialogue. The main character's parents are jerks and huge idiots and no one thinks it's suspicious that a kid is handling this millionaires finances...or that the millionaire is spending all his money on toys...all of it. The main FBI agent (Chasey,Janice or something like that) agreed to date the ten year old main character in about six years. Very wrong. On top of that she kissed him on the lips and we closed safari at that point, not wanting to see how much further the movie would go. Awful movie, do not watch, not even for fun. It's not even funny how bad this movie is.",/review/rw0334964/?ref_=tt_urv

17 August 2014,StevePulaski,8," A kid's fantasy brought to life to be unfairly criticized
","Blank Check is probably the best film that could've been made from such a materialistic idea, with a warm-hearted aura quietly ghosting around every scene and a collection of competently-handled scenes that make a fairly strong film. The story opens showing a convicted bank robber Carl Quigley (Miguel Ferrer) escape from prison, to which he immediately obtains a million dollars he had hidden for quite sometime. Before long, we meet ten-year-old Preston Waters (Brian Bonsall), who finds himself constantly pushed around by his investment-banker father, who continues to bask in the light of frugality. After receiving a blank check from his grandmother, Preston asks his dad to fill it out, to which he puts down only $11.00. All Preston wants is a little spending money so he can buy some toys and feel like he has some sort of freedom, rather than being confined to anything other than pocket change.",/review/rw0334964/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2021,d_stack04,2," Wow....just....wow
","I remember enjoying this one as a child (8yo when it came out) and I decided to rewatch it on Disney+. Outside of the terrible pacing, worse dialogue and some of the weirdest ADR editing I've ever seen, there's so much about this movie that doesn't hold up.",/review/rw0334964/?ref_=tt_urv

","Preston Waters' father Fred is tight with money. After all, investments are how he makes his living. But Preston does not get to spend money like the other kids.

17 July 2005,lmntathffan,1," This is the kind of movie that makes you want to throw up
","Bad Actors, bad filming, choppy dialog, shallow characters, but then again it was a bad premise in the first place. Basically, an 11 year old who is bullied because he has very little money is given a blank check by a moronic criminal. Of course, the 11 year old happens to possess enough technology and intelligence to purchase a house, cash a check for 1,000,000 dollars, and even foil three bumbling idiots, reminiscent of the three stooges.

27 March 2021,blacklist-1,6," One of my fav childhood films, that is still a guilty pleasure all these years later!
","Oh man! I loved watching Blank Check as a kid! The amount of times I viewed this in my childhood I've lost count. The story of Preston Waters (Brian Bonsall) getting a blank check from a guy in a car who totally ruins his bike, and cashes it in for one million dollars brings back a lot of nostalgic memories of viewing. He gets filthy rich and goes on a spending spree, but soon gets into more trouble than he bargained for when the money he stole comes back to haunt him in more ways than one.",/review/rw0334964/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2004,jdarryls,10," It is for Fun, not to make a statement about the meaning of life!
","This is a good movie.  Something fun about watching money be blown at a super rate, especially from a kid's point of view. Take it for what it is, a fun little movie about a kid's dream coming true, and what a kid might do with $1 million dollars. Don't like it, don't watch it. They make movies for the watchers, not the people that have nothing better to do then complain in their lives.",/review/rw0334964/?ref_=tt_urv

21 April 2003,rosinryanz,1," Utterly Awful!
","Blank Check is easily one of the worst films of the nineties. The plot is completely pointless; its overtones of lonliness are pathetic. Do you really believe a twelve year old acting as a personal assistant for a millionaire could accomplish everything in this film, like buying a mansion for a mere $300 grand. The notion, let alone the bargain-basement price, will only be believed by the most gullible viewers. Please, respect your intelligence and don't watch this awful, awful film.",/review/rw0334964/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 1998,buppy,," ""Blank Check"" is a great movie.
","Brian Bonsall, Karen Duffy, Miguel Ferrer, James Rebhorn, Jayne Atkinson, Michael Lerner, and Tone Loc star in this great movie about how when a child gets a million dollars nothing is impossible. Preston Waters (Brian Bonsall) has just got his bike totally ruined and received a blank check from the guy who ran over it. When he discovers it's blank he writes in One Million Dollars and gets everything he could ever dream of. When he runs into trouble with everybody he realizes being rich isn't all he expected. The whole family will enjoy this movie.",/review/rw0334964/?ref_=tt_urv
