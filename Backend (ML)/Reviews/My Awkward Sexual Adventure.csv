29 July 2011,DICK STEEL,," A Nutshell Review: Captain America: The First Avenger
","Essentially an origin story, this was exactly how I remembered reading the Captain America comic books when I was younger, mostly sticking around how the sickly Steve Rogers (a CG- ed Chris Evans) became the beefcake he was through a top secret military experiment, and his constant battles with his arch nemesis standing for all things Axis powered personified by the Red Skull, played to perfection by Hugo Weaving with a German accented voice as the Johann Schmidt version. At its heart it's a clear cut battle between good and evil, although in this Marvel augmented reality, Evil is aided by the powers of the Cosmic Cube and the megalomaniacal ambitions of Red Skull and his Hydra shock troops, threatening to conquer the globe unless someone can do something about it.",/review/rw2462773/?ref_=tt_urv

27 July 2011,pyrocitor,9," ""I've knocked out Adolf Hitler over 200 times.""
","Considering how fundamentally 'safe' the superhero action film has become in terms of box office and reasonable standards of entertainment, selling Captain America, age-old icon of American propaganda on cinema screens in cynical and economically unstable times could hardly have been a more difficult endeavor – tellingly, the film was marketed simply as The First Avenger in Russia, the Ukraine and South Korea. Indeed, skepticism and uncertainty have riddled the development of the project, which was first pitched as a Jon Favreau ""action comedy"" and later as a brutal, gritty, self-critical postmodern war epic. Such tonal fluctuation mirroring the social/political climate demonstrated that having a successful film with such a politically entwined protagonist, was anything but 'safe' – it's hard to imagine Peter Parker being subjected to the scrutiny of ""military propaganda"" or ""patriotic cheese"" that beset Steve Rogers.

22 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," The First Avenger
","It wasn't that bad of a movie, but undoubtedly it had a few flaws in terms of screenplay. The story itself was fine, and I'm personally a big fan of Captain America's origin story so this movie was a nice watch for me. Maybe not so much if you don't care at all about superheroes such as CA.",/review/rw2462773/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2018,nogodnomasters,9," Do you fondue?
","The movie starts at its WWII origins. Chris Evans plays Steve Rogers a puny 4F man who has lied his way into a military science experiment. Tommy Lee Jones plays an excellent Colonel. Meanwhile evil Nazi Hugo Weaving believing he is Darth Maul, has his own plans for world conquest using sharks with frickin' laser beams. (Just kidding about the sharks.) Rogers is a 90 pound weakling who displays intellect, courage, and guts. He is selected for the military's secret program and is transformed into a muscular super hero. The special effects were very good, although we do know from ""Last Action Hero"" you can't really jump around car roofs. After Rogers is transformed he becomes Captain America to be used as a recruiting tool, as Tommy Lee still has his doubts about the 90 pound weakling.",/review/rw2462773/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2011,Al_The_Strange,8," ""A weak man knows the value of strength.""
","With the imminent ""Avengers"" movie coming next year, only one hero's origin story remains untolduntil now. Falling in line with ""Thor,"" ""Iron Man,"" and ""The Incredible Hulk,"" ""Captain America"" showcases the rise of Steve Rogers as the title character. Unlike the other films, which take place in modern times, this one goes way back to WWII, showing the Captain kicking Nazi butt! With a lot of ""Wolfenstein"" style occult mystique and a slight ""Indiana Jones"" sense of adventure, this movie has a number of solid action sequences, and plenty of imaginative special effects and setpieces. With its references to various characters and concepts of other Mavel movies, it fits into the franchise really well. It might take some stretch of the imagination to believe that Nazis could be this futuristic, but for a superhero movie, it's all good fun.",/review/rw2462773/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2011,ThomasMagnumPI,," THE best big budget movie of 2011
","All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark right on the spot. Captain America First Avenger is such a movie. It's the best big budget movie that I've seen this year. It hits a high standard of excellence by combining a cool plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, charisma, a dash of patriotism, love and puts it all together in one amazing package. This movie will surprise a lot of people with its heart while sacrificing none of the fun. The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character, especially that of underdog Steve Rogers. His never say die attitude and heart of a champion makes this hero more interesting then most. Captain America delivers on every level and does so with great emotional moments and it's a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated.",/review/rw2462773/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2021,andreascaloni,8," VERY GOOD ORIGIN STORY
","During World War II, Steve Rogers, a frail man, is transformed into the super-soldier Captain America and must stop the Red Skull from using the Tesseract as an energy source for world domination. There is a plenty of good performances and pulpy action sequences. The movie has a very good CGI and a beautiful origin story. Captain America The First Avenger is an entertaining ride that doesn't take any significant and creative risks.",/review/rw2462773/?ref_=tt_urv

","Like many comic-book fans I was expecting the worst from this movie. This is not because the character has any less depth than other super-heroes, but I knew that it would be extremely difficult to transition Steve Rogers to film in a serviceable way. The guy is called ""Captain America"" for heaven's sake.",/review/rw2462773/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2012,Baker-63,10," A review and a review of reviews.
","I loved this movie. Captain America has had 3 movies in the past, not counting some 1940s ones which can be excused for being good, that were so awful they make movies like Steel or Green Lantern look good. However, I saw a lot of critiques for this movie that were negative. Now I understand differing opinions and all, but they all followed a formula and each one seemed like griping to the point it was just getting stupid. If you'll indulge me here, I have a list of the repeated ones and a rebuttal to each.",/review/rw2462773/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2011,zardoz-13,10," Red, White, and Blue!!!
","""Rocketeer"" director Joe Johnston's ""Captain America"" amounts to a timeless David versus Goliath tale set in the Marvel Comics' universe where good always trumps evil. Unlike ""Thor"" and ""Green Lantern,"" ""Captain America"" ranks as a thoroughly spectacular but larger-than-life extravaganza with a genuinely charismatic hero struggling against a marvelously malignant villain. Chris Evans' engaging performance as the 'First Avenger' is something else, too! If you recall, Evans had the time of his life several years ago playing egotistical Johnny Storm, aka 'the Human Torch,' in the two ""Fantastic Four"" flicks. Make no mistake; Evans is nothing like he was in those two super heroic sagas. Indeed, ""Captain America"" boasts some amazing special effects, but its best special effect is the sincerity that Evans brings to the role of Steve Rogers. Whether he plays Rogers as either a scrawny, 98-pound zero or a brawny, fleet-footed hero, Evans imparts heart to this $140-million thriller. During the first half of ""Captain America,"" Johnston gradually builds the momentum to let us grow accustomed to Evans as a scrappy little fellow who suffers the wrath of bullies. This pathetic weakling refuses to let anybody keep him down, and it's fun because Evans makes it look so authentic despite the obvious CGI effects. Hugo Weaving registers as the ideal villain who holds the upper hand throughout most of the supercharged shenanigans. Tommy Lee Jones and Hayley Atwell co-star respectively as Captain America's superior and his love interest.",/review/rw2462773/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2011,kunalkhandwala,," Captaining the upcoming Avengers....
","In preparation for its 'Avengers' who assemble next year, Marvel Comics ends the super- heroes showdown this year with its final prequel about the origins of 'Captain America' – the leader of the Avengers. Unlike the hi-tech flamboyance of 'Ironman', the might and super power of 'Thor' and the destructive temper of 'The Incredible Hulk', Captain America has little to offer but his devout patriotism and impenetrable shield as a hero. However, what makes him the captain, is the quintessential quality of compassion within the weakling Steve Rogers, that values both strength and power. After shrinking the kids, playing a live board game, recalling dinosaurs and creating werewolves in his movies, director Joe Johnston takes us back to the World War II era when in the midst of the Nazi turmoil, a country sent its troops to war with one hero, who would save the day for America.

23 July 2011,Scarlet-22,," Uplifting, Moving, Entertaining
","Hard to believe that just three years ago (2008), Marvel made the bold decision to create a single movie universe out of their second-tier heroes (though some may argue that Iron Man is first-tier; IMO, that honor really belongs to Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four...but that's an argument for another time) that would allow them to finally bring The Avengers to the big screen. This plan got off to a hugely successful start with 2008's IRON MAN (9/10) and a decent reboot of THE INCREDIBLE HULK (7/10) later that same year, and started picking up steam when 2010's IRON MAN 2 (8/10) brought War Machine and Black Widow into the picture. This year, THOR (7/10) ushered in a good start to the summer movie season and introduced the malevolently mischievous Loki to the mix while giving us a sneak peek at Hawkeye. Now, Captain America finally gets his chance to shine. How does he do?",/review/rw2462773/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2022,bradykitchen-33648,7," Good start to the best MCU trilogy
",At this point in time I have seen all of the MCU movies to date and I can easily say that Captain America is my favourite Marvel Hero. I think he is my favourite for two reasons one being that he is one of the most fun to watch during action scenes but also the fact that he is a very well grounded character. Caps entire goal is to do more and help in anyway he can which to me makes him the ideal superhero.,/review/rw2462773/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2011,moviexclusive,," An excellent throwback to the straightforward heroism of the past, and a mightily entertaining blockbuster with great humour and loads of thrilling action
","The last of Marvel Comics' superheroes to make its big screen debut before next year's hotly anticipated 'The Avengers' was also the first to debut on print some 70 years ago in Joe Simon and Jack Kirby's Super Soldier series. Captain America was his name, his appearance at the time when the world was in the throes of World War II- though it would be months later before America finally decided to join in the fight following the bombing of Pearl Harbour.",/review/rw2462773/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2011,Doylenf,," Unpretentious, good-humored summer blockbuster has all the required trimmings...
","There's an air of genial and gentle good humor pervading the early scenes in ""Captain America"" whereby we're treated to the scenes involving the scrawny but scrappy young man Steve Rogers before his body transformation into the title hero makes him look like he stepped out of a recruiting poster. And this combination of humor and charm continues even as the tale becomes full of the revenge motif once our hero embarks on his more dangerous course as the man who must fight his nemesis, The Red Skull, rescuing the world as well as his good buddy from enemy hands. CHRIS EVANS is highly capable of making us believe in his ""Captain America,"" before and after the transformation.",/review/rw2462773/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2011,neil-476,," Very enjoyable
","This summer of 2011 has certainly been a summer for super-hero movies, with the one I have been least looking forward to coming last. And, if not the best, it is as good as the best. In fact, my only real reservation derives from the fact that Captain America has never been a character which does very much for me (and, even after the movie, which I enjoyed immensely, he still doesn't).",/review/rw2462773/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2011,hbenthow,9," A great, old-fashioned adventure that towers above its flaws.
","As there's something about the the 1930s-1940s that appeals to me, I tend to prefer movies set in the era and made in its cinematic style. And being fond of the adventure genre, I anticipate movies like the Indiana Jones trilogy, ""The Rocketeer"", ""Sky Captain And the World of Tomorrow"", ""The Mummy"" (1999) and, of course, ""Captain America"".",/review/rw2462773/?ref_=tt_urv

24 July 2011,jonnyhavey,," America's Underdog: Retrofied and Wow-Factor-Free
","This is the first ""Avengers'"" film from Marvel's contemporary franchise that puts aside imprudent jokes and replaces them with retrofied art direction and an old-fashioned superhero scheme powered by superbly written characters. However, while ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" avoids being classically campy, it falls short of being great with its lack of a wow-factor. Therefore, the film wields a double-edged sword tapping into new comic adaptation ground, but still suffering from clichés and an underwhelming predictable end of the world plot. Consequently, the real triumph in the film comes from Chris Evans's (""Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World"") portrayal of Steve Rogers. He becomes a star straying away from his arrogant roots; instead embodying a meek, courageous, man aspiring to serve in the U.S. army in World War II. After Rogers was rejected from the service numerous times because of his small stature and health issues, Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci, ""Easy A"") sees his valor. Erskine then offers Rogers a chance of a lifetime allowing him to join the army under the command of Colonel Chester Phillips's (Tommy Lee Jones, ""No Country for Old Men""). The Colonel begins to doubt Erskine's decision, but Rogers's courage allows him to transform into America's hero with the help of Howard Stark's (Dominic Cooper, ""An Education"") technology. Now Captain ""Rogers"" America must lead a group of soldiers on a quest to kill a Nazi named Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving, ""Lord of the Rings"") who delves into a mystic power changing himself into the infamous Red Skull.",/review/rw2462773/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2011,TourettesPersonal,8," Retro Blast
","Captain America: The First Avenger is a pretty decent film by its own merits. Showing the good old retro style and production design, since this film is directed by Joe Johnson who is capable of portraying the old times perfectly. Chris Evans did a great job as Captain America. Some of the action scenes are disappointingly unexciting but at least the CGI effects are eye candy. The movie ends with true patriotic heroism and full of heart. Definitely not new but it's still enjoyable.",/review/rw2462773/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2011,griffolyon12,9," Sometimes you've gotta love America!
","As just a kid from Brooklyn, Captain America makes a name for himself in this extremely entertaining and engaging superhero flick. Like Superman, Captain America is Marvel Comics answer to the Red, White, and Blue, and while this movie could have been a simple set up to Marvel's The Avengers, it manages to be its own movie. Part of this is because it takes place first in the timeline of all of the Marvel Studios' movies, so there are fewer references to the other heroes who come later down the line, but this movie also focuses on showing the transformation of Steve Rogers, from scrawny kid getting beat up in the alleys of Brooklyn, to the symbol of hope for America in World War II.",/review/rw2462773/?ref_=tt_urv
