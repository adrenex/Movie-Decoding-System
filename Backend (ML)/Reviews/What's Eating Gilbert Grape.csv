2 July 2002,chrisbrown6453,7," Much like the spirit of films like The Hurricane and Glory, Men of Honor grips us and makes us really feel for a man struggling to make his dream come true.
","Men of Honor stars Cuba Gooding Jr., as real life Navy Diver Carl Brashear who defied a man's Navy to become the first African American Navy Diver. Sometimes by his side and sometimes his adversary there was one man who Carl Brashear really admired. His name was Master Chief Billy Sunday (Robert DeNiro). Sunday in a lot of ways pushed, aggravated and helped Carl become the man he wanted to be. ",/review/rw0655237/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2001,FlickJunkie-2,7," An inspirational story with some shortcomings
","Military training films are becoming so common that they are becoming a genre unto themselves.  Among the more prominent we have, `Officer and a Gentleman', `Top Gun', `GI Jane', and now `Men of Honor'.  The fact that this one happened to be true doesn't change the fact that the formula is the same.  This film is probably most like `GI Jane' since it focuses on the desegregation angle.",/review/rw0655237/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2000,mermatt,," Story of human dignity
","This well-acted story of the end of segregation in the military is told through the true experiences of Carl  Brashear. Ultimately it is a story of human honor and dignity triumphing over smallmindedness, bureaucracy, and prejudice. Some of the scenes are deliberate attempts at crowd-pleasing, but they are nevertheless effective.",/review/rw0655237/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2003,grahamsj3,7," Very good film!
","This one is a great one! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding have teamed up to make a powerful and very influential film. This is the true story of the first black US Navy diver and the obstacles he faced in attaining his certification at the hands of a racist Master diver. Along the way, he must also face plain old bigotry from all of his classmates, none of whom want him in their class. They move out of the barracks when he arrives. Ultimately, he becomes certified and goes on to have a great career as a US Navy diver. Watch this one! It's a great tale of courage and honor. As the story unfolds, we get to watch racism slowly dissipate and everyone begins to respect men one at a time.",/review/rw0655237/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2006,cseon,10," The movie tells the story of a Professional Navy Man.
","This film is an excellent military movie. It may not be an excellent Hollywood Movie, but that does not matter. Hollywood has a reputation of sacrificing accuracy for good entertainment, but that is not the case with this movie. Other reviewers have found this movie to be too slow for their taste, but  as a retired Soldier  I appreciate the pace the movie crew deliberately took to tell their story as completely as possible given the two hours and nine minutes allotted. The story itself has been told and retold several times over, but it remains for a professional soldier  and an African American at that  to report on the story as presented by the movie crew, and as it presents the US Navy to the world. The story of Brashear's work to become a Navy Diver, and his life as a Navy Diver beyond his graduation, is not the only story that is presented. There I also the story of how Master Chief Petty Officer Sunday defied the illegal order of his Commanding Officer that Petty Officer 2nd Class Brashear not be passed in his test dive no matter how well he did, and paid the price of a loss of one Stripe and a change of assignment. It also told the true story how Brashear found the third Hydrogen Bombs lost in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Spain in the 1950's, and how he saved the life of another seaman who was in the line of the snapped running line that would have snapped him in two if Brashear had not shoved him out of the way and took the shot himself. This was a complex story that was worth telling, and I will admit that two hours and nine minutes was not enough to tell the full story, and I can tell from the deleted scenes on the DVD that the crew tried their best to tell a story as full as possible. As a professional soldier, I was proud to see such a great story told in such a comprehensive manner, and to see the traditions and honor of the navy preserved in such a natural and full manner.",/review/rw0655237/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2006,PersianPlaya408,8," A great film from George Tillman Jr.
","TIllman Jr.'s drama about the first African American Navy Master Diver (Gooding Jr.), who defies all odds and achieves his goals despite a strict embittered trainer. The screenplay is not bad, a bit extreme at times, but the direction and acting is first-rate, and this film is inspiring and achieves what its supposed to do. I liked DeNiro in the lead, although its not on par with his masterful works (taxi driver, godfather and all the others) it is as good as his other good performances such as in King of Comedy or Angel Heart. DeNiro is always convincing and believable here, very good performance, Gooding Jr. is not bad, definitely one of his better performances. --- IMDb Rating: 6.6, my rating: 9/10",/review/rw0655237/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2002,Special-K88,," very honorable
","Familiar but triumphant true story set in the 1950s about a man and his determination to defy the odds. Gooding gives a rock solid performance as an ambitious Navy diver whose iron will leads him to fight discrimination and try to become the first ever colored master diver. Along the way he matches wits with—and eventually gains the respect of—his belligerent, hard-nosed superior (De Niro). Considering the film's definite Rocky formula you'll probably be a step ahead of the story at every turn, but it's well-directed, acted with such great conviction, and has a finale so powerful and moving that you almost have to go along for the ride. A compelling and gripping story of will and determination. ***",/review/rw0655237/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2003,sddavis63,7," The Man Who Wouldn't Quit
","The inspiring story of Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black man who grew up in poverty in Kentucky and then joined the US Navy, aspiring to be the first black Master Diver in Navy history. We are shown the series of struggles from boyhood on that Brashear has to overcome to make his dream come true (and then to keep it alive.) Not the least of the challenges was Master Diver Bill Sunday (Robert DeNiro), the head trainer at the diving school the Navy sends Brashear to, who is not especially sympathetic to Brashear's goals, but who ultimately becomes an unlikely friend and supporter.",/review/rw0655237/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2019,ma-cortes,7," Exciting and enjoyable film based on a true story concerning the first African-American to break the color barrier in the US Navy's diving
","An epic story inspired by the life of Carl Brashear, a man who battled the obstacles of racism, and intolerance , in spite his lack of education . The film starred Oscar winning actors Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Robert De Niro with a well ensembled support cast . This is the stirring story of Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding Jr , his magnifent acting certainly does the man justice) , being a straight-forward tribute to this historical hero , the first African-American U.S. Navy Diver in line of duty who broke barriers in the diving program . Regarding his problematic existence , being shown his rise from a simple sharecropper's son to a brave military man . Embodying the strength of will never to take for an answer , and furthermore , dealing with the man (Robert De Niro as coach captain Sunday) who trained him , a racist training officer whose discrimination nearly kills him on several occassions before Carl earns Sunday's respect . Carl come across the very embodiment of perseverance and he goes on his advanced career with a big success until a fateful accident . Tough enough for any able-bodied man , but even the loss a limb on a shipboard accident doesn't deter Carl from his dedication into line to duty .",/review/rw0655237/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2019,planktonrules,8," Inspiring...and generally true.
","""Men of Honor"" is a movie inspired by the navy career of Carl Brashear. What 'inspired by' means is that the story is mostly true but in Hollywood tradition, certain story elements were made up or embellished. The character played by Robert De Niro, for example, was not a single person but an amalgum of two...and Brashear's multiple marriages aren't discussed. However, compared to many Hollywood biopics, it's pretty close to the true story of the man...and an inspiring story it is.",/review/rw0655237/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2006,buffychic_813,10," Men of Honor
","I loved this movie. It is a definite inspirational movie. It fills you with pride. This movie is worth the rental or worth buying. It should be in everyones home. Best movie I have seen in a long time. It will make you mad because everyone is so mean to Carl Brashear, but in the end it gets better. It is a story of romance, drama, action, and plenty of funny lines to keep you tuned in. I love a lot of the quotes. I use them all the time. They help keep me on task of what I want to do. It shows that anyone can achieve their dreams, all they have to do is work for it. It is a long movie, but every time I watch it, I never notice that it is as long as it is. I get so engrossed in it, that it goes so quick. I love this movie. I watch it whenever I can.",/review/rw0655237/?ref_=tt_urv

23 April 2001,CharltonBoy,8," Two great performances in an average movie.
","Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Jnr are the shining lights in this movie and they make the film what it is,which is a very entertaining flick that could do better. De Niro has been critisised recently for the films he has chosen and even some of his performances. His performance in this is outstanding but i do question the the movie he has picked again. Men of Honor has the potential to be a great film but it never quite gets there. The script is ok, nothing special,and the story could have told in far more interesting way. The first half of the film is very uninspiring and slow but it does pick up a head of steam and finishes on a high that leaves the viewer satisfied. 8 out of 10 (just)",/review/rw0655237/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2015,anaconda-40658,6," The Leads Are Honorable.
","Men of Honor (2000): Dir: George Tillman Jr. / Cast: Cuba Gooding Jr., Robert De Niro, Charlize Theron, Michael Rapaport, Hal Holbrook: A film about traction between two men from different backgrounds and how unity brings about peace. Based on a true story of the first black diver to graduate from the Navy. He is played by Cuba Gooding Jr. and seen by Master Chief Billy Sunday as the best diver on board. Sunday abuses those around him and has been discharged many times. Gooding succeeds and is tutored with the academic elements by his future wife. There are obvious issues involving race but the screenplay becomes distracted with Gooding's romance, and the introduction of Sunday's wife who is constantly drunk. Fine setup follows regrettable clichés and a conventional ending that isn't totally on par with Sunday's change of heart. Directed by George Tillman Jr., who previously made Soul Food. Gooding is superb as a guy who beats the odds even at the cost of losing a leg. De Niro steals his scenes as Sunday. Charlize Theron and Michael Rapaport are featured in flat roles that seem written as plot conveniences as oppose to personalities. While the film proves that a person can beat the odds, it also proves that any subject with potential can be brought down with clichés and unnecessary footage that could have deemed the material no honor.

","This film really depicted the racism in the days before civil rights. De Niro did an excellent, if not exhausting job, of playing Sunday, whose racism was disturbing and despicable. Cuba Gooding was outstanding as Brashear who held his ground to become a master diver. His calm perserverance, when most men would have walked away, convinced me that the character, whom he played, was a true man of honor. It was difficult to see Sunday as a man of honor since he brought all of his problems on himself. In the end, he somewhat redeemed himself, but only after becoming a powerless, broken man. The tension, between them, was played off very well.",/review/rw0655237/?ref_=tt_urv
