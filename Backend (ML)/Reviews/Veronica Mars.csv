16 January 2020,unhealthyobsession,8," I like it
","I don't understand all the hate from all the review. Okay, it's not mind-blowingly awesome, nor is it groundbreaking in anyway, but I thoroughly enjoy it. It's simple, funny, sarcastic, and relate-able. Being broke and working to achieve their dreams -- that's every millennial's story. The contrast between an optimistic former rich girl and a pessimistic middle-class girl, combined with dark, pun-y, sarcastic humor, and you got yourself a nice evening entertainment after a really long day.",/review/rw7396474/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2021,jeffgintz,10," Surprisingly awesome
","The jokes are low class, trashy, offensive... and funny. I don't want to like it. I don't want to laugh. I just like it and laugh every episode. Some things in life you can't explain. You just sit back and enjoy the ride.",/review/rw7396474/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2013,wahoo8888,2," I Keep Waiting for it to Get Better
","After I first saw the ads for this show, I thought it would be funny. After I saw the first few episodes, I thought it would get better. After I watched the first season, I thought Season 2 would be an improvement. Zero stars for me. This show actually has gotten worse. The acting is so bad it is often excruciating. It seems that the 2 broke girls are just reading punch lines from a cue card. And apparently the writers believe that the more off-color the joke, the funnier. And would somebody please tell the actors that talking really loud does not make this miserably written show any funnier either. I guess the network agrees with me since the shows has been downgraded to the 8:30 time slot. Next stop...Saturday night.",/review/rw7396474/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2016,weasl-729-310682,9," Always Makes Me Smile
","There seems to be an awful lot of hate for this award nominated and sometimes winning series. It's not for prudes, that is for sure, but if you can let go of your hangups for a while, you might enjoy it quite a bit. The overall star-rating seems to be better than the reviews, so I'm speaking up here, and others who like the series should as well. We are not well represented in the review section.",/review/rw7396474/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2016,spanking_machine,8," In defense of 2 broke girls.
","I started watching this show a while ago, but I never cared enough to visit its page on IMDb until today. Just out of sheer curiosity I googled, I wanted to know more about the actors and writers.",/review/rw7396474/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2011,Sylviastel,," A Must Watch Comedy Show!
","Max and Caroline couldn't be any more different but that's what makes this sitcom work in the first place. Max is dark, blue collar, and works as a waitress in Brooklyn diner. Caroline is the daughter of a Ponzi king, Mr. Channing, who is now in jail and she's completely broke. She gets a job working at the diner alongside Max and a few colorful characters such as Mr. Han, the owner, and Garrett Morris who should be used more in the first place. Caroline is the rich girl with an Ivy league degree who has lost everything. Max has a soft side and welcomes her reluctantly into her life and home. Their friendship is more like they're sisters than anything else. The actresses who play the parts come across as believable and the writing needs a little work but it's still worth watching. The horse, Chestnut, should be included in their credits. While it's silly at times, I really enjoy and look forward to this show on Monday nights.",/review/rw7396474/?ref_=tt_urv

5 April 2017,gtyoshida,7," 2 Broke to Save
","After six seasons, this Whitney Cummings comedy show will thankfully end. The central cast led by Kat Dennings (Max Black) and Beth Behrs (Caroline Channinng) have shone throughout the series although I have never been comfortable with the ""Fonz"" like reception given Jennifer Coolidge (Sophia Kachinsky) when she makes her first appearance in every episode. The biggest downfall of the show has been the long list of handsome boyfriends that have done nothing but weaken a strong, tight ensemble for no apparent reason. Even the cupcake business has opened and closed without ever finding a home. This is the second successful comedy series for Cummings although as a writer, she has simply run out of ideas.",/review/rw7396474/?ref_=tt_urv

22 September 2015,simonw70,1," Absolutely Awful
","Watching 2 Broke Girls or having your brain eaten by zombies... as I sit here forced to watch it, I am wondering which would be worse. There is no dialog as such, just a series of lame punchlines that come every 5 to 10 seconds. All that's missing is a cheesy drumroll, but that would tirn the entire program into a drum solo. The delivery and acting is so bad that your average elementary school nativity play has more talent on offer. The canned laughter punctuates the mindless rhythm of the inane witterings as it drones on and on and on and on and on... It's simply the worst thing I have ever witnessed ever at any time in any country in my life. That anyone could like this in any way is mind boggling.",/review/rw7396474/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2015,chemicalcupcakes,1," Awful awful show
","One of the worst ""sitcoms"" I've ever seen in my life. I've never been compelled to write a review on a television show but with something this awful, I had to. The writers must have thought to themselves ""hey, let's create as many annoying characters as we can and cram them all into one show.""",/review/rw7396474/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2015,LawnBoy-4,1," Truly, truly abysmal
","Admittedly, there is very little programming on network TV that is worth watching (and I'm being kind), but this idiotic, excremental excuse for entertainment represents a new low in sitcom history. The bozos who attempt to function as the ""stars"" have zero talent, the writing is 3rd grade level, if that, and the direction is barely worthy of late night local access fare.",/review/rw7396474/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2015,Leopold005,3," Contains more broke girls than laughs
","Oh dear. I've tried with this show, I really have. For some reason, I keep going back to it and giving it one more shot, but every time I end up disappointed. Surely, at some point, we're going to get a proper laugh out of this, right? I'd settle for a snigger. Or even a brief ""Hah!"" moment. But nothing.",/review/rw7396474/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2012,horseandponyy,," Urgh, turn off the TV and RUN!!

13 December 2011,keziahspafa,10," Hooked!
","At first I didn't think this show would be good. I saw advisements about the show, I heard about it on the radio and I even read summarys about this show. None of them convinced me to watch it. One day, there was nothing on the television except for the pilot of 2 broke girls, so I decided to give it a shot. After watching the pilot, I was hooked! It is such a funny show! The jokes are funny, and easy to understand, so that you aren't watching wondering why the audio audience is laughing. Also, I love how the show is realistic. The show is about two girls, one lives in Brooklyn and has two jobs to survive, one as a waitress as a dinner and another is a nanny for a wealthy family. The other girl is a spoiled rich girl who lost all her money due to her fathers schemes. I love how the show is about how upper class meets lower class, it makes the show comedic and is a new perspective of society",/review/rw7396474/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2017,studioAT,3," Only ever half good
","'Two Broke Girls' is like many other sitcoms on TV today. It has a good premise, it's well written and has a good cast. It also has an obsession with sex, and feels the need to have jokes about it every second line.",/review/rw7396474/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2019,trebordjackson,7," It is one of the most low brow shows in the universe and I like it
","It's about two missfits. One is a spoiled rotten brat who lost all her money, and Max is a street rat that is rough and tough. The are both best friends that want to earn enough money to start a cupcake store. Most of the jokes are sex jokes and slapstick.",/review/rw7396474/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2014,blastergv,1," Still haven't laughed once
","I honestly have only seen a handful of episodes so if this is a show that is mainly plot driven, I may have missed it (i sincerely doubt it). Here are a few observations about what the writers/producers of the show think: raunchy = automatically funny, saying raunchy jokes louder make them automatically funny, delivering cue-card punchlines in an 80's fashion is still funny. I hear the ""punchlines"" and the laugh track and constantly find myself saying ""was that supposed to be the punchline?"". I like every brand of humor and am extremely easy to please in the humor department, and this show is completely unfunny. I really like Kat Dennings too and was hopeful for this show, but there are only 4 reasons this show is somehow still around: each girl has two of them. If you see any 9 or 10 star ratings anywhere, completely ignore them... they were written by marketers.",/review/rw7396474/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2011,nwantee,8," Finally, lets get back to comedy
","I think the girls are great, the banter, the humor, the whole cast...it is funny, witty, charming and makes you feel good. Especially with todays economy, the story of rich girl...her dad goes to jail... now rich girl is poor girl and has to get a job....loses all her rich friends...meets tough, poor, city girl and they become friends. They honestly care about each other. Bad luck (and a fathers legal mistakes) brought them together and it works. It is the new age ""Laverne and Shirley""...I hope it stays around and isn't replaced by some new reality TV show. It makes me laugh out loud! Now I will just write ""love it"" until I get the ten line minimum needed to post...lol...""love it""....""love it""...

",This is the story of two average looking idiots who live in a world where they are the only white people who speak English. Except for all the super model men that they date. I don't even understand where they work. A diner? A cupcake shop? A coffee shop? This is classic CBS trash.,/review/rw7396474/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2011,Mike1388,7," Broke hits the block!
","As an avid series fan, it's always an exciting thing to watch pilot and judge based on it. I've been looking forward to '2 broke girls, mostly because of Kat Dennings (so underrated!). The pilot was good, not great as some other new sitcom (like Happy Ending) but it is much better than other fall comedy show (like Up all night or Deschanel's New girl?). Kat Dennings did great and as surprise as I was her co-star did too. Though the pilot is kinda claustrophobic, going back and forth from the diner they work at to their apartment. I will be looking forward to this, and hopefully there will be more chemistry between the two girls and more hilarious story lines to come.",/review/rw7396474/?ref_=tt_urv
