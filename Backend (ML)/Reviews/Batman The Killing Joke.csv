27 December 2022,bharathkh-54316,10," watched with my sister and my alien friend.
","I dont really talk much (my gun does all the talking) so this is my first review. So when I came to my home after killing that Krubis guy (man that was nuts) my alien friend gene was watching this movie and me and my sister had an argument with gene just before watching this movie, she wanted him to move out but I wanted him to stay because I wanted his bounty hunting equipments. And it seems my sister got a new alien boyfriend, she says they are just friends but me and gene know that she is lying, she is my only family right now I dont want her to leave me for her new boyfriend. My mom and dad are missing I dont know where to find them. So I am doing this bounty hunting thing so I might come across them. Anyway so about the movie, yeah it was great, I liked the part where they crushed his nuts, oh boy it was so satisfying (my talking knife really liked it, it wanted to cut and gouge those balls). Unfortunately I couldn't complete the movie but I liked what I saw , so it's 10/10 for me.",/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2000,Aizyk,8," Yes! It's good! (Bad-good)
","I was channel surfing the other night on DirectTV, and came across this movie with the wacky title. When I read the nutty plot description and noticed that it starred Ellen Dubin (from Lexx) and Denise Richards in an early role, I selected it out of curiosity. I expected to watch it for maybe five minutes and then get bored and turn to something else. I ended up, however, being really surprised by how entertaining I found this film to be. I knew I had to see what other people at IMDb thought about it. And just as I expected, almost everyone here hated it. I'm not surprised that most people don't ""get"" this movie. Those without any sense of camp will have no appreciation for it.",/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2002,Hastor-2,7," Pure B movie goodness.
","Everyone says this movie is bad, of course it is... do you think the people were actually serious when they made it? NO! It is to be enjoyed as a B movie. It shows a T-rex make a phone call, then check the pay phone for change after he's done, then it shows him crying with tears pouring from his eyes. I assure you no one thought they were making a great cinematic moment, they were just being silly. If you can't appreciate this movie for what it is, then you shouldn't be reviewing B-movies. They weren't made for you.",/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2020,Woodyanders,8," ""It was a dinosaur!"" Simply astonishing campy hoot.
",High school kid Michael (likable Paul Walker in an early substantial role) gets killed by high school bullies. Mad scientist Dr. Wachenstein (gloriously overplayed with lip-smacking hammy aplomb by Terry Kiser) transplants Michael's brain into a giant robotic T-Rex dinosaur. The T-Rex proceeds to get revenge on the teens responsible for his death and reunites itself with his girlfriend Tammy (a super foxy and radiant Denise Richards in her first lead part).,/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2020,redwedding,7," GORE CUT Is immensely fun.
","I've never seen the original cut of this movie, but I can tell you right now that the gore cut of this film is one the best experiences I've ever had showing my friends a vinegar syndrome release.",/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2020,juderussell-84094,7," Troma Meets The Family Channel
","One of the greatest ""how did they pitch this?"" movies I've ever seen. I, somehow, avoided the PG-13 cut all these years and only recently witnessed the new uncut Vinegar Syndrome cut and I can't even imagine how they trimmed down this fairly gory movie into a PG-13. It's filled to the brim with Troma/early Peter Jackson style gore and the tone of the film is very similar as well.",/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2018,TheMovieDoctorful,6," One of My Biggest Guilty Pleasures
","There are 2 kinds of bad dinosaur movies; the painful ones and the fun ones. This is one of the latter. I think Tammy and the T-Rex was kind of destined to be a guilty pleasure of mine from the very beginning. It hits so many notes for things I enjoy and resonate with, most of them subjective, that I just can't help but love it. I love the 90s culture, I love dinosaurs, I love camp, I love Terry Kiser, I love Denise Richards and I love Beauty & the Beast stories. I was also a leather jacket wearing dork in High School who briefly dated a cheerleader at one point and have a flamboyantly gay close friend. This movie has all of those things and you're telling me I'm not supposed to enjoy it? Yeah, right.",/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2020,rivertam26,7," A goofy, fun guilty pleasure
","Or is it Tanny and the T rex because that's utterly confusing. This movie is a mess but it's also a big guilty pleasure. From the director of Mannequin 2 and Mac and Me comes the tale of a young girl whose boyfriend is murdered and his brain is implanted in a t rex. This R rated cut is wonderfully goofy and gory and it's a perfect example of something so bad that it's good. It can be a little much at times but it mostly works. It also stars a very young Paul Walker and a career best Denise Richard's which is kinda scary, lol. All in all it's a fun, goofy mess that just works.",/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv

15 November 2020,ekontrovitz,8," OMG! Fun.
","This is cheesy horror at its best, or should I say worse! This is hilariously good and bad. Watch it, for sure.",/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2003,ortega-1,," Excellent Trash Movie
","I bought this film merely because of Denise Richards, who I think is one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood. I was deceived by the title and the picture, both of which made me think it was a movie for children. Boy, was I wrong. This is a Trash movie, what made me glad that I bought it. Now I can place it among the other titles of my B-Movies collection. Is this a bad movie? Of course it is. Surprisingly as it may be for most people, it was made that way ON PURPOSE. And, what may sound even more surprising is that some people (such as myself) really do appreciate this genre of film. Trash, B-movie, whatever you call it, are based in 4 concepts: Hot chick (Denise Richards couldn't be more appropriate), bad acting, cheesy special effects and a ridiculous script. This movie succeeds in all of them.",/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2020,lgshelton,8," GIVE IT A CHANCE
",How have I never heard of this masterpiece? This was fantastic. It actually cause genuine laughs. PLEASE GIVE THIS A CHANCE. Is it cheesy? 100%. But y'all. So. Stinking. Good.,/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2011,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,8," Tammy and the T-Rex (1994)
","A monstrously bizarre movie that I loved for some reason. First of all, it looks like some kind of kids film. I guessed Denise Richards would find a dinosaur egg, raise it, the government would want it etc. I couldn't have been more wrong. This was a mid-nineties Frankenstein, filled with adult themes handled in an immature way. Richards ex- boyfriend is an obsessive violent freak, that has no regard for the law. To the point where he leaves Walker in a safari park where he is savagely attacked by a lion. An evil scientist then kidnaps the body (after announcing Walker dead), and puts Walker's brain in a robotic dinosaur. He escapes, kills out of anger, before remembering his love for Richards. Yes, this is terrible, but due to some of its twists and turns, it's just compelling. Richards has a gay best friend that is the son of the sheriff. Some of the other police in town ridicule him behind his back with homophobic comments. When they go to find Walker body to put the brain back in, they find it decayed and rotted, with maggots everywhere. When they look for an alternative body at the morgue, Richards checks out the cadavers penis size to see if she would approve. The kills are often quite violent, before being played for comedy. A man is flattened, and is later rolled up like a poster. It climaxes with a bizarre ""climax"" (wink,wink) which you must see to truly appreciate. This is honestly like a person tricking his way into your affections so that he can corrupt your kids. It's too dark for them, but too childish for you. Kind of like Michael Jackson.",/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv

24 March 1999,Lumbar-2,10," Horribly Hilarious
","This movie is so cheesy, it is the funniest thing I have ever seen! My friends and I all died laughing through the whole movie. You really must see this movie, if only to see how being really bad can actually be a very good thing!",/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2021,skrstenansky,6," Amazingly good fun and garbage
","I absolutely love this film, while it may be terribly made and i dont rate it high is because its honestly a bad movie, but its still fun. Lots of funny moments and ridiculous story with lots of memorable moments that always kept me entertained. One of my favorite trash movies 5.5/10.",/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2022,lfaruqui,," High on life
","Tammy and the T-Rex is a wild ride from start to finish. This cult classic is a must-see for any fan of over-the-top, campy B-movies. The film follows Tammy, a high school student whose boyfriend Michael is turned into a robotic T-Rex after a scientific experiment goes awry.",/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2021,Hey_Sweden,8," Cheesy goodness from the director of ""Mac and Me"".
","""Tammy and the T-Rex"" is an early film vehicle for likeable young actors Denise Richards and Paul Walker. He plays Michael, a high school football player whom Tammy (Richards) really loves, although she's afraid to stop dating a thuggish lunatic named Billy (George Pilgrim, 'The Guiding Light'). Billy and his goons cause Michael to be mauled by a lion one night, and while Michael recuperates in a hospital, his body is spirited away by mad scientist Wachenstein (a typically hilarious Terry Kiser) and his associates. Wachenstein then transfers Michaels' brain into a big animatronic T-Rex. Michael still retains his old memories, naturally, and seeks out the lowlifes that put him into his current situation.",/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2020,questl-18592,6," Tammy T
","B-movie GOLD! Denise Richards in a movie where a mad scientist turns transplants her boyfriend's brain into a ridiculous looking t-Rex? Sign me up! This is so stupid, so absurd, but everyone knows it and goes with it. Such stupid, mindless fun and I was so into it when I watched it. Obviously, this is a ridiculous and bad movie but entertainment counts for something. If you're looking for some serious camp and 90s trash then this might be right up your alley.",/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2019,skirophori,," Very Bad and Very Funny
","I saw the uncut version of this film at an independent theatre tonight, and let me just say: this film is as bad as Troll 2, and much more entertaining. The whole theatre was laughing throughout, and I am definitely planning on making my friends watch this. I cannot speak for the value of the cut version, as I have not seen it and cannot imagine how the film would function in that state. 10/10 for entertainment value, 0/10 for artistic value; don't watch this if you plan to take it at all seriously.",/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2001,Verbal-17,," I thought I'd seen it all...
","I've seen alot of cheesy, bizarre, inexplicable movie scenes, but I've never seen anything that tops the ending of this movie: Denise Richards doing a striptease for a disembodied brain in a salad bowl. The rest of the movie is inexplicably bad, but that one scene alone is worth the price of a rental. I'd suggest fast-forwarding through the rest of it. And by the way, I plan to hold my breath until Terry Kiser makes a comeback.",/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2022,I_Ailurophile,10," An utter delight, perfectly preposterous and entertaining!
","I simply was not prepared for the wild experience this movie was going to be. What could possibly say ""B-movie"" more than a script thrown together haphazardly after the filmmaker gains access to an animatronic tyrannosaur? Everything here is so preposterously, purposefully, unavoidably over the top if not also furiously inauthentic: casting, acting, characters, dialogue, scene writing, narrative, plot development, direction, blood and gore, costume design, production design and art direction, props, fights and action sequences, and more. This is truly a journey into the absurd, and it's difficult in the moment to even fathom a point of comparison. You know what else, though? 'Tammy and the t-rex' is an absolute blast.",/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv

24 July 1999,princess-34,," cheesy....
","I came across this CHEESY flick while watching USA up all night one sat eve and had to laugh...ok the plot was lame and the acting was by no stretch of the imagination amazing, but for late nite laughs how can you go wrong? Plus i went to the same high school as Denise Richards and had no clue that this was a movie she was in until she came onscreen...so of course that made it watchable for me. However for any other joe smoe if you are looking for a little laugh and serious cheese this is the flick for you....",/review/rw5993854/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2020,trashgang,5," really bad that it becomes cheesy and good, and the gore makes it more cheesy
