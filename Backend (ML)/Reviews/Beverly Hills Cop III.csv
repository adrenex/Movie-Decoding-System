18 August 2002,MovieAddict2016,," Absolute hysteria! A great show for kids AND adults!
","Pinky and the Brain has got to be one of the funniest cartoon shows ever. Steven Spielberg himself co-produced this film, and once and a while actually would do a cameo on the show. If you want to see two lab mice, every week trying to take over the world, doing some of the most ridiculous, outrageous things ever see Pinky and the Brain. Just not the spin-off Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain. Yuck, talk about a bad show. The voice talents were great in the show and I loved both the characters. Especially Pinky, the stupid but of course humorous one. Then there's Brain, the brainy idea expert. Together, these two caged lab mice have a great time letting us have a good time. I was so sad when the show stopped airing after three years. I can't find it anywhere now and it makes me mad. I hope someday they do the re-runs on WB because this show is not just for kids, it's got great adult humor too. One of which like I said before, when the mice run into Steven Spielberg. But anyway, if you can find this show on your local listings, watch it. It's an instant classic. NARF!",/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2007,Rectangular_businessman,10," Good for kids and adults
","This was a great cartoon, following the same tradition of the equally good ""Animaniacs"", using a clever style of humor that made it enjoyable for kids and adults as well. Like in ""Animaniacs"" segments about this same two characters, the show follows the frustrated attempts of two mouses to conquer all the world. ",/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Hilarious, cute, brilliantly animated and zany, quite simply a brilliant TV show
","As an avid fan of Animaniacs, I watch this spin off show with the lovable characters Pinky and the Brain religiously, and I love it just as much as Animaniacs. It is simply brilliant and so much fun, something cartoons now should learn from. It is hilarious, cute and zany, and not only is a worthy successor to Animaniacs but almost surpasses it.",/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2001,Op_Prime,," ""This is the earth. And this is Pinky. You can tell the difference quite easily. One is a lump of inert matter hurtling blindly through the void. The other... is the earth.""
","This was one of the best animated shows ever. This show isn't just for kids. The humor of the show can be enjoyed by all ages, much like the classic Warner Brothers shorts. Pinky & the Brain also has great dialogue. The plans to take over the world are also a hoot. Many of the episodes are classic.",/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv

",Next to Animaniacs this has to be the funniest cartoon of the `90s.,/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2004,janey_smile,," Great Fun!!Brill!!
","A spin off from the wonderful 'Animaniacs', 'Pinky and the Brain' was one of the funniest and best cartoons of the 90s.",/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2004,Stephen_Tilson,," Outstanding!
","Two genetically altered lab mice, Pinky, and The Brain, spend each night following Brain's latest plan to try and take over the world. Pinky seems an addle-headed moron who is nevertheless capable of brilliant inspiration, while Brain displays an Einsteinian IQ and an insatiable desire to rule the world. But The Brain has a fatal flaw...",/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2006,words_like_violence_brea,," I strive to becoming brain
","I consider that Pinky and the Brain is exhaustively underrated, I feel that the series should continue as 'Pinky and The Brain' are unquestionably entertaining!",/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2009,planktonrules,9," At its best, it was absolutely amazing
","Pinky and the Brain were originally characters in the highly creative and clever ""Animaniacs"" television show. While neither purported to be high art, as a cartoon that would both interest kids AND adults, they were both amazing shows.",/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2007,BrotherReed,10," One of the best, smartest, and most underrated cartoon shows
","When I discovered that Pinky and the Brain had spun off from Animaniacs and received their own show (the first step towards world domination, no doubt), I was thrilled. The show quickly became a favorite of mine. Now that I have it on DVD many years later, I realize just what a spectacular piece of work it really is.",/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2007,gizmomogwai,9," Brilliant characterization
","I remember watching this show in high school and loving it. It had brilliant characterization; for some reason, combining a cruel super-intelligent mouse with a silly free spirited mouse worked. Their non sequitur running joke, in which Brain would ask Pinky about his thoughts and time and again would find Pinky's mind had wandered far off, were priceless. Brain was mean to Pinky, but part of what made Pinky great was that he loved that, he even withstood Satan's torture. These characters could carry even the weaker story lines. It was such a silly premise, with the two mice trying to take over the world, but it was an original one, and setting the story in a dark laboratory really worked.",/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv

26 August 2004,Ginger87,," Cute And Funny
","""Pinky and the Brain"" was one of my favorite childhood cartoons. I used to watch it after ""The Anamaniacs"" on WB with my brother and sister. My favorite character was Pinky but my brother and sister's were the Brain. I think Pinky was so cute and hilarious. I also loved the theme song of this show.",/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv

24 July 2007,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,8," Good show
","I used to watch this show when I was growing up. When I think about it, I remember it very well. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things I remember very well are the opening sequence and theme song. In addition to that, everyone was ideally cast. The writing was also very strong. The performances were top-grade, too. I hope some network brings it back so I can see every episode. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I haven't seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, if some network ever brings it back, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.",/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv

30 September 2011,manigran,10," A wonderful, wonderful show
","When I was a kid, I watched Pinky and the Brain, but I didn't think much of it. It was entertaining, but it wasn't my favourite. Then, my parents got rid of cable TV, and my Pinky and the Brain days ended. Years later, a friend talked about Pinky and the Brain with me, and I decided to watch it again. As I watched the episodes online, I began to see greatness. I noticed a lot of jokes that I never picked up on when I was younger, and that was when I became a true fan.",/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2004,r-downey1,10," I loved this Show!
",When I was a kid I loved Pinky and the Brain.Everyday when I came home from school I could not wait for it to come on in the evening.The show was about two lab mice called Pinky and Brain who every night when the lab scientists had left they would come out of there cage and try to TAKE OVER THE WORLD! Warning there will be spoilers!!,/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2018,gregberne11,10," love it
","This is a spinoff from ""animaniacs"" and it is awesome, one of those few comedy shows where you can actually watch it and even enjoy it and get a few laughs instead of just loud noises and stupid jokes. but at the same time the kids will like it too.",/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 1998,Kyle Westphal,," Another brilliant cartoon that isn't just for kids.
","While kids laugh at how stupid Pinky is, the humor really goes over most kid's heads. Take ""The Pink Candidate"", an episode in which Pinky runs for president. The episodes features spoofs of Bill Clinton, Bob Dole, and James Carville. The series' Clinton slams are always hilarious. Also think, what kid would understand references to ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Ishtar"", ""Brian's Song"", ""Apocalypse Now"", Watergate, ""The Island of Dr. Monroe"", ""Chinatown"", or ""Double Indemnity""? The show also features great satire of disco and Generation X, etc. Not bad for a show about two lab mice trying to take over the world.",/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2001,jellyneckr,," Great fun!
",Steven Spielberg was an executive producer of this inventive animated series about a lab mouse that is obsessed with trying to take over the world with help from his dumb friend Pinky. PINKY AND THE BRAIN is probably one of the greatest saturday morning cartoons in history with its wacky humor and the creative plots of each episode. It's too bad it has gone off the air though.,/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2008,SimpsonsFan13,10," A Classic! What more can I say?
","This show has to be one of my personal favorites. I remember loving it when I was little. I thought it was hilarious. Pinky and the Brain made quite a hilarious duo and character conflict is what comedy is all about. Rob Paulsen and Maurice LaMarche are both excellent voice actors and they were both fantastic in this. The writing was quite clever. There was quite a bit of satire and small innuendos in the show which made it appeal on an adult level as well. Without a doubt, Pinky and the Brain was one of the funniest and most intelligent cartoons of the 90's. None of the current Saturday morning cartoons will ever be as great as Pinky and the Brain. This is right up there with The Simpsons and Futurama as one of the best cartoons ever made.",/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2010,policy134,7," Smart, funny and absolutely repetitive
","The Brain comes up with some elaborate and complicated plan to take over the world and Pinky goes: ""Narf!"". That's basically what happens in every episode of this hysterical show.",/review/rw2320917/?ref_=tt_urv
