3 November 2019,planktonrules,9," Incredibly depressing...but with some AMAZING performances and a great script.
","If you want a feel-good flick, I strongly advise you to reconsider watching ""Marriage Story"". I am NOT saying it's a bad film, in fact, it's amazingly good. But it's also amazingly realistic....and painful to watch due to the subject matter.",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2020,fearthemcneil,10," I lived a version of this movie, and it hurt.
","I didn't expect this to mirror how my ex wife and I had to go through the stages of divorce so accurately. My son was only 2 when we were divorced and all of the ups and downs and petty fights and anger that we had for each other was exhausting but we went through it all just to fight for him, who we both love more than anything. We said horrible things to each other we can never take back but we didn't really mean and we both eventually found a way to make it work for him and to protect him from the ugliness. We made it through to the other side and have a good relationship now and work as a team to raise him with love and support but it was a long road out of hell to get there. This movie portrayed that in a way I would never have expected. It made me cry numerous times thinking of how hopeless and angry I was for so long and in that I feel like this movie deserves every accolade it gets. It felt genuine and painful but with hope at the end. It's real and powerful.",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2020,TxMike,," Sadly too realistic depiction of a family going through divorce.
","Surely this must have drawn heavily from writer/director Baumbach's own experiences. He was married to Jennifer Jason Leigh and they have one son, plus before they divorced in 2013 he began a relationship with Greta Gerwig in 2011. So he probably lived much of what is depicted here.",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2019,salinaqvi,8," Some Of The Best Acting I've Ever Seen
","This movie is unequivocally carried by its stellar acting performance from its leads. Throughout the movie, you will feel the emotions of the actors and actresses on the screen and what they are going through. And the story itself does a good job at trying not to paint a black and white picture of a divorce instead making it a grey affair where both the man and the woman are in some part in fault. This is one of 2019s best acting and you need to see it just for that.",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2019,eelen-seth,10," No cheek will be left dry.
","With many directors, producers and actors blaming Netflix and other streaming services for what could end up being the end of cinema as we know, the streaming service is releasing several films in theatres for a number of weeks to be eligible for consideration during awards season. Many theatres are boycotting this strategy, so aren't playing Netflix's films at all. The theatres in mostly bigger cities around the world that do play them , are selling tickets like hotcakes. After their short theatrical run, Netflix will make their Original Film available for their members. With Marriage Story, Netflix might even get their first Best Picture award handed over to them.",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2019,CineMuseFilms,8," A witty and sad portrait of modern marriage
","It is refreshing to see a film that can both warmly respect and ruthlessly dissect the institution of marriage. While every marriage is unique, there are universal scenarios that can signal their demise. Two of these are central to Marriage Story (2019): the film forensically examines what happens when one partner's ego swallows another, then shows the destructive force that is unleashed when lawyers come between otherwise still-caring partners.",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2020,kosmasp,9," Live together, being apart or Kramer vs Kramer reboot
","The movie is brutaly honest and feels brutaly real. I don't condone everything being said or done. By neither of the two main characters. But motivations are clear and the story is really well told. The drama unfolds and it does not seem to be made up, rather really slow burning and quite reasonable (well as reasonable as some of the things can be).",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2020,matthewssilverhammer,10," ""I'll never stop loving him, even if it doesn't make sense anymore.""
","No one can hate you as strongly as someone who loves you deeply. A grown-up Baumbach gives us a Kramer vs Kramer for the 21st century, his personal best film, & the best of the 2019. Everything about it is perfection. Driver & Johansson are heartbreaking & phenomenal, though with writing this perfect, it'd be hard to imagine anyone really screwing it up. It's a perfect mixture of real & beautifully heightened, quintessential Baumbach.",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2019,ThomasDrufke,9," May Be the Best Screenplay of 2019
","Noah Baumbach's movies have often been hit or miss, but Marriage Story does feel different as it's perhaps as personal of a story as he's ever done or will do. Beautifully acted and superbly written, you can make the case that this is one of the best films of the year & may win the big prize in February. But perhaps its most impressive accomplishment was being relatable for people who've never been in a similar situation. But Baumbach's script deals with very human issues that create a film that feels like it has real stakes. It doesn't feel Hollywood-ized even though it's based on a famous Hollywood couple. Instant recommendation from me.",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2019,Martinito_08183,9," One of the best movies of 2019.
","It's hard to find words to describe why ""Marriage Story"" is amazing. Everybody already said everything the needed to be said. It was a truly powerful and emotional journey that deserves to be revisited again and again. The strongest aspects of the movie are the writing and the performances and you can say that the story has been done many times before, but it goes so deep in the way it explores the characters that i found it fascinating to watch. You understand the two main characters, since their motivations are very clear and if you going to side with one character over the other - this does not mean that the other character doesn't give some valid points.",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2019,dromasca,7," anatomy of a divorce
","'Marriage Story' directed by Noah Baumbach has been compared by many people to 'Kramer Vs. Kramer 'and I can't help suspecting that this comparison was encouraged by or even originated in the PR machine of the film's producers. There are indeed many similar traits: both films belong to the genre of 'divorce films' and have as protagonists couples who have serious reasons to break up but also maintain strong emotional bonds; in both stories there is a child at an age at which the separation of parents cannot remain without the sequels who becomes the main subject of the custody dispute and divorce settlement; lawyers play an important role in deepening the conflicts; in the lead roles in the two films appear well-known and highly talented actors who combine their magnetism (of attraction and rejection), managing to create difficult-to-forget broken couples on screens. It remains to be seen if this recipe will work with the same success at the 40-year interval that separates the release of the two films. Matching the five Academy Awards collected by 'Kramer Vs. Kramer' is a challenge.",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2019,calspers,9," A subtle and impressive study in when love comes to an end
","""Marriage Story"" (2019) written and directed by Noah Baumbach was a visceral experience. First off, this is a difficult film to master - the premise is incredibly simple, and thus, excellent writing, direction and acting is necessary in order for the film to shine - and it certainly does, in my view.",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2020,Dello_,9," Human and delicate
","""Marriage Story"" is a film about a couple which is going trough the phases of a divorce. The best thing about this movie is that the characters, the two protagonists in particular, have a very human taste and they seem like real people feeling real emotions. And thanks to the excellent performances by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson these emotions are able to touch the heart of the viewer with all their power and at the same time with a delicate taste. As far as the theme of the divorce the movie is a critic about the process of it, on how it makes the couple waste a lot of money but most importantly on the hate it creates. Indeed the protagonists starts the process with all the good intentions to split up peacefully but when the lawyers kicks in they found themselves in a fight they don't even want. And another aspect ""Marriage Story"" manages to get right is that both Charlie and Nicole had their faults and they also had been disrespected in different ways and so the movie conveys the idea that in these situations usually (not everytime) the blame is on both, maybe not equally but everyone had his faults.
""Marriage Story"" is a great movie, with excellent acting, a touching screenplay, an immersive direction and a delicate score: check this one out!",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2020,Special-K88,," believable look at marriage that's bolstered by terrific acting
","With their impending divorce on the horizon, an L.A. based former teen actress and a self-absorbed N.Y.C. based theater director confront the many cracks in their relationship, and try to recall what they once loved about each other while vying for custody of their son. Despite their attempts to settle things amicably, the reality of the situation brings some long-simmering emotions to the surface. A thoughtful mediation on marriage is beset by a few awkward moments in the script, but the up and down themes of love, family, parenthood, and all the emotional baggage that come with them are genuine, and it's acted with great conviction. Johansson and Driver both dig deep and give career-defining performances, along with a standout supporting turn from Dern as Johansson's cutthroat divorce lawyer. ***",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2019,CubsandCulture,10," A more balanced approach to a divorce story, one of the year's best
","The script makes a commitment to presenting both parents involved in the divorce responsible for both the marriage ending and the escalation within the legal system. The film works hard-in a tender realistic way-to avoid turning this into a battle of the sexes movie and the story comes across as fair *and* informed by reality. It is lacking some of the nasty MRA/Manospherean subtext that can crop up in films like this, i.e. Kramer Vs Kramer. Best of all the film has nice running sense of dry humor that really helps sell this as an authentic story. The film isn't even a dramedy but there is enough of a comedic energy present to make the tragic elements hurt all the more. The script is a tight piece of writing that is clearly been informed by lived experience.",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2019,UniqueParticle,10," Astonishing all the way through
","Well deserving of the golden globe nominations, every scene is well done! Adam Driver and Scarlet Johansson are so damn good! I enjoy Marriage Story better than most movies this year. Noah Baumbach created such a masterful experience about divorce; all the arguing is acted so spot on. Also I'd like to say this is Laura Durns best role I usually don't like her.",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2020,kevin c,8," good people at their worst
","Netflix stab at peak Woody Allen, and what a rush this film is. Funny, affecting, well-acted; a little gem. Certainly Baumbach's best work since The Squid and the Whale. Johansson and Driver both giving memorably raw and tender performances.",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2019,manuel_medeiros,9," The most genuine representation of (partly) flawed relationship I have seen

21 December 2019,CinemaClown,," A Love Story Told Through The Lens Of A Divorce
","From the director of The Squid & the Whale, Frances Ha & Mistress America comes a love story told through the lens of a divorce. Marriage Story finds Noah Baumbach taking inspirations from his own life and pouring details of the separation process he himself went through into the script, and the result is a very personal, evocative tale.",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2020,stefstars,10," Adam Driver Breaks Your Heart
","I can see why this is an award season favorite and rightfully so. Everyone does such an amazing job in this film and the story is told in a subtle yet wonderful way. You really see this couple's relationship deteriorate as the film progresses on. What I love is how they show the effect that a divorce can have on children. The mother, in this case, plays the role of a ""Sunday Father"" and buys the kid into preferring to be with her than his father. Yet you see how the little boy becomes less and less happy. It's so sad.",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2021,Sleepin_Dragon,4," Well acted, but so slow.
","I don't really see how on Earth this film has done so incredibly well, what am I missing? If there was an award for the most boring narrative, this would have run away with it.",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2020,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," Doesn't get any more realer than this
","Writer and director Noah Baumbach nailed this film, especially in the accuracy department. What made this film even more of a winner and so convincing were the perfect performances of Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, of whom I wasn't a big fan, until this performance. For that matter, even the other all-star actors were exceptional and convincing in their performances. I did however feel the 137 min runtime was way too long and the pacing could've been faster. This film needed to be trimmed down/paced faster to a max 110 mins. There was some unnecessary fluff that should've ended up on the cutting room floor, specifically the ending singing performances. Plus I would've named this film ""The Divorce Lawyer Story"". Nevertheless, it doesn't get any more realer than this.",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2019,Jared_Andrews,10," Simply Incredible (In a Beautifully Complex Way)
","The movie is called ""Marriage Story"" because it's a more appealing title than Divorce Story. But that's what the move is: the story of a divorce.",/review/rw5314009/?ref_=tt_urv
