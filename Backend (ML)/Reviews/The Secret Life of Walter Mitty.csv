","Okay, so after years of just hearing about this film and not seeing it (I have no excuses) I finally put it on. And wow, it's an absolutely fantastic film.",/review/rw2325301/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2011,Jonathon_Natsis,8," How Kelso lost his mind.
","Every so often we all seem to move away from the usual nothings we talk about amongst our friends, and instead get into a deeply philosophical conversation about the workings of Chaos Theory and the existence of parallel universes. No? Okay, just me then. In any case, this discussion just the other day led to a friend recommending The Butterfly Effect, a film that puts both a stylistic and sinister spin on the idea that even the mere flapping of a butterfly's wings can result in drastic changes in another place or time. Being initially sceptical because of the generally negative reaction from critics, I was certainly not disappointed by film's end.",/review/rw2325301/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2005,view_and_review,8," A Real Tripped Out Roller Coaster
","Man... Whew... Wow! I'm at a loss of words to describe this high octane, tantalizing, brain-stimulating movie. The acting: excellent. The plot: superb. The story: great. The drama/suspense: mind numbing.",/review/rw2325301/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2004,christian123,7," Surprisingly a great movie
","Ashton Kutcher plays Evan Treborn, a troubled man who suffered blackouts as a child. When he discovers a way to travel back into the body of his past self, his time trips start to cause negative results on his present. As he uses his powers to try to fix his past and present, the effect escalates, creating alternate realities, many of which are worse than the past that he is trying to change.",/review/rw2325301/?ref_=tt_urv

","What if you could go back to major junctions in your life and take the other path? What if there's an alternate life for you somewhere, out there, where the cumulative sum of your choices leads to a better reality, a happier and more fulfilling existence?

2 August 2008,desire_911,9," Outstanding !
","First of all, a fair warning to EVERYONE... this movie is NOT for all audiences. The ""R"" rating was very well earned in this one; you'll be thinking about how seriously twisted the movie dares to go LONG after you leave.",/review/rw2325301/?ref_=tt_urv

27 July 2012,kowloonzai,8," Mindf@ck film just like they should be
","I seldom come out and write movie reviews in IMDb but I felt this one deserved some effort from me. I don't recall any movie which made me shiver thinking about what was gonna come next when I hit pause to go for a pee or any other reason. This one is really something. There is a ""Lost Highway"" feel to it and the themes are closely related but...The Butterfly effect is in fact more complex.It is a really disturbing movie, not so much for what it shows, but for what it keeps you guessing - like all true thriller masterpieces - , about events that take or might take place, and above all, about human sanity and the subtle twist there is between the average Joe's walk of life and outright perversion. Requires multiple - rewarding - viewings.",/review/rw2325301/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2005,Mappyman,9," Change one thing. Change everything
","Evan has always suffered from something that causes him to ""blackout"" during times of extreme crisis. All through his childhood he would blank out right before something drastic happens and not remember anything that happened. Now in college, he reads through a journal he used to write as a kid to notice that all of a sudden these harmful memories are coming back to him. When he goes to ask his childhood sweetheart about it she doesn't want to talk about it. He finds out however, that he can actually tap into his past and change what happened in these events. Unfortunately, every time he changes the past, even in the slightest way the future is also effected. ",/review/rw2325301/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2005,mjw2305,8," One of the best movies i saw in 2004

23 May 2011,drpakmanrains,10," Incredibly Great Film
","With over 1000 reviews, chances are not many are going to read this, but I just have to say how much I love this film, which I just discovered about a month ago, and have now watched 7 times, once the theatrical version and six times, the directors version, which I greatly prefer, as it fits the overall script better and what was intended originally. I am 70, and hardly expected this or any new movie to make it to my top 10, especially since I am not a fan of fantasy or time travel movies generally, but ""The Butterfly Effect"" has become my 4th favorite of the nearly 3000 films I have viewed in my life. The movie has many disturbing scenes, but the pace is amazingly fast, the acting excellent for the most part, and the characters physical continuity from childhood through adolescence to adult was the best I have ever seen in a film with 3 separate periods. The plot has been so thoroughly reviewed, I won't waste time telling the details again. Suffice it to say, if you can handle the elements of child abuse and animal mistreatment, (not graphically depicted) and can ignore the critics and watch the film at least twice, I think you will appreciate what a great film this is. And I have recently watched the director's commentary and deleted scenes, which further illustrate what an ambitious film this is. It should have been a classic, and it shows how off-base the critic's fraternity can be. Roger Ebert was fairer to the film than most of the others among major critics, but I think they were determined to knock the film because they didn't like Ashton Kutcher, and the film came out in January, which predisposes most critics to expect a bomb. Do yourself a favor if interested, and rent this Infinifilm. If you like an intense and entertaining movie experience, you won't be disappointed, and you may be enthralled, as I was, and hope you will be.",/review/rw2325301/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2005,daugaard4,10," See it more than once!
","The film has never been showed in Denmark, (where I come from) so the press has never reviewed it. It took me 2 times to get the point but when I realized every part of the film, I felt a huge rush! I'm sure when I see it the 3rd time it will be an even bigger experience to me. Every part of the film plays an important role to the main thread. Every details have a role! The film is like reading a poem from the 18th century, where every sentence means something. The director is a pure genius! Those who've criticized the film, should really see it again, because you'll then notice all the details which makes this film excellent! Without a doubt one of the best films I've seen!",/review/rw2325301/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2007,fandago2003,10," Buy the Director's Cut and watch ONLY this version
","OK it's a bit to late to write a comment about this movie but let me tell you about it. Don't by any means watch the theatrical version!!! The first time I watched the movie was when I rented the Director's cut version. I was fascinated, really stunned by this movie. It kept me wondering why I haven't heard of that movie before and the answer was that people didn't see the Director's cut but the Theatrical version instead. Oh yes there are no similarities between those versions. The theatrical version is a light version if you like, a version at the end of which you will say ""well OK nice movie"", but(!!!!) the Director's cut gives the real meaning of the movie. It changes the whole idea, it adds new scenes and omits others, it changes the whole movie with a new outstanding ending and the plot in general is more concrete!!! I won't say anymore so jump to the Director's cut at once and if by any chance the TV broadcasts the theatrical version just change the channel!!!",/review/rw2325301/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2004,doner_morferelli,," Haunting, Tragic, but ultimately Brilliant
","I have seen this movie just a few hours ago and i have to say that it is brilliantly conceived. Definately not a feel good film, but rather dark and tragic in every sense of the word. Yes the performances were above and beyond etc etc... and it helped, but the film itself is an emotionally provacative piece of work that had me feeling sad, morose and depressed. Nonetheless i think that this makes it a very powerful film to evoke such strong feelings while watching it. It is, for lack of a better term, very human. On a different note there were also many complexities to do with chaos theory inderlying the raw emotional turmoil that the characters endure such as time travel, alternate universes and such, but rather than rely on these interesting ideas and theories to carry the movie, it is instead simply used as a background setting for an incredible story. I loved it for what it is, but not something you see to be entertained. See this movie but don't take your family.",/review/rw2325301/?ref_=tt_urv

3 April 2004,vertigo_14,4," It should've been called-how to be excruciatingly stereotypical.
","I was rather surprised with this movie, not expecting much from something with Ashton Kutcher in the lead. I just can't seem to him picture with him any kind of real acting ability.

8 March 2011,Leofwine_draca,7," Time travel for the masses
","Time travel movies are notoriously difficult to get right, and they tend to work best when the time travel elements are kept simple (think of movies like THE TERMINATOR and TIMECOP, in which the sci-fi stuff is just an excuse to get to the action). THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT jumps right into the deep end by tackling the subject matter head on, and it turns out to make a surprisingly successful job of it.",/review/rw2325301/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2007,fedor8,," The unintentional hilarity saves this junk from the lowest rating.
","First of all, I haven't laughed during a ""thriller"", much less a ""sci-fi thriller"", this much in years. They should have called the film ""Those Damn Vibrating Letters"". Or perhaps ""Comedy Of Errors"", because whichever new reality Ashton creates - it turns into a complete disaster, either for him, for someone else, or for everybody in his life. I can see Laurel & Hardy in Ashton's role, screwing up one time after another  in a zany slapstick comedy. But Ashton in this role, and in a THRILLER?! I think not.",/review/rw2325301/?ref_=tt_urv

","I should have written about this film the first time I watched it. Now it's been the third time and although I loved it as much as the first time, my head has added up lots of things and I can't say something straight. What I'll do, is try to summarize all my thoughts in some paragraphs. I'm just going to say one main thing, because there were bad reviews and lots of opinions; this is a great film.

13 August 2004,claudio_carvalho,9," Excellent, Unpredictable and Intriguing Screenplay  A Must- See Film
","Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher when adult) blacks out painful memories since he was a kid. Although being the beloved son of Andrea Treborn (Melora Walters), he misses the presence of his father, who is an intern of an institution for the mentally ill. His best friends are Kayleigh and her brother Tommy, and Lenny. When Evan is about seven years old, he is advised by his doctor to write a journal, as a kind of memory exercise. When he is about twenty years old, he decides to read his notes, and realizes that he can travel in time and change his past. However, when he does it, the reality in the present changes too much, affecting the lives of his mother and friends. Evan tries to improve their lives, but he realizes that he is not God. This movie is presently in the movie theaters of Rio de Janeiro, but yesterday I rented an imported DVD. I saw the `Theatrical Version', and I found an excellent, unpredictable and intriguing screenplay. The story hooks the attention until the last scene, and it is amazing the great dramatic performance of Ashton Kutcher, since I am used to see him in comedies (`Dude, Where is My Car?', `Just Married', `My Boss Daughter' etc.). I saw also the deleted scenes, with the `Stalker Ending' and `Happy Sappy Ending' (which I liked more). This weekend, I intend to see the `Director's Cut Version'. I highly recommend this film. My vote is nine.",/review/rw2325301/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ashton Kutcher isn't generally regarded as being synonymous with great movie-making (I can appreciate that not everyone loves 'Dude, Where's My Car?' as much as I do), but if there's one title in his filmography that genuinely excuses the guy for his endless forgettable roles in crap rom-coms, it's gotta be The Butterfly Effect—the dude puts in a sweet performance!",/review/rw2325301/?ref_=tt_urv
