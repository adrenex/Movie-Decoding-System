8 September 2022,benjaminskylerhill,2," Takes all the wrong notes from the classic original
","Robert Zemeckis is a filmmaker responsible for some of the most colorful, ambitious, and uniquely fanciful films of all time. While his Pinocchio remake is certainly not entirely without its effective moments of visual splendor, it pains me to say that he has continued the trend of live-action Disney remakes that somehow manage to take everything about the original and make it significantly worse.",/review/rw8575082/?ref_=tt_urv

8 September 2022,IonicBreezeMachine,4," Narratively, emotionally, and thematically hollow, Pinocchio may be the weakest Disney live-action remake I've seen yet.
","In a small village, a lonely woodworker named Geppetto (Tom Hanks) makes a wish upon a star for his wooden puppet to be a real boy. A kind Blue Fairy (Cynthia Erivo) answers his wish and gives life to Pinocchio (Benjamin Evan Ainsworth) but says to him if he wishes to be a real boy he'll have to do it himself by proving himself truthful, unselfish, and brave. A cricket named Jiminy Cricket (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is assigned by the Blue Fairy to be Pinocchio's conscience with the approval of the Blue Fairy, and Geppetto is ecstatic to find his wish has come true. It isn't long before Pinocchio while good natured does eventually find himself drawn to the allure of taking shortcuts and partaking in vices while Jiminy tries to keep him on the right track. While Pinocchio is drawn into a world of sinister characters, Jiminy tries to keep him on the straight and narrow. Geppetto sets off to find Pinocchio and eventually Pinocchio must try to rescue his father.",/review/rw8575082/?ref_=tt_urv

8 September 2022,TheMysteriousReviewer,4," Worst Disney Remake (so far)
","I'm gonna be honest, I do try my best to tolerate most of the live action remakes. We only got Jungle Book as the only one worth watching, everything else are either decent or just okay. Now the movie is released, I can already see a good reason people will debate this and the 2019 Lion King. The 2022 Pinocchio remake may not be the worst Disney Plus film, but this could be the worst live action Disney remake to date. There are Pinocchio movies out there that do try to find a way to tell the story of the character well. But this is more of a recycled film from the original 1940 one. Despite it does have some of the performances that's fateful to the original film, it had a weak execution with a poorly written story, mediocre characters, overly dark setups, and awful looking visuals. The one thing I'll say the visuals got right is with Pinocchio himself. But for the most part, they can be out of place and most of the designs try way too hard to make animal characters realistic. I mean, we already gotten Ugly Sonic in Chip and Dale. What more do you want to do all that in, Disney Plus? Of course as a painfully pointless live action Disney remake, I recommend to skip this one and stick with the original film. But you know what, let's all be thankful at least we're getting the one by Del Toro at the end of the year. When that gets released, I can guarantee it will be the one you'd want to watch instead. I think Disney should take a break from remaking their classic animated films before they embarrass themselves the more that are made.",/review/rw8575082/?ref_=tt_urv

10 September 2022,jegd-847-631407,3," Soulless
","A 3.5 rating... The one thing that I sat through the entirety of this film was to see the whale again. Monstro was the gigantic man-eating sperm whale, and the fourth and final antagonist of Disney's 1940 animated feature Pinocchio. I remember it very well. That beast was shelved in favor of a thing bearing tentacles. I groaned aloud, but kept my eyes focused for the final outcome; Pinocchio becoming a real boy was the famous ending of many generations of children. Robert Zemeckis denied us even that. The story stops as the characters walk away from the beach. I fear this was purposeful for sake of a sequel, but I can't imagine even Disney overlooking the audience's reaction. This was not joyful or entertaining. Even Tom Hanks seemed dead-eyed in his role, almost robotic in nature. There was no charm there.",/review/rw8575082/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,Leofwine_draca,4," Bland
","Yet another live action adaptation from Disney of one of their beloved cartoon classics. You wonder why they bothered in this instance when most of the characters are CGI anyway with the exception of Tom Hanks, seriously miscast as the eccentric inventor. As usual with these modern-day Disney productions, this is a bland and soulless affair that goes through the motions without ever engaging the senses. It's not quite as long as some of these remakes can be, thankfully, but it fails to stir the senses in every respect and I find it quite telling that the CGI Pinnocchio has less humanity in his eyes than the old animated version.",/review/rw8575082/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,eprissel,1," This is the worst of all the remakes.
","Pinocchio repeats so many of the issues of the other awful remakes (just a rehash, shot for shot redo of the original with barely anything new and what they do change is made worse and questionable), but also suffers from god awful effects (150 million dollars to effects from 2004), a cast that is either bored (Cynthia Erivo and Luke evans) or just bad imitations (Tom hanks and Joseph Gordon-levitt), an insult of an ending (the whole point of the story being that Pinocchio himself becomes brave and sacrifices himself and then becomes a real boy, all of that is completely cut for an ambiguous ending that fails due to an abrupt feeling and bad narration from jimminy that felt like he didn't want to say it so he just got it over with as soon as possible), awful jokes that don't fit, and Robert zemekis thinking he is impressing us when really he is just self indulgent with his bad filmmaking. If I wished a star, I wished Disney stopped making these remakes because they just keep getting worse, and this to me is the bottom of that already crap laced barrel.",/review/rw8575082/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,sebastianali123,3," Like always, the modern generations have the fault.
","Like any other Disney remake (except perhaps arguably Beauty and The Beast), a disaster that does not respect the essence of the original in the slightest, and of all the remakes, this is probably the worst alongside Dumbo and The Lion King. The Uncanny Valley effect whipping through the roof, unnecessary filler and replacement of iconic situations, flanderized characters and dark situations made more ""light"", two new characters horribly generic and without any charm, old characters without charm, the fairy inexplicably changed and references to the popular culture at a time when it would make no sense.",/review/rw8575082/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,ryanward-45039,3," Another disgraceful Disney remake!
","This is absolutely another bad Disney remake. It's also bad as The Lion King, Beauty And The Beast, Mulan and even the Aladdin remakes. The characters here aren't as memorable and lovable. I even found Tom Hanks as Geppetto as pretty much him trying to sentimental in a certain way towards this literal CGI puppet that is Pinocchio. The villains here who are less scary in this one, but also kinda boring. Like what I said I wasn't huge fan of the live action Disney remakes, but this one isn't really the worse, it's just not that good.",/review/rw8575082/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,TechnicJunglist,3," Unnecessary, ridiculous, and annoying.
","The original Pinocchio scares me to death, given the themes (Pleasure Island oof, Pinocchio threatened to be burned alive, the coachman alluding to 'when they come back they aint boys no more'), even as an adult but boy does it have some of the most beautiful cell hand painted animation I've ever seen. Why is Monstro Lovecraftian? Pinocchio is a selfish block of wood. This production is heartless and a money grab. The voice acting is shrill to the point i turned the sound way down and put the captions on. Tom Hanks is better than this. I'll wait for Guillermo's darker version. 3 stars for Figaro because I'm a cat owner.",/review/rw8575082/?ref_=tt_urv

","Why? Why does Disney continue to do this? You would think after how many of their live action films have been disasters from The Lion King to Beauty and the Beast that maybe they'd learn these remakes aren't needed. They all try to recapture the magic and feeling of their original counterparts, but fail to do so.

28 September 2022,kyle-stauffer21,," I was very disappointed that there's not an option for a negative star rating.
","Where do you even begin? You have to wonder why some Disney exec hasn't come right out and said the quiet part out loud, that they are on a quest to destroy everything that was great about Disney and completely make that legacy unrecognizable. Pinocchio doesn't seem to be an active participant in the movie he's more a victim of circumstance. He doesn't make any decisions, he's just kind of along for the ride and he really didn't have to suffer any consequences for choices. The original movie actually taught kids something valuable, and in this one they've watered down every single one of those elements. Apparently the lesson that they want to teach kids in this one is that there is no personal responsibility there's always somebody else to blame. Lying is no longer something that is to be avoided if it can be used as a superpower to get you your own way and it's a benefit to you. What an absolute disappointment.",/review/rw8575082/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2022,PlutoZoo,2," Boy, what a wooden remake.
","I wonder what the point is of remaking beloved animated movies in a real motion sense whilst altering so much of the charm and magic of the original. It just seems like a desperate bid to be all things to everyone whilst gouging out the spirit of the thing. In this effort, Pinnochio has awoken to, well ... a world of woke! The changes in this respect seems like more virtuous signals from the giant corporation, and we get it, we should be inclusive, but please do it in new stories, not by altering classic fairy tales to achieve this. It is just madness in my opinion. The results speak for themselves and despite a great performance by Honest John, the rest, including Tom Hanks, must be wondering if they achieved what they signed up for. The answer is no. The film ends with a rather puerile and nauseating conclusion and it seems to have been decided that it was a step too far to change this wooden boy into a real boy. Overall, it's essentially a horrible remake, seemingly churned out to satisfy the need for content on the streaming service.",/review/rw8575082/?ref_=tt_urv

","First, this movie is was way too long for children. Second, I didn't appreciate the morality lessons the way they were being pushed. Why would I want my children saying ""what the cuss?"" The boy who took him to Pleasure Island sounded like a stereotypical gangster. Why would this be desirable for children? At least I assume the ethnic-bashing is probably over their heads. Nothing here is for children. Too dark and hard to see. Watch the original, the classic again and listen to classic soundtrack. Mostly same songs but not as well done as the original.
