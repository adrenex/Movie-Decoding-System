29 September 2022,comcockbot,5," Insightful yet deeply flawed
",Blaze could have been so great. The concept sounds fantastic and Savage is doing a great job as the main. Most of the coming of age parts are actually really well done and the movie portrays the process of trauma management in a way that feels relatable.,/review/rw8683627/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2022,MK_Ultra_,9," Unique, surreal, imaginative.
","The premise is one of how you interpret the visualization. To state too much of what it is about starts off the film and would be spoilers, so let's leave it at a young teen girl that stumbles upon a very traumatic situation that she isn't fully capable of understanding and how she compartmentalizes this event. The director uses surreal art quality scenes to show there was earlier trauma within the family dynamic that brought along her ability to deal with things by letting her mind go to an ""otherwordly"" head space. These scenes of where she takes her mind might not be for every viewer ability to grasp but that's what makes this unique. Reminiscent of another film from a couple of years ago, ""I Kill Giants"" which I also enjoyed because it showed another angle, grief from losing a mother ro cancer and how it was also dealt with internally, through the eyes and mind of a young girl.",/review/rw8683627/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2022,arthur_tafero,5," More Like a Toaster Oven - Blaze
","This film was potentially an interesting premise; unfortunately, there are too many flaws in the production to produce a Blaze. The film is more of a toaster-oven. The gradual psychological recovery of a young girl who witnesses a violent act probably takes place thousands of times a year in the US, so there is really nothing unique here. An examination of the adults and their characters might have been helpful, but those are missing from the film. The performance of the young girl playing Blaze is fine, and I am sure she has a future in film. The same cannot be said for the writers of the film, however.",/review/rw8683627/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2022,themightykazoo-30763,2," It's hilarious. One of the best unintentional comedies
",This movie owes me several beers as I spit up several times while watching. Unintentionally hilarious. I have nothing good to say about it.,/review/rw8683627/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2022,bigcced-928-942329,4," Weird, Boring.
",It's like French people on drugs made a movie. Good quality. Good acting. Poor script.,/review/rw8683627/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,carly-southern,6," Creative and Brilliant in Many Ways... except the rape scene
",There's many ongoing conversations about rape/violence being depicted in film.,/review/rw8683627/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2022,osbornkirkee,1," Time wasting
",Honestly it's a bore and pain to watch this movie. It literally is juz time wasting. Who even directed this movie. It looked like a 2022 sub part teletubby movie with a pinch amusement park colors. I watched this movie because it was above 5.0 in rating. Pls next time add P 1 year old to it. This looks like a movie for a 1 year old baby that doesn't understand anything and is thrilled by visuals and colors. It's truly time wasting to watch a movie like this in 2022. I will recommend it to those finding it difficult to sleep since it will do the job of making you sleep very well as well as get you confused and angry at the same time.,/review/rw8683627/?ref_=tt_urv
