29 September 2021,TxMike,," Small movie, young boy wants to help save his mother.
","Our society has become so negative. Just read a few of the reviews that knock this movie, many of them don't actually say anything they just want to prevent others from seeing it. Why? That is so non-productive.",/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2021,joiningjt,10," It just shows how NEGATIVE this country has become!! This is a beautiful film!!!
","Let's start with the acting, absolutely fantastic very likeable characters especially the 2 young leads. The story was predictable but that's Underrated if its predictable and has a happy outcome sometimes that's what we need. Sometimes I love a simple story done beautifully and shot in a beautiful setting. It's so sad that people have become so NEGATIVE that they give a beautiful film like this a 1. Sad!! If you have a family and want to watch a beautiful film its EXTREMELY family friendly. My wife and I saw this together just now and we both have great big smiles...",/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv

7 September 2021,rphanley,6," Ignore the negative reviews.
",This was a good movie with a good message. It's geared for a younger/family audience but that's not a bad thing. The movie has a point at the end of it and that's better than most movies these days. Worth watching in my opinion.,/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2021,Tweekums,8," A delightful family film with mild scares
","Gunner Boone is a boy living in the Pacific North West; his mother is suffering from leukaemia and he would do anything to save her. His family is fairly new to the town and it isn't long before he hears the legend of 'The Water Man'; an old miner who gained immortality after discovering a strange stone just before a flood washed away the town... now he is rumoured to spend his time searching the forests for his lost wife. Gunner hear a girl named Jo telling a story of how she crossed paths with the Water Man and has the scar to prove it. She offers to take Gunner to him, for a price. They head into the forest together and soon Gunner's father realises he is missing; the sense of urgency increases when a forest fire is reported.",/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2021,DogePelis2015,6," The Water Man
",It's a new family movie on Netflix; the plot is decent and the performances are passable; David Oyelowo has a lot of potential as a new film director.,/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2021,kjell-ahlstrom,4," It lacks the magic
","This is my kind of movie. Child escapism movies mixing with fantasy is where my heart is. I will re-watch The Neverending Story, Mio in the Land of Faraway and Bridge To Terabithia any day of the week. I hold those movies in my top 10 of the best movies ever made.",/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2021,nogodnomasters,7," Give me all your money
",Young Gunner (Lonnie Chavis) reads detective stories and write graphic novels. His father (David Oyelowo) is strict and his mother (Rosario Dawson) is terminally ill. Gunner wants to help his mother. He discovers a local legend about the Water Man who survived a flood because of a magical stone that has regeneration powers. Josephine (Amiah Miller) has seen the Water Man and knows where to find him. They go on a trip into the forest which seems almost magical.,/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2021,susanmstrasser,8," Pretty Good Family Movie
","We have two children, ages 7 and 11, and am always looking for PG (not PG-13) rated family movies.",/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2021,trimblair,1," So slow

20 June 2021,wisemanfromtowne,2," The Waterman....a very dry film.
","A very annoying young boy with a vivid imagination, his sick mother, his father who had somewhat zero patience with him (can't say that I blame him) and his the white girlfriend (literal friend and nothing more) abused by her dad and the quest for the waterman to save his sick mother. Gunner (the young boy) got on my damn nerve the entire film with all his whining and crying and being nerdy, that his role took away from his quest of finding the waterman. No boldness, no confidence ever displayed or acquired and it was annoying. Dude never grew a pair for the whole duration film. I think with a better character than Gunner, the film would have been more enjoyable.",/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2021,Booboboo,6," Simple, straightforward kids movie
","This is basically a Disney-like story with a dying parent, an innocent child on a quest, and a strong morale towards the end. People here are harsh in their reviews, but it's a nice sunday night movie for 8 year olds. My kids weren't too bothered by the slight plot holes, but liked the adventure, the idea of the water man and what he turns out to be.",/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2021,catsie-59129,3," Not Worth Seeing
","Some tension, but very little actual excitement. Feels like the script was written by an AI who was made to read a bunch of thriller and family-friendly movie scripts then write its own without being told the difference between the two genres. The climax and resolution are disappointing and confusing.",/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2021,yusufpiskin,2," And... Oprah again!
","I don't know which is weirder, Oprah Winfrey still making movies like this? Or is it that this movie won an award in Toronto? Someone remind Oprah we're in 2021.",/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv

4 September 2021,jeroduptown,6," Little Filtration Needed
","Though it's a little murky towards the end, The Water Man tackles a hard subject (death) from a young man's perspective. On a quest for hope and a cure for his mom, he searches out the truth of The Water Man legend.",/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2021,stevebondi,5," Some heartfelt moments, but not worth the watch :-(
","Despite a very likable main character, the writing and execution were just too weak to make an entertaining movie :-(",/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2021,ydelle-95674,8," What the low rating???
",I don't know why the ratings are so low. In these times we need a diversion. The boy from This is us was very good. This is a story of love-friendship and hope.,/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2021,tom-28341,1," I wanted to like this movie...

26 September 2021,isaacochoterena,7," Well balanced
",In this film the story develops a reflection on how we see death and what we think when we know that someone important to us is going to die.,/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2022,sc00tz,1," Stupid movie. Stupid ending. Stupid waste of time.
","Don't waste your time unless you like watching kids endanger their lives going on an ""adventure"" only to come out empty-handed. In the end it was all for nothing.",/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2021,yankeedoo,2," sounded ok-was not

11 July 2021,shelby-858-266850,8," Why the bad reviews?
","I can only guess that the bad reviews were left by people with no imagination. It's a movie about hope and love with a little adventure thrown in. It's not that difficult people, what's not to ""get"" ?",/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2021,siderite,6," Could have been better
","This is a story about a boy trying to find a magical cure for his mother's illness. It's not a fantastical film, it's just about how he grows to understand what the situation is and come to terms with it. Is it terribly captivating? Not really. It is emotional, but not greatly so. It is with children, but they are not particularly cute or intelligent or interesting. I think it will click a lot with people who have lost someone dear or who live with sickness in the family, but it's not that accessible to others.",/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2021,ops-52535,6," a wishing well that doesnt quite deliver...
","Even though it has its moments of magic and adventour to make a grumpy oldtory to the end. Its not hereby said that it is a gold nugget, rather a piece of obsidian of nno further value for the real squemmish. The idea is great but its a mixed experience considering acting quality and the way its stiched together, and looses a lot of its credibility and coherence when closing up to the end.",/review/rw7219987/?ref_=tt_urv
