21 August 2001,Infofreak,," Superb adaptation!
","I'm always dubious when books I love are made into movies. They never QUITE translate and something is always lost. The idea of filming 'Naked Lunch' is even more difficult than usual, because it isn't really a novel with a coherent, chronological narrative, more a sequence of surreal, absurdly dark and funny ""skits"". As such it would be impossible to make a successful movie out of the raw material Burroughs created. Luckily Cronenberg (and who would have been better equipped to make this?) has cannily blended scenes from the book with incidents inspired by William Burroughs real life, and made it work. Very well. ",/review/rw6735838/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 1999,gtran,," Introduction to the New Flesh
","Movies in the last years have become more uniform, more streamlined, particularly in the US. As a result, the film market is full of sleek, entertaining movies that the whole world goes to see, but these movies have nothing but harmless baby teeth. Fortunately, people like Lynch or Cronenberg still do movies that may be considered defective by most people, but that bite into the flesh with pointy canines. The Naked Lunch has very sharp teeth indeed. It's supposed to be an adaptation from a William Burrough's book, which doesn't make sense anyway. It starts as the story of a failed writer whose wife becomes addicted to an insecticide powder... It goes downhill after this relatively sane and normal beginning. It's a ride, a drug-induced nightmare full of horribly funny visions (the sort of visions that artists used centuries ago to represent hell). Anuses talk. Aliens sip alcohol in bars. People get impaled. Typewriters turn into bugs. Liquids ooze. You may say it's flawed, or disgusting, or ridiculous, or boring. I saw it with someone who absolutely hated it. But the fact that this person still keeps talking about it 8 years after seeing it says a lot about the Naked Lunch, at a time when we tend to forget blockbusters a few hours after watching them. The Naked Lunch is here - in your mind - to stay.",/review/rw6735838/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2003,hohumdedum2,10," Twisted Film concerning twisted minds
","Naked Lunch seems to be just totally incomprehensible upon first viewing. However, after watching it again, you start to understand more and more. Upon multiple viewings, you really get a feel for what's transpiring before your eyes.  The ultimate message is that it is really just a metaphor for heroin addiction, even though it's so much more deeper than that.  It's an intricate study of a man, William S. Burroughs, who was a heroin addict, and among other things one of the most significant Beat authors ever.  The film delves deeply into the psyche of Burroughs and takes you on a trip in his mind and your own.  There are touches of reality and many flashes of paranoia, and it is all done with style and grace.  Seriously one of the best films about an author, Naked Lunch will certainly stand the test of time against other films which may seem at first entertaining, but lose their luster upon multiple viewings.  Whereas, Naked Lunch, in my opinion, never will.  10 out of 10.",/review/rw6735838/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 1999,Philby-3,," a bug's eye view of the creative process
","Films about writers and the creative process are not generally action-packed, but this unusual piece has plenty of incident. The action takes place largely inside the mind of  ""William Lee"" (William S. Burroughs) whose first book ""Junkie: Confessions of an Unredeemed Drug Addict"" dealt with his struggle against heroin addiction. ""The Naked Lunch"", set in the early 1950s, could be described as telling how that book came to be written. Lee does it tough. After ""drying out"" he has a job as a pest exterminator, killing cockroaches with powder from a cannister. He discovers that his wife Joan, still an addict, is shooting up with the bug powder and having sex openly with two of his literary friends, Hank and Martin. He then manages to kill her accidentally with his pistol (""I guess it's about time for our William Tell routine""). He flees the country and washes up in ""Interzone"" (Tangier - then an ""international"" city).",/review/rw6735838/?ref_=tt_urv

Bill finds out that his wife Joan (Judy Davis) is taking it & injecting herself with it, then strangely Bill is contacted by a large bug type creature that informs Bill he has to kill his wife Joan because she is an enemy agent.

13 January 2011,moonspinner55,4," ""I feel very insecure without a typewriter in the house...""
","Not for all tastes. Writer-director David Cronenberg's appropriately-loose adaptation of William S. Burroughs' cult 1959 novel--his script inspired more by Burroughs' life than by his literature--this tale of a drug-addicted exterminator lost among perverted American expatriates in Tangier is satisfyingly grotesque for about an hour. Counseled (or rather, egged on) by demonic talking roaches, the exterminator takes to writing a book after accidentally killing his wife; fleeing New York City, he meets by chance his dead spouse's lookalike and her husband, a quietly menacing homosexual with a typewriter fetish. Not particularly well-made, though Cronenberg certainly gained the trust of his actors and succeeds in not making them look foolish. Begins intriguingly but gradually loses steam, the shock factor having worn off. Judy Davis connects with the audience in an extraordinarily immediate way, but Peter Weller is too laconic to carry the rest of the weight. *1/2 from ****",/review/rw6735838/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was another film that I checked out as part of the best horror films of the 1990's. Now I wouldn't necessarily say this is horror, but it is definitely horrific. I was really intrigued about this one as a co-worker told me how good it was and I'm a big fan of the writer/director David Cronenberg.

1 July 2015,JosephPezzuto,7," Reel Look: Naked Lunch
","""Exterminate all rational thought. That is the conclusion I have come to."" A product of the Beat Poetry generation, writer and drug addict William S. Burroughs' 1959 Naked Lunch novel's title takes it's name as described best by the author: ""a frozen moment when everyone sees what is on the end of every fork"". The book was notably banned in many places and deemed unfilmable until Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg (Videodrome, The Fly) took the project into his own hands in 1991, adapting from Burroughs' other works as well to tell the story of this surreally strange science-fiction drama. Combining Howard Shore, known for his thunderous choir and full orchestra scores and Ornette Coleman's dizzy saxophone of free jazz together for the film's astounding score was certainly an audacious choice, as the notes sporadically swell and sway, seeming to add a hazy atmosphere to the drug-fueled ambiance of the picture. Peter Suschitzky's queasy green-and-gray-tinged cinematography only adds to the collision of varying sensibilities of a sickly uneasiness as well throughout. Did Cronenberg succeed at filming the unfilmable? Let's take a look. ",/review/rw6735838/?ref_=tt_urv

","Most of you probably know that ""Naked Lunch"" is not about unclothed people eating a midday meal. It's an understatement to say that the movie is about drug addiction. Based on William S. Burroughs' autobiographical novel, exterminator Bill Lee (Peter Weller) gets addicted to the substance that he uses to kill bugs. After accidentally killing his wife, Bill ventures to Tangiers, Morocco, where he gets involved with a group of people in the international zone (or ""Interzone""). In the process, of course, there are many over-sized bugs with whom he carries on conversations. The movie gets progressively weirder and weirder.",/review/rw6735838/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2020,christopher-underwood,6," I just wish I could have been more on board
","In common with the writings of Burroughs this is innovative, inspiring and yet difficult. Difficult both to relate to and to fully sympathise, never mind the narrative flow that may or may not be there. I have to say the picture quality on my Blu-ray was stunning and once I had managed to remove the German subtitles as much a joy to watch as it was to listen to the wonderful soundtrack. It is just that this is so very strange and uncompromising in its celebration of homosexuality and drug taking that it can be an effort to stay with it. it was just about the only Cronenberg I had not seen and it was interesting to see, instead of machines and mechanisms merging into man, this was the other way around with machines becoming squishy. The animatronics were impressive and although the final set piece didn't work so well, the whole thing was well managed and I just wish I could have been more on board.",/review/rw6735838/?ref_=tt_urv
