16 October 2002,LebowskiT1000,8," Who would have thought a film about Poker would be so good?
","There is a lot of good stuff in this film.  You have a great story, an excellent cast, excellent directing, and a couple great games of poker.",/review/rw7127597/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2000,TxMike,," I really enjoyed this movie, more than I thought I would.
","I knew ""Rounders"" had something to do with gambling, and that Matt Damon stars in it, but not much more. So, when I watched it on DVD I was pleasantly surprised how engaging a film it is.",/review/rw7127597/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2005,baumer,10," One of the most under rated films ever!
","Rounders is nothing short of hypnotic. It is a film that introduced me and many others to the surreal world of poker. High stakes, Texas Hold Em, winner take all poker. For those unfamiliar with the game, not only is this a perfect tutorial to understand the game, but this is a movie that will entertain you right to the very end.",/review/rw7127597/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2001,pae-sk,," The Son of the Cincinnati Kid Rides Again!
","I love this movie: the plot line is pat and predictable as it effortlessly unfolds; the characters are clearly defined and you know who to root for and who to despise; and there are no dull scenes or dead end sub-plots. Matt Damon is Mike, an affable law student with little interest in the law and a passion for high stakes poker.  When he loses his shirt and promises his girl friend (cute and perky Gretchen Mol) that he will never play poker again, you know this pie-crust promise will quickly be broken.  And broken it is when Matt picks up his former schoolmate buddy, ""Worm"" (Edward Norton) who is getting out of prison and leads him back to the poker table and deep, deep into debt and hot water.",/review/rw7127597/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2005,MovieAddict2016,8," Very underrated character piece, although not without its flaws
","""Rounders"" is about a straight-flying legal student (Matt Damon) who leaves behind his gambling habits to satisfy his moralistic girlfriend. However when his best friend ""Worm"" (Edward Norton) is released from jail, the two embark on a cards-journey that leads them from success to misfortune after Worm is caught cheating and the man who caught him (John Malkovich) wants his money back.",/review/rw7127597/?ref_=tt_urv

4 September 2008,bkoganbing,9," You Read The Opponent, Not The Cards
","Rounders is a story of a pair of prep school buddies, Matt Damon and Edward Norton, who are a pair of poker sharks. Damon's used his winnings to pay for law school and Norton's gone on to other enterprises like identity theft which has landed him a stretch in prison.",/review/rw7127597/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 1999,Paul-103,7," Interesting story, great acting
","Have to first mention the great performances by Matt Damon, Edward Norton, John Malkovich, and Martin Landeau.  Good story, although Worm was one the biggest jerks I've seen interpreted on film lately.  Really liked the narration of what's going on during high stakes poker matches.  Talked to poker playing people who thought the game was represented well.  The one-on-ones between Damon and Malkovich were terrific.",/review/rw7127597/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2001,hbs,8," excellent movie
","I have no idea if this movie is at all realistic (certainly so many people inhabiting this strata of the poker world can be so good looking), but at least it has the ring of verisimilitude. Not only does it show us the workings of a somewhat exotic (to me, anyway) part of the world, but it manages to do this stylishly while treating us to an interesting character study and a clever plot.",/review/rw7127597/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2007,ccthemovieman-1,5," Good Movie For Poker Fans
","If you like poker - and more and more people seem to be playing it or watching it on TV - you might want to check out this movie. Although a fictional story, you get some good insights on the game, the how and whys.",/review/rw7127597/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2002,bob the moo,," Enjoyable character-driven story
",Mike is a law student who is also a skilled poker player.  However when he loses everything to Russian player KGB he promises his girlfriend that he'll quit playing.  However a year later Mike's friend Worm comes out of prison and immediately entices Mike into an easy game.  Worm still has outstanding debts and Mike is drawn back into this world in order to help him win enough to pay them off.,/review/rw7127597/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2014,mm-39,6," Just another movie
","Rounders is not a bad movie, but does not stand out either. Rounders is about hold 'em poker, and Matt Damon trying to help a friend, Edward Norton who Matt owes. The Norton doesn't seem to learn his lesson and always relies on others' good nature to help him out of it. He uses his friends and does not seem to care. A couple of side stories where Matt ruins a love interest, and his university. The main story line of Rounders is about dealing with, reading, and playing poker with people. The directing, acting, and story is so so! I watched Rounders off a cable channel. Would I watch Rounders again? No! Just okay. Something to do on a cold February late night. Rounders is a six out of ten. Not a good hand which one would have to bluff their way through.",/review/rw7127597/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2018,seymourblack-1,8," Friendship, Debts & Loyalty
","This fascinating insight into addiction illustrates how a couple of compulsive gamblers suffer in different ways because of their shared obsession with playing high-stakes poker. The sheer excitement and danger that they derive from this endeavour is something that they can't replicate in any other part of their lives and so it becomes the most important thing that they live for and everything and everyone else that they care about, ultimately, has to take a back seat.",/review/rw7127597/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2010,hitchcockthelegend,4," Now look here, I like cards, but give me some character substance to make me care about the players, eh?
","Rounders is directed by John Dahl and written by David Levien & Brian Koppelman. It stars Matt Damon, Edward Norton, John Turturro, John Malkovich, Gretchen Mol, Famke Janssen & Martin Landau. Music is by Christopher Young and Jean-Yves Escoffier is the cinematographer on location in New York & New Jersey. Film is based around the underground world of high stakes poker. Plot sees Poker playing law student Mike McDermott (Damon) team up with his Poker playing ex-con best friend Lester ""Worm"" Murphy (Norton) to try and raise some serious cash. The cash is needed because ""Worm"" has saddled them both with high debts, the sort of debts that can get you killed.",/review/rw7127597/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2005,AdemWeldon,8," This is NOT a Hold 'Em Tutorial
","This film was unjustly panned as lethargic and bleak without a purpose. Considering how Hold 'Em has developed into one of the biggest social fads in the last decade, I would say that this film captures every emotional aspect the 'swings' of No Limit typically carry.",/review/rw7127597/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 1999,Stay Puft,7," A tightly focused vehicle for Damon's charm and swagger.
","This film is incredibly focused.  There is not one throw-away line or one extra frame in the entire movie.  From the first establishing shot to the final line, the production team plays it tight and aggressive.  I couldn't help but think of ""The Hustler"" as I watched, and Damon more than survives this comparison to a young Paul Newman. His swagger and charm and the even, controlled truthfulness of his performance all serve to place him solidly in the game with any of Hollywood's best.  Highly recommended.",/review/rw7127597/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2018,Kirpianuscus,," more than a good film
","At the first sigh, a film about poker. Realistic, well crafted, dark and smart. In fact, the story of growing up of a young man, part of a large and complex game of appearences. It was the film who gives me the opportumity to discover Matt Damon. And his great artistic potential. Short, more than a good film. But an useful exploration of a special universe.",/review/rw7127597/?ref_=tt_urv

","The most vivid, realistic poker movie ever by people who know what they're talking about. The dramatic action and poker action are artfully intermingled, buttressed by excellent performances. The strong story of a young man coming to self-realization makes this especially memorable.",/review/rw7127597/?ref_=tt_urv
