12 September 2008,claudio_carvalho,6," Pleasant Surprise
","The orphan Mandy Lane (Amber Heard) is a beautiful, virgin and pure teenager raised by her aunt, desired by her schoolmates and a close friend of the outcast Emmet (Michael Welch). After the death of their high school mate in a pool party, Mandy befriends Chloe (Whitney Able), Marlin (Melissa Price), Red (Aaron Himelstein), Bird (Edwin Hodge) and Jake (Luke Grimes). Red invites the group for a weekend party in the isolated ranch of his family, with all the boys disputing who would succeed in having sex with Mandy Lane. They meet the henchman Garth (Anson Mount) that takes care of the ranch and he asks the group to go easy on the drugs and booze. In the middle of the night, a stranger wearing a hood attacks Marlin in the barn; when Jake seeks her out, he faces the killer, beginning a night of bloodshed and terror.",/review/rw3063497/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2008,DICK STEEL,7," A Nutshell Review: All The Boys Love Mandy Lane
","All the boys love Mandy Lane, and the way she is portrayed by Amber Heard, who wouldn't? She's blonde, she's demure, she's so hot that the camera in the movie's introduction to the character, lingered on her T&As. She's a fine athlete though we don't really get to know what kind of graaes she's getting. Every boy in school wants to talk to her, and every one of them wants to get into her pants, earning bragging rights to be the first amongst everyone else to have conquered probably the last bastion of virginity in school. People would do silly things like dying for her too.",/review/rw3063497/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2008,andrabem,5," All the boys love Mandy Lane. But why?
","Before renting ""All the boys love Mandy Lane"", I saw its trailer in the YouTube to check it out. Good cameras, interesting story and there were some good reviews in IMDb. Well, maybe I was in for a surprise. You never know. So I took the risk and rented the film. But in the first moments of the film, I noticed that this one was not different at all - it was just another brick in the wall.",/review/rw3063497/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2020,UniqueParticle,9," Stylish delight for a first time director
","Awesome independent film that succeeds in the horror genre at least in my eyes, very satisfying and fair twist involved. Jonathan Levine is a pretty good director for a few films plus in the last few years Amber Heard has done something unfortunate things despite that I still will enjoy some of the projects she was in. I love the soundtrack, cinematography, grotesque kills, and some of the clothes are great!",/review/rw3063497/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2007,kosmasp,7," Mandy laid ...
","... that is how much the Boys love Mandy Lane. But of course this is not another teen ... I mean romantic movie. Nope this is a horror movie. A slasher to be precise. Now slashers do live with two premises: Either a great twist or original killings. In this case, you kinda have both.",/review/rw3063497/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2016,A_Different_Drummer,9," almost perfect slasher film

31 January 2014,Uriah43,6," A Decent Slasher Film
","""Mandy Lane"" (Amber Heard) is the most beautiful and desired person at her high school and all of the guys lust after her. But while she is nice to everyone she only has one person she considers a friend and he is the social outcast named ""Emmet"" (Michael Welch). Then one day she surprisingly accepts an invitation to go to a pool party at the house of another student named ""Dylan"" (Adam Powell) with one provision-that Emmet is allowed to go too. Since Dylan is obsessed with Mandy he reluctantly agrees. Once there Dylan tries to get Mandy to take off her clothes and Emmet interferes. Dylan punches Emmet who then goes onto the roof to get away from the crowd. Eventually Dylan goes up to the roof to try to get Emmet down. Since Dylan is quite drunk Emmet convinces him that Mandy would be very impressed if he jumped from the roof into the pool. Dylan does and bangs his head on the concrete which kills him instantly. Everybody, including Mandy, rightfully blames Emmet. Because of this Mandy decides to start hanging out with some of the more popular students and eventually accepts a weekend invitation out in the country with 3 guys and 2 other girls. What Mandy doesn't know is that the intent of the vacation is to drink and have sex and she is the primary target of the guys. But things begin to take a turn for the worse once they get out there. Anyway, rather than reveal the rest of the story and possibly ruin the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a decent slasher film for the most part. Although some scenes were definitely slow it had more depth than most films of this type. It also had 3 very attractive actresses in Whitney Able (as ""Chloe""), Melissa Price (""Marlin"") and the aforementioned Amber Heard. The ending is also quite wicked. All things considered then I rate this movie as slightly above average.",/review/rw3063497/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2008,dschmeding,8," A real surprise to the slasher genre
","Wow, I didn't expect much from this movie considering that its story sounded pretty mediocre. But it didn't take long to realize that ""All the boys love Mandy Lane"" is far from the typical Slasher Movie and that is because its in all ways superior done... biggest plus is the stunning visuals and cinematography that captures you in a strange dreamlike feeling throughout the movie and is well supported by the use of music which is kind of cynical and used very little but effective. Seeing that this is the first feature film production of Producer Levine I have to lift my thumbs way up for this one! So what do you get... Mandy Lane is a beautiful but rather distanced girl and most boys in her school are after her. After a friend of her dares another guy who is after her to impress Mandy by jumping from a roof ending in a serious accident Mandy distances from him and gives in to join a couple of cool guys and girls on a weekend stay at a land house. You pretty much know whats coming when you got a bunch of teenagers in a house far from other people, so soon the first ones start to disappear. What makes this movie work is the in-depth depiction of the characters, most having their issues behind the mask they wear at high school. A big part of the movie seems to look into a rather bleak and cynical youth, making it seem like a modern high school version of ""Stand by me"" on acid that heavily mixes with Slashers like ""Scream"". If you are in for some serious slashing you don't get much but there is some scenes that are incredibly harsh not so much for the blood but rather for the cynical editing and use of stop-frames and music. After all you are in for 1-2 twists in the end and to me the movie leaves a lot to your own interpretation. But all this makes it enjoyable and different. Definitely give this movie a try because it would be a shame if it got lost in the masses of redundant slasher movies... if you got a little bored with the genre like me ""All the boys love Mandy Lane"" is a real gem.",/review/rw3063497/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2014,mhorg2018,1," Why doesn't IMDb have a Zero rating for trash like this?
","For a while I wondered why this, made in 2006, took until 2013 to be seen. Because simply put, it's trash. Boring, over long, mostly poorly acted, I couldn't figure out why anyone would Love Mandy Lane. This doesn't work as a satire, it doesn't work as a slasher film, it just doesn't work. Poorly written and directed, with some very lame camera shots, there's a dearth of imagination and lack of decent effects in this. Nothing done is original in any way. The best part of it (and I think he should leave this of his resume) is Anson Mount (Cullen Bohannen from Hell on Wheels). This is just one terrible movie. I'm not going to recap the story because there may be someone out there who won't heed the warnings of those who suffered through this and may want to watch it anyone. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.",/review/rw3063497/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2008,seawalker,7," Plenty of stuff beside horror going on in this movie
","I approached seeing ""All The Boys Love Mandy Lane"" with caution. I had heard a rumour that the Protection Of Punters From Horror Movie Cliché's fast response squad (a subdivision of the Committee For Protection Against All Hollywood Movie Clichés) were sweeping UK cinemas and arresting anybody caught watching bad movies about good looking teens being slaughtered by evil forces unknown in remote and eerie locations. The punishment, I heard, was 30 years hard labour watching Martin Lawrence comedies.",/review/rw3063497/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2010,sonicred007,3," I struggled with this ... but ending is OK
",I struggled for most of this film; the archetypes were cliché ridden empty vessels. If Mandy uses her beauty to attract attention that's a hell of a long game and a pointless objective. Why was being an orphan relevant to this script? Why was being beautiful such a distraction for a whole school? Why was the dowdy aunt even in this film? Why did the edgy male in the gang show us he could fire a gun at a clay pigeon? Why do whippets and drugs have a five minute high in this film? Why do I care about any of the characters? Too much of this film is subjective; some shots are excellent and stylised but the content leaves a lot to be desired; some of the gore is well done; in the q & a on the DVD the lead actress talks about awkwardness in Mandy Lane's character as she took her clothes off to join the group in a lake - I saw a classic playboy disrobe shot of a pretty girl. So much potential was overlooked in the script from a very good premise.,/review/rw3063497/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2008,thekarmicnomad,5," More bemusing than thrilling
","This film is definitely unusual. Not a lot really happens, there is a massive amount of time spent getting to know the characters and most of the action is condensed into the last half hour. I am all up for characterisation but there really isn't an awful lot to the characters, and they partake on a whole load of mundane yet embarrassing behaviour. For instance in one scene the girls are talking, one whips down her trousers to sit on the toilet and her friend starts ribbing her about her pubic hair. The film carries on in this general manner, although not graphic or titillating or offensive this snap shot into the lives of over-sexed American teens is just kind of embarrassing to watch (especially with relatives). The camera hovers at breast height for the majority of the film especially when Mandy is running or jumping which is great!, but again makes you feel a bit guilty you are watching so avidly (maybe it is an English thing).",/review/rw3063497/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2006,larry-411,10," Cream of the chop
","I attended the world premiere of ""All the Boys Love Mandy Lane"" at the Toronto Film Festival. From that night on, I couldn't stop talking about it. This film is a gem in so many ways. Young first time director Jonathan Levine has crafted a brilliant twist on the ""old school"" teen slasher flick. With a script by Jacob Forman, who clearly has a passion for the genre, Levine assembled a frighteningly talented cast of young actors who made these characters so real that it seemed improvised. As it turned out, much of it was, as pointed out in the Q&A which followed the screening. When they partied, they partied. And it results in a natural, carefree ensemble performance that makes this film what it is  pure fun. The production values belie the film's meager budget (500K?). For example, the effective use of neutral film stock, under-processed at times, gives segments of the film a home movie look a la ""Blair Witch."" The selective use of slow-mo and freeze-frame add to the ""big movie"" feel of this little indie. As with all good horror films, Levine infuses the film with an appropriately foreboding score. And as an added bonus, the soundtrack features 80's classics which enhance the ""old school"" feel, especially if you're ""old"" enough to have been ""in school"" then. There's plenty of blood and gore here, of course, but tongue is also firmly planted in cheek.",/review/rw3063497/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2010,rraa-dd,1," Shockingly awful
","I expected a decent horror movie, the slasher sort of type. What I got was a piece of garbage, an awful attempt at making a movie. To start off with, Mandy Lane is the only ""good looking"" female in the whole movie. The rest are poor, especially Whitney Able playing Chloe.",/review/rw3063497/?ref_=tt_urv

23 August 2008,Superunknovvn,5," Mandy Lame
","Yeah, I'll admit it. My headline is lamer than this movie could ever be. Truth be told, ""All The Boys Love Mandy Lane"" isn't a complete catastrophe. In fact it starts off quite promising. The cinematography is nice, the music and sound effects are effective and the characters are introduced and played well by the actors and actresses. Unfortunately, as soon as they arrive at the country house where the all the ""horror"" ensues the movie loses direction and gets boring.",/review/rw3063497/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2011,Tweekums,7," Some good scares and a nice sting in the tail
","When I saw this film advertised in the TV guide I didn't know much about it but vaguely recall hearing good things about it so decided to give it a go; while it wasn't amazing it did have plenty of scares, some wince inducing gore and a nice twist at the end. Mandy Lane is the girl all the boys in her high school want to sleep with but she remains virginal and pure. In the opening scene she is invited to a pool party and agrees to go along with her less popular friend Emmet. At the party Emmet persuades one of Mary's suitors that he can impress her by jumping from the roof into the pool, he tries but ends up dead. The action then jumps forward several months and the two are no longer friends because of that incident. When one of her new friends invites her and a few others to stay at his ranch for the weekend she agrees but when they get there things soon go very wrong. Although the group doesn't know it somebody is killing them one by one in some unpleasant ways. When they realise what is happening they must try to get to a vehicle and escape before the killer can get them.",/review/rw3063497/?ref_=tt_urv

11 July 2008,twilight-zone-1,5," Why do they kill? Why??
","That's the big question. I mean this is not the same kind of why, why Michael Myers is killing or the Hitcher-Highwaykiller. I think the end of the film doesn't make sense. Also the fact that they want to kill themselves or at least Emmet. Why they didn't plan to play the badly wounded who survived it, like in the end of ""Scream"" which is anyway copied. And what's the motive of Mandy Lane at all? Emmet does everything what Mandy wants from him, but why does she do all that? There seems to be no reason to take revenge for something or anything else? Only that they go on her nerves that they all want her? That's too airy. Maybe the friends of the guy who crashed at the edge on the swimming pool gave him from then a hard time. But there's nothing to see about that in the movie. And even though it wouldn't make sense, because why should Mandy help Emmet to take revenge when she's not giving' a damn about him?",/review/rw3063497/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2008,grandmastergdogg,1," Worst Slasher In Years
",Looking at these reviews and seeing all these high ratings leave me to believe that large amounts of red corn syrup will please just about any brain dead idiot. This movie is beyond useless. All the cliché's of a slasher film without any substance. I am sure I could go in to details about the movie but why bother when you can sum it up? Obviously everyone wants Mandy Lane and she apparently wants none of the guys. Throughout the movie you will see this.,/review/rw3063497/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2014,Zebb67,1," Been there seen that.
","You'd think after Scream, filmmakers would have concluded that even young teenagers have figured all the slasher movie clichés and the ""twist"" endings can be seen a mile away. Some critics tried to read way to much into this film. The producers knew better; they shelved this turkey for years before finally (barely) releasing it. It then quickly went straight-to-video, which is where most terrible horror films go to die. ***Spoiler Alert*** All virgins in slasher movies are the ultimate target (hardly a spoiler since this has been true of every slasher movie made since Halloween released 36 years ago, but I want to be safe here) and they always seem to survive. You'll easily figure out who's responsible for the killings and it will be no surprise to anyone who's seen one of these films before...I'll leave it at that.",/review/rw3063497/?ref_=tt_urv
