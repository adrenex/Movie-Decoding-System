14 October 2005,rggcandy,9," An old classic almost lost.
","Being a child of... I forget, This show blew me away with what seemed great action and fx. Also who could forget dear old Bulk and Skull. Being older it still is fun to look back on and see how different it looks. It may look silly and cheap in the eyes of adults but to a child it just felt great. There wasn't much of a long plot going on which made it good as if you missed an episode it didn't matter, but saying that the zord changes were good and it made the show more interesting. When will people learn that a young child doesn't care much for plots, that has to wait for when they are a little older. Saddly when they made the zeo series, it would just never be the same. The new series tried too hard. Even as a child I never liked them. Maybe it was the new suits, I mean who designed them? And power rangers in space? It may have appealed to others but I think they should have stayed where they were. Simple enemies that would use the same techniques over and over. Make a monster that starts human size and then grow. And you knew that when they grow the show would almost be over. Oh and I must be dumb to forget the theme tune. I've check and they never made a slightly good theme tune again until this so call wild force series. This show was indeed a classic and I demand they stop making new ones and show the original again for the new generation.",/review/rw1337943/?ref_=tt_urv

","How can u NOT like power rangers? For a 6 year old it was the coolest thing in the world. Good dialogue? Plot lines? Cheesy one liners? Sure they're there, but honestly, do u think a child would REALLY take those into account when thinking whether a show is good or bad? The problem with all u people is that u look at it with an adults point of view. Ask ANY child's opinion, and they would claim that MMPR is one of the best things since sliced bread.",/review/rw1337943/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2005,RayCRP,," It's a great kids show that should be acknowledged for what it is.
","I don't see why everyone here is bashing the original Power Rangers show. Nearly every one of them is saying how now that they've gone back and watched it as an adult, it's got horrible acting, horrible dialog, and cheesy and repetitive themes. Yeah, well, guess what: it wasn't made for you to go back and watch as an adult. It was meant for kids. Kid shows didn't have to have the best acting or best writing. If they had the money to hire people to win awards for superb acting and writing, they wouldn't have wasted their time on a kid show.",/review/rw1337943/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2005,Chandlergellar,10," Mighty Morphin Power rangers are awesome! Watch this one and this one only!
","when i was a little kid, the only that i loved was this, its the best show ever, yeah sure it may look a bit stupid now, but this is what made me believe in myself and that friends stick together! my favourite Character was Billy the blue ranger because he was cool the way he knew everything about well everything. i had such a huge crush on Kimberley the pink Ranger because come on Amy Jo Johnston is amazingly beautiful and i still have a crush on her now. This show also taught kids that violence isn't a good thing and the power rangers always stopped it, even tho it was obvious who they were because they all worked around in the same colour as their costumes, Bulk and Skull, they are legends hands down! they were always trying to a) be the rangers and win over there fans b) trying to find out who they were. i went a bit off it when they replaced Kimberly with a bloned girl, she didn't have the same attitude as Amy Jo and thats why i switched off, but this show will always be the best kids show ever, i guarantee it, forget the other power ranger series, this is the best one, also it was a shame to hear about the girl who played Trini, she was cool too.

","Everyone enjoyed the Power Rangers first seasons. The incredibly cheesy lines, ridiculous plots, and giant monster fight scenes made it all the more watchable. It was definitely watched by more people than you think when it first came out. Everyone tries to hide the fact that they watched it every time a new episode came on. The show was over the top and it rocked. The same thing was going to happen every episode, but it didn't matter. You knew there would be some small fights, Rita would get mad, make her monster huge.. which eventually lead to Morphin Time! Each villain had its own unique ability and look. They all made you laugh. The show lost its luster as it went on, but I guarantee you have to say the first seasons of Power Rangers were a total classic!",/review/rw1337943/?ref_=tt_urv

","A very fun concept: A team of teenagers with attitude are recruited to save Angel Grove from evil. There are fisticuffs back and forth with those who claim to work for justice. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. Against this backdrop, our heroes must fight. The acting is effective, save for a couple of scenes. The metaphors in this show are so abundant, it takes three or four viewings to catch them all. I was deeply impressed, but from an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. This was done superbly without overdoing it.",/review/rw1337943/?ref_=tt_urv

","i have a really big guilty pleasure, and that is that i watch the power rangers, i only watch the first seasons w Jason, Kimberly billy trini zack and tommy and then some w rocky aisha and adam, thats my guilty pleasure of all time i think. i really wish that i could go back in the day and watch them all over again, and be in awe like i was when i was little, and trying 2 be like one of the rangers, i always wanted 2 be like Jason just bc he was the first leader and i thought that he was the best. i think the best episodes were where tommy came into the picture and became the green ranger and gave the rangers a run for their money and when they all got defeated, i thought that it was the end of the rangers, but when in doubt, alpha 5 is always there when the day needs 2 be saved. when i looking on this site i decided to look up the power rangers and see what they were doing now days, i was sad 2 hear that thuy trang, (trini the yellow ranger) died back in 01, i also remember trying 2 collect all the zords and rangers i think i almost had everyone of them and then i started getting older and not wanting 2 play w toys anymore, i don't know what i did w all my toys, but in a weird way i still wish i had them, so that i could reflect on the good ole days.",/review/rw1337943/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2014,moviemattb,10," Classic Show of the 90s
","""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" has always been part of my childhood, and now looking back at it as an adult it stills hold up. It may by cheesy, but it is still a fun show to watch. Most of the action are still awesome with some awesome music and songs by Ron Wasserman. The humor is indeed funny when you have Bulk and Skull in it. The cast did what they have to do and I really do enjoy watching them. Austin St. John will always be the best Red Ranger as much as I like Steve Cardenas. Jason David Frank may be remember as the White Ranger, but he will always be the awesome Green Ranger. Johnny Yong Bosch and Walter Jones were great as the Black Ranger. Same goes to Thuy Trang (May She Rest In Peace) and Karan Ashley as the Yellow Ranger. Even Amy Jo Johnson and Catherine Sutherland as the Pink Ranger. David Yost was really good as the Blue Ranger. The villains such as Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa are really the villains that you love to hate. I do enjoy the suits that the rangers wore and the effects of course look pretty corny, but hey its the 90s and I love it! As I watch the show, I can just turn off my brain and enjoy its mindless entertainment! There are parts that don't make sense, but again it still is a fun show to watch. I love it before and I love it now! ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" is a classic show of the 90s and it is indeed MORPHINOMINAL! I give the show a 10 out of 10!",/review/rw1337943/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2014,byson5186,8," My Story Of The Power Rangers
","I remember watching this show on TV exactly 20 years ago, '94. During that time, the show was hugely popular, and I was obsessed. All these kids seemed to know about the show, and talk about it. There was so much Power Ranger franchise, and from what I remember some of it was hard to find in stores because of the popularity of the show. I remember dressing as the Red Ranger in 2nd Grade that Halloween year, and a lot of the other people at my school were dressed as Power Rangers, mostly the Red Ranger. I remember exciting points in the series, like when Tommy becomes the White Ranger as we hear about a new White Ranger, but aren't sure who he is going to be. I didn't know it was going to be Tommy, except one of my friends at school told me that same day the episode aired that it would be Tommy as he was losing all his powers during this time 20 years ago when Lord Zedd was taking over. I remember my mom reading me a newspaper article on Tommy becoming the White Ranger the next day. I remember feeling amazed at seeing their zord transformations. I also did not know while watching it as a kid how the Power Rangers is based off of a Japanese series, Zyuranger. Looking back at the series, as now you can own copies of the episodes when they aired on TV on DVDs. There have been times when these older episodes aired on ABC Family. You can also watch a lot of the episodes online for free. Watching this show years later will take you back down memory lane. However, you'll see screw ups in the series that you might have slightly noticed as a kid, but will notice more now while watching the series. I also remember going from one year '94 to being obsessed with the show to the school year after in '95 to remembering it, but no longer caring about the show. I stopped watching after Season 2, I saw the Power Ranger movie once in the movie theaters. I liked it but didn't care about it. I also saw the Power Rangers World Tour Live on stage many years ago and enjoyed it, but gradually lose my interest in Power Rangers, not watching Season 3 or caring about it. It also seemed like lots of people lost their interest in the show the year later. Like, it seemed like during the 2nd Half of Season 2 the show just lost a lot of its appeal. I even remember my teacher telling me how she once went to the store and saw all this Power Ranger merchandise. However, when she went back months later she saw Pogs merchandise. Pogs were things you could collect back then. I remember some of the things kids collected in the '90s you no longer hear about today, like pogs, gogos, tamagotchis. Watching the series years later you'll notice some flaws. The show started out with a lot of potential, and I bet it could have been popular much longer if it didn't mess up on certain things. Like here are some flaws I've noticed, one is there isn't much of a plot to the show. Basically, almost every episode would start out at school or the Juice Bar where the characters would talk about an incident and then Rita and Lord Zedd would come up with a monster based on the incident. The show would frequently end with the Power Rangers laughing at Bulk and Skull, I didn't laugh too often while watching the show and didn't think of Bulk and Skull as funny. Another, is there weren't many main characters in the show. There were lots of extras, but the main human characters were mostly just the Power Rangers, Bulk, and Skull, Mr. Caplan Mrs. Applebee, and Ernie. There also was Zordon and Alpha, and then Rita/Lord Zedd and their minions. There was also bad acting. Other flaws, when Jason, Zach, and Trini left the show in Season 2, if you watch those episodes before they get the new rangers you'll be able to tell they're not in there as they don't have much screen time, and are only there for brief recycled scenes. They aren't hanging around the others as they normally are, and their voices are obviously voice-overs. I feel like the show lost a lot of it's appeal after they changed the 3 Power Rangers as while the next 3 Rocky, Adam, and Aisha were still cool, though not as cool. Other flaws for the show, the show seemed to become predictable, even as a kid. A lot of Lord Zedd's monsters were taken down easily even though he was supposed to be the bigger villain with the more Powerful Monsters. So, not angrily I just lose interest in the show. I for one, can't believe a Power Ranger series is still running as most of us probably remember just the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, and it hasn't seemed so popular since then or doing well. You don't really hear about kids watching the show nowadays. I even remember reading a 2001 interview from Jason, Tommy, and Kimberly about being on the show and they thought it was time to cancel the show. It's been many years later and they still haven't canceled it. You can watch episodes of Zyuranger on YouTube with English subtitles. Comparing Zyuranger to Power Rangers, Zyuranger is better. They seemed to have more characters, better acting, more of a storyline, more action, and obviously not screw ups from switching scenes like they'd switch scenes from Zyuranger to Power Ranger shows. I'd give the show an 8/10 as it was good in the day, but still had its flaws. It was nice sharing my thoughts on the Power Rangers. I'm sure a lot of you can agree with what I said.",/review/rw1337943/?ref_=tt_urv

","I just love this show. To me its telling us kids and teenagers that we young generations also have a responsibility to protect the world. Before I go into the my opinion, I would first like to say I am deeply sadden by all the people her who have been bashing around about the MMPR. First off,the show was meant for kids and not adults.

9 April 2003,Aaron1375,," Thank goodness they had better stuff when I was a kid.
","When I was a kid there was He-Man, The Transformers, GI Joe, and The Real Ghostbusters.  I even saw a few Japanese shows that were like this show, but the Japanese shows were much better.  I have only caught a few episodes of this show during my days, but from what I see it is horrible.  A bunch of kids fight monsters using very amateur karate moves.  Who out there thinks this Power Rangers would last a second with someone like Jackie Chan?  Heck, I bet I could take them on all at once.  After awhile the monster turns really big so the Power Rangers get into what amounts to toys.  Toys join together and form a robot...sort of like Voltron, which was a much better series as well.  They fight of the bad guys and then the next episode it starts anew.  All in all I feel sorry for the kids forced to watch this mess.",/review/rw1337943/?ref_=tt_urv

The past few years the film industry has made attempts at making films based on old t.v. shows like ""Power Rangers"" and giving them a more serious overtone.

31 May 2010,brownish33,10," Geez, I STILL watch this show! Ah, the memories!
","i used to watch this all the time as a kid. im 23 now and i still get a kick out of it! i don't care how corny it may be, the original power rangers show was super fun and entertaining. its funny to see the very early 90's cheesy effects but obviously for the time it was probably a huge budget for these episodes. one of the best things about the show was that it wasn't offensive, gross, sexual etc like what passes for ""kids"" shows these days. it taught basic moral values every kids could learn without beating you over the head with it. the cast was likable (every race was represented, black, white, Chinese, nerd, valley girl, lol) and the show had one of the most rockin awesome theme songs EVER. i don't even count the other power rangers spin off shows, its just pointless to try to recast the team again and again, with all the new lamer looking suits. the original suits were simple designs and amazingly, they worked. the villains were often times ridiculous looking, people in costumes, but man its so fun to watch this stuff. the show seems to have a heavy Japanese influence look to it. the show often times looks very toy-etic, looking like they were made to sell toys at certain times, but its like, cool at the same time! i don't know any kid my age who didn't have a power ranger action figure. just recently i saw they brought back the original power rangers to the toy aisles in stores, and being a huge (closet) fan of the original series, i couldn't help but pick them up. i am a geek, and i don't care! this is my childhood, along with the original batman films. this is what i grew up with, so it makes me happy to relive it and hopefully one day i can show these to my kids when i have them.

","I used to watch this show when I was growing up. When I think about it, I remember it pretty well. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things I remember pretty well are the opening sequence and theme song. In addition to that, everyone was ideally cast. Also, the writing was very strong. The performances were top-grade, too. I hope some network brings it back so I can see every episode. It would have been nice if Trini (Thuy Trinh) hadn't passed away. In addition, it would have been nice if everyone had stayed with the show throughout its entire run. It seems nobody does that anymore. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I don't think I've seen every episode.

","I fell MMPR was one of the best shows of all time. It was the starter for the hugely successful series which would last well over the next 10 years. But, i feel the original series was one of the only decent one, which gave way to trash like space and lightspeed rescue. I mean, what a spin off. They cannot even compare with Mighty Morphin'. But kids these days are being dragged into the newer versions, with all their fancy CGI, what happened to good old-fashioned butt-kicking? The old characters were there for a good time, or so it seemed. They always looked there on the set for fun, and the comedy and carelessness gave the series the edge. But now you get dino thunder (HUGE spin off of MM, like dinozords etc) and spd. There is no fun in those. No obvious enjoyment. And the bad guys are a joke, i mean seriously what happened to good old rita repulsa and lord zedd? Now we get a gut with a skeleton head where you can even see the actor's face under the mask, and goldar has been replaced by a posh little girl who does nothing but draw monsters all day. I mean seriously. Get MMPR, which will give you a true perspective of what Power Rangers truly is.",/review/rw1337943/?ref_=tt_urv
