30 January 2006,Smells_Like_Cheese,9," Why were the critics so harsh on the film?
","I thought ""The Island"" was fantastic and just was a movie worth watching. Ewan and Scarlett were just great together in this on the seat thriller, the story was just very exciting. Especially since cloning is such a huge debate right now, I know that it is going to get more intense in the future. That's the story's main plot, cloning and wither it's right or wrong of playing God.",/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2020,burnzyburns,9," Trust me, this movie is very underrated
","Critics hate this movie and who knows why, maybe the expectations for it were huge, but I am telling you The Island is an amazing time.",/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv

","In 2019, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) and Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) are best friends in a repressive and intriguing society, where everybody expects to win the lottery. The prize is to move to a paradisiacal island outside the domes that protect the dwellers against the contaminated environment.

24 July 2005,ScottDMenzel,7," The Popcorn Action Sci-Fi Thriller for summer 2005
","I worked at Eworks when I first saw the trailer for ""The Island."" I wasn't blown away by the trailer and neither was anyone I worked with, mainly because we couldn't figure out what the hell the movie was about. Several trailers and TV spots later, I still felt the same way about it. The only thing about the film that interested me was the cast. I really like Scarlett Johansson, Ewan McGregor, and Steve Buscemi. So considering that there was nothing else out this weekend I decided to give ""The Island"" a chance.",/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2005,qball_82,7," Underrated!
",I found The Island to be highly enjoyable - a great Summer blockbuster that isn't quite mindless. It raises a number of very interesting questions...,/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2020,UniqueParticle,9," Exhilarating great concept
","I absolutely love the dialogue and wild action! Among one of few Micheal Bay films that is awesome, I forgot how enthralling The Island is. Ewen Mcgreggor did so good throughout along with everyone else like Sean Bean he's a great villain in most anything. I imagine the budget was wildly expensive especially with destruction, cars, and the special effects. Quite a unique Sci-Fi very original, mind blowing cat and mouse on a large scale.",/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,5," A good story, until the over the top action gets in the way
","THE ISLAND is one of those films that starts off promising with an intriguing first hour before descending into the kind of banality that only Michael Bay knows how to make – see TRANSFORMERS for another good example. For the first hour or so we're put into an institutionalised world of clones and cloning and the suspense moves along quite a bit. Although the movie is obviously heavily derived from others that have come before it – LOGAN'S RUN, MINORITY REPORT, most noticeably THE CLONUS HORROR (the makers of whom were compensated due to the 'similarities'), it moves along nicely with some nice supporting acting to drive us along. All right, so Bay's camera-work can be a bit distracting (vertigo-inducing at times) but I was really enjoying it.",/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2007,mstomaso,7," Just a little better than pretty good, but also just a little unoriginal
","Michael Bay has had his directoral ups and downs, but here in the big budget action realm, the director of the excellent The Rock seems right at home. This time, Bay welds the action to a solid, if somewhat unoriginal sci fi plot - which blends elements of Logan's Run, THX-1138 and Gattaca.",/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2005,BigHardcoreRed,," The Island Is A Mighty Fine Movie.
","The Island is about the possibility, in the not too distant future, of a clone farm, for lack of a better term. When dealing with clones, especially in the movies, problems usually arise due to the lack of knowledge in the area. In this particular movie, it does not give away that they are clones too soon (unless you saw the preview). We are eased into their predicament slowly, although something is quite different and not right. At the beginning, I got sort of a Truman Show kind of feel to the movie, as they are always being watched, either by computers or cameras, and their lives are controlled in just about every detail.",/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2005,Mr_Sensitive,7," """"The Island"" Is What Gives Them Hope""
","I have every movies of Michael Bay, and I got to say  this is probably his best. Though the story is nothing new and it has a lots (loads) of resemblances of his previous work; I really enjoy watching it. But it actually the actors (Ewan and Scarlett) who made this movie so interesting.",/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2015,LeonLouisRicci,9," Maybe Michael Bay's Best Movie
","Critics Favorite Whipping Boy, Director Michael Bay, has Made a Movie that Begs for Reconsideration. At Least for the Moment. The Always Overblown Style is Here Combined with a Good, if Derivative Story. The Timeless Trope of Dystopia, Deception, and Big Brother Sins that Have Become a Fertile Film Farm for Animals on the Hack.",/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2006,ma-cortes,7," Powerful story with awesome and young actors: Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson
","This movie is more than an action film,it's a great story with interesting characters .The picture displays action packed,car chases,things blowing up and crashing and bad guys and good guys fighting.The action is up and running and the chase is on.It's a fun ride but also there's a real human core,it's the kind of film with something at the heart of it.Michael Bay created a facility as a secret place underground like a private sector corporation.It was the biggest set ,it was built at a Boeing plant in a one of the largest sets ever shot,it was five football fields long.This inside environment of the clone village or city takes part of its clue from the fact that it's converted in a military underground bunker.It's kind of like a ¨Big Brother¨place,they watch over you.The film contains exceptional images as when a big camera shot that follows through a hole in the wall and then the camera starts spiraling down a really tall set and we see the ¨Agnates¨in various stages of development and the camera continuing through the cables into the department of operations which is where inadvertently the lifeblood of the facility is going through the hands of the clones but they are creating themselves.",/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2018,SILMARILLI,8," Great sci-fi film with cool hook. One of the better ones.
","This one of the few really good sci-films Bay has done. Not like the crappy Transformer films. This one makes you think - what if - you woke up one day and discovered your world was nothing more than a lie the is another world out there and it is the real one! Your world is shattered and you discover that you are not you but a CLONE. Are you really you or is the real you, you? Then the horror of the your situation is discovered you are considered nothing more than spare parts. Some day the real you will drink to much and need a new liver and guess who they are going to take it from - YOU ! ! !",/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2020,leonweis,8," Awesome sci-fi action
","A movie which has one of the most interesting and on the same level disturbing plot in Science-Fiction. Cloning is an interesting topic and how they created here a world of adult children living the innocent live before killed behind closed doors for their organs is just an amazing idea and terrifying also. I know this movie seems to be a rip-off but it's way better designed. Unfortunately the interesting parts are after 45 min over and we get to see a lot of action, which at some point is just over the top Michael Bay stuff. I think it's ok to do it like this, because you feel better for our two heros, but they could have given the story a bit more. They put so much money in the product design of all the levels inside this bungalow in the desert and then they give it not a lot screen time. The ending suggests that it's very positive that they live now a free life, but in fact they will not be happy in that world because they have no family, no education, no home. In fact only the two hero's can live the live of their real counterparts because their counterparts have died. All the others will have a life which is not easy, but it's a life!",/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2006,ccthemovieman-1,6," Stylish, But Not What I Expected
","Scientists creating ""clones"" are the villains in this movie and they make them in the future to provide their human counterparts replacements for defective body parts. The only problem is that one of the clones (Ewan McGregor) starts to become human with feelings, emotions, etc. He is then joined by a female clone (Scarlett Johansson) and the two them try to escape their surrounds - a prison- like laboratory in the middle of the desert in the U. S. A.",/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2005,seaview1,7," The Island is a fun, summer flick
","Michael Bay has directed some big budget action adventures that have an over-the-top feel (like Pearl Harbor and Armageddon). He tones it down a bit and, despite borrowing from a myriad of past films, his latest effort, The Island, is an intelligent, entertaining adventure with science fiction as its source material.",/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2005,anhedonia,1," A good example of what's wrong with Hollywood
","Hollywood studio execs bemoaned the loss of revenue this summer. Every weekend, they kept coming up with new excuses, new reasons, new explanations as to why box-office receipts were low. They blamed the weather, proliferation of home theaters, DVD sales, rude movie patrons. Very few, if any, were willing to admit that the main reason fewer people went to movies this summer was because the most of the films stunk! ""The Island"" is a great example.",/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2005,Animus,3," Clonus Horrors Revisited
","Ouch. I knew this movie would never live up to the hype as soon as I saw the trailer and recognized the plot as a direct steal from ""Parts:The Clonus Horror"" a movie a gleefully laughed at on Mystery Science Theater 3000 some years ago. Although this remake has been jazzed up and given spiffy special effects and a huge budget for blowing things up the story is just as badly thought out. The plot leaks like a sieve,life for the clones is un-fulfilling and is causing psychological problems for some (meds anyone?), the huge number of people working behind the scenes to keep things secret (that many people can't keep a secret, lowly wage slaves least of all), holographs to display the ""contaminated"" world (they are UNDERGROUND, just tell them that), and of course the fact that at least 50 or more people were killed in the chase scenes, no one would ever notices that in LA. Sigh but worst was the ending, it was so ripped from ""Logan's Run"" I expected to see Peter Ustinov waving at the clones. Yay, they are free.... in the middle of the Arizona desert... with no food or water... and no press to show the world.... right. Save your money. Save your mind.",/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv

24 July 2005,gregsrants,7," Part 1984 and Logans Run with plenty of action to boot
","As a self proclaimed most hated man amongst critics in Hollywood, Michael Bay has done nothing over the years to deflect his growing reputation. His filmography reads like a loud speaker of summer trash including Bad Boys I and II, The Rock, Armageddon and Pearl Harbor. Each of these films was panned by critics like Alaskan gold in 1896. Their success at the box office however is teetering on a money in the bank title as his last four ventures have all made over $100 million and if we include the foreign and DVD market intake, Bay has become the youngest and quickest director to ever become a Billion Dollar Man.",/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2020,DrTuvok,6," So close
","2019? Darn it, if they only would have moved the year up by one this would have been a hilariously prophetic movie. Loved all the talk about 'contamination', 'quarantine', and 'proximity alerts'. These type of buzzwords are all over the place now, so that would have made the movie even funnier.",/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2006,Thunderbuck,7," *shrug* Worked for me
","As big action-blockbusters go, ""The Island"" isn't bad, and deserves a better life on video than it had at the box office. I'd hardly call it great, but like all good science fiction, it has it's basis in ideas, and this movie holds to its ideas well.",/review/rw5343303/?ref_=tt_urv
