1 April 2016,ahassan-12342,2," Divergent... Insurgent... Washing Detergent
","The worst of the Divergent series to date, in Allegiant we finally see what lies beyond the walls which encircle Chicago. Answer: 120 minutes of utter tedium. We follow our protagonists- doe-eyed Tris and perpetually dull Four- through the wastelands and into the hands of sinisterly-titled Bureau of Genetic Welfare, led by Jeff Daniels' character David.",/review/rw3504443/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2016,ThomasDrufke,4," Yet Another Clichéd and Predictable Young Adult Film
","The age of the young adult franchises are upon us now more than ever with yet another entry in the 'Divergent' series being released. Maybe it's just me, but I'm growing tired of weak films filled with same old clichés and unoriginal story lines based around the genre of 'young adult sci-fi'. Sure, a lot of people can say the same thing about the overabundance of superhero films, but there's a clear difference in quality. But the bottom line is that I'm just not the audience for these films.",/review/rw3504443/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2016,claudio_carvalho,4," Too Long and Boring Franchise
","""The Divergent Series: Allegiant"" is another part of this too long and boring franchise. The saga of Tris and Four and their friends is repetitive and predictable, using clichés and special effects. The screenplay is poor and stupid. For example, David is capable to close doors and remotely controls the city; why does he need someone to release the gas in Chicago? The worst is that the story does not end and there will be another sequel to gross more money for the producers. My vote is four.",/review/rw3504443/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2016,baberchik,3," ridiculous nonsense
","OK so the first movie (""Divergent""), despite what the people who read the books say, was basically another soap opera - slash - action movie directed at what I am guessing teen audience. Just like Mockingjay, just like Maze Runner. But despite the absolute soap overload in some parts at least the plots were somewhat original though they all had that tell-tale post-apocalyptic-dystopic- 1984ish plot commonality, but all of them kinda ""did okay"" at least in each own way and at least managed to have SOME major and original plot differences that made them over all okay and entertaining to watch.",/review/rw3504443/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2016,LiveYoLifeLikeYouMeanIt,3," Inexplicably bad
","The first two installments in this series were if nothing else enjoyable. The first one, in fact, was well acted and directed, with a satisfying plot and held its own. The second which did have a wayward plot and a messy script was still salvaged by the acting and the cgi-fuelled set pieces which were cool to look at. But this movie fails in every possible aspect.",/review/rw3504443/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2016,lauravankessel,3," Well.... that was horrible!
","So... Without spoiling the book OR this movie; the movie sucked, the book did not. There is way, way more sci-fi then necessary, and BAD sci-fi that is! It's really poorly done, bad CGI and stuff. And where the story from the books was at times confusing, this was downright dumb and mad no sense. The biggest book-moments were cut out, probably to make room for the bad CGI... I kind of expected it to be bad, 'cause the 2nd one wasn't that good either. It also seems the actors get less and less convincing with each movie. Contrary to the Hunger Games (that also differed from the books somewhat, but functional imho), these don't live up to the books at all. If you read them, don't watch the movies. If you've watched the movies but started liking them less and less, read the books instead! They're worth it!",/review/rw3504443/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2017,ericaharris1908,1," Another ridiculous movie
","I am trying to keep from falling asleep from this boring, stupid, stupid, did I say stupid movie. Asinine, ridiculous, this movie could be renamed, ""How to bore your audience to death"" or ""Movie for braindead corpses"". I feel stupid for watching this so called 'movie'. And I am watching it for free and I still want my money back. Terrorist groups don't need any old torture devices, they can use this movie. Bad acting, check. Stupid plot line, check. Very big, gigantic plot holes that make absolutely no sense, check. You don't care if everyone in the movie does a horrible, painful death, check. Through out the movie you will roll your eyes, sigh heavenly, saying things like ""Why are they doing that?"" and ""That makes no sense."", check. **Spoilers, you knew the one chick was going to die when they got on top of the wall. No bullets hit Tris or Four although they were being shot at at close range and with machine guns, and they didn't get shot as they climbed up the wall. Despite the land outside the wall being completely jacked up from nuclear war, the land is completely toxic, yet people are able to survive on the fridges in tents!!!Where were they getting food and water!!! These people are supposedly exposed to all kinds of toxic fumes, toxic land but they all look normal!!!? Oh, but the Genetic Manipulation place was able to survive the nuclear fall out and create a grass growing (again ON WHAT IF THE WHOLE WORLD IIS A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST!!!) And the motivations for the characters, stupid, stupid, stupid. David, who you KNEW and the new section were evil. Absolutely nothing shocking. You knew who was going to die, you knew who was evil. And why did Four go back to Chicago? And how did he survive walking through the nuclear wasteland with no issues!! We are living in the last days, common sense is out, insane people rule the world and make the movies. Finding an actual good these days is like trying to find the holy Grail or a needle in a haystack.",/review/rw3504443/?ref_=tt_urv

21 May 2020,lonnielongino,6," Real drop off from first two!
","Allegiant was rather disappointing considering i really enjoyed the first 2 movies. This one was very lackluster on the action and Tris character was much less involved in the plot. I hate the fact that this movie ended on a cliffhanger though. Because it has been 4 years ago and due to the bad box office this film got, there has been no real try to make a fourth and final film.",/review/rw3504443/?ref_=tt_urv

9 March 2016,Giacomo_De_Bello,4," 4/10
","I will not blame anyone who has given up hope with this franchise and passed on checking out this. I went because I am Sheilene Woodley's number one fan and supporter (check my reviews of her films for proof on that), so anything she does I will see, included this franchise which for me, in the first two entries, proved to be a mix of some few good elements, Woodley's performance being center on that, with some bad filmaking overall and a story that was always so bad it made me laugh.",/review/rw3504443/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2016,siderite,5," So lazy it hurts
","The movie takes the exact same plot, style and ideas from the first two films in the series and does absolutely nothing new with them. There is less tension, everything makes no sense, is in your face obvious and bland. ",/review/rw3504443/?ref_=tt_urv

8 April 2016,tmna-959-180986,1," I Want My $ Back
","Two hours after the movie ended, and I'm still shaking my head. Disgusted. Seems writers, director and producer DID NOT READ THE BOOK. I do not expect a movie to follow the book exactly, but the other 2 movies mostly did. The 3rd movie had very little to do with the first two. No point to the changes, it did not make the story more powerful, it actually neutered it. I can't see how Veronica Roth could have been happy with the Allegiant movie. Poor Naomi Watts, her lines were so horrible. Her Evelyn was just whinny. Miles Teller had nothing to do. The world they created in the movie, the airport and the fringe, not at all accurate. Again, the changes were pointless. If you are a fan of the Divergent Trilogy, do not bother with this movie.",/review/rw3504443/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2016,pendenquejohn,2," Boring, predictable and annoying
","I have to admit, I did not read the book but I agree with the general consensus that this was a movie principally written fro the teens. I've encountered this many times where it is complicated to judge a bad movie and here's that same problematic once again. Quite frankly, I am genuinely surprised by the high rating on IMDb when I really did not get that feeling.",/review/rw3504443/?ref_=tt_urv

12 July 2016,tytoowls,1," As a Reader...
","I read all of the books because of how curious I was to see if the movies matched up. What I really enjoy in an adaptation movie is how it brings a story to life; Allegiant takes the story which was quite interesting, and throws the story line in pieces. The suspense and anticipation that I experienced with the previous two films and stories is not the same as with Allegiant. Besides the story line taking a tangent from its original story, the revised story line is bland and predictable. I do not have high expectations for the sequel if they continue to deviate from the original story so drastically. I really hope that I will be proved wrong, but I am thoroughly disappointed.",/review/rw3504443/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2016,khororus,1," Ahh.....
","For this one, I will not need many words to write a review. This one is plainly stupid. Unnatural human behavior, unnatural dialogues, plot filled with holes like a good Dutch cheese! Just one example: Director controls shutting of doors in an underground technical tunnels of the distant city, yet he needs to infiltrate a city with a person to talk one of the leaders into pushing a button to get a gas flowing into the city! Would be a good idea to have that function also on a remote control, wouldn't it? Or if everyone will forget everything, why not fly a freaking squadron into the city and have this button pushed? A separate word of praise to movie industry censors! Killing where blood is seen – R rated and kids can't watch it. Killing when no blood is seen – kids are safe to watch. How could one make it all be more ridiculous? The guys gets a headshot from 1 inch distance, falls dead, but no drop of blood to be seen anywhere Come on guys, someone needs to get real.",/review/rw3504443/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2016,alci350,1," That was an experience..
","I used to joke I want my money back when I saw bad movies. But I was so angry with this one, I didn't care about the money. I wanted my time, my Saturday evening back! As a matter of principle I never leave a movie in the middle, but the more I saw the senseless ""acting"" and ""story"", the more I became irritated.. I love sci-fi, I could even watch the cheapest one and still be satisfied. But when they make ""something"" as horrible as this, something with no connecting storyline, no sense of the slightest sign of logic, no consequence/connection to any scenes that just played, the constant building up to nothing over and over again. I just felt like being treated like a moron with a 3 second memory, who could be 'woawed' by the scenes, but doesn't know or care what happened 3 second before that. I came out the movie angry and stressed. This is beyond bad, this deserves a -10. Not only that, this movie should be banned from human history. Save yourselves!",/review/rw3504443/?ref_=tt_urv

","Here comes the most expected adventure in the 'Divergent' series. I always wondered what lies outside the wall. So this sequel takes us to the new land where a fresh development takes place. A few old characters were terminated in order to introduce a bunch of new ones. As a theme, it just looked like 'The Scorch Trial', but of course totally a different setting.
