1 December 2021,planktonrules,9," I was so expecting to hate this!
","I had no interest in seeing ""Cruella""...none at all. After all, I really hated the two previous live action films based on the ""101 Dalmatians"" series. But my daughter insisted I watch it with her, as she said it is a silly but really enjoyable film...and after seeing it I agree. But I would also add that it is very well written...and I loved some of the dialog. I was expecting to give it a 2 or 3 and end up now giving it a 9!",/review/rw7088373/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2021,Sleepin_Dragon,8," What a surprise.
","I went in to the cinema expecting to be disappointed, or to nod off, but I have to admit, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It's dark, it's funny, it's utterly entertaining. It just goes to show that when film makers are given an imaginative script, the magic can still happen.",/review/rw7088373/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2021,robfollower,9," There's one thing this film gets right, it's the soundtrack.
","Cruella is brilliantly written, acted and portrayed. Emma Stone is a scene stealer ! She is brilliant . Do not let the premise of the film put you off, Cruella is a hidden gem of action , humor, fashion with dazzling costumes, a great soundtrack, and a pair of terrific performances from Emma Stone and Emma Thompson, this dazzling visual feast is extremely fun to watch whenever its leading ladies lock horns. Cruella is one groovy piece of summer block buster cinema. I would add , Disney production maybe headed for an Oscar nomination ""Best Makeup"" Academy Award nomination .",/review/rw7088373/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2021,willcrabbe,8," The best live action Disney film in years
","This is a film I did not see myself enjoying as much as I did. Serving as a (sort of) prequel to 101 Dalmations, Cruella is set in 1970s London during the punk rock movement and follows the character Estella (Emma Stone) as she attempts to make it in the fashion industry. She is taken under the wing of the vindictive and domineering Baroness von Hellman (Emma Thompson) and quickly learns secrets that will push her along the path to becoming the villainous Cruella De Vil.",/review/rw7088373/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2021,vignesh-av24,8," What a surprise!
","To be really honest, I had very low positive thoughts about this movie. But, boy was I in for a surprise. Emma Stone is the show stealer. It's really a fun dark movie. Did expect this from Disney. Loved it!!",/review/rw7088373/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2021,steven-leibson,9," What if Disney combined Birds of Prey, Oceans Eleven, Devil Wears Prada, James Bond, and Vivienne Westwood
","Can you make an entertaining film by blending features from the Joker's girlfriend Harley Quinn in ""Birds of Prey,"" a successful heist film like Oceans Eleven, the daring of a Bond film, a swath of ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" and meld it with the 1970's London punk fashion story of designer Vivienne Westwood? Can you do all that as a backstory for a six-decade old, animated Disney feature film? Can you sew all those different fabrics and parts into one cohesive garment? Apparently, you can. There is so much brilliant writing, over-the-top performance, and spot-on production brilliance packed into this movie that it must simply be seen to be appreciated. I've never seen a movie like this and I don't think there's a written explanation that can do it justice. If you love all sorts of films like the ones listed above, you'll love this film.",/review/rw7088373/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2021,nogodnomasters,10," It is pronounced De Vil.
",This is the back story to a Disney villain. Like Maleficent they create a complex character that is not all evil and certainly didn't start that way. Estella lived as a street orphan at an early age and wanted to be a designer. She becomes employed by the Baroness only to discover they have a history she did not know about.,/review/rw7088373/?ref_=tt_urv

18 October 2021,TxMike,," The Cruella origin story.
","This movie has a fine cast, led by the two Emmas, Stone as the grown up Cruella and Thompson as the evil, self-centered Baroness. This is the Cruella origin story, set in London in the 1970s.",/review/rw7088373/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2021,Xamalion,10," Both Emmas are stunning
","It is one of the best villain origin stories to date. I had so much fun watching that I didn't even see the twist coming, and when it hit, it hit in all the right places and took the whole story on another level.",/review/rw7088373/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2021,Calicodreamin,8," Kind of amazing
","Okay so cruella was actually kind of amazing. The cinematography and costuming were breathtakingly beautiful. The storyline took a few weird turns, but for the most part really worked. The characters were well cast and well acted. The Emma's slayed being maniacally deranged.",/review/rw7088373/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2022,Avwillfan89,7," Good movie. But it has nothing to do with 101 Dalmatians
",The film should have been labelled Estella. I know that the name Cruella is the persona that the main character transforms in eventually - but this should be no means be taken seriously as the 101 Dalmatians villain's origin story. Because it makes no sense if you do.,/review/rw7088373/?ref_=tt_urv

27 August 2021,DarkVulcan29,9," Emma Stone was born to play Cruella
","I never saw Glenn Close has Cruella in the two dalmations movies, but Glenn Close is a terrific actress, but Emma Stone brings an incredible charismatic charm when she plays Cruella, her british accent seems convincing enough to the point where you'll forget she's american.",/review/rw7088373/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2021,orbrium,10," I thought I knew what to expect but half way through I knew I loved this movie...and loved Wink!
","I stereotyped it before I even saw it. Starting it I was like ok this is the Devil Wears Prada...right? It had more story than I expected, more beauty than I expected, more subtlety than I expected and I knew I loved this movie when I knew I loved Wink the Dog. I thought all the actors did a great job. I was impressed at the actor that played Horace.....is that name right? Last I had seen him in was Richard Jewell which was so serious but in this movie he had more comic talent than I expected from him. I had never heard the song from Iggy Pop before but now I find myself singing it. I loved loved this movie. I'm excited to watch it over and over again.",/review/rw7088373/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2021,deloudelouvain,8," Entertaing and well made.
","To be honest I didn't think I was going to enjoy this movie. For some reason I thought it would be a kid movie but the truth is that Cruella is for all ages and very entertaining. The two Emma's (Stone and Thompson) are the major reason for that. They're both skilled actresses and they did a very good job playing their characters. The cinematography is of high quality which was also a thing that made this movie stand out from the rest. And even though the main characters are not very likable persons the story is entertaining from beginning till the end. The dog characters added something cute to the story. Hats off for this movie, much better than I thought it would be.",/review/rw7088373/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2021,ernestoherreraf,9," My darling, this movie is brilliant!

2 October 2021,cherold,6," Not great, but there are moments
","I was underwhelmed by the trailer for Cruella, which looked dumb, and didn't hear much good about it, but I love Emma Stone so I thought I'd give it a chance. But while Stone is good, it's the Emma I didn't realize was in this that supplies the best moments.",/review/rw7088373/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2021,kosmasp,7," The Deville wears Prada (and other costumes)
","Ah the name puns. You gotta have them, right? The answer is obviously yes. So a bad or rather evil character as we know her ... or knew her? - is now back with an origin story. I have to admit, I have some issues with the movie overall or rather the morality is serves. Not to mention the kind of making away of what she becomes ... or making it ok, because of what happened to her.",/review/rw7088373/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2021,HabibieHakim123,10," My Personal Best Movie In 2021 So Far
","""Another Shadow In The Cloud Phenomena happened again in Cruella, i made a thing called Shadow In The Cloud Phenomena which means the movie did have a bad scene, a weird scene, or a boring scene, but in this case is an ok scene, and then comes this scene that was so good, it's make me hype, it's make me amazed, then i erase that whole thing, i know it sounds weird or non sense but whatever, i don't care, everyone have they're own thing, and again Cruella isn't perfect from the beginning till the middle then come this whole greatness and awesomeness and it burns all that out, Emma Stone is a very very perfect cast as Cruella De Vil, the supporing actor was good and funny, the cinematography was surprisingly incredible, the music is all perfect, everytime they put the music it always a great song, the costume was fascinating, Cruella is so far my personal best movie in 2021, replacing Godzilla Vs Kong in my number one place for best movie in 2021, Cruella is just a perfection, i highly recommended""",/review/rw7088373/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2021,gobraves9-259-630922,9," Absolutely Stunning
","This is hands down the BEST Disney film I've seen in years and has the best soundtrack I've ever heard. Emma Stone is hypnotic as Cruella, Emma Thompson is delightfully wicked. The ancillary characters are very strong, as well. This film should received multi Oscar nods for acting, fashion, cinematography, and direction. The films' only drawbacks were the iffy CGI Dalmatians and particular animal references to skunks and raccoons that most outside the UK would never pick up on; neither animal is found in the UK.",/review/rw7088373/?ref_=tt_urv

4 July 2021,Brooklynsmagicmike,9," Honestly was shocked by how great this was.
