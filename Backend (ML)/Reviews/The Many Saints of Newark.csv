24 May 2006,ExpendableMan,8," A criminally under rated horror masterpiece
","Unfairly dismissed as a combination of Alien and Hellraiser, Event Horizon is one of those films that should be ranked among the classics of it's genre yet has somehow fallen by the wayside to be revered by movie geeks and horror aficionados but ultimately ignored by the mainstream. What's especially surprising is that this excellent film came from the directing skills of Paul W Anderson who was also responsible for such tragic misfires as Resident Evil and Alien Versus Predator and shows that there is more to Hollywood's Generic Director For Hire than first imagined.",/review/rw1065721/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2021,Aaron1375,8," I would love to see the director/s cut of this.
","Ah test audiences, if not for you, we would of had a way more disturbing and horrific movie. They pick random people, probably a broad variety, but bland as all get out to help the studio execs gut a director's vision. Probably not even horror fans. What we get is good, but the potential is there for it to be way more disturbing, a horror film that is totally fabricated, but still resonates. Though, this one is good as I so enjoy the supernatural and then to combine it with science fiction...awesome!",/review/rw1065721/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2004,rparham,7," Effectively disturbing
","At first glance, Event Horizon would appear to be a science fiction film through and through. It's set in the future, features spacecraft and the men and women who fly them, and is about a rescue mission to another spacecraft. Yet, before long, it's quickly obvious that Event Horizon is, in fact, a horror film set in space, and a surprisingly effective one at that. While not a masterpiece, it is a reasonably disturbing film.",/review/rw1065721/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2002,Agent10,7," A good mix of horror and sci-fi
","This film was a lot better than what most people gave it credit for. The cinematography was excellent, and the lighting gave the film a very eerie feel to it. Certainly better than the average sci-fi film. Not only did the film mix two mediums almost perfectly (sci-fi and horror), it completed the union almost flawlessly. Not a perfect movie, but then again, Sam Neill was amazing in this film. Virtually all of the technical aspects in the film were top-notch. While it didn't advance the film industry overall, it did make an impact in the sci-fi genre.",/review/rw1065721/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2009,Chrysanthepop,," Hell's Horizon
","'Event Horizon' is very much an atmospheric sci-fi horror. It does not rely on gore (although there is enough of that) but rather it is the creepy atmosphere that engages the viewer. Andersen successfully creates a tense, depressing, and claustrophobic atmosphere. The suspense and pace are well maintained. It pays tribute to several movies of the same genre (like 'The Shining', 'Aliens' etc). Character development is slightly weak but the actors do a good job and the viewer cares for them. Sam Neill, Laurence Fishburne, Kathleen Quinlan, Joely Richardson, Richard Jones and Jason Isaacs do a fine job with what they're given. The sets look very unwelcoming and creepy. The special effects and sound effects are good. The cinematography is superb. The plot is a little complex and difficult to follow in the beginning leaving the viewer wondering with what exactly is going on but this becomes easier with repeated viewings. In my view, 'Event Horizon' is an underrated film and perhaps did not get enough recognition because it did not have any stars or enough 'monsters' and 'blood' or perhaps the subject was a little too complex for some to grasp.",/review/rw1065721/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2003,Danny_G13,," Decently structured sci-fi horror
","Event Horizon is a decent movie. There's no question it's never going to win awards for originality, or anything else, frankly, but what it does it does well. It's based on the idea of a space ship, which disappeared just under a decade ago, reappearing mysteriously, prompting a search and rescue vessel to go in and investigate. Telling more would spoil the premise, so no more will be said. It is all set in the future, as much sci-fi is, and deep in outer space, of course. The performances are as polished as you'd expect from Sam Neill, as the doctor, and Laurence Fishbourne, as the scout ship captain, so there are generally no complaints there. The gore levels at times are not for the squeamish, but what else would you expect from an 18 (UK) rated movie? There are a fair number of predictable moments, and cliched lines, but the overall production is more than decent and able to keep your attention focused on the plot. A good effort all round, and the overall 5.5 rating it received here is a touch harsh. I'd say 7.",/review/rw1065721/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2006,Maarten1985,7," Decent sci-fi/horror - Underrated
",EVENT HORIZON is a pretty good sci-fi/horror movie which you'll either love or hate. It's a very dark and depressing movie which completely justifies the 'terror' in the tag-line. Perhaps the continuing terror is why some people probably dislike it.,/review/rw1065721/?ref_=tt_urv

","Originally conceived as THE SHINING in space, by the end I think EVENT HORIZON has become more like HELLRAISER in space, although of course one of the later HELLRAISER movies was just that. This is an intriguing and interesting sci-fi/horror movie that initially feels like an ALIEN clone before becoming something else quite different.",/review/rw1065721/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2012,Tweekums,8," A disturbing sci-fi horror
",The Spaceship 'Event Horizon' disappeared near Neptune while on a classified mission to test a new drive system that could make interstellar travel a possibility; seven years later a broadcast was received and the rescue ship 'Lewis and Clark'. This ship's regular crew has been joined by Dr. Weir; the designer of the 'Event Horizon' and the only person to know the nature of the ship's revolutionary drive system; it uses a singularity to fold space enabling it to pass between two points almost instantly. Strange things start to happen once they arrive; scanners show lifeforms everywhere on the 'Event Horizon' and once aboard the crew start having strange visions of people they once knew; dead people! It would appear that that when the gateway opened for its test flight to Proxima Centauri it went somewhere on the way; a place of pure chaos and evil; for want of a better word Hell itself! By the time the crew realises something is wrong; it isn't a question of whether they whether get away alive it is a question of whether any of them will survive.,/review/rw1065721/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2005,Megn1,10," So brilliant its hard to believe Paul Anderson directed AVP.
","This is without a doubt one of the greatest horror films ever made! I wouldn't classify it as sci-fi even though it does pay homage (or some would say rip-off) to many of the greats, such as Alien and The Black Hole. This is a pure horror film and also has a b-movie charm. This is the kind of movie William Castle would be directing if he was still alive today, but much better! It is the best haunted house movie of the lot, but its set in a spaceship.",/review/rw1065721/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2005,wouterbrugge,8," Ominous
","There's something really special about this movie, but I can't put my finger on it. Maybe it's the combination of sci-fi and horror, which create a very distinct atmosphere that you can just feel throughout the entire flick. Maybe it's the idea of a hell-dimension, accessible through a black hole, something so far away yet so close-by that gives me the creeps. Even though you don't see anything of this don't-wanna-be-there-dimension, the effect it has on the crew just says it all. The plot maybe quite simple, but the film doesn't dwell too much on it, it does not imply it is a mind-blowing idea. You won't hear Laurence Fishburne saying: 'Oh, my God! A hell dimension! How is it even possible?!' Nothing in the movie is scarier than stuff I've seen before, still the scariness of Event Horizon isn't in the gore, nor in the shock and awe moments. No, it's in the atmosphere. It's in the ominousness which somehow grabs you and doesn't let go. It's in the gut-feeling. Event Horizon is a gut-movie. Maybe that's the thing I couldn't put my finger on.",/review/rw1065721/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2001,Spleen,1," There's a difference between darkness and blackness.
","Darkness is frightening, because we don't know what it contains.  Blackness isn't frightening - it's just ugly and off putting, like the flourescent greens that also figure so heavily in the colour scheme, like the sudden loud noises and the lascerated flesh.  ""Event Horizon"" doesn't know the difference between scary, startling, and sickening.",/review/rw1065721/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2003,BradleyUK,8," Sci-Fi Shock sensation
","Its not the best film I've seen yet this was the best experience I've had in a cinema. After getting lost & sh*t scared driving around dark English country lanes I arrived at the cinema already in quite a state. And from the moment I heard the rocking Orbital opening track I was transfixed. I was in the perfect mood to watch this film and it delivered more than I could have hoped in a cinema experience. After repeated home viewings it does lose its shock factor yet it is still a great film, though I have to add it really was meant for the big screen. The sets are great, the gore is shocking & the ship design is truly beautiful. Admittedly the Event Horizon borrowed its look from '2001' yet they took that long majestic shape & gave it a more modern gritty feel. A few bits of ham acting (listen to when Richardson says ""the hulls been breached"") didn't detract from this excellent Hellraiser Vs 2001 style flic. Watch it with the lights off and the sound up.

21 September 2008,Jacques98,1," Am I really the only person who thought this was the cheesiest movie of all time?
","I have a handful of friends who refuse to watch horror movies because they think they're all pure cheese. Event Horizon is definitely gives their argument some backbone. Here is one of the most acclaimed and said to be the scariest movies among horror fans, but when I watched it all I could do is chuckle. Event Horizon is cheese horror, and here is why: - The casting is horrible. The characters are not only all clichés, but they're clichés who can't act. They say some of the stupidest lines in the history of cinemalike, ""Look, a corpse-sickle!""and then act as if they've said the most intelligent thing ever. It's ridicules.",/review/rw1065721/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2013,Hey_Sweden,7," Creepy at times.
","Right from the beginning, it may be clear that ""Event Horizon"" owes a pretty big debt to ""Alien"" (but then, so do many other post-1979 films) but it does have a fairly interesting story and it does live up to the word ""horror"". It gets substantially unnerving and creates some wonderfully horrific imagery. In fact, as films of this type go, it's a pleasure in terms of the visuals - special effects, sets, cinematography. Devotees of these genres should find it to be solid if not exceptional entertainment. They may find the ""science"" ludicrous, but still be amused.",/review/rw1065721/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2005,poolandrews,5," Decent enough Sci-Fi Chiller that's a fairly entertaining watch.
","Some explanatory on screen text informs the viewer that the Event Horizon was a one-of-a-kind spacecraft designed for faster than light travel that disappeared in the year 2040 somewhere near the planet Neptune. We are then told that it's '2047...now'. Seven years after it disappeared without trace a source of transmission from the Event Horizon has been detected & traced to the orbit of Neptune. The Event Horizon's creator Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) is sent to investigate in a search & rescue ship called the Lewis and Clarke along with it's crew. The Lewis and Clarke is Captained by Joe Miller (Laurence Fishburne), his crew consists of second in command Lieutenant Starck (Joely Richardson), two engineers Smith (Sean Pertwee) & Justin (Jack Noseworthy), two medics D.J. (Jason Isaacs) & Peters (Kathleen Quinlan) plus a rescue technician named Cooper (Richard T. Jones). 56 days after leaving Earth they reach Neptune & locate the Event Horizon. They dock & Captain Miller, Peters & Justin enter the seemingly deserted spaceship. Captain Miller finds a dead mutilated body floating around & lots of blood stains on the bridge. Meanwhile Justin explores the engineering section of the Event Horizon where the core is situated, a piece of machinery which causes a sort of black hole to appear by which the Event Horizon is able to travel from any point to any other point almost instantly. Justin is sucked into the core & thrown back out again shortly after. In the ensuing panic & commotion the Lewis and Clarke is damaged, Captain Miller orders everyone on-board the Event Horizon to discuss the situation. It appears that the Event Horizon only has enough air left for 20 hours, Justin is alive but in a very bad condition & eventually tries to commit suicide by throwing himself out of an airlock. Captain Miller orders everyone to pull together, repair the Lewis and Clarke in time & make it back home safely. As the hours pass the team on-board the Event Horizon start to see visions, disturbing visions that are personally related to them. Searching through the Event Horizon's Captain John Kilpack's (Peter Marinker) video log they discover some terrifying & chilling footage that makes everyone in a big hurry to leave. Except, that is, Dr. Weir who appears to start & become possessed by his creation & isn't so keen on leaving her behind...",/review/rw1065721/?ref_=tt_urv
