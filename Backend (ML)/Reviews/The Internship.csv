","We've liked both leads in other movies, and we've been dog owners for close to 40 years, so The Dog Lover's Guide to Dating had a double draw for us.",/review/rw8783127/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2023,MichaelByTheSea,8," Rebecca Dalton is sweet and gorgeous in a movie that was way better than I thought it would be
","Movies that focus on dogs kind of cheat. Everybody loves dogs (or at least they should) and so viewers are already inclined to enjoy themselves when watching dog centric movies. But I've seen a lot of average dog movies including many on Hallmark (most recently, A Very Corgi Christmas). The mere presence of dogs can't hide a movie's flaws. But I was pleasantly surprised by this one.",/review/rw8783127/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,robby77777,10," Best Hallmark Movie of the Season!
","After being underwhelmed by Hallmark Christmas movies this year, I wasn't expecting much out of their first post-Christmas movie. I was wrong. Very wrong. This movie was well written, acted, and directed. It was thoughtful and never over the top and kept my attention for two hours. I thought the lead actress, Rebecca Dalton, did an especially good job in this very likable movie. Come to find out, she is the wife of one of my favorite Indy Car drivers, James Hinchcliffe. I think it was a very watchable movie that any dog lover will find enjoyment. Hallmark really did a nice job on this movie and I look forward to other new movies in 2023.",/review/rw8783127/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,pgibbons-83953,10," Low expectations, but high results! 10/10
","Listen, I'll be honest and say the previews for this movie did not excite me; however, both my husband and I ended up loving it! It premiered on January 1st, and was fun, playful, lighthearted, had great banter and chemistry between the leads, was energetic and entertaining, and was the perfect movie to jump start the new year. I don't typically enjoy dog training movies, but this one worked for me.",/review/rw8783127/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2023,Kenkeller-98-620553,8," Good could have been great
","I was looking forward to seeing this. Rated it an 8 out of 10. This is a low budget movie. Not much in the way of costumes or expensive sets. The premise was funny and the main actors were very good. The female lead was gorgeous, witty and articulate. The male lead was funny, but I had trouble understanding him in a few places because his voice was so low. The secondary actors were just okay. The dogs could have stolen the show but they were just props. I watched it twice just to make sure that I was being fair with my review. I am. One last thought, the lady the main male character is pursuing to date plays an outstanding self oriented, selfish designer who does a great job of being in love with herself.",/review/rw8783127/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2023,Jackbv123,7," OK
",I really like watching Rebecca Dalton and this is a good role for her. She is always upbeat. She is very easy to look at. She and Corey Sevier have decent chemistry if not sparkling.,/review/rw8783127/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,doggietracksnl,10," Great movie beautiful scenery
","This was a light hearted movie shot in a beautiful city. I found out that it was shot in Newfoundland Canada, although US flags are scene through the movie.",/review/rw8783127/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,galanosle,4," Better than I expected but ðŸ˜…
","It wasn't the best film in the world but it wasn't the worst ever
This film has good messeges but they are delivered to straight forward and they make them feel stupid",/review/rw8783127/?ref_=tt_urv
