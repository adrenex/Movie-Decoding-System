30 January 2011,colinrgeorge,4," Nothing Attached
","Romantic comedies need a good kick in the pants, and an aging Ivan Reitman ain't the guy to do it. ""No Strings Attached,"" the first of at least three 2011 films about non-committal sex (with ""Friends with Benefits"" and ""Hall Pass"" in hot pursuit), is only sparsely amusing and never insightful. Big surprise. Who would have guessed that a 64-year-old director would be the wrong choice for a movie about hip people half his age? ""No Strings Attached"" might have been a decent film had it followed through on its premise, but that it falls victim to just about every romcom trapping negates the most potentially interesting thing it has going for it.",/review/rw2435788/?ref_=tt_urv

","Well, this movie offers to change course of a relationship: usually, the couple meets, discovers each other and finally expresses their communion in an intimate relationship. Here, it's the opposite: they begin with intercourse and they want to achieve more. Well, this idea leaves me completely cold, as I don't want such experience. ",/review/rw2435788/?ref_=tt_urv

","Let us make no mistake about this film. It is a ten star chick flick. There won't be a woman with a dry eye in the house. But face it, ""Friends with Benefits"" was hands down a better movie. For sensitive guys, it is about 6 stars.",/review/rw2435788/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2011,jonnyhavey,7," Strings of Awkward Romantic Comedy
","Natalie Portman comes out of award season on top with her numerous Best Actress Awards for her performance in ""Black Swan"" including the Critic's Choice Award, the Golden Globe Award and an Oscar in the near future. Now she takes on the romantic comedy genre for the first time since her 2004 hit ""Garden State"". Her costar Ashton Kutcher on the other hand is no stranger to the romantic comedy genre with most of his recent films falling into this genre (""Killers"", ""Valentine's Day"", and ""What Happens In Vegas""). Together they create comedy through the awkwardly realistic chemistry between their characters Emma and Adam. Their quirky relationship begins when they are both sexually frustrated teenagers at summer camp. This leads them to becoming acquaintances throughout the early years of their relationship until they are thrown into each other's lives for the last time. Emma is a successful doctor who works eighty hours a week and is not looking for a relationship, while Adam is an aspired writer looking for a break working at a ""gleeish"" television show. Their latest encounter leads the two into a sexual dilemma as they make a pact to enter into a relationship with ""No Strings Attaches"" in other words no commitment, just sex. However, eventually the strings have to be attached.",/review/rw2435788/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2015,Prismark10,3," Not so great romance
","Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher have sporadically known each other since summer camp and every few years they tend to bump each other. Portman is a busy doctor. Kutcher finds out his ex girlfriend is now dating his dad, a former television star and ends up hooking up with Portman to have casual sex with each other without falling in love. In short a relationship with no strings attached.",/review/rw2435788/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2011,harry_tk_yung,," One wedding and one funeral
","Yes, one only, the wedding of the protagonist Emma's (Natalie Portman) sister that marks the conclusion of the movie. The funeral is at the beginning, all in the same family, of her father. While the title is as banal as can be, it aptly describes the essence in this rom-com. And you have seen it often enough, most recently probably in ""Love and other drugs"", someone with a phobia for close relationships. In ""Love and other drugs"", however, there is a good reason: a disease that will mean tremendous sacrifice on the part of the loved one. Here, Emma's resistance is not even explained with any particularly painful previous experience, and is therefore not too convincing. But never mind. This is not a logical-deduction whodunit mystery but rather a Valentine escapade and, as such, perfectly adequate.",/review/rw2435788/?ref_=tt_urv

28 August 2012,phd_travel,2," No chemistry between the leads
",The main reason this movie isn't good is that their is too little chemistry between Asthon and Natalie. Physically he is too big for her. In terms of persona they are too incompatible as well. They look like they could never hook up in real life.,/review/rw2435788/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2011,SteveMierzejewski,3," No acting attached
","The American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should give their awards conditionally. If you receive an Academy Award for best actor/actress, and then demean it by acting poorly in a subsequent film, you should forfeit the award. This is akin to behaving in a manner unbecoming a professional. Now, I wasn't a big fan of Black Swan, but I did think Natalie Portman deserved the Best Actress award. After watching No Strings Attached, I wonder if I, and others, had been fooled. Admittedly, she didn't have much of a script to work with here in No Strings. At best, her character was two dimensional. But then, she was one of the producers. You'd think she would have been able to tell a flawed script when she saw one.",/review/rw2435788/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2011,dierregi,1," Can't believe Portman is in this
","I always considered Natalie Portman as an outstanding actress and was surprised to see her name linked to Ashton Kutcher, notoriously a lot less outstanding. However, hoping for some light entertainment I decided to watch this movie. Regrettably, it turned out even worse than I expected. Portman plays a doctor who thinks she is tough, but in reality is just a hamster (the only funny joke of the movie). Kutcher plays a mild mannered guy, who has the misfortune of being weighted down by a questionable ex-girlfriend and by a vain, silly father. They both are supported by the usual cohort of unbearable friends who are a fixed showcase of all such comedies. The whole cast is equally intolerable and predictable to the utmost. If I ever saw a paint-by-number movie it has to be this one. Absolutely no way of spoiling it, as it is crystal clear from the start how it will end. I am still recovering from the shock of seeing Portman in this piece of unbearable s**t. But I learned my lesson and from now on I will try my best to avoid all movies with Kutcher in it.",/review/rw2435788/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2011,cosmo_tiger,7," A very funny chick-flick that both men and women will enjoy. Nothing new but still very entertaining. I say B+
","Can you really ever be just ""friends with benefits""? After a drunken adventure ends with Adam (Kutcher) naked on Emma's (Portman) couch they decide to strike a deal. When Adam wants something more the problems begin. This is a chick flick that many guys will also enjoy. A little more girlie then I was expecting, but still a really, really funny movie. The movie is pretty raunchy in some parts and you will find it difficult not to laugh. If you are looking for a chick flick that your boyfriend/husband will watch with you this is a great choice. If you are looking for a movie for your girlfriend/wife that will not be two hours of torture for you this is a great choice. Very, very funny for both sexes, enough romance for the ladies, and enough comedy for the men. A perfect movie for date night. A little predictable, but most romantic comedies are. I give it a B+.",/review/rw2435788/?ref_=tt_urv

26 January 2011,Marter2,7," There really are no strings attached
","""No Strings Attached"" works precisely for one reason, its script. Paramount Pictures, the studio backing the film, allowed the script to be R rated, meaning that ""grown up"" words, the ones that are four letters and need to be bleeped out from standard radio and television could be said. For a film that is about casual sex--one that tries to portray its characters as realistic--these words need to be included in the characters' dialogue. So, yes, thank you Paramount for allowing the script to be R rated.",/review/rw2435788/?ref_=tt_urv

","""No Strings Attached"", friends with benefits, and as they described it to their friends and family, they're friends who have sex. First there are the obvious jokes, ""Nope. That's not possible!"" But my problem with that set-up is that these characters—if they are even characters—are definitely not friends. ""Acquaintances who have sex."" Really takes away some of the potential, doesn't it? ",/review/rw2435788/?ref_=tt_urv

They end up falling for each other, tempers flare, and break up. Moderately dramatic event occurs that brings them back together again.

","I do not know why on Earth I ended up watching this pile of garbage or whatever it is, things were not easy.

20 September 2011,Sherazade,4," Maybe I've Seen Way Too Much of Natalie Portman Recently...
","I could barely get into the movie, let alone sit through it because I had a hard time buying Natalie Portman as the character she was playing. She's such an annoying over-achiever (and people rag on Kate Winslet for doing too much). Ashton Kutcher on his own was his usual self, not trying to out-act anyone or gun for an Oscar or anything. That coupled with the fact that this film seemed very similar to another terrible film I saw recently 'The Ugly Truth' starring Katherine Heigl and Gerald Butler. It's like we've run out of ideas and we're just coasting on the past ideas of others hoping something hits and works for the next set of coasters to come along and rehash our own copied ideas. The scary part is that this film was a hit people, so you can expect more like it coming to a theater near you sooner than you think. That said, I think Katherine Heigl should have played this role instead of Natalie Portman.",/review/rw2435788/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2011,OompaLoompa8816,8," Cute!
","I gave this movie an 8/10 simply because it will keep you laughing the majority of the time.

26 January 2011,ThomasMagnumPI,," a raunchy rom-com from the female perspective = interesting
","What is most fascinating about this movie is that it's a raunchy rom-com from the female perspective. Knowing that the film was written by a woman prior to my viewing it made the nuances jump out to me. It's those nuances and that perspective that make the film enjoyable. No one scene or moment merits more then a minor chuckle but the characters themselves expand and grow as the story unfolds. It's hard to care about the leads at first because there's no set up or real establishment of character. Then, they kind of grow on you even though neither really rang true for me in any real world sense. Natalie Portman is great as many would expect but Ashton Kutcher did a fine job as well. I've seen others criticizing his performance but I think that's based on a pre-determined hatred of him rather than on his work. The supporting characters were VERY weak and useless save for the father character played by the wonderful Kevin Kline. Overall, better than I was expecting it to be.",/review/rw2435788/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2011,Movie_Muse_Reviews,4," Overcooked attempt at ""with it"" sex comedy is too reliant on the formula
","No doubt about it folks, we are in the age of the R-rated sex comedy.  This explosive trend among movies stems from filmmakers and producers'  never-ending pursuit of making the rare comedy that costs little but  rakes in obscene amounts of money. ""No Strings Attached"" fits the exact  profile of a film quite literally strung together with the hopes of  getting its cup under the R-rated sex comedy tap and catching a few  precious drops of what has been comedy gold the last five years. And if  2011′s first romantic comedy is any indication, that cup hath runneth  dry.  Natalie Portman, the darling of Hollywood right now coming off her  Golden Globe (and what will likely be an Oscar) win for ""Black Swan""  and the somehow always-popular Ashton Kutcher co-star in what amounts  to ""Friends with Benefits 101,"" or a very rudimentary telling of how  two people come to and work through a decision to use each other  strictly for sex. Although no movie has highlighted this story line so  explicitly, most young people are aware of the concept, yet the film  takes us through the motions as if we're all 50-something and aren't  aware such progressive sexual arrangements exist.  That's why veteran director Ivan Reitman (""Ghostbusters"") proves  immediately to be out of place. He appears to have been handed  Elizabeth Meriwether's script and told ""this is what's popular now, go  do it."" Meriwether certainly didn't go out of her way to divert from  formula as ""No Strings"" overflows with plot-subservient supporting  characters (the roommates and friends of our ""not lovers"") and  injections of foul-mouthed humor, but a more modern comedy director  wouldn't have exposed those ploys as brutally as Reitman does.  The film takes us from the beginning of Adam and Emma's  acquaintanceship (they were never really friends before the sex  happened), which started at a summer camp when Adam attempted to mope  about his parents' divorce to Emma in hopes of a sympathy hook up.  Deciding to be frank, he asks to finger her. This is the movie's first  attempt at slapping in ""modern"" and ""R-rated"" sex jokes. Maybe that  would've been funny in 2005, but our over- exposure to dirty dialogue  in film has  and rightfully so  desensitized us to laughing at, for  example, any time the word ""penis"" or a variation on ""penis"" gets  tossed into a movie script as ""No Strings"" so often does. In fact, by  comparison to similar comedies, the movie hardly warrants an R rating.  As romantic comedy fans know, however, great chemistry in the leads can  help remedy even the worst of situations. To some degree, Portman and  Kutcher have something that works, but Adam and Emma are so poorly set  up that it slightly undermines Kutcher's sweet and surprisingly  sympathy-worthy performance and Portman's excellent ability to reveal  all her characters' inner thoughts and feelings. When they first have  sex, it should in theory be an enormous release of sexual tension for  the audience, but it feels as if it just happens for the sake of there  being a movie. That's the real problem with ""No Strings Attached"": as  genuine as the characters can feel at times, they all ultimately feel  like pawns of or cogs in a formula to deliver us a story. A good film  executes like a real-life or at least intriguing situation that the  audience gets to peek in on.  So like any film with an absurd amount of pieces, the characters  surrounding Adam and Emma either insignificant to us or we like them  but their screen time is completely short- changed. Meriwether would  have been better served to cut down on the amount of friends and  roommates and relatives and add dimension to the better of the bunch.  Among the list of those who deserved more attention are Greta Gerwig as  one of Emma's roommates, Lake Bell as one of the assistant producers on  the ""Glee""-type TV show Adam works for and SNLer Abby Elliot as a  bartender who does weird impersonations. Unfortunately, the most  intriguing supporting role, belonging to Kevin Kline as Adam's former  TV star dad who starts seeing his ex-girlfriend and loves drugs, falls  flat.  The lack of laughs and botched attempts at ""hip"" jokes, however, are  the root of the film's problems. After Emma gets drunk on tequila shots  one night after she and Adam have decided to sleep with other people,  she goes to Adam's place and finds him with two other girls whom she  proceeds yell at, calling them ""pumpkins"" for absolutely no reason. It  plays like a bad cut of improv, but Reitman seems to have blind faith  that that's what ""comedy"" is these days.  You'd really like to give credit to Portman, Kutcher and many of the  other actors who attempted to build likable characters despite how  processed they come across in the story itself, but ""No Strings  Attached"" never relents in its dependency on formula. We all know how a  romantic comedy will end (except 2006′s ""The Break-Up""), but when you  know how it will start and middle, that's busting the illusion that  fans of the genre pay good money to be fooled by. Sadly, the fact that  there's no disguising the film's attempt to jump on the sex comedy  bandwagon undermines nearly everything, perhaps even the bandwagon  itself.  ~Steven C",/review/rw2435788/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2011,albrechtcm,3," Ho Hum
","I was very impressed by Mr. Reitman's yeoman effort to make a four hour romantic comedy, but the tired premise, the routine scene changes and lack of empathy with the characters made this a dismal effort. Okay, it wasn't really a four hour film, but it sure seemed like it. I began yawning twenty minutes into the picture and when I was wondering just how much longer this could drag out I noted that only 37 minutes has passed. But being with my wife who loves anything mushy, I had to sit there and tough it out. The actors are all personable and I've always had respect for Mr. Reitman's work. But nobody hits a home run all the time.",/review/rw2435788/?ref_=tt_urv
