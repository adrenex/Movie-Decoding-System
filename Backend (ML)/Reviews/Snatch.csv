22 September 2022,travisdea,10," Absolutely amazing film
","This isn't going to be the big budget blockbuster, or art house indie garbage.made on the most modest budget and no marketingcampaign. This is a movie made for Veterans by veterans and it seats you into the very real crisis this world is facing. Suicide has become a plague among combat veterans and the issue truly has fallen on deaf ears to most that are asking for help. The work Nate and his team did to bring this film to life is amazing and I urge you to go in with an open mind. Now for the combat vets reading this look into MVP near you or the online forum the brotherhood is still there and we are waiting for you.",/review/rw8791769/?ref_=tt_urv

","Thank you for making this movie. Veteran suicide should be headline news every day. It was 22 a day in 2014 and still is today. There's just no way to describe the soul shattering that results from a family suicide. Losing my 27 yr. Old brother Elias who was from 2/7 Marines in 29 Palms to suicide was the closest to un-living I've ever gotten. I couldn't function in my daily life, work, or socialize normally for 3 years after it happened. Almost 9 years later, I've come to terms with his loss because of my belief he is still around me and my family. But I really believe his suicide brought me closer to feeling how he must've felt in the years after those 3 horrifying deployments. Powerless, helpless, alone and in deep pain that never seemed to end and was getting more complicated by the demands of daily life and relationships. If not for the help of loved ones during this dark depression I'm not sure where or who I'd be today. Thank you for making this movie and bringing attention to this epidemic and to the hope that lives in the community of veterans supporting each other. I really feel like that's where Elias felt he could be his most authentic self and live out his true purpose. The group of veterans and ex-athletes at MVP had the courage to show up for themselves and for their brothers and sisters and even more guts to show vulnerability. It was extremely touching and heartbreaking at the same time. Thank you for spreading hope.",/review/rw8791769/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2022,lfult-41455,9," A film with great heart
","I was lucky enough to see this at a Florida film festival. Based on a true story, it resonates for all that have to make peace with their past, good and bad, as life moves forward. Nate Aboyer does an amazing job as the writer, director and lead actor. He stars as a veteran (former Marine) against Mo McRae as the recently retired NFL star. The two cross paths and learn that both need to find a new purpose. It could be told in a very dark way but I think this is a film for most ages as it's a perennially story to either reinvent ourselves or find a way to fit in. This film has tremendous heart.",/review/rw8791769/?ref_=tt_urv

","As a retired disabled Veteran this hits home. Finally a fellow Veteran helps tell our story, our failures, nightmares and our struggles on a daily basis to fit in with society.",/review/rw8791769/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,timlabbe,10," An Absolutely Powerful Film
",Nate Boyer brings out both the ugliness of being a Veteran and the beauty of being part of a Brotherhood. What an absolutely amazing performance no doubt brought to life with his own personal experience. This is such a powerful story about what is going on all over the country with us Veterans.,/review/rw8791769/?ref_=tt_urv
