8 December 2022,DutchWatch21051,4," The end is a huge let down
","Such a shame. The acting is really spot on and right until almost the end we really enjoyed it. But when the curtain is drawn and the plot is finally revealed, the story is completely shattered. And as a viewer, you are left to wonder, it retrospect, what on earth you have been watching. The story, on a superficial level at least, is about a man going insane over his wife cheating on him with 3 different men. Of which one, he can't identify. But there's a dreadful suspicion. He is going through a severe crisis and he is immensely hurt by his wife's cheating. And as a viewer, you sympathize, how could you not, right? So, spoiler alert, she only cheated on him because he had cheated on her. And in the final episode, last 5 minutes, she simply confronts him with this. And he is just as amazed as you are as a viewer, because it makes no sense.",/review/rw8729620/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2022,durham100,8," I'm afraid I also suffer...
","...from a totally illogical dislike of James Corden. I have no idea why. And it's been going on a long time. Long before he sort of proved me right becoming all ffar too americanny and then with the omelette incident. I've never seen Gavin and Stacey so I have no idea what he was like in that. I just saw clips of car pool karaoke and things like that which made me want to kick my TV screen in. However, he is excellent in this, as is everyone. Melia Kreiling was wonderful in Tyrant and she is equally good in this and sorry, but i have to say, she is truly beautiful to the point of taking ones breath away. I love the storyline, the Coco Chanel thread which is bonkers but works and whoever chose the music throughout has to be greatly commended. This show is really DIFFERENT and it works. I get the feeling it is what Gervais was aiming for with afterlife - the feeling, not the story - and this shows how badly he missed after series one. I put off watching this due to my Cordenophobia - I heartily reccomend you do not do the same as you will be missing a treat.",/review/rw8729620/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2022,anna01010,9," An original take
","This is well-trod subject material, but the show is quirky enough to make it seem original. The character development isn't spoon fed to the viewer. It gives us a view and asks us to dig deeper. The acting was terrific. I don't understand the criticism regarding James Corden. He gave an accurate portrayal of the spurned husband, and Colin Morgan is always an understated treat whose brilliant micro-expressions flawlessly develop interest and depth. Sally Hawkins' ""Lue"" was this bizarre, otherworldly character which was done to perfection, and Melia Kreiling was both charming and dastardly in turns as ""Amandine"". This is one of those stories which sticks with you for awhile and I actually watched the last episode twice just to take it in again.",/review/rw8729620/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2022,GalAlba,6," Great Opening. Dark Comedy. It's Decent.
",I echo the surprise at the poor reviews. I'm guessing they're driven by Mr Cordon's media personality? But! If you dislike someone don't watch their work.,/review/rw8729620/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2022,galuwatra,10," Don't pay attention to the haters. It's great.
","This show grabbed my interest within the 1st five minutes. I can only surmise that the people giving a low rating are doing so because they don't like James Corden, for some reason. I am a huge fan of his & he knocked it out of the park. He is a brilliant comedic and dramatic actor. This show is heartbreaking , interesting & quirky. I watched without any expectations & was extremely pleased with the entire series. Every character's life, in the show, is messy & complicated. All of the performances were excellent. Ignore the bad reviews, this one is definitely worth a watch. I love any show that truly surprises me & this one certainly did!",/review/rw8729620/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2022,rosemaryandthyme,7," Better than I expected, Colin Morgan is great
","James Corden will always be Smithy from Gavin and Stacey to me and I did like him in that role. Then he moved to the USA, got his own show and went all ""Hollywood"". When I saw that he was starring in this new series on Prime I was going to give it a miss until I saw Colin Morgan's name. I held my nose and pressed play so I could at least watch Colin. I have to say it was far better than I expected. JC was ok (a more serious Smithy) and Colin didn't disappoint (a very different and cute role for him). The first episode hooked me straight away due to the small twist at the end. The scenery, countryside and homes were beautiful. The Tom Jones cameo topped it off.",/review/rw8729620/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2022,oyshalt,6," We forgot we live in a dream
","...obviously so did some other people making a futile attempt to review the series. It's quite interesting, and even ironic when observing how so many of us miss the point, getting caught up in the dissolution that things must be as they are presented in form, genera, concepts and even trivial things as our subjective opinion about the actors. I was very surprised by all the negative reviews, so I decided to give a shot at balancing it out with a more objective approach. I'm still in the process of wrapping my head around the dreamlike storytelling and symbolical nature of the series, but I believe we're dealing with a profound and deeply important problem that is rooted within our collective consciousness and culture. I really love the way they address this in an almost mythological manner, and delighted by all the hints that this is something far beyond a trivial comedy surprised . On the contrary, it's touching something way way deeper than we would like to admit, and I think this is intentionally made to make us feel uncomfortable. It's really brilliant when you start to get the the idea, and the biggest clue for me, was when, and in the context Amandine mentioned Albert Camus, and of course the whale and Moby-Dick references.",/review/rw8729620/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2022,starjosie,3," Every bad freshman poetry class come to life.
","As every, and I do mean every, positive reviewer laughably believes a negative review is due to a dislike of Mr. Corden, let me assure you I am barely familiar with him other from a few Carpool Karaoke episodes many years ago, which I enjoyed.",/review/rw8729620/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2022,richardkiddle,3," What did I just watch?
",I'm not going to waste time bashing James Corden. Suffice to say I watched this despite him and because I love Sally Hawkins. Sally is predictably good in this but rather wasted.,/review/rw8729620/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2022,vivnista,1," Self indulgent narcissistic nonsense
","The first epidode pulled me in, I mean, who doesn't love a bit of Tom Jones. Then it got weird and pointless. There is literally nothing to like about any of the characters. Not one thing. I either wanted to slap them or shake them. To be clear, I'm not talking about the performers, I have enjoyed them in other things, but the people they portray are so insipid.",/review/rw8729620/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2022,collincb,7," Don't believe negative reviews
",This is a really good show with really good acting. The plot line is excellent and has a nice twist at the end. I'm hoping they have a 2nd season. I think the negative reviews are because some people don't like James Corbin. Ignore them and give it a watch. I guarantee you finish the first season in one sitting. Watch this. It's good. Lead actress is very good as well. I'm eager to see what a second season will unfold as there is plenty of room for more seasons and character development. I read in one negative review that Corbin is a talk show host and not an actor. Well that person is unaware that Corbin has acted long before becoming a talk show host. Ignore the hate. Watch it it's great.,/review/rw8729620/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2022,megmerriet,10," Binge worthy, beautiful deeper meanings about love, partnership, and existence
","I don't think people should rate the show poorly just because they have mixed feelings about one of its actors. When I read an article talking about how this show provided a beautiful commentary about how monogamy can be at once essential and suffocating and it's allusions to Moby Dick and literature, I was surprised to see how low its ratings on IMDB were. I guess people don't like the male lead because of his offensive sense of humor??? That has nothing to do with this show. The writing is superb. The actors really create a spellbinding story. I watched this over the course of two nights because I could not look away. Amandine is tragic and mesmerizing. The pain of loving someone you can't trust is all too real for so many people, and this show delves into the magic of love and its horrors, drawing parallels between the sea and the unknown nature of another person. I LOVED IT. I am still trying to figure out the ending.... :\ but overall, I remain enraptured with this story. It has made me think more deeply about my former romantic relationships and how wonderful it feels when for a brief moment, you both believe in the impossible, that you and another person could love each other fully and forever.",/review/rw8729620/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2022,PlutoZoo,4," Momentary smiles can't undo depressing cringe.
","That this is painted by some of the suspiciously higher ratings as a black comedy strikes me as a stretch. I guess such opinions are from those types who would argue that a tomatoe is a fruit or that a blank canvas is art until you eventually throw them out of a moving car and provide them with the very demise they would call comedy, apparently.",/review/rw8729620/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2022,jgreco7,3," The whale is superfluous
","""We must believe in magic."" Crystal Gayle and William Shakespeare. ""It's not a robbery; it's a burglary."" ""Second Story Story,"" 1971, ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show."" When you steal, steal from the best. To be fair, there are good ideas in this recycled mishmash of comic pastiche. But to find them you must slog through six episodes of Woody Allen, Dudley Moore, Zach Galifianakis, and Gordon Ramsey. Comedy that teeters on tragedy is in vogue now. It's what, you know, the Bard dabbled in, evidently writer Jez Butterworth's inspiration here. And inspiration as well from manic James Corden, erupting on cue (his schtick). Butterworth borrows contemporary tropes, too. Passing wind in an elevator? That's how you do meet cute. Tom Jones and Moby Dick? They're both mammals. Trout Almandine? It's a French dish. Sally Hawkins is wasted as a dreamy sprite, imagining she's Coco Channel, falling for the actor who played Gavin opposite Corden, before he became popular in America. His character Jamie lives a kind of boudoir version of mad love with a maladjusted French woman. She could be Penelope from ""Baskets."" She is adulterous with three lovers. Jamie, only one. He's taken by her while at sea; they see a whale; he leaves his wife and marries her; they visit a seaside cottage (not enchanted); they see another whale, and Tom Jones; she miscarries and has affairs; he finds out and leaves her. In this tiresome amalgamation of comedy, tragedy, and fantasy, what Jamie learns, if anything is to be learned, is a lesson about adultery in the real world: it's what happens when you're human. The whale is superfluous.",/review/rw8729620/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2022,SurreyReviewsUK,3," Misses the mark
","It's not that it's badly written, more that it's old hat - partner finds other person has been having a affair, gets angry, shouts a lot and their life implodes. Some of the scenes are filmed nicely, and some of the dialogue is worked well(ish). Depending upon what you find 'funny' or entertaining' will dictate if you will like this. If you are a fan of American Chat Shows and the whole 'hilarity' out of the basics, then this is for you - not too taxing and the so called twists are very easy to spot from the start - brick in face approach. But if you like your entertainment a little less insulting on your intelligence (and ears caused by over dramatised acting styles) then give this a miss, it's not for you. As an aside I've read some reviews that seem to attack Cordon, not sure why, he is average in this so not sure what is causing some of the comments.",/review/rw8729620/?ref_=tt_urv

",Well I was decently gripped from start to end and I wanted to finish the whole series in one session. Nice and short at just 30 mins a piece so not a hard task. The acting was slightly over the top by Cordon but Hawkins was standout and the fantastical side plot drew me in.,/review/rw8729620/?ref_=tt_urv
