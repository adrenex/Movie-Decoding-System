","""Vampires"" is great popcorn entertainment. While fans will always compare Carpenter's later movies with his early genre classics, ""Vampires"" is excellent entertainment, even if it isn't an ""important"" or ""milestone"" horror event.",/review/rw0474799/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2001,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," If John Carpenter retired with Vampires, it'd be enough to call him one of the great masters of horror
","Why is this movie so appealing? I don't know how to answer this other than what I love about it: James Woods! Vampires is a movie brought to us by horror mastermind John Carpenter who almost gave up film making because he became disgusted by how Hollywood got so greedy. I'm so glad he decided to make Vampires because if not for his touch, I think this movie could have been really bad or bland. I'm very sad to say that Vampires seems to get overlooked or shadowed when people bring up great vampire movies a lot. I think because Blade was also released the same year, so it just got lost in 1998. However, I still love this movie, it's a western horror fright film that I'm sure will have you on the edge of your seat. A lot of people complain about James Woods being too camp in his rolesince when did that become such a bad thing? He's so awesome in this movie and really makes it exciting.",/review/rw0474799/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2017,claudio_carvalho,8," The Vampire Slayers and the Master
","The crusader Jack Crow (James Woods), Anthony Montoya (Daniel Baldwin) and their team are vampire slayers working for the Catholic Church under the command of Cardinal Alba (Maximilian Schell). When they find a vampire nest near Mexico, they exterminate all the vampires but their master Jan Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith) that is hidden below earth. Jack, Montoya and their friends go to a motel to celebrate with prostitutes. However, Valek comes to the motel, bites the hooker Katrina (Sheryl Lee) and kills all the vampire slayers but Jack and Montoya that flee taking Katrina with them. Jack has a meeting with Cardinal Alba that asks him to join another team. Jack leaves the meeting with Father Adam Guiteau (Tim Guinee) and decides to hunt down Valek using Katrina as a bait. Will they succeed?",/review/rw0474799/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2002,soralapio,8," Strangely appealing
","Ever since I saw a documentary on the making of horror movie special effects, I've wanted to see 'Vampires'. I wasn't disappointed. In this era of cheap computer effects it's really refreshing to see a movie where the special effects are done the old fashioned way. For some bizarre reason I really like Vampires. The plot is somewhat clichéd, the acting is nothing special and yet... I find myself watching this movie over and over again. Somehow the idea of a secret military force funded by the church, dedicated to fighting vampires is thrilling even though I'm not a religious man. I suppose it harkens back to the day of witch hunters. James Woods is great as the grim, dedicated man sworn to destroy all vampires and as the true shocker, the generic Baldwin appearing in the movie does a really good job as well! If you like gory movies, check it out!",/review/rw0474799/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2000,rparham,7," Flawed, but fun
","John Carpenter's Vampires is a flawed film, that's for sure.  It is not really terrifying, despite being billed as a horror film.  It is rather brutal, and the film's humor and the actions of the characters have been accused in some quarters of having a misogynistic bent.  So why is this film so much fun?  Two words: James Woods.  An extremely underrated actor, Woods is nearly perfect in the role of cocky Jack Crow, a renowned vampire hunter. He chews scenery with relish, handles his character's off-color humor with panache, and never lets up his colorful performance for one minute.  Is John Carpenter's Vampires art?  No.  Is it great filmmaking?  No.  Is it a good time at the movies with a central performance that will put a smile on your face?  You bet.  And, occasionally, that is enough.  Who says the B-picture is dead?",/review/rw0474799/?ref_=tt_urv

1 April 2002,poe426,10," Naysayers, take note...
","Who but John Carpenter would have the savvy to make a ""vampire western,"" and do it so well? His WILD BUNCH is a blue-collar crowd doing a dirty job, led by the cocky James Woods (whose wisecracking but nonetheless no-nonsense approach to hunting vampires reminded me more than a little of the early SPIDER-MAN- the one written by Stan Lee and rendered by Steve Ditko). And, just for the record, the movie IS better than the book. MUCH better. Carpenter manages to evoke a sense of time and place that seems to capture the FEEL of the southwest. The music definitely helps in this regard, but it's the director's filmmaking TECHNIQUE that makes this the almost ""spiritual odyssey"" that it is. When was the last time a movie made you feel you were THERE...?",/review/rw0474799/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2008,DarthVoorhees,7," It delivers what it advertises
","Vampires isn't a terrific movie but it is able to rise above and be more than just a B movie film about Vampires. The main thing separating this picture from that forgotten direct-to-video film is that it gets a better cast and director than it really deserves. John Carpenter may not be at the top of his 'Halloween' game but he is still able to do what he has all ways done best, create a heightened sense of fear and atmosphere. Vampires does have some blood and gore but it doesn't cover the walls,it's ability to use these fun and quirky characters is the draw. James Woods is that main character, Jack Crow. Crow leads a Vatican approved group of Vampire slayers who have met their match in the form of Valek, the very first bloodsucker. Jack's crew is brutally killed and he and his partner Montoya are the only two left standing. He rebuilds his crew with Katrina who is linked to Valek throuh a bite in her neck.",/review/rw0474799/?ref_=tt_urv

","I remember back in 1998 when this first was a poster at the local theater. I was interested but didn't think much of this movie at that time. I saw this on video, some years later. John Carpenter's ""VAMPIRES"" story is interesting, but it seems like there was just something missed in the overall picture. Although the places that they traveled to eradicate the 'nests' was very desert-Gothicism, in other words it was the place you would figure they would be. ",/review/rw0474799/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2004,m0rg16,7," Fade in, Fade Out
","I'm a big fan of John Carpenter. But in his latest films, I've noticed somewhat of a clumsy way he directs his films. It's almost as if the films were rushed and some scenes or even shots, just weren't filmed. He fades between all of his scenes... Sometimes, leaving us wanting more, but he just fades to the end of it. Sometimes, the scenes he uses could have been completly cut out and not used with the fade-technique whatsoever.",/review/rw0474799/?ref_=tt_urv

1 August 2018,lukem-52760,9," THE BEST VAMPIRE FILM EVER MADE!!! JAMES WOODS IS FANTASTIC
","Another EXCELLENT underrated Carpenter film!!! Ever since first renting this on it's first release on video i absolute loved it, went out & brought it straight away. JAMES WOODS is Fantastic as Jack Crow a very violent vampire hunter who leads a team of Exterminators who operate through Texas & Mexico & wherever needed really, to find the ""Nests"" of Blood suckers & Exterminate them. I love how Carpenter's team of tough Hunters have all types of Cool gadgets & weaponry & do their jobs like a bunch of everyday Exterminators, it's a unique approach to Vampire hunting in the Horror genre. Vampires is a sun drenched, moody & violent Horror flick & definitely one of Carpenter's most underrated films as it's totally entertaining, gory & funny.
JAMES WOODS is the best in the movie & one of my favourite Horror film characters ever.
WOODS performance is so much fun to watch & my favourite of his movies, Woods as the bad-ass mouthy & extremely violent, Jack Crow is definitely one of the best characters in the Horror genre in my opinion!!!
Jack Crow is tough as hell & very smart, Woods hammers the role with intensity & anger & he's excellent & should be up there with other Classic Carpenter Characters like Mcready, Plisskin & Burton.
The legendary Carpenter directs the hell out of his dusty western action Horror & gives us some Beautiful images of the lonely, desolate & rundown New Mexico landscape that's all tinted in popping reds & oranges & it looks fantastic, really Cool cinematography throughout. My favourite sequence from this superb Vampire movie is the exciting & thrilling opening scene at the old farm house where we first meet our team of Exterminators & my 2nd favourite is the Motel Massacre scene that is gory & action packed.",/review/rw0474799/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 1998,HankyP,3," I was soooo disappointed
","I went to a midnight showing of ""Vampires"" Halloween night. What a waste!! I should have seen Practical Magic instead. We had a chance to have a plot, but we didn't. We had a chance to find out what the difference between goons, vampires and Master Vampires was, but we didn't. We could have had character development, but we didn't. What we did get was James Woods acting like a complete a**hole and beating people up a lot. We got vampires being shot with bullets that didn't kill them and some gore. We got two extremely under-developed villains and a couple of under-developed heroes. It was almost like they shot a 5 hour movie and then started cutting pieces out of it until there was nothing intelligible left. I usually like John Carpenter movies -- but this was a real stinkeroo -- I gave it a three. **Edit** Since I wrote this I have been told that it was a ""wonderful"" movie, faithful to the novel which explained everything the movie didn't. I maintain then it was a good book, but the movie still sucked.",/review/rw0474799/?ref_=tt_urv

","John Carpenter's Vampires (1998) is very underrated vampire horror slasher action movie that I love it to death! This movie is so underrated and it doesn't deserve all the hate! I love vampire films and this is one of them, that I just love to death! Vampires (1998) is one of my favorite horror flicks. And I think with Prince of Darkness, The Fog and Escape from L.A is very underrated films, some people think it is just an Action Film some people think it is just an Sci-Fi film about Vampires. Well it is not! It is a horror film about immortal Vampires fight against Evil VS. Good. An Ultimate battle.

","What can I say?  I went to the theatre expecting a bad vampire movie and I got it.  First of all, I'm not partial to vampire hunters...the only great one has passed on (Roddy McDowall...aka Peter Vincent from ""Fright Night"") and all the rest are glorified religious nutcases who think that their way is the only way.

12 August 2020,Wikkid_Gamez,10," One of my favorites!...
","...And the only one of the trilogy actually directed by John Carpenter, that plus the entire cast making it the only one worth watching really... I absolutely loved this movie when it came out and it really has withstood the test of time for me. Extremely well acted, choreographed and put together. One of the few of it day that didn't romanticize the vampires, long before 30 days of night... It and From Dusk Till Dawn are up there as some of the first to show the more gorey concept of the vampire genre and for that they will always hold a special place in my heart. I guess there are just different types of viewers as I have seen many try and compare it to Blade, idk why... This is meant to be more of a horror, not a romantic, action movie... I don't care anything for the Blade movies. I like horror and science fiction so for me this was a good movie. I also saw a lot of comments referring to the treatment of the whore by the character Crow, well in my observation it has nothing to do with the fact that she was a woman or a whore, was because she had been bitten and he had an obvious justified hatred for vampires. He didn't start treating her harsh until she had been bitten, duh. The same goes for Montoya, as he didn't start favoring her until after he had been bitten as well, by her .... So from another woman's point view I do NOT find this movie ""sexist"" in any way.",/review/rw0474799/?ref_=tt_urv

31 October 1998,beerhunter,8," John Carpenter in top form with film ""Vampires"" (no spoilers)
","John Carpenter is America's greatest living director of westerns.  Although ""Vampires"" is his first literal western, JC's been turning out 1st rate original westerns from ""Assault on Precinct 13"" to ""They Live"" and ""Escape From New York"" to ""The Thing"".  Even though these movies don't take place in the west, they have all the ingredients of a good western: the lone hero/outlaw, the seige or attack, the showdown, and plenty of action. ""Vampires"" takes place and was filmed in the southwest (filmed in Sante Fe, NM).  Carpenter's DP Gary Kibbe captures some nice wide John Ford-ish western vistas, and Carpenter's minimalist score capture the desolate, hard nature of the place.  The real asset of this film is its cast, especially James Woods as the insanely tough and foul-mouthed slayer Jack Crow.  He really does some inspired improvised riffs, and when he's not kicking ass Woods has a lot of fun with it all.  Jack Crow is a classic Carpenter hero: all man, flinty eyed & completely alone, and Woods plays this unsympathetic character with such a quick wit you can't help but admire the guy.  Thomas Ian Griffith plays a great Valek, the master vampire whom Jack has sworn to slay.  Griffith plays the character completely straight, and it works extremely well.  Griffith is an imposing figure, and you get a real sense of the nobility & savagery of Valek's character.  Compared to Woods, Griffith underplays his role, but still commands a very real presence of power & evil.  Carpenter stretches the $20 million dollar budget well, but you can sometimes ""see the zipper down the monster's back"".  Despite a few fake looking wounds or rubbery stakes, Carpenter delivers a polished & stylish film, on par with movies costing 10 times as much (better in some cases).  I believe Carpenter works best with a little larger budget, but he should stay away from the typical Hollywood giant budget, he works best with a smaller production.  ""Vampires"" is a treat for any Carpenter fan, and hopefully marks the beginning of a new standard in his films.",/review/rw0474799/?ref_=tt_urv

",I liked this movie. I usually hate vampire movies but this one was very good. It was funny and tough and didn't have to resort to sub-From Dusk Til Dawn type mayhem that Blade did as it had a plot also. It's not too gory either. Sure KNB do some great make-up effects but it's not like the gore is the only entertainment of the movie. Blade and FDTD relied on the gore to entertain too often. Carpenter has made a Vampire movie that seems more realistic than that.,/review/rw0474799/?ref_=tt_urv
