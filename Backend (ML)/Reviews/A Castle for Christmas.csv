","Is it Oscar worthy? No. Is it just the right amount of cheesy for a Christmas movie? Yes. Worth at least once viewing, the rom com story is expected and heartwarming. The acting is decent enough and the leads have a surprising amount of chemistry.",/review/rw7586262/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,vintagegeek,9," Enjoyable Diversion
","Much better than most of Hallmark Movies for Christmas these days. Story is obviously predictable. But they do move it along. No long story chapter on do I or do I not buy the castle. It's just done. We love Scotland so it was fun to listen and give it the old ""we were there"" a few times. Cast is pleasant. Brooke Shields is still beautiful. Gary Elwes has aged well. Given it was shot while covid restrictions were full on they did pretty well.",/review/rw7586262/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2021,katefrichardson,9," BROOKE AND CARY ARE BACK!!!!
","Yes, it's a Hallmark-y type movie but it's SO much more than that. Cary and Brooke are brilliant. The Scottish scenery is spectacular (as always). The story is great and paced just fine. The supporting cast is so unbelievably sweet. There's enough comic relief to put a smile on your face multiple times as well, instead of simply rolling your eyes.",/review/rw7586262/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,toddsgraham,6," On the bonnie, bonnie banks Of Lock Lomond...
","Though predictable and formulaic, 'A Castle for Christmas' is entertaining nonetheless with some beautiful cinematography, appealing performances, and some lovely Scottish Christmas music and celebrations. From the snow-covered Scottish countryside, along with the beautifully decorated castle, to traditional Scottish dance and song, plus a cute dog named Hamish to boot, the film has a pleasing Christmas feel to it, which most will enjoy. The story follows Sophie Brown (played by Brooke Shields), a best-selling author whose most recent book has caused a bit of a scandal. After an on-air meltdown, she travels to Scotland partly to flee her readers' fury and partly to reconnect with her family roots. While visiting Dun Dunbar Castle, the place where he grandparents were groundskeepers, she meets Myles (played by Cary Elwes), the 12th Duke of Dunbar, who reluctantly agrees to sell the castle to her under the condition she lives with him at the castle for 90 days. And so, our story begins as we watch these two butt heads all the while embarking on a discovery that neither was expecting nor bargained for. The script is unoriginal but enjoyable. To be fair, one of the reasons why Christmas movies are so popular is because of their highly formulaic and predictable plots. We all need some comfort food from time to time. The dialogue and banter are pretty good. And though I did not have a laugh-out-loud moment, I did find myself chuckle a few times. There also were some touching movements here and there where I might even have shed a tear or two. The romance in this one centers on an older couple, as opposed to 30 somethings, which was refreshing. The script does a pretty good job of reflecting and highlighting this as well. The acting, overall, was excellent. Shields had an impressive performance as Sophie Brown. Elwes, who many will remember from the 'The Princess Bride', also had a strong performance. The chemistry between the two was great and, more importantly, convincing. Indeed, they had a nice back-and-forth (banter and comedic flirtation), which was engaging and entertaining. The knitters of Dunbar all had lovely performances too. And I can't forget Hamish, the dog who played matchmaker in this story. If you are looking for something warm and light, with a touch of Scottish holiday cheer, 'A Castle for Christmas' might be the Christmas rom-com for you.",/review/rw7586262/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2021,Siobhan7485,4," who the HELL are the Donatellis?!
","We accurately predicted a few of the main things that happen in this movie very quickly - like who the love interest of the main character would be and how the two characters (Myles and Sophie) would grow close. It is very cringey and predictable - Myles' dog takes an instant liking to Sophie even though very strangely ""he doesn't normally like strangers"" and Sophie remarks that she will have no reason to go into Myles' bedroom to which we said ""bet she does end up in there"". Lol.",/review/rw7586262/?ref_=tt_urv

27 November 2021,lisafordeay,6," I really enjoyed this film
","Brooke Shields and Cary Elwes star in this predictable rom com. Directed by Mary Lambert(who directed the original Pet Sematary) the synopsis is as follows. A best selling author named Sophie Brown(Shields) is going through a hard time since her divorce and decides to travel to Edinburgh Scotland to clear her head. From there she stumbles across an old castle called Dunbury that was once owned by a Duke. Sophie is so fascinated with the castle,she meets a disgruntled Duke named Myles(Elwes) who is trying to sell the castle. At first the two don't get along,but like in every rom com the two fall in love. Will Sophie and Myles get together in the end ? Well you have see the film for yourself.",/review/rw7586262/?ref_=tt_urv

","Nothing spectacular, your usual hallmark type Christmas holiday romantic drama. I did like the chemistry between Brooke and Cary, I would love to see them do more together in another type movie. The dog was super adorable! If you are in the mood for a hallmark easy watch I highly suggest it. Happy Holidays!",/review/rw7586262/?ref_=tt_urv

","Just what I needed - a truly relaxing enjoyable light hearted movie. It's romantically effortless and spontaneous; got me in the mood for the Holiday Season. Ms Shields has come a long way. She has perfected her craft with charm. This movie wouldn't work if not for the two leads - what a perfect pair. Also, this movie got me obsessing Castles.",/review/rw7586262/?ref_=tt_urv

30 November 2021,vivianla,," Scotland
","I loved the Scotland scenery and castle. An author named Sophie Brown gets bad reception for her book due to her killing off a character. She goes on the Drew Barrymore show. To get inspired for her next novel, she goes to Scotland to visit the castle her father worked for. The owner is sometimes rude. Sophie wants to buy the castle and due to their contract signed, she has to live in the castle. She meets new friends at the pub where they knit. She does everyone's hair. I love Brooke Shields's blazer outfits in this movie. Sophie and the man end up falling in love and he kisses her. They then go to the bedroom and it cuts off there.",/review/rw7586262/?ref_=tt_urv

",Guess I'm with the others who are asking why all the negative reviews. Maybe it's because my wife and I are solid Gen X so seeing these 2 stars in a feel good Christmas movie was great for an early Saturday evening.,/review/rw7586262/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2021,sinahaase-960-743497,10," Uhm Cary's ball outfit...
","Was like the best thing to look at in 2021. The movie was like a hallmark/lifetime Christmas film, but with 2 leads that people actually love. Brooke Shields is an amazing actress even in a corny movie like this! I'm giving a 10 because out of movies of this category (a bit of a corny Christmas romcom) it is definitely one of the best. Oh, and Cary's outfit for the ball though....it was shockingly handsome! Movies like this make me warm and cozy drinking my tea and enjoying my evening :) So if that's what you're looking for, this is a perfect choice. Enjoy!",/review/rw7586262/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2021,marmar13,2," Bad and Not in a Fun Way
","I watched this for Cary Elwes. These types of Christmas movies are always bad, but I figured he could make this one enjoyable. Nope. There's barely any chemistry between the leads, and there's basically no conflict in the movie. The crew must have realized this late in production because the writers shoehorn in some conflict by having Cary rage out for no reason near the end. There's also a weird moment where the camera focuses on two villainous people who never come up again. Then there's Brooke Shields. She's got one of those botoxy faces that can no longer express anything, and her character is one of the worst authors ever depicted on film. She can literally only write self-insert fanfic, and this has made her castle-buying rich. The supposed ""good"" story opening she comes up with at the end of the movie is absolutely laughable. One star for Hamish the dog, and one star for the hulking, silent gay knitter. The rest of this can go in the trash.",/review/rw7586262/?ref_=tt_urv

6 November 2022,lovemontana,8," I Liked It :)
","Was it cheesy, yes. Isn't that required in a modern day Christmas movie? I liked the actors being a little older than the usual 20 year olds in these kind of movies. I enjoyed watching these two find love again. I love both of these actors, and they worked perfectly in this story. I'm assuming the negative reviews were because of their age and not because of the story. It's worth watching in my opinion, The dog is adorable and the knitting club is a beautiful story of friendship. Don't listen to the cynics :) watch it and enjoy. I would love to travel to Scotland at Christmas and experience the beauty it has to offer!",/review/rw7586262/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,iris-45156,3," Oh my!
","Half a star for Hamish the dog, half a star for the William Morris wallpaper and two stars for the glorious castle and countryside, the rest meh! Smaltzy, predictable, awful dialogue and acting and indescribably stupid. A romantic author on a whim buys a castle without knowing about all the debts attached and the ancillary businesses for which she is totally unfit to run. Think of it as a train on tracks, first station, bond with the locals. Second station plunge in and buy the castle, don't bother with any relevant details. Three get the tartan, do up the house marry the Duke. Four write another best seller. Netflix at it's very worst even as a Christmas offering.",/review/rw7586262/?ref_=tt_urv
