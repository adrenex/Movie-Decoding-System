9 January 2022,haa4,10," Great start to the trilogy
","Best Hallmark movie I've watched in ages. Kevin and Lacey had fantastic chemistry and the script was so well written. It had female friendship, romance, and mystery of a magical veil. Everything and everyone mixed really well. And the ending set up the next movie in the series really well. Hallmark needs to work more with the Berg Sisters and Beth Grossbard because this was outstanding.",/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,debbiech,10," Precious movie
","This first movie of the trilogy is absolutely adorable. I smiled for the entire thing. Kevin McGarry and Lacey Chabert were fantastic together. They have great chemistry. A lot of laughs. One of Kevin's best roles. Having Alison and autumn appear just connects the whole trilogy. I recommend it. It's just a sweet little movie about legends, fate and meant to be. I recommend it.",/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,teresa_ramirez,9," Beginning of a great series, I hope
","I love all 3 actresses - Allison is a top-notch actress, Lacy is great in any role, love her giggle, and Autumn's acting seems so natural! I hope they make many movies together. The first in this series had an interesting storyline, humor that made me giggle and a nice ending to float into the next movie. The music, the locations, the costumes - all get a thumbs-up from me. The supporting cast was a refreshing change - they were smart & actually had something to offer to the story, instead of silliness. Even if they all get married in the end, this could be a long-lasting series!",/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hallmark has missed the mark with the majority of their movies in recent years, but has finally turned the corner and is back to making a few quality movies again. This is one of the best and starts 2022 on a good note, mainly due to the cast. The movie has a story within a story, which makes it more interesting than most Hallmark movies. It's also really enjoyable to watch. The acting, the scenery, the costumes, and the music are top notch.",/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,tkalstein,10," A beautiful movie!
",Kevin McGarry and Lacey Chabert gave us a truly romantic and beautiful movie. Their on screen chemistry was great and they showed us that two people can care for others and their needs more than their own desires. Both were selfless people and cared for the common good. Every moment of this movie was pure enjoyment. Definitely one of Hallmarks all time best movies.,/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,mrsacos,10," Perfect Hallmark movie!!!
","This story is beautiful, women supporting women, all the classic and lovely Hallmark tropes, perfect lead couple pairing, the chemistry is natural, lots of comic relief, with the right amount of drama, the couple actually dates before they get married! Hallmark nailed this one!!! 100% feel-good!!!",/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,ele117,10," Amazing!
",This movie was well written and the depth of the storyline. Lacey Chabert and Kevin McGarry played off each other brilliantly. I enjoyed their playful banter throughout the movie! The appearances by Autumn Reeser and Alison Sweeney's characters were placed perfectly. I can't wait for the other 2 movies in the trilogy!,/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2022,cgvsluis,8," Weddings are romantic and so is great chemistry!
","This is the first of three romantic movies set around an antique Italian lace veil and the three friends played by Alison Sweeney, Lacey Chabert and Autumn Reeser. The three friends met in college during grad school and each has picked an occupation around art. Alison's character auctions art in New York, Autumn's character researches art at a university in Chicago and Lacey's character works as a curator in a museum in Boston. To maintain their friendship the three friends have a once a year weekend together in a different town to go antiquing. It was during one of these weekends in San Francisco that they find a beautiful Italian antique veil. The proprietor of the antique shop tells them that the veil has a legend...whoever is in possession of the veil will find their one true love.",/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,sjswen,9," Surprisingly Really Good
",I have read the books that this trilogy is based on. I had heard that the movies were not following the books so I wasn't sure how good the movies would be. Well surprisingly I loved the first of the trilogy!! Lacey and Kevin had great chemistry and did an awesome job in their roles. The story was well done. Even though it was vastly different from the book it was based on it was a very good story and still held to the basis of the book.,/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2022,PeriodDramaFan88,9," Delivers
","This movie has what all ""made for tv"" romance movies need, a couple with good chemistry, well acted, witty, with a feel good/happy ending. Definitely worth a re-watch.",/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,karin-94993,10," Witty and romantic
","This was such a heart warming story. Loved the dynamics of the ladies' friendship and that bond, but my favorite was Kevin Mcgarry! He played his part perfectly. Wished they would've made sure he used that Bostonian accent from the first scene or done away with it all together....only thing I would change. Kevin and Lacey have the perfect chemistry and love the fact that we got a wedding and reception, and that it didn't end with them just falling for each other.",/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,teresawhitehead-66163,9," Perfect Romcom for a Saturday Night In
","Chemistry matters and Kevin McGarry and Lacy Chabert have chemistry. Add in a mystery veil, beautiful location, and best friends who happen to be Alison Sweeney and Autumn Reeser and you have a can't miss romcom. Great supporting actors and storylines, especially loved the mother/son dynamic and how Peter's first thought was to take care of his mom after his father's passing. I definitely recommend this feel good romantic movie!",/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2022,Sergiodave,7," Very Enjoyable
","An ingenuous way of making a romantic trilogy. Don't know anything about the books on which they're based, but the first movie had a good plot and was well acted. Looking forward to the next one.",/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,JCheartie,10," Perfection
","From the opening credits I knew this was going to be an above average Hallmark production, and it only continued to get better and better. The casting of the lead characters is perfection! They have chemistry from their first meeting all the way to their last kiss! Their banter and flirting was delightful and even their misunderstandings was loving and respectful. Then you have the beautiful filming locations and their wardrobe was exquisite! Lacey Chabert is truly the Queen of Hallmark and she has found her King with Kevin McGarry!!!",/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,sargemanley,10," Wedding veil happiness
",Thus is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. I love Kevin and Lacey. They have great chemistry and I would like to see him in more movies like this or even his own show.,/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,taylornan0909,9," I loved this movie BUT

9 January 2022,mhuether-10998,10," Better than good!
","I expected this movie to be good. It was better than good! It was great! I enjoyed the banter between the leads, the costumes, and the scenery. I already have another watch party coming together to watch a replay this afternoon.",/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2022,rhonnie-43139,10," Good start
",I really liked this movie. The story was good and the dialogues were well written. I liked the relationship between the female characters - they are very supportive of each other. The male lead was good - believable.,/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,cwmaranatha,10," BRILLIANT!!!
",The Wedding Veil is a gem of a movie. I love the bond of friendship among the three women as well as the beautiful love story between Avery and Peter; their relationship was so beautifully done that the emotions from both Peter and Avery were palpable as the love blossomed between them. Overall the acting was brilliant and the chemistry between Lacey and Kevin was strong making their love story that much more real and beautiful to watch. I have already watched this movie 7 times and I will for sure be watching it again!,/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,gegrossen,10," Amazing scenography and performances by both lead characters
","A wonderful love story with incredible performances by Kevin McGarry and Lacey Chabert. I enjoyed the whole movie and specially found the end to be a perfect way to weave the first movie's storyline onto the next 2 movies. Peter, played by Kevin McGarry is a sweet romantic character played beautifully by McGarry and Avery is a perfect optimist believing in love. I highly recommend it !!!!",/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2022,Jackbv123,8," Upbeat and sappy
",I like the idea of bringing 3 of Hallmarks recurring leads together for a series of 3 movies in which I assume they will all appear in each at least some.,/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,aprilskau,10," A Great Story
","I felt like The Wedding Veil steered appreciatively away from the usual Hallmark formulaic story line, making this a wonderful story to watch. Actresses who are such masters of their craft played their roles to perfection. The male lead, Kevin M, used such a well-done Boston accent that I almost forgot it was him. Lacey Chabert, playing the first friend to take on the veil and its charms made perfect sense. I enjoyed this movie so much that it made me want to visit the museum that is central to this subtle love story. Thank you to all who brought The Wedding Veil through production. Other than Hallmark's cheesy ""Lovuery (misspelling of a word that doesn't exist, sorry) advertisements, my evening was perfection.",/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2022,FormerHeartie,9," Charming story with stellar cast
","This first installment of the Wedding Veil trilogy met and exceeded expectations! The casting was really on point with the three strong leading Hallmark women (Lacey Chabert, Alison Sweeney, Autumn Reeser) and hearthrob, Kevin McGarry, as Lacey's love interest. I really loved the fun and flirtatious dialogue between Peter and Avery as well as the beautiful locations and the wedding veil as the springboard to the storyline. It was a really great balance between showcasing the strong and supportive friendship between the three women as well as the growing love between Peter and Avery. There was of course, the classic Hallmark miscommunication which kept Peter and Avery's relationship from taking off (this one particularly drove me crazy as Peter appeared a bit bipolar at times) but I could forgive that as the other parts of the storyline were so entertaining. The mystery with the painting and the drama to get it restored on time as well as the museum setting really enhanced the story. I also loved the supporting cast (Fiona Vroom as Lucy in particular). Lacey Chabert was so wonderful and she did well in choosing Kevin McGarry as her leading man - so much chemistry between the two! Honestly, I was thrown off by Kevin's boston accent at times (""Where do I pahk the cahr?"" lol!) but only because I'm not used to it and I think it was only a minor distraction -he did an awesome job. He is always so handsome and so, so charming. The ending to transition to the next Wedding Veil movie was clever and I eagerly await to see Autumn Reeser's story in Italy. Bravo to all!!",/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,fkpnjddm,10," One of the best I've seen lately
",Absolutely adore Kevin and Lacey together Loved this movie and will definitely keep it in my recorded favorites to watch over and over again Can't wait u til #2 in Italy.,/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,omaofc,10," Beautiful Romance
","I so enjoyed this movie. Kevin and Lacy were perfect in their rolls. The storyline around the veil was so nice, too. I have no idea why the one bad review, other than not liking an actor or something, but the other reviews were spot on. Nothing beats a sweet romance, especially when the two lead roles have the sweet chemistry to go with it.",/review/rw7738204/?ref_=tt_urv
