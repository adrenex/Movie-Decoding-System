","It was 2006 when director Mike Flanagan first caught our attention. We  obtained a copy of his short, Oculus: Chapter 3 and were one of the  first internet reviews of the short (a favourable review in case you  were wondering). We kept our eye on Flanagan through the years through  his follow up projects, Makebelieve (2000), Still Life (2001) and  Ghosts of Hamilton Street (2003). But it was Flanagan's 2011 film,  Absentia, that really put the budding director in the limelight.  Absentia was a small yet ambitious project that did its best on the  festival circuit before getting some attention on VOD and DVD and was  Killer Reviews' pick as the best horror film of 2011. Flanagan is back  behind the camera with Oculus, a picture that was picked as one of the  Elite 10 of the Toronto International Film Festival's Midnight Madness  Series.  Oculus tells the story of Tim and Kaylie Russell (Brenton Thwaites,  Karen Gillan). Tim has recently been released from a mental institution  where he spent most of his younger years after he and his sister  witnessed a deadly family tragedy that left Tim's psyche in a state of  fragility. Only hours removed from the hospital, Kaylie convinces Tim  that a mirror procured and displayed at the Russell household was the  cause of their violent childhood. Kaylie is convinced that the mirror  has a 300-year history of death and destruction and she solicits Tim's  help in an attempt to confront and destroy the evil that possesses the  antique mirror.  Kaylie and Tim's attempts to find answers and draw out the evil lead to  violent hallucinations and flashbacks that both siblings in danger and  challenge the sanity of the recuperating Tim. As their night alone with  the mirror draws long, Kaylie and Tim soon learn that the mirror is  still the dominant force and their attempts at closure soon become a  race for survival.  If Absentia was Flanagan's Star Wars, then Oculus is his Empire Strikes  Back. A better more polished film, Oculus was as eerie and involving as  it was particularly complex in its non-linear storytelling. Much like  Absentia, Oculus is intelligent in its unravelling and doesn't cater to  the microwave generation's want for a high body count while still  delivering the goods.  The acting was stellar with familiar faces Rory Cochrane (CSI: Miami)  and Katee Sackhoff (Battlestar Galactica) complementing the adult  Gillan and Thwaites). But is was the performance of the younger Kalie  (Annalise Basso) that steals the movie with a virtuoso performance that  demonstrates the young actor's range.  Horror fans that have longed for a good and clever thriller involving  ghosts and the paranormal will have their thirst quenched with the  smoothness of a 12-year-old Scotch. Oculus is everything we could have  hoped for from the no-longer-unknown Flanagan.  It is a superior thrill ride that will challenge audiences to keep up  with the fast moving plot developments while delivering upon an onion  layered type screenplay that will keep your guessing not only in what  happens next, but if what is happening is even real.",/review/rw3075090/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2014,samlynn12,9," Best horror film I have seen in a while
","This film was fantastic. I was creeped out the entire time, right from the introduction of the mirror. There has always been something slightly disconcerting about staring into a mirror at night, half expecting someone to jump out from over your shoulder. This film captured the essence of this perfectly. There was not a lot of action, not much blood or violence, but just enough to scare the audience. Just when you think that you have the mirror figured out, something else comes around to make you think otherwise. It makes you wonder if the characters are just crazy, that none of the film is actually real. You will never know exactly what is going on. That is what made it such a well done horror film, backed up by great acting performances from both adults and children. If you enjoy horror films as I do, go to see this film, you will not be disappointed!",/review/rw3075090/?ref_=tt_urv

1 May 2014,hugorocksmy,8," Twisted Story with Excellent Performances
","Even though it wasn't as scary or gory, as I wanted it to be. It still managed to creep me out and get on my nerves, with it's very creative and elaborate story and excellent performances from all it's cast. I really enjoyed the chemistry between the two younger actors played by Annalise Basso & Garrett Ryan, and the relationship they had as characters, which added a lot of heart and sentiment to the whole story. Moreover, this movie was more a drama with some horror, because it didn't played with the whole scare and gore factors, but instead it was more about the the story behind the mirror and the effect it had with the people that surrounded it. It would be a good idea to make this a franchise because of how extensive its universe could be, as well as how many different stories and characters it could incorporate and continue to haunt, even though it's ending was melodramatic to me, it felt conclusive and eerily heartbreaking. Overall, it was a very good little drama-horror film that goes more farther than you could imagine and think.",/review/rw3075090/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was really not that bad for a horror movie. The whole mirror monster sort of thing has been done before but what made this movie refreshing to me was the complete mind trip that was going on throughout the movie. I spent more than like 3/4ths of the movie utterly confused yet it made sense by the end. It was all over the place but slowly, I was able to piece things together. I personally thought it had the right amount of horror that it was actually able to make me jump at some parts without being too cringe worthy like most horror films are. Also, I was impressed with what was done despite the simplicity of the film. Tons of thrills, tons of fun. Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this.",/review/rw3075090/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2015,williambendavis-933-218958,9," An extremely well put together film
","I really loved this movie. I thought the filmmakers handled this movie very intelligently and brilliantly. They put a strong emphasis on building a super creepy atmosphere rather than focus on pointless blood and gore. Because of this, you're on edge pretty much the whole time. I can't say it's the scariest thing I've ever seen, but it was certainly nerve wracking throughout. The plot of the movie revolves around a brother and sister trying to prove that this weird mirror is haunted and is responsible for many deaths over the years, including their father's death. This mirror makes you see things that aren't really happening and it screws with your perception of reality. It makes the main characters kind of lose it mentally. The film loses structure and coherency as the the character's minds deteriorate, and that isn't a bad thing at all. It adds to the movie really. I thought the correlation between their state of mind and the film's structure was pretty cool. Also, the child actors in this movie are fantastic. They were never annoying and the way they acted like normal children (for the most part). That being said, it isn't flawless. You could watch this and completely hate it. I could definitely see the overall confusing narrative turning people away. It's a fairly subjective movie I think. You could love it or hate it. That being said, I personally loved it and I think people should see it.",/review/rw3075090/?ref_=tt_urv

18 August 2014,KineticSeoul,8," Cleverly constructed and edited horror film
","This is a cleverly constructed horror film that does not depend on gimmicks or gory exposure to get the audiences to pay attention. Instead, it's has cleverly storytelling, cinematography and unique scenarios. It's a movie that is thrilling, captivating and intriguing. And this is a film that does a really good job of building up the suspense when it comes to the horror elements. It has unpredictable twists and turns that not only delves into the ghosts but inner demons and psychological turmoil as well. Also nothing about this movie seemed forced or seemed to try hard to try to frighten the audiences. Overall this is a horror flick that kept me focused and made me care and put effort into finding out what exactly is going on. Watching this film was like watching a really good horror puzzle movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this one and recommend it to anyone that enjoys horror movies. Sure, a lot of horror movies has elements that has been overdone and uses the similar tactics over and over again. Plus it's one of those genres that doesn't take much to make. However this still brings something new to the table.",/review/rw3075090/?ref_=tt_urv

","I cannot believe that people are giving this movie low ratings. As an avid horror movie fanatic,it takes a lot to freak me out in a movie and this movie not only disturbed me it stood out to me.This movie is based off of psychological mind tricks and you will feel as if you are being deceived by the mirror.This does not get its horror based off of cheap jump out scares or gore, it messes with you so you no longer know what's real and what's not. While the ending was very abrupt,I love how the whole film mirrors itself in the past and that the two story lines interconnect.This may not be for everyone, but I can say that this movie is psychologically terrifying. This generation is used to over used gore and predictable horror, but this movie is different than that. Despite what others say it is not just another scary movie. I left the theater afraid after all of the illusions the movie pushes you through. It is slow, yes, but it is full of suspense and the slow dread adds to the plot. I bet the people who rate this low are into the shock factor and gore of other horror movies. Give it a chance.",/review/rw3075090/?ref_=tt_urv

Hollywood has just become to commercialized, too calculated, and to conveyor belt-like in its approach to horror.

","21 year old Tim Russell is released from a mental institution.That same week his older sister is able to get a few days alone with the Lesser mirror. Kaylie, the sister, decides to take the mirror back to their old house, where unspeakable horrors unfolded during their childhood shortly after they moved to the back-then-new-house, and their father bought the infamous mirror. Kaylie is convinced the mirror is haunted: the mirror being some sort of evil supernatural being. Tim, on the other hand, has grown completely skeptic about the supernatural aspect of the mirror, believing his sister only holds on to that notion simply to have a way to cope with the horrific events of their childhood. Needless to say, the mirror does seem haunted, and as the night progresses for the adult siblings, the door to those memories open up, revealing more and more those events which both are trying to move on from; albeit in very different ways. These two timelines (their childhood and their present-day adult selves) unfold in a parallel manner, with the ending of the film culminating the two timelines' climaxes together.

28 April 2016,Quinoa1984,7," messes with your head, until it doesn't, but a good movie
","You know what makes Oculus stand out? That scene about 20 minutes in, maybe more or less, when we're seeing a particular flashback with the father (played by a stone-cold Rory Cochrane, kind of underrated in general and does well here), where he has a rather irritating finger problem. He bites his nails, but this one seems a little more... unwieldy. He takes a pair of pliers to take off a band-aid around his finger that he put there due to the finger bleeding too much. He finally pulls off the band-aid and it hurts like a SOB. And it turns out he actually pulled off his own fingernail (or most of it), and it necessitates another band-aid. Will he need more? Very likely if he stays in that room he's set up as his study with that damn mirror.",/review/rw3075090/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2014,jaguiar313,8," Smart, inventive and often very scary horror from Absentia's Mike Flanagan!
","I am a big fan of Mike Flanagan's low budget chiller Absentia so, I was very much looking forward to his next flick. And Mr. Flanagan didn't disappoint. Supernatural horror starts out introducing us to two siblings, Kaylie (Karen Gillan) and Tim (Brenton Thwaites) Russell. 11 years ago a horrible incident occurred in their home leaving their mother, Marie (Katee Sackhoff) and father, Alan (Rory Cochrane) dead, with 10 year old Tim incarcerated in an institution. From appearances, Alan murdered his wife and Tim killed him in self defense. It's over a decade later and Tim has just been released and his older sister has come to help him get back on his feet and destroy what she claims is the real culprit in their parents' deaths. After years of treatment Tim sees the murders as a simple case of domestic problems and negative emotions gotten out of control. His father driven to torture and kill their mother and he, forced to defend himself and his sister by killing their dad. A tragic but, rational explanation. Kaylie believes it to be the influence of a demonic entity that lives in an antique mirror purchased by their father for his office. While Tim was away, Kaylie has been planning to prove her belief, once and for all, and has tracked down and procured the mirror through her job as an antiques dealer and brought it to their still vacant former home. She convinces Tim to join her on calling out and destroying the sinister force that she believes, from her research, has left a trail of bodies and tortured souls for over 100 years. Is Kaylie delusional and in need of treatment herself, or has Tim's treatment created a more practical way of rationalizing an even more horrible truth? Director and co-writer (with Jeff Howard) Mike Flanagan crafts an intelligent, inventive and really creepy horror film that certainly has it's share of out-right scares, especially in it's last act. But, much like his spooky Absentia, Flanagan never bludgeons us over the head with the horror and thus keeps it effective by keeping us from getting numb to it. As with his previous flick, he doesn't give us everything at once and plays with our heads for a bit as to whether Kaylie is creating a supernatural fantasy to avoid the realities of the domestic horror she witnessed or, is Tim candy-coating the nightmarish truth with the psycho-babble fed him by his doctors? The film is a moderately paced but, constantly unnerving and creepy build-up as the siblings delve deeper into the events that occurred over a decade ago and Flanagan who also edited deftly mixes in flashbacks to those horrible events and seamlessly blends them so that at times they all seem to be happening at the same time and in the same space. It's really disturbing as we try to figure out if these two are finally reliving and facing what happened, or, is there an evil presence in that mirror that is happy to make them experience again the memories that torment them most. It's in the last act where the full truth is revealed and I will say no more except to be ready for the film to deliver the goods when the time is right. It's an intense and scary ride Flanagan takes us on to get our answers, made all the more effective due to the skilled and disturbing build-up by a director who makes good on his potential. Again, Flanagan also has an underlying theme about the effects traumatic events have on a our lives. With Absentia it was the emotional effects of a missing loved one and not knowing their fate. Here it is growing up and living with the trauma of witnessing domestic abuses and violence. He weaves these into his story subtly so they are not intrusive to the plot but, they are there. And that is one of the things I like about Flanagan's work and especially with this film, he knows when to be subtle and when to get intense and he does both here to maximum effect. Sometimes less is more and Flanagan's instincts are good at knowing when to feed us an underlying creepiness and when to outright scare the pants off us. It's what makes Oculus work so well and made Absentia such a treat. He knows what degree to feed us the films elements and when. He is also clever with his use of the traditional elements so, they appear fresh. The director also gets good work from his cast with Gillan and Sackoff really standing out here with strong performances but, the acting is solid all the way around. No one ever goes over the top even when the film is in full scare mode, the performances stay grounded and thus more effective. He got good work out of Katie Parker and Courtney Bell (who has a cameo) in his last film and seems to have a knack for writing and directing strong female characters that aren't stereotypes or caricatures. The film is not perfect, but, it's flaws are very minor and I loved that when the blood does flow, it was practical effects as did a lot of the make-up and effects seem to be. If digital was used, it was excellently rendered so it was not noticeable which, in a film like this, is the way should be.Overall, I really enjoyed Oculus and how it was equally effective in it's subtle moments as it was in the more intense ones. It never overloaded you with plot elements or the horror elements and fed you the answers to it's mysteries gradually so it held your attention till it was ready to let you have it.. and the final act does exactly that. A smart, disturbing and sometimes downright scary horror from Mike Flanagan. Also stars Annalise Basso and Garett Ryan as young Kaylie and Tim respectively.",/review/rw3075090/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2014,loomis78-815-989034,10," a Stand out cerebral Horror film that truly Scares
","Tim Russell (Thwaites) is released from an institution that has held him since he was 10 years old. He was accused of killing his Father (Rory Cochrane) who had killed his mother (Katee Sackhoff) in the family home. His older sister Kaylie (Gillan) meets him upon his release and plans to hold him to his promise he made the night he was put away. Kaylie and Tim believe the ancient mirror their father bought and brought into their home has an evil entity in it and is the real cause of everything that happened. Kaylie owns the parents' house now and has tracked down the mirror and put it in the exact same spot. She is clever if not a little off her rocker when she has the entire place set up to prove that what they saw as kids is real. Shaken Tim just wants to be better, years of therapy has washed away much of it, but he follows his sister in her quest into the supernatural. Told partially through flashbacks when they were younger, the treacherous mirror isn't the blame it's the entity inside. Kaylie watches it kill animals, plants, mess with temperature, jam cell phone signals and set an ominous presence in the house. Up and coming Horror filmmaker Mike Flanagan fresh off his low budget but excellent ""Absentia"", makes this film scary from start to finish. Even an early scene with figures at a museum under sheets is unnerving even though it is a bit telegraphed. Annalise Basso and Garrett Ryan as the young Kaylie and Tim are just as good as the two leads and this helps a bunch. Flanagan layers his story (Co-written with Jeff Howard) with scary bits but never makes the mistake of overplaying his hand. The mirror's entity is able to mess with people's minds and make them see what may not be there. The goal of the entity is to capture the spirits which it kills and hold them in the mirror. This makes for some unsettling moments with Mother and the kids. The flashback scenes are truly frightening as the entity slowly possesses the family's Father who eventually chains up the Mother in the room. Flanagan's pacing is perfect, and the end reveal is shocking and chilling beyond belief. The movie really captures the horror of the mind with the entity playing mind games up to the very end. Is this all real or not? The ending which leaves it open for another, is clever and never answers if it is all in their heads or all real. A classy, supernatural horror film that never forgets it is still a horror film and delivers scare after scare with some blood as well.",/review/rw3075090/?ref_=tt_urv
