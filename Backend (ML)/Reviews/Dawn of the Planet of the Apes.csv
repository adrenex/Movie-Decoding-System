22 November 2021,nancyldraper,9," Visually stunning
","Made by gamers (RIOT) for gamers, but, also, is a stand alone piece of art for people, like me, unfamiliar with the game, LEAGUE OF LEGENDS. The series is visually stunning in 3D and 2D animation with beautiful attention to detail. There is incredible world building, an engaging story line, music that serves as narration and a stellar voice cast. I give this series a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Steampunk Fantasy Adventure}",/review/rw7586796/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2021,stevebondi,10," Coolest animation style I have seen to date in any TV series or movie! :-)
","I am a newbie to the source material, but the first 3 episodes of this show blew me away! And, now having seen the whole first season, my rating remains even more solidly a 10! :-)",/review/rw7586796/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2021,Pairic,9," Great Steampunk Adventure
","Arcane: An animated SF/Fantasy Steampunk series on Netflix. In the cities of Piltover and Zaun there is unrest, Piltover the upper city literally looks down on and oppresses Zaun. We have gangs of thieves, rebels, steampunk Stormtroopers, magic melded with science. This is serious stuff with great physical and ""magic"" fights. Also a tale of two sisters falling out and Scientist/Mages battling against the conservatism of the Council who fear the unleashing of uncontrollable powers. It's set in the League Of Legends game universe. Directed by Pascal Charrue and Arnaud Delord, written by Christian Linke and Alex Yee. 9/10.",/review/rw7586796/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2021,djurrepower,9," Excellent, also for non league fans
","I watched it with my parents who don't know anything about league's universe. I have been playing league since 2010, So my opinion may be a bit biased.",/review/rw7586796/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2021,garabedian123,10," LOL is a video game right?
","I have heard of it but never played it. When i first turned this on and saw kids i immediately turned it off and sighed ""not another kids show"". But then i kept watching and realized this is not a kids show. It just has kids as characters. But wow it got dark and good.",/review/rw7586796/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2021,Tactrix,10," This is ART!
","Beautiful storytelling, great underline currents, and the emotion behind this is just amazing. The story is for everyone, but especially for League of Legends fans. The entire time I was watching it I was trying to piece together who is whom. And some of them are obvious but other ones really make you dig deep and see where they're trying to head.",/review/rw7586796/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2021,jasminn_tan,10," Wow!
","As someone who had never played the game before, this was a great introduction to its lore. The story was riveting and the pacing was perfect. And the amazing animation and soundtrack just enhanced the entire viewing experience. The VAs did an incredible job as well, particular the VA for Powder/Jinx.",/review/rw7586796/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2021,Tweekums,10," An animated sci-fi epic
","This animated series is set in the twin cities of Piltover and Zaun. The former is a utopian city where citizens have an easy life with access to all the latest technology; the latter is a dystopian, squalid underground city whose inhabitants struggle to survive. As the series opens we are introduced to a group of youngsters, from Zaun, led by a girl named Violet who enter Piltover and steal from a house belonging to scientist Jayce Talis. Violet's little Sister, Powder, takes several glowing blue crystals... as they flee the scene she drops one and it explodes destroying the building. The group are now hunted, and following her loss of other items Powder is considered a Jinx. In what follows we are introduced to more key characters; an underworld crime lord named Silco; Caitlyn Kiramman, the daughter of a city councillor who later joins the Enforcers (Piltover Police) and Viktor; a young man who works with Jayce in his investigation of finding practical uses for magic. Over the course of the series there will be changes in characters as events impact on them and dynamics change.",/review/rw7586796/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2021,Harun_Karali,10," Brilliant Writing is Pushed to the Stratosphere by Masterful Visuals
","I feel like it's fair to say that it's difficult to adapt anything to the silver screen/TV these days, not that there hasn't been plenty of movies/shows that have tried and failed. But Arcane is proof that it can be done, and be done exceptionally well. By the time you reach the season finale you can tell that the ending was thought out from the start. Even giving depth to the villian Silco who seemed two dimensional at the start, but growing to care and love a little girl, showing that even the darkest soul can have a heart. It has been a long time since I've been truly impressed by a series(animaton or otherwise) and the fact that it came from out of nowhere makes it all the worthwhile. The amount of work that went into the details is outstanding. This is an animation that Riot Games and Fortiche Productions can be proud of.",/review/rw7586796/?ref_=tt_urv

7 November 2021,jhuebel,10," Not A League of Legends Player, This is FANTASTIC
","I'm not a League of Legends player. In fact, I know almost nothing about it. But this show is fantastic. To say that the opening scenes of the first episode were ""gripping"" is an understatement. I don't often start on the edge of my seat with a TV show-- animated or live action.",/review/rw7586796/?ref_=tt_urv

22 December 2021,kevin_robbins,9," The sister relation and storyline is compelling and the action scenes are awesome
",Arcane: League of Legends (2021) is a series my daughter and I recently watched on Netflix (season 1). The storyline follows a futuristic society where the haves and have nots are greatly divided. The underground has a strict code of what and when they do what but when a mission goes wrong by a group of children the underground comes down on them. The older sister blames the younger sister within the children and eventually deserts her leading to the split up of the gang. Years later the the older sister tries to find the younger sister but finds her world flipped upside down and a new leader of the underground has emerged aided by her sister...,/review/rw7586796/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2021,Master_Strange,10," Animation and Visuals Are Beautiful, From the Cities to the Characters
","What I especially enjoyed was how expressive the characters are. Character development is impressive for every single major character. Many of the characters are morally grey in a realistic way. Most shows are lucky to get a few characters that go through good character development arcs- in Arcane we get to see all the main characters develop and it's never forced or unrealistic. Overall, Arcane is a masterclass in world-building and character writing. This puts most other television shows to shame in the intensity and detail of its story, and will be remembered as a staple in the development and adaptation of modern fantasy for years to come. I'm really looking forward to season 2.",/review/rw7586796/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2021,kythia,10," Beyond belief - Netflix Show of the Year
","This is a piece of art, pure and simple. Every frame is a painting ready to fill a museum. The story, the characters, down to the little details. I laughed, I cried, and I wanted to be there for every moment.",/review/rw7586796/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2021,bbevis-47954,10," Fantastic
",I'm a big critic and it's hard for me to find any fault in the first two episodes I watched. Arcane is incredibly engaging and I've never played League of Legends. I would recommend Arcane based off the quality of the jaw dropping animation alone but thankfully everything else fits the bill. I highly recommend Arcane to anyone interested in fantasy.,/review/rw7586796/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2021,svederen,9," Not just for fans of the video game

24 June 2022,Neptune165,10," My favorite line in the show tho is Silcos monolog to Vander statue
","Arcane has a 100% critic / 98% audience score, highest rated Netflix show ever, number one in over 50 countries, already surpassed Stanger Things and the Mandalorian in online streaming numbers with just 9 episodes. This show deserve all the love it has gotten, I can't stop thinking about it. The craftsmanship and love they put into this show allows me to use the word ""masterpiece"", something I thought I would never say with today's media. Never heard such realistic and believable voice acting in my life. Every cry, every doubt, every tremble in her voice... Cuts straight through my friggin existence.",/review/rw7586796/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2021,DaegT,10," Best steampunk anime
","I would categorise it as a steampunk anime and I know even if it's not 100% correct, it won't be too wrong. At this moment there have been only 3 episodes available but I'm already overjoyed at the series. The plot, the pictures and the pace are all top-of-the-line. The trailers really didn't lie to me!!!!",/review/rw7586796/?ref_=tt_urv
