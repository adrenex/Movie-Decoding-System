17 February 2006,ccthemovieman-1,9," Emma Can Break Your Heart
","Wow, here's an emotional story that gets you involved and wears you out by the end. I wears you out not from action, but from watching two good ladies suffer heartbreaks one after the other. This is not my normal viewing fare but I am big fan of two things this movie has to offer: (1) Emma Thompson and (2) incredible visuals.",/review/rw0371027/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2007,kosmasp,8," Period drama
","I haven't read the book (yet), but concerning the film as it is, I can assure you that it is very well made. You'll get one of the best period dramas (I wouldn't go all the way with ""best ever"", but then again, I don't often use extremes to describe a movies) that you have seen!

7 September 2000,helpless_dancer,8," The agony of unrequited love
","What an excellent film! Superb performances, spellbinding dialogue, and beautiful sets and props led to an enchanting 2 hours of lost love and hope. I loved the stiffly formal, wonderfully polite, yet stifling mores these English were forced to endure. In many cases their lives were not their own to live; in many, their lives were lived under the gun of the almighty buck. They carried right on, however, with their characteristically stiff English upper lip, come what may. Great film with a knockout ending.",/review/rw0371027/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2017,ElMaruecan82,8," In the Name of Love, Marriage and Conveniences...
","If it wasn't for Jane Austen's novels and their screen-adaptation, we wouldn't be much familiar with the English gallantry and the bourgeois manners of the early 19th century. Her oeuvre encapsulated a time where women didn't have a way to go through life without landing on the ""marriage"" square, hardly an issue to please feminists but who would call Austen traditional or submissive for all that? She respected the conventions but made powerful social commentaries in the indirect sense that her female protagonists never married someone they didn't love. Marriage was the end, but love was the means to achieve it, while marriage of convenience was the privilege of the mediocre ones.",/review/rw0371027/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2005,sharkey197,10," jaded seniors
","It's not easy to get seniors to do anything, even watch a movie and when you mention Jane Austen, they zone out. Yet each year when we do this film in class, about 80 percent end up loving it and that includes the guys. It's wonderful to watch them respond to the characters and get into a film that is so ""talky"" when they have been used to high action. To hear the girls call Willoughby a jerk and applaud Brandon at the end is great, but to listen to the boys comment on the behavior of the various characters is even better. How they respond to a society so filled with strict manners and codes of behavior also makes this film worthwhile and it generates much discussion about the importance of money in life; well, even Thompson in the commentary said the film is about money, who has it and who does not. I love showing this film to my students; after the groans when I start it on the first day, it's wonderful to hear their comments on day five when we finish. As one senior male said this year, ""I wouldn't have rented this or wanted to see it, but now that I have, I admit it was pretty good, so I'm glad you showed it."" This is why they are classics, kiddies.",/review/rw0371027/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2005,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," A true story of family, friends, sisterhood, heartbreak, and love
","I found ""Sense and Sensibilty"" to be one of the most charming movies I have seen since ""Finding Neverland"". It has a very warm feeling and is very welcoming. The story is absolutely beautiful. In the 1990's, all of Jane Austen's huge novels were made into movies and some even in television series. Most of them were very good, but Sense and Sensibility really stood out and was the best. Most thanks to Emma Thompson and her brilliant screenplay, which was also her first. Kudos to her, she seems like a fine and intelligent woman. I found out that this screenplay took her about 4 years to have the final draft done. She also couldn't translate some of the novel into the book so she took some of Austen's letters and put them into the movie.",/review/rw0371027/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2003,llltdesq,9," Excellent period piece, well adapted and with a witty script and fine performances.
","This is a remarkable film that does a very good job of depicting a rigid and quite hidebound society that often made India's caste system look reasonable and moderate by comparison.  One of the more enjoyable points for me was the fact that the ""sense and sensibility"" of the title had a most definite 19th Century feel and yet still remains very timeless and does not attempt to force Twentieth Century mores (probably by use of a crowbar) into a script where they do not belong.  Modern day viewpoints do not belong here.  If you want a modern day version, fine.  But it would be, at best, only a glancing and quite loose adaptation of the novel, so why do an adaptation at all, then?  Not all films have to reflect present day sensibilities.  This is a very human and compelling story with a fine cast and wonderfully witty script.  Look for a very dry and understated performance by Hugh Laurie as Mr. Palmer, the long-suffering husband of the daughter of Mrs. Jennings. Were I Mr. Palmer, I'd have long since invested in earplugs or opened a vein.  Very fine film and most highly recommended.",/review/rw0371027/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2000,pma97dr-2,10," Very good adaptation.
","This is one of the best of the recent Jane Austen films, from one of her weaker books. Emma Thompson has done a fine job of the script, not slavishly remaining faithful to the book but not abandoning it either.",/review/rw0371027/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2010,MyrPraune,," The best scene: Elinor's finding out that Edward is still single
","For all the rest that can be said about this beautiful film, there is one reason why I particularly love it: During the whole movie you see Emma Thompson portraying Elinor successfully as a young woman who deeply loves, but who chooses to conceal her own feelings so she will not bring reproach on herself or her loved ones, or even on less deserving people. Emma Thompson succeeds in conveying all of this in looks, small hesitations, subtle body language and never are we in disbelief. It all seems real and right, and you can truly believe that people never saw her feelings although at the same time you can see that they are real and very deep. I compare it for an example with Amanda Root's portrayal of Anne Elliott in Persuasion; I really had a hard time believing people did not see through her sad puppy eyes and sighs and nervous grabbing chairs and all these unsubtle ways she would play out Anne's inner torment. Anyway, to come back to Emma Thompson and Elinor, I know some people thought that her reaction at the end of the movie, when she finally learns that Edward is not married and that he wants to ask for her hand, is not really lady like and maybe even exaggerated. I could not agree less. This is the reaction of someone who has been loving and feeling and hurting for a long time, holding it in so she would hurt people around her the least possible; and on the moment of learning that finally, happiness is within her reach, that finally all this has not been for nothing, she just bursts out in uncontrollable crying and sobbing. I just could not hold my own tears when I saw the movie the first time, and believe me, I am not one to cry over sappy love stories usually. I just identified so much with her self-sacrifice of every moment for so long, which suddenly turned into too much happiness to hold inside. Wow! That, in and of itself, is one reason to see and cherish this version of Sense and Sensibility; and then there is so much more but I'll leave it at that!",/review/rw0371027/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2001,amadore80,10," A subtle masterpiece
","I saw this movie in a cinema back in 1996 and since that June I have seen it about a dozen times. It is true, that being an ardent lover of the so-called Romantic (as if the 13th century couldn't be Romantic or 17th, but these things are academic nonsense) period I can enjoy even minor pieces of period cinema, however this is most probably the best film set in the early 19th century. Although it centers on the relationship of the two sisters and their respective romantic relationships, it also seems to be a salute to the period itself in its precise description of the English country society. It is truthful to Jane Austen's novel, but Emma Thompson's script is fine in its own right, with many omissions and additions to the novel. The acting is superb, Kate Winslet as the typical Romantic dreamer (sensibility) is breathtaking (try not to be moved when her character wanders in the rain to see the house of her beloved and when she whispers half-deranged: 'Willoughby, Willoughby, Willoughby.') is perfect as is Emma Thompson as the rational but equally tormented older sister(sense). Greg Wise is perfect as the dashing semi-Byronic hero Willoughby and Allan Rickman as the mellow Brandon. To say nothing of the art direction, the music or the fantastic image composition. I would recommend everyone with some sort of emotional subtlety to see this film, for the story, the wit, the period and the imagery.",/review/rw0371027/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2019,Kirpianuscus,," lovely work
","I am not a fan of Jane Austen novels. And, after I wrote them and I saw adaptations of them, I am far to become one. But this version... . Obvious, it is different. In profound good sense. For the great performances. For the wise script. For a perfect director who knows the subtle art of storytelling. Short, a superb film. And the brilliant Emma Thompson working fine to her character and her story.",/review/rw0371027/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," Great book, beautiful film!
","I love Jane Austen, and I love period dramas. This film, while a little too long, was perfect for me. I loved it when I first saw it a year ago, and I still love it now. Sense and Sensibility is a great book by Miss Austen, and this film does the book justice, in my personal opinion. The film looks gorgeous, the camera-work, the locations and the costumes. The script sparkled with wit, subtlety, romance and heartache, especially when Marianne goes out into the rain and gets herself ill. The music is lovely also. The performances were exceptional. Period-film veteran Emma Thompson is lovely here as Elinor Dashwood, and Kate Winslet matches her perfectly in a beautifully-blended portrayal of the tragic Marianne. As for the men, they were very good too. Hugh Grant was exceedingly charming as the male lead, and I have read many reviews criticising Alan Rickman's acting.(not on IMDb though) He may have been older than Miss Austen intended, he was very good also as Colonel Brandon, but not as good as the other three. His style of acting is very suave and charismatic, like Sean Connery and George Sanders. If you've seen him in Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves you'll know what I mean. All in all, a lovely film, maybe not the best period drama, but has plenty of elements that makes it truly memorable. 9/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw0371027/?ref_=tt_urv

19 September 2020,Xstal,7," Folly & Fallibility...
","A totally engrossing story of the desperation of women to become subservient to men and take a master. Admittedly that was the expectation in those days, still is for far too many girls around the world but this kind of urgent determination to find a 'good' man to wait upon belongs in a museum along with some slave master statues. That aside, the acting, especially Emma Thompson is top notch, it's directed by a visionary and pioneer and it flows quite elegantly along with a poetic and humorous dialogue. Sadly, the only lessons to learn are those still being learnt some centuries later.",/review/rw0371027/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2021,gbill-74877,8," Quality film
","A wonderful enactment of Jane Austen's first novel from 1811, in which two sisters at the marrying age suffer from affairs of the heart. One has an inclination towards common sense and decorum (Emma Thompson), and the other, an emotional side, with great sensitivity to passion and romance (Kate Winslet). In addition to the heartbreak that comes from unrequited love and bad behavior from men, the film also makes clear the limited options women had in 19th century England, with paternalistic inheritance laws and limited employment options, something I liked about it.",/review/rw0371027/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am always interested in how a movie is received on both sides of the Atlantic.

10 January 2005,clarific,10," one word: wow.
","This is a truly great movie. It is one that I can watch over and over, yet can never seem to get enough of! Kate Winslet is gorgeous, Emma Thomson is inspiring, and Hugh Grant shines in this unforgettable film. I have always loved a good movie; one i can sink into and fall in love with the characters. I feel that Sense and Sensibility presents all these things to the audience. There is love, heartbreak, humour and great music. (my applause to Kate Winslet for her unforgettable versions of ""Weep You No More Sad Fountains"" and ""The Dream"" ...so beautiful.) If you have not seen this movie, please go RIGHT now to rent it...or even ADD it to your video library! I must say it is well worth it!

15 August 2022,kellielulu,10," Holds up
","As good as when it first came out . There is a mix of drama, wit, joy , despairing, loss and gain . Finding love and losing it only to find it elsewhere or regain it at the most unexpected moment. The actors are superb . Emma Thompson pulled double duty here acting and writing , winning her second Academy Award this time for her splendid best adapted screenplay of Jane Austen's story of class and manners. The cinematography is sublime. Ang Lee direction is masterful capturing the look and the feel of another era and superbly directing a large cast. The sets gives an authentic look to another time and place as do the costumes. There is simply no negative to be found in this classic film.",/review/rw0371027/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2006,Sherazade,10," Excellent and award worthy in every way!
","Before The tigers crouched and the dragons hid, before the boys of Brokeback mountain, there was Ang Lee's masterpiece Sense and Sensibility, which I'm sure he won several Oscars for. It is probably the best adaptation of Sense and Sensibility you will ever see, with stellar performances by Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson, all who give award worthy emotions throughout the film. This was the movie that brought Kate Winslet her first Oscar nomination (and 1st Bafta win) and Emma Thompson her first award for best adapted screen play. This film is perfect in every way I do not even see the need to discuss the script. The backdrop and costumes are magnificent, as are the dialogues, situations and general feel of the entire pace and plot. A must see for everyone and anyone with good taste for awesome cinema!",/review/rw0371027/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2018,classicsoncall,8," ""Love is not love, which alters when it alteration finds, or bends with the remover to remove.""
","I'm not big on period films but this one held my attention well enough. I've seen Emma Thompson recently in a couple of Kenneth Branagh's Shakespearean adaptations, and have come to appreciate her talent in a way I haven't noticed before. The actor I couldn't quite endear myself to in this story was Hugh Grant. He seemed to have such a wimpy demeanor that it turned me off to his character. Not his fault probably, because director Ang Lee is calling the shots. Lee continually surprises me with films so disparate in which he's the guiding hand. How do you figure ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""Hulk"" and ""Life of Pi"" were all directed by the same man who did the honors for this film? I'm at a loss to explain it.",/review/rw0371027/?ref_=tt_urv
