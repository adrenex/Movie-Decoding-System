","Sure it's formulaic, but they do it well with a wide range of distinct characters and along the way tackle some real issues. And here I am in 2021 rewatching it because it beats everything being made 15 years later.",/review/rw1674193/?ref_=tt_urv

","There are so many things that can be said about Jericho. It is fantasy drama based on U.S. foreign policy and corporate corruption in the government. It brilliantly brings atrocities committed by Blackwater in Iraq into the spotlight by bringing the issue home to the United States and showing ""ravenwood"" abusing U.S. citizens in the same way. Parallels and caricatures showing the actions of corrupt government, corporations, and individuals who have helped destroy United States Liberties and civil rights.",/review/rw1674193/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2019,xxxNomadicxxx,10," How and why?
","How can a show like this be canceled and show like the Crawling Dead survive. Especially after one full season. Great story line, could have went on for seasons. Season two was shortened and consolidated but still was great all to the episode before the last. Yes, this series had filler episodes, but they used it appropriately for character development and not to make it to mid-season/season finale. The threats were real, the fights were intense, and you felt the struggle. No pointless dialogue just to avoid getting ahead of a comic book because of lack of writing material. The villains were believable and didn't need a whole season to give them their story, or had to wait till the season opener, mid-season, or season finale to see them in action.",/review/rw1674193/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2021,ptoering-67846,10," This was canceled....
","You've seen a myriad of garbage tv shows parade across your screen, some with 5+ seasons of mediocrity. This is not that show. Every bit as engaging as it was 15+ years ago, it's really worth a watch. Is the production value up to snuff in 2021? No, but its still great writing, a great premise, and decent acting. If you like TWD but could lose the zombies, take a look.",/review/rw1674193/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2010,BlackTaterTotallyBlue,8," Small town, big bang.
","It's a great series that deserved more of a fighting chance. It's easy to understand the many ardent fans of the show, but hard to understand Jericho's failure to attract more viewers than it did. The show is engaging, to the point of being dangerously addicting and whatever it lacks (see below), that's more than made up for by a consistently inventive story expansion. The show moves seamlessly from the original premise of 'USA - post nuke' into much unexpected territory. There's some filler episodes, but barely a bum one. What hampers the series is that odd but inevitable 'dated' feeling that almost all network dramas fail to shake, even the minute they arrive on our screens. Dramas like this just can't live up to the HBO/AMC cannon because of the demands on them to, eg: appeal to a large audience and produce 22-ish episodes per series - it can be simply backbreaking. One can't help but imagine how much better this show could have been with a studio like HBO behind it. It certainly deserves more care, with which it might have not been cancelled. Nevertheless, the fact one can imagine Jericho's greater potential is a credit to the strength of both the inventive writing, the smart political commentary and the many well-drawn characters which shine through occasional soft-focus, feel-good, pre-watershed moments of schmaltz and sentimentality. Those moments are thankfully few, but there's enough to make you wish there were less. The cast are all very capable, particularly Skeet Ulrich, Lennie James and Gerald McRaney who lend the show its gravitas. Bring it back! 4/5",/review/rw1674193/?ref_=tt_urv

",I was disappointed in how this series didn't get off to the best start but it sure kept getting better. I loved how it explored the American core ideal of resilience and always coming back after any catastrophe.

I even got teary eyed a few times through the show. That is a rare thing for me. I usually never get teary eyed during a show or a movie. However, ""Jericho"" is a whole different kind of show.

27 September 2006,mfvaughn,10," Excellent Apocalytic Drama
","Having seen only two episodes, I am mildly surprised by the effectiveness of this well presented drama. A relationships-based drama, focused around the family of the Mayor (Gerald McRaney) of a small town, Jericho, thus far the acting and writing is top notch. Tense story lines have been the mark of Jericho thus far. Reminiscent of 24, Jericho is setting up well, and I look forward to the unwinding of the story of a few thousand people struggling to survive and overcome the aftermath of a multiple strike atomic holocaust coast to coast in America's metropolitan centers, leaving Jericho an island of life and hope. Of particular note is the acting of Allison Scott, the acting of Skeet Ulrich, and the understated but grounding performances of both McRaney and as his wife and the matriarch, the always fine Pamela Reed. It will be interesting to see if this strong start can be sustained, or if the storyline will wear thin. The executive production team is youthful but in combination has significant experience in film and in relationship-based TV that bodes well. In order for Jericho to survive, and it should, the tension needs to be maintained for the central family, for Jericho's attempts to survive, for the people of Jericho to maintain their humanity and their optimism, and for the outside world to impinge in a way that makes the struggle for the better parts of our human condition endure. Mighty big tasks, but my hope is that this intelligent, sensitive, and provocative program survives too.",/review/rw1674193/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is the best new show I've seen in a long time and the casting is brilliant skeet ulrich would not of been my first choice for the role of Jake but the more I watch the more Skeet grows into the role and not to mention anything that could spoil the series but I cannot believe how well the idea/premise behind the show fits with modern day living the who was it how did it happen is intriguing but not only that you have to keep trying to guess who are the good guys who are the bad you'll never see a better piece of t.v with such intrigues as this one I would definitely recommend to people whom like anything lost fans for the intrigue, sci fir fans because of the plot (e.g roswell, buffy, etc), those fans of law and order or csi because of the mystery in the story, and finally those whom like the teary eyed melodramas because of the human angle.",/review/rw1674193/?ref_=tt_urv

","Just finished watching Jericho on Netflix (all 29 episodes over two days). Others have written about the show's premise and storyline, so I won't repeat those here. As for my take on the show: First I have to say, anyone claiming that the acting is poor either stopped watching after a couple episodes or watched a different show entirely. Rarely have I seen such moving performances on television or anywhere else. I found myself relating to almost all the characters, and their hardships were believable and realistic. If anything, the acting was TOO moving; my wife and I were both teared up a few times, and given that several of the main characters die and there is no shortage of sad moments.",/review/rw1674193/?ref_=tt_urv

",I've watched this one from start to finish several times and it never gets old. The plot and character development are top notch. The characters are what really hook you. The cast really sell their characters. The way they interact makes you feel like they really did all live together in a small Kansas town. The plot is intriguing. Its a great look into a believable set of circumstances with a cast of characters you really root for. It should have been continued for longer than the 1.3 seasons it was given.,/review/rw1674193/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2006,cuffdaddy,10," Awesome Show
","This has got to be by far the best series on TV. The mixture of mystery/drama/science fiction is excellent as well as the characters. It reminds me of William Johnston's book series ""The Ashes"" with the doomsday theme. Skeet Ulrich's character is suspenseful because no one knows where he's been or what he's done for the last 5 years, yet he's able to save a little girl on the bus and then kill one of the convicts his first day back! The way they ended the second show with the former policeman putting red pins on cities that were nuked and not showing where he put all the pins leaves you in suspense! Keep up the great job and don't cancel this show!!!!",/review/rw1674193/?ref_=tt_urv

10 May 2009,Chris Knipp,9," What's going on?
","The 29-eppisode ""Jericho"" is an excellent, almost great American TV series. How smart its creators are shows in how skillfully it juggles its huge body of topics, plot-lines, and characters--critics never quite come to terms with it all. ""Jericho's"" ardent fans have provided extensive blogs and keys to the segments, more briefly summarized in a Wikipedia episodes list. Supporters go a little overboard in their devotion, reading details like tealeaves or entrails, but their loyalty shows how involving and rich this series is.",/review/rw1674193/?ref_=tt_urv

30 June 2013,Sanpaco13,9," The worst of times bring out the best in people
","I really enjoyed this show. It seems like the writers really did a good job of researching what it would be like if the US got hit with nuclear bombs and society broke down. I love the drama that comes out of the situation but I also love the fact that, unlike most shows, the good guys always come out ahead in this movie. Every other show there's some bad guy that gets away with everything and that never gets caught or whatever, but in this show, there is a pretty solid line between the good guys and the bad guys and most of the ""situations"" are resolved relatively quickly instead of drawing them out for an entire season. For example, in the first couple of episodes with the escape prisoners... I just knew that this was gonna be a thing now in the first season. They'd be out constantly trying to find the prisoners and the prisoners were gonna keep the girl captive for a long time and every scene was gonna be her trying to escape and getting caught again, etc for like 15 episodes until she finally gets rescued. But nope. Jake shows up and shoots them in the face and the story ends there. Thank you so much for killing an uninteresting plot before it got annoying.",/review/rw1674193/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2006,thekaj,5," Meh, I just don't know
","The premise is certainly interesting enough. A small town seemingly cut off from the rest of the world as civilization itself might have gone up with a mushroom cloud. It's a story that has been effectively told in the book Alas Babylon and the miniseries The Day After. Those are big footsteps to follow in, and I'm not too sure this show can do it.",/review/rw1674193/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2007,endymionng,7," interesting but way to soapy
","So we are done with the first season of this interesting premise combining the classic movie ""The Day After"" with the equally strong British post-catastrophe show from the seventies called ""Survivors"". The British show had a virus kill of 99% of the British population, so the rebuilding and maintaining of society and civilization is the same as here. However this US show is so far spending way to much time in close-ups of soapy sub-plots that belongs on daytime television instead being the though gritty tale it could be. I don't mind the big baddie lurking far away as a potential threat, but the story ought to focus on the rebuilding of society if it is going tell a meaningful tale. As with the ""Invasion"" show from 2005 nothing much happens at all between the pilot and episode 12 at which point it has almost painted itself into a corner... We will see what (if anything) happens to save the show. Points for pretty decent acting (although they killed the best one in the final - that was nuts...), potential and some of the subplots, but thats it - more than seven is nuts...",/review/rw1674193/?ref_=tt_urv
