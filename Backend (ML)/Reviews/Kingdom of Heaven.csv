2 March 2007,TheMovieMark,6," Everything is indeed hotter down South
","I'll be honest with you; this is not the type of movie that I'm usually drawn to. All you have to do is watch the trailer and read the plot summary to figure out where you stand. But just to continue this honest streak, I have to admit that Jackson and Ricci are so good in their roles, that they were able to pull me into the story and keep a grip on my interest.",/review/rw2028992/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2007,sundevil27,9," Craig Brewer convinces us that he is for real and Samuel L. makes sweet music
","Just saw this fantastic film at the Sundance premier and cannot sing its praises enough. Last time I saw Craig Brewer he was singing Ike and Tina to the audience and turning Sundance upside down with his breakout film Hustle and Flow. This time around he fulfills on his big Sundance payday with another unique vision thats going to get everyone talking about Samuel L Jackson, and if you thought Christina Ricci was just that girl in the Addams Family movies then think again. Ricci plays Rae a complete mess of a women who without her beloved Ronnie, played by the getting better all the time Justin Timberlake, has an uncontrollable need for all things sexual. When Ronnie leaves for the a tour with the Army, Rae's demons send her tumbling down a bumpy road that leaves her used and abused left for dead on the side of the road. Along comes old blues-man Lazarus played by the great Samuel L Jackon, Lazarus himself has a few demons lurking around in his head as well, notably his ex-wife who done wrong by him. Lazarus gets to think about this young women and after some soul searching he takes it upon himself to cure her evil ways with some love, some lessons and a 40 lb. chain. I don't want to reveal too much so I'll just say there's some dark moments, some very funny moments and whole lot of great acting. This movie isn't by any means Hustle & Flow 2, however Craig Brewer does tie the two films together with his hope for redemption and change for the better for even the most unlikely of people. Audiences will find a movie worth watching here and worth thinking about well after it ends.",/review/rw2028992/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2007,jaredmobarak,9," This little light of mineÂ…Black Snake Moan
","Craig Brewer is now officially a writer/director for whom I will see any film by, no matter how bad it may look. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites from that year, with its emotionally charged storyline and realistic, fallible characters. I wasn't quite sure what I would end up thinking after seeing this sophomore effort. The cast seemed great, the trailer used music effectively, however, it seemed like there was a good chance it would cross into absurdity, and fast. Fortunately, Black Snake Moan hits all its marks dead-on. The acting is astonishing, the writing superb, and the editing style, as well as juxtaposed music, riveting the whole way. Brewer seems to be a master at getting his characters to have the right mix of both compassion and malice as they set forward on their paths toward redemption.",/review/rw2028992/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2007,danceNchrist,9," surprising movie with a good message
","Working at a movie theater as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch basically every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan' I laughed and thought, ""Great. Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie"". But of course, I wanted to see it for the laugh factor. Many people have judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and on the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. Personally I loved every second of this movie. It tells the story of an older man and young woman who are both going through rough times and are able to reach out to one another. The story is truly touching and sends out a great message about life and how we live. Of course, I do not recommend it for young audiences due to some graphic material, but if you are looking for a great story and genuine acting from Sam Jackson, Christina Ricci and,yes, even Justin Timberlake, I encourage you to see 'Black Snake Moan'.",/review/rw2028992/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2007,u2nspenserfan,7," The heart of the delta blues
","I watched this movie at the first showing available in my area, and it was quite clear that most people didn't get the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thoroughly human story about some very imperfect people in a backwoods southern town, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what the ""Black Snake Moan"" is by the time you leave the theater, you didn't get it. And no.. it's not just a song. Christina Ricci does a great job and is thoroughly convincing in her role, as is Samuel L Jackson. I think this is his best performance since his role in Pulp Fiction, and probably his best including that because of the range of his character in BSM. The rest of the cast is solid, with a few shining performances here and there, particularly John Cothran Jr as Reverend R. L.. I'm a very selective movie watcher, and this film honestly rates among my favorites because of its candid look at race, sex, religion and neurosis in a rural southern town, along with its cinematic genius, in my opinion.",/review/rw2028992/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you've been looking for a film where a out of control nympho gets chained to a radiator by an extremely religious southern man then look no further than Paramount Vantage's latest release 'Black Snake Moan'. Not exactly looking for what I just described you say? Well then, you best get ya wits 'bout yaself and mosey on down to your local theater and still see it as Samuel L.

11 February 2007,rgparise-1,8," An excellent movie with disastrous marketing
","We just saw this film previewed before release at the Norfolk (VA) Film Forum, and there was general agreement on two matters: There were excellent performances in a first rate drama by the two leads and by others: and secondly, the marketing for this movie will only bring disaster. We saw a lurid poster with chains and suggestive commentary implying some sort of wacko sexual relationship between Samuel Jackson and Cristina Ricci, whereas the movie has some real depth and some thoughtful ideas. What's sad is that people looking for near porn will be drawn in to see the film and will be disappointed because it will be too ""heavy"" for them, while the people who would really enjoy it wouldn't be caught dead walking into the theater showing it. Too bad. A good film wasted.",/review/rw2028992/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2007,Fedaykin_Sadako,10," Great film!
","I knew as soon as I saw the first trailer for Black Snake Moan that I would have to see it. I was not disappointed in the slightest in the film, which was written and directed by Hustle and Flow's creator Craig Brewer. It tells the story of a broken blues man and the nymphomaniac he aims to cure not just for her sake, but also his own...yet it's so much more than that. It's complex and rich and it manages to steep you in a gritty, sticky, sultry blue Memphis without making you feel like you need a bath afterward.",/review/rw2028992/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2016,ironhorse_iv,7," Black Snake Moan is off the chain, great.
","The title of this film, ""Black Snake Moan"" refers to a really old song by country blues musician, Blind Lemmon Jefferson in which, the singer talks about his sexual addiction and his moans for love, once more. Full of explicit sexual nuances, Jefferson's song full of unconventional melodic style and utilization of double entendres, was able to fly pass the radar of censorship, back in the 1920s. As much, I like how Jefferson was able to pioneer this style of music. I have to say, actor, Samuel Jackson sings the song, so much better than Blind Lemmon Jefferson, ever did. Jackson was really able to update the song to fit with this new generation with his electric guitar playing, deep shouting gravitas voice, and depth of his character's backstory. It was very moving part of the film. Honestly, most of this movie is very compelling with its controversial subjects that include but are not limited to rape, sexual addiction, parental abuse, anxiety disorders, and religious outlooks. Without spoiling this polarizing film, too much, I have to say, I kinda like the story of the grumpy hermit/ former Blues singer, Lazarus Redd (Samuel L. Jackson) trying to rebuild his life after a nasty divorce, while also, trying hard to cure, a known nymphomaniac, Rae Doole (Christina Ricci) from her faults. It made for a very well-told story. I love all the metaphors and symbolism that this film has to offer, too. A good example of one is the chain that Rae wears around her waist, during most of the film and the type of shirt, she is wearing. If you don't realize it, already Rae represented the South, and its struggles, after the American Civil War. Not only, does her chain, represented the heavy weight of learning to live, with the mistakes and haunts of the past, but her chained up character is also stand-in, for the continuous, ignored issue of modern day slavery. After all, the region, is known for being a strong bible belt, but it also been known to keep that belt unbuckled when it comes to the dangers of having too lust, over the sense of love. The high reports of human trafficking, sexual abuse, and sex slaves is signed of that. Although, the chain can represented, something bad and naughty, it also can somewhat represented the unity that the South has, with its supply chain, when it comes to addressing the issue, in hand. There is no bigger metaphor of that, than the radiator in which Lazarus chain up Rae. It represented, the ever changing social climate of the South, as conflicts can indeed heat up, or cool down. No matter, how far, you run away from your issues. You will always been weighted down, by what society, thinks and wants from you. It's only, when you able to address the past, and learn to live with yourself, in a moral life, is when the removal of the chain, can be seem, as a meaningful step toward a better future. Another thing, I like about this film is that Lazarus, isn't a mysterious 'magical black negro' type character with no backstory, nor does Rae represented the 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' that is there to save his soul. In many ways, both characters are well-defined, with each, having their own issues to deal with, on their own, with or without the help from the other. Nobody is depended on the other, at all. Like Lazarus's namesake, it's about the redemption and resurrection of two, clearly mess up people. However, people might not see that, through the film's poster and exploitation marketing. The way, they market, this movie makes it, seem like a more like a porno than a character study film. It really does overblows the potential fetish fuel of the film, at the expense of everything else. It's not the best. Don't get me wrong, Christina Ricci is one, attractive woman, but her character wasn't made, just for nudity and fan service. She really, put some work, in showing how ugly and unhealthy, Rae can really be. She really does look pale and pasty. Even Samuel L. Jackson, ugly himself up, by letting his hair grow out, not dying or shaving, to show, how wash-up, his character has become. Both actors, really made their character, their own. I also have to give, mad props to both, the supporting actors in this film. Justin Timberlake as Rae's boyfriend, Ronnie was great. He really was, able to show his character emotional crutch, with the way, his body language moves. He really did seem like he suffers from extreme social anxiety. It really shows Hollywood, that the then-newly made solo singer can indeed, acted. Another person that need some praise is Michael Raymond-James as Ronnie's friend, Gill Morton. He was able to show both, his loving cares and hateful lust for Rae, making his performance, a very sympathetically real-life person. Even thought, he tries to make advances on Rae, which is a no-no, in my picture; I still can understand, what stress, he had to deal with when dealing with mess up people who supposed to be your friends. Overall: While, still many viewers will undoubtedly be offended by director Craig Brewer's representation of a still-segregated, racist South; I have to say, I love how the film acknowledges the importance of sex, while also highlighting the danger of having sex irresponsibly, all without being too heavy-handed and preachy. I also cherish the film, for its use of 'Delta Blues' type music and how well-shot, it was. In the end, this clever morality tale about two unlikely characters is a must-watch. I do recommended. It's pleasantly amazing.",/review/rw2028992/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2007,bluzalley,9," Moan hits Home ..
","Just got back from seeing Black Snake Moan. I had spent time reading reviews ... most seemed to focus on the obvious ... ""skinny white girl chained to a black man's radiator"" ... I hate when ""critics"" miss the point of a film. Now I suppose it helps that I live in Memphis ... and have lived in Mississippi a couple of times too. It may also help that I am the former Director of the Delta Blues Museum in Clarksdale ... but I get this movie. Brewer's simple ""redemption tale"" is easy to follow and could have had various themes to tell the story ... but I believe it is highly effect as a ""blues"". It would be my hope that people don't read all the hype ... and/or various reviews ... and miss a really good movie. Get past the various things like skinny girls in white panties ... get past Justin Timberlake, accept his character Ronnis (which he plays very well) ... get past ""Snakes on a Plane"" and see how mercuricul Samuel L. Jackson is ... as he has transformed himself into a very believable Mid-South blues man. If you know little about Mid-South culture a lot of what goes on may strike some as cartoonish ... but accept the fact that Craig Brewer KNOWS how to paint the canvas and let the actors tell the story and you will enjoy this film. Not one to tell endings ... so go see this movie ... and yes I will agree with one thing the critics got right ... the music is wonderful!",/review/rw2028992/?ref_=tt_urv

Walking in I was expecting something controversial, provocative, unnecessarily overdone, etc.. But the film is much more than that. It's a story of two people helping each other.

","If ever a potential movie must've sounded like it wouldn't work based on reading the script on paper, it would be this one. Here we have what seemingly looks like a lurid and seedy soft-porn s&m flick, complete with the huge in-theatre poster, depicting a near-naked Christina Ricci chained to none other than Mr. Bad Ass MF himself, Samuel Jackson. But let me tell you, if ever a film springs to life on celluloid major big time with soulful power to spare, it's Craig Brewer's redemptive follow-up to Hustle & Flow, Black Snake Moan.",/review/rw2028992/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2007,Woodyanders,8," Samuel Jackson and Christina Ricci are both outstanding in this strong and poignant tale of sin and redemption
","Reclusive and angry former blues singer turned farmer Lazarus (superbly played by the always excellent Samuel L. Jackson) is in a hurting way after his wife Rose leaves him after twelve years of unhappy marriage. Brassy and tormented trampy white trash nymphomaniac Rae (a remarkably raw and startling performance by Christina Ricci) sure ain't feeling too good, either. Lazrus finds Rae's battered body on the side of the road. After nursing her back to health, Lazarus chains Rae to his radiator in order to help the troubled lass overcome her demons. Writer/director Craig Brewer uses the potentially lurid and tasteless premise to spin a surprisingly potent and poignant tale of sin, redemption and the intrinsic fallibility of human nature. Rae and Lazarus are two lost and broken souls who help each other heal and become whole again. Jackson and Ricci are terrific in the leads, with equally strong support from Justin Timberlake as Rae's loyal, long-suffering boyfriend Ronnie, S. Epatha Merkerson as Lazarus' helpful lady friend Angela, John Cothran Jr. as the compassionate Reverend R.L., and onetime 70's child actress Kim Richards as Rae's bitter estranged mother Sandy. The vividly brooding and flavorsome Southern Gothic atmosphere, Amy Vincent's polished cinematography, Scott Bomar's moody score and the first-rate soulful blues soundtrack are all likewise on the money as well. As an added treat, Jackson growls out a few fantastic get-down gritty blues numbers and Ricci even sings a touchingly sweet rendition of the gospel tune ""This Little Light of Mine."" Offbeat, inspired and original, ""Black Snake Moan"" overall qualifies as an extremely moving, compelling and provocative winner.",/review/rw2028992/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2007,zetes,7," Christina Ricci needs a burger
","Any movie where Samuel L. Jackson chains up a scantily clad Christina Ricci to his radiator to cure her of her nymphomania has to be at least worth seeing. What I didn't expect is that it would turn into a respectable drama by the end. And that's wherein the disappointment lies. It is a good movie. Christina Ricci and Sam Jackson are both excellent, the story is well written and it's different from anything else I can remember, even if it does end up endorsing the boring old status quo. The film could have been a lot more memorable if it had just stayed sleazy throughout. Still, it has its moments. The first sequence where Ricci discovers the chain around her belly is gold. You have to love Sam Jackson's titular song. And the sequence where Ricci writhes sweatily to another Jackson-belted blues number is hot as hell. Certainly worth seeing, but wait for rental.",/review/rw2028992/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2012,Leofwine_draca,6," Tamer than you'd think
","For a film about a young, sexually voracious white woman who's chained to a radiator by a God-fearing older black man, BLACK SNAKE MOAN is surprisingly non-exploitational. Instead, it's an intriguing enough character piece, juxtaposing two entirely different protagonists and exploring their relationship when they're forced together by circumstance.",/review/rw2028992/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2007,Quinoa1984,8," a pure Blues movie, if not a great one, with Jackson in one of his coolest performances
","I didn't quite get what I expected from Black Snake Moan, but by the end I didn't mind too much either. I went into it thinking I was going to get a real low-down, Southern-Fried exploitation flick where race relations get turned around in a small town and the ""wickedness"" that Sam Jackson's blues-man character is trying to rid of Christina Ricci's wily nymph would sort of parallel that. In short, pure, unadulterated outrageousness of the Sam Fuller White Dog variety. It goes without saying that the central 'gimmick' (and it is nearing a gimmick I think) of the chain around Ricci- and particularly one moment where Lazarus (Jackson) is letting out Rae (Ricci) for a walk like a dog around the his field he farms- is meant to be outrageous, as are the moments when Lazarus's young assistant farmer-boy walks in on the itching-for-sex Rae and gets jumped by him for 'it'. But really, the intelligence of Brewer's script and how he handles the characters is that we get to see these people not just as simple caricatures but as real people, with histories, and it actually becomes a story of redemption, for both Lazarus and Rae as well as Rae's anxiety driven dishonorably discharged army man Ronnie played by Justin Timberlake. These characters do have the blues, and their own personal discoveries are put against this gritty, small-town Southern setting.",/review/rw2028992/?ref_=tt_urv

","A fantastic elevation of his southern-fried cinema form, Craig Brewer proves that there's a lot more to the durty south then rappers and pimps with his exciting and unique third feature Black Snake Moan. Replacing the crunked- up template that helped garner Hustle & Flow all of it's gritty praise, Brewer shifts the focus to a way older musical tradition in the South, the Blues. Proving the opposite of a one-trick-pony, this noticeable young writer and director weaves a potent spell of sleaze, laughter, terror, and redemption around Samuel L.

After a party, Rae is taken home by a friend who ends up beating her half to death and throws her on the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home. Lazarus gives medical care to Rae, and believes that he can also save her from herself. Rae is like a dog in heat so Lazarus puts a 40 pound chain around her and his radiator to keep her from going out looking for men.

","This movie had a notion to be something gritty and provocative, but with all its dirty talk and soft-core sex, ends up being some kind of white-trash fairy tale where the fairy godmother is a black semi-legendary bluesman who's having his own crisis of faith. If you don't automatically flash to Robert Johnson down at the crossroads, there are some clips of Son House talking about the real meaning of the blues. Stereotypes abound in ""Black Snake Moan"" which isn't a bad thing when you're trying to create an allegory for race relations down in the delta and how much nobler rural southern blacks are than their ignorant immoral white counterparts. Having grown up (white) in the south in the 50s and 60s, I know there's quite a bit of truth in that.",/review/rw2028992/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2007,EUyeshima,3," Absurd, Southern-Fried Melodrama Never Transcends Its Audacious Premise
","It would be too easy to dismiss this strangely unsatisfying 2007 film entirely because I can't tell whether director/writer Craig Brewer (Hustle & Flow) is trying to satirize the Southern Gothic sensibilities of a Tennessee Williams potboiler or replicate the excesses of an early 1970's blaxploitation movie. Either way, he cannot seem to pull off his audacious premise which involves a cuckolded blues guitarist appropriately named Lazarus who enchains a nymphomaniac to his radiator. If the film was played out as over-the-top as the premise, then it might have had a fighting chance, but as it stands, Brewer is too ensconced in his chicken-fried fable to mine the potential black comedy in this hilariously preposterous exercise.",/review/rw2028992/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2009,Chrysanthepop,," Heal Thy Snake
","'Black Snake Moan' was certainly different from what I had expected. The poster/DVD cover give a different impression and so does the trailer. However, it turns out to be a different kind of movie and a pleasant surprise. It tells the moving tale of a bluesman/farmer and a young nymphomaniac. Brewer's writing is solid as he laces humour into a film that is otherwise brutal and graphic. The dialogues are funny and the characters are well written. Christina Ricci is fabulous. Rae's anguish is well depicted and she does draw sympathy from the viewer as she is very convincing as a victim of sexual abuse. Samuel Jackson is stupendous as Rae's potential saviour. Both characters are trying to battle with pain. Though Laz's method is less self-destructive, he sees an opportunity in Rae and that's where the story starts. Here too Jackson plays the angry man but, thankfully, with a gentler, more compassionate touch. Justine Timberfake's bad acting almost sticks out like a soar thumb but thankfully the two leads are strong enough to overtake that. Brewer's film is a touching tale about second chances and how compassion and kindness can heal a lot. As a last addition, I would say that the soundtrack is a must have for blues fan.",/review/rw2028992/?ref_=tt_urv
