6 April 2015,s3276169,10," Reinvents the ""golden age"" of UK TV
","The original Poldark was from what I would describe as the ""golden age"" of UK television. Poldark sat happily alongside wonderful series like Upstairs and Downstairs, The Onedin Line, The Duchess of Duke St and War and Peace. ",/review/rw5778207/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2015,tinyfeet69,9," Love It! Love It! Love It!
","I too am a huge fan of the Winston Graham novels and especially the original Poldark series that I watched as a young girl. I was a bit skeptical that they could remake such a classic but I am pleasantly surprised and how much I am loving this show so far. Aidan portrays Ross Poldark so well and is hot hot hot to say the least. The girl who plays Demelza (sorry her name escapes me at present) is great. I remember her from The White Queen mini-series and was impressed with her then. I was totally enthralled from beginning to end. The chemistry between Ross & Demelza is amazing, just how it should be. This series is well casted and well written. I am hooked! Hope it is around for a long long time. I am definitely a fan.",/review/rw5778207/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2019,childgaia7,," Season 5, very disappointing.
",Loved the show and was eagerly awaiting for Season 5. Totally disappointed. Perhaps should of finished with Season 4 cause it just ran right off the rails.,/review/rw5778207/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2015,mgumsley,8," sumptuous series!
","Poldark is a most promising series with a lively young cast and strong storyline - who can resist an eternal triangle = against the dramatic backdrop of the Cornish coast, and Aidan Turner is a likable hero whose rugged looks create a hit with the local ladies.",/review/rw5778207/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2015,ianlouisiana,9," Whole lot of smoulderin' going on.....
","Starting off smouldering as a redcoat in the American War of Independence where he ""volunteered"" to avoid being hanged back home in Cornwall,Ross Poldark (Mr A.Turner) continues much in the same vein on his return to find his inheritance gone and his fiancée appropriated by his rather wet cousin. He is man apart from his Cornish pals due to him having gone to a posh school and everything and feels like a square peg in a round hole living in a run - down bothy with two recalcitrant servants. On a visit to town to sell his watch he saves a young girl from a beating and takes her to a tavern where she exhibits shockingly bad manners;despite this he offers her a place at his pigsty,where,in short order she turns out to be a damned attractive young lady. She is called Demelza and is played with relish by Miss E.Tomlinson. Her Pa and her brothers come to take her back but are beaten off by Ross and his homies,this gives Mr Turner further opportunities to smoulder with a bloody nose to boot. His former fiancée realises she has made a terrible mistake,but she's obviously mistaken him for someone who gives a toss and he rides off with Demelza into episode two. I really enjoyed this new ""Poldark"" because it does post - modern irony which of course hadn't been invented forty years ago when it had it's first incarnation. It is a deliberate exercise in myth - building with Poldark himself set to be the next Mr Darcy. There are dog - fights,cock - fights and bloke - fights enough for anybody and Mr Turner cuts a suitable dash to ensure the next few Sunday nights will be accompanied by a couple of cans of lager and some Pringles. So it's off the blocks and running,then,for the Beeb's next Big One. Forget the politically - motivated ""Banished"" and watch this for the sheer fun of it.",/review/rw5778207/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2015,ohlabtechguy,10," Quite enjoyable
","Have watched the first 3 episodes. Great scenery, cinematography, acting and costumes. I love the setting in late 1700s/early 1800s England. But the best part is that the central character is thoroughly likable, even if not thoroughly plausible. Oh....and yes, he is handsome and does have an awesome, cut torso, which is besides the point. What attracts me more and more to a series is whether or not there are likable characters portrayed by great actors conveying realistic dialogue. I much prefer to watch someone likable than to watch someone unlikeable. No...I do NOT love to hate a villainous character. I would love to love a virtuous character. I am at an age, 55, where focusing on the positive in life is so much more important than focusing on the negative. I just wish Hollywood and the movie industry would catch up with me.",/review/rw5778207/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2020,Primerfan,8," 10 stars for each of Seasons 1-4, 0 stars for Season 5
","My spouse and I have long been fans of the Poldark novels by Winston Graham, and of the 1970's TV series. We absolutely loved seasons 1-4 of this new adaptation. The scripts were faithful (in most particulars) to the books, and everything about the production was excellent: casting, directing, acting, music, locations, sets, costumes...everything! After a season or two, we had high hopes that this series would continue through adaptations of all 12 novels, the last 4 of which have never been filmed. After Season 4...well, we could not have been more disappointed with Season 5. I don't see how this season's opening title sequence can still carry the subheading ""based on the novels by Winston Graham."" The story line is completely off the books and off the rails. Characters act in ways that Winston Graham's creations would never have behaved. Much of the plot is implausible. There are far too many villains: a huge percentage of the screen time is spent with despicable people plotting and carrying out nefarious deeds; this quickly loses entertainment value and becomes tiresome. The last few minutes of the last episode are spent in a mad scramble to turn everything around and catch everything up to a point from which the rest of the novels could actually have proceeded. This whole season is completely ludicrous and unenjoyable to watch. If those responsible for this series weren't going to continue adapting the novels, they should have stopped at the end of Season 4.",/review/rw5778207/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2019,trash-41084,3," Season 5 is dreadful
","The scripting is really bad. It's fine to make up your own story to some extent -- but the injection of politically correct claptrap that sticks out like a sore thumb spoils the whole thing. This is semi-historical drama, and story-lines that come from a different planet and would never have taken place do not sit well.",/review/rw5778207/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2018,carriescoffee,10," Best series ever
","I use IMDB all the time to look at reviews but I never leave them. I signed up for an account just so I could rate this series BECAUSE IT IS THAT AWESOME. The only thing that I wish was different is that there were more episodes in a season. Ross Poldark is one of my favorite characters of all time. I can't say enough about how good this show is and everyone involved deserves accolades from the actors to the producers and writers and costume and set designers. The filmography is spectacular. I hope there are many more seasons to come (preferably with more episodes in each season). I also would love to see more television like this. I love historical fiction but a lot of television includes way too much violence, rape, and heroes with extremely confusing and questionable ethics. I like how the characters are flawed and realistic, but still recognizably noble and heroic. There are underlying messages about humanity's flaws and how we do suffer the consequences of our actions but also the value of love, forgiveness, and compassion is emphasized.",/review/rw5778207/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2015,portobellolinda,10," The best television adaptation by far...
","I watched a little of the adaptation made in the 1970's but found the lead actor rather lame, though Anghared Rees was splendid. This time, its simply superb. Well cast and directed, with sumptuous Cornish scenery, the first episode introduces the main characters with a great deal of skill. We are not shown everything and not all is obvious, so there is an element of guesswork for the viewer, which always adds to the enjoyment. I can't wait for episode 2 and the others. Its fabulous, and shows how very skillful the team who put this together are. The narrative has strong sub texts which add richness to the feel of this and the acting is very fine. The whole experience was rich, costume and storyline, suspense and symbolism of the man who will not take hand-outs but instead, chooses to make his own way despite the fists of fortune punching his nose...",/review/rw5778207/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2016,TheLittleSongbird,9," Great, often magnificent, series- one of the highlights of 2015 television
","Admittedly, not everything on television interests me. Love the detective and period drama shows, and still get much enjoyment from animation and some cookery shows, but daytime television is often littered with talk shows and evening stuff often variable soap-operas and incredibly trashy reality shows with only two exceptions.",/review/rw5778207/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2020,jckercher,3," I have lost touch with the show
","The first couple of seasons were great. Season 4 was ok. Season 5 is lacking. I am not sure where the story is going. I have stopped watching after struggling through episode 5. Is it about slavery and racism? So much deceit and secrets and people too stupid to see the issues. Poldark himself is the cause of most issues. Risking everything without a thought for his family. Egad, i cannot watch anymore.",/review/rw5778207/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2019,ikanboy,7," Last season went off the rails.
","It's certainly not an edgy series and the Cornish characters seem (ARH,ARH,ARH) writ for TV, but it's quite entertaining. Being old I preferred the older series, and perhaps due to my age this one seemed less sophisticated. The last season was quite a let down. What with Warleggan's bouts of lunacy, Ned's bouts of senselessness, and Ross's bouts of concreteness, it became obvious that the writers decided to go for high ( on cocaine) drama instead of a reasonable tying up of loose ends.",/review/rw5778207/?ref_=tt_urv

","Rarely do I find a tale that so draws me in and that is because the story is elegant and gritty, actors outstanding, and scenery simply stunning! The word, ""noble"" means something and not all noblemen demonstrate it. The relationships are not predictable, nor the storyline which shows the desperation of those who scrape by--mostly with honor--and some not troubled by honor but wealth. From our first introduction to Ross, he shows his character and it is impossible not to care about him the way he cares about those in his life. I rate it higher than even Downton Abbey, which I have followed with dedication, as I will with Poldark. I hope it is around for a decade at least!",/review/rw5778207/?ref_=tt_urv

","I really enjoyed watching seasons 1-4. I'm one of those people that will see a series through to the end, good or bad, once I've committed to watching it. I tried to stick with it, but season 5 is so bad I had to cut it loose.",/review/rw5778207/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2019,braquecubism,8," if you like period pieces, for sure, watch this
","I think the characters and the plot are true to the times, from what I know. Poldark, is overall, a generous man who cares for the people on the land, struggling. Interesting, well acted. The costumes, the set, the direction. The panoramic views of the Country. Often his actions, especially toward woman are very much of the times. No feminism here. Intrigue, villainy, cowardice and courage, honor, among the characters.",/review/rw5778207/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2019,rick-413-797364,7," Skip the fifth season!
","The first four seasons are entertaining, well-acted, and faithful to the Winston Graham novels (even though the earlier Poldark series is better). However, the fifth and final season inexplicably strays from the books. It's a disaster and sadly leaves a bad taste.",/review/rw5778207/?ref_=tt_urv

23 July 2018,KathleenK22,6," This series has devolved into a soapie
","What a shame! This was such a good series to begin with and one that many people looked forward to watching. It is now a soapie!
The acting is not in question but rather the writing!
It needs to be rescued before it deteriorates further.
We need some well written scripts that return the series to its former glory wherein action and suspense were built into the storytelling.
Get away from the melodrama and wishy washy story telling that is no more than who has been with whom and who had whose child and who lost their love to whom and who is seducing who, etc.
You can do better than this! The scenery/setting is beautiful. The characters are clearly drawn and portrayed. Now give them something to work with. 
Hoping for some improved scripts for the actors to work with and needs to happen soon!",/review/rw5778207/?ref_=tt_urv

","What can one say about Debbie Horsfield's rendering of Winston Graham's evergreen series of classics that has not been said before? Being old enough to remember the 1975 version when Robin Ellis strode through the West Country with his scanty undershirt revealing a hairy chest and equally distinguished sideburns, I was impressed with Aidan Turner's recreation of the same role. Turner has a wonderful gift for smoldering; his features do not change much, but his eyes flash and his lips purse in a way that brooks no resistance from anyone. George Warleggan (Jack Farthing) is an eminently hissable villain, his pasty face and arrogant mien contrasting with Robin Poldark's humanity. The facial and bodily contrasts between the two resembles that of any great melodrama. We know George will get his comeuppance in the end, but we marvel at the extent to which he is prepared to manipulate others in order to achieve his aims.",/review/rw5778207/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2015,wendycscott9,10," Ross Poldark is alive!
","You don't have to find some mysterious stones to touch to go back in time to the 18th century. Just experience Poldark on a hi-def TV with a good sound system, and you'll BE there. From the stunning Cornwall scenery, to the careful attention to detail in the interior sets and locations, to costumes that range from the ragged to the rich, to the glorious music, and their wonderful choices for casting, especially the brilliant and charismatic Aidan Turner as Ross Poldark, this production has proved to be satisfying for people who have never seen the 70s version or read the novels it is based on, as well as those who have done either or both.

","The only intelligent characters are the antagonists and one young rich girl, all the protagonists are dumb as bricks and behave in stupid ways for plot convenience.
