24 August 2021,Chriss-Enefrega,3," Meh...
","This reality show has very little ""real"". Everything looks planned and staged (the cameraman in the bedroom filming one of Julia's daughters in bed having sex - or make it look like it - with her boyfriend: really?! Not to mention the dialogue). Lots of money but little good taste in both style and behaviour. Julia wants to rule everyone's life; she has a God complex. Silvio, Robert and Ben are the only characters that inspire sympathy.",/review/rw7150214/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2021,kgft,6," An obnoxious woman with a worthy goal
","For those who condemn her for attacking an entire group, watch the documentary One of Us, also on Netflix. You'll have a better understanding of what she left and why she doesn't want her son to be sucked into that way of life. I think she's going about convincing him in the wrong way, but maybe, hopefully, by the end of the series I'll be proven wrong. I agree with her that fundamentalism in any religion is a huge problem. We see it with American right wing Christians, Myanmar Buddhists, Middle Eastern Muslim Al-Qaeda, etc.; they're all putrid peas in the same rotten pod. I fast forwarded through all the fashion world junk. Other than a few brief scenes it was irrelevant.",/review/rw7150214/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2021,damatk2568-179-380636,4," Hypocritical much
","I find the women very hypocritical. She is completely intolerant, and at times disrespectful, of people not feeling like she does, but she wants complete tolerance and respect of herself and whatever she believes. She projects this on her own children and even in manipulative ways. She pushes her beliefs on everyone, even when it's clear it's not what they want or are comfortable with. She's way too imposing on her daughter's married life. The youngest daughter is an arrogant entitled brat. Another irony of all this, is that her current lifestyle is made possible by her now-husband, who owns the business...so she's still beholding to a man.",/review/rw7150214/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2021,srooks1,1," The rich aren't different
","My Unorthodox Life is reality television at its worst. None of the family members is likeable; they all live in an unreal world of wealth. They believe their crises are earth-shaking, but their problems are not the stuff of high drama. This series shows shallow people living a self-centered life. There is no need for a second season because there is nothing more to learn
about this family.",/review/rw7150214/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2021,judalipman,1," CRINGE
","Overall felt staged and very uncomfortable to watch. Julia Haart is very controlling and pretends to be ""woke"" and super understanding, yet she refused to allow her younger son to pursue his dreams by studying Judaism.",/review/rw7150214/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2022,Watcher85,1," Why did I watch this? ðŸ™„
","I've never gotten through a season so fast. It's easy when you fast forward the annoying people in the show. From snotty, unsupportive Basheva, to irritating Robert, it's all just bad. (Although I'll give props to him for answering every frantic phone call from Julia.)Throwing in Miriam's Swedish girlfriend is just another storyline that's neither needed or interesting.",/review/rw7150214/?ref_=tt_urv

16 July 2021,kymora,10," Entertaining
","I enjoyed it. I am guessing most of the hate is coming from people within very structured religions. They seem more down to earth than the kardashians and less drama. Is it scripted? Probably, they all are. But its there to entertain and delivers and is interesting to see one person's story.",/review/rw7150214/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2021,Lexilikes,7," Addictive
","Ok so it's not a 10 but I want to bump up the rating because I'm 5 episodes in and actually love it. It's like watching the start of the new kardashians. It's kind of dated and awkward but I literally can't look away, I just want to watch more and more.",/review/rw7150214/?ref_=tt_urv

21 July 2021,ginjaninja-43907,2," Yuck
","I saw someone write a review stating all the hate must be coming from religious people. No, I can assure you it's not. These people are shallow and Julia is a hypocrite. I tried for two episodes and I had to force myself to finish the second. She is constantly imposing her Opinions on everyone yet claiming to be open minded. I don't think I could spend 10 minutes in a room with this person.",/review/rw7150214/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2021,thenonminimalist,1," Mind numbing lies
","So let me see if i get this: a 43 year old woman with a small ""escape fund"" and zero education and/or ties in the fashion industry, escapes her ultra-orthodox jewish family. With the tiny sum she saved up she starts an international(!) shoe brand. Within a year this brand is sold to a major lingerie brand and she, again - still no relevant education or lifelong experience, is named creative director of said brand. A short while after, she's appointed CEO of a global modelling agency. What an inspiring, self-made woman!",/review/rw7150214/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2021,virginia-913-95834,2," Missed the mark - One long ad and Appears Scripted
","I usually love these sort of shows. This one somehow just misses the mark. How does a woman - in several months after leaving her fundamentalist community - suddenly live in a multi million dollar house in Tribeca and grab a CEO position, with no education? Conversations with her family members appear scripted, and the show is one long ad for Julia Harrt enterprises. Although she really is amazing - the show doesn't make clear that her husband is the one with the money (he was CEO of La Perla who brought her in and is also the owner of the current company - although I had to look that up because it isn't apparent from story editing). This series could have been so good. But it rubs off as inauthentic and forced.",/review/rw7150214/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2021,jbruce-39552,2," Great story, wasted format
","I agree with all the 1 star reviews; control freak, Kardashian wannabes, unfair treatment of an entire community, etc. I think it's a shame, because on paper it's a really compelling story. Could have made a great documentary series or movie, but they chose a ""realty"" tv format. Totally makes them look cheap and petty.",/review/rw7150214/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2021,mercuri316,10," Orthodox community clearly lashing out
","There's been a very obvious smear campaign from the Orthodox community against this show and Julia Haart. Reading the reviews, there are several claiming that everything she says are lies, which I'm sure also happened to Deborah Feldman when her book ""Unorthodox""(& later Netflix mini series) were released. These women have the right to speak their truth & it's a shame (but no surprise) that the community has responded this way in an attempt to silence them.",/review/rw7150214/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2021,chikyriky,1," Wannabe famous ew
",Julia is the perfect example of a bully- shaming someone/ something just to pick herself up and gain popularity. She is bashing an entire community (that is already oppressed and hated) just to gain a few minutes of fame.,/review/rw7150214/?ref_=tt_urv

14 July 2021,zarine-09562,1," Pathetic attempt at trying to be the new Kardashians
","My unorthodox life needs to be fact checked. It was clearly dramatized for shock value. Everyone is entitled to make their own life choices but shaming an entire community and spreading lies is not only Anti Semitic under the guise of "" fundamentalism"" its outright slander. The show is disrespectful to the people who actually did escape cults and were abused. Netflix please better educate yourself next time. Its also boring and uneventful.",/review/rw7150214/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2021,Short_and_to_the_point,2," I wonder how many people they harassed until someone picked up this show?
",So I got up to halfway through episode 3 and now I can't go on. Yawn. It's the same thing every ep. She whinges about her past. There's models. Her kids have different opinions... blah blah.

20 July 2021,luckydoola,10," Keep it going!! Push for change!!
",This show is fantastic! It really shines a light on how toxic fundamentalism is and you can clearly see that it is triggering a lot of people because of it (see all the 1 star reviews to discourage others to watch it). I love how genuine Julia is and have mad respect for how much she went through to get herself out of a culture that keeps women suppressed. I also love how strong her daughter Miriam is now that she is able to be herself. It's wonderful to see people standing up and shining a light on these archaic practices that keep women as uneducated baby making factories.,/review/rw7150214/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2021,deevh,10," I liked it
","Addictive show. It's a reality show but I found the people kinda likable and smart and for the most part sweet, if super materialistic, etc. The religion part was interesting in how all the kids were affected differently and the young son is shared custody. The ex-husband seemed pretty reasonable and nice. I dont watch tons of reality tv and found myself wondering how much of everything is orchestrated by the producers and how much the various characters get paid, etc.",/review/rw7150214/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2021,vpavlicevic,8," Please don't listen to the 1 star reviews, clearly agenda from the Orthodox community
","So I have been enjoying this show for quite some time. It is far from perfect but very enjoyable and inspirational. Then I went to see the imdb rating, expecting it to be around a 7.5. However to my shock it has a 4.3 rating, so I started reading the reviews and most of them are un argumented 1 star reviews. Cleary a butcher job from the Orthodox community that felt called out. 1st of all the leading lady Julia is an inspiration to many. She came from a very traditional fundamentalist background, and rose like a phoenix and made herself the successful self made woman head of Elite World Management that she is. Is she controlling and stubborn? Perhaps. But she does know better than most of her children what is good for them, and only wants the best as is clear that many of them are still suffering and under influence of the fundamentalist mentality they grew up in. For example, Aron thinks that he wants to live a life of Religion, but only because he knows nothing else and is not even allowed to explore it or even talk to girls, he is only 14 and has literally been brainwashed since he was a baby. You can literally see Julia breaking down crying realizing he has probably fallen in too deep into the abyss of fundamentalism and religion to be rescued. Its very sad. Batsheva on the other hand is half baked, she is trying to come out of her religious shell but at the same time she has her husband who is guilt-tripping her for wearing jeans and other nonsense of the sort, yes really have to wonder who is in the wrong here! So all in all, not the best reality show on TV but very interesting context and an enjoyable and inspirational watch of an uber successful woman who is trying to save her family from the claws of fundamentalism. I recommend it to anyone who is opening his/her eyes regarding organized religion and the damaging limiting effect it has on human personal life.",/review/rw7150214/?ref_=tt_urv
