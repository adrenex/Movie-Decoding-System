4 February 2002,bob the moo,," Figgis blurs the lines between good and bad in this dark thriller
","Dennis Peck is a street cop who seems happy to stay at that level, and yet he spends significantly more money than he makes on his cops' pay.  When IA officers investigate Peck's partner Van Stretch for planting drugs on a suspect and using unnecessary force, they decide to look into Peck more. However Peck knows how to exploit weakness in those around him and begins to clear up the loose links around him while pushing all Raymond Avila's buttons.",/review/rw3181724/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 1999,baumer,9," Mind games. Manipulation. Corruption. Welcome to the world of Dennis Peck.
","I have never quite seen a movie like this before.  In it, Richard Gere plays his most sinister role and I think his best character in years.  There are many disturbing elements in this film and most of them are perpetrated by Richard Gere's Dennis Peck.  He knows how to manipulate people to get what he wants and if that doesn't work he uses other measures.",/review/rw3181724/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2019,imseeg,6," Richard Gere is a macho dirty cop. Andy Garcia is a macho good cop, trying to nail Richard Gere for his crimes. Who has got the bigger pecker?
","Macho fight between two cops. A good one and a dirty one. Testostoron is flying around big time. That macho characteristic is simultaneously the strength, yet also the weakness of this story about a dirty cop, who is manipulating his way out of a conviction, with a lot of dirty tricks.",/review/rw3181724/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2010,bkoganbing,6," One Amoral Cop
","In Internal Affairs LAPD cop Andy Garcia finds himself transferred there and finds out despite the snow job given him, it's quite true nobody likes these people in the department. He's going to be even less popular because his first assignment with new partner Laurie Metcalf is to investigate William Baldwin, a guy he went through the Academy with.",/review/rw3181724/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2006,livinitup2589,7," Internal Affairs: A tense, fearless police thriller and a showcase for Richard Gere.
","Internal Affairs is a thriller with a lot of nerve. It takes risks, presenting the audience with a grim and violent story of police corruption. It doesn't care if you like it or hate it, just that it does its job of getting under your skin. The main reason the movie is so effective is because of Richard Gere's powerhouse performance. It caught me off guard, since before I saw it I'd always seen him as the hero or love interest, far from the territory he's in here. I'll get more into Gere's performance later, just let me clear up the plot.",/review/rw3181724/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2007,buzznzipp1995,8," A cop 'outside'. I.A.D. on the case.

28 May 2001,gridoon,7," A top-of-the-line Gere performance.
","The subject here (police corruption) is banal, but it gains extra value and weight by Figgis' atmospheric direction and, especially, by Richard Gere's powerful performance in perhaps his most atypical role (and as far as I know, his only truly villainous one). After watching him in this film, I don't know how some people can still doubt that he's a talented actor as well an attractive star. The rest of the cast is also good. The finale, however, is somewhat disappointing.    (**1/2)",/review/rw3181724/?ref_=tt_urv

21 May 2012,Tweekums,7," Richard Gere plays against type in the interesting thriller
","'Internal Affairs' has two protagonists; Dennis Peck, an LA street cop who is highly regarded and has opted to stay on the streets rather than climb the promotion ladder and Raymond Avilla and cop who has just joined the Internal Affairs Division. Avilla's first case involves Peck's partner Van Stretch, a man accused of planting drugs on a suspect... and an old friend of Avilla's. After a run in with Peck, Avilla has a feeling that he may be dirty too, the more he hears the more convinced he is but he will need far more evidence if he is to go up against the force's poster boy. With plenty of evidence against Stretch he offers him a deal if he will name other dirty cops. He says no but later tells his wife he is going to take the deal; a mistake since she was with Peck at the time. Peck arranges for Stretch to be killed; there is still no evidence against him though. As the investigation continues Peck starts to goad Avilla, insinuating that he has slept with his wife... a suggestion that gets just the reaction Peck wanted. The closer the investigation gets to Peck the more dangerous it gets for Avilla and his partner as Peck is owed favours by a lot of people.",/review/rw3181724/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2013,Scarecrow-88,9," Internal Affairs
","Right before Pretty Woman (1990), Gere played smarmy, womanizing, multi-divorced, prick LA street cop, Dennis Peck, taking money from the likes of pimps and drug-dealers in order to provide for his four wives and nine (!) kids. Peck likes to spread the seed around. He's in for a rude awakening when young Hispanic Internal Affairs agent, Raymond Avilla (Andy Garcia) investigates Peck's partner, Van Stretch (William Baldwyn), prone to violent outbursts and other criminal activities. Avilla wants Peck and hopes to get Van to turn on him. Peck not only takes money for prostitution and drugs but also negotiates executions, as is the case with a businessman's parents! Peck isn't about to not only take money and arrange gangbangers to execute the businessman's parents but feels free to bang the guy's wife as well! When Peck realizes the threat to his livelihood, he makes it a mission to torment Avilla, provoking his jealousy in regards to a wife (a smokin' Nancy Travis; I'm telling you, Travis has never been this foxy!) needing some lovin' (knowing Peck's reputation as a womanizer, Avilla does feel a sense of uncertainty because his overworking nature to find evidence against the smart-aleck, no-good cop leaves little time for a wife wanting affection and attention from her husband) and removing anyone that might point a finger at his direction.

18 August 1999,ary,," A sexual and psychological battle is set by Figgis.
","This intelligent and well-directed thriller has some brutal, extremely violent scenes, but what makes you really come closer to the tension created by this original and realistic plot is the psychological confrontation among the two main characters, and Mike Figgis works out on it,settling the battle in the sexual and physical aspects,what is evident in the second meeting of Garcia and Gere:Raymond Avila (Andy Garcia, who develops his role in a silent, but extremely lowering form) is a correct, honest Internal Affairs' agent, and he receives the mission to investigate Dennis Peck (Richard Gere, in what can be easily pointed as his best career's performance), a corrupt,charming and cruel cop who has a lot of ex-wives and sons.The moment in which Peck and Avila are together breaks out an explosive hostility: Peck starts to talk about family, and suddenly touches in a sensitive issue, Avila's  wife.Avila doesn't like Peck's provocation, and hits him.The battle is set.This scene is very thrilling and memorable.The sound track and the photography contribute to build a hot and agile rhythm. Internal Affairs is an entertaining and interesting movie, and if you liked Q&A and The French Connection, you will enjoy it!",/review/rw3181724/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2000,Afracious,10," A superlative, obsessive and seductive cat-and-mouse thriller
","Richard Gere and Andy Garcia are the two conflicting lead characters in this superlative cop thriller. Garcia plays Raymond Avilla, an Internal Affairs officer who has just started in a new precinct to work with his new partner, Amy Wallace (Laurie Metcalf). His first case leads him to suspect another officer, Dennis Peck (a committed, nasty and brilliant performance form Gere, who has never been better), is involved in illegal activities. Soon after, Peck realises that Avilla is on his trail, and starts to confront him with boasts of how he his going to take his wife, and Avilla punches him. These scenes are great. Avilla is the clean-cut guy and Peck is immoral without any remorse. You really get to despise Peck in the film, he even kills people on the side for money and protects hookers. The film rolls along with a seductive and sensuous flair as Peck meets Avilla's beautiful wife, Kathleen (Nancy Travis), and Avilla thinks she has slept with him. The scene after this where Avilla confronts her in the restaurant is a classic. The film then builds to a gripping final showdown scene. The motif on the video for this movie is ''charming, seductive and deadly'', and I have to agree. It is a gripping, classy and entertaining thriller.",/review/rw3181724/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2000,AlabamaWorley1971,8," Probably Richard Gere's best-ever performance.
","Meet Dennis Peck, a real live sociopath. And he's got a badge and a gun. This character might be one of the most truly evil creations in the movies. On the surface, he seems like a terrific guy, a wonderful dad who plays with his kids on his days off. Even his ex-wives like him. But he's used his influence and his skill at manipulating people to create a virtual empire of wealth and power. Andy Garcia is excellent as Raymond Avila, who stumbles across this web and begins to dismantle it. The level of supporting actors is fantastic, much better than most movies. Standouts include Nancy Travis as Andy's wife, Laurie (""Roseanne"") Metcalf as his partner, and a young William Baldwin as Peck's partner. I rate this movie 8 out of 10.",/review/rw3181724/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2011,seymourblack-1,8," Gere's Brilliant As A Truly Exceptional Villain
","On the face of it, ""Internal Affairs"" is a routine crime drama about an investigation into the activities of an LAPD cop who's suspected of being corrupt. What elevates this movie to another level, however, is a sensational performance by Richard Gere as an extremely memorable villain who's not only corrupt, cruel and complex but also extremely manipulative and murderous.",/review/rw3181724/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2013,Mr-Fusion,7," Gere makes off with this movie like a thief in the night
","""Internal Affairs"" is a solid cop thriller with a great cast; not only the two leads, but also with notable performances from Nancy Travis and Laurie Metcalf. It's a wicked game of psychological warfare as I.A. detective Andy Garcia goes up against corrupt LAPD cop Richard Gere. But Gere isn't the usual bribe-taking sort of dirty. No-ho-ho, he's the kind of villainous monster that plays mind-games, manipulates and torments his enemies. ",/review/rw3181724/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2010,AlsExGal,5," It held my interest on the weirdness factor alone...
","... but I don't think I'd care to see it again. This is a weird one with so many preposterous premises that it could almost be a strange kind of fantasy if it was not for all of the mental and physical cruelty going on. In that way, it reminds me of a film from the year before - 1989 - called ""Blue Steel"". As ridiculous as the plot is, you can see the end, and about everything in between, coming at you a mile away.",/review/rw3181724/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2015,g-bodyl,8," A Routine, But Thoroughly-Enjoyable Cop Thriller!
","Internal Affairs is really nothing new and it adds no interesting takes to an already worn-out genre of cops. That being said, this is a watchable film thanks to Richard Gere's crazy performance. There is plenty of action and creative scenes of dialogue. Despite the worn-out tropes, the film is thrilling at times and even downright scary, which is a plus for an action-thriller.

30 June 2020,MOscarbradley,8," One of the best cop movies of the last 30 years.
","It's always been something of a mystery to me that Mike Figgis was never one of Hollywood's major players. Apart from ""Leaving Las Vegas"" his films always seemed to slip under tha radar. ""Internal Affairs"" was his second film after the excellent ""Stormy Monday"" and it's still one of the best cop movies of the last thirty years and it gave Richard Gere one of the best parts he ever had, as charming and sexy as ever but with a mean streak as wide as the Grand Canyon. He's the bad cop that good cop Andy Garcia is out to nail and he's terrific in the role, (I wish he had played a villain more often). Garcia's pretty good, too and there's a very good supporting turn from Laurie Metcalf as Garcia's partner. But ultimately it's Figgis' taut handling of Henry Bean's first-rate screenplay that keeps ""Internal Affaris"" bubbling along. This is great entertainment; funny, exciting and razor-sharp and it's a shame it isn't better appreciated.",/review/rw3181724/?ref_=tt_urv

29 March 2015,paul2001sw-1,6," Nicely directed, shame about the script
","Films about cops investigating cops are a common currency, but in Mike Figgis's early thriller, 'Internal Affairs', there are already signs of the director's distinctive approach: the almost symbolic way in which the characters are depicted, the way the scenes are framed and the use of music, which Figgis co-wrote. The problem with the film is rather the plot: has any real suspect in an investigation attempted to throw the investigator off the trail by encouraging sexual anxieties in him by making designs on his wife? Another problem is that the said suspect is played by Richard Gere: Gere's character becomes increasingly psychotic as the film develops, but incongruously never losing his trademark suaveness. By the end, it's a bit of a mess: at one point the female lead accuses the male protagonists of effectively staging a dick-swinging contest, but the final scene is effectively exactly one of those, with even Andy Garcia's ""good cop"" acting with apparent total disregard for the well-being of his wife (who he has, it should be noted, hit in public earlier in the movie): the film becomes increasingly unpleasant and decreasingly plausible as it progresses. Still, the first signs of Figgis's talent are undoubtedly there, even if the script is decidedly not.",/review/rw3181724/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2008,moonspinner55,6," Memorable, gripping drama; one of Gere's best...
","Director Mike Figgis plugs this otherwise-routine cop thriller with a palpably sweaty charge; he skillfully works the audience up in a fever over material that is pretty standard. Andy Garcia and Laurie Metcalf, working together for the Internal Affairs division on the Los Angeles police force, attempt to nab psychotic cop Richard Gere, who has been leaving a trail of dead bodies throughout the city. The film's first-half is best, weaving an intriguing pattern with some nicely drawn characterizations; the rest of the movie is little more than a violent TV show, creaking a bit under the weight of clichés and contrivances. Still worth a look, however, and the three leads are exceptional. **1/2 from ****",/review/rw3181724/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2005,flicklover,6," Stylish, but ultimately average thriller!!!
","This film was tailor made for Richard Gere. I have always thought that even though he's a decent actor, he is at his best when he plays cold, evil characters. Basically, Andy Garcia plays an ambitious IAD cop that is out to get Gere who is a dirty cop. This would be a spoiler but since the trailers already gave this up I find no problem in revealing it!!! I wouldn't really call it a thriller because there is no mystery as to who Gere is. The movie is really a study of the 2 cops. Gere is the obvious villain, but he fancies himself as a loving family man who loves children. On the other hand Garcia is married , with no children and seems to be cold and self-centered. Even though the movie puts him as the quote hero, he really isn't a likable guy, he neglects his wife, he is also presented as a Latin macho guy. I guess that Mike Figgis wanted the ""2 sides of the same coin"" thing between Gere and Garcia. It works to a point, but there comes a point in the film where it all gets a little too ridiculous to be really effective. Gere gets to a point that he is so bad that you would think that all he would need is to grow horns!!! It is more style than substance. The movie is never boring, it keeps your attention , but is not truly engaging. The saving grace is Laurie Metcalf, she plays the ONLY likable character in the film. It isn't great, but it is entertaining on a sleazy soap opera level.",/review/rw3181724/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2015,Cinemaniac1984,8," Excellent crime thriller. Richard Gere makes an effective villain.
","Audiences are used to seeing Richard Gere as the likable, womanising, good looking pretty boy on screen. Look no further than such movies as An Officer and a Gentleman (1982) and Pretty Woman (1990) and these are the few movies that Richard Gere has built his career on. Internal Affairs is a totally different movie for him in which he does a 180 and portrays a very unlikeable villain.",/review/rw3181724/?ref_=tt_urv
