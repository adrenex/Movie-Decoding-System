14 August 2007,planktonrules,9," Despite the crudeness and stupidity, it's an amazingly insightful film
","I loved this film and it's obvious I am in the minority. This film was marketed in only six cities and it bombed--going almost straight to DVD after its eventual release. I assume much of the reason it failed is that although the film appears stupid and crude (after all, it was created by the same guy who made BEVIS AND BUTTHEAD), but the central message was actually pretty deep and the audience didn't fully appreciate its depth.",/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2019,kosmasp,7," Are we there yet?
","Was this a missed warning sign? The current climate in America is kind of portayed here. Though some would argue, that it doesn't depict all of America, not even just the one side who seems to have a glutton for punishment and seems to like to vote against their own interests. So while there is some relevance to current events, this go far out.",/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2020,rocknrelics,9," It's coming true, but earlier than predicted!!
","A wonderful film that really takes the Michael out of a future dumbed down society, but that sad fact is, so much of today's society can be seen in the movie, and we're not that far off the levels of stupidity portrayed in the movie, and it was supposed to happen 500 years hence!! A movie truly deserving of the world cult, it'll only appeal to those who can see the madness of it all, and I can't recommend it highly enough.",/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2007,Eschete,8," Only in America
","Cinematic flaws? Yes. But I don't want to be too long-winded, because I don't want to cushion the shock of what I'm about to say.",/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2013,plan99,10," Accurate? Probably.
",I gave this film 10 out of 10 as it's the most accurate film depiction I've seen of what the future holds.,/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2020,lucifer_over_tinseltown,10," Sick Sixth Sense of the Zeitgeist
","Fourteen years ago this film predicted with exacting accuracy the dumb it down dystopia we would find ourselves mired in in 2020. Were the filmmakers clairvoyant or is the human race just that predictable? It doesn't take a prophet to answer that question. Anyway, it should have won 8 Oscars that year, including best screenplay.",/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2020,ryanhadi,10," Under appreciated
","Look at our world now while you watch this film - every guy wearing more or less the same trendy stuff (wayfarers, polos, chinos and moccasins...the douche package), too many butts on Insta, stupid warmongering dictators ruling countries with the backing of greedy capitalists...the list can go on. Idiocracy has summarised that ahead of its time in the best way possible.",/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2013,claudio_carvalho,8," One Day, We Will Reach There
","In 2005, the Private Joe Bauers (Luke Wilson) is an ordinary man with an average IQ. He is invited by Officer Collins (Mike McCafferty) to participate of a classified program named Human Hibernation Project to hibernate in pods for one year with the whore Rita (Maya Rudolph). However Collins is arrested for participating in a prostitution ring and Joe and Rita are forgotten in the pods. ",/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2006,mgmax,7," Satire on exactly what the studio did to it
","A lot of things in this futuristic satire are more theoretically funny than actually funny (though it does have some laugh-out-loud moments) but a lot of that is because it seems to have been cut by the studio to better appeal to exactly the idiots it's mocking. Many situations aren't allowed to develop, there's obvious overdubbing of expository material, and worst of all a narrator explains EVERYTHING (most of which needs no explanation), probably because some preview audience didn't understand what was going on. In other words, a movie about dumbing down has been... you guessed it.",/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,gortx,," Too soon? or, too late?
","IDIOCRACY (2006). When this film came out, it was looked at as a broad satire of how infantile our culture could become. Now? Events may already overtaken it and made it seem too mild!",/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2006,michaelplewa,8," This is the beginning of a marketing mystery
","There's no other word for it...Fox dumped this out, with NO marketing of any kind. Nobody in the country, other than those who have been looking forward to this film, know anything about it. All the red flags have flown. It has to be a mess, it can't be anywhere near as good as Office Space, right? Wrong. Though Office Space it ain't, this film definitely has satirical bite and wit. It's a misfire on certain levels, but who's to blame is left to mystery.",/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2020,adamjdavis-91950,10," Nostradamus would be proud.
","28/08/20 and just watched this for the second time, first time being the release year.
Wow.
The only thing they got wrong is the time line.
The world didn't have to wait so long for the youth to become drrrrrrr.
So it's a 10 out of 9 for me.",/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv

5 July 2017,rkhen,8," A ""pre-documentary""; scary-prescient.
",Saw this for the first time tonight; almost creeped out how accurate it is. Or was? (It was released over ten years ago.) ,/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2006,booneh,8," The scariest movie I have ever seen
","""Idiocracy"" is the latest film to come from Mike ""Office Space"" Judge, and it certainly follows a similar theme of that film in the fact that it is an observation of stupidity and how mediocrity can overcome adversity... relatively speaking. It is a story about Joe Bauer (Luke Wilson), who is, quite literally, the most average guy in existence. Joe, and a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph), become the test subjects for a military project of a hibernation chamber. They were to remain suspended for only one year, but due to lack of oversight, Joe and Rita are forgotten about and accidentally wake up 500 years in the future.",/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2006,NJtoTX,8," Intelligent film about a future without intelligence
","First, let me say that although I generally appreciate Mike Judge's work, I've been merely tepid in my response to Office Space, King of the Hill, and Beavis and Butthead. I generally prefer more intelligent comedy, and therein lies the irony with respect to Idiocracy.",/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2006,motherfather,9," Iddiocracy - Two D's for a double dose of comedy

19 January 2018,rogun-35750,9," And we have arrived...
","I saw this film in 2006, after a friend recommended it to me. Back then, I considered it an interesting commentary on society, but one that was too exaggerated to really mean much.",/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2020,larrymerchant,8," Required Viewing, Particularly Now
","I don't understand low ratings for this movie. Know that the studio didn't want it and didn't like it. I think most of the voice-over is studio-added because they didn't think the audience could understand the movie without help. Please watch it, even pay for it over free movies with your service. I'll be surprised if you don't thank me, surprised and disappointed.",/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2019,virtualimmigrant,9," This Film Was Funnier Ten Years Ago
","'Idiocracy' was released as absurdist comedy in 2006, but in 2019 this film has obtained almost horror film qualities, and looking how the society is developing at this point, the film's portrayal of the future might be quite accurate. Especially when you are thinking about those young people fresh out of college turning in their CVs with grammar and spelling mistakes.",/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2006,Tecun_Uman,10," Destined to become another Mike Judge Cult Classic
","Most people are totally unaware that this movie exists. Fox, which paid Judge to make it, has kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it. I guess that made many people think it was one of the garbage movies being flushed in late summer. Well, I am here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look at a future that is not that hard to believe. Basically, Judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are outbreeding the smart by a wide margin. Then these stupid are getting more stupid, by basically spending all of their time watching TV and having sex, which produces more stupid people. By 2500, a person of average intelligence today, will appear to be a genius, that talks ""all faggy."" Seriously, is this really that hard to believe. Oh sure, this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid, but still plausible. Luke Wilson is great as the time traveling army guy, hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time. Where this story will gain its cult status is with the numerous funny one-liners, like ""can we family style her"" and ""hey man, I'm 'bating here!"" This is a funny movie and a rather sharp social commentary on an American society that seems to be fatuated with self pleasure, comfort and stupidity, and I guarantee you that I will be buying this on DVD the first day it comes out and watching it over and over.",/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2020,bneff-03936,10," Better every 5 years
","Seriously the more time passes, the better this movie becomes. It's just slightly less of a comedy and more of a documentary every few years.",/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2019,aglowacka,10," a documentary that should win all the movie awards!
","This movie was supposed to be a comedy about a far future in XXVI Century. From the perspective of 2019, it is a documentary of contemporary society proving that the biggest damage has already been done.",/review/rw1468634/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2006,Russman-3,9," Loved it, one of the funniest movies in 2006
