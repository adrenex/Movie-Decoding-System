25 November 2022,annebouscal,9," Powerful film with credible characterizations
","Based on true experiences of Amish and Mennonite survivors of abuse, it paints a disturbing image of how complicit entire communities can be in victim-blaming and perpetuating a cycle of exploitation. The film title is a little misleading because the eponymous sin knows no religious or socio-economic boundaries.",/review/rw8666877/?ref_=tt_urv

","During the first thirty to sixty minutes of this movie, I screamed and hurled profanity at the screen. Little girls were blamed and punished for men raping them. I wanted to throw the remote at the screen. As a #MeToo survivor, this was heavy for me to take. I threatened to stop watching the movie. So glad I didn't stop. This is a beautiful story of survival. A young Amish girl goes to her parents looking for protection from sexual abuse by a family friend. Both her parents and the community turn away from her and blame her. She eventually bravely leaves her home and goes to the home of English strangers. From these strangers she learns that love is strong, kind and forgiving. She sees a different and wider view of the world which kind of frightens her. She returns home for her mother's impending death. On her deathbed, her mother admits that the daughter is a strong woman and was not responsible for the abuse. After her mother's death, she goes through her hope chest and finds her mother had hopes and dreams of a different life. This revelation strengthens her, and she leaves the Amish community to find out who she is. She becomes eager to know what this huge world has to offer her. She becomes a survivor. I thought this movie was well directed and well acted. The delicate topic was handled with care.",/review/rw8666877/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2022,Boristhemoggy,5," A fantastic story, but a poor film.
","When the film started it was clearly a TV movie so instantly my expectation lowered. And rightly so. This is a fabulous story and I would love to see a full blown Hollywood production of it. Teenage girl rebelling against all her Amish background, family, church and upbringing after suffering abuse is a curtain raiser, and a very eye opening but sad story.",/review/rw8666877/?ref_=tt_urv
