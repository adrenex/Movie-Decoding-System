10 January 2022,jtindahouse,10," The power that perfectly written dialogue can possess
","I love nothing more than when a film that takes place almost entirely inside one room is able to be infinitely more powerful and impactful than a film made on a 200 million dollar budget. It's what movie-making has lost in my opinion, the ability to make magic on paper, rather than by throwing special effects and stunts at the screen willy-nilly. 'Mass' is an incredible film.",/review/rw8463264/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2021,ferguson-6,8," both sides of the table
","Greetings again from the darkness. A normal life is no longer possible. The question becomes, how does one go on in the aftermath of an unimaginable (yet all too common) tragedy that takes the life of one's child? This the feature film debut of writer-director Fran Kranz. He's an actor you'd likely recognize from JUNGLELAND and THE CABIN IN THE WOODS. Rather than choose some lightweight project to kick off his filmmaking career, Franz serves up a gut-wrenching confrontation that would work just as well (if not even better) on stage in live theater.",/review/rw8463264/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2022,MOscarbradley,8," The best acted film of the year.
","""Mass"", in the title of Fran Kranz's excellent debut film, stands for mass murder but it could also mean the Catholic Mass, which is a sacrament, since one of the subjects of this film is forgiveness. Two sets of parents meet in the basement of a church; they are the parents of boys involved in a school shooting, those of the killer and those of one of the victims. What is the real purpose of their meeting? Closure, forgiveness, to vent anger, to divest themselves of pain, to try to understand? Kranz's film covers all of these and is blessed with an extraordinary cast of four. Reed Birney and Ann Dowd are the parents of the killer and Jason Isaacs and Martha Plimpton are the parents of the victim.",/review/rw8463264/?ref_=tt_urv

24 October 2021,Sir_AmirSyarif,8," A breathtaking debut feature
","Fran Kranz's 'Mass' is a breathtaking debut feature about grieving parents that will linger long after the movie is over. The four-person ensemble group delivers fascinating performances while conveying a nail-biting story. Honest, optimistic, and brave, it is profoundly compelling in both the intimacy of its dramatic scope and the universality of the subjects it addresses.",/review/rw8463264/?ref_=tt_urv

30 January 2022,lareval,10," I needed that rewatch
","Upon muy first watch I gave It a solid 7/10. But I kept thinking on this movie, its actors and performances and I rewatched it today. I do not know what on Earth happened to me, but this is truly dramatic beast of a movie. Four people seated around a table will hold your attention and your breathe hostage like the best of thrillers. A masterful movie! 10/10! God bless this rewatch.",/review/rw8463264/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2021,Oktay_Tuna,8," An Extremely Well-Acted Chamber Piece
","Mass is a type of film many people today, wouldn't call a film. Even my father didn't see this as a film but rather as a documentary. The dialogues and the performances are that good. I wouldn't call acting in this film masterful or magnificent. I would just call it real, not realistic. Real. It didn't feel real because if someone were to tell me these things had happened and that they aren't acting I could have believed them. This ""film"" is not for everybody and that's why I am keeping this review spoiler-free so you go in with the right expectations. This isn't a play like 12 Angry Men. What I mean by that is this doesn't feel like it was written by someone. I would even say this is a lesson on ""basic"" writing. You put people in a room and you just let them talk. This film does that extremely well thanks to its not phenomenal but ""real"" cast, meaning performances weren't exaggerated. There is a lot of silence, lots of subtle details and when you start to recognize these things you realize that this may as well be one of the best acted films ever. The writing on the other hand knows how to continue the dialogue which I think is extremely hard, getting from one topic to another especially in the beginning. The writer does that with such ease that the dialogues don't feel scripted. The film is heavy but it doesn't overdramatize which for some people can be a bad thing as it can feel like it is ""too real"". If you want to see a too real table dialogue between 4 ""real people"" then watch this film.",/review/rw8463264/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2021,Alexander_Blanchett,9," Gets under your skin

14 October 2021,FilmFlowCritics,8," A Masterclass in acting!
","This would make a fantastic theatre play, as its exactly that. Sure, some people might say ""why should I watch 4 people sit and talk in a room for 2 hours?"" ...but this is so much more than this. I think I have found my surprise/underdog Oscar nominee here.",/review/rw8463264/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2022,latinfineart,9," Written for adults. So refreshing
","This was not a particularly easy film to sit through, but it was very rewarding. It was so well written and it just felt like it was created for an adult audience. Gen Z would likely not get this film, but those of us who are okay with films that portray tragic stories will find a film like this very fulfilling.",/review/rw8463264/?ref_=tt_urv

","A powerhouse of raw emotions & riveting performances, Mass makes for a heartbreaking & emotionally draining drama concerning two grieving parents who meet to discuss a tragedy involving their sons.

12 February 2022,mattiasflgrtll6,9," A time for healing or prolonged pain?
","Sometimes when tragedy strikes we don't know how to react. Is the appropriate reaction anger? Sadness? Hopelessness? Or a mix of all three? We are shown two sets of parents, the first pair (Jay & Gail) belonging to the son who got shot and the other (Linda & Richard) to the son who killed him. Both are obviously trembling with pain and traumatic feelings from the event, but because they are on the opposite side of the debate can't seem to find a common ground.",/review/rw8463264/?ref_=tt_urv

","In my opinion, this is the best movie since JOKER (2019). I am 43 years old, i haven't cried watching a movie or generally, for a long time, however there are moments here that brought tears to my eyes. They don't make movies like this anymore. This is a hymn to humanity. Every actor is amazing. It's not a flawless movie, but you will not get distracted because of it. Watch it without knowing the plot. The ending of this movie is the definition of ""catharsis"".",/review/rw8463264/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2022,lasttimeisaw,8," Cinema Omnivore - Mass (2021) 7.5/10
","""Now, answering the second question, round two is the distaff side's Dionysian effusion, for two bereft mothers, their aim leans to find a common ground for healing. Gail needs the affirmation that her son's untimely death isn't futile, and forgiveness is the only thing can extricate her family from disintegration. As for Linda, she needs Gail and Jay's understanding to grieve for her son (her son killed himself after the shooting) in spite of the enormity he has committed, and in the absence of her husband, her final reveal of an intense confrontation actually conforms to our suspicion, Kranz sagely leaves the breadcrumbs in the end, the warning signals are there, and Linda truly regrets for her inaction, which is the pragmatic takeaway of this film, how to act with a prescient vigilance.""",/review/rw8463264/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's amazing, important, sad and heartbreaking. It tackles a powerful topic through a beautiful unique simple way. Screenplay is rich, dialogues are nice, touching and deep. Performances by the four leads are Oscar-worthy, the best performances I see this year. It's a film that almost takes place in one location but also emotional enough to keep you fully involved all the time.",/review/rw8463264/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2022,andrewchristianjr,8," HEARTBREAKING.
","Exploring grief, parental responsibilities and the concept of the bad seed, Mass is this very sophisticated indie drama with thought-provoking dialogue that is gripping from start to finish, but it is also a deeply heartbreaking, difficult to watch movie with all four actors channeling anger, pain and discomfort phenomenally. This ensemble was just marvelous. If you can't see yourself, your parents or your child or anyone you know in this conversation, you are not being honest with yourself.",/review/rw8463264/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2021,GrantMoyer23,8," An Outstanding Portrait of Devastation
","Mass tells a heart-breaking story in a way that feels unique in its own way with using interesting editing and dialogue choices that all in all makes it purposeful to see the experience writer/director Fran Kranz has crafted. Performance wise it is filled with considerate actors and actresses that need a lot of attention. And WTF the actresses from The Goonies and Parenthood is in this, and shes amazing. Like come on.
