9 November 2018,JabbaTheHans,9," Hilarious Comedy Centered Around (Possibly) Anime's Strongest Character
","Saiki has ultra strong psychic abilities, which makes me dare say that he is the most powerful anime character of all time (even more powerful than One Punch Man or Goku). However, trying to live your life as an ordinary kid among ordinary people will surely produce so much tension-- which is the where The Disastrous Life of Saiki K revolves around.",/review/rw5882838/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2018,invisibleunicornninja,10," Brilliant.
","This is one of the funniest things that I've ever seen, and I watch a lot of comedy. Every single element about this show works, from the great voice acting, to the comedic timing, to the characters, to the magic, to the simplistic art style that helps make the actual animation more intricate and fluid. I would highly recommend watching this show.",/review/rw5882838/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2017,mobinm-mohanan,8," LAUGH OUT LOUD!! The ""Most Underrated"" Anime of 2016.
","Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan(TV) AKA 'The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.' is a Japanese gag anime based on the manga of the same name by Shūichi Asō. Kusuo Saiki is a high school student who was born with all manner of psychic abilities, including telepathy, psychokinesis, teleportation, and more. Despite having all these powers, Saiki faces all kinds of hardships and tries to avoid attention as much as possible. The story follows Saiki as he attempts to secretly use his powers to live a normal high school life while dealing with his less than ordinary classmates at P.K. Academy.

20 July 2019,mrsupermoiveman,9," Almost a perfect anime
",My god I had such a fun time watching this anime. The japanese humor in this series is just gold. Mainly focusing on beeing non enthusiastic in every situation which to me is hilarius. But of you don´t really like anime or thinking about trying this as your first it might not be a good idea. Definetly not for everyone. Only thing that did not give it 10 stars was that some episodes where really not that great compared to others.,/review/rw5882838/?ref_=tt_urv

","One day I was scrolling through netflix and that's when I saw disastrous life of saiki k and it sounded really ironic but I was dead wrong this show is most funniest anime I have seen in my life, i have watched this show three times and every time has been incredible",/review/rw5882838/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2019,phanthinga,10," Farewell (from now) Saiki Kusuo you will be missed
",I just watch The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. Final Arc a 2 episode special that meant to be the finale of this brilliant comedy show and let's just say the big cliffhanger of the finale leave a lot to be desired cause in the end Saiki still got his psychic abilities despite his attempt to get rid of it once and for all to live peacefully as a normal human being so naturally it kinda weird for an anime to end with such unsatisfied ending but there also two chapter left from the manga that answer that question and open for a potential new story so I hope once day we can all see a new misadventure of Saiki and his friend in college,/review/rw5882838/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2020,kwesib-32179,10," Funniest anime since Gintama.
","Saiki K is one of anime's greatest comedies that is less known despite being acknowledged as one of the greatest ongoing animes. Check all the funniest animes and I'm shocked to notice that this series still does not have the fame it deserves. It must be on par with gintama. The show appears first not to take itself seriously as most things are rushed through in the early episodes but it does one thing perfectly- makes you laugh on the turn of every single episode. Never have I enjoyed any anime comedy like this. The D.L. of Saiki K made me laugh so hard. The main character Kusuo is not the funniest centre of the show unlike Gintama, school days, or Toradora. The true gold of the show are the side characters: Nendou and co. So much attention is given to a large side characters who never disappoint and really make us laugh our hearts out. For Saiki having such abilities, one will think there will be main villain or something but no. Rarely is there a bad guy threatening the protagonists. Instead the show focuses on the slice of life, and really works on the comedy. What I like about this comedy is that it doesn't invest too much in parodies such as race jokes, poking other countries, anime titles, movies, etc. Instead the anime focuses on its own unique way of comedy and trust me it will really make you laugh. The animation is great and the pacing is great. However, more sequels should be released quickly because there is a whole lot of great arcs that can be taken from the manga. However, this anime is still stereotypical as art styles for black characters suck hard! Zolbe Kageyukouji is given a terrible art style. His lips for instance is the same as Takahasi's which is described as ugly by everyone in the show. That's very disappointing for these great Japanese shows. Look at Kilik Rung of Soul Eater and some blacks in Bleach. These are worthy of emulation. Zolbe also has those typical stereotypical ghetto character. Japanese artists and writers must really step up because there are a lot of black people who love anime but many turn away in disappointment because of silly blunders like these.Every single episode made me laugh.",/review/rw5882838/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2019,lastmanstand,10," I Found Happiness.
","I was looking for something uplifting, so, my girlfriend suggested this beautiful show to me, and guess what? I binged it like a maniac. The colourful characters and the topsy-turvy life of Saiki K is so enjoyable it can lift anyone up, usually I also keep an eye on the technicalities but I just couldn't while watching it. This show gave me happiness and I can't thank the creators enough!",/review/rw5882838/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2019,trcky1,9," Really funny character and situational humor
","Saiki's powers and introversion compound one another in this comedy series. I love that the episodes are mostly self contained so you can pick up at different episodes without missing too much of the story, although you might miss some of the character profession arcs.",/review/rw5882838/?ref_=tt_urv

10 September 2020,Fatemeh_Hadi,8," It Takes You Back
","Here is what I like about it:
Saiki, when faced with difficult situations, maintains his composure and and takes his time to think. He then carries out the plan with responsibility and care. As the matter of fact almost all the characters do this in all kinds of situations. This might be easily overlooked but the fact is it's astonishing how much improvement could be brought to life if we stopped to think and yet how we far too easily forget about this precious superpower!
This show portraits Japanese etiquette all the time. It is great to see how much care the characters take in their mannerism and behavior. That, it matters to be polite and to avoid hurting people's feelings unnecessarily.
It also reveals some other aspects of Japanese culture such as preferring uncrowded yet very appealing and cosy interior designs, performing social duties, paying attention to details and valuing education.
But most importantly, with this you can travel back and experience being you when you were younger and remember how a lot of things felt back then. For instance, to remember what it is to love your parents, grandparents and friends as a kid, to timidly experience romance as a teenager and to be carefree ;)
It also makes you laugh even if you don't want to!",/review/rw5882838/?ref_=tt_urv

8 July 2020,m_winship,9," Weird Music to be sure!
","This Japanese anime has a very peculiar music genre. It's sort of a 20s Flapper Japanese, pre war jazz? Yes, you must hear to believe how our cultures are so intertwined, as to make flapper sounds, the new Japan Pop music of today! Cheers and keep on dancing 💃 Japanese Flapper style!

",It was really funny to watch saiki k living a life with powers and wanting to live a normal life. I laughed a lot of times watching it and it was hilarious. You think having superpowers is fun but actually it isn't always that good and Saiki k shows that.
