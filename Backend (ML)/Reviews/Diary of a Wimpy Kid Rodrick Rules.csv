8 December 2005,eichelbergersports,7," Cheesy animation; top-notch writing highlight new 'toon
","Despite low-budget animation, the newest feature by the Weinstein Company, ""Hoodwinked,"" is saved by some silly animal and human characters, as well as great writing and hilarious jokes.",/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2007,ccthemovieman-1,8," Looking For A Different Kind Of Animated Film?
","Now here is a modern-day animated film that is hard to classify. It's part film noir, part fantasy, part comedy, part Indiana Jones adventure, part Thin Man detective, on and on. One thing for sure: although kids might like it, this movie is geared more for adults. Even older adults as some of the humor is referenced by classic movies.",/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2006,roccoand,9," Loved Hoodwinked! Hope there is more like it coming!
","A few months ago I was speaking with a friend who runs a drive-in movie theater. He asked me what movies I may want to see when he opens for the season. I remembered seeing ads for ""hoodwinked"" but never caught it in the theater so I told him I'd like to see it. He remembered the film and played it last weekend.",/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2005,MattSteele,10," Stop dogging the animation
","I'm annoyed at all the ""know-it-alls"" on these boards who are judging this film solely based on what they think they see in the trailer.",/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2006,sunk85,7," It's the inside that counts!
","Lots of people bitch about the animation being pretty stone age in this film, and for a reason. Technically, ""Hoodwinked"" is far behind ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Incredibles"". However, if you look past the unpretty exterior, there is plenty of goodies to found inside. Hilarious punchlines and a clever script by far makes up for the lack of jaw-dropping animation. Actually, I found the outdated CGI to add another layer of quirkiness to this little flick! When comparing ""Hoodwinked"" to other recent releases in the genre, it comes out with flying colors. Where ""Chicken Little"" and ""Valiant"" fail, this one really excels! Dialogues are well written and full of treats that makes this one a movie to see more than once. And for once, I even enjoyed the musical numbers, catchy and well performed. It doesn't have any scenes that - like ""Shark Tale"" - fell plastic or numb, instead it's an 80 minute, twisting and turning roller-coaster that doesn't stop until the credits start rolling. All you have to to is buckle up, and enjoy the ride",/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2005,kidkosmic,10," Great on a Curve!
","Hoodwinked is an ultra low budget affair compared to the average 3D CGI-animated film (it was shot for a reported 15 million vs 70 to 90 million for films like Finding Nemo or Shrek 2). If you want a fairer comparison in terms of animation quality, you'd have to look at something like Jimmy Neutron (30 million budget).",/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," Amusing family film about trouble in the hood
","Hoodwinked was an example of a film that was much better than I expected. It is an amusing family film, that kids will definitely enjoy, and as a 17 year old female I too enjoyed it. Yes, it is too short, and the animation isn't always that great. But one thing I did love about Hoodwinked is that it is very funny, many funny lines in the script but one of my personal favourites was ""the singing was good but the choreography was terrible"". The story is a very original one, about a goodie bandit, and the search in the fairy tale world for the real culprit. It is well told, and fizzles with energy. As I said, where the film is least impressive is in some of the animation. Nice colours and backgrounds, but apart from a very clever roller-coaster-like ride on the side of a mountain, it just lacked at times visual invention, and the character animation was a tad awkward. Plus the film at less than eighty minutes is too short. Despite all that, there is a lot to recommend it, the funny script and the story do compensate hugely. Other pros are the very groovy soundtrack, and a terrific voice cast that include Anne Hathaway, Glenn Close, Jim Belushi, David Ogden Stiers and Patrick Warburton. All in all, not perfect, but very funny and original, so I do recommend it. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv

23 November 2005,BillyGoat3,8," Story and delivery overcome animation flaws
","This is a very fast paced movie that plays to the two levels successful animated films play to: The kids are entertained, but so are the parents. There are zingers that come out of nowhere, some but not all of which are shown on the trailer. Some of those zingers will only catch the attention of the adults in the house, but don't detract from kids' enjoyment. But some will get all generations to laugh, like the ""Run!!!"" sequence from the trailer. A four second bit. ",/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2006,LoneWolfAndCub,6," A great movie that most people should enjoy
","I'm not going to give Hoodwinked a harsh review like so many others. This is primarily a kids movie, nothing more, nothing less. All the kids in the cinema that I was in were roaring with laughter and I must admit at times I was also laughing out loud. Some of the older people and parents will enjoy the references it makes to other movies and fairy tales, although they are dumbed down for the suited audience.",/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2006,groon,10," A fun film--regardless of how it looks.
","I'll confess something up front which seems to be place me in the minority--I didn't go to see this movie hoping for great animation, a break-through in story-telling, or the chance to see self-proclaimed ""artists"" waxing philosophic about their personal world views. I went to have fun and enjoy myself.",/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2007,claudio_carvalho,6," Four Different Versions of a Classic Fairytale
","The recipes of candies of the goody shops have been stolen by the Goody Bandit, and many animals are out of business. While the police are chasing the criminal, there is a mess at Granny's house evolving Little Red Hiding Hood, The Wolf, The Woodsman and Granny, disturbing the peace in the forest and they are all arrested by the inpatient Chief Grizzly. Detective Nicky Flipper is in charge of the investigation, and each accused gives the own version for the incident.

8 August 2021,dmmc-32785,8," one of my favorite movies as a kid... still stands as an adult
","This movie has such great comedic points for both children and adults. First time I saw it I was in 6th grade at the ripe age of 11 and remember laughing so hard I almost peed my pants. Here I am now, 14 years later, and it still brings me such joy. I feel as though this is a comfort movie that provides an excellent twist on a classic fairytale (Shrek style, if I may) that brings joy and amusement. Great for all ages.",/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv

2 August 2006,nobbytatoes,5," a new spin on the old tale
","The old fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood is a staple of the fairy tale stories. Red Riding Hood goes to visit her Granny in the woods, ending up being attacked by The Wolf, with the Woodsman saving the day. Hoodwinked is where the fairy tale ends. After what unfolds in the traditional story, Red, Wolf, Granny and The Woodsman are arrested for conspiracy. Snack businesses throughout the forest have been closing down, with owners secret recipes being stolen; the latest victim The Muffin Man. With each one a suspect, each of their stories are unfolded to reveal the mystery.",/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2006,ebrady-1,10," Awesome - This movie is a hoot and a half!
","I got a sneak peak and had the pleasure of seeing this film at the Cannes Film Festival in May. I was blown away by how clever this movie is. Sparking, fresh witty dialog. Original engaging characters. I was rolling in the aisle. I see a lot (I mean a lot) of movies and this film is better than everything out there. I would highly, highly recommend this to everyone I know. Let me tell you the average everyday movie goer is not looking at all the effects and cgi .. WE LIKE A GOOD STORY - DON'T SELL THAT ASPECT OF A FILM SHORT! Plus their were clever references and homages sprinkled throughout which the any intelligent moviegoer will appreciate. It is refreshing to see an Independent Animated Feature. Someone comment something negative about who was in it. Who cares? Its animation. The story is paramount, I don't care about whose voice it is. Hoodwinked is clever start to finish. I think this film is going to do well at the box office. And I think it will open the world up animation to other independent filmmakers. This film is original and a whole lot of fun.",/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2006,DICK STEEL,7," A Nutshell Review: Hoodwinked
","Anne Hathaway is currently disrobing on our local screens, and I suspect by the time Havoc finished its run, then she'll be heard but not seen, only lending her voice in the animated feature Hoodwinked, by Blue Yonder Films and Kanbar Entertainment. By not being a product churned out from the usual Disney-Pixar-Dreamworks-Fox studios, it's a delightful departure from the expected norms we already have formed by offerings from the mentioned studios.",/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2006,Chris_Docker,6," Aiming at all ages
","You know the murder mystery scenario: that fairytale look of everything in place when things are not really as they seem. Take Little Red Riding Hood, for example (Hoodwinked! does): a granny who 'kicks fanny', a wolf who is more than just a master of disguises . . . everyone has a secret story to tell and characters at the scene are far from being 'the usual suspects'. Detective Flippers has his work cut out restraining the pigs and interrogating everyone through complex flashbacks.",/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2021,elicopperman,6," Charming Indie Spoof on the Red Riding Hood Story
","Back in the mid 2000s when the fairy tale genre had been turned upside down by the mainstream blockbuster Shrek, there was another animated feature that happened to do so as well, only from an independent point of view. Hoodwinked, a low budget CG animated film from Cory & Todd Edwards, Tony Leech and Kanbar Entertainment, was released by the Weinstein Company to polarizing reviews and huge box office receipts, making it a surprise hit for such a small production. So now that it's been well over 15 years since its release, let's see how this low scaled feature managed to age.",/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2006,nickcosto,9," Great for adults and kids alike
",I was shopping for DVD's for my kids lately and my eye caught the cover of Hoodwinked. I thought it strange that I missed this at the cinema because with my preteen kids I have seen just about all the animation movies.,/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2006,Igenlode Wordsmith,7," Better than I had expected
","I wouldn't actually have gone to watch this film of my own accord, but I was roped in to act as juvenile escort for the occasion, and after two goes on consecutive days (the screening times had changed) we finally got to see it. I didn't really like it. But... actually, I can see that it's quite good.",/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2005,shadleym,9," Very entertaining. Definitely worth seeing.
","To me, the animation didn't seem to be quite state-of-the-art, but the movie as a whole was very creative and entertaining. I loved it, as did my wife and my two children (ages 7 and 4). I think the PG rating is appropriate - I don't think it's quite a G, but neither did I have to give a whole lot of parental guidance. I certainly have no qualms about having taken my kids. Very enjoyable for all ages. ",/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2007,disdressed12,8," the true(animated)story of Red Riding Hood(not really of,course)
","forget everything you've heard about ""Little Red Riding Hood"",this is the true story.well,not really of course but is an animated take on the fairy tale.the gist of the story is that the police have been looking for the perpetrator of a series of crimes(non-violent of course),well one crime,actually,committed several times.anyway,a series of events lead the police to 4 suspects:Red herself,(Anne Hathaway)Granny(Glen Close),The Woodsman(Jim Belushi)The Wolf(Patrick Warburton).we are treated to a series of flashbacks,one by each character depicting the events that had transpired according to their own viewpoint.By the way,almost all the characters in the movie,from the police chief on down,are characters mostly from the original rendition of the fairly tale.Some of these characters are quite amusing anyway,through the flashbacks,we are treated to some comedy,action(including some extreme sports)some drama,mystery,and the movie even becomes a musical for a brief time.and there are some suspenseful moments.there are also some scenes of mild to moderate peril,so it might be a bit too much for very young children,otherwise it all adds up to one very entertaining experience suitable for(generally)the whole family.as well,it is also unpredictable,right until nearly the very end,when the perpetrator is finally revealed(it is not who you might think).finally, all the actor's voices really went well with their respective roles.truly a wacky,unique tale on the Red riding Hood Fable. 8/10",/review/rw1443004/?ref_=tt_urv
