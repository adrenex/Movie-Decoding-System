",The Quintessential Quintuplets is one of the most enjoyable harem anime that I can think of right now and before We Never Learn come out it safe to say that the anime maybe my favorite harem anime in a long time. I encourage people that don't like the genre for the heavy fan-service and a dumb storyline that goes nowhere to give this anime a chance because this anime have little to none of that when this time it got a wholesome story and a straightforward main character that we all can roots for to enjoy. It still got some of the old cliche scene that bout to happen because it still a harem anime at the core but all of them handle well and never leave a bad taste in your mouth. I don't know if this anime ever get a second season or not so I highly recommend read the manga at well because trust me after the end of ss1 things can only get better from there,/review/rw6593412/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2019,invisibleunicornninja,7," Pretty fun.
","I'm not a massive fan of slice of life, but I instantly became interested in these six extremely well-written characters. Watching the main guy trying to figure out how to teach the girls is very entertaining. Also, this show surprisingly doesn't really have any fanservice shots, leaving more time to focus on the characters.",/review/rw6593412/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2021,ThomasP909,9," Don't waste your time go and watch it
",I am shocked at how good season 2 has been. It seems like this is just a really well written rom com with 4 girls who all love the mc. Its not a cliche harem at all. Trust me please watch it I would say that now it's definitely a must watch series.,/review/rw6593412/?ref_=tt_urv

28 March 2021,darkosdicky,10," Very good
","Anyone who hates this anime I'm confused. This anime is really perfect for singles who don't have a clear direction in their life. Always when I watch this somehow I smile myself like an autistic person. That's because in my brain, I'm happy like I feel that so many girls come to me. IRL might not be like that, but I hope that Amen can be like that. The animation per character is very different from other anime. Each character has a rich feel, so it's really boring. The virtual design and hair are really great, thx negi, for making these beloved characters. The song is delicious too, and I won't be bored to hear it. 10/10, this anime is no debate. I love this anime to death.",/review/rw6593412/?ref_=tt_urv

15 April 2021,kushroman,10," Best rom-com genre anime on the market
","This is not a harem so don't get the wrong idea but this is a very soothing love story with a twist of humor and suspense
The screenplay is amazing and all the characters seem very real
The story at first is not very appealing but as you get through the first few episodes you will indulge in the plot
The basic story revolves around 5 sisters and their bond with each other and the protagonist of the story
This is a high school drama kind of story . I have already finished the manga so i know the entire story and believe me it is worth watching .",/review/rw6593412/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2021,amooorales,10," Great anime
","This is probably my favorite show and this is coming from someone who has watched nothing but shonen and harem anime. I really love the 5 sisters and the nice blend of humor and romance. There is real character development which sets it apart from other harems, usually in a harem all the girls chase after the guy with no real motive but just for the sake of plot but in this show you can see the characters relationship grow and turn into a romance which I really enjoyed. I did not expect this level of complexity of story or characters I literally thought this was going to be another typical harem anime (which I do enjoy too) but this show was a nice change of pace. The MC is ok, his goal constantly affects his relationships with the girls. But he's does things because he cares for the sisters! Miku and yotsuba are both best girls. My favorite anime rn!! Watch it rn!!!",/review/rw6593412/?ref_=tt_urv

","This came out of nowhere. I'm not one to watch anime like this, but saw a random recommendation on Gogo Anime and here I am after bingeing both seasons praising it lol
I'm a bit older so I wasn't sure about the high school aspect but it kept me drawn in and entertained, was really quite surprised as I've tried watching a couple others similar to this but disliked the direction immediately.",/review/rw6593412/?ref_=tt_urv
