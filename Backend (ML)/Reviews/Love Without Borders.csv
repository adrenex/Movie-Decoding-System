12 October 2015,luke-a-mcgowan,9," Brilliantly authentic and deeply touching
","There are about four films that can overcome the ""seen it"" cynicism I have, unlock my heart and make me feel genuine feelings. In other films I can appreciate that the film is beautiful and emotional, but there are only four that can really get to me. The first was Crash, the second was The Green Mile and the third was Boyhood. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl just scored the fourth slot on that extremely small list. Alfonso Gomez-Rejon's film is a beautiful cocktail of wonderful things. Its quirky and charming and witty and touching and somber and delicate and completely beautiful. Its got elements of about six of my favourite films of all time, and the fact that it slam dunked Sundance doesn't even surprise me a bit. ",/review/rw3279435/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2015,somf,9," Enjoyed every moment of this film
","I have to start my review with discussing the inevitable comparisons with ""The Fault in Our Stars"". John Green fans would find it blasphemous to say this is a superior film but it certainly is. I don't think that I can argue that the characters in TFIOS are more realistic, but the whole unique style and quirkiness of MAEATDG make it a true classic of the teen genre like ""The Breakfast Club"" or ""Breaking Away"". It as important as many of the films to which Earl and Greg pay homage with their own hilarious versions.",/review/rw3279435/?ref_=tt_urv

25 September 2015,cosmo_tiger,8," A movie teens should watch. If you liked Fault in our Stars you will love this movie.
","""We're not even friends."" Greg (Mann) is finally a senior. He as survived high school by trying to be invisible to everyone and not causing any drama. When his mother tells him that a classmate (Cooke) has been diagnosed with cancer and that he should hang out with her he hesitates. What starts off as something he is forced to do actually helps him to become who he truly is. If you have teenagers this is a movie they should watch. The movie is a mix of Fault in our Stars and Perks of Being a Wallflower. There is humor and drama in this but the best part about it is that it feels real and nothing about it is forced. The movie could have easily been cheesy and almost after-school-special-like but it stays away from that and becomes something that is truly special. It isn't anything all that original but the writing and acting really make this one of the better movies of this genre and I recommend it. Overall, a movie that could have been very hokey but instead turned out to be very real and heartfelt. A movie teens should watch. If you liked Fault in our Stars you will love this movie. I give it a high B+.",/review/rw3279435/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2015,jbroc62,8," Me and Earl and the Dying Girl: Proof That Laughter Can Help Ease the Pain of Dying
","Me and Earl and the Dying Girl offers a very accessible, honest, and humorous look at not only how someone deals with being diagnosed with cancer, but it also turns the clichés of the coming-of-age story on its nose, and the people behind this film are able to do that by finding the perfect balance between drama and comedy within this unfortunate tragedy.

10 November 2015,Hitchcoc,10," A Gem of a Movie About Why Life Is So Precious
","I saw this film on a four hour flight. I had it on my list of films to see, but I never got around to seeing it. What we have here is a classically gifted child who tries to hide in the bushes. His friend is a down-to-earth black kid who comes from humble roots. His contributions are more basic. He has a seemingly dangerous brother. The star is a filmmaker, taking classics like ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Breathless"" and turning them into truncated parodies. The titles are probably better than the movies. One day, his somewhat overbearing mother, lets him know that a classmate of his, a young woman, has leukemia, and that it would be nice to for him to visit her. He reluctantly goes to see her, and it is only his explanation that his mother will make it hell for him if he doesn't spend time with her. What develops is a fascinating connection between the two and love at arm's length. Earl is only a part time player and not a great factor, other than being a refreshing distraction. What makes this movie so wonderful is the natural development of love and friendship, the realities of the illness, and a slow revealing of truths between the two characters. The movie is funny at times and never maudlin, although it has its dark moments as well. I'd not heard of the kids playing the roles, but they are strikingly poignant in their delivery. Nick Offerman, who is only in a couple scenes, plays the father of the boy. He steals every scene he is in. He is an experimenter with life where the young man experiments with film. See this.",/review/rw3279435/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2015,SLUGMagazineFilms,," Not Just Marketable, But Good Too
","It would be easy to criticize the fact that Me & Earl & the Dying Girl appears to have been genetically engineered to be a summer box office moneymaker (Fox Searchlight and Indian Paintbrush have already snatched up the rights for a record- breaking $12 million). It's an adaptation of a young adult novel about adolescent friendship in the midst of terminal illness, which is hot in Hollywood right now thanks to The Fault in Our Stars. Basically, I went in to this film wanting to despise it for its utter marketability. Upon seeing it, however, I was reminded that movies can be commercially successful and good at the same time—and that's okay. The film chronicles the senior year of Greg (Thomas Mann), his friend Earl (R.J. Cyler), and Rachel (Olivia Cooke), who has been diagnosed with leukemia. Though all of the teen dramedy tropes are present—awkward parents, the teacher who gets it, the exploration of high school cliques—the excellent supporting cast keeps the narrative fresh. Greg's parents (Connie Britton and Nick Offerman) add an eccentric jolt of parental weirdness to their scenes, and The Walking Dead's Jon Bernthal takes archetypal cool teacher role into some original territory with his tattoos and battle- scholar vibe. While I found myself wanting more in regards to Rachel's character, the film's treatment of her friendship with Greg is both darkly funny and realistically somber. This is one movie that it's safe to see regardless of its soon-to-be huge commercial appeal. –Alex Springer",/review/rw3279435/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2016,kosmasp,9," Spoiler in the title?
","Or maybe not. But then again, you have to watch the movie to really know. One thing is for sure: the movie is funny if you like weird humor that is out there. That is really strange and has a strong script (the dialog is amazing, maybe you may think it's too much for some teenagers to talk like that). If you actually thought the fault in our stars movie was good, wait until you get a load of this. And just to be clear, I'm talking about the other movie, not the novel that it was based on, that I never read.",/review/rw3279435/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2015,tomtobias-230-837004,10," Super w Long Shelf Life
","I saw Me & Earl last week at Sundance and have not stopped thinking about it. That is a long (6 day) shelf life. What more can one ask from a film? The writing and execution is elite quality. All scenes seem necessary. Parent/child relationships, peer relationships, teacher/student relationships all are captured in humorous and touching ways. Life and death realities are also visited through the lens of ""kids"" who make as much sense as possible when facing the grim possibilities of severe illness.",/review/rw3279435/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2019,robertemerald,10," Genuinely moving and funny blend of humour and teenage animation
","You'll be enchanted by this movie. It has a wit that easily makes you smile, and that wit continues through most of the movie. The dying girl is the same actress as the girlfriend in Bates Motel tv series, playing a similar role, and is the anchor against which the drama rocks. The characters here are really likeable. The two lead protagonists are humble and yet a source of fantastic creativity, their works bouncing around the film and adding heart and colour to proceedings. It's a highly unusual story, with unexpected rays of sunshine around every corner. I highly recommend Me and Earl and the Dying Girl. It's an easy watch for sure as it is so inspiring, and will be remembered as a classic.",/review/rw3279435/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2015,meeza,10," Loved it! So full of life!!!
","The independent movie ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" is a rich, creative, emotional, and inspiring narrative that is so much more than a tale of a teenager diagnosed with leukemia. Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon no se rajo and orchestrates the picture as a quirky gem still respecting that one of its main characters is in a mortal state; and in no way, shape, or form, disrespects that. The film stars Thomas Mann as Greg, a high school student who evades being part of a click in high school, but not having absolute distant from any of them. RJ Cyler co-stars as Earl, Greg's best friend and also film partner. Greg & Earl make eccentric short films with a pun touch on film classics; which personally I think was masterful. My fav of the bunch was Sockwork Orange, which was bloody hilarious. Anyways, back to the story. Greg's mother pressures him to better befriend & be supportive to Rachel (Olivia Cooke), who has just been diagnosed with leukemia. Greg is hesitant at first, but then a very cool friendship blossoms between Greg & Rachel that sure had lots of life in it. Sure, there are a couple of predictable turns in the movie, but it does not hamper the film in one bit. Young thespians Mann, Cyler, and Cooke were very solid in their performances; most notably Cooke. And I loved the supporting work of the underrated Jon Bernthal as Mr. McCarthy, the unorthodox history teacher who becomes some sort of new wave mentor for Greg. Jesse Andrews' adapted screenplay of his novel is Oscar-worthy and I wish I had Jesse's world of script talent. So liven up your life just a little bit, and go visit ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"". It's the best movie I have seen so far in 2015. ***** Excellent",/review/rw3279435/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2015,StevePulaski,8," A film to remind us that humans, particularly adolescents, aren't as easily defined as we think
","Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann) is an awkward, self-loathing teenager, wandering the halls of his high school with a relaxed and mellow attitude. He's not anti-social, as he goes out of his way to talk to people of all different social groups and cliques, fully intent on never getting too close to call them ""friends"" and operating just basically enough so he can never become fully immersed in their life or embarrass himself. His friend, though he won't call him that, is Earl (Ronald Cyler II), who has been by his side for years, as the two make low-budget parodies of classic films (IE: ""A Sockwork Orange"" is their version of ""A Clockwork Orange,"" Jean-Luc Godard's ""Breathless"" becomes ""Breath Less,"" a film about a man's attachment to his inhaler, and ""Midnight Cowboy"" becomes ""2:48 P.M. Cowboy""). Despite these films blatantly being awful, the two continue their productions for reasons they can't even adequately explain.",/review/rw3279435/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2016,gbill-74877,8," Not idealized, fresh, and funny
","Endearing film about an awkward high school misfit, his friend who makes amateur movies with him, and, well, a dying girl who he begins visiting at the request of his mother. All three leads – Thomas Mann, R.J. Cyler, and Olivia Cooke – turn in strong performances, and while the movie could easily be cloying or derivative of countless others with this sort of subject, it somehow avoids all that. Almost every note rings true, and the characters are far from idealized, expressing the difficult emotions of growing up as well as dealing with cancer. The vantage point – the misfit and not the dying girl – apparently rubs some people the wrong way, but I found it to be part of the movie's truth. And, despite the heavy subject matter, the dialog is fresh and funny, and the amateur movies the kids make are very clever twists on classic films, which injects lightness into the film.",/review/rw3279435/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2016,Turfseer,3," Dying girl becomes inspiration for growth in this manipulative tearjerker
","Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is based on the novel of the same name by Jesse Andrews, who also wrote the screenplay. The film was directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, a one-time assistant to Martin Scorsese. The story is set in Pittsburgh and its protagonist is Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann), a teenager who maintains superficial relationships with most of the cliques in the high school he attends. A good part of the opening scenes involve stuff we've seen before in countless other movies that feature high school kids—there are the usual geeks, Goths and that one good looking girl on whom the main character has a crush. Greg also has hippies for parents with his sociology professor dad dressing often in a sarong and enamored with exotic cuisine, and a mother who is perennially imbibing a glass of wine which undoubtedly helps her be more sociable.",/review/rw3279435/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2021,eric262003,9," Goes Beyond A Dying Child Drama
","To say that ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" is another tear-inducing dying child melodrama doesn't really understand what the story is about. Under the direction of Alfonzo Gomez-Rejon and a script written by Jesse Andrews who also wrote the novel this movie is based on, they have succeeded into touching upon this serious issue without you having to reach for the tissue box every five minutes, while throwing in comical moments at the time that seems fit, and eccentric enough that it doesn't become overkill. There might be few wrong steps in some places, but it won't lower your hopes in watching this movie. In the long run, it balances in the right times as when we should laugh and when we should cry.",/review/rw3279435/?ref_=tt_urv

The dialog was amazing, If you enjoyed fast wit like Juno, then you'll have a blast with this one. It's a must see, and deals with cancer in such a touching way. The acting was amazing. Nick Offerman and Connie Britton were hilarious and touching. Thomas Mann, Olivia Cooke, and RJ Cyler were also brilliant in every way. The director, Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, did an amazing job here.

18 July 2015,joeravioli,7," Me and Earl shows just how desperately obsessed we are with death
","Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is one of those rare teenage movies that actually depicts teenagers. I never said it does it all that well, but at least it gives it an honest effort. It often feels true to the spirit of youth in that the film is slow, uncertain, ordinary, and slightly crude. The main characters aren't supermodels (although they ain't ugly), and they carry themselves in an exaggerated, basic form of what a teenager truly is. It is a refreshing and hopeful move away from the action-packed and otherwise soulless frameworks of modern teenage films, all the way from ridiculous vampires to ridiculous dystopias.",/review/rw3279435/?ref_=tt_urv
