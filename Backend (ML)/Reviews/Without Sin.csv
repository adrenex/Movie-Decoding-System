11 October 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Definitely worth watching!
","Walker: Independence is actually a pretty darn good show. It's the origin story of the Walker family set in the 1800's. This is not your average CW show so don't stay from it just because it's on that channel. It's a fun show that has a good balance of drama, action and comedy. If you're a fan of the original Walker show or a fan of westerns then give this show a try. Even though this a prequel to the Walker family you don't have to have watched the original to enjoy this. It definitely stands on its own. I'm looking forward to seeing where this story goes. While it's not the best show ever it's still good enough to watch.",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Looking forward to seeing where this goes!
","I've been a fan of the original Walker show with Jared Padalecki so I was really looking forward to this ever since it was first announced. This is the origin story of how the Walker family became what they are now and it takes place in the late 1800's. You don't have to be a fan or even watched the origin Walker to like this, this much more of a western than the original. The characters are written well enough that you actually care about what happens to them and want to see where the story goes. You can tell right from the start that most of these characters aren't what they seem and have a good story to tell. The only problem is there's not enough time yet to truly get to know all these characters but it's just started so there's plenty of time. Glad to see that the ratings were pretty good giving a it a better chance at an early renewal.",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,Sarah423,10," Worth Finding the CW to Watch their New Shows
","The concept is interesting: tell a more complete story of frontier towns in Texas in the 1870's, including marginalized voices who were authentically there.",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,lowsodium_freak,10," Just great!
","This series got off to a great start! Everything is made with extreme care: the sets, the costumes, the direction. Excellent actors, who already make themselves loved, even after such a short first appearance.",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,asteduto,10," Promising start
","I have hoped I would like this new show after seeing the promo. I like Walker and I also Western, so I was hopeful. And they didn't dissapoint.",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2022,oliviacain-30483,10," Surprised
","I am honestly very surprised I liked this. I can quite put into words what makes this show different but I feel as thought the dynamic has changed on how the cw does their pilot shows. I really enjoyed it. The camera work, the acting, even the story line. I hope that this show sticks with it at this pace because I will most assuredly tune in to watch. I mean the plot sounded like every other western but for some reason I was totally into it! I can't wait to see where this show goes! Another thing to note is the music score. Its not the traditional western music/ melody of a western but it has modern elements in it and I really enjoyed that! I hope that this show succeeds because it came out with a bang.",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,kswaters-98639,9," Backdrop beauty
","I'm excited to see a western on the small screen. The time is right. I think people are looking for escapism that isn't totally fantasy. The world is in turmoil with many unknowns and a western takes us back to a time when we thought things were more straight forward. However, they have found a way to expand our antiquated thoughts of the old west and created a much more realistic diverse group of people.",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,imzadimylove,8," Nice to have a new Western series
","I am a big fan of Jared Padalecki, and I will watching advocate for any series he is involved with. I am Overjoyed at the success of Walker, and was happy to hear about this spin-off series. Besides knowing this is set in the past of the Walker family, I deliberately did not seek out any information about this new series.",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,sarahnsw,10," Amazing western
",For real the pilot was so good. I'm hooked already. The whole cast is amazing and the characters are so interesting. Abby is so strong and fierce. For the Walker fans is amazing to get Hoyt back. Matt is doing an excellent job again. Calian is so intense and I can't wait to find out more about him. Kate is so amazing and Kai is adorable. Augusts is very interesting and has some secrets that I can't wait to find out. I never watched a western show like this. Bonus for Mark Sheppard being on it. I always loved his work and I hope he becomes a regular! I can't wait for more. For real everyone just watch it. You all will love it.,/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,danielbadasci,10," FINALLY A SHOW I LOVE!
",This has to be the best CW Show since IZombie first aired no hate but CW TV Shows have been downhill for a while after that. This show had me glue to the screen. What a creative plot and the style of the show works so well with the plot line. The cast is amazing I want to watch more and more. Finally a show that someone can act in and the music is good just absolutely fantastic. Everything is amazing the pacing the writing I'd recommend viewers to watch. It has action twists aleady in the first episode. I am a huge fan. Please CW don't cancel I'm in love I'll be tuning in every Thursday night.,/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,keliosincantare-28177,10," Fantastic job by the cast and crew of Walker: Independence
","I've been looking forward to this show for quite some time, ever since executive producer Jared Padalecki first announced it. As someone who loves and has studied history, I'm aware that much of what gets shown in popular media is highly inaccurate, and one of the things that appealed to me most was Jared, Anna, and Seamus repeated statements that they wanted to give a more accurate and balanced view of the Old West.",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,jules863,9," Amazing start
","What a great start for Walker Independance I loved it. Each character gave us a little look into who they are and I felt invested to find out more about them and what they will bring to the show going forward. The backdrop and costumes are great and reminds me of the old western shows and films. Definitely can't wait to see them all develop as the series goes on especiall Abby, Hoyt, Calian and Augustus . All the cast were great. It was nice seeing another version of Hoyt Rawlins and Matt Barr does it so well. It was nice to see a guest starring role for Mark Shepherd, hope to see him in future episodes. Great start to the series, more please.",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2022,yinya-20697,9," Loved it!
",As a fan of westerns as well as Walker I really enjoyed the show. I think the cast did a good job establishing their characters and look forward to seeing where they go with the story. The use of the different languages was appreciated.,/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,mrsmellautner,10," Can't Wait For MoreðŸ’¯
","All the promo I'd seen had me already somewhat invested in this show, but now that I've seen the pilot I'm 100% hooked! I'm hooked on the plot, the cast of characters, and the town of Independence itself! It's all so well and beautifully done and you can tell everyone in front of and behind the scenes truly cares about the story and being authentic to the diverse history they're portraying. It's a prequel to Walker, about the start of the Walker family legacy, but is more than capable of standing alone. You don't need to be in love with Jared Padalecki's Cordell Walker to fall for the people of Walker Independence. I love it and can't wait for more!",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,Jj-14823,10," Off To A Great Start!
","After the first episode, I really enjoyed it. They took the time to introduce us to all of the important characters. They are being truthful with how diverse it was in the west and it's great to see them using their true languages. I love how they're building the story. The scenery was also so beautiful. I'm very excited to learn all of these character's stories and secrets. It's great to see a strong, intelligent and determined woman as the lead. Hoyt is hilarious and charming, Calian is very strong, smart and intense and I'm sure he and Hoyt are going to have a love/hate relationship and then finding out that Kate is actually a spy at the end! Wow!",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,jfan-76382,9," Walker Independence Pilot
",A great introduction to what looks like an exciting adventure. A wonderful inclusive cast & a peek at the authentic West. Looking forward to see how this story plays out. Great casting. Matt Barr is a joy. The ladies all bring an aspect of mystery. It's wonderful to see different kinds of people not relegated to stereotype.,/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,pe-79420,10," WIndy pilot!
",This new show is so very exciting. Loving all the authenticity they have included and cannot wait to follow the story of these incredible characters and how they are all going to interact as they work to solve the murder of Abby's husband. Hoyt is obviously a character with a lot of depth and a bit of a bad boy but with a good heart. Calian is all heart and torn between his Apache world and his friends. Kate is really a mystery and think her story has some potential twists and turns. Gus I think is trying to decide what is going on and working on the mystery. The new sheriff still appears to be the bad guy but is he? Mark Sheppard as Hagan is a really fun inclusion and look forward to finding out if he is good or bad.,/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2022,burner-99015,10," MUST WATCH! great actors telling a great story
","Wow. I'm super impressed with this. It didn't feel like a pilot. It felt like we were dropped into an already fleshed out world. I felt the same way when I first watched the Walker pilot in 2021. They put together an amazing group of actors in this show to play stellar characters. I couldn't find anything I didn't like about this pilot. Once you watch it, you can't help but think ""why aren't more westerns like this?!"" The diversity and inclusion sets this show apart from any other Western I've seen. The directing was awesome. I think all the producers on Walker and Walker:Independence have found something really special. I hope the changes going on with the CW won't affect either show. Television needs shows like this and it would be a travesty to lose them. I'm so looking forward to watching this show for many years to come.",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,lindseysmithdesign,10," This show is the best!
","I usually don't like CW shows, to be brutally honest. However the production quality of this show is incredible. Seems like a top tier HBO production. The casting was spot-on and refreshing, all unique and wonderful characters. I am already hooked on the story line and love the strong female lead. I will certainly be watching this incredible show develop.",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,alexkadolph,10," Fantastic!!
","Really loving the show so far. I love the diverse ensemble cast. Matt Barr, Justin Johnson Cortez, Philemon Chambers, and Katie Findlay are phenomenal and were born to play their characters. I'm intrigued by Kai and Lucia's characters, but they definitely haven't gotten the screen time that they should have, although I hope it'll come in time. I'm not a huge fan Katherine McNamara; wasn't wowed by her acting in Shadowhunters or Arrow, but I will say that she is definitely much better in this show, although I do think she's the weakest of the cast. I hope the show will run for many more seasons because it is so incredibly put together.",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,deborahcharms,9," An enjoyable return to the genre
","As a longtime fan of westerns, I was a prime candidate for Walker: Independence. It's visually beautiful, from the cinematography, to the costumes, to the cast. You get just enough of a taste of each character in the pilot to make you want to see more of each of their stories, and the chemistry between them all is there right off the bat.",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,tramforo,10," This doesn't feel like a CW show at all!!
","Walker Independence was a pleasant surprise and an immediate favorite for this season's line up of shows. The pilot definitely delivered both on introducing us to the key characters of the series and charming us to Independence itself, leaving the audience hooked for the next episode.",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,rosewater95,10," Setting the Stage for a New Era
","I was excited for this show the moment the premise was announced, and it was well worth the wait. Like many people, I was worried an intriguing idea would be ruined and given the stereotypical CW treatment, but this is no low budget, teenie bopper soap opera. CW under new ownership is starting off with a very promising bang.",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,leiawinter,8," It may not be Deadwood or 1883, but I enjoyed the pilot!
","As a fan of western movies and series, i find the pilot a promising start and am quite excited with this series. It's a mix of western era with modernity (more CW type, include modern music). Initially i didnt think it would work, but ho boy for me it sucked me right in. It may not be everyone's cup of tea if you are a fan of authentic 1800s era western genre. Walker Independence and Walker might be the best series on the CW! It has a diverse cast, and this diversity makes sense! I am also a fan of Jared from Gilmore Girls and Supernatural, which made me more excited for the future of both Walker and Windy.",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,janto-54260,10," Wonderful
","I was never one for Westerns but this one has me hooked. It is so well done, the characters are engaging and there is so much to come. Seriously you need to watch this show for yourself and see how amazing it is, you will not regret it. The show has truly embrace actual diverse casting and you can tell it is not fake wokeness that a lot of shows use the cast and writers really care about these characters and telling their story.",/review/rw8595560/?ref_=tt_urv
