5 April 2020,ciffou,," Pretentious film school project
","I don't undestand why they decided to make a movie adaptation out of the book instead of the controversy surrounding its publication. That would have been far more interesting.
This movie is the poor man's Xavier Dolan film - and even his ""artsy"" shots are obnoxious enough. I assume they expected this movie to be an award winning project: nudity, check; tears, check; redemption arc, check; artsy shots out of nowhere, check. They even throw a couple of scientologists to the mix!
Overall its plot is as basic and predictable as you would expect it to be had it been made during the 90s.",/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2019,muamba_eats_toast,6," Has its moments
",A strong central performance about a film that dances around the edges of the grim reality at times and at times was poorly paced sometimes rushing sections and dragging other parts out. Still does a good job making you care about most the characters unlike some similar films. Unfortunately however it doesn't quite all come together and falls just short of being anything more than reasonably good.,/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv

","Could've been good but nah, they missed the mark.
The lead, was fun to watch but terribly miscast ~ he was playing an addict who as the doctor said was near death with all his vital organs barely working, yet he looked like Fitness instructor.",/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2020,boattop,4," Really wanted to like it
","Movie started great... dark, gritty. But Billy Bob looked uncomfortable with his part as did Giovanni.
The character Lily just seemed thrown in.
If there had been no full frontal male nudity, it seemed like another Made For TV movie. Not good....too bad with such great actors in it.",/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2020,slimecity-38663,5," Its Okaaaay.....
","I wanted to like this, it opens with some pretty nice slomo film work, and looks dark & impressive. I didnt make it to the end however. The characters were a little undercooked and their motivations werent always clear. The romance the lead has didnt seem that convincing. Plus I was really looking forward to seeing Giovanni Ribisi, however he also either had trouble portraying that character, or the writing wasnt right for him. The interactions between him & the lead also seemed forced and these characters seemed to ""get"" close all of a sudden, without real development of how this occurred. Billy Bob did shine in his role however, and (partially) redeemed this film to me. Its not a bad portrayal of drug issues, ie: it doesnt force the ""drugs are bad"" rhetoric down your throat - however there are better films out there dealing with these issues",/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2020,diegosays,7," Boogie Nights 2
","It's funny I'm not seeing any reviews talking about Johnson's Johnson. It seemed like the director wanted to show her husband's pack more than the character's addiction problems.
Aaron Johnson made me feel insecure about my Johnson now. I thought it was fake. It was like watching Boogie Nights (1997) but without the prosthetic fact or a good story.
I enjoyed this film, but I couldn't help having an existencial crisis about sizes after finishing it. Goddamnit that was some kick ass snake.",/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2020,cyer32,8," Brilliant
","I read the book and the follow-up, My Friend Leonard, and when it was revealed that it was mostly made up, I was disappointed but absolutely blown away by Frey's writing and storytelling. That CANNOT be taken away from him. This movie was beautiful. The actors all give their hearts to the story and the direction and cinematography are phenomenal.
For all the people whining about it because Frey wasn't honest about his experiences, well, they must just need something to complain about. I'm guessing all of you just watch documentaries and were irreparably scarred when your parents finally told you Santa isn't real.
I am so very disappointed that I only recently heard that this movie existed. I believe that it was overshadowed by the scandal, but shouldn't have been. Top notch casting, and a pretty long list of familiar faces, again, all of whom did a fantastic job.
All in all, it's a story of triumph and perseverance and progress and growth through some pretty terrible obstacles, even if they are mostly self-imposed.",/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2020,carletonart,1," Not A Recipe For Getting/Staying Sober ******SPOILER ALERT*****
","If the book is like this, know that anyone new to sobriety would not fair well in that rehab. Wrecking the joint, breaking every tenant on getting and staying sober.. Then sticking your nose in a pint of whiskey!?! Grimm has better fairy tales. Thumbs up on the full frontal. The only real piece in the entire film.",/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv

11 June 2020,eoval,5," Tried to like it.
","Frey, under his pen name of Atticus Finch, wrote the I am Number Four series of young adult novels and the movie of the same name. That movie wasn't bad, but did not do good enough to warrant its sequel.",/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2019,iamkeysersoze-13228,9," Surprisingly great
","The film won't be for everyone but I thought it was terrific. It was well handled for the subject matter, brilliantly acted from all especially Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Odessa Young. I really felt something in this film especially when Odessa's character committed suicide. Definitely watch it, it's slow but ultimately pays off.",/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2020,Gordon-11,," An engaging and remarkable struggle
",This tells an a remarkable struggle against substances. His transformation in the rehab is remarkable and pleasing. The number of familiar faces in the film adds to the viewing pleasure as well.,/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2020,df4205,1," All made up...and it shows
","Never read the book, but was aware of the stink it caused when it was revealed that it was all made up. The movie seems equally made up from the get go. I know that movies are fiction and all that...but if they're supposed to take place in our reality...shouldn't they follow the rules of our reality? Even accepting that this took place in the eighties....you cannot just throw an unconscious person on a plane! That's called kidnapping sweetie. And since the predicate act crossed state lines...now its a Federal offence. How did the 'doctor' know where to send him? Who paid for the 'five minutes from now' plane ticket? I'm with the character on this one when the stewardess says she's not allowed to give him a drink. ""Says who?"" That 'Doctor' is not his doctor, he has absolutely zero authority to give you orders in regards to him. And its nice that (presumably) his family has the money to pay for this treatment. Cause let me tell you...treatment facilities ain't cheap! So, I couldn't even make it to the ten minute mark myself. The only thing the film really had going for it was Aaron getting his kit off twice. Other than that, it just seems like one big PSA advert. This movie is your brain on drugs! It's a fictional movie, based on a fictional book, dressed up to seem like a true story.",/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2020,tupkczavvn,4," Complete wasted opportunity.
","The controversy surrounding this once-memoir, now fictional novel would have been exponentially more interesting than just a straight adaptation. Filmmakers, when you cast addicts, perhaps don't cast people who look like CrossFit instructors?",/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2021,Moviedog26,2," Depressing and unrealistic
","A very unrealistic movie. While there is a large waiting list for a free quality rehab center, this movie depicts a utopian world where you get in without a problem, find the girl of your dreams and you have no more than 2 minutes of withdrawal symptoms. Again a slap in the face of the ones that are really suffering. Mila Kunis tried this in Four Good Days and it was a disgrace of a movie.",/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2021,Tammarazzi,10," This hit me hard..don't believe the negative reviews.
","Anyone who gives this movie less than an 8 is obviously an Addict in complete denial, or you have no idea what real addiction is. That's all I have to say.",/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2019,chicagovesuvi,9," I hope the message of this tale helps those who need to hear it.
","Aside from the fabrications and embellishments, the core of this story rings true to someone who has known people who have fought (and continue to fight) for their recovery.",/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2022,brenzbrenz,9," The struggle of addiction is real!
","I thought this was an excellent movie showing the struggles of addiction on all different levels! Those who are addicted who are teachers, those who are addicted who fail, those who are addicted who are strong and those to give up! Unless you struggle with addiction or know someone who has you might not see this movie the same way. I thought it was a great movie!",/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2019,babybuletgani,8," Whatever the truth of Frey's recollections
","Whatever the truth of Frey's recollections, there can be no doubting the power of what the Taylor-Johnsons put on screen. This is a full-blooded portrayal, beginning with Frey at rock bottom as he collapses after a crackfuelled party session. Bundled on a plane by a doctor - destination: a Minnesota rehab facility - he wakes up mid-air, immediately stealing a whisky miniature from the hostess trolley, downing it furiously. Taken to the clinic by his concerned brother (Charlie Hunnam), Frey has no wish to recover and hates the facility's 12-step programme, showing contempt for others there, including the seen-itall counsellor (Juliette Lewis). His antiauthoritarian streak leads him to another troubled soul, former teen prostitute Lilly (Odessa Young), though their secret assignations inevitably lead to more pain.
More volatile than other recent addiction tales (Beautiful Boy, Ben Is Back), this film has a raw energy to it, putting Taylor-Johnson (the director) squarely back on more interesting terrain than her 2015 bonk-buster Fifty Shades Of Grey. Featuring fine work from Billy Bob Thornton as a flamboyant addict prone to dispensing pearls of wisdom, and an electric ATJ at his most grizzled, this is the sort of film where you just can't say no.",/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2021,coreytegley,7," A great little movie with some real life stuff
",This was really a great movie about real life addiction and rehab and life. I was very surprised in the story. The min character I did not know but he was great. Everyone else in the movie I knew and they were outstanding. Billy Bob was great Juliette Lewis was was great. The whole cast was good. A must see drama.,/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2020,SantaCruzReviews,4," Contrived and Implausible
","Cartoonish and unlikable characters who were poorly acted. Worst depiction of chemical dependency treatment. If the movie accurately depicts the book, it's a wonder how anyone believed it and was shocked when it was revealed that he made a lot of it up.",/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2022,aarpcats,4," Lies on lies on lies.
",The film tells the story about a young man's struggle with addiction. It is based on the biography by the same name that was so popular that Oprah had the author on her show. The book sold millions of copies and thrilled millions of readers.,/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2019,setbro,1," Surprised this was even made considering its all made up
","So for those who don't know, this was one of Oprah's first book of the month. And this was when a little no name book could become a million seller. So the author sold this book to be a true story which it is not. Those of you old enough to remember well recall Oprah bringing the author James Frey back to the Oprah show and gave him a classic tongue lashing. It was epic oh, she made him cry on National Television.",/review/rw5311048/?ref_=tt_urv
