9 August 2014,gogoschka-1,," The most visual – and visually daring – crime show on TV
","Having seen the films based on Thomas Harris' novels, I couldn't for the life of me imagine an actor other than Anthony Hopkins for the role of Hannibal Lecter (although I had seen - and liked - Brian Cox' take on the character in Michael Mann's 'Manhunter' which was released before 'The Silence of the Lambs'). Apart from that, I didn't see the point in retelling a story that had already been told very well on film – and with outstanding actors. For those reasons, I deprived myself of the pleasure of watching 'Hannibal' until the second season of the show started - but boy: am I glad I finally got over myself and did start!

","After I started this series, my mouth was open, it was very good. I was amazed, the acting, the script, everything was perfect.",/review/rw2796443/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2020,rlranallo,10," Mads and Hugh - impeccable for these roles WOW
","Mads and Hugh are perfect for the roles they capture in this series. They balance that fine line of love and disgust and adoration for one another - it's so beautifully done
I just wish this would of continued on after season 3
Definitely not for the weak hearted in regards to gore",/review/rw2796443/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2015,planktonrules,9," Excellent but NOT for every taste...
","I am going to say something heretical, so hold on to your seats. I thought that the Hannibal Lecter character in the movie ""Silence of the Lambs"" was extremely overrated. Subtle, he was NOT, that's for sure. Because of this, I really, really like the new incarnation of the doctor in this Bryan Fuller series. He is sophisticated, clever and, most importantly, a credible villain--not some bizarro dude going on about chianti and fava beans! In fact, the sophistication and style of this show is why I think it's a winner.",/review/rw2796443/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2020,petemcphee2,10," Possibly the best written crime/horror ever
","Many will argue that Hopkins is ""the best and only"" Hannibal, much like folk declare allegiance to Bond actors.
But I like to think of each incarnation as seperate and of its time.
There's no doubting that Hugh Dancy's Will Graham is streets ahead of Ed Norton's earlier portayal.
Hannibal is easily my favourite Lector telling.
It benefits from two things;
The depth of field afforded the story by being a TV series and the ability to tap and reference the rich tapestry of what's went before.
Hannibal the TV series is exceptional, a prequel that feeds directly into a narrative that feels fresh and yet familiar.
Because of the intricacies of the known characters it plays out like a chess game.
Intelligence is sexy, murder is horrifying... Sexy horrifying is so alluring as an entertainment form.
The visual effects of this are mind blowing. I've never seen horror be filmed as artistically as this outside of Penny Dreadful.
For 3 seasons this show thrilled and entertained. Now we are anticipating a 4th season to emerge from the gloom of Covid-19.
Let's hope its writers have learned everything the original 3 seasons took in from the previous incarnations.
Let's hope we remain horrified, mesmerised and even rooting for the biggest and baddest anti hero of Modern Horror.",/review/rw2796443/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2020,ichsachmalso,9," So aesthetically pleasing
","I've been a fan of the franchise long before the show came into being, and it did not disappoint! I love how beautiful everything is shot despite all of the horror and gore. The motives and emotions are intricate and the acting is a thing to behold.
Yeah, the third season could use a bit more plot to buff out the poetry but really, I can't fault it much. This is also one of the very few shows that has had a satisfactory ending!",/review/rw2796443/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2020,UniqueParticle,10," Masterful crime/horror show
","Visually arresting to watch especially with the soothing music and incredible acting! Hugh Dancy is electrifying, I love the way he solves crime scenes and the fact he seems to have Asperger's which I have too. The nightmares are spellbinding and visual effects are one of my favorite things ever done! Hannibal is written with brilliance throughout; I'm so hooked to this charming elegant show.",/review/rw2796443/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2020,ryanwinning1,10," Blows CSI away!
","Before watching this series I wondered ""Why in the world would they try to recreate the Hannibal movie series? It's been done! It's over! No one can replace Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal!!"" Boy was I wrong. Mads Mikkelsen shows off some seriously unique acting chops throughout this entire series! I absolutely hated him in the Bond film Casino Royale(In a good way!) I hated him because he was so twisted, evil, smart and cunning as the villain and all those traits are magnified throughout the 39 episodes of this series. It's gruesome and horrifically violent and even though I was cringing because it seems so realistic I was simultaneously wildly-entertained all the while! There simply isn't enough time to tell the full Hannibal story over 3 movies and appreciate all the details so I realize now this 3 season series is entirely justified. As someone who's suffered with ADHD for most of my life I also appreciate the mental health aspect behind this series. with the time of a TV series you get a chance to go under the hood of Hannibal the psychiatrist and in a 2-hour hollywood movie there just isn't enough time to dig deep into mental health in what separates Special FBI agents, serial killers or average ordinary people. I found the whole series thought provoking and very interesting.",/review/rw2796443/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2020,BladeSparkles,10," Magnificent
","Truly superb writing, casting, acting, direction and editing. This show is a work of art. If you can, please watch in a quiet, intimate setting to truly appreciate the elegant horror being served. I have never been as impressed with a series as I am with this one. It's very surprising that a show this dark was on network television, I can't see the NBC viewer appreciating such darkness. I'm preparing for a second viewing of all the seasons. It was perfection to the very end.",/review/rw2796443/?ref_=tt_urv

1 September 2015,Manal1987,8," A Feast for the Eye and Soul Not the Mind
","The number of I-hate-you-then-I-love-you moments I have had during watching NBC's Hannibal since it started in 2013 until it sadly (for us viewers) ended last Saturday is too great to count. However, the disappointment I am feeling right now because I will see no more of Hannibal is a success in and of itself. At first I did not know how to go about this review in the most logical way possible (it is really hard to convince my mind to do so!) so I came up with the 'ingenious' idea of putting my remarks into points as randomly as they jump to my head:",/review/rw2796443/?ref_=tt_urv

I will not talk long, it is an exceptional series that requires some episodes until you get it strong and if you get it it will be one of your favorites.

1 July 2016,eapplebaum,10," Visual Masterpiece and Gruesome yet compelling story
","This show was a masterpiece in that it was a visual visual art form with quite unexpected writing and plot twists. The acting was superb and the story was extremely disturbing and sophisticated. Opinions are just that, opinions; and if one looks at the content of this series and bases their opinion of the execution of story and production value on the fact that a reviewer hates gruesome violence and serial killers, they're not going to ""get"" this show, at all. Everything about this series should be viewed as an art form and at the same time commentary of our Society. it's quite profound and deep. To understand the genius of this series better one must read the brilliant review of the series by Emily Nussbaum in The New Yorker.",/review/rw2796443/?ref_=tt_urv

7 August 2013,InternetOfZings,10," Creepy, unsettling and beautiful
","Boy am I glad that I stumbled onto this series. I was pretty bored with all of the current TV shows which I've been watching (well, that's really only Dexter and True Blood at the moment) or they've been on break. Hannibal hooked me right from the first episode and after seeing the whole season I'd say it's right up there among my favorite TV shows. ",/review/rw2796443/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2014,zactac,10," A macabre world filled with intelligent twists.
","I have to say I am very impressed with how the spin-off series of Hannibal Lector has turned out. While I was a little worried at first after hearing the idea to create a series based on the most famous cannibal in the history of film, the series have placed my fears to rest.",/review/rw2796443/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2020,getuliohf,10," Intense, suberb and very dark
","This show is quite good and very intense. It's one of most disturbing stories I ever watched. It shows how far a disturbed but genious and dark mind can go. Weak people should not watch it, I think, because many fears can be triggered when seeing some situations depicted in the episodes, and could be even traumatic.",/review/rw2796443/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2013,akaichou-crimsonbutterfl,9," Psychological thriller at its finest.
","If you're wondering, this drama does not follow the story line of the previous Hannibal film franchise. However, it does not mean that the series doesn't pack its own punch in terms of tension and suspense. (I'm in such awe, I feel inadequate trying to leave a review for this show. I won't reveal any more than what is available on the wikipedia page.)",/review/rw2796443/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2014,joleree,10," So good that I fear for it not getting renewed
","We have come through the last couple of years with some excellent TV programming. dialog, writing, directing, acting some of the episodes if not entire seasons trashing anything that was showing at the local megaplex. Just like most here I was highly skeptical at the idea of a made for TV Hannibal, as Robert Downey is to Iron Man and Hugh Jackman is to Wolverine.......for me Anthony Hopkins was to Hannibal Lecter. Well no more. When telling people about this show, that's what I use as an approach. When you think of Hannibal Lecter you tend to think of Anthony Hopkins. Well not anymore, what a tribute to Mads Mikkelsen that he could take this amazing pop culture character and and so firmly attach his name to it. If you have been skeptical or just not ""seeing"" you're doing yourself a great disservice in not checking this out. I absolutely LOATHE that comcast now charges for past seasons of network shows, but this is the only one that I would ever say is worth purchasing and viewing before season 3 gets here. Hannibal is excellent television.",/review/rw2796443/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2013,fathersonholygore,10," Another beautifully rendered portrait of Hannibal and Will Graham
","Mads Mikkelsen has been a favourite of mine since I first saw Pusher and it's sequel Pusher II: With Blood On My Hands (directed by Nicolas Winding Refn), so when I originally heard he'd be portraying Hannibal Lecter in this new series, I was absolutely in my glee. He inhabits Hannibal quite easily it seems; even watching him eat dinner with colleagues, drinking wine, you can see a man who is a connoisseur of fine food and drink; when Hannibal perceives rudeness, Mads' charismatic face shows the ever-so-slight murderer beneath the human veil. Lecter comes off with the intelligence Anythony Hopkins brought to the role, but Mikkelsen somehow manages to make the character colder, more distant, yet with the same frightening disposition of his predecessor; perhaps it has much to do with seeing Hannibal long before being incarcerated, as opposed to Hopkins' Lecter who was always either in prison, or on the run for his screen time (except for the brief few scenes at the beginning of Red Dragon with Graham and Lecter discussing theories). Regardless, this portrayal of Hannibal is absolutely amazing, and Mads' little nuances he brings to the character fit perfectly. One particular instance I love is when he is reading Freddie Lounds' report about the Ripper already being in a mental hospital (a guest starring role for the brilliant Eddie Izzard), and Hannibal calmly starts flicking his fingers, showing a slow crack in the outer mask he wears; you can see his anger towards someone else taking credit for his crimes, and you can almost see the coming storm it will induce.",/review/rw2796443/?ref_=tt_urv
