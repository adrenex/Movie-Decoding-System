12 March 2011,planktonrules,9," I can't believe the work that Natalie Portman put into this film and it's easy to see why she received the Oscar.
","By now, Natalie Portman has already won the Oscar for Best Actress for this film. And, because my oldest daughter adored this film and strongly recommended I see it (WITHOUT her due to the content of the film!), I decide to see it and am glad that I did. Natalie Portman's commitment to this film is incredible. Seeing the weight that she lost, the ballet moves she worked on and the wonderful acting, it's very obvious why she got the award.",/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2014,SnoopyStyle,8," Amazing Natalie Portman performance
","Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a New York City ballerina living with her overbearing mother (Barbara Hershey). The prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) is being replaced for the opening production of Swan Lake. Nina is the favorite, but new dancer Lily (Mila Kunis) is impressive as well. Nina fits the role of the beautiful, fearful, fragile White Swan perfectly, but she can't get the Black Swan role right unlike Lily. She's obsessed with her deteriorating body as her paranoid mind collapses.",/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2019,Hitchcoc,9," Painful to Watch
","This is one of those films best seen only once. It hones in on the fragility of an artist and lays open wounds that are hard to witness. Natalie Portman's character is driven but vulnerable and s set up to succumb to her art. Of course, rivalry is a given, and her rival does everything she can to put the screws to her. Unfortunately, the questioning of her own talent is going to show at some point. I can't say I enjoyed this movie. I realize that obsession is often a strength with artists, but it can also be all consuming. This film is about as dark as it can be but it puts a stranglehold on the viewers.",/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2010,DonFishies,10," A beautiful and nightmarish masterpiece
","There are not enough words in the English language to describe the praise Darren Aronofsky deserves for Black Swan. It was one of the most talked about and sought after films at this year's Toronto International Film Festival (which I managed to snag a ticket for), and for good reason – it is a masterpiece that is just as much beautiful as it is nightmarish.",/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2010,colinrgeorge,9," A Swan Dive into Darkness
","Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"" makes ballet cool—and if that isn't a Herculean feat in itself, I don't know what is. It also happens to be one of the best films of the year, featuring one of the best performances of the year. Natalie Portman will be nominated for her devastating portrayal of petite perfectionist Nina the ballerina or I'll pull a Werner Herzog and eat my shoe.",/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2010,moviemanMA,9," The price of perfection
","Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan is an examination of obsession. Obsession for beauty, fame, and above all, perfection. We are shown glimpses of its splendor, only to be consumed by the ugliness and harsh reality that is the world of professional ballet.",/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2011,bob the moo,," Engaging psychological horror despite not being as ""high-brow"" as the ballet frame suggests
","Esteemed IMDb writer Theo Robertson messaged me the other day about this film and, while I skimmed it for fear of having him influence me in terms of his opinion, I did read that several older people had walked out of this film, seemingly having expected some sort of high-brow film with its roots in ballet. One can understand why because with all the award buzz and the superficial subject matter (ballet) combined with the actress and of course the previous work of the director, this must surely be an intelligent piece to be ""appreciated"" and ""considered"". What one wouldn't expect would be a film that, with a bit more gore, could easily be just another trashy horror/thriller that is released on video and has plenty of sex, violence and jump scares to it.",/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv

",First off let no one think that if they see Black Swan from 2010 that earned Natalie Portman a Best Actress Oscar that they are looking at a remake of the Tyrone Power swashbuckling classic. Instead this film which has a setting in a ballet company is an interesting combination of plot themes from A Double Life and All About Eve.,/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv

13 April 2011,TheLittleSongbird,9," Beautiful, tragic, haunting and nightmarish
","I personally do not think this movie the best movie of 2010, I did prefer The King's Speech and The Social Network. But overall, Black Swan is a very, very good film.",/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2010,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," Incredibly sad, beautiful, tragic and brilliant
","Perfection is a state of completeness and flawlessness. How many of you have known a perfectionist or you yourself feel the need to be perfect at all times? To the point where it almost drives you or the person insane? But to be honest, I think we've all had those moments of wanting to be perfect. Praised as one of the best films of the year, Darren Aronofsky takes us into the psyche of another character, I would say that this is my favorite film by him. At a young age he has come so far in creating some of cinema's most fascinating characters and stories, he's given us such amazing films. His vision brings out one of the year's best films and one of my new favorites, he and Natalie Portman were meant to work together. I absolutely adore Natalie Portman, but I have been waiting for her to have a role as challenging as Black Swan, her intelligence, grace, beauty and talent shine and I hope she is not only nominated but wins the Oscar for this film. The supporting cast is incredible as well, Mila Kunis, I am just falling in love with her. Proving more and more that she's not just a pretty face but can take on a role that can be dangerous and makes it her own and makes it relatable to the audience. Vincent Cassel is becoming one of my favorite actors, he's so strong and passionate and clearly gave so much into this role as the seductive dance teacher who in a sense is his dancer's prince from Swan Lake.",/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2010,KnightsofNi11,9," A seductive masterpiece
","Darren Aronofsky proves once again that he is an absolute genius in the modern world of cinema and he can work in any genre and make it look beautiful, real, visceral, and always keeping with his specific visual style, proving himself to be an absolute auteur. Black Swan is Aronofsky's fifth feature film, and it shows how his directing ability is somehow getting better. The movie is about a ballet dancer, Nina (Natalie Portman), who is dealing with the pressures of playing The Swan Queen in her companies production of Swan Lake. The pressures brought about by this demanding role cause her to begin to slowly crack under pressure, especially when she has to worry about a rival dancer possibly taking her spot. My synopsis doesn't do the film any justice though, and the result of this story is a disturbing and breath taking thriller that combines beauty with visceral intensity, and keeps you on the edge of your seat and your eyes glued to the screen.",/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2011,tnrcooper,5," High minded schlock
","This film would have you believe that it is a high-minded meditation on art, the ego, and mental illness. However, if you polish a turd, it's still a turd. Same goes for this movie. It might look nice and deal with some important topics and seem quite serious, but to me, this was high-minded schlock.",/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2011,Radu_A,1," If you love your ballet - stay away!
","When a movie is being hyped to a substantial degree, there is always a risk that this is not exactly due to its merit, but rather part of an aggressive marketing campaign. Rarely has such a phenomena been so obvious as prior to the release of 'Black Swan': the media have been up and running about Portman's real-life romance sparked during its filming, plus pondering the chances of 'Black Swan' establishing ballet as a fashion trend. Still, having been partnered with a dancer for a number of years, I couldn't resist the temptation - as a result of which I have to side with those reviewers here who regard it as an utterly pointless affair.",/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2011,Doylenf,7," Unstable ballerina loses grip on reality and becomes The Black Swan...
","It's easy to see that Darren Aronofsky was influenced by the classic THE RED SHOES ('48), except that the '48 film did not telegraph its tragic ending which came as somewhat of an abrupt surprise. On the other hand, BLACK SWAN telegraphs its outcome from Scene One, the major fault of the film which ends on an extremely downbeat note.",/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2012,jacklmauro,1," Horse Feathers
","The worst thing about the very bad 'Swan' is that, somehow, people think it's a brilliant film. The best thing is that it makes you wish somebody would really center a great film in the fascinating world of ballet. This...ain't it. I read this script was developed over ten years. Really? Ten years in which to create a cartoon, horny, bombastic company director, spouting clichés about 'passion' and 'letting go'? Ten years, and no one notices that Nina has no character at all? Ten years, and it seemed plausible that a blatantly frightened, whiny dancer should get the lead in 'Swan Lake'? Quite honestly, I kept waiting for this film to actually begin; only when the absurd death-drive ending was tacked on did I realize it was over. Utterly bad, all the way, and mostly because we get no sense of Portman's identity WHATSOEVER. More exactly, there is no foundation upon which to build either the dark side's emergence from her, OR her horror of it. Other reviews here rightly point out the idiocies, as in a star ballerina being 'fired' and in drunken shock over it, or an alternate lead selected so late in the game, or a director engaging in conduct that would get any artistic director out on his ass in a heartbeat, no matter the artsy milieu. All of that would have been bearable, had there been any notion even hinted at of what and who Nina is. Nothing. So weird stuff happens to this non-character, there's a ridiculously gratuitous lesbian fantasy, you early on don't freak over the blood because, after five minutes, you know it's in her head, and then she achieves perfection in death. And you don't care at all. PS How bad? I kept longing to see Barbra Streisand take the stage in a tutu, saying, 'You vanna kill a swvan? Dese lovelies?'",/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2011,mikelepost,5," Mediocre and immature
","Based on the commercials for Black Swan, I walked into the theater expecting to see a film about a career ballerina who is forced to access her repressed dark side in preparation for her role as the swan queen and cracks under the pressure. Instead, the film I saw was about a meek young woman who's possibly schizophrenic and certainly on the verge of a nervous breakdown from the opening reel. There's no real drama because Nina is already broken. All that's left is for the viewer is to watch her become increasingly unhinged.",/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2017,Bored_Dragon,6," Overrated
","Natalie did deserve her Oscar, but the movie overall is extremely boring. The first hour is agonizing, and then, after some 65 minutes, something finally begins to happen and the finale is great. But I was at the edge of giving up ten times and missing that good ending, because it takes real effort to go through the first hour.",/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2014,denis888,1," Awful Mess
","I hated every single minute of this torturous endless take on ballet, gossips, hate, split personality, scheming,sexual innuendos,dull music, vague plot, predictable twists, extremely bad choice of color scheme and very silly ending. Well, that seems to be a sum of all evil in that Aronofsky's horrible movie, that is very slow, pathetic, never engaging, never thrilling and never convincing. It does not persuade to go and watch ballet, or try to perceive Swan Lake better. Nay, in fact, thyme filmmakers killed any hint of interest to this. This boggy plodding mess is not a decent take on mental disease, either. It does not provide any deep picture or awake any sympathy to any of the heroes. In fact, it is so cold, detached, distanced and bleak that all the possible attempt to like ballet will die immediately. Waste of time, and all the parts are very weak too - neither Portman, nor Kassel, Ryder, Kunis or else did anything to get us involved. It is so vapid and dry that next idea would be to get and watch some light-weight comedy or something",/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2011,Theo Robertson,7," Well Directed But Let Down By Frustrating Story Telling
",Black swan by Darran Aronofsky continues the director's body that will split audiences and critics to two extreme camps . . Certainly those who thought REQUIEM FOR A DREAM was an unsung masterpiece will probably have a higher opinion of it since SWAN shows Aronofsky's influences that are as diverse as Cronenberg's work from the 1970s and German expressionist cinema ,/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2011,dusan-22,1," Pop Corn and Art
","This movie reminds me on how one average American imagines art. Probably the same way that the whale imagines how is it to fly as an eagle. This movie is a cheap insult for Chaikovsky. Pulling up the standard prosaic and narrow film ideas to imply art, Hollywood brings this time one more dull and unimaginative film work. Black Swan has no film pattern at all. No film rhythm. No film plot. And no art sparkles at all. It is the same tense in the beginning as at the end. Or is the life of pro ballet player with difficulties she is facing a film plot just because Chaikovsky is involved? Poor Chaikovsky could not melt in this tele novela mish-mash of sex and twist, love and hate. Did I say that this is definitely the worst movie of Vincent Cassel? And above all Mr director, even if you latently tried to film the Swan Lake you should be aware of the fact that film and ballet are two different art categories. Did you say 8.6 grade??? I am definitely leaving IMDb. Do svidaniya!",/review/rw2330678/?ref_=tt_urv
