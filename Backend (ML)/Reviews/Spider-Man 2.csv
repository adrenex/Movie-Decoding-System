24 October 2017,planktonrules,10," Well worth seeing just to watch Oldman's performance.
","At this point, ""Darkest Hour"" has an overall rating of 5.3. I do not understand this at all, but the film has not actually been released yet and has only been seen in film festivals. I assume the overall score will increase considerably--especially since the two reviews for it were quite positive.",/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2017,RNMorton,10," Outstanding even with some minor flaws
","I cannot remember the last time I was in a movie and I said, gee I wish this movie would keep going because it's just so damn good. I don't really have to say anything more about Oldman beyond what's already been said, that was brilliant Academy Award work. Despite being a literalist on history and not enjoying Hollywood embellishments/contrivances that didn't really happen, I will repeat something I said on another movie (Patton): I am okay where a fictional event is one that could have happened (or maybe happened out of time sequence) where it is used more to show the persona of the character than to establish an historical fact. Notwithstanding this, the subway scene may have been a little much. Strong cast throughout, including the portrayers of King George VI, Chamberlain, Halifax and Churchill's lovely secretary (James). A must see for WW II buffs and appreciators of good cinema everywhere.",/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2020,SamPamBam,8," Oldman Shines
","Although its been shown to have been largely fictionalized, the gist of the story is accurate. Oldman gives an incredible performance, and not as some old bellowing windbag either.
After seeing this, one might recommend reading churchill's own 6 volume set on the subject, but to save time, the first volume, The Gathering Storm, may provide one with some historical pretext for this monumental event in western history-Churchill standing up to a madman, and this saving not just britain, but all good men everywhere.
Oldman, you da man!",/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2018,AlsExGal,9," I never tire of watching this!
","This biopic of a very narrow period in Winston Churchill's life - May 1940 to be exact - was probably made to earn British actor Gary Oldman the academy award, but man, did he ever earn it! This film won Oscars for Best Actor for Oldman and for makeup, and I'd say they definitely earned that. Great trouble is taken to make sure you believe you are looking right at Sir Winston. Oldman literally disappears into the part.",/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2018,ferdinand1932,6," Almost history
","As a film this is quite good; it's not dull, the performances are good, the production design is excellent, the script is a professional piece of work and even Oldman's make-up is not too distracting. ",/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv

6 April 2020,ethanbresnett,9," Gary Oldman at his best!
",Darkest Hour shines a light on a crucial moment in British and world history - the initial month of Churchill's term as he stand resolutely in the face of Hitler's advance while his peers wish to sue for peace.,/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2017,themadmovieman,9," Historically fascinating, but most importantly filled with exhilarating energy, humour and passion throughout
","Not only is this a riveting account of one of the most important moments of the Second World War, but it's also an exhilarating drama that goes beyond being a simple biography by bringing humour, energy and passion to every moment. With a stunning central performance by Gary Oldman, confident and passionate directing from Joe Wright, and a brilliant screenplay from start to finish, Darkest Hour is a simply exceptional film.",/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv

10 February 2018,MOscarbradley,5," Oldman's great; pity about the film.
","When Meryl Streep won her third Oscar for playing Margaret Thatcher in ""The Iron Lady"" it was as much for her make-up as it was for her acting, (it's actually one of her least interesting performances; more mimicry than anything else). The same can't be said of Gary Oldman's turn as Winston Churchill in Joe Wright's ""Darkest Hour"". It's a phenomenal performance that demolishes all previous Churchills. Yes, he looks the part thanks again to his hugely talented make-up artists and he has the voice off pat, but more importantly he gets inside Churchill's heart and head which is, perhaps, something of a surprise considering the material he's been given to work with is really rather third-rate.",/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2017,normando40,8," Another Gary Oldman Triumph
","It's a one man show about one of the towering figures of the 20th Century and what a show it is. Gary Oldman has been able to be Sid Vicious in ""Sid And Nancy"" with the same outstanding commitment and extraordinary results. Joe Wright, the gifted director of ""Atonement"" presents us with an irresistible version of Churchill through the magic powers of Oldman but sometimes he doesn't seem to trust the power of what he has in his hand. Eccentric cuts in the middle of a famous speech for instance and other stylistic distractions arrive with irritating frequency but that doesn't spoil. too much, the joy and fun of seeing Gary Olman in action. Also interesting to notice, Dunkirk provides a very moving moment for the second time this year.",/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2020,paul2001sw-1,5," Reducing history to generic myth
","With hindsight, it was absolutely a good thing that Britain was led by the unlikely figure of Winston Churchill during World War Two. The politics around Churchill's ascension to power are very interesting, from the desperate desire of many to avoid war at all costs, to the major role of Churchill's own incompetence during the Norway campaign in the fall of Chamberlain's government. There's lots of good material for a film here, but unfortunately 'Darkest Hour' isn't that movie, preferring to exaggerate both Churchill's heroism and buffoonishness, while painting his political opponents as virtual traitors to the country. Meanwhile, the dramatization of the story reduces it to the banal narrative of a Hollywood biopic, with the premier granted an unlikely epiphany on the London Underground. Gary Oldman buries himself in the character, but it's in the service of myth more then history.",/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2018,claudio_carvalho,8," Fantastic Performance
","It is impressive how The World War II can still produce great films after almost eighty year. ""Darkest Hour"" is an example, showing the biography of Winston Churchill in 1940 when Hitler was invading and dominating the Western Europe. But the film works mainly because of the fantastic performance of Gary Oldman. It is amazing how this actor incorporates the image we have of the great British leader in archival footages. Gary Oldman really deserves the Oscar! Kristin Scott Thomas is also impressive in the role of Churchill's beloved wife Clemmie. My vote is eight.",/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2019,Hitchcoc,7," Well Acted but Historically Contrived
","Winston Churchill is one of history's most enigmatic figures. As Great Britain watches Europe fall to the Nazis, most of the leaders sit, hands in their pockets, trying to figure out what to do. Neville Chamberlain has sold the country out, thinking he has become buddies with Hitler. Of course, the scourge of history would simply see that as avoiding an obstruction. So the call on gnarly old Winston, whose reputation in other confrontations is not that good (according to this film). So we are going to see a biographical presentation of this great man. What we get is a guy that can't go twenty minutes without downing four fingers of whiskey or smoking a dozen cigars a day. He is doddering and forgetful. That's OK. Maybe that was him. I suspect not quite as severe. While this movie portrays the time pretty accurately, they repeatedly stick him in situations where he can deliver pithy comments. A secretary, the young woman who portrayed Rose on Downton Abby, is his confidante. There is a scene on the subway. Did any of this ever take place. I know it is historical ""fiction,"" but we deserve a bit more. It's not a terrible movie, hence my rating, but don't write a book report using the events presented here.",/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2018,ozjosh03,4," A pile of old tosh
","I've grudgingly allotted four stars for three of the leading performances. Gary Oldman certainly pulls out all the stops to deliver a performance that is convincing, colourful and entirely unsurprising. Yet he's also acted off the screen by Ben Mendelsohn every time Winston meets King George, for Mendelsohn gives a performance that is more under-stated, more human and less obviously manipulative. Oldman is also out-charisma'd whenever Kristin Scott Thomas glides into view as Clemmie. So for all its earnest Oscar-worthiness, Oldman's performance isn't even the best in the film. Acting aside, there is almost nothing to recommend Darkest Hour. It's burdened with clumsy plot exposition that sounds precisely like it's been cut and pasted from a history book. It's undercut by cheap, unconvincing special effects. And, most remarkably of all - even if you've somehow been sucked in by the amateur dramatics - it has one spectacularly ill-judged scene that instantly sinks the entire enterprise. You won't have any trouble spotting which scene I mean. You'll probably be laughing out loud or reaching for something to hurl at the screen. It's when poor anguished Winston takes the advice of the King and determines to ask the British people what to do. So he heads for the London Underground and - travelling just one stop east on the District Line! - chats with a cross-section of plucky Brits who all urge him to fight on. It couldn't be more ridiculous if one said ""fight them on the beaches"", the next said ""fight them on the landing fields"" , and the next ""fight them in the fields"". It actually couldn't be more ridiculous if they all then simultaneously broke into a song titled ""We Shall Never Surrender"" and Winston danced merrily with a couple of pearly kings and queens. It's a scene so mind-bogglingly awful that any respect you might have had for the film drains completely away and you spend the rest of the running time pondering just how something so awful was ever contemplated, much less actually staged and shot.",/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2018,TheLittleSongbird,8," Far from film's darkest hour, and Oldman's finest hour
","Have a real fondness for biopics, regardless of the treatment of history and their subjects for some. Consider Winston Churchill one of the most interesting and extraordinary 20th century, and history in general, figures and Gary Oldman one of the best actors working today that in recent years deserved more roles more worthy of his talents. The rest of the cast are also talented and while Joe Wright is hit and miss for me a few of his films are good to outstanding. ",/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2018,blanche-2,8," a dark time in history
","Passionate, rousing film about the dark days of May 1940, when Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) became prime minister and resisted the idea of peace negotiations with Germany.",/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2018,magnuslhad,3," shallow myth-making
","There is a lightness of touch to Joe Wright, a frivolity, that invades the tone of this film and sets it off-kilter. Any biopic takes on the challenge of creating drama and tension from events we may already be familiar with. This is perhaps more pronounced when it comes to such a titanic historical figure as Churchill. The film rightly invests its time in showing just how fraught the political struggle Churchill faced to fight rather than negotiate was. Unfortunately, Darkest Hour lacks complexity in its portrayal. Churchill shouts at a secretary, who becomes a cheer-leading personal assistant. His wife is similarly one note, admonishing him while managing to steadfastly encourage him at the same time. Halifax and Chamberlain are reduced to vaudeville villainy, while the king is a pompous buffoon. There are some clunky set pieces, most notably a cringe-worthy outing by Churchill on a Tube train to engage with the good folk of Britain. These include a black man, the only black man on the train, and possibly in the whole film, and the most earnest child in the history of Albion. Stalinist propaganda filmmakers would blush at such tokenism. Oldman opts for acting as impersonation rather than interpretation. It's a convincing impersonation, but still mimicry rather than artistry. Wright's depiction of Dunkirk in 'Atonement' had the showmanship of the circus ring, and has been devalued by Nolan's recent more authentic portrayal. Churchill's darkest hour will no doubt be re-visited and re-evaluated in the future when a filmmaker more in tune with the material takes it on.",/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2020,guisreis,8," A movie on the politics of II World War on the British side
","I loved the camera movements (dolly and slow motion trucks), cinematography is beautiful, and special effects are used in the right way. Gary Oldman's performance in the hard tile of Winston Churchill is perfect. There are some very good dialogs (the one between Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt is possibly the best), but, despite I did like the fantasy moment in the underground/subway, his chat with black Marcus Peter is perhaps exaggeratedly unreal. The mood and dynamics inside House of Commons is a cinematic delight for all people interested in party politics. Churchill's relationships with his wife, his secretary and king George are also interesting. A good movie worth watching.",/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2018,davidink,2," I feel cheated
","I really enjoyed the movie and am a big Oldman fan. But got sad and even angry when I read about how every event that cought your attention is not true. Never took place. Pure fiction. Like the train ride, or the verbal battles about peace negotiations, or who initiated Operation Dynamo, or peoples reactions to his speeches. ",/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2019,Prabhuraj,8," Fantastic movie - really worth watching. Oldman deserved the Oscar
","Clearly Oldman is the star of this film, fully convincing in his turn as Winston Churchill. The dialogue is amazing and the flow great as we see a charismatic Churchill who as harsh as he may seem, truly cared for his country. Hearing that the subway scene wasn't true did inevitably diminish its greatness for me, but that horrible ending! Out of nowhere! Left the movie on such a weird note.",/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv

22 December 2017,llareggub,9," Oldman's Triumph
","Garry Oldman first came to my notice as Sid. He now steps into Albert Finney's gigantic shoes, and does not disappoint. But a note of disapproval- it was not the Labour Party which brought down Chamberlain in 1940, it was Leo Amery, single handed, with the greatest, most passionate Cri de Coeur ever heard in a parliament until the Man himself unleashed the 18"" guns of the English Language.
 P.S. I should have mentioned Sir Roger Keyes turning up to the debate in Full Dress. A bit of Drang for Amery's Sturm. But it was Chamberlain's own party that delivered the Coup de Gras: Greenwood just sank the boot into the corpse.",/review/rw3859060/?ref_=tt_urv
