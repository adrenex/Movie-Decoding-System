24 March 2022,grantss,7," Brilliant start but the shine goes off by Season 2 and by Season 3 it's annoyingly stale and repetitive

21 February 2022,supermellowcali,4," Exhausted itself
","I thought this was a good story and a fun show in season 1. Maybe it just ran its course but the season 4 episode I just watched was tedious and not funny. Maybe if her jokes were better? The scenes were interesting at first, and shocking the audience was fun but, after that wears off, it's not very interesting.",/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2018,redmondgarmony,10," Bring on Season 3 PLEASE!!!
","Superb writing, comic geniuses are definitely on board. The sight gags in Series 2 (eg Susie's plunger and camp stalker, the telethon) are especially priceless. Arguably the funniest and most philosophical show, well balanced with drama, I've ever seen. The setting, wardrobe, music and production is impeccable and elevates this above anything in decades.",/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2017,penniweninger,10," Crisp, fresh, hilarious
","We've recently retired and are enjoying a lot of television time. The good news is there is a lot of TV available. The bad news is that it can't possibly all be good. At some point as you flick through the options, you can't help but laugh at the absurdity of some of these shows. I get the challenge to producers and artists to fill hundreds of channels, 24/7, I really do. I've learned to seriously adjust my expectations. But frankly, the ones that look promising and don't deliver are more disappointing than the ones that didn't look appetizing in the first place. You get what I'm saying, right?

11 May 2022,jiju10,5," Loved it till Season 4
","When Marvelous Mrs Maisel premiered in 2017, it brought with it an intriguing, powerful, and well-written critique on women in society. The show managed to create a terrific balance of comedy and drama because to Miriam's wit and comedic prowess on stage, more than holding her own against husband Joel.",/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2019,jordan2240,5," We keep watching, but I'm not sure why
","By season 3, the main character has gotten almost too annoying to watch. I find the rhythm in her dialog delivery grating, and the character herself is deserving of little respect and empathy. The Susie and Abe characters generally delivered the only humorous lines in the show (which were few and far between), but Susie has gotten to the point where they are relying solely on vulgarity for humor, which misses more than it hits (though it does hit occasionally). I think they've added too many story lines in season 3, and they've also added a number of musical sequences, most of which just make the episode longer than necessary. I think they could have easily cut each episode down to about half and hour, which would make it a bit easier to sit through. If there is a season 4, I'm not sure I'll continue watching. Can't speak for the wife, but she rarely even chuckles during any of the episodes, so I'm not sure how entertained she is by them either. This has become one of those series where we feel almost obligated to finish a season because we've already invested so much time in it, but as with 'The Affair,' which we stopped watching after the first couple of shows in season 5, we might not give the next season much time to impress us.",/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2019,moviemom23,6," Started s. 3 but I think I might be done
",Season 1 was amazing. Season 2 was a mixed bag but I mostly enjoyed it. Season 3 is getting unwatchable for me.,/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2018,karenn1,10," What a Gem! Amazing Doesn't Begin to Cover it.
","I almost missed this series. I was half way through the first episode, wasn't invested in any of the characters, and saw nothing amazing enough to make we watch the second episode. But, I hung in, deciding to watch the entire episode, as I had some free time to waste. There's something like a nuclear bomb that gets dropped just before this episode ends, and if you miss that, you'll miss the brilliance behind the rest of the series. Midge suddenly becomes, and remains, so much more than amazing. She's one of the most delicious characters I've seen in a very long time. Clever repartee, an array of quirky characters, and a machine gun approach to dialogue that drew me into hanging onto every exchange, even though I usually agonize through four letter words. They aren't constant enough to assault those who don't appreciate them, so it was a small price to pay for some of the best screenwriting I've seen in a long time. Don't miss this series!",/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2022,samsonchui,5," Season 4? You mean season bore
","My favourite show for last 3 seasons.....
Then it became dull AF",/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2020,A_Different_Drummer,7," show commits suicide in S03 -- no note found at the scene
","Wasn't streaming supposed to usher in a new universe where shows got better over time without the network watchdogs on their heels? First season brilliant. Awards. Prestige. Double everyone's salary. Learn how to graciously accept awards. Second season did not raise the bar but thankfully held it. Third season cringe-worthy, episodes so off-track you will wear out the fast forward button. As if the writers/producers developed amnesia and forgot what made the show a hit in the first place.",/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv

",I just binge watched both seasons of Mrs. Maisel.,/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2022,mainspring-03696,4," Season 4 has got to pot
","The show has gone so far away from Seasons 1-3 that after watching S04 Ep 1, we won't waste any more time on this show.",/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2020,Scott_Mercer,1," Irritating
","Unrealistic overwritten dialog, contrived storytelling and woeful plot mechanics.",/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2021,trademarcdesigns,7," Great start but slipping off the rails
","I thought Season 1 was great. By no means an accurate reflection of life in the 1950's, but hey, all sitcoms are 90% fantasy, right?",/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2022,riverzak,2," Season Four Has Lost Its Way
","It took a few episodes of season one before I was hooked. The story arc through the first three seasons was interesting and the characters were well written and entertaining. That all goes away in season four where Midge's career has come to a standstill. Season four seems to have no forward momentum at all, and now we are just treated to characters who talk non-stop rapid-fire. It would be one thing if the dialog was interesting, but unfortunately it's just annoying.",/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2022,caeevans,2," Season 4, is this a comedy?
","I don't know what the ... happened, but this season is appalling. It is not funny, the story line is repeating itself and some of the choices the characters are making, just don't make sense. I understand that there will be a season 5, but let's face it, if anyone keeps watching, it will only be to see Susie.",/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2019,mmwea,1," UNWATCHABLE-ABOVE ALL, UNFUNNY!
","I am so tired of hearing people rave about this juvenile show. What is the matter with our culture-to think that this inane show is worth watching? I have tried and tried; I think I've watched the first three or four episodes at least twice each, but I always just get angry. Have our standards really fallen that much? The worst thing about it is that she never says a single thing that's funny. You have all these audiences laughing their heads off, and you don't even smile, because none of it is funny. It's just awful. It's also loaded with period anachronisms and NY Jewish stereotypes, but that's another story. Ugh!",/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2022,postofficecb,9," The most refreshing comedy in years
","This is a comedy about stand-up comedy, so it has to be pretty darn witty. And it is. But it's so much more.",/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2019,jkp-309-258974,6," Season 3, Episode 1, shark has been jumped.
","Season 1: 9/10, Season 2: 9/10, Season 3: 1/10 equals 6 stars overall. I'm not great at math, but you get the idea.",/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2022,johnpmoseley,2," Twinkling mischievously is no substitute for being actually funny
","Think about this show in the abstract and it could have been so great: conventional, straightlaced, socially hidebound Upper West Side newlywed's life falls apart causing her to come down to the Village and out of her shell and become the cool, revolutionary, taboo-busting and brilliantly funny female Lenny Bruce.",/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2020,melinapaz,5," A little overrated...
","This show is from the same creators of Gilmore Girls (I watched the show when I was a teen; a guilty pleasure for which I am ashamed now that I re watched one episode to remember) and it has exactly the same plot, except that is a jewish family in the 50'.
There are so many repeated relationship patterns and even some dialogues looks the same.
Even the actress looks a little bit like Rory Gilmore from the other show.
The same spoiled brat self-centered princess, always playing with people feelings but never assuming it and hidding herself behind a ""I'm so naive and cute you can't hate me"" costume.......
It is so insulting to women that actually want to be taken serious.
The show has some good moments but I don't understand the 10/10 reviews.",/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2022,melissablakley,6," Seasons 1-3 great! Season 4 what happened?
",I wonder if this happens when it's too long between seasons. Maybe i just lost interest in caring what happens to the characters. Maybe Ive changed and things I used to find funny and adorable are now annoying and boring. I don't know but i am sad about this show. Season 4 is just awful.,/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2020,pritypoddar,8," Most of Miriam's bold and brazen standup-comedy acts are funny and interesting
","Mrs. Miriam ""Midge"" Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan), is a beautiful, poised, witty and Jewish housewife of the late 1950s and early 1960s, in New York City, who out of the blue realises that she has the talent and urge to be a stand-up comedian and goes on to pursue a career in it with full force and focus. This includes separating from Joel Maisel (Michael Zegen) her loving, gentleman but cheating husband and leaving her two children under her mother's care, while she goes out or travels for work.",/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2022,Phylum22,3," Loved it, til season 4
","Just cannot get into it, there is no story, just a family flitting around bickering. I think I'm done with this. Shame, as I did loved it, now I cannot be bothered.",/review/rw8043766/?ref_=tt_urv
