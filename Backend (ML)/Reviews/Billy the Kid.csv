27 February 2006,ccthemovieman-1,10," Very Worthy Sequel To A Great Film
","This is an outstanding sequel to an outstanding movie The Fugitive (1993). In this film, the focus is on the team that was searching for Dr. Richard Kimble in the first movie. That team was led by Tommy Lee Jones, who won an Oscar for his performance, which probably helped spur this sequel. It worked, as Jones and company (Joe Pantoliano and others) are just as much fun to watch as they were in The Fugitive.",/review/rw1601845/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 1999,rupie,7," pretty good followup
","Okay, so ""U.S.Marshalls"" is basically just a remake of ""The Fugitive"". As such, it received lukewarm to cool reviews when it was in the theaters, unjustifiedly so, I think. Although the plot line is a ripoff of the earlier movie, this one does well in keeping us in suspense as to the story behind the central character, and the action is exciting and well-paced. Tommy Lee Jones of course ""makes"" the film, accompanied by the same cast of deputies as in the earlier movie. There are even ""toppers"" for the bus crash/train wreck and famous swan dive from the earlier movie. This is a very good escapist action flick.",/review/rw1601845/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2016,Leofwine_draca,8," A sequel - and equal - to The Fugitive
","A sequel and equal to THE FUGITIVE, this exciting, highly watchable thriller deserved a much bigger success than the lacklustre performance it had when released in the cinemas. I just don't understand why people didn't like it, except that perhaps there is a case of 'seen it before', as there is much the same feel to it as THE FUGITIVE. However, the film is by no means a copy, the plot is completely different and offers up many new situations, the only thing which is directly lifted from the original is the opening crash, this time by plane instead of train.",/review/rw1601845/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 1999,bat-5,7," Decent action film.
","U. S. Marshals has Tommy Lee Jones as Sam Gerard, his Oscar winning role from The Fugitive, chasing after Wesley Snipes. After a quite spectacular plane crash, the hunt is on. Snipes trying to prove he's innocent of crimes he didn't commit and Jones and his team of bloodhounds relentlessly searching for him. There is no skimping on the action and the leap from a building to a moving train is one nifty stunt. The only trouble I have is that you don't care enough about Wesley Snipes' character as you do for Harrison Ford in The Fugitive. Wesley Snipes is a former spy in the film, and he uses his skills to evade the cops. Ford was just a doctor, with no special training at all. Still, for an action film, this one delivers.",/review/rw1601845/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2003,shakey_jake53,," strong sequel
","Great follow up to THE FUGITIVE with Tommy Lee Jones this time chasing Wesley Snipes.  Both leads are great and the supporting cast is solid as well.  The action scene's are very good as well.  A few in particular include the search for Snipes in the swamp, and the airplane crash.  The only problem with the film was it was a little longer than it should've been, but aside from that its a solid sequel.  4/5",/review/rw1601845/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2006,mOVIemAN56,7," Solid and suspenseful, enjoyable the whole way through
","I have never seen The Fugitive which is the predecessor to this film, but what I saw in U.S. Marshals, I don't think The Fugitive could be any better. U.S. Marshals is the action/ thriller film and fan of the genre would drool over. ",/review/rw1601845/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2000,gbheron,6," Borderline Good
","U.S. Marshals is the sequel to The Fugitive, but feels more like a remake. Again a victim of injustice is improperly imprisoned, this time Wesley Snipes in the Harrison Ford role. He's not a surgeon, but a deep undercover spy, the victim of a frame-up of an undisclosed nature. A catastrophic accident frees him (this time a plane crash) and again Tommy Lee Jones is sent to hunt him down. Big-budget, good special effects, A-list actors doing their jobs well; still U.S. Marshals fails to make a big impact. The first quarter starts out great, but by the end of the movie the plot devices are becoming very routine. Not a rip-off, but only C+ to me.",/review/rw1601845/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2007,jthelin,8," Once More with Feeling!
","I avoided this for years because it looked like a useless remake. However, I had forgotten that I thought The Fugitive was a useless remake of the TV series until I was dragged to it and founda fine, suspenseful feature filled with a plethora of colorful characters. So, I should have been tuned in more to my own personal history, but so it goes.I now have watched U.S. Marshalls a number of times, and I have to say the two companion films match each other in quality.",/review/rw1601845/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2002,michaelRokeefe,6," A good cop doesn't quit. Even an innocent man will run.
","Tommy Lee Jones repeats his role as now Chief Deputy Marshal Sam Gerard in this sequel. And again he is on the trail of another wrongly accused man(Wesley Snipes), who won't give up to prove his innocence. Good story line. Some real good action scenes. Not only are Jones and Snipes excellent. Very good performances from Kate Nelligan and Robert Downey Jr. Nelligan his boss and Downey Jr is the special agent who gives his unsolicited aid. Very worthwhile.",/review/rw1601845/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2005,beau geste 38,7," ""Go git him Tommy Lee""
","""We got ourselves a fugitive."" Go git him Tommy Lee. Only this time the  fugitive (Snipes as Sheridan) ) is a cross between Rambo, Houdini, and  Superman (he actually flies). Unless you've got the I.Q. of a pigeon,  you should be able to work out where this one is going. There's a lot  of action, as expected, with the good guys dodging bullets, and the  special effects are great. The team are still full of great one-liners,  but the plot is complicated by Robert Downey Jr.(Royce), and the F.B.I. You've  probably seen it anyway, so maybe you just need to decide if it's worth  a second viewing. It probably is, if you're a Tommy Lee fan. The French  bird is gorgeous in this.",/review/rw1601845/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2009,elshikh4,7," ""The Great Samuel Gerard"" !
","Since I first watched it as a rented video on September, 6, 1999, it became a classic action. Few movies have that rank in my book. Here, the journey of Marshal (Samuel Gerard) continues, however with another fugitive. Most of Hollywood sequels are badly-written, pretty hasty, and repeat their original at best. But this time, it even outclassed its original. (The Fugitive - 1993) was well-made entertainment, yet too long, somehow uninteresting with Mr. (Harrison Ford), not to mention that I remember falling asleep in front of it at the first watching! While I have been hooked by (U.S. Marshals), for countless times.",/review/rw1601845/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2005,callanvass,10," Not As Good As The Fugitive But Still A Fantastic Sequel, With Tense And Exciting Action, And 2 Amazing Performances From Tommy Lee Jones And Wesley Snipes!
","This is not as good as The Fugitive but it's still fantastic sequel, with tense and exciting action and 2 amazing performances from Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes!. All the characters are fantastic!, and the story is awesome!, plus Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes are simply amazing in this!. It's quite underrated in my opinion, and i thought Wesley Snipes made a very sympathetic fugitive in my opinion!, plus The finale is surprising and very exciting!. A lot of people complained that Tommy Lee Jones was on auto pilot here i completely disagree, while he wasn't as good as his Oscar worthy performance in the Fugitive he was still amazing, and it's unpredictable throughout for the most part!, plus the plain crash sequence was just crazy! and very exciting stuff. It started out a bit disappointing, but then really picks up for the rest of the film, and i thought Robert Downey Jr. was excellent in his role!, plus the chase sequences were just excellent! in my opinion!. This is not as good as The Fugitive but it's still a fantastic sequel, with tense and exciting action and 2 amazing performances from Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes!, and i say Go see it now!. The Direction is fantastic!. Stuart Baird does a fantastic job here, with awesome camera work, fantastic angles, and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. The acting is wonderful!. Tommy Lee Jones is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is very intense, likable, had some cool lines, was fascinating to watch, and despite what people say he was not on Auto pilot, he gave it his all in my opinion and while he didn't deliver an Oscar worthy performance like he did in the fugitive he was still amazing! (Tommy Lee Rules!!!). Wesley Snipes is also amazing as always, here, he played a very sympathetic Fugitive in my opinion, was very likable, smart, and just did anything to survive, he is also very charismatic and was perfect for this role!, it's one of his best performances! (Snipes Rules!!!!). Robert Downey Jr. is excellent in his role here, he played it very low key but it worked, and made his character mysterious and very interesting i loved him!. Joe Pantoliano is great in his role i liked him lots. Daniel Roebuck did what he had to do well, which was not much. Kate Nelligan is excellent as the U.S marshal, she was likable, an had some good scenes with Tommy Lee, i just wished she had more screen time. Tom Wood (Dep. marshal Noah Newman),Marie Bineaux(Snipe's girlfriend), Donald Gibb, and the rest all do great with what they had to do!. Overall Go see it now!. ***** out of 5",/review/rw1601845/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2000,boberck,7," Gets better toward the end
","If you can tolerate Gerard's smugness, and get through the slow beginning, the movie rewards you with a lot of action, intrigue, and chases.  Of course, we know how it is going to end, but that's okay because this is an action film, not a mystery.  The actors do a good job,  but Downey Jr. plays it a little too stiffly.",/review/rw1601845/?ref_=tt_urv

On the plane is a prisoner with many aliases (Wesley Snipes) who was picked up after a car accident. On the plane, somebody tries to kill him only to damage the plane forcing it to crash.

","Yet another movie ruined by Tommy Lee Jones :(
This should have been a Snipes vehicle with Wes at this best but Snipes was woefully underused and Jones/Downey et al managed to ruin a perfectly good Wesley Snipes film! Who'd believe Downey or Jones could whup Snipes in hand to hand combat?",/review/rw1601845/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2003,perfectbond,7," Not bad at all
","U.S. Marshals is a good action film. The stunts and special effects are spectacular and the talented cast, though breaking no new artistic ground, is very good at bringing their characters to life. No, it isn't quite up to the standard of The Fugitive but it is a solidly entertaining movie all the same. 7/10.",/review/rw1601845/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2012,ersinkdotcom,8," Good sequel to the great ""The Fugitive""
","What do you do when you release a movie and the co-star's character makes just as much of an impact on viewers as the main actor? Obviously you find a way to exploit the situation by coming up with another project to put that actor and character into. That's exactly what producers of ""The Fugitive"" did with Tommy Lee Jones' law enforcer, Sam Gerard.",/review/rw1601845/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2012,bkoganbing,5," Why do they keep sending him after innocent guys?
","Capitalizing on the success that Tommy Lee Jones scored in The Fugitive, his character of Marshal Sam Gerard was given the lead in US Marshals where he is once again going after an innocent man. In this case Jones's target is Wesley Snipes who is not only an accused murderer of two agents, but he's accused of treason as well, passing secrets to the People's Republic of China.",/review/rw1601845/?ref_=tt_urv

30 August 1999,Latte,9," A worthy successor
","I saw the trailer for this film a while ago, and it appealed to me immediately. It's a pseudo-sequel to 'The Fugitive', but don't think that it's the same film all over again. 'US Marshalls' is a perfect stand-alone film, meaning you can watch this film and enjoy it without having seen 'The Fugitive' first.",/review/rw1601845/?ref_=tt_urv

18 February 2007,sveknu,7," Great movie
","With a great cast consisting of Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes, this movie simply had to be good. Everything is performed quality-style here. The story is great, although it can be a little difficult to follow. I didn't get the whole deal before my second viewing. Not that it mattered to much, since there are lots and lots of really cool action scenes all the way through. Snipes is great, and lots of exciting and interesting things happen throughout the whole movie. Tommy Lee Jones almost always makes a movie better with his appearance, and ""U.S. Marshals"" is no exception. His role is about the same as in ""The Fugitive"". If you liked that one, you'll definitely enjoy ""U.S. Marshals"" too.",/review/rw1601845/?ref_=tt_urv
