13 February 2022,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," What have ye done?
","'My Son (2021)' is an experimental film in which a man returns to Scotland after receiving news that his son has gone missing. James McAvoy apparently improvises every scene he's in (which is most of them), forced to fumble his way around a plot which he doesn't know and actors who have the knowledge he is deprived of. Some scenes seem as though they must have been more controlled than others (for instance, when the protagonist decides to beat someone up or does a bit of self-led investigation) and others still must have been filmed more than once (McAvoy has recounted a time in which he decided to climb a tree and was told that this decision was ""stupid"" by the director). For the most part, McAvoy manages to make his way through the picture not only without cracking up, but also without delivering anything less than a cohesive and believable performance. He is mostly a passenger in his own story, which is somewhat frustrating but also encapsulates the feeling of being caught up in a devastating situation without the ability to truly affect it. He occasionally hesitates to take action, too (presumably for fear of ruining a take). Of course, the film is also peppered with generally awkward and clumsy moments that stem from its unusual approach to its material, but it's relatively easy to forgive these flaws when you keep in mind just how difficult it must be to ad-lib an entire movie. However, the more I think about it, the more I wonder if its experimental nature actually warrants any extra lenience. After all, the filmmakers decided that this was the best way to tell their story and, at times, their unorthodox method definitely impacts that story in a negative way. Having said that, most of the problems with the piece don't actually stem from its most obvious gimmick. Instead, they arise from the fact that the underlying narrative is paced pretty poorly, structured somewhat strangely and is generally rather generic overall. The first half is pretty much a straightforward drama, while the second steers the story into thriller territory. Both segments carry a strong sense of realism, but they seem at odds with one another when it comes to defining the flick's overall intention. The actual plot is barebones and stuffed with coincidences, far less involving than a thriller really ought to be. Furthermore, several plot elements are introduced and then almost immediately dropped, which exactly doesn't make for a particularly satisfying experience. The more you reflect on the piece, the more hollow it seems. Its actual ending is a real dud, too. Still, it's not as if the picture is entirely unsuccessful. As I mentioned earlier, McAvoy turns in really respectable work and pretty much carries the entire film on his shoulders, which is all the more impressive considering he has no idea what's actually going on most of the time. The finale is also really suspenseful, a grounded and engaging game of cat and mouse with solid stakes and a steady execution. The movie has a decently effective emotional underpinning and it features some surprisingly striking cinematography - primarily when it comes to composition and lighting - that somehow doesn't immediately signal that the camera operators don't actually always know where their star is going to end up. Ultimately, though, I can't imagine watching this without knowing its experimental gimmick. That foreknowledge makes the feature much more interesting than it actually is, prompting forgiveness of its flaws and admiration of its execution. It's impressive that the film turned out well at all considering how much could have gone wrong. When you think about it, though, it shouldn't be noteworthy that a movie is ""good enough"", no matter what gimmick it employs. After all, the filmmakers decided to make things harder on themselves, to use an unorthodox and difficult method presumably in the pursuit of good art. Why would you go through all that extra stress if the result wasn't going to be dramatically improved by it? With a bit more planning, this could've been something really special; as I mentioned before, the underlying story is more of an issue than its actual execution. If the flick wasn't largely improvised, I suspect it would've slipped straight onto 'Amazon Prime' without much fanfare (although, to be fair, it hasn't received much attention as it is). It's good enough for what it is, but it could've been much better. Still, it's worth watching if its USP is intriguing to you. 6/10.",/review/rw7390793/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2022,Prismark10,4," My Son
",My Son is an improvised child abduction thriller. It is a remake of a French movie called Mon Garçon.,/review/rw7390793/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2021,arungeorge13,4," This ""thriller"" doesn't have either a head or a tail. [+41%]
","A thriller simply cannot run on the basis of a gimmick (of its protagonist mouthing totally improvised dialogue) - it needs a plot and neatly packaged twists & turns to keep viewers invested. My Son starts off with interesting what-ifs and frame choices. But writer-director Christian Carion struggles to develop well-rounded characters or convey a coherent story. The tension is practically non-existent after the opening scene. The thrills are absent. The biggest disappointment, however, is that Carion settles for an extremely weak finale - one that undoes all of its initial intrigue. Plot points are barely touched upon and conveniently brushed aside, while the antagonists are poorly etched. McAvoy tries. He definitely tries. But the film can't stand on its own two feet because of the bland, powerless writing.",/review/rw7390793/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2021,emmabmurphy,5," Good acting, storyline not so much.
",James McAvoy was fantastic as always but I was left asking a few questions in the end. Aspects of the plot were only hinted at but not explored properly.,/review/rw7390793/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2021,yahiaaqil,4," Totally Misleading and Poor!
","I don't know what is going on with writers and directors nowadays. Do they write a plot and then forget about it while shooting? So the father works in the petrol field in some ""dangerous"" countries in the Middle East, even if he isn't in the military, but still dangerous for people like him, well according to the movies of course! After buying that nonsense, the movie raises the question: why your son? And they relate the answer to the dad's dangerous job wooow spooky!",/review/rw7390793/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,Lejink,7," Ghosts of Princes In Towers
","An English-language remake, by the same director, of a French-made film originally released in 2017. I've not seen that but can't imagine it was much more sombre than the Scottish locations transferred to here. It's a dark, unsettling film about the disappearance from an outdoor, lochside children's camp of a seven-year old boy. As we join the action his father, James McAvoy has just flown into the country and arrives to meet up with his ex-wife and assist the police with their enquiries, as the phrase goes. It soon becomes apparent though that McAvoy, whilst undoubtedly a doting father, is a bit of a loose cannon. Although his occupation is never revealed to the audience, it seems he is some kind of paid mercenary who works in some of the world's hottest hot-spots.",/review/rw7390793/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2021,jtindahouse,8," Really entertaining but there's a lot of unnecessary distractions
","I often think of the quote, ""It never comes back"", from 'The Disaster Artist'. 'My Son' is a little guilty of having some of those moments. Apparently James McAvoy, who is incredible in this film, was never given a script so as to get natural reactions to events that crop up along the way. Fun idea. The problem is that it feels like they put a lot of random and irrelevant plot points into the movie to get reactions out of him. They never come back. It's quite odd. In spite of this the movie is still pretty darn good.",/review/rw7390793/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,Spartan_1_1_7,6," It's not groundbreaking or anything like that. A small mystery thriller that's passable with good performances by the leads.
","My Son (2021) is a mystery thriller about a divorced father trying to deal with the situation of his son going missing. I love James McAvoy and Claire Foy, so seeing them starring in a movie together made me curious to check this out, and also apparently the fact that McAvoy wasn't given a script or dialogues and instead improvised throughout the movie.",/review/rw7390793/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2021,Rob-O-Cop,5," generic abduction, quickly stopped by father, set in scotland, the end
","Apart from the beautiful bleak cinematography and scenery and decent acting there's nothing much to this film. Everything is wrapped up pretty quickly and most of the time is spent watching the characters creep around a damp abandoned building in the dark. Then it's over and we don't really arrive anywhere or learn anything. Blah blah something about a giant covert child abduction ring that leads to the top of the police force, but that never gets looked at.",/review/rw7390793/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2021,kuarinofu,5," It was ok, but the story was way too loose
","'My Son' is an ok film for a one-time watch. It looks neat, McAvoy is consistently good, there are some tense scenes (although very dark), and the score is memorable.",/review/rw7390793/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2022,isaacochoterena,5," Not the best execution
","It's a movie that may hold promise, but eventually falls.",/review/rw7390793/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,3," How do you make the same movie twice, and screw it up both times?
","Writer, producer and director Christian Carion made the exact same film in 2017 in French. Then does it again in English set in the Scottish landscapes, and again fails to provide a coherent and cohesive story, that was riddled with plot and technical issues and nonsense irrelevant garbled scenes that were pulled out of thin air. This is the epitome of failed writing and directing.",/review/rw7390793/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2022,gallagherkellie,3," Beautiful scenery...boring movie
",Not one thing about this movie kept me entertained or engrossed. I get looking at my phone and checking how long I had left. The scenery is gorgeous which is where the few stars came from. Otherwise barely anything happens in this movie!,/review/rw7390793/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2021,SupaStyles1,6," Good acting, decent plot but lacking
","For a movie that dragged in places the ending was a bit disappointing. Like they couldn't take a few minutes to really sus out everything that was really going on, just a quick de-brief in a car ride and no explanation of what happened with his job.",/review/rw7390793/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2021,PaxD75,4," Uninspired performances, poor script.
","Average with splashes of meh. There's a bit of mystery because we're trying to figure out who took Ethan. Despite the mystery (which we know will occur during the reveal), the movie is very linear in a very subdued manner.",/review/rw7390793/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2021,balozoli,5," I was trying, I swear
","I wanted to love it so much, but I just couldn't. Claire is more than good, James is trying, as we know he wasn't given a script and he does what he can, but it clearly doesn't add anything to the movie. And there's a story, we've seen a few times before, nothing new under the Sun. Unfortunately, just another average movie.",/review/rw7390793/?ref_=tt_urv

","Can some explain some of the scenes in the movie, for instance, what was the point of his office being trashed? The ending?? Why?? Who was responsible for the abductions? No this was seriously out of context movie. Yes it was very very dark, but sometimes I just wondered Why.",/review/rw7390793/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've seen the original film, the French version which at first seems slow but get pretty good towards the end. . This one pretty much as same..

24 January 2022,vzrztpkmq,1," Unbelievable
","Another film that just makes no logical sense. Police telling a family ""you're on your own"" when their child is missing!! Complete nonsense it never happens and makes the film completely unbelievable and unbearable to watch.

29 September 2021,Neptune165,4," I'm still confused what this movie is
","One of the worst movies ever. Don't even waste your time. I've watched it just for James. How is that even possible? No script? How does he know what comes next? How does he know how to react, where to run, who to take a swing at? You know? It quite incredible. James literally disappeared after getting beaten up. Also it just miraculously happens that his ex-wife's brother works in insurance and they found the address of the kidnapper so easy. Not that good.",/review/rw7390793/?ref_=tt_urv
