29 September 2018,Her-Excellency,7," Not bad. In fact, quite good ... BUT ...
","Once you get over a bit of a slow start, the film proves to be entertaining and engrossing, and it draws attention to the inner, sometimes dirty, machinations of government and the jurisdictional ""system"". The acting is also pretty much all-around top-notch. ",/review/rw4219919/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2018,nothimme,7," It's a worthy follow-up
","This is one of those action movies that it only job is to give you as real as possible experience with its beautiful cinematography. It doesn't feel as real as ''Children of Men'' and it probably won't get a Oscar but it serves its job. The movie may not be as masterful as Villeneuve's original, but it achieves to keep you on the screen. There are really good heart-pumping scenes that beautifully blended with the score in its convoluted plot. Just like in the first movie, the story gets darker and darker. It reflects real-life situations, that's why it's so dreary and compelling. All the events is a buildup to our main story. It all ties together perfectly in the end. And even though key cast member Emily Blunt no longer here, the movie stands alone as a powerful modern-day Western, thanks to the Josh Brolin, Benicio del Toro, and Taylor Sheridan who also penned the screenplay of the first movie.",/review/rw4219919/?ref_=tt_urv

They decide to begin a war among the cartels and an unofficial command is assigned to kidnap the daughter of a kingpin and release her in the land of another cartel. However, when the government discovers that the responsible for the terrorist attack were American citizens from New Jersey, they decide to abort the plan and kill the girl.

9 March 2019,bob the moo,," Solidly tense and engaging, but not as smart or thrilling as it is slick
","The first Sicario film was a surprise to me, and I enjoyed it for its slick thrills but also its darkness and twists and turns; like many I looked forward to the sequel - or rather, the next film, since this isn't really a sequel so much as a film with the same characters. The film places the characters into an unofficial war with the cartels where US forces try to engineer wars between the cartels to make them weaken and distract each other. This action is started due to terrorists being brought into the US as part of human smuggling run by the cartels - which gives the film an opening few minutes that matches the first film for impact.",/review/rw4219919/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2018,Jared_Andrews,6," Stellar Acting, Exciting Action, But Lacks Awareness
","Sequels typically strive to go bigger and badder than the original. This sequel is no exception. This issue with attempting to up the ante is that it often causes sequels to lose sight of what made the original special. Again, this sequel is no exception.",/review/rw4219919/?ref_=tt_urv

","Okay, so this doesn't come close to the first movie in the series. But, it comes close enough to being close that it's much more than watchable. It's actually a very good movie. If it was a standalone movie and Sicario never happened, people would more appreciative. Del Toro is his usual badass self. The cartels and U.S. law enforcement are brutal, per the usual. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys fast action.",/review/rw4219919/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2018,bbretall-1,4," Creates and discards plots throughout the film
","Reading the reviews, it seems you either love this or hate it. I unfortunately fall in the latter category.
I am usually REALLY soft and forgiving on plot holes and other minor quirks in a movie as long as I am entertained. This film did NOT keep me entertained, and was in no way a worthy successor to the original Sicario. This movie had multiple-personality disorder. It would start going with a plot-line, then completely drop it and switch gears to something else. Ultimately it just felt like a confusing jumble.
It is sub-titled ""Day of the Soldier"" and that's an apt name, all of the far too few action sequences had highly trained & heavily armed US Special Forces guys completely overwhelming their opponents. No real tension at all. Maybe something to love here for ""rah-rah America, see how they can pummel those backward foreigners!!"" but I found it to be lacking in any punch.
The trailers had this seem like a ""war on the drug cartels"" film. There is virtually none of that as the film mostly bogs down in a really contrived kidnapping scheme that was supposed to set off a war between the cartels, but the film showed NONE of that.
Brolin & his team just go across the border into Mexico at will in helicopters and armored vehicles and end up slaughtering lots of people, most of whom are not even obvious cartel members (yes, they WORK for the cartels, but I'd have liked to see engagement with some actual Cartel forces, not Federales and lawyers who work for them). 
This film highlights American aggression and is strong on a total disregard for Mexico's sovereignty with a bit of ""Muslim fear/hysteria"" thrown in and then quickly abandoned.
That said....acting by Brolin & Del Toro was top-notch, but not enough to save this mish-mash with no cohesive through-plot and plot fragments that had holes wide enough to fly one of the military helicopters through.",/review/rw4219919/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2019,jtindahouse,8," A sequel that does the original proud
","While I did enjoy the original 'Sicario' I admit I found it a little slow paced and tedious in places. As with most sequels 'Sicario: Day of the Soldado' comes out with guns blazing (literally) trying to one up its predecessor. The first 2/3 of this film are electric and everything I wanted them to be. Then sadly the final 1/3 couldn't deliver the knock-out punch. It went down some channels that I wasn't particularly fond of, and ignored some that I would have loved to have seen. Don't get me wrong though, this is a very entertaining and well made film.",/review/rw4219919/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2018,kosmasp,8," Follow up
","The original still stands out and is overall better than the sequel. But this comes really close. As sequels go, this is really one of the better ones, which is not a bad thing to say about a movie that people will compare to a movie that seemed to be coming out of the blue and surprising a lot of people. In a good sense, but also with the level of violence and it's nature, which was along the lines of take no prisoners.",/review/rw4219919/?ref_=tt_urv

15 September 2018,CinemaClown,," A Worthy Follow-Up To A Film That Never Required a Sequel In The First Place
","What would've sufficed as Soldado was given a different title in an attempt by the studio to increase its box-office potential by cashing on the original's success. However, despite bearing all the hallmarks of a straight-to-DVD feature, there is a certain quality to it that makes it a worthy instalment to a film that never needed one.",/review/rw4219919/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2018,Troy_Campbell,9," A riveting and challenging sequel.
","2018 will henceforth be known as the Year of the Brolin. First was the indomitable Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War, then the badass antihero Cable in Deadpool 2, and now Josh Brolin returns to his morally shady CIA operative Matt Graver in the follow-up to 2015 masterpiece Sicario. Continuing the war on drugs using any and all methods available, while smashing ethical and legal boundaries every step of the way, Graver and his team (including Benicio del Toro's scene-stealing hitman Alejandro) kidnap the daughter of a drug kingpin in the hope of starting a Cartel war. Less of a direct sequel and more of a new chapter with familiar faces, filmmaker Stefano Sollima and returning screenwriter Taylor Sheridan concoct a hard-hitting tale existing within the murky fog of war. Heroes and villains blur, good and bad weave in and out of each other, and right and wrong are concepts that simply add no value to understanding the dilemma. It's rare for a movie to be this intellectually and morally uncomfortable, but that's what makes it so damn riveting. Italian director Sollima steps into Denis Villenueve's shoes without missing a beat, allowing the dread to simmer underneath the surface and the tension to build to unbearable levels through meticulous pacing and unnervingly long shots. Yet when it explodes, it does so with gritty aplomb. The set pieces are crafted with a tough and uncompromising realism, the businesslike choreography and thundering sound design reminiscent of Michael Mann's classic Heat. Taking over from composer Johann Johannsson (who sadly passed away earlier this year), Hildur Guðnadóttir delivers an atmospheric score that not only supplements proceedings but imbues it with next-level suspense and heft. A powerhouse leading duo, expert direction and a provocatively complex narrative, Sicario: Day of the Soldado is an action-thriller firing on all cylinders.",/review/rw4219919/?ref_=tt_urv

","The first Sicario was pretty awesome at every level. The story was great, the actors were outstanding, and the action was intense. The second one is a lot more like a Liam Neeson or old school Charles Bronson movie. Revenge, bad guys that kill people, tracking them down for a final confrontation, killing lots of people on the way. It is not awesome like the first movie, but as a standard lets kill lots of bad guys movie, it delivers the excitement, the gun-battles, and the body count.",/review/rw4219919/?ref_=tt_urv

2 July 2018,The-Sarkologist,9," Stunning
","Woah, now this is one of those films that left me completely blown at the end. In fact I'm going to go as far as to suggest that it is even better than the original. Okay, you probably do need to see the original to get an idea of who the two main characters are, but still, it does manage to stand on its own in any case. The other thing is that there are so many twists, and the film certainly doesn't go in the way that you would expect it to go, that it pretty much left me stunned right through to the end.
 Anyway, the film opens by mentioning how people smuggling from Mexico into the United States is the new big thing, and then we have a terrorist attack in a supermarket in Kansas. Suspicion starts to fall upon the Mexican cartels, particularly since in a recent bust some prayer mats were discovered. So, our friend from the first movie is called in to basically shake up a few trees and get some information, and they suspect that the cartels are behind this new way of smuggling people into the United States. So, they decide that it would be best to start a war between the cartels.
 Well, this is where it get's interesting, because our Sicario from the first movie is called in to basically kick a hornet's nest in Mexico, which he does, and then they decide to kidnap the daughter of one of the cartel leaders and attempt to pin the blame on the other cartels, and then it starts to get really, really messy, but I'll leave it at that because, well, that would be giving way too much away.
 Actually, I do wonder at times what their actual plan is as it seems to be pretty convoluted. Also, we have some ambushes that aren't really explained either, but then again, when we are dealing with the Cartels we never actually know what is really going on. The thing is that these gangs generally want to shake the tree a bit, and use violence to extract whatever dues they can extract from others.
 One thing that came across from the other film is that there are a couple of scenes that seem to be completely unconnected, but if you know what's going on then you know that they will end up being connected somewhere along the line. This film is all about people smuggling, so of course we have a young Mexican-American being lured into the business, namely because he is American and can get through things that others can't. Then again, you also wonder whether if you are connected with such people if you are little more than expendable.
 I think they also try to confront you at times with the reality of the situation, but then again sometimes I wonder whether this film is just another dig at the Mexicans, one of the many groups that seem to be scapegoated at this time. Sure, there are concerns with the drug cartels down south, but there are things that also aren't mentioned, such as a lot of the people crossing from Mexico aren't actually Mexican - they are from further south. Still, despite that I did think that this was a pretty awesome film, and I don't feel that it demonises Mexicans as much as some would expect.",/review/rw4219919/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2019,Leofwine_draca,7," Better than the first
","Unlike most reviewers I found this SICARIO follow-up to be superior to the first. Emily Blunt took me out of the first film in a big way; I never found her character convincing for a second and much preferred the performances of Brolin and Del Toro. The good news is that they're back but she isn't. The plot once again involves American interference in cartel politics south of the border; there's a big mission to carry out and some great suspense sequences as everything goes very wrong indeed. I find DAY OF THE SOLDADO's director to be in command of his film in every respect, whether it's the cinematic grittiness, the lack of a moral compass, the superb action scenes or the incessant foreboding that carries the story through.",/review/rw4219919/?ref_=tt_urv
