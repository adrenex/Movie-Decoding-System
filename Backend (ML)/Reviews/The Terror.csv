",Short review here but I'm sure this highlights real life situations. Bit awkward watching to be honest but is definitely worth a watch.,/review/rw8055895/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2020,safenoe,8," I am
","I'm surprised there aren't many more user reviews for this fine series that focuses on three women in separate stories: Nicola, Kirsty and Hannah. All were top notch, but Kirsty is the one that really grabs you the most, with the realization that many could be just one paycheck away from baked beans for dinner and no TV or sofa.",/review/rw8055895/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2021,pghopkins,10," Superb and compelling
","There's not much cinema nor TV I'd watch a second time. These, just six, episodes I would watch again. Each of the six main female actors were outstanding in the women they played, in their delivery, in their moments of passion, anger, despair in six superbly told stories of women at a crossroads in their lives, lives complicated by love, by loneliness, by want and need and by loss and regret. Direction and production, down to camera work and lighting and soundtrack par excellence. Best TV series in a long time. Each of the six stories will stay with you for some time to come ...",/review/rw8055895/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2021,bazookamouth-221-898097,6," The award goes to Suranne Jones for Victoria
",Wow what an acting performance from Suranne Jones in Victoria from Season 2. My favorite episode was actually Kirsty (Samantha Morton). What I took from the seasons were just how brilliant the actresses were even if some stories were more interesting than others. Here I give me best to worst in programmes. (1) Kirsty - Samantha Morton. (2) Nicola - Vicky McClure. (3) Victoria - Suranne Jones. (4) Maria - Lesley Manville . (5) Hannah - Gemma Chan. (6) Danielle - Letitia Wright. Worth watching. Great series.,/review/rw8055895/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2022,bjarias,7," ... interesting-intriguing & confusing
","... hard to know how to feel regarding these six one-episode-stories... each well-acted and produced... liking all lead actors, yet there feels a bit missing over-all-episodes... rating by demographic numbers showing that women like them consistently more than men, and that makes sense seeing each of these women had creative input.. so does each episode reflect more of the creator or each of the six leads-stars",/review/rw8055895/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2021,Aladhruin,7," painful realism
","I love British drama exactly for what makes it what it is, the hardcore, in-your-face realism. But this!? Some episodes are like, socio-horror if there's such a genre. To the point where it's not enjoyable anymore; I did come very close to turning it off on at least two occasions, luckily there is some let-up in the end with some of them like in series 1 episode 2 there's a somewhat positive outcome. So, it achieves really well what it sets out to do, but do we really want to watch for entertainment what already goes on in real life?",/review/rw8055895/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2021,paul2001sw-1,6," Perceptive writing, limited format
","'I am' comprises two series of short dramas with female leads written by Dominic Savage; I've only seen the second of these. They're not badly written (indeed, in some ways, 'I am Maria' is superbly written (and acted, by Lesley Manville) but I didn't love the format. It tells us of the end of a marriage; while 'I am Victoria' tells of a woman breaking down under the pressure to be percieved as living her best life. But in both of these films, it felt like I was watching only the last chapter of a larger story; it was hard to place my sympathy when being shown only the final act. 'I am Danielle' is a more complete tale but in some ways quite schematic. I've seen many good movies that are only 80 minutes; but these films felt like snapshots more than they did narratives.",/review/rw8055895/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2021,EversonMovies,6," A must watch on channel 4
",A really good trilogy showing the lives of different characters and how they deal with different scenarios. All were a good watch but found Kirsty's story the most gripping. Shows how life can be changed so easily and gripping and sometimes uncomfortable to watch. Glad to hear there is a second series of these coming out.,/review/rw8055895/?ref_=tt_urv

29 April 2020,canddcleaver,10," Love is letting go.
","The acting in this amazing character study was supreme acting. worthy of the 10 stars as this is exactly what happens when a relationship can stupefy the person into thinking this is love. Love sure is letting go of control, emotional blackmailing . Hard watching but worth the effort of emotional carousel",/review/rw8055895/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2021,louie_ariza,8," I am... Slightly lacking
","I am... a well-off, straight, woman. There's variation in the writing, of course there is. The actors are all brilliant and they are all falling apart in different ways. The protrstyals are brilliant. But there is still a lack of variation and breadth with none of the characters being gay. Seems like a weird oversight.",/review/rw8055895/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2022,heidireveley-01001,3," A yawnfest
",The themes to this series are all the same. 5 dragging tales of needy whiney neurotic angst ridden females. The only one worth watching was I am Kirsty with the excellent Samantha Morton which at least had some kind of point/plot.,/review/rw8055895/?ref_=tt_urv
