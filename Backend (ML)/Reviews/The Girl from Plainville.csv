21 September 2021,lareval,9," Matilda Källström is here to stay
","A shockingly great series, one that came from nowhere and I was stucked and hooked throughout its eight-part storyline. Everything works wonderfully and the mix of languages (sweedish, french and english) and cultures are rich. The plot is way, way much better than expected and evolves into a deeper, engaging character arc that can be related to many real lives out there. Matilda Källström is a total revelations to me, I will keep posted on her from now on. Her talent must be discovered. Totally recommended!",/review/rw8736737/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2021,felixnkubi,10," was done really well
","I recently watched a show similar to this called Sex/Life, I hated it and found it really dumb but the way this show went about it was infinitely so much better! I was so invested from start to finish, and the acting was so raw, it felt so real... I so much hope for a season 2 but I doubt it, either way I would love to watch this actors again especially the two main leads.",/review/rw8736737/?ref_=tt_urv

31 August 2021,3m6882,10," It just felt too real...
","Wow I love how raw the plot is and the way the actors were able to evoke the emotions of hurt and regret as the plot thickens. It just felt too real, like I'm watching a real couple go through this rough situation in their relationship. Though it has an open ending, which I like, I still want to see how the story goes if ever there will be a season 2! Overall a great watch!!",/review/rw8736737/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2022,davek28,8," Well made
","This is one of those series about beautiful young people having relationship problems in the big city. I'd feel very lucky to have the same problems that they have. The central couple has been together for too long and is starting to drift apart so, when they have a spur of the moment threesome, it triggers feelings and doubts that have been festering for some time. She doesn't want to ask the question and he doesn't think there's anything to discuss as the threesome was by mutual consent.",/review/rw8736737/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2021,bjarias,8," ... really one most well done of its genre
",... acting in this series so-far has been exceptionally-good... yet what truly makes this programing unique is-writing-pacing... all-scenes everything's-feeling-real.. that's-rare... keep it all going in S2 & they'll-have-something-special,/review/rw8736737/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2021,dsdjbw,6," It's fun I guess!!
","The title and the premise gave an idea of a polyamorous relationship in the works.. but boy did it go down hill super fast. I loved Siri and David's Relationship the minute they came on to my screen and they had a threesome with Camille which by the way was Siri's Idea and then she spent the entire series blaming David for the encounter while having a whole ass relationship with someone she met on ""tinder"" . A 20something couple who were probably each other's first deciding to open up their relationship or even becoming a throuple, that's something I would rather watch than this sinking ship I just saw.",/review/rw8736737/?ref_=tt_urv

","I hate it so much lol . That ending didn't give it Justice . Poor David. Wtf ? I wish I never watched it, it's so good but I hate it . I feel for David's all over the world . We want a season 2 please. Dang.",/review/rw8736737/?ref_=tt_urv

","The whole things start with the main couple going to a bar. Than meeting up with someone, and from there going to party. As the night progress, the Girl Siri instigate a threesome. Her boyfriend While quite reluctant about it, he ends up going along with the idea.",/review/rw8736737/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2021,alexlindgren08,10," Portraying a scary reality many of us don't want to talk or think about
","The depth behind this story is easily missed if you haven't been in the same dilemma as its portraying. Being someone who haven't learned to stay on your own two feet, torn between the security of an almost Co dependent relationship, and on the other side being with someone who has developed their individuality and giving you the glimpse of what that is like.",/review/rw8736737/?ref_=tt_urv

",Show like more novel than tv show and cast is amazing.matilda and simon espcially such a amazing couple.its so sad because of the name so many peoples will ignore and will think like sex/life something rubbish but definitelly in same level with normal people even with small budget.,/review/rw8736737/?ref_=tt_urv

24 July 2022,kiolamika,3," Siri is a braindead character
","Siri is a very vile character. She gets her boyfriend to have a threesome with this random woman even though he wasn't into it at first. She then goes around blaming him for it. This I understand, maybe she was insecure and seeing your boyfriend of 7 years have sex with another woman can really bother you.",/review/rw8736737/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2022,aditya_ingole,10," Rated 10 due to it being underrated. But its an 8.
",The show is an unexpected find. The name of the show is misleading. Bad marketing perhaps? It's a very realistic drama between high school sweethearts who have been in a perfect relationship for 7 years. The relationship tumbles downward when they have a threesome at the girl's insistence (Siri) with Camille. The boy (David) though reluctant at first agrees to it. Siri regrets the threesome the next day. She refuses to talk about it and after some time begans blaming David for the whole thing even though it was mutual consent. She starts a relationship with another guy. David sensing something wrong ask her if she has been cheating which Siri vehemently denies and breaks off John. Things come to a screeching halt when at a party Siri sees John who she has feelings for but can't commit due to her still being in love with David. The series ends when David sees the texts from John confirming his worst fears.,/review/rw8736737/?ref_=tt_urv

4 September 2021,hanscarlsen-38475,4," Disappointing
","To exploit semi-naked young women and stripped young males does not make a good drama. The idea of monotoring young people exploring their sexuality is good and may shock some US watchers but is not the purpose? Still, the main characters are beautiful and quite charming.",/review/rw8736737/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2023,aztroxkai,9," Reality bites
","It will be so relatable to people who have experience the betrayal, confusion, complex relationships, especially to young couples. The story also shows the vulnerability of women and young men in relationships. But with strong commitment and foundation, it can be done but sadly the issue won't be forgotten.",/review/rw8736737/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2022,rnayman-24238,10," Moving and beautifully filmed
",This 8 episode drama series reflects the perils of unequal relationships and sheer lust. Siri decides to stick with the life she knew and was comfortable with at the end as David decides to ignore her unfaithfulness.,/review/rw8736737/?ref_=tt_urv
