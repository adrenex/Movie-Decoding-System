2 August 2021,TxMike,," A look at dementia from the opposite angle.
","This movie was shot in May 2019 just a few months before the COVID-19 pandemic was recognized. The writer-director says he wrote this with Anthony Hopkins, who was 81, in mind. The movie has a number of well established actors but the story's impact depends on Hopkins and he achieves this as very few might be able to do.",/review/rw6217792/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2021,classicsoncall,9," ""I don't know what's happening anymore.""
","This movie brings you inside the mind of someone losing their memories and recognition of those around them. In another genre, what happens here could just as well take place in a horror film. The fascinating thing about the story as it unfolds is that as the viewer, there comes a point where you begin to question whether what you're seeing is what the principal character is experiencing, or whether it's a figment of Anthony's (Anthony Hopkins) imagination. The distinction between his reality and the reveries that make up his daily existence sort of blend together in a way that confound the senses. Hopkins is extraordinary in the role, and if this is his last chance to earn an Oscar for Best Actor, then it's a darn good one in a field with some significant competition. Olivia Colman as Anthony's struggling daughter expresses all the concern and frustration that comes with being the primary caregiver for her dementia stricken father, and there are somber moments in the picture when you want to cry along with her over the hopelessness of both his and her situation. As a harbinger of what might happen to anyone as we all approach those senior twilight years, the film can be a depressing experience, only somewhat mitigated by the care and concern that dedicated health care workers are able to provide in an institutional setting. As tender and comforting as the closing scene is, it's one that will break the heart of anyone who's been through a similar experience.",/review/rw6217792/?ref_=tt_urv

4 April 2021,MOscarbradley,10," Hopkins has never been better.
","I haven't seen the play on which ""The Father"" is based, (or indeed the other two plays in Florian Zeller's trilogy on the family), but as cinematic adaptations go this is as good as it gets. Taking place almost entirely on a single set, this is an actor's piece of the highest order and its linchpin is a magnificent performance from Anthony Hopkins as ""The Father"" of the title, a man suffering from advanced dementia and perhaps, both in Hopkins's performance and Zeller's treatment of the subject, this will come to be seen as the definitive film on dementia as anyone with personal experience can testify.",/review/rw6217792/?ref_=tt_urv

3 April 2021,sinefilcinephile,10," Brilliant...
","Give Anthony Hopkins the Oscar on April 26. He gives you the best performance of the decade. An old man with dementia loses his ties to reality. His mind deteriorates, and reality stops making any sense. This movie will haunt you, especially if you have a relative with dementia. Such a heartbreaking movie. ABSOLUTELY the best movie of the year and the best performance of the year by Hopkins.",/review/rw6217792/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2021,deloudelouvain,8," Most realistic movie about dementia.
","The Father couldn't be more realistic when talking about Alzheimer's disease. I've seen my grandfather walking that path. He was a smart man but once the dementia kicked in he was barely recognizable, which was a hard thing to witness when you knew him as the intellectual he was. The Father just nailed this subject, bringing back so many memories, memories we would rather forget but that you can't. Living with a loved one with this disease isn't easy at all, certainly not when that person sometimes doesn't remember who you are. I didn't knew Anthony Hopkins won an Oscar for his role, but after watching this movie I can only say it's highly deserved. It's probably one of his better performances ever, and that at 83 years old. The Father isn't a movie that will give you a lot of joy, it's sad and scary but certainly worth watching. Nobody wants to have a loved one suffering from dementia, it's a nightmare to live with. I remember my grandfather starting to smoke a cigarette like it was a thing he always did and that whilst he stopped more than forty years ago. I remember him telling me he was going crazy after asking me the same question for the twentieth time in barely an hour. He knew it was all going downhill, he knew he was a burden to everybody, and that must hurt when you are still that little bit lucid to understand that. I watched several movies about dementia but this one is just the most realistic. It's sad but that's life, everybody should watch it so they can be prepared if the disease ever would hit a loved one.",/review/rw6217792/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2022,searchanddestroy-1,8," Fascinating and sad, but painful and tense.
","This is the kind of movie that may feel you uncomfortable, it is disturbing but that will make you stuck to the screen. It shows the kind of situation that may concern millions of us, now or in the future, or also in the past, about one of our relatives. Of course Anthony Hopkins gives a more than brilliant performance and the most unusual is to lead the audience in some kind of a maze, the audience who can have the feeling to be tricked. Anyway, I warn some audiences against this beautiful and powerful stage movie, some audiences who could have a father or mother suffering of Alzheimer disease. It could be very painful to watch. But there were many other movies speaking of this. However this one has something special, I have not yet found excatly what. I derseves to be seen again. And again, especially if you lose memory....",/review/rw6217792/?ref_=tt_urv

4 April 2021,isaacsundaralingam,10," Probably the only movie I've seen that discusses aging and dementia in any meaningful capacity
","One of my all time favorite movies is Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York which narrates the ever deteriorating world around a playwright bordering on reality and insanity. And Florian Zeller's The Father is the closest I've seen that captures the insanity of the decaying mind, but told through the apparatus of a very real and universal issue.",/review/rw6217792/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2021,Cineanalyst,8," Demented Puzzle
","Dementia is a terrible disease. It's not something I'm interested in seeing depicted on screen. I've already seen enough of that. ""Amour"" (2012), with it likewise being claustrophobically isolated to an apartment and although it involves a stroke, especially comes to mind. Anticipating it was a depressingly realistic slice-of-life drama, I wasn't enthusiastic about seeing this Awards-winner, ""The Father,"" from a playwright turned first-time movie director. Fortunately and surprisingly, I don't think it's that, and one would be well advised to see it before reading reviews for it, including this one. I'm not familiar with the writer-director's original play that this is an Anglicization of, ""Le PÃ¨re,"" nor the French film already made of it, ""Floride"" (2015), so I don't know how much of it was always of design or if anything is original here. I mean, ""they don't even speak English there."" Regardless, that ""The Father"" may come across as what I feared it was--and what others seem to discuss it as--is because we may forget genres when introduced to their entries in unpredictable ways. But, remember, ""The Father"" is a mind-game film, a puzzle picture.",/review/rw6217792/?ref_=tt_urv

18 July 2021,julieshotmail,10," Anthony Hopkins at the top of his game at 82
","This movie is mind-blowing. Not only does it give you the perspective of a mind that has devolved into dementia, it creatively immerses you in their moment-to-moment thoughts and experiences through the repeating confusing scenes, changing context, strange faces, disappearing furniture, etc. Now who could convincingly portray an old man who has lost his mind through an acting performance that showcases the opposite of dementia? None other than Sir Anthony Hopkins! Here, we have this veteran actor at 82 years old who could very well be a victim of dementia himself at that ripe old age. Instead, he is firing at all cylinders, giving us this heartwarming performance of a lifetime making us convinced that he really has dementia, but the act of doing so just proves he is at the top of his game with elite-level acting. Who would've thought that after 30 years of his legendary Hannibal Lecter, he would top himself with this one? I look forward to more Anthony Hopkins films to come!",/review/rw6217792/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2022,kosmasp,10," The daughter and the (holy) confusion
","I remember that there was a bit of an outrage - not about the movie itself, but about the Academy Award Anthony Hopkins was given too. Some felt that Chadwick Bosman was meant to get it. Chadwick Bosman surely deserved an Oscar - but the outrage was way too late and not really helping anyone. Chadwick would have deserved an Oscar for his performance in the ""Get up"" movie (his James Brown personification was ... just awesome and spot on), but everyone who was against the decision, must not have seen the Father. Because Anthony Hopkins is just so good in it, there is no doubt he deserved this Oscar he got.",/review/rw6217792/?ref_=tt_urv
