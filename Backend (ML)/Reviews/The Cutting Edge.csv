7 February 2020,jburtonprod-802-759029,3," The Most Dishonest Movie Adaptation Based on True Events. Ever.
","This movie isn't a bad watch. It's entertaining and has good acting. The problem is it is based on real events surrounding a convicted murderer, his super-rich friends/partners and their Ponzi scheme. Almost everything about crimes has been changed to make the two main characters more sympathetic.",/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," Great acting, poor writing.
","The entire cast performed exceptionally well, but the poor writing and major plot issues made this film miss the mark. The directing was decent but also need better editing. Still an enjoyable film based on true events, but could have been much better. It's a 7/10 from me",/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2018,SnoopyStyle,3," a real grind to watch
","It's 1983 L.A. While hustling cars to a rich client, Dean Karny (Taron Egerton) runs into former classmate Joe Hunt (Ansel Elgort). Neither were in the inner circle of the privileged set in the private L.A. Harvard School for Boys. Dean is the schmoozer and Joe is the poor scholarship outsider. Joe is a struggling analyst promoting his gold scheme to his superiors and Dean suggests starting their own company BBC. Dean introduces Joe to corrupt trader Ron Levin (Kevin Spacey). Through lies and gumption, Joe is able to recruit their rich former classmates and they recruit their rich fathers. Soon they are operating a multi-million dollar Ponzie scheme. Joe falls for Sydney Evans (Emma Roberts). It's a dog eat dog world and it all comes crashing down.",/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv

",This story tells two young men who enters the upper class world and become ultra rich through dubious means.,/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2018,aldiboronti,5," Nothing special but it is enjoyable
","This is based on a real-life case and was made before as a TV movie in the 80s with Judd Nelson starring. This has higher production values and can boast Kevin Spacey in the cast, although boast may be the wrong word these days. Still whatever else may be said of him he's a great actor and I always enjoy seeing him.",/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2018,tkaine3,6," Good movie but very reminiscent of other films
",This movie doesn't take long to kick into gear and has a pretty fast pace. The acting is good and the music is retro pop giving you that late 80's early 90's fun disco vibe. But the movie is based on a true story and that adds to the storylines authenticity but young guys starting a investment firm and getting in over their heads is a story too commonly told. This story does however go further on the tragedy scale then other movies about broker's or investors but when you watch these films that cover this topic it's always like watching a slow train wreck and this feature is no different. I do think this movie has some entertainment value but just a little. ,/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2019,eileen-guthrie555,3," If it sounds to good to be true, it probably is...
","I've read every book written about Joe ""Gamsky"" Hunt, Ron Levin and the Billionaire Boys Club. I cannot believe this movie is portraying the character of Joe Hunt as clueless and sympathetic, when he deserves neither. There wasn't much difference between Joe Hunt and Ron Levin as they were both con men running a Ponzi scheme, only Levin used Joe and the BBC to pull off his scheme against another man who had invested his money in Levin's investment account. It was the same thing he did when he invested $5 million into the BBC that was contingent on using Levin's investment account at Clayton Brokerage Company, where he controlled the money. They make Dean Karney the bad guy in this version, when he was just a pawn in Hunt's scheme.",/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2018,formationlc,3," Shameful remake
","Here is another take on the story of Joe Hunt (Joseph Gamsky) by Hollywood screenwriter airheads who think they can do whatever they fancy about a story and turn it into something completely different with no regards to the truth. I even wonder if the writers took time to read Sue Horton's book (The Billionaire Boys Club) and who worked for years to get all the right details to render the story as close to reality as it was possible.. Did they even see the first version of the movie made in 1987 which is based faithfully on that book? (The movie starred Judd Nelson who played Joe Hunt in a most magnificient way ) (Strange thing actually that Mr. Nelson accepted a part in this parody of the story).This movie shows Joe Hunt as an unsure young man, one who does not have a strong personality and therefore who can barely influence anyone, much less in investing huge sums of money. The movie shows Joe Gamsky as a victim and Dean Karny being ""the brain"" behind everything when actually it was the other way around. ",/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2018,krismancini,6," Enjoyable one-time watch. Also worth it for Spacey.
","Enjoyable one-time watch, for young people especially. It deals with important questions like how far do you bend your ethics to make a dollar?",/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2018,boardy-55103,6," The real story would have been much more interesting
","Not a bad movie. 
Acceptable acting, directing.
And even the writing was ok.
IF .. And it's a big IF.
IF the true story wasn't already so dam interesting. 
The basically fictionalized account of what actually happened is soooooo far from the truth. 
Find the documentary on YouTube if you want the truth.",/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2018,Prof68,5," Well....
","From what I remember of the whole incident this is telling the story from a way different perspective. Hunt, in this case, is a sympathetic character which is a complete 180 from what happened in real life. The real Hunt was something of a borderline sociopath and, here, he's portrayed as a socially inept wannabe who gets swept up in events not of his making.",/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2018,janetbhughesx,4," True story gone false
","The first TV mini-series was so much better. This version has some (maybe even most) of the facts right, but leaves so much out and paints Joe Hunt as a poor guy who just lost his way among the ultra rich Beverly Hills boys club. In reality he is a con man and a murderer, who had a to do list that ran six pages on how to kill Ron Levin, who was himself a con man.",/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv

","An interesting story well told. Shows the business world in all of it's grimy glory. Performances are good and overall if you think you might like it, you probably will!",/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2020,muamba_eats_toast,8," Don't get the hate
",Thought the film whilst imperfect was extremely entertaining I completely understand the dislike of Spacey as a person but as a film this was really enjoyable fast paced and full of twists couldn't complain at all.,/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2019,jql_longhurst,10," Ignore the rating. A great movie
",When I saw the rating I almost didn't watch it. A brilliant re-enactment of a true story with superb casting and authentic performances. Totally under-rated,/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2018,letsgamble92,3," The Wolf of Wall Street... nooot
","Wooden dialogues which actors feel uncomfortable playing. Pace is too fast -main character overnight turn from miserable to Steve Jobs. You dont realize they've got rich, when they already broke. What is more, pyramid scheme which made them rich, is shown in least interesting possible way. High expectactions, turned down.
BTW. the scene where Kevin tells wealthies kids that their lifes will change in this moment... who wrote that?",/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2018,akcenat,5," Hollow and generic B-movie with a lot of hype surrounding it
","Billionaire Boys Club, a remake of the 1987 TV movie of the same name, is story about a group of old schoolmates in LA who create a Ponzi scheme that quickly spirals out of control. BBC is, also, Kevin Spacey first film appearance since allegations of misconduct arose last fall (2017). Despite his and rest of the cast - ""Baby Driver"" Ansel Elgort and ""Kingsman"" Taron Egerton - appearance film is pretty much a generic rise-and-fall true-story biographical drama that does nothing to elevate itself among a sea of similar looking films. Its characters are either stock or nonexistent as the dialogue is un-engaging and flat. The interesting story was there. The right actors were there. However, director (James Cox) fell short of creating the right atmosphere for the film to work. For BBC, The Wolf of Wall Street is like gold, compared to brass. 5-/10",/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2020,mmccrady,10," Exceeded expectations
",I was hesitant to watch this thinking it was some wannabe big time film. It went beyond my expectations. Definitely worth watching.,/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2019,JoBloTheMovieCritic,4," Billionaire Boys Club
","4/10 - incredible cast of some of my favorite young actors (Ansel Elgort, Emma Roberts, Taron Egerton), but the story falls short of expectations",/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2018,chrismonkee,3," Awful
","Like amateur dramatics, or at best a poor TV movie. I gave up a third of the way through, and I like Kevin Spacey as well. Was prepared to ignore his indescretions and come with an open mind.",/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2018,angelsunchained,8," Spacey is finished
","Just heard this film made one hundred and twenty five dollars in ticket sales this weekend. The bad publicity surrounding Kevin Spacey has destroyed his box office appeal and his career. He gives a solid performance, but the critics and most of the public clearly are no longer interested. Decent film with some good performances and entertaining enough. However, it is clearly flopping at the box office and Mr.Spacey will be lucky to ever work in a first run film again.",/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2018,gutierrezfrankli,1," really not recommending this movie
","Everything in this movie was really bad, should've been called ""joe and dean,"" or something else. There are members of the BBC and we don't know what their roles in the BBC or the movie. The original BBC is more informative. Here we have a bunch of kids doing drugs and partying. Ron Levin (Kevin Spacey) is a caricature, they did not care about the character. My advice to you is to watch the 1987 BBC with Judd Nelson, he is more charismatic, more edgy than Ansel Elgort Character.",/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2018,cokeeffee,4," I got bored...
",This is a pretty poor film. The narrative is quite confused and the characters are uniformly dull and pretty cliched. Not a patch on films like margin call and boiler room.,/review/rw4266845/?ref_=tt_urv
