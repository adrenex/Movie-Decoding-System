28 October 2022,benjaminskylerhill,6," Incredibly creative but way overstuffed.
","Henry Selick's welcome return to direction is expectedly visually splendorous. Though a lot more rudimentary in it's appearance than Coraline, Wendell & Wild is brimming with life in the design of every one of its memorable characters and sets.",/review/rw8644816/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2022,liammarklh,3," A Stop Motion Marvel but a Narrative Mess
","Right off the bat I want to say that the stop motion animation is simply gorgeous, and the characters move fluidly in each scene they are in. The creepy factor, the wild demon designs, dank atmosphere of the girl's school and town as well as the grim reality of corporatization all make this film stylish, and while it's super cliche, I would say it had good intentions, but fumbled halfway through.",/review/rw8644816/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,colbertadrian,5," Underwhelming
","The idea of Key&Peele as stop-motion characters was enough to draw me in, the problem with the movie is they're not the main characters even though the title says Wendell & Wild, the main character is the school girl Kat, and because her life's trauma left her cold, she hard to like, the animation has high production value, it looks good, but the story is about too many different things, and the title characters fade into the background, Kat is supposed to be some kind of hell something lol, and her mentor played by Angela Bassett has the same powers but it's not fleshed out enough to understand what the purpose of those powers are, overall a cute Halloween movie for a family to watch, parents turn off your brain and let the kids enjoy the animation.",/review/rw8644816/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," Walk on the (Wendell &) Wild side.
","'Wendell & Wild (2022)' is adaptation of Henry Selick's own book about a troubled girl who meets her demons shortly after being enrolled at an all-girls catholic school in her home town. It's the director's first film since his much-loved classic, 'Coraline (2009)', and it features many of the hallmarks of his delightfully macabre style. Teaming up with Jordan Peele (who takes on co-writing, producing and acting as the titular Wild) seems like a match made in heaven - or, perhaps, hell - and a lot of the movie lives up to that potential. However, ultimately it's one of the weaker entries in either filmmakers' filmographies because it simply can't get a handle on what it wants to be. Straight away, something seems off with the pacing. The editing is very elliptical, even in the most straight-forward sequences, and the overarching structure is very unfocused. The piece bounces around between its various elements, never quite coming together as a cohesive whole. These elements are mostly excellent in isolation, but the fact that they never quite gel leads to an experience that's difficult to get fully immersed in. The flick deals with a lot of interesting ideas, touching on themes of family and guilt while commenting on important societal issues such as the prison-industrial complex, and it's also awash in positive representation (even though I could have done without the deadnaming of one of its characters). It's a bit heavy-handed, sure, but it mostly works and actively enhances the narrative. It's a shame that these subtextual, and even textual, aspects get a bit lost in the overall muddled nature of the affair. There are, I suppose, too many for any one of them to be fully fleshed out, leading to moments in which certain things pop up and affect the plot - despite never having been set-up properly - and then fizzle away just as quickly as they appeared. Despite its issues, though, the film is enjoyable throughout. Its aesthetic is distinct and and appealing, with its fluid animation combining with its colourful characters to bring its gleefully grotesque world to life. It has a tangible vibe to it, which is one of its most valuable assets. Regardless of how messy its story is, it's undeniably entertaining, and it conveys several good messages that are as expected as they are necessary. It often deals with familiar elements in an unfamiliar way, at its best when playing with its more subversive scenarios. The picture is a solid effort, even though it certainly has a few narrative issues. If it were more focused, it could have been great. Still, it's a good time overall.",/review/rw8644816/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2022,JayWolfgramm,6," With this Amount of Talent We Should get Better
","When I first saw the trailer, I was really excited for this movie. Henry Selick has made two all-time animated classics with ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Coraline"". Having him team up with Jordan Peele, sounds like a match made in heaven. Ironic comparison given the subject of the movie.",/review/rw8644816/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2022,CinemaClown,," Messy Structure & Muddled Storytelling Brings It Down
","From the director of The Nightmare Before Christmas & Coraline, Wendell & Wild is yet another stop-motion animation offering that brims with originality, creativity & imagination and packs a thematically-rich premise overflowing with ideas but the film as a whole still required more fine-tuning with the script, for the messy structure & muddled storytelling only brings the ride down.",/review/rw8644816/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2022,AWHerrenburger,4," A Visual feast, and nothing more...
",Stop motion is such a time consuming endeavor. It makes it all the more painful when the plot doesn't live up to the visuals.,/review/rw8644816/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,basmamatti,5," Gorgeous animation... Unsatisfactory plot.
",The animation is actually stunning. I found myself being throughly engaged just from the animation alone. The representation was also refreshing.,/review/rw8644816/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2022,apersonwatchesmovies,," Halloween disappointment
","Very little charm, not scary or creepy, and lacking any heart. This was wholly disappointing. I had trouble connecting with any of the characters, although I tried my best to! Kat, the movie's protagonist and an orphan, should've been SO much more sympathetic than she was. Even the titular characters Wendall & Wild were pretty one-dimensional.",/review/rw8644816/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,cabrown-47741,4," Stop Motion lacks script and story to entertain adults as well as children.
","Wendell and Wild, once again demonstrates the skill of Henry Selick's Stop Motion animation skills. But without out the foundation of Burton's imagination and the wonderful film score of Danny Elfman, this film lacks heart and humor. The collaboration of Selick and Jordan Peele created a seriously mediocre story which stumbles through a clumsy, storyline with mostly shallow characters, in typical bizarre Selick settings. This is a very adult story, which follows the politics of a small town overtaken by evil corporation wanting to privatize a prison system. Add in an almost demonic Catholic Girls school, Demonic underworld, and you have a clumsy story that doesn't merit the stop motion format. It's unfortunate that Netflix doesn't exercise more power in story development. Because it's obvious, that Selicks skill as a director, does not match his writing and producing skills.",/review/rw8644816/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2022,DrReverb,4," I wanted to like it
","The best parts of the movie are the art-style, animation, and Wendell & Wild themselves. They are easily the most interesting and entertaining characters (and Manberg). Kat on the other hand, is the most negative and spiteful main character I've seen. While I understand the trauma she went through, she never shows an ounce of sympathy to anyone except her parents. There's nothing likable about her.",/review/rw8644816/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2022,FeastMode,3," Ambitious but brought down by its Netflix-ness
","I heard beforehand that Wendell & Wild uses a new stop-motion animation technique. As I started the movie, I second-guessed if that was true. I thought maybe they used it a little but it was mostly CG. After seeing how much stop-motion they used, I am super impressed. It looks like MISSIONS to do all of it.",/review/rw8644816/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2022,seanparkerfilms,8," A spooky, sumptuous, somewhat messy delight.
","Henry Sellick's first stop-motion animated film since 2009's beloved Coraline, Wendell & Wild melds beautiful artistry and a very funny script co-written by Jordan Peele.",/review/rw8644816/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2022,xixliesent,4," Who is this for?
",This movie doesn't seem to be for young kids... it's too nonsensical to be for adults. I guess maybe teens? But I don't think they'd watch it.,/review/rw8644816/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2022,RebelPanda,6," Ambitious miss-fire
","Beautiful production design and elegantly scored attempt at emulating classic animated horror for audiences of all ages. Although it mostly succeeds on an audiovisual front, the story is exhaustingly overstuffed, leaving the characters flat and underdeveloped. Ambitiously, it squeezes a dozen progressive ideas it can into 100 minutes, failing to develop them enough to craft insightful commentary or funny satire. There's a point at which including progressive themes can come off as pandering rather than sincere representation, Wendell & Wild wavers. There are so few surprises or conflicts that can't be easily predicted. If the film had compelling characters it'd be enough to get by, but as is we barely know anything about them. Before we have a reason to care about people they're gone and a new character is introduced. Although the voice acting is superb, it doesn't help that most of them are annoyingly one underdeveloped.",/review/rw8644816/?ref_=tt_urv

","I had been waiting for this movie since the first trailer. I was super excited since the names associated were brilliant. Unfortunately, it wasn't the film for me.

28 October 2022,IonicBreezeMachine,7," Henry Selick, Jordan Peele, and Keegan-Michael Key team up to deliver some wonderfully bizarre stop-motion weirdness
","Set in the town of Rust Bank, troubled teenager Kat Elliot (Lyric Ross) is enrolled in Rust Bank Catholic (RBC) after she's deemed a candidate for a special program that enlists juvenile offenders in private schools. Since the death of her parents in the town some years back, Kat has hardened herself against any attachments and maintains an abrasive exterior preventing anyone from getting close to her. Meanwhile in the underworld, two demon brothers, Wendell (Keegan Michael-Key) and Wild (Jordan Peele) are stuck with the menial job of replanting their father's, Buffalo Belzer (Ving Rhames), hair following his discover of the duo's Dream Faire plans.

10 November 2022,asodehmagner,2," What was the point?
",This should've been interesting...but it wasn't in the slightest. With the celeb names that were thrown into this movie and the quirkiness it promised I had expected much more. I think some of these writers and producers need to be reminded just your name isn't good enough to captivate viewers when the story isn't worth spending our time on.,/review/rw8644816/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,NocturneAeros,10," So, so smart!
