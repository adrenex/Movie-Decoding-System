","Puss in Boots returns with the help of three kittens to rescue a precious ruby from the evil Whisperer. Whisperer whispers too mutely but what an adventure we have! Yes, Puss in Boots always gets better and better. Hats off to Raman Hui, he gas directed the best short animation ever seen. I have been seeing this every month! I think those 3 little kittens are adorable and it was really funny for a short movie for instance, when the kittens beat Puss, that part was totally hilarious! My nephews enjoyed it so much that they wanted it to be a feature film. Hope we get a sequel for a short film also! Now, I am drooling for Puss in Boots 2. Anyway... HAPPY 2ND(DVD RELEASE) ANNIVERSARY!",/review/rw8815861/?ref_=tt_urv

","These 13 minutes tell us the story of what happened to Puss in Boots after his first feature film. The princess asks him to recover a stolen ruby from an evil sorcerer. But before he can do that he has to tame a trio of wild kittens. (He may have been just like them a couple years ago.) Of course, after some initial struggling, that is exactly what he does and the kittens help him in fighting the evil wizard. Director Raman Hui worked on several ""Shrek"" film and also on ""Puss in Boots"", not as a director as he does here, but still he had some impact and finally got his own film, even if it's not that long. We'll see how his upcoming film ""Monster Hunt"" turns out. Writer Tom Wheeler also came up with the script for the original ""Puss in Boots"" and Antonio Banderas is also back of course. The rest of the cast are not known to me. I just saw that there will be a second feature movie maybe in 3 years from now and people who enjoyed the first will certainly be curious. These are also the ones that should give ""The Three Diablos"" a watch. Nothing outstanding, but a decent little short.",/review/rw8815861/?ref_=tt_urv

",Puss in Boots:The Three Diablos is a 2012 CGI short. These days a successful cartoon film will lead to sequels and spin-offs as well as animated shorts which tend to be DVD extras.,/review/rw8815861/?ref_=tt_urv

","Kind of interesting how much ""Puss in Boots: The Three Diablos"" managed to do in just 13 minutes. This short animated movie with the lovable Puss in Boots character is actually enjoyable - albeit quite short.",/review/rw8815861/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2012,Vincentiu,," heart of crown
","nice. and this is a virtue. charming. and this is really admirable. short. and its is the best fact. a story and its new page. a character who becomes a kind of father. an adventure and a silly queen, four cats and moral lesson. a small joke and part of new adventures of brave Puss in Boots. sure, nothing original. but it is not a problem. the hero must be fresh. he is not only a hero or a renegade. he has noble feelings and precise sword. he is romantic, gentle and protective. he is king and few princes are a very good ingredient. and beginning for new form of adventures. a heart of crown - this is this short film in which honey of sentimental Puss and image of new generation, after a seductive friend is essence of a interesting product.",/review/rw8815861/?ref_=tt_urv

","The best joke in 'Puss In Boots: The Three Diablos (2012)' is arguably far too brief and could've been mined for more laughs, but in a way it's good that the short doesn't overdo any of its aspects. This is an entertaining outing from the moment it begins. The story pairs the feline protagonist with a trio of naughty but cute kitties, tasking him with taking care of the unruly youth as they lead him to a stolen treasure. It has a quick pace that skips over some fairly important character development, but the broad strokes are all there and the arcs are generally satisfying. It features a few chuckles here and there, and its aesthetic isn't too much of a downgrade from the feature film it acts as a spin-off from. It's an enjoyable effort overall, even if its narrative is a little undercooked.",/review/rw8815861/?ref_=tt_urv
