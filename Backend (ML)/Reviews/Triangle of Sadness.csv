2 February 2005,Smells_Like_Cheese,," Despite some very unrealistic situations, this is a very good show
","""Boy Meets World"", I grew up with this show. I will always admit without a doubt that this show made me laugh and cry. It dealt with real issues like sex, first days of high school and college, drugs, not fitting in, etc. Most of the problems that go into a normal teenager's life. As the show grew more and more, Erik's character changed drastically. He went from just a smooth talking womanizer to a retarded heart warmer. Mr. Feeny, it seemed like he followed these 3 students everywhere they went. Like in the last episode even Shawn says ""You haven't talked to another student in 7 years!"" Great line, because it was so true. But I would never turn down this show because it does have great laughs. Every season brings something special to it. I would recommend removing the flaws and you find a great show.",/review/rw2916816/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2005,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,10," a very fun show
","Boy Meets World is a show that reminds me a lot of NBC's 'Friends,' except for teens and younger children. Ben Savage leads the show as the character Cory Matthews. BMW shows the hardships of life from a young kid, a teen, a young adult, and finally, an adult. The show does a great job of adding humor in a lot of aspects of the show. As Cory goes on, you can see that he is maturing with time. I grew up with Cory, and he shows how hard it can be. The show does a good job of developing Cory, giving him the girl of his dreams, a loyal friend, a caring family, and a teacher/principal who has always been at his side. The show has everything that makes a good sitcom, comedy, drama, romance, and the occasional deep trouble that every teen gets in. BMW ended 5 years ago, but it is still one of the most watched shows on TV on the Disney Channel and ABC Family.",/review/rw2916816/?ref_=tt_urv

16 April 2001,Elysia,," Moving and inspirational tales of adolescence
","Sometimes the lessons we learn about life when we are growing up are forgotten when we become adults; this show helps to remind us of what we learned.  It is a bit campy, but that is half of the fun of the show.  The characters are people that we all knew at some point in our lives, but the bond that they share is not something that we can all say that we have.  If you are searching for 30 minutes of campy fun, and a chance to look back on your adolescence then this is the show for you.",/review/rw2916816/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2002,fourzan,," Hooked on Boy Meets World
","As a 43 year-old, English teacher, I must admit ""Boy Meets World"" has some of the most intricate scripts I have ever seen in teenage shows.  I sometimes ask my students to view the day's episode at home and come back ready to discuss theme, plot, character, etc.  Some students admit to liking the show after a few viewings.  Once they understand each character and the force that drives him/her, the show pretty much seems to flow and attract the students.",/review/rw2916816/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2004,wondercheese,," This show was for us all, and we loved it!
","This show was great! it was heartfelt and made us feel good about ourselves. This show took us back to our youth. When we were the boys meeting the world. When we were facing life and wondered how the world would put us in a situation that was ironically impossible. This show took the impossible situation and turned it into the fun we had if we had thought about the ""OH YEAH!"" factor before hand. This show was for us all. It made us feel good about ourselves and our remembrance of our youth. This show was for us all, and we loved it! This show is one that will live on after its cancellation. our children will watch it and our children will love it. Admit it, who didn't shed a tear when it was over?",/review/rw2916816/?ref_=tt_urv

23 May 2014,jackbanister16,7," They didn't know when to call it quits.
","""Boy Meets World"" is a great show! Unfortunately they went the ""Saved by the Bell,"" route and detailed ""the college years."" The first couple seasons of ""BMW"" are lightning in a bottle. It's funny, charming, clever, AND you get your moral lesson of the day with each episode. The series was character driven and it was very entertaining! You had the relatable Cory Matthews, a class clown type who at the end of the day was a good kid. Sean Hunter, the ladies man kid with family problems, and Topanga Lawrence, who was just an oddball. Supporting cast included Cory's family, his brother Eric (a suave ladies man), and Mr. Feenie, a tough but fair teacher who also doubles as Cory's neighbor. The writing combined with these quirky characters really made for a funny show. The scenarios were hilarious and heartwarming without being overly ambitious. The show knew its shortcomings (some gaping plot holes and missing characters.) In my opinion, the show was good until the senior year of high school which is when the show shifted its paradigm from fun adventures and mishaps of high school kids to being a mushy show all about ""feelings."" Don't get me wrong, there were still plenty of mishaps and fun scenarios, but the show became way too dramatic.",/review/rw2916816/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2017,taylorhammons,10," The show that defined a generation
","Boy Meets World is unlike any children's show ever made, or any show for that matter. In an era where every show has to have an angle, Boy Meets World stands out as a story about flawed characters just trying to navigate life. It teaches us so many lessons and I will never forget it as long as I live. Shawn taught us that we can all overcome whatever life deals us, and that you can never judge a book by its cover. Topanga taught us that it's OK not to be perfect, but we can all try. Cory taught us that it's OK to ask questions, to not have all the answers. And Mr. Feeny, well, he taught us everything. He taught us that, above all, we should be good people. He taught us that there are lessons to be learned in all aspects of our lives. Boy Meets World was a great show because of the parents. Corys parents make just as many mistakes as he does, and they're not afraid to admit when they do. But that's not to say that their children don't respect them, don't come to them for advice, and don't always know what's best. Never has a show made me laugh and cry so much. Never has a show so effortlessly addressed the problems we all face. Never has a show been a better demonstration that you don't have to be blood to be family. Full of good values, lessons, and funny plots, Boy Meets World is the show that I keep coming back to. Because never has a show meant so much to me. Never has a show meant so much to us. We will never forget you, Boy Meets World. You made us all better people.",/review/rw2916816/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2005,avigayilklein,," The best show on Disney Channel!!!
","I don't know why, but for some reason, Disney is getting rid of their best shows and putting in new ones that are pointless to watch (ie: ""Brandy and Mr. Whiskers""). But ""Boy Meets World"" is one of the good ones, unfortunately being pushed off to a later and later time.",/review/rw2916816/?ref_=tt_urv

",This show was the Disney Channel Show that the Magic Kingdom didn't originate. Boy Meets World was one of the bigger hits that ABC TV had during the Nineties for family audience. The Kingdom soon remedied that and it was run on their network in syndication and later Disney put out the current Girl Meets World about the next generation of the Matthews family.,/review/rw2916816/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2020,d-38363,9," ScreenRant says it's the most overrated show. Even compare to Full House? Not a little bit.
","There's some hokey dialogue some times. Some filler or cringey 90's moments. The show doesn't feel that rewarding or special to watch with some not so special kind of style in Season 1 to 2. Most of the episodes felt safe or searching for rare gem moments. Morgan was also annoying until they somewhat unexpectingly replaced the actor with another Morgan, but older. The only thing I remembered that other Morgan said booger. Shawn was at times the typical stupid goofball we know and watch. Despite all of that. I'm glad I watched this show, despite the unfunny dialogue that can be distracting at times. I will say it's not that bad. At least 60% of the time you will get a laugh or smile and even a hard laugh at times. The messages and themes of the episodes are really incredible for a simple kids show. I know this show has a lot of music playing in the messages to make it easier to feel something. I do think if you get rid of the music, it still would take some emotion from me anyways because I feel the importance of them each time no matter how simple or important. The characters no matter how dull they can be at times, they are solid characters for what this show is going for. Obviously Feeny and Shawn are the two best characters of this show and the other characters aren't so low to the scale at all. They still hold the show together and still are a joy to watch. This show gets better after season 2, but you can still see some good episodes in the earlier seasons. Overall, there's a lot I didn't go over that will give you a better understanding on what I witnessed through this show. However, I still am glad I can show you as much great things this show has. To be honest I would enjoy this show a lot more if I actually watched the full series when I was younger. Didn't even finished season 1 for some reason, but I regret it. However, I can't figure out what's waste and what's worth my time unless you look back. I don't regret my childhood because I still got to see the gem no matter how old I am right now. So, is it dated? Sure. Could I give this show a realistic rating? Sure. Do I think this show deserves a 10 for actually trying to be a good shower of life. Of course. Even when they get older it's like the are still young inside and they don't try to be hardcore edgy, but just deal with realistic problems that they go through when they feel one thing or a change happens to them. Even though this show is meant for kids around elementary, middle, or even high school. I feel like even as a young adult or no matter what age you are, it's like you need to at least watch the show in order to have a good life. I know that sounds really silly because I also believe if you hold on to something without letting it go, what reward will you get from something that attaches to yourself where it controls your life big or small? Even though I believe nothing should be pleasured over in this world. I feel like this show can be the only thing I need to really give me the comfort and figuring myself out phase that I would need to hold onto even though I know I don't need it. Also the ending was so joyful but also sad, even though you do see them in Girl Meets World and know they are doing fine in the show. It's not one of the best shows of all time. It's one of the most important shows of all time.",/review/rw2916816/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2006,NoName1989,8," Very good! Funny, moving, emotional,...
","I liked ""Boy Meets World"" very much. When I started watching it, I didn't like it so much. The first season, when Cory was still a little kid I didn't like so much. But when he grows older, ""Boy Meets World"" gets better. You see how Cory (the main character) and his best friend Shawn live their lives, how they deal with problems typical for their age, how they behave, their relation with their teacher Mr. Feeny. This is a very good series that is at some moments very funny, at some moments very moving. This is a series that will certainly touch your heart. The acting is very good, and the music is very good, especially combined with the emotional scenes! Some episodes are excellent, some may be a bit less, but in general this is an excellent series that I recommend to everyone!",/review/rw2916816/?ref_=tt_urv

12 August 2021,metsfandave86,8," A Modern Day Leave It to Beaver
","I remember this show from my youth, now my family are watching entire series on Disney Plus. This show does a lot of things right. It chronicles the life of youngster Cory Matthews and how he handles growing up from elementary through college years. His group includes his family. His mom and dad raising 3 children always have the right answer for Cory and their other kids. His best friend Shawn Hunter who lives a troubled life is fighting his own deamons, however the two friends would do literally anything for the other. Cory does find himself in trouble from time to time, but he has a teacher/principal Mr. Feeny who pours love and discipline into him, Mr. Feeny becomes one of the biggest influences in Mr. Matthews life. Then there is Topenga. They have been friends for a very long time. They eventually become high school sweethearts and write one of the greatest tv sitcom romances ever. This is a really good show that can get goofy at times, but they handle teen issues with dignity and care. One of the things that make this show so fun is the number of actors that made appearances on this show. Too many to mention, but it is fun when they show up on the screen.",/review/rw2916816/?ref_=tt_urv

","""BOY MEETS WORLD,"" is my opinion, is a pure ABC hit! I can't recall every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always funny when a mishap occurred at school. I always laugh at that. As a matter of fact, I think just about every single one of Mr. Feeny's (William Daniels) lines was funny. It would have been nice if Lily Nicksay had played Morgan on the show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope they bring it back on the air for fans of the show to see.",/review/rw2916816/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2005,departed07,," Interesting the first couple of seasons, but lack towards the end
","That's an interesting title, isn't it? I grew up watching Boy Meets World on ABC's TGIF knowing that someday I would understand what that title means, and I do realize what those words mean. The show takes on everyday life as a boy in Philadelphia name Cory Matthews (Ben Savage) goes through what every boy faces in their life: getting to know the world. His parents (William Russ and Betsy Randle) are just like any other parents, understanding. His older brother Eric (Will Friedel) is a pain of the butt in which throughout episodes he will act like a goof ball or a cool brother who understands what Cory is going through; his best friend Shawn Hunter (Rider Strong) is a troublemaker in whom he gets Cory into his little mischief plans; his girlfriend's name is Topanga Lawrence (Danielle Fisher) who is into getting grades and staying out of trouble and what is worse than a brother, a mischief friend or a girlfriend who doesn't butt out of people's business: having the principal of your school living next door to you. That's right, Cory's principal Mr. George Feeny (William Daniels), is his next door neighbor in which like Wilson on ""Home Improvement"" he is always there to give advice and the students a lesson. I liked the show's first couple of seasons, but after that I was disturbed when as the kids got older, the show became more like ""Saved by the Bell"" where the main characters when to the same high school and the same college where even Feeny taught at both education systems. Though Belding didn't do it. Another thing that bother me on the show is when Cory bother Shawn and Eric about going to college. Hear me out, its great going to college, but leave people alone Cory.",/review/rw2916816/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2015,davispittman,10," Absolutely brilliant show!!
","Boy meets world (1993-2000) is just an excellent TV show! The show gives me such a good/warm feeling EVERY time I sit down and watch it! It really features great acting by amazing characters! Cory and Topanga really are well constructed characters that have fantastic chemistry together. And Shawn is a very well written character as well. The ladies and gay guys will most likely love him LOL. He really is a ladies man in the later seasons, when they reach teenage years. And Cory and Topanga's romance really lasts throughout the show and is so sweet to watch their ups and downs. The lines of dialogue in the show are so well written! It goes from very serious drama to laugh out loud hilarious. And Mr. Feeney is another very funny and also wise character. The show would not be the same without Feeney! It's also for the most part family friendly, in the college aged seasons it's not quite as family friendly, but it's really nothing too risqué. This is a show I think you and your whole family could love to watch! 10/10 for boy meets world!",/review/rw2916816/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2013,AsifZamir,10," Almost every episode shares an important life lesson
","Boy Meets World is an enjoyable family television sitcom that is about the journey of adolescence into manhood. Because of that theme, pretty much everyone can enjoy this show. Cory Matthews is best friends with Shawn Hunter and the sitcom starts out with the two in sixth grade and go all the way to when they are happily married. It's rare for shows to last as long as this did and so a lot of people grew up watching this. These two young boys really don't care so much about schoolwork and they just want to experience life. The series brings out Cory's friendship with Topanga who have known each other since they were little and are destined to be together. The series follows this group right into college and even marriage for Cory and Topanga. What I like about Boy Meets World is most episodes have a life lesson, a moral value. There is a clear right and wrong message which is missing from today's shows. For you parents, I would recommend you turn off your child's facebook for a while and make them watch this show from start to finish. I highly recommend this sitcom as it is a relaxing enjoyable and enriching television show. You'll really miss it after you've seen every episode. - Asif Zamir",/review/rw2916816/?ref_=tt_urv
