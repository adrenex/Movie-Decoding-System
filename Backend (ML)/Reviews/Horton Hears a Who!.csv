18 March 2001,moonspinner55,9," Quirky is not a dirty word...
","...yet this eccentric comedy never quite found its niche with the public, and I don't know why. It's beautifully produced and written, wonderfully acted and endlessly weird (how many films can you say that about?). When sad-sack Tom Hanks decides to give up his life for a few days of luxury, we understand because his existence may be a lot like ours: glum office job with lime walls, dirty floors, unpleasant co-workers, bad coffee and fluorescent lights on the fritz. When he's out to sea, floating on his luggage, he sees shapes in the sky at night that light up his face; he may be in a precarious position, stranded on the ocean, but he's the happiest and most alive he's ever been. What a wonderful moment in a movie chock-full of smart, sneaky laugh lines and throwaway bits of business that stay with one, growing beloved in the memory. Screenwriter John Patrick Shanley, also making his directorial debut, has a fine sense of pacing and a keen eye for the absurd beauty in our midst. Only in the final reel does the construction of the plot stumble, however this is due to film studio interference. ***1/2 from ****",/review/rw6387930/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2001,drosse67,," My All Time Favorite
","Like many others who have commented, this movie speaks to me on many different levels.  Whenever my life gets out of control, this is the movie I plug in.  Joe is a character we can all identify with, and everyone has a bit of DeeDee, Anjelica and Patricia in them as well. I just wish Warner Bros. would release this on DVD (and the soundtrack, while they're at it).  By far the best Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan movie.  I just can't believe the low ""grade"" of this movie on IMD after reading mostly positive comments.  And the few who hate it should give it another chance, and pay no attention to the silly previews that exist on some older videotapes.",/review/rw6387930/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2005,5860backup,8," One of my all time favorites
","I am one of the few who saw this on the big screen TWICE when it opened. This is the movie I would take to the desert island, which miraculously has electricity a big screen and a DVD player. This is one of those rare films where every single character, no matter how minor, has a major impact on the hero and the plot. This film is also rare because the Lion's share of the funny and insightful dialogue belongs to the minor characters and not the protagonists. You have to love a movie where a luggage salesman is a major plot milestone. Ossie Davis is excellent as the wise Limo driver, Lloyd Bridges is hilarious, Tom Hanks is of course everyman, and Meg Ryan, in one of her funniest roles, is actually ""every woman"". ""You know, the first time I saw you I thought that I had seen you before."" A witty hero is commonplace and witty cast is truly memorable.",/review/rw6387930/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 1999,Mr. E-2,," An Under-appreciated Delight
","For many people, the fact that I love this movie will throw the integrity of everything else I write about into doubt.  ""Joe"" has unfairly become an industry joke, shorthand for the depths to which Tom Hanks sank before redeeming himself with Academy Awards.  This fate is horribly undeserved. ""Joe"" is an imaginative and gloriously life-affirming movie, a hysterically funny fantasy nearly on a par with the best of Terry Gilliam with a ""carpe diem"" moral that comes across with a lot more honesty and a lot less preachiness than some other movies I could mention.  Every Tom Hanks performance is virtually flawless and this one ranks near the top.  Meg Ryan's performances are warm and hilarious.  Usually it's men who play more than one role in a movie and then it's more often for ego's sake than art's. Ryan pulls off her multiple characters with remarkable grace.  More amazingly, it makes perfect sense for her to play three characters.  For the sake of argument, I am willing to concede that there are those who just aren't going to enjoy this movie's unique mixture of whimsy and genuine emotion.  But for me, it's a classic, easily one of my favorite movies of the decade.",/review/rw6387930/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2004,ChrisDickerson,10," One of the most overlooked movies ever
","In complete seriousness, I can say ""Joe Versus The Volcano"" is one of the best movies ever to come out of Hollywood. Sadly, it's also one of the most overlooked movies ever made. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan both are absolutely fantastic in this movie that really is an allegory about life. The movie has a fantastic script, is directed beautifully and stands up to the test of time. Hanks is at his comedic best as the soul-sick Joe, and Ryan is fantastic in her three roles. Why this movie didn't do better (despite a lack of promotion) is beyond me. It is one seems like one of those word-of-mouth movies that just keep getting bigger. I saw it three times in the theater, watched it numerous times on video and purchased the DVD the day it came out. But it's OK, I know a hidden gem when I see it.",/review/rw6387930/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2010,napierslogs,7," Intelligent and inventively funny film, but also just plain weird
","For lack of better words, ""Joe Versus the Volcano"" is a romantic comedy. But then again, it's not even close to a romantic comedy. It has none of the formulaic standard elements that all romantic comedies seem to have. It has none of the formulaic standard elements of fantasy films. It also doesn't seem to have much of the slow, dry aspects of character dramas. And yet, ""Joe Versus the Volcano"" is a comedic film about Joe who finds romance, mostly set in a fantasy world.",/review/rw6387930/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2019,pmtelefon,10," Top Five of All Time.
","Is that an overstatement? No. ""Joe Versus the Volcano"" consistently moves me in ways few movies ever have. It is a beautifully told story with a great message. This movie is so good that the two or three clunker jokes are easily forgiven. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are very good but it's Ossie Davis and Lloyd Bridges that steal the show acting-wise. They both deliver knock-out performances. ""Joe Versus the Volcano"" also has terrific music. One great song after another. This movie is great stuff all around. (I saw this movie when it first came at the Westbury, NY Drive In.)",/review/rw6387930/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,ebeckstr-1,7," Underappreciated and misunderstood
","Highlights of this underrated film include witty, dark humor, with many laugh out loud moments and performances; moments of unexpected poignancy; and an equally unexpected reflective quality. Starring and supporting acting is brilliant and, at times, even subtle, which contributes to more character development than usual for this kind of movie. The plot wavers about an hour in, becoming too silly for a time. During this same chunk the script includes some unfortunate '90s style stereotyping of native people and cultures, and what is actually quite a shocking and cavalier conclusion to this segment of the movie. The final 10 minutes recaptures the tone and sentiment from the first part of the movie and brings the story to a fitting conclusion and simultaneously doing justice to the characters.",/review/rw6387930/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 1999,UACW,," Agree with previous comments
","This is about near-death experiences. They teach you something - about the immediacy of life. About forgetting the rat race and enjoying. It all becomes clear when you've been ""on the edge"". When things appear in stark contrasts. When there is only black and white - light and dark. To see the sun shining though a window. To gaze upon a loved one and just watch them breathe. I have seen this movie over 1,000 times and it still feeds my soul.",/review/rw6387930/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 1998,jcosper,10," A sweet, wonderful romantic movie!
","It starts dark and dismal. It has to. The lower it starts, the higher the climax at the end when Joe is able to release his fears and live life to the fullest. A man is told he's dying of a ""brain cloud"" and has 6 months to live. Suddenly a stranger offers him a deal: live like a king for a month, die jumping into a volcano. With nothing to lose, he sets out for a tiny island. Along the way he discovers how wonderful life is. Not even a shipwreck can bring down his spirits. The ending is terrifically happy. The music is great. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are just as wonderful here as in Sleepless in Seattle. Abe Vigoda rocks. Watch for Nathan Lane as one of the islanders. But the ultimate scene stealer is the luggage salesman. All in all, a sweet, wonderful romantic movie.",/review/rw6387930/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2002,scipioUofR,," Surprisingly Good, Unfortunately overlooked
","Tom Hanks has made many movies, most of which are very funny, emotional, and heartwarming. This movies is different from all his other movies: it is a work of art. Every scene has its own idiosyncrasies. Ordinary characters and settings have subtle emotional undertones that tug at the heartstrings. Dan Hedaya and Sam Waterstone's performances, though humorous, have a tone that is more than the sum of its parts. Color and scenery also have a hidden beauty, such as in the scene with Joe's glowing warm in his cold, blue office, or the scene with the dog and child as he exits the doctor's office, or the scene with him all alone at his table at the hotel. I first saw the movie when I was 11 years old, even then, its beauty struck me. That beauty was well capped off by the montage during the end credits. Apparently, John Patrick Shanley, or someone, put alot of work in an otherwise ordinary movie. Imagine if Stanley Kuprick had directed ""You've Got mail."" I'm surprised that the movie is not better known, especially that it is a big turning point in Tom Hanks career. Admittedly, his screen presence compensates for Meg Ryan's lackluster acting at times. She was best as a brunette and redhead than acting as herself. Nevertheless, a good movie, one to own and not just rent.",/review/rw6387930/?ref_=tt_urv

10 May 2008,ccthemovieman-1,8," A Nice, Uplifiting Film
","Consistently horrible reviews made me reluctant to watch this over a decade ago but when I did, I thought it was pretty good. I actually enjoyed it for the most part. Of course, I usually enjoy films starring Tom Hanks. However, I almost always hate every film Meg Ryan is in, so it balances out.",/review/rw6387930/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 1999,Caryn-2,," Combines a life-affirming message with ""in-jokes"" for movie lovers.
","This is my favorite film for a number of reasons.  One reason is that it includes _homages_ to many classic films.  For instance, the very first shot of the factory immediately brings to mind Chaplin's _Modern Times_ and Lang's _Metropolis_.  The first minutes of the film, until Joe is called into the doctor's office, are filmed almost in black and white.  The tones are all grey, black, or taupe, with some glaring whites.  Then the door to the doctor's office opens to show warm leather, paneling, and firelight, and it's a sudden reminder of _The Wizard of Oz_, when Dorothy opens the door into Oz and the movie changes from black and white to color.",/review/rw6387930/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2004,Sandman138,10," Without a doubt one of the greatest movies ever made.
","I am a very tough critic, and most movies are nothing but incredible disappointments for me. However, Joe vs. the Volcano is a movie that I can honestly say is a cinematic masterpiece. When people call this a romantic comedy, they are committing a great injustice to this film. That is not to say that there is not romantic comedy in the story, but to say that it is the point of the film is monumentally short sighted. The real story in Joe vs. the Volcano is about coming to terms with yourself, finding that spark that we spend our lives searching for. It is about discovering our humanity and what that entails. Normally, this would end up being pretentious and sophomoric crap, but because the heavy subject matter is taken so lightly, we are treated to a modern fairy tale that runs the gamut in terms of emotional impact. The performances are stellar and to this day I have never enjoyed Tom Hanks more, the direction pays tribute to classic films with cinephillic glee, and the soundtrack is simply superb. 10 out of 10!",/review/rw6387930/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2004,cj-scrivener,10," A misunderstood film explained
","Most people didn't ""get"" this film. But each of us has a different sense of humour and depth. JVTV is a subtle, witty film with morals, not like the bash 'em and blow 'em up Hollywood films of late. Meg Ryan shows her versatility as three separate, wonderfully funny characters and Tom Hanks (think of his character in The Money Pit but amusingly depressed) as Joe Banks trapped in a dead end job and is told he has a terminal illness. He is offered the chance to ""live like a king, die like a man"" by jumping into a volcano as part of a business deal where Joe gets to spend as much money as he likes before the big deed. Along the way Joe meets many characters who awaken him to the fact that life is worth living. This film is loaded with wonderful observations, a great score and songs, and standout performances. JVTV is one of those rare films you can easily watch again and again, and always makes me smile every time I see it.",/review/rw6387930/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2001,TxMike,," Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan shine in an otherwise silly movie.
","SPOILERS -- Hanks is a down-and-out office worker for a medical devices company. Lousy boss (Dan Hedaya), lousy working conditions, muddy parking lot, poor lighting, Joe always feels ""bad.""  We would probably diagnose it as depression, but Joe is told he has a ""brain cloud"" and only a short time to live. Suspiciously coincidentally, a wealthy businessman shows up to make him a great proposition - an all-expenses cruise to a tropical island, all he has to do is agree to jump into the volcano for the required sacrifice. After all, he's going to die anyway so why not go out with a bit of enjoyment and excitement?",/review/rw6387930/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've never understood why this movie wasn't more popular. I just don't get it- great acting by Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan (in three very different roles), Ossie Davis and Dan Hedaya, among others. Terrific, quirky direction and an excellent script. This movie is just so much fun to watch. It should have been hailed as an instant classic. ",/review/rw6387930/?ref_=tt_urv

","JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO (1990) *** Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Lloyd Bridges, Dan Hedaya, Ossie Davis, Robert Stack, Abe Vigoda, Amanda Plummer.  John Patrick Shanley wrote and made his directorial debut in this screwball comedy about doomed Hanks making a journey to a tropical island to be a volcano sacrifice and winds up falling in love with Ryan (in three humdinger roles) along the way.

12 December 1998,daver-4,10," Romantic, witty, smart and deep.
","The first and best of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan's films together.  On the surface, a romantic screwball comedy about a guy hired to jump into a volcano to save an island tribe, but at the core of this wonderful movie (a 10 in my opinion) is the story of two complicated people who fall in love, while doing some major soul searching.  Hanks' character is a sad hypochondriac who becomes happy, charismatic and impulsive AFTER being diagnosed with a terminal disease (""brain cloud"").  He becomes involved with three quirky women (all played by Ryan, who uses her three acting styles with the characters--airhead, snobby and adorable) before making ""the leap.""  Never dreary in tone (despite the premise), the movie is a deep, beautiful fairy tale for audiences (young and old) who like to think.",/review/rw6387930/?ref_=tt_urv
