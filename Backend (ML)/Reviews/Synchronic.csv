23 March 2020,MR-ODIN,," I very much enjoyed this movie
","WOW, Pixar is really moving onward with creativity and originality. While the story itself and plotting may suffer a few issues like predictibility at times, amazing animation and stunning visuals, along with beautifully designed characters and great chemistry beetween actors who voiced those characters perfectly, make this movie great, enjoyable and worth watching. The way they've used a mixture of real life elements and fantasy elements from Dungeons and Dragons universe is also great and worth mentioning. While, at first look it doesn't feel like a Pixar movie, the more time you spend watching it, you will get all feelings and heart you expect from your average Pixar movie. Dan Scanlon did a great job this time.",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2021,TheLittleSongbird,9," A bond of two brothers
","The premise for 'Onward' is a good one if not unique. Pixar have more creative concepts than the one here, such as 'Inside Out', 'Soul' and 'Coco'. Pixar has not been as consistent in the 2010s compared to before, more though when it comes to its sequels and prequels. The studio was very consistently high quality up to 'Toy Story 3' and has varied since that film in my view. 'Onward' is one of two, and the first, of their films released in 2020, the other being 'Soul'.",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2020,rodriguezarturo1,8," Made me appreciate my brother
","This movie is pretty fast paced. The characters are always trying to get out of some kind of mess they created, so in other words you're never bored. I recommend you watch this film with your siblings. I'm a grown man and this film had me tearing up lol. Another great film by Pixar.",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2020,z-knipp,9," Hate it but not cause it is bad.
",I hated this movie because it hit me so hard. Lost my dad a while back and never dealt with all the things from that but this movie kinda drop kicked my feelings into the focus. Hard to watch a film with tears streaming down your face,/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv

","A great film about siblings and the incredible bond they can share. I enjoyed every second, don't listen to the haters.",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2020,brigid134,9," Great film that doesn't have issues of other films
","The dead parent trope might be overused for Disney movies but Onward doesn't make the mistakes of those movies. The siblings fight like siblings though out, not just at plot critical moments. Their single mom has a boyfriend who is not an evil stepparent trope, and their mom is actually proactive during the events of the film, but the adventure still belongs to the boys. I've been tired of plots that have parents oblivious to what their kids are doing. I came for the DnD references but I cried for the well-rounded characters.",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2020,alffastar-261-288715,10," Movie for boys where the price is love - bravo Pixar
","Doing a fulfilling movie for boys where the price of the quest is emotional wholeness and found love is a rare sight and not an easy task. Pixar succeeded by providing rich brotherly relationship, adventure, magic and finally love. It is much more a common message in movies for girls like Frozen, but I think that the magical combination of all the ingredients achieved by Pixar is important and entertaining at the same time. Wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone :)",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2021,questl-18592,9," Detentions and Dragons
","My second time watching this and I find myself only liking it more. At this point, the expectations for a Disney/Pixar venture are going to default to high and somehow they always seem to impress. Obviously, animation is gorgeous, it's hilarious, heartfelt and takes place in a magical world. I love this take on a world of magic that evolved out of whimsy for the sake of modern conveniences. The whole idea is fun to me and the film fully delivers on it throughout.",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2020,snow-lover-biblio-0711,10," Extremely underrated emotional road trip - Onward
","This movie will give you laughs as well as leave you in sobs. Fun, action-packed and emotional, it's a great watch.",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2020,Alexander_Blanchett,8," Magical and emotional
","Really beautiful and emotional movie. It won me primarily over by its absolutely fantastic and very detailed animations, look and use of colors.
Truely magical. It had so much time to develope so many different characters even if its just little extras. I would actually watch a TV series based on the lives of those fantasy characters in the suburbans. A very creative idea to actually tell a very simple and common story. The film convinced me because it just touched the right buttons and activated them with the story structure and the relationship between the two leading characters. There is some great voice work, most noteable Tom Holland and Octavia Spencer but also Chris Pratt meets the right tone.
One of the best Pixar movies that came out the last years and one of the most creative and magical ones (more in design than story) for a very long time. It got me close to tears at the end and that means something for a animated film. Kudos to Pixar, they know how to bring magic back t the cinema.",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2021,thekarmicnomad,8," Good fun with chance of misty eyes
","I didn't like the look of this, the animation, the content or the story.
I am glad I decided to watch it.",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2020,loginibisheart,9," Age doesn't matter, watch this movie!
","It's a fantastic movie! It might fall into cliches but that's what the movie is all about. It brings the sense of epic to the viewer and engage with their feelings. It's well balanced, as the movie emphasizes in the adventure aspect of it but without forgetting comic times as well as really touchy moments were you'll for sure be moved. It's a great movies that will introduce you to some aspects of role playing in a way you probably haven't thought before. Great for both kids and adults.",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2020,UniqueParticle,8," Awesome adventures experience
","Very heartwarming blast of glorious adventures and spells! Glad I got to see an advance screening today, it was nice to see adults by themselves and kids. Had several epic parts along some sad stuff too. Onward is delightful especially Chris Pratt I love his character! I highly recommend this cool well done kids movie to anyone when it's actually out. I have Asperger's syndrome can you guys chill with the dislikes!",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2020,masonsaul,8," Great adventure
","Onward isn't one of Pixar's best but its still a great fantasy adventure about rediscovering magic that's fun, funny and emotional. Tom Holland and Chris Pratt are both incredible and have perfect chemistry. Octavia Spencer and Julia Louis-Dreryfus are both great. As usual the animation is incredible and consistently stunning. The music by Mychael Danna is really good and Dan Scanlon's direction is great.",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2020,danielcosimona,10," Honestly, Pixar is making better movies than Disney
","I can't believe it. The best animated movie of the year was not by Disney. And it's not a surprise because most of the movies Disney did in 2019 were sequels and remakes (and Star Wars, and Avengers Endgame, which wasn't as good as Avengers: Infinity Wars). This is one of the most creative movies I've ever watched! Sure, it's cliche, however it's got a good moral, a good story, good character development, its humor isn't just in one character (contrary to Frozen II), and it is visually beautiful. This is the best animated movie of the year, and I really hope Disney makes more movies like this.",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2020,paul_haakonsen,9," This was spectacular...
","When I sat down to watch ""Onward"" with my 10 year old son, I had no idea what I was in for here, except for it being an animated movie. I had definitely not expected it to turn out to be one of the most entertaining and enjoyable animated movies I have ever seen.",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2020,seaverchen,10," Pixar is amazing
",The ending was enchanting. Just the fact that he gave up his only chance to see his father to give it to his brother! WOW. That hit hard.,/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2020,planktonrules,7," Good...not great.
","""Onward"" is a beautiful film to watch, and so as usual a Pixar film is among the best looking CGI movies you can find. I especially love the look of the twilight scenes. This being said, the story itself is only okay...and the big finale is a bit of a letdown.",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2020,warren-87235,6," Entertaining but Forced
","I'm seeing a pattern with PIXAR movies now. Increasingly, the movies feel less about thinking up an interesting story, and more about picking some tear-jerking moment and then attempting to build a story around them.",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2021,pritol,7," Great fun, but not the magic of other Pixar films!
","This is a great film by any stretch! Really fun magical world of elves, centaurs, mermaids and all that jazz, but with a modern suburban setting. The film has some laugh out loud moments and the animation is as always spectacular.",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2021,Cineanalyst,5," Indifferent
","""Onward"" is the first Pixar feature that I don't care about. It's so thoroughly uninteresting that it provokes no strong feelings. It's neither as astounding as the studio's best hits since ""Toy Story"" (1995) revolutionized computer animation, nor as deserving of derision as something so atrociously derivative as, say, ""Monsters University"" (2013).",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2020,cardsrock,8," Even lesser Pixar still manages to dazzle
","I would place Onward in the middle of the pack in Pixar's filmography, which means it is a quality animated film but not quite on the level of the studio's best. The story is a fun, modern spin on the classic quest adventure and has plenty of good laughs throughout. It feels a little like a DreamWorks animation for a bit, but it manages to showcase some of Pixar's trademark heart near the end. The theme of having a parental figure is a good one and Onward explores it in a meaningful, heartfelt way.",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2020,ironhorse_iv,8," This enchanting motion picture is truly magically. It's worth seeing. Onward!
","This contemporary fantasy about two elf brothers Ian (Voiced by Tom Holland) & Barley Lightfoot (Voiced by Chris Pratt) on their quest to find a resurrection gem that will bring back their departed love one home for one day was majestic & spellbinding! Those are the words that best describe the first non-sequel flick produced by Pixar for Disney since 2017 animation feature 'Coco'. Much like that holiday picture directed by Lee Unkrich, this movie also dealt with the themes of love and loss in a similar way. However, the film written and directed by Dan Scanlon doesn't reach the high levels of tear jerking emotional from most of Pixar's previous movies due to the absence of establishing who the demise father really was even with the powerful scene with the tape recording. Don't get me wrong, the film is still moving, but just think how much more powerful the movie could had been if they add surrounding characters POV musical perspective flashbacks of him rather than hard to connection sign language gesture with footsteps of the silence man trying to emote feelings. The film could also had put a little more pressure into the race against time concept with the father slowly disappearing due to the spell not being completed. It would had made the quest more compelling. Another problem with the movie is that the world building. It's not quite as rich and epic as it had. Don't get me wrong, the urban fantasy is done better here than films like 2017 'Bright'. However, it does lean too heavily on clichés modern day society tropes and archetypes. For example, their society has cars that looks like it was built for humanoids when the world is made out majority of creatures that isn't that shape. It kinda bug me. Another is how similar the technological innovation of their world match ours. Rather than phones, I wish they had advanced scientifically crystal balls or cauldron like machines. Lots of unique miss opportunities here. It's especially disappointing when you compare this settling to their past works like 2006's 'Cars' and more recent Walt Disney animation movies world building locations like 2016's 'Zootopia' & 2014's 'Big Hero Six'. Look, I get that the world of 'Onward' abandoned magic but the idea that science and inventing is a lot easier to learn than mystics is jarring when Ian figure out a lot of spells in the course of one day. Then there is the idea that many of the residents are unaware of their species basic abilities. For example, if the pixies don't use their wings much due to technology, wouldn't evolution take those abilities away seeing how science exist in this world? Also, even if they could use them; it takes creatures several weeks to learn to fly even in life or death situation. As for the treasure hunt; there is several problems with the logistic of it. First off, I can understand how the two can find their way back home after going to Raven's Point. After all, they didn't really start their adventure until reaching the tavern at a different location. So, they had to travel further miles in the complete opposite direction to find the enigmatic foundation which they didn't know they could have skip. What I don't get is how they reach their own city in time; seeing how they walk the last third to Raven's Point & then took a slow boat ride back to town. It does not match with the many hours they spent driving to the point in their van the first time. Unless, ships made out of food in this world move in supersonic speeds which I highly doubt. To add onto that, the clichés third act in which one of the members abandoned the mission only to return is really overdone. There is no way they can reunited on time. Nor would any of the supporting characters and their magic sword join them as they wouldn't have that knowledge of the fountain location as well. Furthermore, the establishment of the quest is not well explained. Who hid the phoenix gem in the first place and created a trap filled dungeon? Also how did the father gain access to the first gem? It's seems unlikely that a very ill elf went to a similar journey to find one. The repetitive narrative opening and climax doesn't really help, because of that the story is very inconsistent even with the film's strong use of foreshadowing. Regardless, I did like humor and nods to the board game Dungeons & Dragons and company time as a subsidiary of Chuck E. Cheese. It was funny. As for the acting. The two leads were decent even if their characters can be a bit annoying at times. Yet, their performance just doesn't stand out as much due to how similar their roles in this film when compare to the characters, they played in the Marvel movies. Nevertheless, the supporting cast was also pretty good. As for the animation. Even with the Guinevere controversial, I still find the movie stunning. However, I really do believe that Pixar has stolen another artist's unicorn themed mural. After all, the artist has a good case as the company rented her vehicle for a festival. They look nearly alike. The film also featured the first post-20th Century Fox acquisition. The Simpsons animated short 'Playdate with Destiny' that played before the feature film was fine. Still it was weird to heard that this movie & it's short was banned in the middle east due to an off end improvised line about a lesbian couple. Nevertheless, unfortunately, you can't watch 'Onward' no longer in the theaters because of the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the company made the unprecedented move of making the film available for digital download on Disney Plus. Even with the service many flaws. The movie is worth checking out on there. So, grab a second breakfast and seek this out.",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2020,garethcrook,6," Not Pixar's best, but the bar is really high.
","So the final film of the year is another Pixar outing. I don't think there's any that I've missed now, but this one slipped by at the beginning of the year. Time was when this wouldn't have happened, I'd be dragged to the cinema with the kids on opening weekend. The kids are growing up though and the cinemas are closed. We're in a world of mythical creatures including Ian (Tom Holland) who's a elf (not the Christmas kind). He's turning 16, missing his dad who's passed away. Generally dealing with the stresses of being a teenager, being awkward, be embarrassed by his older brother Barley (Chris Pratt). Barley believes in a magic that over time has been forgotten. Their dad believed though and now both kids are 16, left a way for him to return for a single day. Things get off to a bad start when they only manage to bring back his legs and have to set off on a quest for another gemstone to finish the job. I don't really do fairytale stuff, but this works... just about. It's pretty straight up adventure stuff with plenty of laughs and the usual journey of self discovery. It looks great, the lighting is lovely and it makes full use of the fantasy theme by dialling the colours all the way up. I'm not sure I'd want to watch it again, but it had me laughing and blubbering in all the right places.",/review/rw6731455/?ref_=tt_urv
