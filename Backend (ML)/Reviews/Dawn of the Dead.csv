11 November 2006,Tony43,," Well intentioned miss
","First, let me offer a personal note. I was at the Ambassador Hotel the night Senator Robert F. Kennedy was shot, although I had to leave the hotel to perform my own job as a wire service journalist before the Senator came down to the ballroom, so I was not there after midnight when the shooting took place. However, my wife at the time was there and for one moment, was one of those standing over Kennedy's body. I was back at the office working on the Kennedy victory story when word came though of the shooting. It was devastating, even more so for me because we learned very quickly that a woman was among those shot, but there were no ids available and in the days before cell phones, I had no way to reach my wife. It was hours before she was able to get to a pay phone to call me and let me know she was alright.",/review/rw1540805/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2007,gradyharp,8," Stories of racism, infidelity, aging, the effects of the Vietnam War, drugs: Why RFK's death was so impactful
","BOBBY as written and directed (and starring) Emilio Estevez is not simply a recreation of the fateful night June 6, 1968 when Bobby Kennedy was shot, though that event is meticulously dissected as the sun dawns on Los Angeles' Ambassador Hotel on that day. This film is a series of vignettes of the lives of many people (22 examples shine) whose hope for a better future than that of a country undergoing disintegration on many levels were shattered. It is about 'little people', people with choices whose responses to the death of a hero is devastating.",/review/rw1540805/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was NOT ever a Kennedy supporter. Not back then. Now, 50 years + later, how I wish these men had been given the opportunity to carry out their terms and change America to include all our people and begin to really build America. I would vote for them today! What their father did to build the family fortune was back in the 30's! Who cares! I think his sons wanted to give back to America. (not so abiding with Teddy. His lack of judgment at Chappaq was unforgivable)I just think it is UNthinkable that JFK MX MLK & RFK were ALL assassinated back in the 60's. That is about as ugly a chapter that America has ever shown to the world, outside of the Civil War! It is so perplexing to comprehend this happening in America.",/review/rw1540805/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Bobby"" which tells the story of the assassination of Robert Kennedy, the little brother of the late and also assassinated President John F. Kennedy, and what was going on 16 hours before it happened. We are thrown back and forth between 22 extraordinary characters and stories. Emilio Estevez writes, directs, and co-stars; he has truly elevated his level of direction and writing. This is coming from the same man who brought us hit and miss films like ""Men at Work"" and ""The War at Home."" He parallels us through a journey of injustice, racism, prejudice, adultery, and more. This film much like ""Crash"" with its unsubtle undertones of encroachment could be the multi-character film that has the ""Good Night, and Good Luck feel that speaks assertively to America.

27 November 2006,blanbrn,9," Truly uplifting. Will bring sadness to your eyes.
","Over the weekend I went to see ""Bobby"" with much excitement and anticipation, and I must say I wasn't disappointed. ""Bobby"" is a real winner a truly uplifting film that will have your spirit and soul touched. Being a history and culture fan, I just love movies that take us back in time to capture real events as they had happened, along with taking a look at the times of the particular year and how the culture shapes people's way of life. Emilio Estevez really does a heck of a job here both writing and directing he captures the mood and culture of 1968 so well. 1968 a time of war with plenty of discontent, and the new rebellious age of drugs and groupies is well shown and dissected in ""Bobby"" along with the lives of people eager for a new direction just sucks you into this film. However this film has a political concept but tries to stay away from hard core politics, as it focuses more on the lives of characters that cross one another, and all of them have problems and they all follow one another right to a climax of tragedy at the L.A. Ambassador hotel on that unforgettable night in 1968. These people are all wanting and seeking change and they feel that this candidate Robert F. Kennedy will give it to them, he will represent hope for everyone. You see a broad selection of characters seeking change in this film from hotel managers, stage divas, minorities, a hair dresser and even a young lady who marries her young love to keep him from going to war, to just plain people searching for love and compassion. ""Bobby"" also features an all-star cast Heather Graham, Anthony Hopkins, Helen Hunt, Lindsay Lohan, William H. Macy, Sharon Stone and Demi Moore who all give emotional and brilliant performances. ""Bobby"" is a film you will enjoy and feel uplifted with emotion only to suffer an emotional sadness as you see dreams of hope shattered among a group of people representing the times of 1968. ""Bobby"" is a real winner, and emotional history culture gem.",/review/rw1540805/?ref_=tt_urv

21 November 2006,maxleigh,10," A life changing movie
","This movie has the power to change the world, if people take a moment to think about it. The theater was packed, and all left silent, most very emotional. The message that Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King were giving is no longer being said by our current leaders, and that is a very sad thing. The work they were doing should not have fallen by the wayside when they were assassinated, but it seems that it has. The current message we are getting is quite the opposite. Massive kudos to Emilio Estevez for giving us this message again through his movie. The acting was amazing, the writing perfect, and the direction was incredible. What I took from this movie is that we should all take the time to really think about who we're putting in power and what they will do with that power. Take the time to vote. Without your vote as your voice, you have no power to give. As RFK said ""Few will have the greatness to bend history; but each of us can work to change a small portion of events...Each time a man stands up for an ideal...he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.""",/review/rw1540805/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2006,nlw820,9," Admirable, moving effort
","It's easy to get caught up in the ""too many characters"" argument or that there are too many stories left unfinished or incomplete. IMO, it's important to remember this is a snapshot of just ONE day. How much are we expected to know about any of the characters in that time period? How much do you learn about the guy sitting next to you on the plane with whom you visit during a three hour flight? I admit that at first I was thinking, ""Okay Emilio, where are you going with this and why do I care about all these people?"" It seemed a little disjointed to me. But then I found myself going with it and appreciating the idea that we were getting a glimpse into the lives of a few of the people at the Ambassador hotel that day. I thought the performances by all were very strong, although I'll admit it was next to impossible to get beyond the all-star cast, simply because the plot isn't structured to bring you close enough to the characters to lose sight of who is playing the role. But again, in the end it didn't matter because the artistry of it all--the music, the camera shots, the inclusion of film and audio footage of Bobby Kennedy, the significance of these characters we've been following throughout... it just worked for me. It is also hard to ignore how much RFK's message resonates in our political climate today. As the credits rolled, at least half of the audience remained in their seats, from those sitting in stunned silence to others almost sobbing. Complete strangers were gathered outside the theater, talking about the movie or their own memories of Kennedy. It is clearly a labor of love for Emilio but I think he did a fabulous job.",/review/rw1540805/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2008,gus120970,5," Tedious hagiographic ensemble piece
","What is it about L.A and ensemble films? The Player, Short Cuts, Crash...Emilio Estevez makes a ham-fisted attempt to fashion a memoriam to the ill-fated brother of JFK using the multi-strand plot and character technique associated with Robert Altman. But Estevez clearly lacks Altman's ability to maintain interest and build character through the use of trivialities, revelations and encounters as the film progresses.",/review/rw1540805/?ref_=tt_urv

28 November 2006,Boyo-2,10," Its really great, critical responses notwithstanding
","The first thing I have to address is the amount of extraordinarily horrible reviews I've read for this movie in the print press. Usually I can understand why a movie takes a beating. More often than not, the reviews are justified and even if I see the movie and I disagree, I can objectively see what a reviewer dislikes. With ""Bobby"", I honestly have no clue as to what was so damn offensive. This is a heartfelt, extremely well done movie and I thought it was just terrific. Its not ""Airport"" with a gunshot finale..yes it takes place in a HOTEL. People stay at HOTELS. There is an event that night. You get snapshots into the lives of the PEOPLE. What should it have been about, Sirhan Sirhan's MOTHER? Its about how everyone FELT. It was five years after JFK and right after Martin Luther King. Viet Nam was a war in not a place anymore. This country was raw and in deep need of a hero. Bobby Kennedy could have been that hero. The magnitude of that loss is captured with a capital ""L""; Emilio has great respect for his audience and his subject matter.Its also not over-populated with stars in an effort to cover up the fact that there is nothing significant on the screen. I will admit that due to the bad press, I was somewhat skeptical going in but Emilio did it, he made a great movie that I am more than happy to praise. Didn't know he had it in him, but he does. Good for him, good for those who appreciate this movie, and if you don't, hey, your loss.",/review/rw1540805/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2006,Quinoa1984,5," kind of like a mixed garnish dish- lots of small pieces put together, good in parts, not filling on the whole
","Watching Emilio Estevez's Bobby is a curious experience because I never really felt like I was getting a fully satisfying dramatic piece of historical artifice. It goes for the Altman scheme of things with the stories being multi-layered, but with no purpose for what is really at the core or with enough really fascinating and true moments to make it really worthwhile (and, compared to Altman, who's style is usually as seamless as a pair of pants, he's much better at acting than at directing). But it's the kind of picture that I was glad I saw once, I guess, and if it were ever on TV I might check out a scene or two. What ends up being almost too frustrating about the production though is that it truly is one of the cases of the 'mixed bag', where some characters/scenes/performances are either quite good or surprisingly good or just adequate, and then some stuff just doesn't work at all.",/review/rw1540805/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2011,moonspinner55,5," An honorable attempt at recreating a tragic event in history...heartfelt, if pedestrian
","Writer-director-co-star Emilio Estevez takes a tragic, emotional event in American history--the June 5th, 1968 assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy by Sirhan Sirhan--and attempts to build a kaleidoscope of stories around it, giving personalities to the faces in the crowd that fateful night at Los Angeles' Ambassador Hotel. Curiously, Estevez chose not to focus on Kennedy (who is represented by newsreel footage), nor on Sirhan Sirhan, but on fictional (or fictionalized) characters such as a young couple marrying to keep the husband out of Vietnam; two young campaign workers who drop acid and spend the entire day goofing off; a Hispanic busboy at the hotel, fighting for equality and hoping to get the night off to see the Dodgers play; a beautician whose husband is cheating on her; and so on. With such a horrible tragedy looming over the third act of the picture, it's rather difficult to care about what color shoes Helen Hunt wears, or whether Lindsay Lohan's parents will turn up at her ceremony. Estevez has his heart in the right place (and his visual eye is impressive), but the screenplay is shallow and turgid, laughably underlined with a kind of political correctness which is supposed to make the picture seem relevant but is instead anachronistic. Star-studded cast generally fails to make an impression, though again this is the fault of the writing. ** from ****",/review/rw1540805/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2007,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: Bobby
","The name Kennedy is probably as close to ""royalty"" in the US as it can get, and it is of no surprise that the tragic events of the Kennedy brothers inspired movies to be made in their names. John F Kennedy, the 35th President of the USA, was assassinated in Dallas, Texas in 1963, and conspiracy theorists had a field day in suspecting there's more than meets the eye. I still remembered the day I watched Oliver Stone's JFK in the cinemas, and as a teen was captivated by the movie, which really went on and on and on with the stock archive footage of the shooting.",/review/rw1540805/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2006,alansaxon,10," very worth seeing
","""Bobby"" brings you back (if you were ever there) to the 60s, when those who protested the Vietnam War and racial injustice were motivated from their heart and torn by anger and grief in their efforts to change both. Yes the ensemble characters in the film are quite ordinary and their (sometimes) tawdry or pathetic shortcomings all too obvious and easy to sneer at, yet who could not recognize themselves in one or more of these vignettes. Robert Kennedy's assassination was felt by those who cared about him or his mission to the presidency as a deep wound to our own vision of a more compassionate and just America. The pettiness and simplicity of the characters in this movie are expertly directed to reveal our own pettiness and let us identify with them, if not consciously, then unconsciously. Remember, the top Hollywood actors in this movie were paid basic union scale (virtually free for them) so this was made for love. Our own little soap operas are put into such deep perspective that when he is killed, so were we, or at least the film lets you feel that. You find yourself loving this man, Robert Kennedy, for what he stood for and what he said during his candidacy, which is brilliantly threaded throughout the movie in his own words. The humanity you discover in him is of course your own humanity and isn't it refreshing to cry for yourself and your lost dreams as you cry for his.",/review/rw1540805/?ref_=tt_urv
