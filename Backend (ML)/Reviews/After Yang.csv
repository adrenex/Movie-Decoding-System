26 January 2013,bob the moo,," A visual feast but yet I wasn't gripped by the story or characters as much as I should have been
","When I heard that there was to be a film version of The Hobbit, I was quite looking forward to it as the big finish of Lord of the Rings was still in my mind and, unlike LotR, I had actually read The Hobbit several times many years ago. When I heard that it might be two films I wasn't surprised but the news that it was to be three did rather dampen my spirits as I don't know if I had the interest for this story to be concluded as 2016 rolls into town. Regardless I did of course watch the film because it is still a large blockbuster and, at a time of the year normally filled with overly earnest Oscar contenders, I did quite like the idea of returning to this world again.",/review/rw6012132/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2020,pmtelefon,8," It keeps getting better every time I see it
","I've seen ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" quite a few times now. I like it a lot. The first few times I watched it I found it hit and miss. The movie still takes a couple of dips here and there but those parts don't bother me as much as they used to. Now the only demerit I give this movie has to do with its length. It's a about twenty minutes too long. Otherwise, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is a very exciting and emotional ride. It's also a great looking movie with very good music. This movie is always a welcome visit.",/review/rw6012132/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2020,auuwws,8," The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey
","A very good start to the series. Very sensitive for the rest of the process, even though the movie was slow for the first half hour, it didn't affect my experience that much. The story is fun and interesting. Most of the film's protagonists were fun and watching Gandalf bring back memories of The Lord of the Rings. Filming and directing dazzles you and makes you wish to live in the world of cinema, especially in the Elf area. Although the film is not at the level of The Lord of the Rings, it is still excellent.",/review/rw6012132/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2013,Tweekums,7," The first of three long films based on a short book
","As this film opens an elderly Bilbo Baggins explains how the once great Dwarfs were forced out of their mountain kingdom by the dragon Smaug. He begins to talk of a great adventure and we are transported back to shortly before the adventure began when a young Bilbo meets the wizard Gandalf the Grey. He invites Bilbo on an adventure but he declines; the next day thirteen Dwarfs turn up at Bilbo's home believing that they have been invited. They tell him of their quest but he initially refuses; he has no desire to leave home. The next morning he changes his mind and so begins a quest that will see them fighting trolls, orcs and goblins as well as meeting elves, another wizard and in Bilbo's case the somewhat crazed Smeagol who will become a lifelong enemy following the theft of a certain ring.",/review/rw6012132/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," The Hobbit
","It's definitely no LOTR...But it's still a pretty cool movie. Sure, it took it's time to try to tell the story and dragged on for a little too long, but other than that, the special effects were great, and it was entertaining as hell. It's a good introduction to The Hobbit franchise.",/review/rw6012132/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2020,G00fhunter,8," An Unexpected Movie
","Let me start by saying that i have never watched any of the Lord of The Rings movies before.I was told to start with the hobbit. I was amazed at how cool this franchise must be as i loved every minute of it.I kinda feel ashamed for not giving this series a try earlier. 8/10 from me ,yeah that good.",/review/rw6012132/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2022,Reviewer746,5," Why Does it Fail?
","With nearly the same creative team behind the masterfully made Lord of the Rings trilogy, why did The Hobbit trilogy fall so flat for most viewers? Was it merely that the bar had been set too high by LOTR? Here are the most plausible reasons I can come up with.",/review/rw6012132/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2012,dlpburke,1," Yeahhhh! Graphics! Action scenes! AWESOOOME!
","Let's kick off with the score I've given it. 5/10. That's for the reasonable job with the comedy, design, and things not related to story and pacing (with the exception of Gollum and the cave scene). I am tired of saying ""The graphics are great, but..."" I have rated it 1 here to reduce the average in order to reflect reality and not the fanboy love-in.",/review/rw6012132/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,kevin_robbins,9," This is an underrated gem that gets overshadowed by the greatness of Lord of the Rings
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012) is a movie I originally saw in theaters, is in my DVD collection and I recently rewatched with my daughter on HBOMAX. The storyline for this picture involves our old friend, Bilbo Baggins, as a youth when Gandalf the wizard shows up at his door about an adventure. Bilbo says no but that night 12 dwarfs show up at his door and tells him a story about a dragon that stole their homeland and gold. They would like to return home, regain their kingdom and need Bilbo's help to make that happen. Bilbo will try to say no, but we all know he can't.",/review/rw6012132/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2012,markdroulston,4," An unexpected disappointment
","""All great stories deserve a little embellishment."" So says Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) in the most telling line in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Peter Jackson's return to the world of JRR Tolkien. It's a line that clearly outlines Jackson and his co-writers' intentions, yet it comes off as a veiled apology, as if the film-making team knew that what they have created is going to be problematic for die-hard Middle Earth fans. Sadly, Jackson's new film doesn't come close to silencing the skeptics like his Lord of the Rings films did, and is actually more ill-conceived than expected.",/review/rw6012132/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2013,kosmasp,8," The Ring: Beginning
","I never came around to read the LotR books before watching the movies and I actually haven't done that until now (so maybe shame on me), but I did read 30-40 pages of the Hobbit. And it seems, like almost everyone of those pages turns out to be in the movie. It's a big scene and it feels like Peter Jackson put almost everything in it. He apparently also put other Tolkien related stuff in it.",/review/rw6012132/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2012,Likes_Ninjas90,4," A deliberately inflated work of fanfare, with eyes drawn acutely towards the box office
","This is the first of three films Peter Jackson has made to adapt J.R.R. Tolkien's prequel to Lord of the Rings. An elderly Bilbo Baggins writes to Frodo about the land of Erebor, where the Dwarf King Thror lost his land and prosperity to the dragon Smaug. Bilbo then recalls the earlier years of his life (played by Martin Freeman), where he's timid and lost his sense of adventure. Bilbo's complacency is questioned by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), who secretly arranges for a meeting to be held in the hobbit's house. One evening Bilbo is interrupted by thirteen dwarfs who invite themselves inside. He's told these dwarfs are in search of a home but need a burglar who can accompany them to the mountain where Smaug is and take back their land and treasure. Initially reluctant, Bilbo trails after the unit but this does little to impress Thorin (Richard Armitage), the dwarf leader and grandson of Thror, who doubts the hobbit's commitment.

17 October 2022,andmikkelsen,8," Not groundbreaking but still a great fantasy experience!
","I Remember the first time i watched this movie in the cinema and i did not like it as much i thought i would! Maybe it was because my hopes were very high after LOTR and while this movie gad elements from that, it didn't reach the same level in terms of story and visuals!",/review/rw6012132/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2013,JohnWelles,9," Let the Magic Begin...
","""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" simultaneously takes director Peter Jackson in two different directions. While at first glance it may seem that he is travelling over familiar ground, again tackling the fantastical world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth after his vast and Academy Award wining ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy (2001 â€“ 2003), he is actually experimenting with cinema itself.",/review/rw6012132/?ref_=tt_urv

11 December 2012,dfranzen70,9," Fits perfectly within the LOTR universe
","A shortish book is drawn out to not one but three full-length feature films, the better to flesh out characters who need, uh, fleshing, and the better to tell every bit of the tale.

19 December 2012,Theo Robertson,7," Familiarity Breeds Contempt
","I absolutely adored LORD OF THE RINGS especially the first film Fellowship Of The Ring and when it was announced THE HOBBIT was going to be turned in to a film I looked forward . Part of the reason I enjoyed LOTR is probably down to the fact I'd never read Tolkien . One point that did cause slight reservations for me is that people who had read THE HOBBIT commentated that there wasn't enough material there for a film trilogy . When the An Unexpected Journey was ready for release it was announced that its running time came to 168 minutes . Added to this director Peter Jackson seemed to have a problem with narrative drive in KING KONG and this got minor alarm bells running in my head . Was this going to be an overblown , overlong fiasco ?",/review/rw6012132/?ref_=tt_urv

13 December 2012,Munin75,9," The rather numerous negative professional reviews almost made me lose hope. Turns out they were wrong. The Hobbit is a fantastic film.
","First of all, let me first say that while I enjoyed the LOTR trilogy, and admired the directorial and technical greatness of it, I'm no LOTR fanboy, and I also recognize its flaws. I'm saying this so that one understands that I'm not the type of person who will blindly speak greatly of any film of the Tolkien/Jackson series if I don't feel it deserves it.",/review/rw6012132/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2012,Al_The_Strange,10," ""The world is not in your book and maps. It's out there!""
","Ten years ago, I laid eyes on Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, and instantly fell in love. I realized pretty quickly that it was the perfect combination of style and substance: a film so loaded with story and detail, but also had enough style and action to make the experience truly epic. This experience would only be supplanted by The Two Towers and The Return of the King, the latter of which has taken its place as my personal number-one favorite movie.",/review/rw6012132/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2012,billygoat1071,9," A Tremendous Introduction
","The Lord of the Rings has been a timeless epic classic that is hard for other fantasy, Tolkien wannabe movies to capture its magic and so far, director Peter Jackson is probably the only one who can capture it. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first part of a split trilogy of its prequel. Though, J.R.R. Tolkien's book is not really that long for a split and the film is even a lot longer as the story's introduction. The result of the movie is it's rather too long and a bit slow but the experience is still worth it. With its spectacular visuals and grand scale, it's all pretty exciting. Despite of its stretch, the film's genuinely unique enjoyment made this easily one of the best blockbusters of the year.",/review/rw6012132/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2013,SnoopyStyle,7," too long
",This was too long... way too long. There is no reason to extend the movie to this length. The only reason I could see is that Peter Jackson doesn't have anybody who could say no to him. The pacing drags way too much in too many places. He tries desperately to add whimsy to this movie. However the slow pace and the hokey characterization really causes a lot of problems.,/review/rw6012132/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2012,SongOfFall,1," Soulless commercial ride on the Hollywood roller-coaster
","THE QUALITY OF THE FILM Imagine ""Spy Kids"" with elements of Tolkien's writing. Technological demonstration, a large budget at the hands of a tasteless creative group. The CG animation of trolls was almost as ugly as in the Lord of the Rings. The only reason of making it 3D was making me cope with the uncomfortably of 3D. The dwarf parcour and scenes copied from the Lord of the Rings (compare the fight of Thorin and Azog with that of Isildur and Sauron), artificially added action-scenes and castrated non-action scenes spoke of lazy, commercial, mainstream work. Radagast's animal companions were Walt Disney's ""Snow-white"" bad.",/review/rw6012132/?ref_=tt_urv
