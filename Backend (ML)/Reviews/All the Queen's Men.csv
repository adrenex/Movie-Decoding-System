5 August 2014,TxMike,," A man trapped in his own mind, his own 'Enemy', trying to make sense of it.
","I watched this movie last night. I must admit that it kept me interested but when it was over I felt it was too ambiguous, too open to multiple interpretations. Even when you view the DVD extra, the cast and director came up with a list of questions, but the book's author died before they could ask him. So in a real sense the director and actors are not fully certain what the movie was about, except that much of it, if not all, was taking place in the main character's mind.",/review/rw2995394/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2014,CinemaClown,," More An Art House Film Than Mainstream Feature.
","Asking for your attention at all times, providing little clues in almost every sequence & still leaving you puzzled in the end, Enemy inclines more towards art house cinema than mainstream features and isn't going to please every viewer out there. It tells the story of a college professor living a mundane daily life who later seeks out his doppelgänger after spotting him in a movie thus setting in motion a chain of events which culminates with terrible consequences.",/review/rw2995394/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2017,TheLittleSongbird,7," Definitely does stay with you
","Denis Villeneuve to me is a hugely talented director, and the six films seen of his so far have all been good to outstanding. 'Sicario', 'Incendies' and 'Blade Runner 2049' are especially good. 'Prisoners' was very good and almost great until let down by the ending and while 'Arrival' had its issues it was also well done with a lot to admire.",/review/rw2995394/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2014,brando647,8," An Addicting Mind-Bender from the Director of PRISONERS
","Denis Villeneuve garnered a lot of attention for his mainstream success with PRISONERS, starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, but it was it smaller, more obscure release that I wanted to see. ENEMY was released around the same time as PRISONERS but never saw a national release and I had to wait for the home video release to finally catch it. Watching it, I figured out why it never went mainstream. Most general audiences don't like something they can't understand, and ENEMY is probably best described as a mental cluster fumess. It has a surface plot that's easy enough to understand but the film is loaded with symbolism and deeper themes. Most of which can't be discussed without entering spoiler territory so I won't touch on it much, but this is a movie that inspires discussion orat the very leastwill leave you contemplating it long after it ends. I know my first viewing led to two days of thought trying to decipher what I'd seen and it wasn't until I scoured the Internet, reading over the frustration of others and the myriad of proposed meanings, that I felt I'd come to an understanding. But that's me and my obsessive nature, and others can do their own research. On the surface, ENEMY is about history teacher Adam Bell (Gyllenhaal). Adam is suggested a film from a work colleague that he might enjoy and becomes obsessed when an extra in the film looks exactly like him. He tracks the actor down, Anthony (also Gyllenhaal), and discovers they're physically identical in every way. And then it gets weird.",/review/rw2995394/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2014,trublu215,9," A disturbing psychological thriller
","Enemy is the latest thriller from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, and it stands as a hybrid mix of David Lynch and David Fincher at their very finest. Enemy follows Adam (Jake Gyllenhaal) on a journey to find his exact lookalike named Anthony, a terrible D-list celebrity. As his investigation deepens, the mystery thickens and he is thrown into a fray way above his head. What works in Enemy is Gyllenhaal's fearless performance as a man who is searching to find who he really is. There are a couple scenes that he has where is truly riveting and it becomes so hard to take your eyes off the screen. It really is an explosive yet very contained performance that I feel needs a lot of recognition. Enemy marks itself as a film about identity and never knowing who you truly are and the pressures of wanting to become something you're not. While it remains as a heavy message, it still makes for a film that almost demands repeat viewings. At 90 minutes even, the film moves and never slows down enough for us to even breathe. Before we can even question what is going on in one scene, Villeneuve throws us another curve ball to contend with. While that may bring confusion to many people, it is very welcoming to a viewer in the mood to do some serious thinking. Anything beyond that, it may garner some negative responses especially if you're not paying close attention. Enemy works well as a psychological thriller, bringing some of the most disturbing images I've seen on screen in recent years. This film is NOT scary, but it is extremely uneasy and very creepy, especially towards the last twenty minutes of the film, which had me holding my breath as we finally discover the truth of what is going on.",/review/rw2995394/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2014,SnoopyStyle,7," weirdly intriguing
","Adam Bell (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a history professor at UGT in Toronto. He lives a tired monotonous life with his girlfriend Mary (Mélanie Laurent). On a recommendation, he rents a movie and finds a bit actor named Daniel Saint Claire who looks exactly like him. After some searching, he finds that Daniel's real name is Anthony Claire and he's married to the pregnant Helen (Sarah Gadon).",/review/rw2995394/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2014,gradyharp,10," 'Chaos is order yet undeciphered'
","Portuguese author José Saramago (1922 – 2010), whose celebrated novels can be seen as allegories and commonly present subversive perspectives on historic events, emphasizing the human factor (BLINDNESS, SEEING, THE STONE RAFT, THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO Jesus Christ, DEATH WITH INTERRUPTIONS, THE CAVE, ALL THE NAMES, CAIN etc), published THE DOUBLE in 2002: it took more than 10 years before being transformed for the screen by Javier Gullón and directed by Canadian Denis Villeneuve. For those who remain under the spell of Saramago's strange and seductively intelligent writing this film will satisfy. For those who prefer linear story lines of everyday possibilities the film will likely not find an appreciative audience. This is a film that demands the full attention of the viewer and the acceptance of alternative ways of viewing reality and alternative reality.",/review/rw2995394/?ref_=tt_urv

","Although it doesn't seem that our main character here has any choice/saying in all this anyway. But let's backtrack a little bit and let me rather start with an advice. If you want to watch a movie and just lay back, not wanting to think about anything, this is not the movie to watch. This movie here is something that will mess with your head and you might not like that.",/review/rw2995394/?ref_=tt_urv

","The proper way to watch this film is to be committed to working your hardest to decipher it. I believe the only real satisfaction could be from putting the pieces together in a way that comes to a logical conclusion that you feel comfortable with, because Enemy will not hand it over to you. I failed to commit this much mental fortitude and my viewing experience suffered because of it.",/review/rw2995394/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2014,bob the moo,," Perhaps not as smart as it thinks it is, and for sure not a thriller – but engagingly atmospheric
","This film is listed as a thriller/mystery and the plot summary suggests that it will be a great slice of sci-fi ideasmanship with a big Hollywood name in the lead. Regardless of whether the film is any good or not, it is pretty important that you ditch expectations at the door, because this is not so much a thriller as it is a character piece that uses this device to explore its central character(s). You need to know this because ultimately the film is very slow, really doesn't give you anything in the way of easy answers and will require you to think back over the film once you do reach the ending. So while it is generally good to come to a film without knowing much about it, it is best here to go in without bringing your own assumptions.",/review/rw2995394/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2020,tarantino_feet_pics,7," Thoughts on Enemy
","Enemy is a very good psychological thriller. Jake Gyllenhaal plays two great
subtle characters. The muted colour palette and eerie score give a great atmosphere. Denis Villeneuve purposely leaves it vague and open ended. It's very strange had hard to decipher. I found it to be a lot more enjoyable upon trying to uncover its meaning and narrative. Upon a passive viewing and likely a first viewing Enemy is hard to understand and seems a bit nonsensical or chaotic. But as the opening card says 'chaos is order yet undeciphered.' So let me try:",/review/rw2995394/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2014,jovanovicslo,9," Psychological masterpiece - a movie for every man's mind.
","First thing that came to mind about this movie is, how much it reminds me of Kubrick's: Eyes Wide Shut. It's surrealism, it's ambiance, atmosphere and the theme nonetheless. The movie is beautifully woven together into a magical and complete world of it's own. In which some people who saw the film lost themselves and found it frustrating, and others found a magical way of portraying the character's mind. I must admit, I am one of the latter.",/review/rw2995394/?ref_=tt_urv

","I can't remember being more disappointed in a film. As you watch it, if none of it makes any sense to you, please know you aren't alone. I imagine that at the outset of this project it had a plot. It must have ended up on the cutting room floor, so to speak. (I don't imagine actual cutting rooms exist anymore.) Good grief. Such a waste of my time.

18 November 2013,corrosion-2,7," Kafka meets Lynch!
","Denis Villeneuve, whose last two films were the hugely impressive Incendies and Prisoners, has concocted a real oddity here. If you can imagine David Lynch adapting a Kafka novel, then you will be in the right neighborhood! In Incendies and Prisoners,Villeneuve inserted serious moral and social issues in the context of first rate thrillers' Here he follows the same tradition but the tone is more abstract and absurd. Neverherless, Enemy, adapted from a novel by the Nobel prize winner Jose Saramago, is always gripping and totally fascinating. A man (Jake Gyllenhaal) gets a recommendation from a colleague to watch a particular video. The main actor in the video appears to be his doppelgänger and the two agree to meet. To reveal any more would lessen the enjoyment of this highly original film. Well worth catching.",/review/rw2995394/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2014,shawneofthedead,5," Smart and intriguing, but so resolutely oblique that it's hard to really care about how (oddly) it ends.
","From The Prince And The Pauper through to Sweet Valley High, literature and fiction has held a particular fascination with the notion of doppelgangers: two (or more) individuals who are physically identical and yet fundamentally different, whether in personality or social station. Denis Villeneuve's Enemy, a psychologically-charged mystery that's more thoughtful than thrilling, explores the idea that there's someone else in the world who shares your face but has, seemingly, nothing else to do with you. It's fascinating, mostly, but also slow- moving and, ultimately, frustrating.",/review/rw2995394/?ref_=tt_urv
