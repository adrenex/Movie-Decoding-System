26 December 2019,Fella_shibby,8," Hop onto this drop tower ride n be ready for ur giggle to turn into a guffaw, tensing ur diaphragm n thereby gaining a solid ab workout.
","First saw this in 2010 on a dvd which i own.
Revisited it recently. As a fan of Woody Harrelson, I enjoyed this even more.
The film follows four fellas making their way through the zombie apocalypse on a road trip.
While one fella has a set of rules to survive, another has a craving for Twinkies and stops to acquire some even with the threat of zombies roaming the countryside.
The list of rules, especially cardio, for surviving in the zombie-infested world, a clown-zombie n the drop tower ride, r all uniquely the highlight.",/review/rw2177681/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2019,pawanpunjabithewriter,7," From Nothing to a joyous ride of fun & entertainment
","From nothing means Zombie stories don't have much in it except from zombies and a nerdy guy who saves the world and becomes a hero. That's why Zombie movies aren't my favorite, except for Zombieland.
I probably had the best movie dialogue of the month in this one. ""That's like asking who Gandhi is!""
The whole Bill Murray house was exceptional. I can't believe I saw the full House of Bill Murray. I felt as if I was literally seeing him.
Could have shown more of the house, it was indeed fun.
The four actors were remarkable, mainly the top 3! Tallahassee looked a perfect Texas man. They chose him correctly.",/review/rw2177681/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2017,gbill-74877,8," Very entertaining
","There is some (probably requisite) violence in this zombie thriller, but it's also got humor, some nice touches in editing, and it's very entertaining. The cast is fantastic, with Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Jesse Eisenberg, and Abigail Breslin all turning in performances perfectly tuned to the genre. The scenes with Bill Murray are all very funny, and one part in particular is absolutely hilarious, but I won't spoil it. Eisenberg channels Woody Allen at times with his shy awkwardness. Trying to do both comedy and horror is difficult, but director Ruben Fleischer really pulls it off. This is a fun movie to watch.",/review/rw2177681/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2009,the-movie-guy,7," Zombieland is a horror comedy at its best
","(Synopsis) The entire world is hit with an apocalyptic infection that turns people into zombies once they have been bitten by an infected zombie. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a young geek who has a lot of phobias about almost everything from clowns, to bathrooms, to checking the back seat of cars. Being alone and scared of the outside world has kept him alive. His new fear is being eaten by zombies. To survive, Columbus has begun making a long list of rules to survive. Each time he gives you one of his rules, you see an example of his rule in action. He decides to go home to Columbus to see if his parents are still alive. Along the highway, he meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) a redneck zombie killer who loves Twinkies. They team up and head for Tallahassee. On the way they meet and join forces with two girls, Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abagail Breslin). They may be the last surviving people on earth, and they must rely on each other to survive.",/review/rw2177681/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2009,Apemangalore,9," Will undoubtedly become a cult classic
","Arguably one of the finest horror comedies of all time is Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead, and since its release in '04, there have been a good number of wannabes. Based on the trailers for Zombieland, however, I thought that the film had some serious potential to match Shaun in terms of quality, possibly even usurp it. Having seen the film, I'm happy to say that Zombieland does just that.",/review/rw2177681/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2017,atlasmb,8," This Parody Of Zombie Films Is So Much Fun

5 April 2016,CANpatbuck3664,10," Hilarious Dialogue, Fun Visuals and Some Breakout Performances, It's One Of My Favourite Movies
","After Batman v Superman I wanted to go back and watch a movie where I was impressed with Jesse Eisenberg. Zombieland is one of my favourites, so it was an easy choice. They continue to talk about a Zombieland sequel today even though it's been years since the original has been released. I'd like to think that's how big of an impact it made (it was a box office success but it didn't go over like gangbusters). It's probably too late for a sequel with the entire cast moving on and becoming industry headliners, but it's okay though because we'll always have this one.",/review/rw2177681/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2015,anaconda-40658,8," The Next Shaun of the Dead.
","Zombieland (2009): Dir: Ruben Fleischer / Cast: Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Abigale Breslin, Bill Murray: Horror comedy about a decayed society where zombies roam about for blood and any remaining people struggle to survive. Although the ending never really resolves anything, the screenplay is detailed and unique climaxing at an amusement park where Zombies are splattered with creativity. Directed by Ruben Fleischer with graphic yet effective production. While the zombie comedy theme was also effective in Shaun of the Dead, Fleischer also has fun with many humorous scenes involving zombies in not so desirable light. Jesse Eisenberg narrates his fears and lack of family. He first gives an effective narration regarding the rules of zombie survival, then he encounters Woody Harrelson, a zombie killer. Harrelson steals the film as a twinkie craving zombie killer who takes them to the home of a famous Hollywood persona. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin play two females who aren't who they seem. They steal their weapons while relying on each other for survival but eventually Eisenberg calls for a truce. Bill Murray is involved in the film's best joke when he appears to be playing himself undercover in this zombie society. While the world view presented here is hopeless and depressing, its society satire makes it one of the more clever zombie movies. Score: 8 / 10",/review/rw2177681/?ref_=tt_urv

4 July 2010,planktonrules,8," The epitome of 'turn off your brain and enjoy'.
","This is NOT a film that will be up for any awards this year (except for maybe those from Fangoria), as it is not an art or prestige movie--nor is it something you'll likely see in the Criterion Collection! No, this film is about as far from this sort of movie as you can get, as it's a 'turn off your brain and enjoy' film--one you can't think too much about but there is still something about it you'll probably like. I say PROBABLY because if you can't stand gore or profuse swearing, then go no further--this is clearly a film to avoid. But, provided you have a relatively high tolerance for this sort of thing, it's a good bet to see--in particular if you've seen and enjoyed ""Sean of the Dead"". While ""Sean"" is a better film, it's roughly along the same lines--an irreverent comedy about zombie-killers!",/review/rw2177681/?ref_=tt_urv

6 April 2020,KoolCatReviews,7," An amusing and fun zombie adventure
",A fun adventure that will surely keep you entertained through out. Zombies aren't too scary but they do provide for good action. This movie has a really great opening. You will be drawn into its charm and its loveable characters. Though out you will feel a sense of adventure with some highly comical moments. The balance between laughs and action is kept about right. Some of the emotional elements later in the film can be quiet weak by the end it wraps its self up nicely.,/review/rw2177681/?ref_=tt_urv

","The name Zombieland conjures up a vision of a zombie-themed amusement park -- and that's exactly what this film is. Visually stylish and the most laughs I've had at the movies in a long time. A really solid script and nice underlying story really helps make this so much more than just a bunch of awesome zombie kills. That being said, this film feels as if you're playing a really badass zombie killing video game.",/review/rw2177681/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2009,drono2,8," Very Pleasant Surprise...
","Just came from a sneak preview held in Baltimore and left the theater feeling very satisfied. You don't normally find a late September movie as good as ""Zombieland"" was. After dropping you in the action right from the start, the movie keeps coming with constant laughs and good action. There were not a lot of scares in the movie, other than the few obvious scenes where you could see one coming, but horror is not what the director was going for in this film. Laughs, however, come often and from many different directions. Jessie Eisenberg's nerdy, insecure 'Columbus' character and Woody Harrelson's redneck zombie-killing 'Tallahassee' play very well off each other and provide plenty of memorable moments. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are also solid throughout. There is also one unforgettable cameo that had most of the audience rolling in the aisles. The film has a simple, easy to follow storyline that does not provoke a lot of questions. Indeed, if you go to this movie expecting a lot of plot twists and surprises, you're going to be severely disappointed. There is however, good action, good laughs, and plenty of zombie related gore. At about 90 minutes long, it does not drag on and gets to the predictable but satisfying ending, going out in style. There will no doubt be a lot of comparisons to ""Shaun of the Dead"", which is nothing to be ashamed of, but this is truly a one of a kind movie experience that holds its own with any not only any zombie movie in recent memory, but with any comedy so far this year. As long as you don't go into this movie expecting too much, you'll get your money's worth. Well done.",/review/rw2177681/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2009,KillerK1991,8," America's answer to Shaun of the Dead.
","This film was a fun ride all the way through. It's lack of scariness(non existent) and *GASP!* gore is more than made up for with the constant flow of hilarity and likable characters. This is by far the optimist's zombie film, as the way things play out are definitely different than any one thats come before it(definitely not a Romero flick, though I think his Land of the Dead actually is second place in this regard). It has a sleek, very modern sense of style-just watch for how each rule makes it's appearance/reappearance and a good message on the importance of others in the worst of times. I recommend this to anybody who has a remote interest in comedies, zombie/end of the world flicks, or just having a good time at the theater, and look forward to seeing it again when it comes out.",/review/rw2177681/?ref_=tt_urv

18 February 2013,ironhorse_iv,8," This movie is a trip! A fun ride across Zombieland.
","Unlike Adventureland, Jesse Eisenberg's previous movie, this movie is a lot better and truly is a fun adventure. Plus, this one is funny as hell. Jesse is another Michael Cera. Call me old fashioned, but the whole mumbling-mono toned-socially awkward-skinny-nerd thing just does absolutely nothing for me, but at less Jesse does make this movie do. Two months have passed since mad cow disease mutated into mad man disease. Unaffected college student ""Columbus"" (Jesse Eisenberg) is making his way on the road to Columbus, Ohio to check out if his parents made it. On the way, he meets ""Tallahassee"" (Woody Harrelson), another survivor whom looking for purpose, and see it's in his never-ending quest for Twinkies. Twinkie production in the United States ceased in November 2012 in a weird off way. So it's seem realist that Twinkie would be hard to find after the 'zombie' invasion. Before 2012, it might not. It's a funny major part of his character, and it's pretty obvious the tasty cakes supply him with some form of comfort in a land torn to shreds by zombies, as it's also 'hide' something deep, as he seeking something more than that in his mind. Woody Harrison really took this role serious. Shortly after finishing the filming of Zombieland, Harrelson had an altercation with a TMZ photographer. His defense was that he was still in character and thought the cameraman was a zombie. I don't buy it, but who knows. He's smoking something. The pair meet ""Wichita"" (Emma Stone) and her younger sister ""Little Rock"" (Abigail Breslin) in a grocery store. The sisters, who are masterful con artists, trick Tallahassee and Columbus into handing over their weapons, then steal their car, not once, but twice when the boys try to find them again. I don't know why Tallahassee and Columbus doesn't end up killing them, since the con girls pretty much left them for dead, the first time. That's something you just can't forget, and we suppose to believe Columbus will fall in love with Emma Stone. The con girls were obnoxious and poorly written. I know they have trust issues, but that's pretty crude. The boys were written to be dumb, and stupid. Somehow, all four of them reached a state of Détente. All of them, decide to go to try their chances at Los Angeles. It's odd in a way, that Columbus never really did go to Columbus to check out his parents even with the town being decimated, there still a chance. He gives up way too easily for his love ones. The movie takes the four all throughout Zombie America. The movie is all fun, sadly the scares are non existent, and the good kills are just plain no where to be found. The movie has way too many scene-killing Voice Overs and scenes that makes zero sense. Now for the good of the movie, I love the running gag, and a central theme throughout the film, is the list of rules Columbus comes up with for surviving in the zombie-infested world. It's reminds me of the Max Brook's novel 'The Zombie Survival Guide'. Wish the movie had time to use all the 49 rules, but a few were mentioned in the film. It's makes me wonder what he meant with avoid strip clubs and bowling ball. The Character names are interesting as well, as the movie doesn't use the real names, but identify them using the names that relate to them. The movie also has a great cameo, but it's sadly it's short and underused. Another thing underused is the 'Zombie Kill of the Week' as the movie only mention one, with a character that isn't relate to the plot. I think Director Ruben Fleischer try way too much to fit as much fun into it, and some of them had to left out. The humor is smart mouth, living up to the catchphrase of 'nut up or shut up' style. It's a movie that doesn't take itself so serious, but does when needed. Check out Zombieland and visit the sites.",/review/rw2177681/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2009,Quinoa1984,10," how to have a kick-ass time and laugh your brains out with people... and zombies too
","Inevitably, Zombieland will be (and already has been) compared to Shaun of the Dead, the other most notable ""Zom-Com"" of this past decade (or in that case 'Rom-Zom' due to it being a romantic comedy with zombies). This goes without noting other notable zombie-related comedies like Fido or involving animals like Black Sheep. But if one has to compare apples and oranges growing on practically the same field, here's the difference: 1) as much as I love Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's work (specifically Hot Fuzz and Spaced), SOTD started to not be quite as effective, even as it was being admirably tried out technically, when it switched from a really funny and spot-on comedy and spoof of Romero's film to suddenly taking itself a bit too seriously as a zombie movie. 2) I (almost) hate to say this, but... Zombieland ultimately wins on counts of being so funny- or as the kids say, ""f***in' funny as hell, OMG""- that it hurts, and giving us characters to take away with that we care about when, you know, they aren't slaughtering the undead one by one. It's also so bad-ass you can taste the awesome, something rare to find in movies outside of the Road Warrior.",/review/rw2177681/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2009,blackmambamark,8," The most fun i have had at the theatre in a long time
","I mean come on, who doesn't think about what they would do if zombies took over the world. Its a fun, yet serious question to think about. Most movies have it right, by taking the serious side of things. But what if we take a video game approach and just run around killing everyone of them? Uh.......you can more than sign me up for this one. OK, lets face the honest question.......if your some little prissy girl who does not like or does not appreciate zombie films.......then this is the wrong movie for you. This movie takes everything you have learned from all those movies, and puts a comedic spin on it. I mean come on, a zombie stripper wearing nipple tasles running in slow motion.....how could anyone not want to see that? The movie is very basic in its groundwork, but excels in its humor and character drive. Woody is basically a zombie film buff's wet dream. A hoosier red neck who wants to just kill zombies for the rest of his life. Now i must admit, towards the middle of the movie, it almost felt like they weren't focusing on the whole zombie aspect that much........mainly because they were adding a little depth to each of the characters. But rest assured, by the end, it totally quenches your thirst. But through all the hilarious dialogue and funny little zombie killing sequences, the best part of the movie was hands down the cameo. Now if you have not heard who it is by now, im not going to say it........but it is almost genius, and probably the best cameo ever created, and i will stand by that 100%. Trust me, it is that funny. Bottom Line.......i know i love zombie movies, and i might seem a little bias........but damnit, this movie is easily the best comedy of the year. It was the perfect mix of humor and gore........not only that, the story was pretty decent, and very entertaining to watch unfold. This movie is seriously like a fun house at the carnival. It will easily be accepted by the zombie lover crowd, and the general population. This movie is easily one of the 10 best i have seen so far this year. If your looking to have a good time at the theatre, this movie will surely provide that.",/review/rw2177681/?ref_=tt_urv
