","Never watched the show, so can't compare the two, or whether or not this is a faithful adaptation of it or not, but I loved this film. It perfectly rides the fine line between straight 1960s spy movie throwback, and satire of one.",/review/rw3301733/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2019,elin-95794,10," Really wish there was a second and third movie
","I love this movie so much. The first time I watched it with a friend, we jumped back in the movie so many times to rewatch all our favourite parts over and over again.
I've watched it a couple of times, and I still like it so so much. I've always liked spy movies. Growing up watching Bond. This movie is fun and clever and it's just a great movie. I might just go and rewatch it right now actually.",/review/rw3301733/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2019,Tweekums,8," A fun movie reboot of a classic TV series
","This film is set in the early sixties and opens in East Berlin as CIA agent Napoleon Solo attempts to extract a German woman, Gaby Teller. Her father had worked for the Nazi missile programme before being taken to the United States; now he has gone missing and is presumed to be working for a group that will make atomic bombs for anybody who will pay them. A Soviet agent, Ilya Kuryakin, who is clearly highly skilled, tries to stop them but is ultimately unsuccessful. Shortly afterward, in West Berlin, the three of them are reunited and they are told that they will be working together in a joint US/USSR mission. Travelling to Rome, with Ilya posing as Gaby's fiancé and Napoleon posing as a thief they make contact with Gaby's uncle and attempt to find her father and infiltrate the criminal organisation.",/review/rw3301733/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2015,kosmasp,8," Fun watch
","I never watched the original TV show, but a friend of mine did, and he was really excited about this movie. Even I could tell they really put some effort in this. You get thrown back into an era you might (very likely) not know. But that shouldn't take away the fun you can have with this.",/review/rw3301733/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2015,Chalice_Of_Evil,9," Man of Cool...
","Towards the end of the movie, Henry Cavill's Napoleon Solo asks, ""How's THAT for entertainment?"" (when teaching the movie's villain a lesson about monologuing), and my answer regarding this movie would have to echo Waverly's ""very good"", as this film manages to out-Bond the last two actual Bond films. While it might be the unpopular opinion, I in fact enjoyed Guy Ritchie's two Sherlock Holmes films and so decided to give this a chance, knowing nothing about the original TV series this movie was based on and going in with no preconceived notions. One thing that sets it apart from other recent spy thrillers is it staying set in the 60s time period and not being ""modernised"". From the opening ""spy jazz"" music, it sets the tone for what will be a fun ride. Ritchie's unique directing style fits perfectly with this slick/stylish film and he proves once again to have the right touch when it comes to blending humor with serious moments (one example being in the most morbidly amusing torture sequence I've seen since Bond's in Casino Royale). Whilst there are ""talky"" moments and occasions where the camera lingers on a shot for a solid moment, which those with impatience may grow restless during, there's also action (but not such that it's overkill) mixed with humour, some emotional beats and even the odd sexy moment. It all combines extremely well.",/review/rw3301733/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2015,socrates99,9," At this rate I'll have to see all of Ritchie's films
","Remembering the TV show, just barely, I remember I liked Illya a little better than Napoleon. That hasn't changed in this far better version. This movie is a joy and I either smiled or laughed through the whole thing. There is no way they're not making a sequel.",/review/rw3301733/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2019,inkblot11,8," Could not always follow the plot but this is a hip, stylish film with handsome stars
","In the early sixties, Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) goes to rescue a beautiful damsel Gaby (Alicia Vikander) from East Berlin. She's an auto mechanic and doesn't really find that Napoleon is the greatest rescuer, as they are in immediate peril from a Russian, Ilya Kuriakin (Armie Hammer). After a great chase scene, the new duo get away to Italy, where they hope to find Gaby's long lost papa. All too soon, it becomes clear that the papa is helping an evil woman, Victoria, and her gang develop a nuclear weapon for nefarious purposes. Unexpectedly, Ilya joins forces with them and Gaby poses as Ilya's fiancee. In truth, the two like what they see in the other. With setbacks along the way, the trio eventually find a moment to turn the tables on the bad, bad lady. Will they be successful? My plot summary for this film is woeful, for I had trouble following the storyline. However, it didn't matter a smidgen as the action and stars and cool-factor made up for everything. Cavill and Hammer are great as the new daring duo and Vikander's breathy, matchless voice and beauty are always welcome. And, wow, does she look good in Mary Quant! All of the scenery is yummy and the special effects quite thrilling. If you heard this film is not up to snuff, you heard WRONG!",/review/rw3301733/?ref_=tt_urv

","Is it possible I loved this so much purely because I didn't expect to even like it? Yep. Do I care? Nope. Ritchie's best since Lock, Stock, it's cooler than a suited cucumber with superspy skills. Funny, exciting and genuine breath of fresh air, & far better than the last Bond or Bourne movies, so why wasn't it a huge hit?!",/review/rw3301733/?ref_=tt_urv

","1963, the height of the Cold War. In an unlikely alliance, a CIA agent, Napoleon Solo (played by Henry Cavill) and KGB agent, Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer), band together to save the world from nuclear disaster. A top nuclear scientist, formerly employed by the US, has gone missing. It is suspected his brother has kidnapped him to work on a nuclear bomb. Solo and Kuryakin accompany the scientist's daughter, Gaby (Alicia Vikander), to Rome, as this is where her uncle is based. The idea is to covertly investigate his company and, hopefully, find the scientist and the bomb. Things aren't all plain sailing though. This is heightened by the fact that Solo and Kuryakin aren't sure they can trust each other and, to some extent, still regard each other as enemies.",/review/rw3301733/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2017,Mr-Fusion,8," Alright, now we've got ourselves a spy movie!
","I've never seen the original TV series (I feel obliged to offer some preface in these matters) but damn, there's just something so refreshing about ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."". Not just as a genre movie, which sets itself apart from modern spy fare with a certain restraint towards its action scenes (even the torture is unconventional), but as a '60s throwback. It creates a stylized Cold War setting, and it's one I totally wouldn't mind returning to; I love that Morricone/Schifrin score.",/review/rw3301733/?ref_=tt_urv

","Stylish and wildly entertaining, this spy thriller pits the charming CIA Cavill against the hilariously accented KGB Hammer, and when a villain threatens both sides, they find themselves teaming up.

","I had heard of the 60's television show ""The Man from UNCLE"", but like most of us under the age of 60, never got the chance to see an episode. I know, I know, there have been countless re-runs, it just never grabbed my attention. All I could go on were the words from my wise mother who stated, ""I used to watch that show when I was a kid back in the 60's. It starred.....oh what's his name.....Robert Vaughan."" She couldn't remember the other actor that starred along side Vaughan but I was guessing she was just thrilled to have something from her childhood reborn into the 21st Century.",/review/rw3301733/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2019,tabuno,9," A Delightful and Tantalizingly Original Spy Movie
","15 August 2015. This movie almost defies description because of its very originality and the difficult exercise of finding any comparable spy movies of significance. This full-length movie version based on the 1960s television series and becomes a sort of prequel to the series and allows the film's director to re-vitalize the period of the 50s in a stylized retro look. What director Guy Richie has accomplished is a more ambitious fusion of witty humor and serious emotive drama than his Sherlock Holmes (2009) and its accompanying Game of Shadows (2011) helmed by the mega-star Robert Downey Jr. and his character sidekick well-known Jude Law. Through casting lesser known actors, Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer, Richie relies more on the strength of success of his directing, the script, use of cinematography and accompanying music to bring out a wealth of comedy and appealing storyline in their performances.",/review/rw3301733/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2015,classicalsteve,8," A Smart Comedy-Thriller a Throwback to the 1960's Setting and Culture: Sort of Bond Meets Bourne
","Unlike the recent James Bonds films where 007 uses cell phones, laptops and the world wide web (the days of the lethal ballpoint pen are over), the recent film ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" relies on the sensibilities of 1960's thriller films and televisions shows as its setting and culture. Not only are the cars and the old-style phones from a bygone era present, secret agents kiss the hands of beautiful but wicked heiresses, the managers of hotels offer complimentary champagne to their guests in lavish rooms, and everyone dresses as if they just had a shopping spree, spending $1000's at Neiman Marcus. There are even a few split-screen sequences. This was the way these kinds of action films and shows were presented from circa 1956 to 1969 before the counter-culture dismissed them as being elitist. During the era, Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Sean Connery, and Diana Rigg often starred in these light-hearted entertainments which often combined action and comedy, and now three new actors have taken the reigns to offer us a recap of these films with higher budgets and high definition.",/review/rw3301733/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2015,grnwoman,10," Outstanding!
","As a long-time fan of the original series who has watched rights disputes, and cast and director changes over the years, I viewed the pre-release publicity with high hopes and low expectations. But in the end, the film itself was a wonderful surprise! Witty, light-hearted without being a spoof and dramatic without being heavy-handed. The two main characters were updated from what was allowable in 60s television to satisfying and engaging modern versions of their original incarnations, and the attendant allies and villains were all one could want. The film was very much what the series could have been were it being done now, in the era of Game of Thrones and Mad Men. I've been twice and will be going again, as well as buying the DVD. Open Channel D; this film is more than I dared hope for!",/review/rw3301733/?ref_=tt_urv
