24 March 2011,PhantomAgony,," Great Concept with Sloppy Execution & a Contrived Ending
","The concept of Limitless is fantastic - what would happen if you could take a pill (NZT) that would allow you to use 100% of your brain (instead of the standard 20%) and function on a level higher than you have ever functioned before? The possibilities for such a movie idea are well, limitless - pun intended - but unfortunately, despite some great acting, especially by Bradley Cooper, who plays Eddie Morra - the lead whose life the movie follows throughout it's duration, the film just could not overcome some major plot holes, sloppy writing and nonsensical moments.",/review/rw5040370/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2011,davejones,8," A Fun and Original Science-fiction Thriller
","This movie doesn't exactly go deep with either the moral or thematic implications of super intelligence. Nor are the characters particularly well developed. But I was engaged from beginning to end with this taut and, best of all, original thriller. I've never seen anything quite like it. It proceeds in a generally credible and suspenseful way from its premise--a pill that allows you to use all of your brain.Of course, the notion that we're only using a small fraction of our brains is untrue, but I liked how the film uses this urban fib as a springboard for its engaging story.",/review/rw5040370/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2015,Leofwine_draca,6," Fairly good, and original...
","LIMITLESS has the advantage of telling a fairly unusual story in a way that seems fresh and compelling, although there are serious problems with the narrative throughout. In essence it tells of an ordinary man - a struggling writer in New York - who comes into contact with an extraordinary drug that allows him to use 100% of his brain, rather than the 20% that the ordinary person supposedly uses.",/review/rw5040370/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2011,gradyharp,," Writer's Block: Two Forms
","LIMITLESS is a film that you want to see succeed - an idea with 'limitless' possibilities, a setting that involves Wall Street (part of our core issue of economic chaos), some interesting camera work, and a a script that likes to make puns. The problems with the film is that is underdeveloped: main characters are rather two dimensional, cameo characters are walk-on parts without much purpose, and the script, such as it is, relies on voice-over cop out instead of intelligent dialogue.

","You're not supposed to judge a book by its cover, or at least that's what authors tell us. Well motion picture directors would want you to not judge their films by the trailers or posters. Limitless is one of the few recent films to deny the misconceptions from its efficient marketing.",/review/rw5040370/?ref_=tt_urv

3 April 2011,imdb2-556-923983,8," Original, creative, enjoyable
","I feel it needs to be said that this is a superhero movie. We've had a myriad of superhero movies in recent years, but only a handful (e.g. the first Iron Man) were films where it seemed to me cast and crew were not fast asleep but actually cared about what they were doing. This is definitely an example of that rare breed. It is one of those movies where you spend the entire length of the film NOT noticing that it is a superhero movie, and quite possibly this will not dawn on you even on the ride home, because the subject matter is handled seriously: the characters are 3d life-like people; the plot has life-like complexity; there is ambiguity and room for interpretation. Somebody cared. I had my doubts, going in, whether Bradley Cooper can pull this one off. He sure can. Other actors are also at the top of their game. (I don't feel I need to pick out De Niro in particular, here.)",/review/rw5040370/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2011,TourettesPersonal,8," His Intelligence Has Its Limits
",A pill can make you smart is indeed an interesting concept but what is more interesting is the directing. It's not an ordinary thriller movie. The director gave a lot of style in this movie to make it more exciting. It definitely works and the movie is limitlessly entertaining. There are some plot holes that the filmmakers doesn't intend to fix it but still it's worth watching.,/review/rw5040370/?ref_=tt_urv

","An aspiring writer struggling with his love life, an apartment in shambles, a wasteful lifestyle and a writer's block, is left hopeless after being dumped for his ineptitude. He then stumbles upon a past acquaintance who introduces him to an experimental drug that could change his life forever. The intriguing proposition of the story centers around this pharmaceutical experiment that optimizes brain usage to 100% from the meager 20% that we normally use. The problem, that we soon discover, is that supply is limited..... and restricted.",/review/rw5040370/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2011,judywalker2,4," Ultimately limited and disappointed
","Limitless could have been a great story that highlights addiction in our society. Addiction to pharmaceuticals and to power. Here is a guy like a lot of people in our society, supposedly down and out who then is given a drug that makes him smarter. What does he do with it, well what every man in this capitalistic society would do-he finds a way to make lots of money. The story does a good job of making you feel his addiction which I guess is because of some decent acting. The problem is the ending of the movie. Everyone who has become addicted to this drug is faced with the consequences except for the principle character. This is a mistake. There are always consequences when you are addicted to something whether it be drugs or power. There are always consequences when your actions are nothing but selfish. The movie should have had the guts to show that.",/review/rw5040370/?ref_=tt_urv

11 March 2011,deborapr87,8," Definitely a fun movie!
","If you've ever found yourself staring into nothingness, wondering why you couldn't muster even a hair of energy to get up and do something, then you're going to find this movie highly satisfying. Limitless takes you on a ride... and that's not an exaggeration. The computer graphics create a glimpse into what it would actually feel like to be a ""super-you."" The writers also did a great job of creating a character that from the start... pretty much charms your pants off. Bradley Cooper actually surprised me. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he was able to honestly portray a guy that had absolutely nothing going for him and became a ""somebody."" The movie graphics, plot, and main actors (well, DeNiro, Cooper, and Johnny Whitworth) were all intriguing. It's not just a movie about what crazy things some drug can make you do... it creates a discussion within each of us, ""What if you could unlock all the potential of YOUR mind, who would you be?"" Now the downsides... some of the supporting actors were very weak. Also, there were some scenarios that went off the deep end but actually had the audience laughing hysterically so it wasn't exactly a bad thing. If you thought you'd get a deep or scientific explanation for the drug... don't hold your breath. Thankfully the plot was engaging enough that you didn't really care. The movie had some interesting ideas but some that I especially loved were the ones about identity, and about taking something to make yourself better and whether that meant you were actually you or an altered you. Does it matter even? One last thing I gotta say though, the one guy, Johnny Whitworth, did a really great job. I hope he gets some major roles in the future because I think he's very talented.

20 March 2011,ferguson-6,5," Crystal Clear, Except when it's not
","Greetings again from the darkness. First, I absolutely love this premise. The idea that, by taking a pill, we can simultaneously access all parts of our brain and process information at hyper-speed is fascinating, and a terrific idea for a movie. As it turns out, that terrific premise loses much luster when the center of action is a egomaniacal, smirking doofus played by a strutting Bradley Cooper.",/review/rw5040370/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2011,zetes,3," Insanely stupid
","Truly putrid thriller starring the ""sexiest man alive"" Bradley Cooper. The dude can't act worth a crap, but even if he could, he couldn't save the film from such an enormously stupid screenplay. It's about a dunderhead (Cooper) who is given a magic clear pill by his ex-brother-in-law that allows him to use his full brain capacity. The pill makes him so smart that he's able to play the stock market and get rich quick - of course, he's so smart that the way he gets funding to play the stock market is by borrowing from the Russian mafia. Because that's what smart people would do. Later in the film, Cooper's girlfriend (Abbie Cornish, whose career should be going much better than it is - she stars in two of the worst films of the year, this and Sucker Punch) takes the pill and decides to use an eight year old girl with ice skates as a weapon. The thing is, the writers of this film (and the original novel; this was based on a friggin' novel!) are so dumb they don't have any clue how a smart person would think, so they just come up with whatever is in their dumbass heads and put it in the movie. Co-starring Rober De Niro.",/review/rw5040370/?ref_=tt_urv

","There is something a little Twilight Zone-ish about the plot involving a drug which allows full access to memories, enhanced learning and seemingly impossibly powerful abilities to do anything humanly possible, but has a fixed life and potentially fatal side effects. This film uses special effects which are stunningly clever and often a little nauseating and the story line is full of clever twists and turns because it is concentrating on what really may happen if such an event occurred. From that perspective it is excellent.",/review/rw5040370/?ref_=tt_urv
