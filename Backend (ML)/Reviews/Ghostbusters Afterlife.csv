2 December 2021,Coventry,8," What it feels like to be nine years old again!
","About ten months before the release of ""Ghostbusters: Afterlife"", and without any knowledge whatsoever that a belated sequel was in production, I re-watched the 1984 original for the first time in 25 years, and together with own kids (aged six and ten). Needless to say, my offspring wasn't the least bit impressed with special effects from the early eighties, and to be totally honest, I found that my childhood favorite had badly dated as well.",/review/rw7722492/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2021,Sleepin_Dragon,8," Surprisingly good.
","I'll be honest, after the last Ghostbusters movie, I wasn't keen on it, reluctantly I went along, and have to admit, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It feels like a worthy successor to the original film, it doesn't just ignore the past, it supports it. I would advise seeing the original movie ahead of this, as there is a lot of nostalgia surrounding it. I feel like they wanted it to respect the original, that it does.",/review/rw7722492/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2021,lareval,8," Finally!! A movie that's worthy of the legacy of the first two!
","The first 'Ghostbusters' is one of the most beloved movies of my childhood. The second one gets critized sometimes but I think it's as good as the first. Let's forget that embarrassing awful movie that took place in the 2010's and finally focus on this one: THE TRUEST THIRD MOVIE OF 'GHOSTBUSTERS'. I had no hype for this one (mostly because of the trainwreck that out-of-place-2010's movie), but I felt somewhat compelled to give the benefit of the doubt and realise if my fears were right or wrong... I'll tell you this: watch this movie!",/review/rw7722492/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2021,UniqueParticle,9," That hit the spot especially in RPX
","I absolutely loved this Ghostbusters definitely better than 2016 mess! This has everything you'd want in the series with comedy, amazing cinematography, great story I even went with a friend and he noticed a few plot holes I didn't even realize it had some; I think everything was the way it should be. So much exciting bits that are feel good and has the perfect amount of surprises. I'm glad I got to see the advanced screening and I really hope the film gets the recognition it deserves!",/review/rw7722492/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2021,kosmasp,9," Ghostbusters the next Generation
","I have to admit I had certain expectations and thought about seeing certain people/characters in this. Let's say if I was just rating the movie based on that, I probably would have rated it lower. I also missed out on the opportunity to rewatch the first two movies. But I don't think it would have mattered that much. Even a female character that had a small cameo in here, I sort of remembered her (small) part in the original movies.",/review/rw7722492/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2021,Calicodreamin,7," Worthy successor
","This reboot of sorts did it all right in terms of being respectful to the original, maintaining a plausible storyline, and having awesome cameos. The story was a bit slow to develop but had some cool moments and a lot of small laughs. All of this proudly sponsored by Walmart.",/review/rw7722492/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2021,garethvk,9," Ghostbusters Afterlife Is A Winning Entry In The Series And One Of The Most Enjoyable Films Of The Year
","Back in 1984 when big hair and neon were the norms; a movie appeared that soon became a cultural phenomenon. The movie involved a team of unlikely Paranormal Investigators and the mix of comedy, FX, and Ghosts turned the movie into a smash hit and a Pop Culture mainstay. The abundance of products that followed and the inescapable theme song and tagline soon gave rise to a sequel which while a success; did not resonate the way the original film had and thus the ""Ghostbusters"" film franchise became dormant.",/review/rw7722492/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2021,GT-Lar,8," Ghostbusters: afterlife........ 7.5/10
","Massive fan of the original and the sequel was good too , i did not like the remake from a few years ago , but this is a very good watch , take the kids or just go yourself for a bit of nostalgia .....!!!!!!!",/review/rw7722492/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2021,sinnerofcinema,10," FANS REJOICE! coming from a die hard Ghostbusters fan, this is EXACTLY what we were waiting for. an event film
","Ive been waiting for this movie for two years. So my expectation were at another level. I had the pleasure to attend the advance screening and I have never experience anything like this. This movie, with its die hard following, make the viewing experience an event film. The energy was electrifying from begining to the last credit. And everyone stayed to take pictures of each other. Its exactly the movie we needed to continue the Ghostbuster legacy.",/review/rw7722492/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2021,george.schmidt,8," Reitman's valentine to the original comedy horror classic will make you feelin' good.
","GHOSTBUSTERS: AFTERLIFE (2021) *** Carrie Coon, Paul Rudd, Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, Logan Kim, Celeste O' Connor, Bill Murray, Dany Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, Sigourney Weaver, JK Simmons, Olivia Wilde. (voices of : Josh Gad & Shohreh Aghdashloo). Filmmaker Jason Reitman, son of executive producer and director of the original comedy horror classic, returns the franchise true to form in this valentine to the team of paranormal exterminators with the Spengler family retiring to their estranged paterfamilias Egon (the late, great Harold Ramis) where his granddaughter (Grace, in a winning and often uncanny turn as the famed comedian) discovers her grandfather's plans to stop the return of Gozer the Gozarian to return for another shot at destroying the world, while in the process of uniting her family in their new Mid-west environs. Reitman, who co-wrote with Gil Kenan the chock block of Easter eggs screenplay that wisely incorporates its source material with its new cast (the weight of the legacy rests well on the slender yet able shoulders of Grace, the heart of the film). Fun mix of visuals and much welcomed extended cameos make for a heckuva night at the cineplex.",/review/rw7722492/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2021,rallder19,6," It was entertaining
","Much better than the reboot but doesn't even come close to the first 2. The original had a very ""flavorful"" cast and I think that's what made them so good. Like, had they cast this crew in the original films I highly doubt they would have been as good as they are.",/review/rw7722492/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2022,Camoo,2," Painful
","I was the kid who dressed up as a Ghostbuster every year on Halloween, saved up pennies for the action figures, proton pack and the glow-in-the-dark trap, and begged my parents to bring me to the sequel even though I ended up having recurring nightmares of Janosz's glowing eyeballs. I cherished those movies, and Afterlife seems geared exactly toward my particular level of obsessive fandom.",/review/rw7722492/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2022,Xstal,8," Once a Ghostbuster, Always a Ghostbuster...
","If you like the supernatural, the weird and ghostly paranormal, often fantasise of phantoms, apparitions hold you ransom; if you're looking for some fun, using spectral shooting guns, blitzing wraith-like demon dogs, into ectoplasmic fog; if you're a little sentimental, got the VHS as rental, remember 1984, did your thing on the dance floor; who you gonna recall, spend two hours having a ball, guaranteed to make you smile, busting ghosts with such great style.",/review/rw7722492/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2021,masonsaul,9," Incredibly heartfelt reboot
","Ghostbusters: Afterlife is an incredibly heartfelt reboot that's extremely heartwarming, emotional and funny whilst treating the original with respect. It also has plenty of satisfying callbacks, even if it's narrative is basically the same as the original.",/review/rw7722492/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2021,zardoz-13,8," The Original Ghostbusters are Back!
","Not only does the ""Ghostbusters"" sequel reboot ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" (*** out of ****) recapture the whimsical hilarity of the original movies, but it also amounts to a family affair. Jason Reitman, who co-wrote and directed ""Ghostbusters Afterlife,"" is Ivan Reitman's son, and Ivan directed the two Bill Murray ""Ghostbusters"" movies. Furthermore, Ivan also served as a producer on the reboot. Apart from Harold Ramis, who died at age 69 in 2014, and Rick Moranis (alive but retired), everybody else reprises their original roles. Despite quibbles, ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" is more faithful to the franchise than the previous, uninspired, gender-flipped ""Ghostbusters"" (2016). Jason Reitman has kept the family legacy intact with ""Ghostbusters Afterlife."" Anybody who enjoyed the supernatural shenanigans of the first (though not necessarily the second) ""Ghostbusters"" should relish this reboot. Reitman and co-scenarist Gil Kenan provide airtight continuity between ""Ghostbusters 2"" (1989) and ""Ghostbusters Afterlife."" A refreshing, young, first-rate cast, lighthearted CGI visual effects, and polished production values distinguish this 124-minute, PG-13 rated franchise update. The Reitmans have shown good taste in their reverential treatment of the Harold Ramis character. Appropriately, they portray Dr. Egon Spengler as an apparition now rather than an actual person. Don't rush for the exits when the end credits roll or you'll miss deleted footage of Harold Ramis from the 1984 ""Ghostbusters."" One of the delights of ""Ghostbusters Afterlife"" is neither Kenan nor Reitman have tampered with the backstory of the franchise.",/review/rw7722492/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2022,racoonito,5," Not good sadly
",The movie is cringe acting is ok. Just another franchise that makes children the hero which I honestly don't like. Felt like an average dc movie. Sadly did not get me one bit. Paul Rudd was easily the best part of the movie. The trailer made it look like Paul Rudd was starring but he was barely in the movie. I am really disappointed.,/review/rw7722492/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2021,hans-vdc,9," A pleasant surprise!
","Just saw the movie in avant-premiere here in Belgium. Had a blast, and my daughters (11 and 17) really loved it. Sure, there's quite a bit of fan-service but I was very happy to see they kept the style of the previous movies, it has a dash of The Goonies combined with the charm of the 80's movies and the ending is just great. Really did not expect it to be this good, but man am I happy they did what they did. Great movie, just plain good fun like in the good old days. Go see it!",/review/rw7722492/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,silverpinkcity,1," Boring, Cliche, Pandering to Nostalgia, and yea. Just Boring.
","Wow, was I underwhelmed. I thought I would be watching a comedy...like the original two Ghostbusters. I thought I would (imagine this!) actually laugh! But...no. I just felt like I couldn't wait for this movie to be over, which is not a good feeling.",/review/rw7722492/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2022,Her-Excellency,6," Unboolievably Mediocre
","This started off REALLY well, and in fact, seemed to peel back a layer of the Ghostbuster's franchise to reveal a more solid, deeper, almost horror-y story. Then, at around 3/4's of the way through, it all went to hell. It seemed almost as if the ghost of the screenwriter had written the ending.",/review/rw7722492/?ref_=tt_urv
