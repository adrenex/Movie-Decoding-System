23 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," ""There's no crying in baseball!""
","A League of their Own, another classic movie that I grew up with. I have to admit it, I'm a girl, I totally fell in love with this movie. But I'm one of the rare girls that loves baseball with a passion, I was raised in a very baseball oriented family, we live in Chicago, we kinda have to enjoy sports, lol. But growing up you wonder why baseball, football, basketball are more for the boys vs. the girls, girls can play but are not famous for it and if they are an athlete are accused of being manly. It's a tough world, but when I was 7 years old A League of their Own was released in theaters, my family saw this movie together and my life changed. Sounds silly, but this was the movie that reminded me to stay strong, at the time when women were expected to stay in the kitchen, as hard as they had to work for it, there was a women's baseball league during WWII. A League of their Own explores this hard but extremely fun time for the girls of the All American Baseball League.",/review/rw1006726/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2004,JamesHitchcock,7," Entertaining look at an obscure piece of sporting history
","Like most Englishmen, I know about as much about baseball as the average American knows about cricket. I am also not a great fan of sporting films in general, although there are a number of exceptions. Despite this, however, I generally love baseball films, of which there were a number of good examples in the late eighties and early nineties. ('Eight Men Out', 'Field of Dreams' and 'The Natural' all spring to mind). There is something about the sport that seems to lend itself to the cinema; perhaps British filmmakers should consider making a film about cricket, as the two sports have a lot in common.

24 March 2002,SmileysWorld,8," A fitting,funny tribute
","Little did I know as a child that a professional women's baseball league even existed.That just goes to prove what little recognition these ladies have gotten over the years.This film finally pushes them over the top in terms of getting that recognition.Excellent perception and direction by Penny Marshall here in recreating this long ago time;a time of war when the nation needed the simple pleasures of life more than ever,to help them escape,at least temporarily,the horrors of the goings on overseas.With most of the male professional ball players overseas,our beloved women were called upon to fill the void,and boy did they ever fill it!It makes me wish, in some ways,that I could have been there to see it all.A fine comic performance here by Tom Hanks,as Jimmy Dugan, the somewhat reluctant and ignorant(at least,at first) manager of the Rockford Peaches. Outstanding performances as well from Madonna,Rosie O'Donnell,Geena Davis,and Lori Petty.A finer tribute could not have been made.Well done.",/review/rw1006726/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2015,AlsExGal,9," Never waste time, never waste an opportunity
","I watched this film for the nth time after many times as part of the ""Trailblazing Women"" series on Turner Classic Movies. After watching the Rosie the Riveter documentary, it really stands out how much women were ""used"" during World War II. They were told how important they were to the war effort. What wasn't emphasized was the transient nature of the situation, that it was ""until the men come back"", so they got used to doing something other than housework if they were married or pretty mind numbing low paying jobs if they were not. The women working in the factories during the war had good paying jobs and some independence for the first times in their lives, the same with the girls in this movie. They not only had good pay, but a place in the limelight, doing something they were good at doing - baseball - with crowds rooting for them, but like Dottie and Kit, they had just been playing as amateurs pre-War. Dottie doesn't want to join the league at first. What Kit says is true - Dotty is the prettier sister, the sister with more baseball talent, and she doesn't want to admit her own competitive spirit until she is given a chance to exercise it, and then that competitiveness somewhat scares her. Tom Hanks is brilliant as Jimmy Dugan, a washed up ball player who drank away the five best years of his career and is recruited to coach the Rockford Peaches. At first he doesn't take this job seriously, but time, a few verbal bouts with Dottie, and a growing attachment to the girls change that. Towards the end of the film he delivers one of the best monologues that I have ever heard about talent, opportunities lost, and the fact that certain moments never come again. I know somebody else wrote these lines, but he delivered them with heart. One line should be emblazoned on everybody's mind - ""If it wasn't hard everyone would do it. The hard is what makes it great."" Don't run away from anything because it is hard.",/review/rw1006726/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2001,Drewboy-2,10," What a wonderful film!
","I love this film!  Seeing Geena Davis, Lori Petty, Rosie O'Donnell and Madonna in one film is fantastic.  Having it directed by Penny Marshall makes it all the better.  After I watched it, for some strange reason I felt I'd watched an extended episode of ""Laverne & Shirley"" but this is great for the comedy!",/review/rw1006726/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2002,tfrizzell,," Pleasant Experience.
","""A League of Their Own"" tells a story that is rarely discussed in historical circles. The country is immersed in World War II and it is up to the women to keep professional baseball going. The film follows the sometimes rocky relationship between two sisters (Geena Davis and Lori Petty) who go from a small town in the midwest to the major leagues. Tom Hanks does outstanding work as the former player who now manages their team. Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell are among the other girls on the team who keep Hanks on his toes. Penny Marshall's direction is very solid here and she tells the story with a dignified style and grace that works well on the silver screen. A very good comedy-drama from the early-1990s. 4 stars out of 5.",/review/rw1006726/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2021,Med-Jasta,10," Perfect movie
",Everything about this movie is executed perfectly. The comedy is funny and isn't forced. The drama is real but not heavy. It's about two serious subjects but the message is in the subtext and doesn't hit you over the head.,/review/rw1006726/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2006,rebeljenn,6," a good film for a wide audience
","'A League of Their Own' is a film about an all-female baseball team during the second World War. This film follows the stories about the team of females and their perspective on life and society (as women) during this time in history. I am not a fan of sports or sport-related films, but I did enjoy this one. I think that this film had enough elements for a wider audience to enjoy it. It also is able to combine comedy with drama and history, and it makes an exciting and engaging film with characters that are three-dimension and easy to care about. I think that this is an exciting film, and even if you dislike sports, the film has plenty more to offer for any viewer.",/review/rw1006726/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2006,nycritic,9," When Women Took a Sports and Made it Theirs
","Unless you're a history buff you may not know that there was a women's baseball league -- the All American Girls' Professional Baseball League, formed in 1943 -- and while the men were away fighting the war in Europe these women kept the spirit alive by playing an game that has become part of Americana. Itself a sports version of SWING SHIFT, A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN is a sentimental journey back in time to when all this was taking place and it seemed that women would also claim this as their own sports in a male-dominated world. (They didn't, but it was good while it lasted.)",/review/rw1006726/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2006,rull_cl,10," For me, a very beautiful and inspiring movie
","Despite the fact of this movie was exhibited on screens in 1992 or 93, I've just saw it on TV in my country only a few days ago. In fact, it isn't the first time it is exhibited, but for one reason or other I've never had seen it. And I've to say that ""A League Of Their Own"" really touched me. In my country, unlike other Latinamerican like Venezuela, Puerto Rico and -- if I'm not wrong -- Cuba, baseball isn't a popular game, like soccer or tennis. It's played only in some clubs by American citizens or Chilean who lived in the U.S. and learned to play and love it. However, for me the ignorance of the baseball rules is not important, but the fact of that the subjects treated in this movie are universal: fight for a dream and achieve it, solidarity (how beautiful the scene when one of the players teaches to read the one who doesn't know, using a ""little hot"" short-novel), friendship, hope, dignity and the spirit of trying to be always better. From now on, this movie has become one of my favorites, with some other like ""Steel Magnolias"" and ""Fried Green Tomatoes"". Beautiful ones, inspiring, with no-violence and giving a positive message good for our spirits, no matter the zone of the world where you live because, like I've already said, its message is universal: the hope on reaching your dreams and be a better person. And I think that it's marvelous in a world like the present, that sometimes turns so hard to live in. I believe also that it isn't necessary to be American or have had friends or relatives involved in a terrible conflict like the 2nd W.W. to understand this movie. Finally, I'm sorry for my not good English and, if possible, I beg from someone who had had the patience to read this lines up to this point, some additional information about the female baseball league of the United States. I will appreciate it, really. And friendly greetings from Chile, proudly the world's southernmost country!!. (and very friendly with foreigners, too. Visit us, we're waiting for you!!)",/review/rw1006726/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2010,bkoganbing,9," A Home Run
","The story of the women's professional baseball league after almost 40 years after the last game was played comes to the big screen with A League Of Their Own. Though the names are changed and the facts are jumbled, A League Of Their Own celebrates what was a milestone in the feminist movement.

29 August 2021,ElMaruecan82,9," A nostalgic trip into a nostalgia-driven movie...
","Penny Marshall's ""A League Of Their Own"" is one of these 90s gems that didn't need 'greatness' to become classics. Those were the days where you could make a film about the pioneering Female Baseball League during WW2, basically a feminist story, and yet without the typical battle-of-sexes agenda that became our millennium's trend: the closest to male antagonists are a stupid heckler and a rich sponsor (played effectively by the director's brother Garry Marshall) who believes there would be no place for women on the big diamond once the boys return from the front.",/review/rw1006726/?ref_=tt_urv

Scout Ernie Capadino (Jon Lovitz) comes to find new talents. He's interested in Dottie but not her sister Kit Keller (Lori Petty). He only takes Kit after Dottie agrees to come. It's a slow start and the girls have the drunken ex-player Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks) as their manager. Then Dottie becomes a star and the league begins to be successful.

","I can truly watch this movie over and over again and still be inspired by it. I think it shows just what women are capable of. If u haven't seen it i strongly recommend it. It remains at the top of my list and i've seen many award winning movies. It is filled with an amazing cast. It will make u cry and the best part is that there are some true facts. There was this league of women made after most male baseball players had gone to fight in the war. There's romance, fighting, comedy, and some dancing. I mean it has everything a movie needs to be enjoyable. Believe me it wont be a waste of time. You can watch this movie with family and friends.",/review/rw1006726/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2005,jobennett86,10," Penny Marshall's Absolute Home Run
","I am not a movie-goer. I watch everything on video or cable. I have seen League of Their Own no less than 50 times, and each time, I'm delighted and amazed at the comedic thought and timing that Penny Marshall put into this movie. This is the only movie that I can quote verbatim during the dialogue. Such gems as when Jimmy Dugan asks why the bus stopped, then ""Betty Spaghetti"" informs him that ""Lou quit."" Dugan screams, ""Who's Lou?!"" And on another Dugan rant, when Rosie O'Donnell's character mumbles, ""Is that English?"" The expression on the scout's face when he sees how, er, plain-looking Marla looks. His explanation that he has to go home after dropping his recruits off for tryouts, because he needs to shower, shave, and ""give the wife some pickle tickle."" Beyond the funny, fine performances, though, this film has a sweet sadness that makes it real. In the end, these former professional athletes who made it to their golden years come back to be honored in the Baseball Hall of Fame and play in a virtual homecoming game. They all look pretty much like the grandma who you love or who lives down the street from you, but you know that they're women who were brought together because they all had the guts, determination and talent to change the face of American sports.",/review/rw1006726/?ref_=tt_urv

28 August 2007,moonspinner55,6," Plastic nostalgia...but Geena Davis and Lori Petty are perfectly cast
","A present-day reunion of WWII-era women's league baseball players that brings back fond memories of America's Golden Era to the now-aged ladies who blazed the trail. Director Penny Marshall's nostalgic valentine to war-time tomboys puts the squeeze on us right from the start (with elderly actress Lynn Cartwright dubbed with Geena Davis' voice, to ill effect). Marshall wants to make sure we don't miss any of her hat-tricks, some of which (including a urination gag) that misfire completely. The cast of high-spirited gals (and Tom Hanks as their coach) are alternately lively, wonderful and excruciating. Rosie O'Donnell is a real chore stomping about on the field, but Geena Davis and Lori Petty (as competitive sisters) are genuinely charming, shrewdly cast and nearly flawless (a movie about them alone would be worth watching). The film isn't nearly as hearty as it wants to be (it has a mechanical engine driving it), but the put-on sentiment may hook some. Madonna's supporting performance is one of her least self-conscious, and she contributes a moving song, ""This Used to Be My Playground"". **1/2 from ****",/review/rw1006726/?ref_=tt_urv
