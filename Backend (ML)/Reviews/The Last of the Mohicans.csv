","The absolutely gorgeous Indian actress Lisa Ray (Vancouver critics named her Best Actress for Water) plays Tala, an upper class Jordanian of Palestinian origin, whose family lives in London, and who is about to get married.",/review/rw7859706/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2008,DeciusCaius,9," A lighthearted movie with real substance
","I recently saw this movie screened at USC. Since I was going for extra credit in a gender studies class, I expected it to be awful. I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. The only issue I had with it was an awkward transition from Tala's engagement party to the first scene with Leyla. Overall, the movie was very entertaining, with well developed characters and plot, while at the same time dealing with the issues lesbians face in different cultures in a very effective manner. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind and a sense of humor.",/review/rw7859706/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2008,opencad2,10," A happy romance . . .
","This is an interesting film from a variety of perspectives. It addresses sexuality as well as issues of middle eastern faith and culture. Light hearted though it is, it shows several cultures few have seen from the inside out. Modern Britain plays host to many cultures of middle eastern descent. And the stereotype of ""angry fathers"" and ""downtrodden women"" is a commonly repeated meme. This film shows strong women, compassionate men and loving families. Filmed in Britain, with very few imported actors, one sees a cross section of cultures working together to produce a good project. This is a great film to take almost anyone to.",/review/rw7859706/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2009,little_miss_dolphin8,10," Awesome film!
","Amazing. I loved it so much. The two main actresses were fantastic, very talented young women. The chemistry between the two of them was phenomenal. The suspense they created just held you right there, watching the film and unable to turn away. Moving from Jordan to England, the settings created a background to an incredibly unique film not only about coming out but also about religion, family and culture. It was pretty much just a wonderfully unique film, that gave an entirely new perspective on things and that should be applauded over and over again. The characters were hilarious- all of them. From the maid, to sisters to boyfriends and parents, all the characters complemented each other perfectly and the entire film had me laughing and crying the entire time. Absolutely fantastic!!",/review/rw7859706/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2008,kieranwy,9," A good representation of lesbianism in culture.
","I enjoyed 'I Can't Think Straight' (which i think is a very clever title indeed given the content of the film). It raises the issue of lesbianism but in the context of Indian culture. Arranged marriages and a mother who is wanting to marry you off to the most suitable husband. Usually the man who comes from the most prestigious family, who is very successful, tall, very hansom, etc. All because the mother of the family wanting to marry off their daughter wants to gain some financial security and prestige for the family. (Or at least this is how it has been portrayed to me in the film). But what about if the daughter is gay? Much harder to imagine I feel, and 'I Can't Think Straight' portrays this matter very well. The movie is full of alluring cinematography and well constructed dialogue. Particularly I found, when the characters of Lisa Ray and Sheetal Sheth go for their ramble in the park. This is an especially elegant scene but the whole film screams decoration and harmony. The acting from the main characters is spot on and they must have received clear direction from Shamim Sarif. Some of the minor character's acting is quite poor and does not do justice to the script. but on the whole, it makes little difference to the story.",/review/rw7859706/?ref_=tt_urv

19 August 2011,benbree,," Are these women acting?
","Wow! This is a great movie. I felt the actors were actually having this relationship. They dealt with conflict, misunderstanding, and love as if it was something they actually shared. While the premise was a lesbian relationship, this could happen to anyone.",/review/rw7859706/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2012,ninamarcelino,9," Gorgeous, funny and sexy.
","I have always thought this movie would be funny and quirky, and it is. I loved the way they put comedic scenes in certain parts without being inappropriate. I loved it even more because in so many ways, I also find it extremely sexy (unlike the many other lesbian films that needed to show pure nudity). Although it might be one of the many I'm-gonna-marry-but-I- fell-in-love-with-another story, it hit off just right. 'Cause it did not just focus about that, but having to come up to your parents. It is about standing for who you are and for the one you love.",/review/rw7859706/?ref_=tt_urv

28 September 2012,christianhh,10," Highly Enjoyable Love Story
","If this were simply a story about your average, every day, star crossed lovers, one might describe it as a ""chick flick"". It is a romance with some comedic elements, but I doubt it can honestly be called a ""romantic comedy"". Instead, it is a rather simple love story that, toward the end, threatens to leave the viewer hanging. The characterizations by the two lead actresses is stunning and highly believable. They do not play their roles over the top, but in a somewhat subdued manner that is consistent with the behavior of women from their respective cultures. Even so, Tala (played by Lisa Ray) is something of a maverick in her opinions, outlook and something of a problem for her family even before she meets Layla. I fell in love with both the characters early in the film and they took me on an enjoyable ride.",/review/rw7859706/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2009,bob the moo,," ""Nice"" but the potential isn't really realised due to a clunky script and some wooden performances
","While I'm sure that the vast majority of male viewers of this film will have come to it because of how easy on the eye the two lead actresses are, but for me I came to it because I had heard that it was a quite charming little film about culture clashes and coming out. From the outset there is certainly a degree of charm that comes with the rather glossy sheen on the total production and certainly the performances are mostly geared towards ""light"" material rather than anything too complex. It also, having an autobiographical content, comes over as warmly sympathetic to the two protagonists â€“ a feeling that it easily allows the viewer to share. However, none of this is enough to make it as good as it could have been, mainly because of the problems with the material.",/review/rw7859706/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2014,elisa-matteoni,7," Love story
","Unbelievable how a love story can intrigue so much. A tale about love, cheaters, envy and different cultures that give director Shamim Sharif's competitors a hard time. By the musics, costumes and make-up it is possible to go through the way of life of two young Middle Eastern women who decided to follow their real feeling in contempt of the consequencies of their actions and decisions. At the same time we can appreciate the unexpected open-minded behaviour of the characters in the movie. Both young and old people accept the condition of things and try to understand the passion that tie Tala and Leyla. A women love story.",/review/rw7859706/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2014,s-p-aulisa,," one of nicest comedy ever!
","If you want to spend 90 minutes of enjoyable relax alone or with your friends, you should watch ""I can't think straight"", based on same name novel. It is the story of two women who, after they met, they understood much more about their selves. This is not only a love story, it is the story of two different cultures that blend and mix: Tala comes from Jordan and Leyla comes from Palestina, while magnificent London is the best background for this love affair. There is a strong recall to Bollywood cinematography (music, costumes, characters), as a sort of homage to director's biography. The story comes also along quite quickly, so you can't be bored. This is why there are a lot of romantic and passionate scenes, but also many funny situations which joke some Indian stereotypes.",/review/rw7859706/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2015,Irishchatter,9," So much to say about this film!
",I just seen this movie on youtube and it really shows how conservative people can be when it comes to coming out as a homosexual person. Like its ridiculous and heartbreaking. I thought both fathers were so supportive then the mothers. The mothers made it into a huge big deal like seriously! They should wake up! ,/review/rw7859706/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2020,Woman_it_up,10," Heads over heals for this
","I know some people don't think highly of the movie, but...
This is a movie containing a lot of representation. It shows LGBT, biracial, bi-cultural conflict. And it doesn't stop there, it seams to me that the writer have poured all her heart into it, so it feels cozy to watch. It feels magical. I am not a person who reread or re watch, but this movie was an exception. I have watched it 4 times, and read the book, but I still feel giddy about it.",/review/rw7859706/?ref_=tt_urv

17 April 2020,w-08323,7," Not bad
","The Hong Kong translation of the film, ""The Beautiful Girl Doesn't Come Straight"" is more interesting, but it is a pity that the film is like a castle in the air.It is not very convincing that two rich Middle Eastern daughters who emigrated to Britain dare not come out of the closet despite their parents'opposition to religion, and that a Muslim who obeys his parents dares to come out of the closet.It was a short rhetorical question about religion that was interesting. The two heroines are the kind of beautiful Ji guy, at least pleasing to the eye.",/review/rw7859706/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2015,ccidica,10," I love watching it over and over again...
","This movie reminds me of how to be in love again. Not only because I am also a lesbian but the way the story was created, from beginning to end, I really feel the connection of the characters and the situation. Even though this film was created years ago, it can still be a useful tool to send out the message of the story today. I want to express my gratitude to the makers of this film for reminding me of how it feels again. Not all may understand the way it ends but everyone can relate why that is the ending. Though beliefs of different communities (gay, lesbians, or straight) may interfere on how they judge the movie, but this film shows a clear message of what is important for everyone. It's just so sad that not everyone gets to watch this film because I would absolutely recommend this to be shown around the world (excluding to the countries/communities against this belief).",/review/rw7859706/?ref_=tt_urv

6 August 2015,realisimone,," Really Amazing
","I can't think straight is an exciting comedy, telling the story of two girls in love. The movie is in each part unexpected and surprising. There are a lot of twists that leave the spectator astonished. The history of love telling about the 2 protagonists is romantic, sexy, and heart-warming, Is also very compelling and put the spectator in the shoes of the protagonist let him hope in an happy end. Lisa Ray is playing the part of the predator ( the opposite of the world Unseen) and I have to say that her interpretation is fantastic, and that the part she plays suit to her perfectly. Curious is the personal relationship between Tala and her parents, the mother plays the role of hypocrisy and selfishness thinking what is better for the image of the family whereas the father is more focused on daughter. The Role of Leyla is really curious too, Sheetal Sheth is perfectly representing her character. I suggest absolutely to see this film for have a relaxing and exciting break from the ordinary life.",/review/rw7859706/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film is light hearted and visually appealing. Though the dialogue could have been better, it was a good attempt. Sadly, women from such cultures often pay a heavy price for being true to themselves. I didn't think the family's reactions were realistic. Some families disown their kids and even punish them with honor killings, even in the West.",/review/rw7859706/?ref_=tt_urv
