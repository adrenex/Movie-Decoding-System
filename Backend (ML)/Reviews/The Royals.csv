21 December 2004,philip_vanderveken,8," An hilarious American view on Europe
","First of all: Greetings from a guy living somewhere in between the Brussels sprouts, hahahaha. That's right, I'm from Belgium, you know the place that no-one really knows, not even the Europeans...",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2004,oshram-3,9," Much much funnier than you would ever expect
","I know, I know, the trailer looks supremely dumb, so why go see this movie? Certainly not because it was from the people who gave us such gems as Road Trip or Old School, that's for sure, and it's not like I even recognized anyone in the cast (other than Michelle Trachtenberg, best known as Buffy's little sister Dawn). I guess I went because I found the trailer mildly amusing and I still had $9 on an AMC gift card that I had been given for Christmas. I've seen movies with less provocation, I suppose.",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2007,MrVibrating,," A small classic for us Europeans
","Comedies like this is hard to rate. It's a bad movie, technically, acting-wise and in many other aspects. But it's funny, no denying that. After all, isn't that what comedies are about?",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2019,tarynkstilwell,8," A cult classic at this point
","Eurotrip may have been panned by critics, but most of my millennial friends hold it up as a classic raunch-com. It is truly hilarious. And you can't help but walk away from watching it while singing ""Scotty doesn't know...""",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv

17 August 2004,Killa_Cam,8," Excellent Absurd Comedy: Funnier Than American Pie
","This movie is hilarious & a must see for those who like American Pie, Scary Movie, Senseless & similar types of comedies. Eurotrip uses almost every single cliché or stereotype regarding Europe & exaggerates it enormously in an unbelievably funny way.",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2006,gala0008,9," Fun Flick but not for the Family
","Prior to watching this movie for the first time, my friends would not stop quoting this movie and telling me how great it was. Now that I've seen it I can see why they love it so much. I will admit that this film is extremely raunchy and even shows some images I didn't think were allowed in R-rated movies. Never-the-less the jokes are hilarious and the plot flows rather smoothly.",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2014,A_Different_Drummer,8," ""scotty doesn't know"" ""worst twins ever""
","Unlike the typical movie goer, reviewers are acutely aware that films WHICH MAY SEEM UNREMARKABLE at the time of release can improve, like wine, with age.",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2020,sarareljic-07467,10," Definitely you should watch
","The movie that made me laugh sooo many times. It is just ICONIC. I don't get the 6.6,taught it should be rated better. It is little bit about stereotypes so I guess People are maybe little bit mad about it but hey,I'm ftom Europe and I loved the movie!",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2007,mjw2305,8," Brilliantly funny view of Europe from the US
","EuroTrip takes a group of teenagers from the US on an unforgettable trip around Europe. After Scotty Thomas realises he has made a terrible mistake, he and his best friend set off to put things right and they run into some other friends in the process.",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2018,dtriantafyllides,9," Mi scusi for liking this comedy.
","Most negative reviews seem to miss the point that the movie is not making stereotypes of European countries and cultures. It is making fun of American stereotypes of those cultures. While most comedies start funny and at some point get serious with a need for a plot that loses all the humor, EuroTrip keeps building momentum throughout. Watch it, and then watch it again.",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2004,bburns,7," Favorite guilty pleasure of 2004
","Okay, I admit it. Sometimes I enjoy dumb comedies, like ""Police Academy"" or ""Joe's Apartment"". And this is nothing if not a dumb comedy.",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2021,kosmasp,7," Bad Trip (?)
","First things first: do watch the ""unrated"" cut if you want to watch this at all. And there are reasons to watch this. The really enthusiastic cast to name but one ... and the silly yet engaging dialog. The interesting thing is that even if you only watch the normal cut, in the end credits they do show outtakes ... which include material from the unrated cut ... and therefor make this kind of pointless ... but whatever makes the MPAA happy I reckon.",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2006,ingwio_vanhaecke,9," Great Comedy
","OK, most people will say, it's a comedy, let's rate it low, HELL NO! This is one of these rare good comedy's. Road Trip wasn't as good as this one. Scotty doesn't know is an instant classic. Nice change of scenery for Kristin Kreuk even though she just appears briefly. Scott Mechlowicz continues the good performance he had set in Mean Creek, not to be compared of course, but good performances in both. Michelle Trachtenberg is simply fabulous,she amazes me every time, except in crappy movies like Ice Princess or in ""Buffy"". She shows she can act in Mysterious skin, but just throws her talent away further down the line. As for the story, it's nothing special, title says it all. The only country they miss is Belgium :). It's a comedy people and yes, it's for teens, not a family movie if you want to hear it. You know what you get when you see it, so stop giving bad reviews about this! Simply amazing comedy if you like these kind of comedy's. And please don't go comparing it to American Pie or something like that. Guess that's all there is to say",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2006,Flagrant-Baronessa,7," This is cheesy, cliché and predictable teen-comedy at its best.
","Every now and then comes a teen-comedy in which the plot and plot twists are so predictable that they drag the whole movie down. This is not one of those, because while Eurotrip is certainly cliché, it is simultaneously hilarious and well worth the watch. The film has some very cheesy moments and within the first ten minutes you will probably be able to guess who ends up with whom in the end and which character goes through the biggest development.

11 November 2019,acedj,8," Sassy and funny
","The short synopsis of this film is a case of mistaken gender identity, guy thinks German pen-pal is a guy and turns out to be a girl, leads to a group of friends going to Europe to try to find her. Hilarity ensues. This film is flush with humor and i always find something new at which to laugh. There is not a lot of character development or plot in this, however it is quite funny. The main song that end up being a running joke throughout the movie is even catchy.",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2007,bob the moo,," The sheer silliness of it just about makes up for how dumb, simple and occasionally offensive it is
","Dumped by his girlfriend and humiliated by her very public cheating, Scott gets drunk and overreacts to a small bit of email friendliness from his male German penpal. The next day he is hung over and smells slightly of p1ss and vomit whenever his younger brother informs him that in Germany, Mieke is not ""Mike"" but a woman  so that amazingly hot girl in the photo he has was Mieke, not the guy standing next to her. Determined not to be predictable and miss out again, Scott joins friends Cooper, Jenny and Jamie on a trip across Europe to try and get to Berlin and, by extension, into Mieke.",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv

17 December 2020,archilzhvania,10," One of the best comedies ever
","I was surprised to see such a low rating, because it is an awesome comedy movie with lots of hilarious moments. I have watched it several times, never gotten bored of it.",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2004,Victor Field,," No ""Road Trip,"" but no ""Eurotrash"" either.
","""Eurotrip"" isn't really in the same league as the crass but hilarious ""Road Trip"" (also from DreamWorks Pictures and the Montecito Picture Company), though it shares the same mindset and basic premise of a guy trekking with his friends to sort out a misunderstanding with a lady. Unlike that movie, however, it doesn't have enough momentum to sustain itself all the way; it goes in stops and starts, with moments of real hilarity (like the robot mime duel in France set to ""Two Tribes"") between bits of the filmic equivalent of dead air.",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2021,burnzyburns,9," Hilarious in-direct sequel to Road Trip
","Oh man do I love EuroTrip. All these years later and it's still a classic. I have debated if this movie is better then the original Road Trip and sometimes I think it is. Yes it's incredibly stupid but it's aware of itself and that's what makes it so funny. But lord have mercy, wherever they found that girl to play Mieke someone better have gotten a fat pay check for life or a great retirement pension. She is an angel from the heavens. Seeing her in person and waiting for Scottie to meet her at the end of the movie is so satisfying and it works perfectly because Scottie is extremely likeable and Mieke is just incredibly charming and sensitive. The supporting cast, Scotties friends, get props too. Underrated cult classic!",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2005,JennieMcJenJen,8," SOOOO Funny
","I love all types of movies, but I didn't expect to like this one. It looked like another stupid teen comedy to me. I was so surprised at how hilarious this was. I was rolling on the floor laughing my ass off. My new favorite song is ""Scotty Doesn't Know!"" And while this movie doesn't properly represent Europe and it's style and it's culture, it does enlist every stereotype Americans have about Europeans, and that's what makes it so damn funny. This movie is definitely one of my new favorites, and is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. If you just want to laugh at everything that's wrong with the world, then this is totally something you need to see.",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2005,MLDinTN,6," raunchy fun
","This movie follows in the footsteps of films like American Pie. It aims for the young adult audience with a lot of sexual humor and nudity. And some of the jokes are funny. The film follows 4 recent high school graduates on a trip around Europe. Scott decides to go to Berlin to meet a girl he's been emailing. But, he thought she was a he and told her not to come to America to visit. When learning of his mistake, he makes the overseas trip with Cooper. They meet up with the twins in Paris and all 4 travel together.",/review/rw0994754/?ref_=tt_urv
