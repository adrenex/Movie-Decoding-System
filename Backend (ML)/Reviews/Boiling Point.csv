","A remake of a great film that is a remake of an even greater film (Akira Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai'), there are worse remakes out there than 2016's 'The Magnificent Seven'. Primarily 'Psycho', 'The Wicker Man', 'Rollerball', 'Ghostbusters' and 'Stepford Wives'.",/review/rw5672678/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2016,aj1218,5," A 6 if you didn't see the original a 4 if you did
","The third American remake of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. It has a great deal of the same issues but they are exacerbated in this third iteration. This movie of the three has weakest storytelling but some of the best action, but it doesn't feel like a western. And it isn't quite an action movie instead it is this kind of middle ground that just makes the movie feel lost and out of place. And that is one of the over arching issues with this movie, it doesn't know what it wants to be.",/review/rw5672678/?ref_=tt_urv

","Come on now. If you're going to re-make ""The Magnificent 7"" let's do it magnificently. Where was that great music? Where is the superlative cast that include Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Vladimir Sokoloff? You might argue that Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt are on a level with Brynner and McQueen, but I wouldn't. Pratt certainly has potential, but he doesn't yet have McQueen's star power. The rest are pale imitations, except perhaps for an unbelievably fat Vincent D'Onofrio who is certainly entertaining.",/review/rw5672678/?ref_=tt_urv

","Y'know how sometimes the remake of a film can, if not actually improve upon the original - though, arguably, 'Scarface' does just that - take a different approach to the story of characters which is equally engaging, or sufficiently different to make the revamp justified...but not SO different that all it has is a titular connection to the original?

5 September 2018,Coventry,3," The ""Magnificent"" part is very, very debatable
","As well as every normal male (or female, for that matter) film buff, I'm a tremendous fan of the 1960 Western classic ""The Magnificent Seven"". I honestly don't think you can have anything against that film, and you can't even object to the idea of a remake, since the original itself is already a remake of Akira Kurasawa's landmark ""Seven Samurai"". So here I was looking forward to Antoine Fuqua's version, albeit with reasonably low expectations; - just a good two hours of undemanding but exciting gunslinger entertainment! What a major disappointment! ""The Magnificent Seven"" isn't the least bit spectacular or memorable, it's just plain boring and inferior on every possible level. Although I tried hard not to compare, it's just inescapably evident that Hollywood can't assemble a kick-ass ensemble cast anymore like they could in 1960. How on earth do you recast icons like Yul Brunner, Steven McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn? With Denzel Washington? He's okay, I guess. Chris Pratt? Meh! Ethan Hawke? No way! Vincent D'Onofrio? What the hell! The painful truth is that not a single character of the 2016-version deserves to even stand in the shadows of the 1960-version protagonists. That goes for the villainous characters as well, by the way, since Peter Sarsgaard isn't exactly menacing as the supposedly merciless and megalomaniac landowner Bartholomew Bogue. Heck, his minions even must do stuff like spit chewing tobacco on the church's floor to emphasize just how evil they are. Oh, and don't even get me started on how obviously the script is politically correct. Lame!",/review/rw5672678/?ref_=tt_urv

","Most of the bad reviews are coze its been compared to the original one. But if u forget about it and lay back, its a good movie with great acting. My favorite is always Ethan Hawke. Of course whats missing is some really good music but hey, we heard worse, right",/review/rw5672678/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2017,mhorg2018,1," Barely watchable unnecessary remake
","First let me say this, even the superior 1960's version pales before the often imitated Seven Samurai. Having said that, where is the story for this? These seven guys (all politically correct as befits our wimp society) have virtually no back story. All this film and we learn next to nothing about any of them. They get together like it's nothing. No qualms, no trouble. Let's just train these cowardly townspeople. And they do so in a week. There's massive bloodshed in this but it's so lifeless I couldn't care at all. I didn't even when the good guys were getting killed. And one of them has a totally ridiculous death that took any reality out of this film. (No spoilers here - watch it and see for yourself.) How come no one ever reloads in this either? It's just shooting and shooting and shooting. At least the Indian character runs out of arrows. Really if you want to see a great western, break out Unforgiven or Open Range. This one may live on as a curiosity, but it's little more than that. Want to see a good remake? True Grit, which is a closer adaptation to the novel and isn't buried in PC crap like this.",/review/rw5672678/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2017,Mr-Fusion,5," The Forgettable Seven
","I still hold to the belief that there's still a market for Westerns - even in this day and age - just not passable ones. And I also know that there are considerations to be made when viewing a remake. But they didn't have to call this ""The Magnificent Seven"", either. This is a notable cast, but isn't a patch on the original. Of these players, I found Ethan Hawke to have the most depth, while Chris Pratt (though enjoyable) an awkward fit; Denzel's just being Denzel. It's like the other four guys are also-rans.",/review/rw5672678/?ref_=tt_urv

",There is a huge gun battle so those who are watching for that will be satisfied. Sadly this movie could have been better written. The dialog isn't clever in fact it sounds dumb most of the time.

9 September 2016,trublu215,5," It had all the ingredients to be great but instead it is merely just ""OK"".
","Antoine Fuqua's The Magnificent Seven is about as brazen as the cowboys it portrays. It is loud, visceral and action packed but lacks the necessary functions for it to be a truly great film. Despite Fuqua's most confident directing and Denzel Washington's excellent performance, the film ends up being as cluttered as the cast would suggest. When it all comes down to it, it is a matter of an overload of star power. While there have been films in the past that have had incredible casts and flourished, this film makes it feel as though the film is only big enough for one star. Chris Pratt is great as an alcoholic and incredibly ballsy gunslinger, Faraday, but he lacks any gusto to really command the screen as does most of the cast outside of Denzel Washington (someone who I can't say enough good things about here). It ends up feeling like these roles could have been played by anyone when it should have felt like these actor's owned these roles so much so that you can't imagine anyone else in it. Unfortunately that isn't the case here. Quite frankly, the only performances worth noting are Washington and Peter Sarsgaard, who gives a devilishly good performance as a sadistic law man. In this respect, the film is very much a disappointment for anyone expecting to see the next great ensemble film of the year. More importantly, those of you who were excited to see the re-teaming of the Training Day squad (Washington, Hawke and Fuqua) will have to wait a bit longer for that because there is barely any chemistry between Ethan Hawke's Goodnight Robicheaux and Washington's Chisolm. The screenplay, written by True Detective's Nic Pizzolatto and action aficionado, Richard Wenk is lackluster to say the least. As I said, the character development with the characters is either not there or so forced and unnatural that it takes you out of it. After the abysmal season 2 of True Detective and this, I think is safe to say that Pizzolatto is turning into the one hit wonder that everyone feared that he would be. However, I will still hold off on officially saying that about him because there are some ideas that were introduced in the film that were really interesting which is why it is all the more frustrating when they are cast aside and never touched upon again. The screenplay is the big problem here. It is well paced but emotionally hollow. It never really reaches anywhere near the heights of the Kurosawa masterpiece or even the 1957 remake that that film spawned. In this case, the script reads and sounds like a bad imitation. Despite this, The Magnificent Seven does boasts some pretty exceptional action set pieces much to Fuqua's credit. The film is explosive but it is highly predictable. Those who are killed don't really resonate with the viewer because quite honestly, we don't care about any of the characters outside of Washington. They are mere footnotes to the larger picture which is a monumental disappointment. Overall, I thought that Antoine Fuqua's The Magnificent Seven boasted a great idea and never truly capitalized on it. The film felt like it really could have been something but we are left holding on to the idea of what could have been.",/review/rw5672678/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2016,Troy_Campbell,8," An energetic and highly entertaining Western.
","The Western has long become a rarity on the big screen, replaced over the last few decades as the dominant action genre first by bulging muscles and explosions, then by spandex and superpowers. So this big-budget remake of the 1960 classic comes as a welcome breath of tobacco-filled air, even if it doesn't quite live up to its predecessor. But as a piece of popcorn entertainment, it fires on all cylinders. Not surprisingly with Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, The Equalizer, Shooter) calling the shots, subtlety is pushed aside for frenetic set pieces and belief-defying heroics, especially in the wild climactic showdown that demonstrates minimal CGI does not equal minimal fun. Amongst all the balletic gunplay and macho posturing there's a relatively simple story: town is overrun by a dastardly villain (Peter Sarsgaard oozing creepiness), town employs cowboys-for-hire (guess how many) for protection, town fights with said cowboys leading the way. That the plot requires little more explanation then that highlights the focus of the movie, for better and for worse, however the fact it never feels shallow or superficial can be attributed to the exhilarating action and the ultra-cool cast. And what a fantastic cast it is. Denzel Washington is reliably charismatic as the contemplative leader, Chris Pratt is magnetic as the group's joker, Ethan Hawke is intense as the tormented sniper, Byung-hun Lee is enigmatic as the blade-wielding assassin, Vincent D'Onofrio is intriguing as the philosophical killer and Haley Bennett is fierce as the townswoman who stands her ground. Best of all, the eclectic characters – also including Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as the rowdy Mexican and Martin Sensmeier as the Indian warrior – share a wonderful chemistry that makes them utterly watchable from start to finish. An energetic remake with style to spare, The Magnificent Seven is a rip-roaring adventure that'll please long-neglected Western fans to no end.",/review/rw5672678/?ref_=tt_urv

24 September 2016,wingnut9,," Very Underwhelming. Too PC for its own good.
","Seven is the magic number. A ""seven"" rating for a somewhat underwhelming movie. The gun fights were well executed and the cast as good as advertised. It's the story that lagged. The team assembling so quickly and their rationales for doing so are near nonsensical and shallow. Also, PC Hollywood rearing its head was noticeable and irritating. Casting the lead as a black man was absolutely fine (especially given a superb talent like Denzel Washington) and actually added to the narrative but adding an Indian, Asian and Mexican to the team for good measure seemed tacked on and forced to a silly degree. Making sure ALL the white men suffer a bad fate before the end of the movie adds to the ""white man guilt"" Hollywood is so keen on promoting nowadays. ",/review/rw5672678/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2016,RodrigAndrisan,2," Not by far as good as the original
","Generally remakes are worse than the originals. And this is no exception. Antoine Fuqua is only an amateur besides John Sturges. Denzel Washington is not a bad actor but, not only that he can't be compared with Yul Brynner but, he has no place in a western. The bad guy, Peter Sarsgaard, is just a joke besides Eli Wallach. The other six, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, Byung-hun Lee, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Martin Sensmeier, all the character names changed, are also caricatures besides Steve McQueen, Horst Buchholz, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, Brad Dexter, James Coburn. Alone, Haley Bennett(somewhat resembling Madeleine Stowe) is both a pleasant presence. Worthless, useless, needless film.",/review/rw5672678/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2016,robert-259-28954,1," Pure Hollywood Garbage.
","This remake of the 60's classic is enough to make any serious movie fan vomit in his cowboy boots. It fails on every possible level, bastardizing every cliché in the business just to generate business. Unlike the fabulous score of the original, even the music sucks (evidently an unimaginative regurgitation of bits and pieces of everything James Horner had ever heard), none of the actors could actually ACT, and the storyline was a total desecration of the original— lacking the story, heart, and soul of perhaps the single greatest Western action/adventure film in history. The only reason I'm giving this turkey a ""1"" however, is the a accurate use of character types in the movie, wisely choosing to use talent that actually looked the part... dirty. But I'd rather take the Hollywood movie stars of the past over the bored, uninvolved actors riding roughshod through this cinematic misadventure, especially the brain dead producers who actually believe that mindless revenge and violence will ever make up for a decent script, turning good filmmaking solely into a creation for corporate profit.",/review/rw5672678/?ref_=tt_urv
