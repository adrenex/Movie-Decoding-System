9 December 2000,cariart,8," Charming Comedy is No 'Loser'!
","Amy Heckerling's latest teen comedy, 'Loser', is an old-fashioned charmer where nice guys finish first, sweet girls end up making the right choices, and pushy 'users' get their just desserts! Perhaps nobility is passe in films today, but 'Loser' makes a great case for working class heroes who succeed by 'doing the right thing'.",/review/rw3589780/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2000,spazierganger,6," Predictable, but still very entertaining
","Yes, Loser is a very predictable film. Plotwise, it follows most other romantic comedy type movies. But still, there is enough here to make it stand out somewhat. Granted, being better than most teen romantic comedies isn't much of an accomplishment, but Loser is a good movie, even though I knew what was going to happen.",/review/rw3589780/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have always been the outsider as a teenager (why do you think I have hundreds of movies on my comment list), so I can relate to this film.  Not because I have gone to a college from a far off land and am not familiar with the area.  But because I have always known what It's like to not always get the girl, always to be alone and to have such low self-esteem you make eeyore from Winnie the Pooh look like Richard Simmons.  So I can sympathize. But saying did I like the entire movie, no.  Because the main heroine (Mena Suvari) knows who is the right one in her life (her choices are the teen Jason Biggs and a married professor Greg Kinnear) and takes too long to find out who the right one is (I am not revealing who that is).  While she and Biggs are likeable characters, they also make dumb choices in the dating game.  Sort of like Boys and Girls which came out last month.  Yet, I can reccomend this film to teen film fans, Everclear fans, or fans of writer/director/co-producer Amy Heckerling's work (she is of Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Clueless fame).  Just don't go into it looking for a way to find better love.  B+",/review/rw3589780/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have to say, I honestly hate those roommates of Paul's lol! They would be the sort of roommates you wouldn't want to be spending the night with. I really think they are mostly the losers in this situation. I feel sorry for their parents.

26 February 2001,Rourke,9," Amusing and honest college movie
","Unfairly condemned by the critics, this movie worked for me as a comedy and as a somewhat dark look at the mores of college life. Our hero may be branded a loser, but he's definitely a believable three-dimensional character (with a heart of gold, naturally). The story takes for granted some unethical and potentially unsettling behaviour, and allows the characters to rise above it.",/review/rw3589780/?ref_=tt_urv

13 March 2011,jboothmillard,1," Loser
","From director Amy Heckerling (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Clueless), I remember seeing the DVD cover featuring the star one of the most recognisable teen movies, so I wanted to see why it was rated low. Basically Paul Tannek (American Pie's Jason Biggs) has arrived in New York City from the Midwest on an academic scholarship, and attending his new college it is obvious he is pretty out of place. He can't seem to find anyone that he can engage in a conversation or make any kind of friendship, due to a few mishaps, and being put with three spoilt party animal roommates. He is branded a loser by pretty much everyone he has come into contact with, and after being chucked out by his roommates he finds himself a job helping out and a room in a veterinary clinic. It is there that Paul meets and has an instant attraction for fellow coed student Dora Diamond (American Pie's Mena Suvari), the only person who seems to take any notice of him and his problems. He is devastated when he finds out that struggling Dora is dating and having an affair with a man nearly twenty years above her, literature teacher Professor Edward Alcott (Greg Kinnear). Slowly however she may be gaining more of a connection with the troubled Paul, the only thing that the professor wants to do with her is have sex with no affectionate complications at all. In the end, Paul may have made himself a bit more relevant in the stakes at the college, and of course Dora realises Edward is the wrong man for her, and they get together for the happy ending kiss. Also starring Zak Orth as Adam, Thomas 'Tom' Sadoski as Chris, Jimmi Simpson as Noah, Dan Aykroyd as Dad, Andy Dick as Another City Worker, Steven Wright as Panty Hose Customer, Alan Cumming as Himself / Emcee and David Spade as Video Store Clerk. I should start by saying that I did like most of the soundtrack songs, including Wheatus's ""Teenage Dirtbag"", The Offspring's ""Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)"", Eiffel 65's ""Blue (Da Ba Dee)"" and The Bloodhound Gang's ""Bad Touch"". Biggs is almost the same as his most well known character, Suvari is okay as the teen having an affair, this is a film meant to have some gross moments, but to be honest I was so bored throughout that I didn't notice, not one moment made me laugh, a rubbish teen comedy romance. Poor!",/review/rw3589780/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2014,BlueFairyBlog,2," The Hat and the Hottie
","Amy Heckerling doesn't quite know what kind of audience she is trying to engage. If she's trying to show high school kids the problems and unexpected strife of college life in a metropolis, then she should have shown that world in a more focused way. If she's trying to be funny and quirky for the older subset than her characters should have been better written and less dickish. Besides being clinically underwritten, it's difficult to figure out who is the lead character, or at least the person we're supposed to sympathize with. Throughout the film we follow Paul (Biggs) and it seems that he is our protagonist. We feel for him when his dorm mates are mean spirited, when the girl of his dreams is misguided, and when everything tries to keep him from getting through school, but he lacks character development. He goes through hard times, but there's no resolution to be seen, and he doesn't change at all. Dora (Suvari) on the other hand has a mess of bad things happen to her, and then she changes her opinion about her relationship with her professor (Kinnear), which means she's the only character who evolves throughout the film. It seems that we should be following her, but then interwoven in her tale is that of Paul's, who just seems like some poor schmuck who never wins. Without any proper direction for our characters, and no change in their behaviors or thoughts on the world, there shouldn't really be any reason for this film to exist. It's trying to show the problems of college students, but it doesn't realistically depict them. Paul's three roommates are also pretty distracting, as they're rich, sycophantic rapists, who don't seem to get much comeuppance until the credits. Besides its plot defects it's also drab and very of its time, making this film a tiring slog.",/review/rw3589780/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2009,mario_c,6," Entertaining teenage romantic comedy
","It's a teenage romantic comedy about a guy that goes to New York to go to college. He's from the countryside and he feels a bit out of context there, because people reject him for his simplicity. It's a simple story, quite realistic, and it's done in a funny and entertaining way (I especially enjoyed the scene when they do a teenage party inside the vet shop, with all the dogs and cats! It was funny!:). There're nice performances from Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari who do the main characters. The soundtrack is appropriated to a teen movie. It's nothing outstanding but it's a nice and entertaining film. I score it 6/10.",/review/rw3589780/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2003,samari_garvin-1,8," Not as bad as people say
","I don't know why people like to bash this movie, it is a nice little remake of the 1960 classic ""the apartment"" where in a businessman sells out to his bosses so they can use his apartments to have affairs with other women, but when one attempts suicide in his house, it happens to be the one he falls in love with, the same story is evident here, Biggs plays the role well, and Suvari could play Shirley MacLaine in future remakes, the same with Kinnear and MacMurray, this could become one of those films that could get young people involved into the classics.",/review/rw3589780/?ref_=tt_urv

","How long was this movie? 10 hours? 12 hours? That's what it felt like. What a terrible waste of time this was. First of all, this was an obvious and awful attempt to rekindle some of the inexplicable American Pie hype with Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari. Suvari knows how to act, as she proved in American Beauty, she just didn't do it here. Jason Biggs is the biggest mystery in the film industry right now.

","I just love this movie. Just like another review on here said, to me it his kind of close to home. I've never been too lucky with the ladies this movie just seemed very personal to me. and while some i guess thought they weren't that great of a pair, i honestly loved the interaction between the two main characters. this is one of those ""i really wish that kind of thing would happen to me"" and it's a movie that i really enjoy watching to kind of ""escape"" for a little bit. i also think it is just overall a pretty good movie despite it's incredibly low rating. i think the three roommate characters are quite amusing, it has a lot of funny quotes and plot events, and a lot of the drama is good too. overall this is just in my opinion a very entertaining movie and it has a somewhat unique effect on me and will always be one of my favorites.",/review/rw3589780/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was surprised how good this movie actually is. It's more romance than a comedy because there were not many jokes but a story, characters and soundtrack made this film great. There were no boring moments. I've watched this film because of Wheatus music video Dirtbag Baby (this song is a theme of Loser) expecting to see something like that in a movie but a movie was different than music video and still I wasn't disappointed. Most of jokes were about Jason Biggs character and it wasn't very funny, actually it made me feel sorry for him. But anyways the movie itself was great. So if you are expecting this movie to be funny you may be disappointed but on the other hand it's a great love story.",/review/rw3589780/?ref_=tt_urv

26 July 2000,Iceman-73,1," The title says it all...
","Although Amy Heckerling (director of ""Clueless"", ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"") tries to create another teen pop film, ""Loser"" is shallow and boring. The script leaves a lot to be desired, which is most evident in the ending sequence between Jason Biggs (""American Pie"") and Mena Suvari (""American Beauty""). Both actors give a lackluster performance, riddled with clichés and stereotypes. Greg Kinnear (""As Good As It Gets"") does a fair job, which seems god-like in comparison to Biggs, Suvari, and the rest of the cast. The trio of Thomas Sadoski, Zak Orth, and Jimmi Simpson, who play Biggs' college dormmates, form one of the worst groups of characters in recent film history. Their senseless mockery of Biggs' character borders on the ridiculous. Cameos from Andy Dick (""NewsRadio"") and David Spade (""SNL"", ""Tommy Boy"") were entertaining, but were quickly lost in the abyss of stale plot lines and bad acting. The saving grace of this film is the soundtrack, which features some of the year's best like Wheatus' ""Teenage Dirtbag"" and SR-71's ""Right Now"".",/review/rw3589780/?ref_=tt_urv
