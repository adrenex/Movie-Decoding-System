5 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Dumb and Dumber
","In my opinion the greatest comedy ever made! Daniels and Carrey work magic together in this film that more than 20 years later is finally considered a classic. When it first came out it was labeled as complete garbage and toilet humour. But to those people I say it is the best garbage and toilet humour you could ask for. What do you expect to see when the title of the film is ''Dumb and Dumber''. The quick back and forth between the two lead actors and not so subtle chirping often goes unnoticed because your'e laughing so hard from the previous scene.the jokes and dialogue are so good and Carey and Daniels deliver them with such authenticity. It's because of this reason that I am able to watch this movie countless times and still be entertained, as I listen to funny remarks that I missed on the previous 100 viewings. What's truly great about this film is that even people who say they hate it will always without fail crack a laugh or two when re-watching it. They just don't want to admit that they find this nonsense to be funny...but it is. More than 20 years later and I still have not seen a buddy comedy that comes close to matching it.",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2006,MovieAddict2016,10," I laughed, I cried, and I think my IQ dropped. I love this movie!
","The Marx Brothers. Laurel and Hardy. Abbott and Costello. Jerry Lewis. Every generation has their dose of silliness. The 1990s had Jim Carrey. And along with him came the phenomenal hit ""Dumb and Dumber,"" a simple tale of two numb skulls who journey to Aspen in search of a woman and happiness.",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2000,Anonymous_Maxine,10," By far Jim Carrey's funniest movie, Dumb & Dumber delivers the best laughs to come to the silver screen in years.
","From beginning to end, Dumb & Dumber is sheer hilarity. There is not a slow moment in the adventures of Harry and LLoyd, two great but incredibly unintelligent friends who decide to move to Aspen, Colorado to get out of their dead-end lives in Providence, Rhode Island. Jim Carrey delivers a side-splitting performance as Lloyd, the lovestruck limo driver who first suggested the trip to Aspen (""We got no food, we got no jobs, our pets HEADS ARE FALLIN' OFF!!""), mostly so that he can find Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly), the woman he fell in love with after he drove her to the airport in Providence.",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2003,lambiepie-2,8," A movie that lives up to its title
","When this first came out in 1994, wild horses couldn't drag me to the theater to see it. Why? Preconceived notions. Thank goodness for Cable TV, or I never would have seen this film. I like it, it makes me laugh.",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2020,heisenberg12,9," Hands down, the funniest movie ever made
","Saw it a hundred times, and from crying in laughter to making your stomach hurt from laughing so hard, it is one of the funniest movies of all time. Caught it again recently for the over one hundredth time and tried to view it as an older skeptic, and I laughed even harder at scenes that originally were not as funny as the funniest ones. It's just an infallible, brilliant comedy that pushes the envelope just enough without going too far like some recent imitator movies of it have done.",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2005,Pookyiscute,10," Funniest Farrley's Brother movie you will ever see...
","It's hard to find a Farrley's Brother which isn't funny, and this is even harder to classify as, 'not funny'...because it is the funniest!",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2020,kosmasp,9," Gross, quirky and weird
","Now how does that sound? And I may not even have gotten all of the ""bad"" things one can say about this movie. But it is also hillarious and super funny! Which is a testament to the two main actors, who are actually anything close to not being intelligent! And both relish in their roles respectively. The sequel that came years later (the official one, not the prequel one) was funny too, but showed that you can't catch lightning in a bottle. I think that's the saying, right? Maybe not, but whatever the case is, this is a classic.",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2006,ccthemovieman-1,8," Played Strictly For Laughs
","It's hard to believe this was out over a decade ago, but it was another in a long line (past few decades) of crude comedies....BUT one of the better ones regarding some laugh-out-loud funny scenes.",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2001,Howlin Wolf,8," I liked it, others may not...
","... because the gags are so quickfire and chucked into the script with little thought as to whether they suit the plot (what plot?) or whether the characters would realistically say them.  No matter for me, because I was laughing all the way through, but I can appreciate why some people might not like that.",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2006,cornhol675,10," Will most likely continue to be the funniest movie of all time.
","Dumb and Dumber is a stupid movie, but what some people don't understand is that is what it is supposed to be! It's about two completely pathetic, dumb, and hopeless guys who do nothing but make complete fools of themselves. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels give the greatest comedic performances and form the best duo that has ever graced a screen. Every scene, every sentence they speak, and every body movement is pure genius. The way that each of them deliver their lines makes this movie an all time classic that will never get old. I never understood how someone could not like this movie. The only explanation I could have is they think they are too ""intelligent"" for a ""dumb movie"" like this. What they don't even understand that it's not the jokes or gags that make this movie so great, it is all in the performances. To those of you who do not like this movie please give it another try and watch Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play the roles that they were meant to play.",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2014,Geeky Randy,10," No matter how many times you watch it, it's still funny
","The Farrelly Brothers' 1994 road-comedy about buddies Carrey and Daniels (who make a surprisingly perfect duo of morons) travelling from Providence to Aspen and the troubles their dimwittedness brings them. Met with lukewarm reviews upon its release, but those who grew up with it will appreciate it for the classic that it is. No matter how many times you've seen it, there are still new jokes to uncover because you didn't realize it before (""She sent me a John Deere letter"") or that you missed because you were still laughing about something else. Believe it or not, Daniels is just as funny as (or maybe even funnier than) Carrey! Accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack.",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 1998,Innsaane,," Brilliance!
","Dumb and Dumber is so stupid, it's brilliant....The dumb humor and wonderful acting from Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are so  well layed-out, and so well told, that this rates up as good tasteless comedy.  This movie is not for everyone though, a silly mood, and a taste for bathroom humor is required to sit through this, but if you qualify you're in for a major treat.  ****",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2006,iggyivan,10," ""Dumb and Dumber"" is really ""Funny and Funnier""
","This movie goes from joke to joke constantly and never misses a beat. I could not stop laughing the first time I saw it, and the tenth time I saw it, and the hundredth time I saw it. This movie never gets old. There is not one single dull moment. The movie takes off and never lets up, not even enough to let you breathe. There is something absolutely mesmerizing and hilarious about Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels' performances as the lovable idiots Lloyd Christmas( Jim Carrey) and Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels).",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2018,cricketbat,10," One of the funniest films of all time
","I'll say it: this is one of the funniest films of all time. Few films can make me laugh each time I see them, but Dumb and Dumber manages to do just that. Yes, it's over the top and a little too crude at parts, but it really is, and will continue to be laugh out loud funny.",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2005,lee_eisenberg,10," Oh admit it, you love this movie!
","Hot off ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" and ""The Mask"", Jim Carrey affirmed that 1994 was his year with ""Dumb & Dumber"". As the hilariously stupid Lloyd Christmas, he lets it all out. Jeff Daniels is equally funny as the equally brainless Harry Dunne. On a quest to return a suitcase to Lloyd's passenger Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly), the two imbeciles have a series of crazy adventures.",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2021,ma-cortes,6," Fun and disconcerting film with slapstick humor and extremely hilarious situations
","An amusing and entertaining film about two odd and moronic guys . The picture narrates the various pranks , mayhem, mischiefs , frolics and lots of mugging carried out by the outlandish couple . This one will definitively not appeal to the stuffy critic or arthouse snob. An offbeat story of sex-minded people , dealing with brainless youthful and made with total craziness. The movie talks upon the adventures and misfortunes of two no-brain , quirk youngsters , Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey) . They are idiot pals who are continuously doing jokes and seeing lustfully by the opposite sex . Both of whom travel in a strange Sheep dog Van from Rhode Island to Aspen , Colorado to return a briefcase full of cash to gorgeous socialite (Lauren Holly) . Along the way they attempt to solve problems without success . The average person uses 10% of their brain capacity. Imagine what he could do with 1%. What the one doesn't have, the other is missing. If they each had half a brain, together they would still only have half a brain. For Harry and Lloyd every day is a no-brainer.",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 1998,El Celis,9," a barrel of laughs! (and more...)
","Destined to become a classic in its genre, DUMB & DUMBER reaches its objective of making people laugh off their seats, in a film that crowns Carrey as the modern Lewis & gives Daniels a great chance to show us his lighter side.     This is the kind of movie you want to see 100 times, with pranks & puns so silly you love to hate! high moments are Daniel`s bout with the toilet, the parakeet incident, and Jim Carrey`s love declaration to a schoolboy. If U R not silly and have no sense of humor, and basically are not alive , don`t watch this movie...otherwise, rent the video, order some pizza & beer and prepare for 1999: Dumb & Dumber (The early years)       Two fingers up",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2003,george.schmidt,," FINALLY a film that lives up to its title!
","DUMB AND DUMBER (1995) ***1/2 Jim Carrey, Jeff Daniels, Lauren Holly, Teri Garr, Charles Rocket, Mike Starr, Karen Duffy, Harland Williams.  Finally a film that lives up to its title!! Side-splittingly funny moronic comedy with two half-wits (Carrey and Daniels, truly inspired casting) on the road to return a briefcase to a beautiful woman Carrey is ga-ga for.  Ingeniously stupid and riotously hysterical with bathroom humor running as rampant as the doltish duo's frenetic hairstyles.  Go ahead and laugh.  Written and directed by Bobby and Peter Farrelly.",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2013,SnoopyStyle,9," Funny & Funnier
",Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels) is a dog groomer. Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) is a limo driver. It's questionable who is dumb and who is dumber. Let's just say that both are world class competitors in the event. Lloyd falls heavily for Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly). He picks up her suitcase and travels cross country to return it. Little does he know that she left it deliberately for a couple of kidnappers as ransom.,/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2020,bryanplateado,10," Possibly Jim Carrey's best movie
","Dumb and Dumber is such a funny movie. I love everything about this movie, from the performances to the directing. This movie always makes me laugh every time I watch it. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play off of each other amazingly. Their comedic moments shine so bright of every minute of the movie. The writing is also very good. The Farrelly Brothers did a very good job making their first movie, and it's one of their only good movies if I'm being honest. Dumb and Dumber is a great movie. There's not a single problem I have with this movie. I love this movie, so if you haven't seen Dumb and Dumber, go and watch it.",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2006,Doylenf,5," Lives up to its title and then some...
","I realize I'm in the minority by not being a gushing fan of potty humor and a lot of scatological and very graphic sound effects, but DUMB AND DUMBER is definitely a movie that clicked with its targeted audience. And I can't ignore the fact that JIM CARREY and JEFF DANIELS have the ability to mug with the best of them, both showing lots of dexterity with comic material that they play to the hilt.",/review/rw6496872/?ref_=tt_urv
