6 January 2023,jfgibson73,8," The rare case in which I 100% got what I expected
","Most movies seem to either be underwhelming or just fine. Once in a great while, they over-deliver and exceed your expectations. But possibly the rarest result is when you are excited to see a movie and you get exactly what you'd hoped for. For me, M3GAN was a blast of entertainment, a perfect concoction of a well-paced story that is just there for you to have fun with. Okay, if I'm honest, it did have some moments that elevated my enjoyment even a little more than I'd hoped--they went to a few places I could not have expected. That doesn't mean that the story wasn't predictable; it was pretty clear where this was going the whole time. But it was still fun and memorable, and I expect that if I ever happen to walk into a room where someone has this movie on, I will sit and watch with them to the end. I enjoyed it.",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,superfox_888,4," Can't believe people are charging money to see this
","The acting is bad, the plot is bad, the entire movie is bad. In this entirely predictable farce, an orphaned kid is sent to live with an aunt who is coding kids toys. Guess what happens next?",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,mrashtastic89,4," This isn't horror
","For the first movie theater experience I had in 2023, M3gan was just not it, this is barely a horror film, and more so a comedy/parody, in the same vein as the 2019 Child's Play remake, take an actually good idea and slap a PG-13 rating on it, you've got M3gan.",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,jjdausey,5," Weirdly overpraised
","Fine, it's a moderately entertaining deadly doll movie but... seriously, it's been a bit overpraised. This is paint by numbers storytelling. A beat by beat remake of every ""deadly friend"" tale. Also, while I generally find her appealing, Allison Williams looks like she's about to crack up half the time. It's also a little soft on the true horror/scares front. Id actually love to see an R rated sequel that goes as hard as ""Child's Play"" or ""Annabelle."" Anyway, it makes me sad to think that there are strong movies out right now (""Babylon,"" ""The Whale"") that audiences are ignoring in favor of this January junk.",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,FeastMode,4," Toned down to PG-13 so teens can watch
","M3gan is another example of a movie that was originally meant to be rated R, absolutely should be rated R, but is toned down to PG-13 so they can sell more tickets. Instead of focusing on making something awesome for real movie fans, something people will talk about for years, they focus on the casuals and teens (there were even a few children at my viewing). I continue to ask, when are studios going to stop being cowards and have the courage to go all out?",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,LansTaylor,6," Just Fine
","Solid and, at times, actually entertaining. Like other reviewers have mentioned, this strikes me as another version of the 2019 Childs Play; a fun, doesn't-take-itself too-seriously movie. Nonetheless, it added its own spin to the horror/comedy genre with its intentional and unintentional comedy.",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,vengeance20,3," Below Average
","So, was highly skeptical of this one after reading reviews & of course, seeing the previews. But after viewing, the film wasn't too bad. But it wasn't much cop either & the reviews were right in a good couple of aspects.",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,trashgang,6," It shows that it was torn down from R-rated to PG-13
","First hype of 2023 is this horror flick coming from the hands of writer Wan. You know, the guy from Saw and The Conjuring amongst others. So I expected a lot from this flick.",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2022,tresm87,6," Recycled concepts molded and manufactured for gen z out of the Blumhouse factory.
","It seems especially in the horror genre nearly everything lately is regurgitated and advertised as something new. Blumhouse does this more than anyone lately and yet still manages to rake in profits from mostly generation z unfamiliar with the old classic horror films that came long before. The glaring similarities and material borrowing comes from basically every Chucky film, though it's presented in a way that's more appetizing to the newer tik tok gen z crowd. Not saying the film isn't still executed solidly or isn't effective. It just feels like such an obvious rewrapping of an old classic.",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,CANpatbuck3664,8," A Well Crafted Campy Comedy Wearing the Horror Genre as Camouflage
","I didn't vibe with M3gan's trailer when I first saw it. Killer artificial intelligence has been done time and time again plus adding the killer doll tropes just made it seem all the more cliche. But then the reviews came out, with critics heralding M3gan as a ""campy masterpiece"" and ""hilarious"" which admittedly piqued my interest. Having now seen M3gan, it's a comedy first but there's enough horror here to still qualify it for the genre. There are moments where M3gan is running down a prospective victim or doling out her varied forms of punishment that had me shuddering in my seat. Most of it is happening off screen but I was pleasantly surprised by how far the movie pushed the envelope, even if it was only implied. So while I can't call M3gan horrific or even scary, there's sufficient creepy material to qualify it for the genre still.",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,kskmah,1," Stop with the fake reviews already
","Why would you make a robot doll that is super strong and that has no safety protocols? Because this is a stupid movie written by stupid people. Why even make a doll for kids super strong? Every robot should have a kill switch. Don't these idiot watch any robot movies before? They are very advance and can create an ai robot but they don't have security cameras around the house? They never fully tested the doll but they were going to release it? And how much would the doll cost? They never mentioned it because it would be a ridiculous price. Also, you can make such an advance robot. Why isn't the government looking into this? Make a doll instead of a super solider? Good acting and production ruined by stupid things.",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hands down the better reboot of Child's Play than Child's Play (2019). Although it's predictable from start to finish, it was at least a better made movie in terms of production design and cinematography.",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,edfox-44818,2," Not in any way scary, technically stupid
","A film full of unlikable characters whom we care nothing about, a plot so thin it's like toilet paper. We know exactly what is going to happen from the get-go since it's the same as the trailer. It's never explained why the doll is evil, how she is created so quickly in like a week or how her AI works, . There are no real subplots, no real character development, just scene after scene of a creepy doll, an annoying girl and her clueless aunt. It's said there was a R version and it was cut down to gain a teen audience but I can't imagine more violence would make this any better. Don't pay to see this, you will probably want to walk out.",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,nscoby93,7," Surprisingly good and better than I anticipated

1 January 2023,A_Different_Drummer,7," Above average ""killer robo-doll"" flick
","The insane opening sequence firmly sets the tone. A family of three (husband, wife, young girl) appears to be driving head-first into a major snowstorm. As the audience tries to absorb this, the wife berates the husband for lying to a policeman about the car being 4WD -- when it really isn't! Still following?? Then, my favorite part, as the blizzard completely envelopes the car with a whiteout, the wife demands the husband stop right where he is -- in the middle of the road! -- so they can resolve their argument. If you are married, maybe that will make some sort of sense to you, but it is a heck of a way to start a movie. Seconds later, an oncoming truck hits them and --BAM-- the young girl is now an orphan. Bottom line, this is slickly produced, above-average, little horror flick that delivers on its core promise, which is to simply entertain. Nowhere in the PR package does it mention the word ""Chucky."" Enjoy it for what it is. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

","This movie could have been great if only it had a better writing team. The plot as it is is very derivative, lazy at times and formulaic. Something straight out the cookie cutter sci-fi mould.",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2023,akshatmahajan,5," Little bit overrated
","After watching the first trailer, I was excited to watch the movie and after hearing positive reviews my expectations rose. After watching the movie, it felt like I didn't see anything new. It was just same robot becoming enemy due to malfunction. The horror or thrilling elements were missing from the story. One thing I liked about the story was they tried to be realistic but we have seen this type of story millions of times. I don't know what will they do with the sequel. Maybe, make it a franchise like Child's Play. Who knows?",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2023,adlion94,5," Written and directed by less than clever people
","ME3AN does a great job with the ""look"" and aethetics of the doll in terms of it being the central element of the film. The premise of the film is also relatively logical, but much more far-fetched... orphaned girl lives with AI and robotics ""expert"" at a toy company. Who happens to be her aunt.",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,pika-28258,1," Embarrassing
","I never expect much from modern horror movies aside from some mildly entertaining scares and a fun story. The infamous 'corridor dance' scene shown on the trailer for M3GAN was what got me to gather some friends in the cinema for a laugh and maybe a cheap scare or two. Whilst there weren't any considerable scares in the movie at all, there was no shortage of laughter. Almost all attempts of comedy fell flat on its face, which was made up for in laughable scares and extremely goofy chase scenes. The protagonist 'Gemma' is completely lifeless and unlikeable which stands as a result of poor acting and writing. Any of the audiences attempts to relate or care for her at all are severed by her complete disregard for any of the situations she finds herself in and lack of emotion or empathy portrayed by her character. She doesn't seem to be really bothered at all about the insane s happening, which actually led me to anticipate a twist in which it is revealed that she is in fact a robot as well. The fact that M3GAN herself displays more human characteristics than the main character astounds me. With that said, no-one had a good performance but 'Gemma' was a product of careless writing and acting.",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,darkreignn,7," Campy and comedic
","""M3GAN"" is a crowd pleaser - after seeing this in a packed auditorium (complete with young kids sneaking in and sitting in the empty seats that I bought exclusively so people would not sit next to me), the roll of the credits marked the sound of uproarious applause by the entire theatre. And to be quite honest, that was the last thing I expected when walking into a film about a killer doll; but who am I to judge the taste of today's viewing audience? That said, even after experiencing the sheer joy of an over 100 person standing ovation - for me - ""M3GAN"" fell short.",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," A well shot fun ride.
","There really isn't much to complain about this little gem. It had everything going for it, from casting to production to directing etc. The story had a great flow to it, and although it was mostly predictable, it was still really fun to go along for the ride. All casting and performances were spot-on, although I felt Ronny Chieng was miscast. I am a fan, but somehow his character just didn't fit and wasn't as convincing as everyone else was. The visual effects for Megan were on point, as was the cinematography and score. The 102 min runtime flew by with the proper pacing. Overall a really fun watch and I certainly recommend it. I do hope they come out with at least one more sequel.",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,phoenix_ar,1," Absolute garbage
","The trailer looked interesting so I thought I'd give it a try. First off, there is nothing new here. It's the same old movie cliches one after another. There was nothing scary or thrilling about this ""horror thriller"" movie. The acting was horrible, and the plot and script were laughable. I couldn't tell if this was supposed to be a comedy or a thriller. I guess they were trying for both and failed on both parts. Most of the movie was so cheesy that I found myself rolling my eyes and shaking my head. I can't imagine anyone that would like this movie including the teenagers that were most likely the target audience. But to each their own. Had I not been on a date, I would have walked out of this movie. Don't waste your money on this absolute garbage of a movie.",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,ericgoldberg-50159,3," Ridiculous Plot
","So a toy company that makes basic talking pets can make the most sophisticated artificially intelligent doll in history. Doesn't make sense. A woman that created the doll uses it to babysit her niece rather than hiring a living, breathing babysitter. Also doesn't make sense. The A. I. doll kills people left and right and the woman who created it is absolutely oblivious to it even though it's extremely obvious. Really doesn't make sense. This movie is filled to the brim with nonsensical things. The woman who created the doll and allows it babysit her niece should have Child Protective Services called on her. She cares more about the doll and money than her own flesh and blood. This movie is about artificial intelligence but it's pathetically unintillegent.",/review/rw8781021/?ref_=tt_urv
