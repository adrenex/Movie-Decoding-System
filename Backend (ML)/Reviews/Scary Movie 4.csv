","I didn't know what the heck Penelope was, I only saw the trailer once and it looked very strange, I only saw the poster more than a few times and it again, didn't really catch my interest. But my friends and I decided to check it out and I'm actually glad that I saw it. As silly story that it is and a bit predictable, it's a good movie. Most romantic comedies tick me off because they are so predictable and the it's the same formula each time, Penelope is close to the same formula, but instead adds a fairy tale twist. It has the same moral of the story as most films of having to accept yourself, but Christina Ricci made it more charming and lovable. The cast was perfect and all did a great job, the looked like they had such a good time bringing this story to life.",/review/rw6546437/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2010,napierslogs,9," There are not enough ""Penelope""s in the world
","""Penelope"" opens with Christina Ricci narrating the story to us of how she, Penelope, was born with a curse - a pig nose. The film may seem childish and too fairy tale-like but Ricci speaks with such a soft pleasing manner that she reminds us of the best kindergarten teachers reading to us so we relax and settle in and comfortably enjoy the film.",/review/rw6546437/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2008,JoeytheBrit,," Better than expected
","What a lovely creature Christina Ricci is. Even with a pig's snout stuck to her face, I found her to be completely entrancing. She was certainly the only reason I decided to give this modern-day fairy tale a go and, on the whole, I'm fairly glad that I did. It has its weaknesses, for sure, the main one being that it can't seem to settle on a tone or to decide whether it takes place in Britain, America or some mythical amalgam of the two. The tone certainly could have been darker, even if the film is (probably) primarily aimed at teens considering its story (basically an update of Beauty and the Beast with gender roles reversed).",/review/rw6546437/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2007,toddy_aus,9," An uplifting tale with something for everyone.
","I saw this at a preview and really enjoyed this movie. It's a wonderful take on the common theme of accepting who you are, not what you are.",/review/rw6546437/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw ""Penelope"" at the US premiere at CineVegas last week. It has a very sweet message about self-acceptance that we could all use a little more of these days. I loved the hyper- real, brightly colored, Tim Burtonesque look of the film, it helped to accentuate the fairy tale aspect. ",/review/rw6546437/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2006,MadMaxiMum,10," Beauty and the Beast turned on its Nose
","Loved! Loved! Loved this Movie! One of the last movies I caught at the Toronto Film Festival....and by far my FAVORITE!!!!! Penelope is an original and uplifting story that reminds us of life's most fundamental truth -- that our beliefs lock us into a particular reality. It is packed full of excitement, surprises, laughs, heartfelt pangs and soaring joy. Christina Ricci is radiant as Penelope and in the face of daunting circumstances she inspires us to not only persevere but to dare to break free. It is a treat to see Reese Witherspoon portraying an edgier gal than norm and James McAvoy is a heartthrob! Oh, and the performance of Simon Woods is absolutely delightful and unforgettable! This movie is important, but I would give away the ending if I told you why!!",/review/rw6546437/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2008,simonparker1990,7," Not a pigs ear!
","It was only very recently I actually found out about Penelope, it was also actually yesterday I did a bit of research and realised how long ago Penelope was made, in fact it was made in 2006! When I discovered this I began to worry a bit about seeing it, despite a reasonably decent trailer the fact it had been delayed so long meant something was probably wrong with it. Well I saw it tonight, and while it isn't perfect the film is still a charming and thoroughly entertaining film. In many ways it reminded me slightly of one of my favourite films of all time, Edward Scissorhands. Unfortunately its nowhere near as good, but it does have its moments. I actually kind of wish that Tim Burton had got his hands on this movie as this really is the type of film he could make perfect. The film is a nice, family friendly flick, that while a bit cutesy at times has a genuine heart and some decent performances. Unfortunately the movie does have its problems, the ending comes on a bit sudden and the movie does start to struggle slightly in the middle section. But the film is guaranteed to give you a big smile and I definitely feel you can do a lot worse than see this film this half term.",/review/rw6546437/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2008,Cinema_Fan,6," With Penelope it's great; without Disney its better.
","Fairy tales are wide spread, with witches and curses they have, they are all too familiar with their poor damsel in need of rescue by the Charming Prince. The same can be said for poor Penelope, played by the essence of beauty and intelligence that is Christina Ricci. Famed for her roles as Wednesday Addams in the Addams Family movies, then ""Kat"" Harvey in Casper and during an Ice Strom she was Wendy Hood, hey, she's even dated a lesbian Monster and been chained up in Black Snake Moan. This, too, is the second in a row movie that consists of her taking a curse, the previous being John Carpenter's light horror werewolf flick Cursed (2005). You name it she has done it, and with perfection. Now all grown up she is playing the titular role of her 2006 movie Penelope.",/review/rw6546437/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2008,claudio_carvalho,8," Wonderful Fable with Magnificent Message
","Many years ago, the Wilhern family's maid got pregnant from the son of her master, but he is not allowed to marry her because she would not be ""one of their kind"". The woman commits suicide and her witch mother curses the daughters of the family that would have the face of a pig until one of them finds true love with one who will love her faithfully. Penelope Wilhern (Cristina Ricci) is the first legitimate girl after generations and born with nose of pig. Her mother Jessica (Catherine O'Hara) hides her from the world in the Wilhern mansion, and Penelope is raised alone, with no friends. When she becomes a young woman, her parents try to find a wealthy bachelor to marry her and break the curse. Meanwhile the tabloid reporter Lemon (Peter Dinklage) and the aristocrat Edward Humphrey Vanderman III (Simon Woods) that have issues against the Wilhern family hire the gambler Max (James McAvoy) to meet Penelope and take a picture of her. But their scheme does not work as planned.",/review/rw6546437/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2007,satinshoes,10," The most brilliant movie
","The movie is truthful, honest, funny, and amazing. Although I don't believe that there is an Oscar potential for this, I do believe Golden Globe awards for this. Christina Ricci's performance in this was delightful. While I was watching the movie, however, when Reese Witherspoon popped up, I was delighted! Although it wasn't very long, it was pleasing to see her in a very different role from others that she took.",/review/rw6546437/?ref_=tt_urv

27 August 2020,LoverOfFilmsAndMusic,9," Addicted
","I honestly could not tell you how many times I've watched this. It's DEFINITELY my favorite Christina Ricci film. It's a story about being different and the world viewing you as ugly. You're use to it because it's your face & you realize you're beautiful but everyone NEEDS love, but who can love you for you & NOT your money, what you have, what you can do for them but GENUINELY be IN LOVE with you as a person. I see myself in this film and that's why it's a great one in my eyes.",/review/rw6546437/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2008,barnabyrudge,6," Simple modern-day fable, diverting and watchable in its unambitious way.
","You remember that ever-so-slightly well-known story called Beauty And The Beast, don't you? You know, the one where a mean-spirited prince is cursed to appear as an ugly beast until he learns to love another and is loved by her in return? In the modern day fable ""Penelope"", a similar concept is given a gender reversal and a few plot trimmings of its own. The result is a decent little film, engaging enough to be worthy of a look despite its unambitious and fairly predictable narrative.",/review/rw6546437/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2008,Robert_duder,8," Sugary sweet and cute...a modern day fairy tale that might give you cavities
","Plain and simple Penelope is a fairy tale...period. It has a moral, cute character, romance, adventure and really is meant mostly to speak to kids because the moral doesn't really speak out beyond the level of a young child. That's not to say it's not important just that it doesn't really speak to adults in the same way that it does to kids. As cute and good as the movie is because it is very entertaining...it's fluff at it's finest. Nothing that really digs at your brain or makes you think about for hours after but rather something to occupy your time for an hour and a half and then mostly forgettable. I mean even the romance aspect of it is kind of done half heartedly. It's not really a passionate romance but something that grows slightly and is a way of closing the film in the end. It's something that seemed necessary so it's thrown in there for good measure. I sound as though I'm bad mouthing but I'm really not...I truly did enjoy the film and had some very good performances but all in all it was just very, very fluffy and just didn't have a lot of depth no matter how entertaining it seemed. It was cute and funny, with plenty of touching moments.",/review/rw6546437/?ref_=tt_urv

","PENELOPE may at first glance seem like one of the few summer releases on DVD to merit watching, but though the selections on the shelves are inexplicably thin, this little modern day fable is so well made that it deserves wide attention.

6 October 2009,Buddy-51,5," blandly predictable modern-day fairy tale
","Due to a curse that was placed on her family in the 19th Century, an otherwise attractive British high society blueblood by the name of Penelope Wilhern was born with pigs' ears and a snout. This, as one would imagine, has put something of a damper on the poor girl's dating life, since prospective romantic partners invariably run screaming out of the room the moment they first lay eyes on her. Enter Johnny, a scruffy, down-on-his-luck compulsive gambler hired by an investigative reporter to infiltrate Penelope's house to see if the rumors of a pig-nosed girl residing therein are indeed true. But can this principled cad help falling in love with the ""real,"" ""beautiful"" Penelope who lies just beneath the surface of this grotesquely swinish exterior? (Though, if truth be told, if you're going to be stuck going through life with a pig-nose, you could do a lot worse than the one Penelope is forced to put up with here).
