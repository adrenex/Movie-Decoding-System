25 August 2006,blanbrn,8," Support the underdog, after the movie you will smile!
","After just seeing ""Invincible"" I must say thumbs up! Way to go that finally after 30 years this true story is brought to the big screen. Call me bias or partial because I'm an Eagles fan, but the story of any underdog making an NFL team makes you happy. 30 year old bartender and part-time school teacher Vince Papale who finds life a struggle from his wife leaving him, to problems paying his bills he finds only one hope that is to escape thru his love and passion for the Eagles. Papale a season ticket holder and sandlot football star decides to give himself a shot at a better life in 1976 when newly hired coach Dick Vermil decides to hold open tryouts. Papale has the odds stacked against him, but thru his will and determination to make it, because no one ever expected him to do anything he prevails! Papale lands a roster spot as a special teams player a blue-collar guy doing blue collar work on the field. The scenes and background of this movie, especially the way Veterans Stadium is shown is sketchy and unbelievable, but the story is true and touching. Vince Papale played for the Eagles for three seasons, well acted and done by Mark Wahlberg who showed enthusiasm with this role. Also Greg Kinnear is great as legendary head coach Dick Vermeil, overall a great movie of an underdog that leaves you smiling at the end. I hope more real-life NFL movies are made about players, because ""Invincible"" sets the standard.",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2006,mrcaw1,8," Quality film making from Disney
",Really enjoyed this film. Went with my almost 13 year old son who is just starting his first participation in organized football in school and I think the film really inspired him.,/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2006,ruby_fff,8," Wahlberg and Kinnear seem so easy wearing their roles naturally in this NFL sanctioned film about Philadelphia Eagles' Vince Papale and Coach Dick Vermeil
","Both Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear are such naturals in delivering their characters. When in fact, from the production notes, Wahlberg went through actual football training/coaching, being there with the team for every play and practice, gaining insight into his portrayal of a real living person. Both met their inspired 'hero'. For Kinnear, he received confirmation when Vermeil's son indicated that he got his father's mannerism/cadence spot on. The operative word here is 'genuine,' caring and intensely so. They worked hard preparing and learning to correctly portray the two NFL notables.",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2006,editor-299,7," Good film with a terrific soundtrack
","Never underestimate the power of a good story, decent acting and a great soundtrack. That's what Disney's ""Invincible,"" starring Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear, brings to viewers. The studio has made some decent sports entries, including ""Remember The Titans,"" and last's year's golf film, ""The Greatest game Ever Played,"" so they know their stuff.",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2006,foolishewe,8," Good Story telling, brings back memories
","I just came from and advanced screening tonight and it was an entertaining feel-good movie. The movie is based on a true ""local guy makes good"" story, and quite entertaining (although after searching online for Papale, it appears that they may have taken a bit of dramatic license with some of the details). The story telling and acting were good. I think Kinnear's presentation of Dick Vermeil (I remember seeing Vermeil on the local T.V. a lot back then) was outstanding. Mark Wahlberg gave a credible performance as a determined underdog here, he seems to be maturing as an actor, and from what I could tell was in good physical condition to play this role. Kirk Acevado and Mark Raspoli put in good supporting performances as (sometime) supportive friends and relatives. The movie is an O.K. family movie if you don't mind a bit of swearing and sports/football violence (tackles, blocks and those sorts of things).",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2006,tavm,8," Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear are inspirational in Invincible
","I have a friend here in Baton Rouge, La. who was very anxious to see this movie, so for his 38th birthday (which was actually on August 22) I decided to take him to this and pay all admission and concession. From the beginning with Jim Croce's ""I Got a Name"" to the exciting end with Vince Papale's triumphant touchdown in his first regular home game, this was one inspirational movie! Mark Wahlberg does a fine job portraying the sad-sack Philadelphian. Greg Kinnear is equally good as a former college football coach taking a chance on an only ""open tryout"" player who only did high school games. The best scenes are the ones taking place during the first regular season game at the Dallas Cowboy stadium and then the first regular home game opposite the New York Giants (which Vince's girlfriend Janet supports!). By the way, my birthday friend really enjoyed this movie so on his and my recommendation, by all means seek this one out!",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2006,pookey56,8," male bonding
","Despite Mark Wahlberg's reputation as a person, i am a fan of his films and his work, and he didn't disappoint me in Invincible. The film had a way of bringing my age home, since i remember Vince Papale, how bad the Eagles were, Dick Vermeil and of course, the infamous Tom Landry, so this film was nostalgic for me. I recall the music of that time too, and, thankfully, i didn't notice any disco. I expected to see an inspiring football film, and for the most part, it was. But it had something else i really wasn't expecting, which for me was the essence of this film, and that was, camaraderie, support, atmosphere, and friendship. I was happy to see Michael Kelly too, the seeming A**h** who turned out to be a courageous, self-sacrificing guy in Dawn of the Dead (remake).I am not a fan at all of Ericson Core's other projects, with the exception of The Fast and the Furious, and i noticed that he was the cinematographer as well as the directer here. He did a good job. There were certain touches which i appreciated, such as the sequence where Vince was driving around trying to find some inspiration. He saw a young boy playing football with his number, 83, taped on his back; and he saw his friends playing football in the mud, a long-held tradition amid the backdrop of unemployment, strikes, and hard times in a working class city with gutsy people. One could argue that yes, this film was very formulaic. But the film was ""inspired"" by a real person; a son of Philadelphia; the city's biggest fan. I feel the film could have used another five minutes or so at the end, for a less abrupt denouement; but perhaps it was because Invincible was about courage, determination, the American dream, family and friends. Those aspects came through very well, even in spite of Papale's life-long struggles with self confidence and esteem. I'd recommend this film for most people. Not just football fans.",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2006,redmama34,7," From A Philly Boy - A Feel Good Story That Does A Good Job Recreating 70's Philly Life
","First off - I'm biased. Let me get that out of the way first. I grew up in Center City Philly during the 70's and am a life-long Eagles fan. So, I was pretty excited to see the movie to get juiced for the upcoming 2006 Eagles season while also hoping to relive Philly life from 1976.",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2007,ReelCheese,6," Standard Underdog Pic
","Somewhat loosely based on a true story, INVINCIBLE is your standard root-for-the-underdog sports movie, nothing more, nothing less. Mark Wahlberg is Vince Papale, a beefy touch football player/bartender who struts his stuff at an open tryout for the Philadelphia Eagles. Overcoming tremendous odds, Papale cracks the roster after earning the faith of rookie coach Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear).",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2007,MLDinTN,5," another you can do anything you set your mind too movie
","This story is very uplifting. It's about a 30 year old bartender/layed off teacher, whose wife just left him. He tries out for the Philadelphia Eagles and against all odds, makes the team. Coach Vermeil sticks with Vince because he's got heart, even though his assistant coaches think he should be cut. Vince goes on to play several years in the NFL.",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2019,elgrampo77,7," A feel-good sports movie
","Of course it is not a Oscar Level script or performance but after watching it you just have to feel good.
Mark Wahlbergs acting is well suited for the figure he is depicting.",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2006,gradyharp,5," Yet Another Sports Film About Personal Triumph
","INVINCIBLE, though the title of this very Walt Disney/Hallmark Card docudrama, is a term that could be applied to the plethora of movies built on the stories of down and outers who pull themselves up by the boot strings due to their success in sports. Brad Gann is responsible for the script of the life of Vince Papale, a 30ish out of work substitute teacher, deserted husband, depressed South Philly member of a gang of friends who pass the time while jobless playing football in the muddy vacant lots of their part of the world.",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2006,pjh0704,10," Such a great film
","I gave this film a 10 rating which is highly unusual for me. But, upon reflection, I could find NOTHING wrong with it. The actors are perfectly cast. The musical score is great at transporting you back to the day. The scripting is wonderfully low-key and seemingly true to life. There is no overwhelming sentimentality, yet there is also no unnecessary violence or foul language. In short, it's perfect.",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2006,jenld1029,10," Great Underdog Story!
","Not just for Philadelphia Eagles fans, but for all sports fans who love a great underdog story. Watching this film, I was transported back to the gritty streets of South Philly in 1976, watching the impossible dream unfold for a guy down on his luck, but determined to change his life with his love for football -- and for his favorite team, the Eagles. Mark Wahlberg did an excellent job playing the improbable hero Vince Papale. The supporting cast is also very good, with a great turn by Elizabeth Banks, who believes in Vince's dream of making it in the NFL. It shows that with hard work and determination, anything is possible. A film for the whole family to enjoy!",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv

26 May 2007,mcsheehey,4," Uninspired and Uninspiring
","From the time I saw the first preview for ""Invincible,"" I was very excited to see it. I loved ""Remember the Titans,"" and this seemed to be that kind of movie: a sports film with a good cast that alters the mold and tries something new and interesting. Perhaps this is the reason that ""Invincible"" proved to be such a disappointment for me.",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2006,ferguson-6,6," Rocky in Pads
","Greetings again from the darkness. Disney throws us another inspirational true story ... this time about South Philly's Vince Papale, a local bartender who was a walk-on cult hero for the Philadelphia Eagles in the late 1970's. Think ""Rudy"" in South Philly or ""Rocky"" in football pads.",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2014,SnoopyStyle,7," It's no Rudy but it works
","It's 1976 after another horrible season, the Philadelphia Eagles hires couch Dick Vermeil (Greg Kinnear). To shake things up, he announces an open tryout. Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg) is a struggling 30 year old part time teacher. He gets fired with the latest cutback and his wife leaves him. He reluctantly goes to the tryout.",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2006,TxMike,," Really fine movie based on Vince Papale's entry into pro football.
","I am about Vince Papale's age. I very vaguely remember in 1976 when he began to play pro football for the Eagles. I invariably enjoy movies based on real people, and this is no exception to that rule. Mark Wahlberg doesn't look much like Papale at 30, and is a bit too old, but his working class background helped him become Papale for this movie. A very worthwhile viewing for anyone who likes a nice personal triumph. There is a very interesting 25-minute extra on the DVD which features the real Papale as they were making the movie.",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2006,michaelRokeefe,7," Inspirational and hard hitting true story.
","A feel-good movie if there ever was one. The true story of Vince Papale(Mark Wahlberg), a down and almost out 30-something, getting the chance to live a dream. Papale's wife just left; he lost his substitute teaching job and was hanging on as a part-time bartender. Like most guys growing up in south Philly; you live and die with the hometown Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles glory days have slipped away and a new coach, Dick Vermeil(Greg Kinnear), has something to prove. And to shake things up he calls for an open tryout to make the team. Papale, who never played college ball, not only makes the cut...he would go on to play for the Philadelphia Eagles for three years. The scrappy underdog helped the team rally the hometown and restore its pride in its NFL team. ",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2017,SimonJack,8," Very good sports drama set on the Philadelphia gridiron
","Based on a true story, ""Invincible"" is a first-rate sports drama. Touted as the story of a 30-year-old bartender who becomes a pro football players for the Philadelphia Eagles, the film actually is two stories in one. ",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2006,bobm5508,8," The ""nicest"" football movie you'll ever see!!
","This is a very entertaining, almost sweet movie, about the ""true story"" of a local Philly fan who actually makes the Eagles squad in the mid-70s. This has the Disney stamp of wholesome and I found it to be refreshing. A football locker room or practice field can fill up with expletives, but I recall only one scene where a friend is excited that ""...you made the freaking Eagles"". After being assaulted with ""realistic"" movies, HBO's ""The Sopranos"" or Showtime's ""The Brotherhood"", the toned down language was a welcomed change.",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2018,cricketbat,6," This is the Western Family version of Rudy.
","Invincible is a pretty standard ""inspirational sports movie."" It has all of the familiar characters, plot lines and dialogue that we have grown accustomed to in movies like this. This is the Western Family version of Rudy. It's not exceptional, just acceptable. Plus, I was surprised to find out how much this movie differs from the actual life of Vince Papale.",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2006,Robert_duder,9," How does Disney keep doing this!! I love it!!
","Miracle, The Greatest Game Ever Played and NOW THIS!! I don't even like Football but Invincible is the perfect feel good film. Right out of the gate I must say that I do not agree with it's ""G"" rating. How can something like The Incredibles get a PG rating for violence and intense scenes but Invincible with a love scene, a scene of someone giving the middle finger twice, and a lot of violent football scenes gets a G?? There is no justice to the MPAA. BUT that being said Invincible truly is a story about overcoming fears and heroism and the film reminded me a great deal of the closest thing to Rocky I that has ever been done and yet that's a big compliment. First and foremost this film also takes place in Phillidelphia in the seventies so the setting and time feels very familiar to Rocky fans. You have a neighborhood guy that the entire city gets behind and all their dreams are in him. I am not a football fan but you honestly don't need to be. You will still find yourself rooting for this underdog. You also have a sub-plot of a serious recession that is taking it's toll on everyone in the lower income areas of Philly. You have a ""family"", a group of friends so close that spend their time at a local pub and lean on each other in the rough times.",/review/rw1462067/?ref_=tt_urv
