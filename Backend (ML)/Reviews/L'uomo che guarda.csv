",When Uncharted was first released back in 2007 it initially came under fire as a Tomb Raider clone. Critics said based on the trailers that it looked like Lara Croft had a sex change and that it would lack originality.,/review/rw6500556/?ref_=tt_urv

21 December 2009,honorhorror,10," The game that restored the confidence of PS3.
","Uncharted 2 Among Thieves may well be the best PS3 game to date, although such a compliment will raise the skepticism of both XBOX fans and some MGS fans in your living room.",/review/rw6500556/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2009,opponent69,10," Amazing Game
","I had to give this game a 10. I really enjoyed this game, even more than I enjoyed Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. The nice thing about the new game is that the graphics and cut-scenes are to die for. Also, there is an auto target option which eases your misery of targeting enemies. If you are a fan of adventure and thriller games, this is definitely the game for you. All new characters that will make the story even more interesting and also, the music used is amazing.",/review/rw6500556/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2009,Brimst1,9," A must-have for every PS3 owner..
","Uncharted 2 has easily been this years most anticipated title for the PS3. Not only because of the mind-blowing presentation Naughty Dog gave the gaming-press during the E3 event, but also because of the games' predecessor with which, despite having it's share of mistakes, they've set a pretty high standard for themselves.",/review/rw6500556/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2010,Aaron1375,10," It's like they read my review of the first game and addressed my complaints.
","I enjoyed the first game, but gave it a score of eight. This one though gets a ten as almost all my complaints from the first game have been erased and the only complaints I have about this one are way to minor to make me lower the score as the plot in this one was simply to excellent to be marred by a few control issues I had at times. Basically, I will address my main complaint right off the bat, at times the character of Nathan was kind of jerky in his controls, nothing major, but in certain areas it was noticeable. The plot has Nathan in a rather bad predicament right off the bat and through flashbacks we see how the hero ended up in this rather bad mess. He apparently joined an old friend and an old lover on a quest to go after a long lost treasure of Marco Polo. Well he gets double crossed by this friend and ends up in prison where he is bailed out by his old friend from the first game Sullie. Well he decides to go after the treasure as the old lover is also there and she and Sullie convince him to go after the treasure being hunted by a notorious man named Lazorivich (pretty sure I spelled that wrong). Well the game goes here and there as Nate must maneuver through a war torn city, have a very cool train fight scene, and end up in the mountains in search of treasure. At times I was thinking ""why the heck can't they make movies this good?"" Nathan is also a very funny and great video game character and it was nice to see a couple of familiar faces back from the previous game. The humor is so good to, if you jump into a pool on a rooftop Nate and Chloe (the former lover) have a very humorous exchange. As for the game play it has some exploring type stuff such as one would expect in a Tomb Raider game and it has a lot of shoot em ups. However, this one also added some really fun stealth fighting too as I really enjoyed say pushing a soldier from behind off a cliff. So a great game and sequel and better than most movies you will see these days.",/review/rw6500556/?ref_=tt_urv

30 January 2010,luke5119,10," Nathan Drake is Indiana Jones
","This game is great to say the least and is a awesome modern day adaption of the infamous Indiana Jones film; for a game of course. Granted some call it a rip off of the Indy series, I call it picking up where Indy left off. Nolan North does a great job voicing the character Nathan Drake and his dialogue is superb; very realistic. I've read reports of a film adaption for the first game. Personally I'd love to see Nolan North play Nathan Drake in the movie. If the fans reviews of the Drake series are any consolation, the film will be a hit. I think a BIG part of the Drake Series success is highly in part do to the fact SCEA is the maker of the games. Sony Computer Entertaimnet America or SCEA, the creators of the Playstion 3 system essentially, know how to make PS3 games better than anyone pretty much. Why's that you ask? They know how to build a game to it's strengths. Working with what they know the system is capable of and making sure the layout of the buttons is easy to get used to. This is grade A gaming in my eyes. Action, Adventure, Great Story Line, and some humor mixed in to boot. This series is great and is only getting better.",/review/rw6500556/?ref_=tt_urv

","Simply put, this game was a stone-cold console seller. Many who only owned Xbox 360s were biting the bullet and purchasing a PS3 to play this game. The hype was real, and it not only managed to exceed it, it KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK!",/review/rw6500556/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2010,CuriosityKilledShawn,9," One of the best PS3 games
","I enjoyed the original Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, but it lacked the certain spark necessary to make it an instant classic. This sequel takes everything that was great about the first game and enhances it tenfold. The graphics, sound design, gameplay and voice acting are all near-perfect. It's just a shame that there's not much replay value to the game as it's rather easy to finish.",/review/rw6500556/?ref_=tt_urv

","This game have you at the edge of your seat every time you encounter something. The game does its own things but you are in for a ride. It one of the best experience game on the PS3, which leave the players wanting more. I can see why this is everyone's favorite Uncharted game and I think in some ways, it's better than Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. The story is pretty simple but very well executed, the characters are very memorable and amazing, the gameplay was top notch and got better since the first game, and the graphics still looks great to this day. No wondered why this game was Game of the Year of 2009.",/review/rw6500556/?ref_=tt_urv

26 June 2018,vivifan,10," One of the best Action Adventure games out there and how A sequal should be done
","Uncharted 2 is one of the best examples of how to make a sequel. The original uncharted while a good game in it's own way was flawed in certain places to prevent it from becoming a classic. It was good start to the series with a decent story, good characters and solid presentation all around but the villain was forgettable and gameplay got old really quickly. Uncharted 2 takes everything about the first one and completely destroys it in everyway. It's a lot more epic with it's set pieces, the storyline is more engaging, the characters and voice acting is stronger and the overall gameplay is a lot more fun. One of my favorite games of all time hands down since the replay value is really high. There's a lot more treasures to find, the game is longer and bigger, the gunplay feels better, the villain from this game is a lot more threating and memorable then the first games. Everything in this game is perfect and is the best game in the entire series. If you haven't played this game yet then what the heck are you waiting for?! Play it now!",/review/rw6500556/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2018,Gamesearcher1,9," How to do a sequel.
","It's 2008 and you're Naughty Dog. After the success of your first game, which did have its flaws, but was still a very enjoyable experience. So what do you do? Set everything to 11 was the answer. And I'm not even kidding. Firstly, the combat is so much more fluid. The number of weapons in the game feel like they were doubled, and combat is much more refined. Cover-shooting feels a choice you can have, but the game also allows for a more aggressive play-style, something I absolutely love. The game's main problem is the frequency of enemies that just eat up your bullets. For anyone who has played the game, the word 'train boss' will ring true to that statement. In terms of narrative, its much more sporadic than the first game, but overall it still holds itself well. The writing is some of the best in a video game, all of the characters, recurring or new, are distinct, memorable and everything else you want a character to be. The voice acting is also just as good as the previous game. It looks substantially better than the first game, and it uses this to great use in its unforgettable set-pieces, beginning from the first time you press 'Start', and it also uses tension a whole lot. Musically, the game is a ramp-up from its predecessor's mediocre music, but still isn't something I'd listen to after the credits rolled. The climbing is extremely fluid, the puzzles are good and this is the only game in the Uncharted trilogy to master the precise controls required of a game. All-in-all, this game cements itself as an absolute must-play. Few games can get you as pumped as this game.",/review/rw6500556/?ref_=tt_urv

","i never played the original uncharted. so when i played uncharted 2 i didn't know what to expect and i was blown away by this MASTERPIECE and these are reasons why uncharted 2 is my favorite game GRAPHICS: back in 2009 i have never seen anything like it before it's just gorgeous no more words. and i believe that it still hold up fairly well. GAMEPLAY: uncharted 2 is a special game because of it's multiple game play styles you have cover based shooting, platforming,hand to hand combat, puzzle solving,stealth and they are all done really well. STORY: i honestly don't care about stories in video games but uncharted 2 story kept me waiting too see what's gonna happen next and most games don't do that for me and the voice acting is incredible. SET PIECES: OMFG is what sums uncharted 2 unbelievably epic moments i wont spoil anything but man they blew me away so there you have it uncharted is my favorite game of all time for these reasons.",/review/rw6500556/?ref_=tt_urv
