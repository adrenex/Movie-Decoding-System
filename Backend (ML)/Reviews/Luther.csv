29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Great Detective Series!
","I can't say enough about how much I loved Luther, it was such a terrific show. It's about a terrific detective who always figures out even the hardest of cases and the dangers that come with it. He's like a modern day Sherlock Holmes. I've watched the entire series twice through and can't say enough about how good it is, especially Idris Elba as the lead. He's such a great actor and has given so many great performances throughout his career but I have to say that Luther is his best one. Ruth Wilson (Alice) is also brilliant in this show and holds her own with Elba. This is not your normal cop or detective show, it's so much better than that. It's gritty, raw, and sometimes violent. Each episode is so good it will seem like it flew by. I can not recommend this show enough.",/review/rw8699977/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2022,Supermanfan-13,9," Excellent!
",Luther is an excellent show that absolutely lives up to all the hype! Idris Elba is fantastic as Luther and the rest of the cast is also impressive! This last season wasn't as good as the previous ones but it was still worth watching. God knows there are a thousand detective shows to choose from out there but Luther really is one of the better ones available!,/review/rw8699977/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2022,kyrross,8," would be perfect but..
","Each season, there is a cop or a team dedicated to bring Luther down. They waste so much time, money and effort on this. It is like they are tripping on their own show. I get it, it add more tension... will they get him? But I really much rather have more focus on the real murderer. Luther get the job done, he catched bad guys. But no, they MUST stop him because he doesnt follow the rules. They really got and hard on on the fact they will eventually dig enough dirt on Luther.... but why?? It stain the real investigation and force an other intrigue. It really drag the show down. I love Edris Elba. Each second with him on screen is a blast. But stop with those jealous colleagues !",/review/rw8699977/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Interesting, compelling and absorbing
","Now I love detective series, and tuned in to Luther expecting something interesting. And did I get that? Yes I did and even more than that. It mayn't be the best programme ever, but over the past six weeks or so it was one of the better programmes airing.",/review/rw8699977/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2020,ahmedgorshy,10," Luther Review
","This series is unlike any other series you will see and I will explain in a few small reasons why.
First, the series seems very traditional in the beginning, and the acting seems strange, and I did not think I would want to complete it, but I was shocked by the improvement that occurs from the first episode in the first season to the last of the season, and the development continues in everything in the story and events and the representation of Idris Elba, which improves in each episode and Every season. The series reaches its climax in the third season and whoever does not follow it has wasted a lot of his or her life.
My favorite character is Alice, she is the best character in the show.
I am sad and worried that the show may come out from the list of the best in AMDB, but as you know the fifth season is weak, but this is the case for all series.
My rating for each season is as follows
The first season was held at 8.9 out of 10
The second season I give it 9.0
Season three I give it 9.7 out of 10
Season 4 i give it 8.5
Season 5 i give it 7.0
The show is relly good",/review/rw8699977/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2010,cfisanick,10," Crazy, unhinged, but great show
","What's remarkable about ""Luther"" is how series creator Neil Cross takes a rag-tag bag of clichÃ©s--brilliant but damaged rogue cop, long-suffering boss, genius killer, etc.--and makes it all seem so fresh. Of course, having the fantastic Idris Elba helps immeasurably. He doesn't just act the part of Luther; he is Luther, fully inhabiting the role and moving like a force of nature through every scene. This is one of those rare times where you see an actor's innate intelligence and physicality used perfectly. (Watching Luther decompensate, as he does at various times over the story arc, is really something to see.) Elba is matched every step of the way by Ruth Wilson, playing a sort of female Hannibal Lector--brilliant, amoral, remorseless, scary, and, I daresay, sexy. She and Elba make quite a pair, and their interplay is priceless.",/review/rw8699977/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2022,heidibingham,8," A British series made for American TV
","I was really looking forward to another 'line of duty' type show. I'll admit, I couldn't stop watching even though the storyline in the first series isn't realistic. First, we have so few serial killers in the UK that having multiple in the 1st series was a but much and Alice literally gets away with multiple crimes without anyone raising an eyebrow or remotely questioning her!",/review/rw8699977/?ref_=tt_urv

30 October 2010,zaenkney,9," Luther will discombobulate you...but, in a good way!!!
","""Luther"" the new BBC detective series lead by Idris Elba as DCI John Luther, is a riveting watch. This character, Luther, is a loose cannon primed to fire at will or by wonder, yet this detective's intelligence and focus seems to keep him charging in the right direction. He and fellow officers appear to work on a rather intuitive level and their ability to relate to us 'common folk' and our reaction to injustice, is a magnetizing factor.

11 June 2010,flam99,10," Wow, stumbled upon this show by chance but I'm very grateful I did
","Let me be clear, I despise police or detective shows. It just doesn't do it for me. They throw in a new criminal each episode to fill up most of the time and add a little bit of main story progression at the very end of the episode, leaving it to the season finale to wrap things up in ONE good episode.",/review/rw8699977/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2014,A_Different_Drummer,7," If you read the other reviews CAREFULLY...
","As a viewer, you have rights. No one reads you your rights at the start of each show but, trust me, you have them anyway. One of those rights is that you don't NEED to read the reviews to enjoy a show; and, if you do, you certainly don't need to read them extra carefully. But this show is an exception. If you do choose to read the reviews -- including the mainstream reviews which IMDb so graciously provides -- you will notice recurring references to ""escapist entertainment"" and other terms to that effect. WHAT'S THAT ABOUT? Well, let us toddle off to the first or pilot episode and have a closer look, shall we?? At one of the key or defining moments in this story, Luther, convinced that the proof of his ""theory"" lies in the cremation vase containing the ashes of Alice's parents' dead dog, breaks into her flat, opens the vase and - PRESTO -- indeed finds pieces of a Glock pistol inside the vase. He is so excited about this that, even though he has no intention of actually arresting her, even though the search is illegal, he confronts Alice deliberately and shows her the find. Now the good news is that this behavior sets the tone for the entire series and is very useful to the viewer. The bad news is that it is nonsense. Standard procedure at crematoriums is to fill the vases by hand in order to bypass bits of unburnt bone which, logic dictates, might be somewhat upsetting to relatives. So for the writers to presume that actual pieces of the mechanism of a gun would be nonchalantly passed on to the next of kin is (are you ahead of me?) escapist and fanciful. If you can overlook that flaw -- Sherlock Holmes this is not! -- it's an engaging show, part of the ""new breed"" of shows where the hero has some sort of off-putting character trait (Doc Martin, House) and an extension of the theme introduced in Silence of the Lambs where it is entirely normal and proper to consult known sociopaths to gain insight on other crimes. Good show, yes. Great show, I am frankly not sure.",/review/rw8699977/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2015,stuart_davies,5," I laughed out loud at the stupidity of the plot
","Series 1 started off great with first four episode based plots being well put together and told with only the the lingering annoyance of the nemesis astrophysicist murderer that got away muddying what is otherwise a great show. Perhaps I'm getting a bit cynical as I get older but overuse of the keeping secrets causing bad situations story line just got tiresome after its use went into double figures. The final straw for me was when episode 5 crashed and burned, with stupid characters and plot twists that were too contrived to be believable... breaking the chain of evidence on one case to prove another being just one in a string of moronic plot artefacts... with the shooting at the end making me laugh out loud it was so ridiculous, never mind the aftermath set-up of course resulted in the hero being blamed for the murder... simply a reworking of many an over done detective show with no originality. Production was good and the acting was rock solid but the descent into absurdity of episode 5 just put me off watching episode 6 or the other two series in the box set.",/review/rw8699977/?ref_=tt_urv

","Okay, it's been a while since i actually saw a series I liked so much. England doesn't churn out amazing movies or TV programmes by the dozen, but when they get 'em right, they get 'em perfect. And Luther is one of those gems.",/review/rw8699977/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2013,Lejink,5," Superman and Luther
","I see the high rating here for this series and quite a lot of fuss was kicked up in anticipation of the third series just started on BBC1, so I thought I'd go back and see what it was all about. Well, I'm puzzled actually. Idris Elba plays John Luther, the epitome of the maverick cop who seems to have hired his persona from any number of tough American prototypes, certainly he seems nothing like any British cop you'd ever imagine on the job. And of course he has troubles, including a ferocious temper, a disregard for authority or playing by the rules and naturally problems with his marriage. Ahh, but of course he's a brilliantly instinctive deductive cop, a lone wolf only happy apparently when he's pitting his wits against some devious serial-killer, cavalierly putting himself and his wife into danger to ensnare his prey. This first episode kicked off with a gruesome family murder, including the pet dog, with Luther naturally identifying the very obvious killer within seconds of his first interview with the suspect. It only gets more improbable from there as he engages in a treacherous game of cat and mouse with the murderer before of course his hunches are vindicated and he triumphs in the end. All I really saw here was clichÃ©, exaggeration and unreality. Sly Stallone could have played the lead role, so cartoonish was his character. There was little or no humour at play either which worries me as it makes me suspect the producers perhaps think this is a gritty police procedural. As for the acting, again like the rest of the production, this too seemed over-zealous and unconvincing. I will watch the follow-up episodes although my interest has dimmed to curiosity but something (things) will have to change significantly if I'm to catch up with the new series just airing.",/review/rw8699977/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2022,chitrangada_pal,8," Very engaging
","If youua fan of detective thriller like me then this is a must watch show. The casting is fantastic. Though the storyline fails at few points, but I was able to overlook that because of the wonderful performance. Idris Elba is phenomenal, his body language, voice and the entire look ( the special jacket and grey shiirts) are simply outstanding. A character to remember. I wish to see Idris Elba again as Luther.",/review/rw8699977/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2010,Dechilo,10," Fantastic action-packed police drama.
","I have watched countless TV shows from the US and the UK and this is by far one of the better written shows. It is not fully packed of twists and turns but the actor who plays 'Alice' is pure evil genius. She alone takes the show from being 'just good' to fantastic! Overall it is worth watching and much better than any other police show I have found in recent years, with a possible exception of 'Dexter' (US TV show).",/review/rw8699977/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2020,iulianturicianu,1," Hmm no
","As soon as in the first episode the main character stormed out of the interrogation room and told everyone she was the killer because she didn't yawn, I was like... whaaat? Afterwards I could only force myself to watch another episode and had to give it up. Idris Elba's character is very unlikable, has serious anger management issues and is just overall irritating.

","I watch all episodes of Luther at least once a year. It just has something about it. It's the old school that the show possesses that makes it interesting, it's John Luther that keeps it interesting. The connection between two of the leading characters; Luther & Alice Morgan, is dark and difficult. It makes you keep your eyes fixed to what's happening, and you don't want to miss a thing.
