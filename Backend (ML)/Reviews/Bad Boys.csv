21 January 2018,gogoschka-1,8," A Raunchy, Hilarious Stew Cooked Up From The Plot Ingredients Of Every Sci-Fi Film You Ever Saw
","I stumbled upon this show more or less by accident, and I'm honestly surprised it seems to have flown a bit under the radar, given it was produced by Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen. But I'm glad I did check it out; this hilarious, over the top romp was a blast from start to finish. Let me warn you, though: it's a bit of an acquired taste and certainly not for everyone. But if you like the sort of raunchy humor the Rogen/Goldberg brand usually stands for, AND you're a fan of the most iconic sci-fi blockbusters that came out over the last 30 years, chances are you're going to love it.",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Pretty Funny!
",Future Man was so much better than I expected it to be. It literally had me laughing out loud several times per episode. It's about the love of a boring janitor named Josh Futterman (Joel Hutcherson) whose entire life is playing video games. When he beats an unbeatable game some mysterious visitors from the future show up (Derek Wilson and Eliza Coupe). They say the world is in danger and Josh is the only one who can save it. He travels through time with them as they do everything they can save Earth from aliens trying to take over. I promise that if you give this show a chance you will not be sorry! It's not the best comedy series I've ever seen but it's definitely one of the more underrated comedies I've ever seen.,/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2020,Supermanfan-13,8," Just started watching it and it's hilarious!
","I can't believe that I've been putting off watching Future Man for so long, I guess it's because the trailers just made it look ok. I just now finally starting watching it and man, am I glad I did. It's hilarious! Everyone is funny but it's Derek Wilson (Wolf) that really shines and steals the show! I've never seen him in anything else but he's the star of this show and has a bright future! Give this show a chance...you will not be sorry!",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2022,SnoopyStyle,7," ridiculous fun stupidity
","Josh Futturman (Josh Hutcherson) is a lowly janitor at a biotech company run by Doctor Elias Kronish (Keith David). He lives at home with his parents (Ed Begley, Jr., Glenne Headly) and spends all his spare time playing a video game called Biotic Wars. When he finally defeats the game, he finds himself face to face with characters in the game, Tiger (Eliza Coupe) and Wolf (Derek Wilson). They tell him that the game is a simulation from a dystopian future world and that Kronish's work created the savage future. They expected Josh to have super human skills but is shocked to find a scrawny nerd.",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2017,terrencepatrix,8," Pretty hilarious
","My score is based on what the show is trying to be, which is loosely a sci-fi with a bunch of ridiculous inept characters. It's main gimmick is time travel utilized to stop a dystopia future from taking place. Two of our main protagonists, Tiger & Wolf, send a game back in time with the idea that the individual who beats it will be their savior. Right, like 'The Last Starfighter', which the main character Hutchinson immediately points out which should cue you in as to what kind of show you're in for. ",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2017,Smarmelade,10," Not perfect, but kinda great
","I was to give this a 9 out of 10, just because I went to sleep after watching this having a huge sh!t eating grin on my face, which I can't remember was the last time it happened. But I'm trying to be objective here.",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2022,shellmine,8," Entertaining and Different
","This show is great. Starts out strong, weakens in season 2, then concludes well in season 3. It feels very unique, sometimes alienating but it's too irreverent to get offended by. Watch this if you're bored with the usual stuff and are craving something very weird and surprising.",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2022,cgry46,9," Seen it all
",I love this one. It's the best and it's got a great story and characters you can invest in. You can also take in the raunchiness of everything too which is great. A funny funny one too. Can't wait until the next one comes out.,/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2020,jackstab,7," We Liked this series
","My husband and I watched all three seasons recently and enjoyed it mostly. Season 1 was definitely the best out of the 3.
I loved the three main characters but I have to say that in season 3 when Seth Rogan arrives on the scene... standing O. I've watched a lot of his work... and if you ever read this Seth, this was your finest work to date ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2020,katharath,9," Not for dumb dumbs!
","This is a solid little show. I was very pleasantly surprised by just how good it is; the negative reviews are all from people who clearly don't appreciate how clever it actually is. I'm a huge fan of time travel fiction, and this is just the right blend of sci fi meets comedy...give it a go. It took me about 3-4 epis to get hooked but then I was in, and season two was even better than one, imo!! The characters get better and better, you just need to give them a chance to grow on you!! Enjoyable stuff. **Edited to add: I wrote this review before season 3 came out. I just wanted to add that season three continued the tradition of excellency; I'm upping my overall rating from an 8 to a 9, and may I add that this show is well worth a rewatch!!",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2017,colonnesel,10," Oh my - this is it - best new show of the year
","Just when you thought you couldn't get a better TV year, what with the likes of The Orville, then something like Future Man comes along.",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2017,DaFunkyBeatz,9," Time-travel done right!! (No rules, just fun!!)
","With all the *bad* ""kid ends up in a 'real life' video game""-type movies out there, I was hesitant after watching one of the early trailers. But with Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg attached, I figured I'd at least try one episode.",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2020,imrigu,8," Season 1 fun, Season 2 awesome, Season 3 Great
","Just finished season 1, it was totally awesome and fun watching. I had watched all the episodes continuously till the end of season 1, so there were moments i felt it's not moving forward at the same pace but after the ending i definitely felt good. It was totally satisfying to watch.",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2022,afwuest,10," Goddamn Art
","Words fail me. This has been exhilarating. Rarely have laughed out loud this often when watching a show. The amount of love and crazy ideas, that have gone into this would be enough for several shows. Watch this!",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2021,cherold,8," hilarious insanity, even though season two is a let down
","Future Man starts when nebbish Josh beats an unbeatable video game only to learn it's a recruiting device from the future. He is recruited by battle-hardened warriors Tiger and Wolf, who quickly discover that video game expertise does not a leader make. They then make various desperate attempts to stop a coming war, all of which go terribly wrong, often *because* of Josh.",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2020,MajorBaleegh,5," Good Start Useless Finish
","I started watching with great keenness and enthusiasm the first season was marvelous, I really took me with it and I enjoyed a lot, the to and fro going forward and backwards in time was excellent idea and was shown perfectly. As the first season ends all hell broke loose and with the commencement of season 2 the same show started repeating it again took away all the pleasure with it. The second season was a rubbish and dark and kind of boring with undue nudity really makes me feel sick. I advise to watch only season 1 and the rest should not be viewed as it will take away all the good from season 1",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2020,kshutch-16590,8," Crazy, Wacky, Fun
",The cast works great. There are some extremely hilarious parts on this show...and there are some that are pretty stupid ones but within the world of this show...stupid works very well.,/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2020,muamba_eats_toast,7," Loved the first season
","The first season was one of you my favourite series in quite some time it was hilarious and brought something I hadn't seen before to the table. The second series just threw everything that worked so well in that series in the bin and on the whole wrecked it. Whilst there was the odd funny moment I certainly wasn't laughing out loud throughout like the first although the season finale I thought was very good. Season 3 was a bit up and down better than 2 but not quite as consistent as 1 that being said I did atleast enjoy every episode. Season 1 9/10
Season 2 4/10 season 3 7/10.",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2022,resonatorwolf,7," Sim amazing season
",The first seasons was amazing. The second was still very good. Not the usual kind of humor. Great acting. Interesting storyline. Loved it. But then came third season and it really tanked. The second half of the season is particularly boring. Finished for the sake of finishing it but that was it. A shame to close on such a low note. Was amazing at one point. Kudos for those two seasons! You should watch those for sure.,/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,crudolphsmith,9," Highly recommended
",Took a few episodes to grow on me but what that was a great series. I've written maybe less than 30 reviews on websites since the internet became widely available but I felt strongly enough to write these words today. Perfect for when you're just exhausted and want to zone out and laugh.,/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2017,swampsloth,9," When people hate it for opposite reasons
","Half the reviews hated it for being too SJW, and the other half hated it for being too insensitive and dudebro comedy. I don't know what timeline I'm in anymore, but this is a great show so far. My only complaint was the use of a joystick in a video game, but at this point, I'm pretty sure that was ironic. For all you radical centrists out there, it's just a funny show. Enjoy.",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2017,industrialwonk,10," Easy Rider
","Just watched the first episode and noticed that they made a visual reference to ""Easy Rider."" The three main characters were dressed up as Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda, and the main character was wearing a white suit; the same suit worn by Jack Nicholson. The reference to that movie was more than skin deep because Nicholson played the ""square"" to Hopper's and Fonda's cool characters. There were other references to the 60's including the Whisky a Go Go, where the Doors played. ",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2022,ampf7,10," Amazing!
","Funniest show you've never heard of. Laugh out loud scene after scene. Depressing it is only three seasons. I want more! Spin-offs, sequels, alternate realities please!",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2021,dogs-pat,10," Slapstick Recursive Time Travel Comedy
","Of all the genres, Slapstick Recursive Time Travel Comedy is my favorite. Josh Hutcherson is one of the best at clueless slapstick. The writers leave no laugh unturned. The comedy turns from raunch to logical conundrum on a dime. Future Man is so bingeworthy.",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2017,Harun_Karali,7," Better than Expected
","Let me be the first to admit that this is a clichÃ©, corny and even cheesy story and normally that would be enough to turn me off from a TV show. However Future Man has a lot of redeeming qualities, such as the pacing of the show. I didn't notice how time flew by watching this series. Josh Hutcherson works as a janitor in a CDC like facility, where apparently they are close to finding the cure to HIV. Which sounds too good to be true, and it is. As there ""cure"" leads to the end of the world. Pretty standard science fiction, right? that is, Until they add the video game element into the mix. Which made for some comedic scenes, cheesy but still funny. Hutcherson's performance is fine, but it's Derek Wilson(Wolf) and Eliza Coupe(Tiger) who steal the show. This isn't a high budget series, so keep your expectations at bay and you won't be disappointed.",/review/rw3858281/?ref_=tt_urv
