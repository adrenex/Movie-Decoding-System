15 August 2007,ChaCha44,10," How can you not love this show?
","What more can you ask for? It's funny, it's silly, it has characters that you love and musical numbers that really work. The simple storyline of two New Zealand musicians trying to make it in the Big Apple puts to shame other comedies that try so hard whereas Flight of the Conchords just seems so effortless. Murray their manager who is trying to treat the whole ""band"" experience"" as though they were much larger in scope than just the three of them with almost non existent gigs is hilarious. Their one fan, Mel, is a wide-eyed, curly haired, stalker who conveniently runs into the guys everywhere. Never has stalking been this much fun. Not since Da Ali G. show has an HBO comedy been this enjoyable. Long life to the Flight of the Conchords. A hit if I've ever seen one. I LOVE YOU BRET (Brit)!",/review/rw4561290/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2008,AhearnePaul,10," Good one Dave. Ohhh, you're a legend Dave.
","I guess the general rule is that in any 1st season of a comedy there are going to be highs and lows. However this could be the exception to the rule. It was brilliant from start to finish. Anyone lucky enough to listen to the Conchords radio series in the UK or to have seen their HBO one night stand slot will not be disappointed. The humor is subtle and at times could be likened to the UK version of the office with Rhys Darby in the David Brent role (band manager Murray). Bret and Jermain satisfy audiences with their witty repertoire of songs and inane banter, all while the world around them seems to make less and less sense. Superb. A must see.",/review/rw4561290/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2007,golightly13,10," Witty Genius in a World of Over the Top Comedy
","To me, this show is bliss. I watched both of the first two episodes aired and am already in love. The genius lies in the delivery. The seriousness of which Bret and Jermaine approach the situation adds a certain amount of wit to every comment made. Pay close attention and the slightest musical references are made, such as Fleetwood Mac's ""love square"". It is the subtlety of the comedy that makes this show stand out above the rest.",/review/rw4561290/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2008,h2o_ns,10," Simply Brilliant.
","Words truly can't express the way I feel about Flight of the Conchords. My younger brother showed me a clip of their song ""Business Time"" performed live and ever since I've been hooked. The show itself is truly hilarious, but what really makes it a true 10/10 is the music. With songs like Business Time, Robots, Beautiful Girl, Bowie, Leggy Blonde and many more this show will make you cry tears of joy. Not only are the duo of the band brilliant but they also have comedians Rhys Darby as their hilariously pathetic band manager Murray and Arj Barker as their friend and local pawn shop guy to teach them how things work in America.",/review/rw4561290/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2007,Lasse Andersen,10," This show truly put Entourage to shame.
","Sunday night has been and still is HBO's night to shine, with great drama presented by the made in America Sopranos and its mafia tale(now its the surfer noir John From Cincinatti) and humor presented by Entourage. The Sopranos ended with a blackout and confusion and the fun that once was in Entourage is missing in its fourth season.",/review/rw4561290/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2007,pricegd2,10," The greatest comedy duo on HBO right now
","This show has all the elements of a great comedy. The supporting cast is consistently hilarious; just view episode 10 and listen to Murray's commentary on rock and roll and threesomes. Mel is another gem of a character who has a husband but lives and breaths the FOTC band. Arj always has some sort of admonition and advice for these unsuspecting guys and it makes for a hilarious misconstrued view. I love how the writers take an idea and spin it in the other direction, such as the episode where the woman objectifies the man. I consistently laugh at what wild and crazy situation these guys will get into next. I hope they continue this show another season! oneG",/review/rw4561290/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2008,blindredemption,9," Not for Everyone
",But it certainly is for me. Flight of the Conchords is all about the quick & subtle comedy & hardly gets in your face (aside from the musical interludes of extreme greatness).,/review/rw4561290/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2009,dunmore_ego,8," Ripping Musical Yarns from slightly to the right of Down Unda.
","FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS is Tenacious D without the raunch - but just as much a spank in the groin. That is, it will leave you breathless from laughing so hard (and you may have cracked a nut).",/review/rw4561290/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2008,carn72386,8," excellent musicians, funny show with potential, worth checking out.
","These guys really impressed me. They are excellent song writers, styling themselves after David Bowie, REM, and various genres they explored, and succeed in writing a legitimate, structured songs. They have a knack for creating a catchy song, and make it silly without compensating their shtick, or going overboard. They really take themselves seriously as musicians. And thats only 1/3 of reasons to check this show out.",/review/rw4561290/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2007,dustandghosts,9," Good! Very Nice!
","Smart writing! Not for the commercial masses. Well written and acted out characters. Original music throughout the program which is creative and innovative. Throughout the show the main actors perform out songs related to the episode that brings an unique style of directing. I really enjoyed Flight of the Conchords and looking forward to Season 2. The Band Meeting scenes are one the things that I enjoy about the show. Like I said though, not for the masses but a show that is very overlooked and very much not appreciated. A different brand of comedy and a very original series. Looking forward to buying the DVD of Season 1. Going in the collection!",/review/rw4561290/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2015,marieinkpen,10," Absolutely Perfect
","I think this is the funniest sit-com I have ever watched. It makes me laugh out loud more than anything else I have ever seen. Why is a rambling conversation about buying a cup, or Simon and Garfunkel tribute acts, so funny? The writing is perfect and the acting is perfect. I do not know how these guys keep a straight face - not just Jemaine, Bret, and Murray, but the understated support cast too. The idea of a musical sit-com sounds horrendous - but not only are the songs very very funny but they are actually good songs too. Production quality very high. Consistently ingenious, pure joy. It also makes me want to go to New Zealand.",/review/rw4561290/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2007,smitty_cregger52,8," Not Serious, Not Controversial, but Really Funny!
","This show stars two characters Bret, and Jermaine who have traveled from New Zealand to New York City in order to make their band ""Flight of the Conchords"" the next big thing. They are managed by a fellow New Zealander Murray, who really works for the NZ consulate in the US, but runs the band on the side, constantly failing to get them ""gigs"". Through interactions with Americans who almost always confuse them with Brits, an obsessed fan who is constantly stalking them, a buddy with a paintball gun, and a girlfriend who likes guys who are in a band, this show has some seriously funny moments. This show is full of humor that might make you think a little bit, but at the same time, you're hit with an occasional comment that makes you laugh, not laugh out loud, but you're just like haha, that was pretty funny. If you're a fan of Laugh out loud comedy where the jokes don't make you think a little bit, then stay away. This show isn't complex by any means, but it attempts to give you a subtle humor that some run away from. This show isn't the greatest thing to ever hit television, but if you're looking for a solid 30 minutes of entertainment, then tune in. I give it a very above average 8 out of 10, because it never fails to make you laugh, but at the same time, it's not the greatest show ever made.",/review/rw4561290/?ref_=tt_urv

17 December 2007,paul2001sw-1,9," This is Flight of the Conchords
","'Flight of the Conchords' tells the story of a couple of musicians from New Zealand trying to make it in a band in New York. They're not very good, they have no girlfriends, one fan and an incompetent manager (Rhys Darby, who steals most of the scenes he's in), and everybody just loves their English accents. The series' twelve episodes follow their failures. So what's so great? Partly its the absolutely deadpan way in which the undynamic duo's misadventures are depicted; but mainly its the songs, which are brilliantly bad, pastiches of real musical styles but hilariously funny (although the songs feature mainly in ""music videos"" or in scenes which blend the characters' imaginations with real life; on the rare occasions the band actually gets a gig, their act consists of an anaemic chant of ""we like to rock the party"" over a badly strummed guitar - there is a reason for the band's lack of success!). In some ways, this is 'Spinal Tap', but with more musical variety; and the funniest program of the year.",/review/rw4561290/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2015,deloudelouvain,10," Magnificent!
","Why oh why did they stop after two seasons? This show is absolutely fabulous. Normally I hate about every movie or series where they start to sing in but this show is the exception. The musicians are brilliant, the variety of genres, the lyrics are so funny you can't get enough of it. I started singing their songs after every episode. And then that same kind of repetitive humor through the whole show. I thought it was one of the funniest show I saw the last years. Jemaine and Bret are hilarious, Murray their manager that comes up with the stupidest ideas, and Mel their number one fan and also only fan... It's all a cocktail for a brilliant show. Too sad that this show ended. A proof that New-Zealand can deliver when it's about comedy...",/review/rw4561290/?ref_=tt_urv

22 October 2007,harryandsally,10," i miss it
","the subtle humor of this show is just so great. i also love the music. yes, our innermost thoughts are expressed in song, like when Jermaine writes a song for Brett and gets all graphic about his love for him and then Brett says he went a little over the top and Jermaine says ""that wasn't in there."" Also the dream Brett has where Jermaine is David Bowie. and how Murray always has to take roll at each meeting, including calling his own name. ""Murray? Present."" I think the key to the humor also is that they are so naive to the world of the US and they are learning every day. Oh, and when Jermaine tries to cheer Brett up by doing the talking stove. ""You love the talking stove, Britt!"" Hilarious. I thought I had a pretty strange sense of humor, but now I am sure of it! I actually didn't catch the show when it was on but I watched all the episodes on demand and now I am in withdrawal! Come back guys!",/review/rw4561290/?ref_=tt_urv

","Flight of the Conchords presents the experiences of Bret and Jemaine, a duo from New Zealand who're struggling to gain popularity as a folk band while residing illegally in New York. In this endeavour, they are aided by their manager Murray Hewitt, pestered by their only fan Mel, and advised by their friend Dave. The show combines deadpan humour with musical numbers as it depicts the protagonists' efforts to make ends meet, succeed at their musical ambitions and triumph in their romantic trysts.",/review/rw4561290/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2021,owen-watts,7," Inner City Pressure
","The Conchords series was a huge phenomenon that I entirely missed when it was originally on TV - their sound attracted earnest hipsters and it wasn't at all my bag - over the years though I've softened to them and now the astronomic hype has died down the understated alternate reality of the series seems to work even better through that retro lens. A world where these two charming and benign Kiwis aren't particularly liked by anyone and live in squalor in New York, drifting through strange sad narratives and roping their idiosyncratic songs into the mix in surreal asides. It all feels very low key and they play themselves with a heavy deadpan that puts the majority of the comedic weight on the manic Kirsten Schaal and the arrestingly silly Rhys Darby.",/review/rw4561290/?ref_=tt_urv
