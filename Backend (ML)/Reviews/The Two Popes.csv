15 March 2018,pensacolacomputer,10," This movie is more important than you think
","I had to see this movie. It reminded me of...me. I had a lot of great friends in high school. I had girlfriends. But I had one huge ass secret. I was gay. I didn't have the strength to come out in high school, but God did I want to. I graduated in 93' so things are much different now, but still very scary to come out I'm sure. I am out now and my life has been different ever since. Better ever since. I did not lose a single friend when I came out. I gained a new family of friends. I encourage anyone younger, or older, that is not out to do so. BUT, only when you are ready. You'll know when the time is right. ",/review/rw4160124/?ref_=tt_urv

","I knew nothing about this movie before I watched it. My wife heard it was great, gave me a brief synopsis of what it was about, so I said sure why not. I planned on catching up on some work emails while it was on in the background.",/review/rw4160124/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2018,pokedom,6," Cute, but that's about it.
","Part of me really wants to scream from the rooftops that the world is right in loving this movie. But I'm holding that back to talk about how the film is, as a film. It's not worth giving every movie with a positive message and cute moments a 10/10. Film doesn't work like that. By this logic Geostorm is a godsend of a movie. And we all know how that went.",/review/rw4160124/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,rivertam26,10," Truly one of the best films of it's kind
","At this point I've seen this movie about 12 times and it's just amazing. Being a gay man myself I never thought I'd see a mainstream release like this in my lifetime. I remember the first couple times I saw this the film audience went bonkers clapping and I was just in tears. Yes I'm kind of a wuss but this story feels so personal to me and to see a realistic, positive representation still blows me away. Especially since the film was a modest hit and more films haven't been made. The movie centers on a young man named Simon played by an impressive Nick Robertson who's outed by a jerk off classmate and has to deal with the repacutions including the fellow student he's mysteriously been messaging with. It ranks up there with the best of John Hughes. Its genuine, heartfelt and engaging. Truly one of the best films of its kind ever made.",/review/rw4160124/?ref_=tt_urv

","A gay coming-out movie that is laugh-out-loud funny with a charm factor that goes all the way up to eleven, a star-making performance from its young lead and a great song score; yes, it can only be ""Love, Simon"", the feelgood movie of the current season and a delight for all but the most virulent of homophobes.",/review/rw4160124/?ref_=tt_urv

2 September 2018,kevin c,8," Loved Simon
","Love, Simon could be dismissed as frothy stuff. But why has it taken us until 2018 to get a high school love story for a gay teen?",/review/rw4160124/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2018,2001ASOfan,7," Loved...the second half of the film
","Wow...this was such a mixed experience for me. I frankly hated (no joke) roughly the first third to half of ""Love, Simon,"" but, when more depth and consequences of actions are portrayed in the second half of the film I became engaged and loved it, up to and including the ending, which is as sweet and touching a conclusion as you hope for in a rom-com. I realize this is meant to be an homage to 80's teen films, so I tried to forgive the too-pat, flat, one-dimensional stereotypical characters frenetically surrounding the more grounded Simon (and there are far too many of them for you to have time to remember or care about), but the snarky, too-cool, and ""clever"" dialogue really got to me, and the film lost me for that first period. But then the consequences of Simon's selfish and, well, ultimately cruel actions toward his loving friends and family kicked in, and the resulting scenes swept me up and delivered me nicely to that sweet ending. I would likely watch this again, but with the awareness that I'd be enduring the first half (the equivalent of fingernails screeching on a blackboard) because it builds to a very satisfying second-half and conclusion. Worth viewing, but not the film I'd hoped it would be when I saw the clever and fun trailers for months prior to opening.",/review/rw4160124/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2018,michaeledward1212,5," Made For Straights
","Love, Simon is Hollywood's first attempt at a wide release gay film, and going into the film I was expecting something along the lines of a gay romcom, instead I got a watered down and unrealistic portrayal of coming out and the gay experience in general, which left me wondering how many LGBT people were behind the camera, and frankly in front of it. The movie has been called a modern John Hughes-esque film, but it completely lacks the sense of humor and depth to be compared to the likes of great 80s teen movies. ",/review/rw4160124/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2018,CitizenKaneAAAAA,6," Fulfil the purpose
","Important, relatable, anti-stereotype and all, but also cheesy, corny, and too bubbly. but you really can't make a film in this form to avoid those things, so this film is really for audiences who would enjoy this life-assuring kind of film. with that being said, i still have teary eyed at some scenes because i can relate to it to some extent but also combined with some cringeness attack because of the dialogue and all. could it better? i think it could, but that would kill the purpose of the film, so i'm glad that the film was made this way, but it's still not my thing.",/review/rw4160124/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2018,JonathanWalford,3," Disneyfied 90s Romcom of a serious issue...
","This film doesn't work because it is trying to be too many things, and doesn't do any of them particularly well. It actually looks like the director read the book, and then pulled ten movies to borrow ideas from to turn the book into a film. It's part Disney flick, complete with super happy shiny teens (who all look like they are in their mid 20s), fast quipping teachers, and hot-looking parents stuck in a comedy where everything can be resolved with a hug. It's part 80s/90s John Hughes style comedy, complete with over-acted goofy characters including a nerdy vice-principal and a sassy black theatre teacher, and it's even part High School Musical, with a lame rainbow dance sequence half-way through the film where the star proves he has no Terpsichore talents. The writing relies upon the most basic of misdirections used in the lesser works by mystery writers, where the most obvious murderer is the first one given an alibi.",/review/rw4160124/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2018,adam-may-bower,6," Over-Hyped
","'Love, Simon' may be an enjoyable coming-of-age film, but it misses the mark of being a great film due to the fact that it is too simple and uninspired. The characters felt cheaply written, with no real depth, and the protagonist was not as likable as one should be in this genre. The plot itself was rather predictable and had one of the most unrealistic endings that came off as ridiculous. The movies attempt to normalise the gay community and portray them as no different to the straight community, yet undermines itself by constantly stereotyping the LGBTQI community, again and again, ultimately contradicting the key message trying to be shown. I also find it rather misleading to portray a coming out narrative as so blas√© and nonchalant, when for many individuals, this is certainly not the case. However, all of this is not too say this is a bad film. Many critics and people have expressed all the great things about this film, so I decided to focus more on the negatives. But, there are certainly good things worthy of mention. It has a great cast, with Nick Robinson, Alexandra Shipp and Jennifer Garner being the highlights in the film. The humor in it is fine, with many laugh-out-loud moments but not many of them are memorable (excluding a hilarious and cringe-worthy reference to Grindr). This film certainly attempts to appeal to the millennial generation, with it's many references to pop-culture such as Hamilton, Buzzfeed and Trump references; and it certainly succeeds to a certain extent; the audience will be able to relate to the society it reflects. However, the film ultimately lacks to create a relatable narrative; but rather an unrealistic and misleading one.",/review/rw4160124/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2018,db53tg66,10," I didn't want to go.
","I was afraid this would be so sticky sweet I'd end up in a sugar coma. I was pleased to be completely wrong. I identified with Simon (even though I finished high school in '84). The fear of losing your family and friends makes the secret you carry that much more of a burden. This movie helps us all find peace in ourselves and teach us to celebrate our unique traits. Put this down as a feel good classic that will endure. 
I'm happy I went.",/review/rw4160124/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2020,PennyReviews,7," Good Enough
","Love Simon was a feel good movie. Loved the pop refrences and how the main character matured through his experience. The movie was overall nicely paced, with sweet friendship dynamics and an interesting main character that didn't overdo it and kept things real. So, for a teenage movie, this one was probably one of the best they have produced the last couple of years.",/review/rw4160124/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2019,jtindahouse,8," Wonderful characters drive a strong story
","The biggest strength that 'Love, Simon' possesses is its characters. So much care and effort has gone into each and every one of them. There are no throwaway characters simply put there to advance the plot. Each serves a purpose, yet each also contains a soul. It makes for wonderful viewing. Every scene is filled with so much depth and purity because of it. Films like this are a pleasure to watch.",/review/rw4160124/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2021,spongeval,3," Not so great, and even worse if you have read the book
","Tldr: The film is mediocre, and if you read the book (which is great), you will notice it even more. Simon and the rest of the characters are very well written in the book, and there's no room for tropes like the ""Easily Forgiven"" or ""Karma Houdini"" ones, unlike in the film.",/review/rw4160124/?ref_=tt_urv

",Bad gay coming of age movie. Simon (Nick Robinson) is 17 and secretly gay. He wants to come out but is afraid. Then someone finds out and threatens to out him. What to do?,/review/rw4160124/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2018,jon.h.ochiai,10," I love ""Love, Simon""
","The beauty and poignancy of ""Love, Simon"" is that what makes it so revolutionary may no longer be someday. Nick Robinson is vulnerable and authentic as 17 year-old Simon, who comes out as gay. In Director Greg Berlanti's ""Love, Simon"" someone hostages Simon's choice. He screams in anger, ""It's supposed to be my thing!"" Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker of ""This is Us"" wrote the eloquently whimsical screenplay based on Becky Albertalli's ""Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda"". Perhaps, Berger and Aptaker's story falters a little in contrivance seemingly forcing Simon's ""outing"". Yet, Berlanti and Robinson convey its touching humanity.",/review/rw4160124/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2021,breadandhammers,," While I appreciate it, this was frustrating to watch
","I appreciated this film for being a story about a gay character coming out to his friends and family. However, on a personal, subjective level, I didn't really connect with this story. Simon lives an amazingly comfortable and privileged life - he's White, handsome, well-off in a nice home, and though he is gay, masculine. It's never quite clear what the real stakes are for Simon to come out. His friends and family are obviously liberal and will love and support him. I just didn't feel like there was much at stake here. Additionally, everything about the marketing bills this film as a ""rom-com"", but it's actually very little rom, and almost no com. It's not very romantic (Simon only ends up with his love at the very end) and it's not very funny (save for some gag characters, like the teachers). Halfway through, the film even bogs down and sucks all the lightness it had at the beginning out to become an ""indie""-ish, ""serious"", ""coming-of-age"" kind of story about coming out. Finally, I didn't find the cinematography at all inspiring. It was extremely flat - wide shot, medium shot, wide shot, medium shot. I was shocked that in the scene where Martin is intimidating Simon that the shot was an up angle on Simon and a low angle on Martin. Why?! Why would you make the main character, who is being intimidated, look big and the bully look small? All in all, while I love the message and intent of the film, watching this film was a frustrating experience.",/review/rw4160124/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is going to drive the fundamentalists crazy. Imagine a film where the central
character is a gay teen coming to grips with his sexuality and his parents don't
immediately rush him into conversion therapy. Nevertheless a kid like Nick Robinson still has a lot to deal with, who doesn't at that age. Fortunately he's got
good friends and resources.",/review/rw4160124/?ref_=tt_urv
