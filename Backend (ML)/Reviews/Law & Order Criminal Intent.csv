1 November 2018,lisadewaal-98104,10," My cup of tea
","This show is either your cup of tea, or it is not. The expression 'your cup of tea' here has nothing to do with hot beverages, but is rather used as a metaphor. Tea comes in countless flavours, which is perfectly normal considering that there are countless types of people. And if you don't like a certain flavour, you don't like it.",/review/rw3622080/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2017,lars_,8," I'm glad I ignored Lemony Snicket's warnings
","In this 'golden age of television', the higher quality shows are usually the darker, more thought provoking series (such as Breaking Bad, Mr Robot and Westworld). However, in the case of A Series Of Unfortunate Events, this deep, dark tone is tweaked to create a more light-hearted show that does not come at the expense of the quality. The series lies in between 'adult' and 'kids' TV genres, creating a strange, funny show for the whole family. Don't let the forgettable 2004 movie scare you off, because the series gets right what the movie got wrong. From what I have seen of the series so far, there is a colorful, but dark sense of humour, some great acting, and well crafted dialogue that make the series worthy of a watch. The longer TV episode format allows for a more complete story, with one book spanning two episodes (instead of the movie cramming in three books). It is a lot more nuanced than the movie for this reason, with extra scenes and dialogue filling in the backstory and adding depth to the characters. Yes the show is absurd; yes sometimes there are things that might make you question why you are watching it. It is definitely for a certain audience, but at the end of the day this series of unfortunate events is not so unfortunate after all.",/review/rw3622080/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2017,Jaymuller,9," Dreadfully Entertaining
","The dreadfully entertaining story of the fate of Violet and Klaus Baudelaire after suffering the tragic loss of their parents and home to a mysterious fire. The riveting repartee (salted with subtle ironies, peppered with alliteration, and seasoned with astute observations) felicitous music score, and brilliant scenery is outdone only by the carefully crafted storytelling and performances that really cook! Patrick Warburton, as Lemony Snicket, is dolefully monotonic yet drearily expressive. Neil Patrick Harris, as Count Olaf, gives a talented portrayal of a talentless actor of dubious motivation. Malina Weissman and Louis Hynes, as Violet and Klaus, deserve honorable mention. All in all, a thoroughly well done show. However, if you are chagrined by dire circumstances, dismayed by unfair situations, or saddened by unhappy endings, perhaps you should take to heart Lemony Snicket's introductory caveat. Caveat means warning.",/review/rw3622080/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2017,mistoppi,9," The adaptation we deserve
","This show is everything the original movie should've been. The original movie is not bad, but the thing is, it doesn't have exactly the charm the books had. Reading the books after seeing the movie was like sun shining through the clouds after a while, because the writing in the books is so charming and clever and while it's all ""this is a tragic tale"" it's also not at all serious. The movie was like a weird shadow of that. Still great, still so very very unique, but something was definitely missing.",/review/rw3622080/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2018,lookattheowls,10," Absolutely amazing
","Let me start by saying I grew up with the book series, so I was prepared to (at least partially) dislike the tv series under the notion that ""The book is always better"". Well, I was delightfully surprised by the quality of the show: first of all, the casting is excellent --something that rarely happens with book adaptations. The black humor of the books is also flawlessly conveyed and even enhanced, I cannot recommend this show enough! It is very well-paced, beautifully shot and perfectly adapted for the now adult fans of the books to enjoy the story once again. The second season is even better than the first, which was also a great success. It deservess a 10/10 rating, I'd rate it even higher if I could!",/review/rw3622080/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2020,TheLittleSongbird,7," Deliciously dark events
","Loved the books when younger, am still fond of them now with only 'The End' not doing much for me ('The Slippery Slope' isn't a favourite either). The books do get criticised for being formulaic, or repetitive (though actually it did become less so from 'The Vile Village' onwards), and for the adult characters' stupidity, but just love the language and the juicy character of Count Olaf. Also think the 2004 film is a lot of fun and very well made and Jim Carrey's performance has fared better since first watching it.",/review/rw3622080/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2017,shobanchittuprolu,8," A Series of Unfortunate Events is an engaging Gothic adaptation of popular book with stellar cast and direction.
",A Series of Unfortunate Events (2017): Mostly any literary or dramatic works wants to end with a happy ending such that it enlightens audience feel but few writers believes in unhappy ending which enlightens audience perspective.A Series of Unfortunate Events is such unfortunate book in all perspectives but its not at all a tragedy.I loved the film adaptation of the book and Jim Carrey is the best Count Olaf.When I heard that Neil Patrick Harris is doing the role of Count Olaf in this TV Series adaptation I doubted him.I know that he is a good actor but Count Olaf is not at all his league.But surprisingly Neil Patrick Harris didn't disappoint and instead gave another memorable Count Olaf.Beside that there are lot of surprises in this TV adaptation.,/review/rw3622080/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2017,DarkLights95,9," This show is a blast
","Just finished marathoning through all 8 episodes today, and that was super fun! Neil Patrick Harris was obviously the highlight of the show, as well as Mr Poe, the narrator, Sunny, oh hell pretty much every character here was portrayed well! ",/review/rw3622080/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2017,KOOLAIDBRO,9," Just watch it
","Just finished episode one and man is it good. The actors and actresses are on point. Neil Patrick Harris is great as always. If anyone had ever told me Patrick Warburton narrating something was a good idea I would have told them they were crazy, but I would have been dead wrong. He is amazing for this series. Forgive me for not knowing the children's names, but I would be willing to bet that will soon change. They both steal scenes and will probably end up doing a lot of things. The scenery is dark and gloomy like a Tim Burton film. I have never never read the books or watched the movie so I have nothing to compare with. I'm hoping as the series continues it only gets better. So for now I give it a 9 which I do not hand out freely, so that's saying something. Strong opening. Watch it.",/review/rw3622080/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2017,TeamRocket_Jessie,10," Pensive Film Noir
","The series is exactly like the books but with added backstories, Easter eggs, and a film noir look. My favorite character is Lemony Snicket and his deadpan, droll, dreary, sarcastic narrative style that is the hallmark of the books is front-and-center in the show (often delivered by him; sometimes his book lines are given to other characters in the show). The lines in the show are often verbatim and other times they are updated to be more progressive (ex. challenging gender norms) for this day-and-age. It is peppered with bizarre show tunes that are similar to the ones you hear in the audio books.",/review/rw3622080/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2017,badmanlykme,10," Good start to a bad beginning
","This show started off promising and then each episode got consistently better introducing new and kwerky characters, I personally enjoyed the 2004 adaptation and this has some sprinkles of that in this series with also whole heap of new things to be explored and as a first season it has delivered i would have liked a darker tone to be cast similar to the movie but its still enjoyable for the most part and the child performances really surprised me and I appricated there presence, Its definitely not for everyone but give a try and you might find yourself having a lot of fun with this series.

31 March 2018,toxicpilgrim,5," A Series of Indulgent Performances
","I want to enjoy this show... what it's reaching for I find appealing, but I get frustrated watching it. I feel like I know the outcome of every scene, and the punchline of every joke... but the show needlessly stretches out every moment. I think the extended timing is supposed to be part of the humor and tone, but it lacks surprises and tension. I'm sure the cast and crew had a good time making this show, as there's lots of creativity in the sets and costume, but watching it is like reading a run-on sentence where the lack of punctuation is the joke.",/review/rw3622080/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2017,aleyro-89845,10," I was careful not to include spoilers (but beware just in case - some people are more sensitive than others)
","I admit that I haven't read the books (although now I want to), but after binge-watching the series and decided to watch the 2004 movie to compare with it (and I never thought I'd say this but - Jim Carrey falls flat next to NPH's performance!) - and now I feel I am entitled to have a legit opinion! Some reviewers have written that NPH is just revisiting his role as Barney Stinson all over again. That may or may not be true (I'm not going to argue that point), but if that's true - I believe that it was probably because of his role as Barney Stinson that he was chosen to play Count Olaf in the first place, so to revisit some of Barney's personality traits make total sense! I took the liberty to read a little about Count Olaf's character description (based on the books) and it seems like he's spot on! Watching the series I kind of get a ""Harry Potteresque""-feeling, which I personally like. It's partly dark (given the environment, the plot and the backstory), and yet it's surprisingly light as well, which I personally think is a perfect combination. I don't think I would've enjoyed this series so much without its light touches every now and then. It would quickly get too depressing to watch. I love the costumes and I found myself laughing at the most silly things - silly things that would not have worked if they were portrayed differently. The movie for instance, lacked so much information that it came across as rushed and abruptly interrupted (maybe that's the problem, and not Jim Carrey's performance). The series however, made a lot more sense to me. I preferred Monty in the series for instance, as I feel that I got to know him better there. I was actually sad to see him die in the series - in the movie - not so much. Series's Josephine was hilarious! I love Meryl Streep, but same thing happened here, her part in the movie was so quickly over that I didn't get to know her well enough to care about her either. I am not complaining over their performance's, just explaining why I think this story works better as a series than a movie.",/review/rw3622080/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2018,gcerda88,6," I really want to like this show, but its repetitiveness is a bit too much
","I want to like this show. I really do. And I know you want to have this show close to the books, but my god if I have to see another episode where no one can tell who the bloody hell Count Olaf is I am seriously going to have a stroke. This show is not for people with high anxiety and just can't deal with shows playing off on your disbelief. Each episode is basically the same. The kids are great, but I can't keep watching the show like this. I just can't take it.",/review/rw3622080/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2017,oslun,9," The unfortunate story of the Baudelaire orphans seems to have finally gotten a worthy adaptation.
","The show stands on it's own, a wonderful silly and atmospheric piece of work. It has well written jokes and a good story line. It will take you on an incredible adventure as we get to follow the Baudelaire orphans and their beloved count Olaf. It has a bit of dark but yet silly humor, and all the actors give an outstanding performance! There were very few flaws and one thing that did bother was from time to time the jokes were a bit dry. But most of the time it was an absolutely wonderful and hysterical adventure! I can proudly recommend this Netflix original to anyone who wants a bit a of a different story or just wants to watch a great show with laughter and excitement through out! To all those who were a fan of the books I can say that you will enjoy each and every episode! 9/10",/review/rw3622080/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2017,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,9," ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" (2017)- Definitely don't look away...
","Since 1999, the delightful children's book series ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" has captivated audiences young and old alike. Selling millions of copies and winning a number of awards, the novels by ""Lemony Snicket"" (a pen-name for author Daniel Handler) have become something of a small pop-culture phenomenon. So it should be no surprise that adaptations of the work would begin to pop up in other mediums, including notably a 2004 feature-film adaptation that was met with general critical acclaim but received only a mixed reception from the fanbase of the original source material. Due to lower-than- expected box office returns, any sequels were shelved, and it would be a full thirteen years (perhaps ironically) until Netflix took a turn at the material with 2017's wonderful new adaptation, which it set to be told over three seasons.",/review/rw3622080/?ref_=tt_urv
