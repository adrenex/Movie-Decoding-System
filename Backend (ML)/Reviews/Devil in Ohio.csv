31 May 2003,bob the moo,," At best  Tired. At worst  bigoted and offensive
","Earl Montgomery is a cop wannabe who can't get past the academy into the force.  Hank Rafferty is a real cop who is emotionally on edge having seen the murder of his partner by a gang raiding a warehouse.  When the two get involved in a minor roadside traffic stop, Earl claims Hank beat him and gets him thrown off the force.  Hank takes up a job as a security guard and sets out to find the gang that killed his partner.  He finds them in a warehouse protected by Earl (also now a security guard) and the two reluctantly team up to go after the gang.  However when they steal the gang's merchandise they find themselves hunted by both the gang and the cops.",/review/rw5557154/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2005,CuriosityKilledShawn,7," What the problem is?
","I usually don't like Martin Lawrence and I find his anti-white humor to be quite offensive as well as his string of bad movies. But compared to his other movie of 2003 (that would be the shockingly awful Bad Boys II), National Security is a rather easy-going and light-hearted cop comedy flick with quite a few good laughs. A lot of them, surprisingly, coming from Lawrence himself.",/review/rw5557154/?ref_=tt_urv

12 December 2007,Cristi_Ciopron,6," Funny little comedy;Roberts should have got a bigger role
","I enjoyed this little comedy much more than I expected; my main reason for seeing it was Roberts. Anyway, the film works in an unpretentious way. It amused meme and the person that I was watching the comedy withas a film that found its tone and channel. It is very fastpaced, and quite likable. It's very physical, goodnatured and enjoyable; as a matter of fact, it is a humorous crime drama, a humorous cop film (about corrupt cops, etc.).",/review/rw5557154/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2006,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,2," I take offense
","It takes a lot to offend me. I'd like to think I've been fairly hardened through the nineteen years I've lived. I can laugh at politically incorrect stuff. I find South Park quite humorous and satirical, rather than offensive and disgusting. It takes a lot to offend me. But this movie did. Dennis Dugan, continuing on the stroll he began with Saving Silverman which contained the biggest, most concentrated amount of misogyny in a single area, brings us one of the most racist films of newer time. Only, it's not what you'd immediately think; it's not racist against black people. Nope, it's against white people instead. As if that makes it any better. Hate and fascism is bad, regardless of where it's directed, which group or person is targeted by and for it. As pointed out on the message boards for this film, every bad guy in this film is white, and Lawrence's character plays the race card every other second in this movie. Now, let me make it absolutely clear; I don't hate anyone. I don't believe in hate. I have equal respect for everyone. I would have been just as offended had this movie targeted black people instead of white(the film would also have been shot down far quicker and more broadly), or if Saving Silverman had been hateful towards men, for that matter. The plot is pitiful. There was a scene in a courthouse that downright sickened me. The crowd was cheering as a victim of false allegations was attacked verbally and sentenced to jail-time... as if they were watching a sports event. The acting is OK. The humor was offending; most of it is Lawrence victimizing himself and berating white people. Both Zahn and Lawrence have been funny... what happened? There's not much else. I barely watched this film, because whenever I looked at the screen and paid attention to what was said, I was hit with an offending remark or action and felt a strong inclination to turn away, to concentrate my attention elsewhere. One to avoid. I don't really recommend this film to anyone... except for perhaps black extremists. Even most black people will most likely find this movie embarrassing and painfully stupid. And Dugan: so much hate... so much anger... have you considered seeking professional help? It can't be healthy. 2/10",/review/rw5557154/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2004,Smells_Like_Cheese,2," I know this sounds weird, but I was offended as a white person
","All Martin Lawerence does is complain about white people in the film. Just giving them the back hand. I was honestly offended. We had to watch this in our communications class. Seeing how stereotypes are. The teacher said ""And we laugh at what some consider offensive"". Duh! I mean I've heard the white jokes before, don't get me wrong. Sometimes they're funny. Like Chris Tucker. He has fun with it. But he doesn't' go overboard with it. Martin Lawerence does on the other hand. The movie is OK. But I wouldn't watch it again. It is a total rip off of Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, and Rush Hour. Stay away if you loved those films.",/review/rw5557154/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2018,Tak005,3," OK but offensive for some
",The movie is basically your run of the mill Police comedies. Where the two main characters are inept but come good and get results ( except in this case they are security guards). It's light hearted and not a bad effort. What does let it down badly are the racist jokes about caucasians. The film probably would not have even been aired if the jokes were reversed and made about other races.,/review/rw5557154/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2005,jotix100,1," Stereotypes
","""National Security"" is the latest misguided vehicle for Martin Lawrence. It's a mystery to most viewers how can this talented comedian fall so low. Either the people behind him don't have any idea of what to put him in, or Mr. Lawrence doesn't have any sense of what turkey to do next. After ""The Black Knight"" we thought no one would employ him, but he keeps turning in these dopey attempts at comedy.",/review/rw5557154/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2020,UniqueParticle,10," I guess I'm among very few that loves this film
","I remember being 10 when the trailer came out and was so excited to see it, I've seen at least 70 or more times since. Denis Dugan made such a fun comedy with amazing characters/ scenes! I love the way Martin Lawerence acts throughout Steve Zahn is great too they have great banter together! Also the only bad thing is the racial madness but I don't mind makes the story better.",/review/rw5557154/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2005,christian123,3," Painfully Unfunny
","National Security is a terrible comedy and one of the worst movies of the year. Earl and Hank have only one thing in common: they're both L.A.P.D. rejects. Hank just got kicked out, and Earl can't even get accepted in. After confronting each other on opposite sides of the law during a traffic stop that escalates way out of control, these two luckless individuals end up in partnership as security guards. Despite being damned to the lowest line of the law enforcement, Earl and Hank uncover a smuggling operation led by Nash and a his thugs. The plot sounds alright and it does have potential to be funny. Funny it wasn't though as this is one of the worst comedies I have ever seen. The reason this film is so bad is because of Martin Lawrence. Besides for a few films, Martin Lawrence has a terrible film record. He continues to get cast since some people find him funny. While he may deliver a funny line here or there, he usually goes over the top. His racism is so annoying and getting tired and he pretty much kills this film from succeeding. Steve Zahn plays his Hank and his talents are wasted. Dennis Dugan directs and he has made some pretty good films in the past including Big Daddy and Happy Gilmore. He does a terrible job this time around and hopefully he can rebound with his next film. National Security is such a poorly written comedy and it seemed like the writers weren't trying at all to be funny. The movie has nothing new to offer just the same tried gags as usual. The story turns out to be pretty dumb as well and not funny. The films running time is a brief 88 minutes. Even though, it drags at a lot of scenes and seems a lot longer. In the end, this film is defiantly worth skipping as well as most of Martin Lawrence's movies. Rating 3/10 avoid this ""comedy"" at all costs.",/review/rw5557154/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2018,FountainPen,1," An unhappy police ""comedy"" with heavy racial problems
","The character played by Martin Lawrence looks like and acts like a total moron, but also a heavily racist moron, and a dangerous moron. Surely such ta person as he, whether black or white, would NEVER make it into a police force? 
I found this film extremely offensive and worlhless. It plays to the basest instincts, is not at all clever, apparently strives to hit every crude cliché around, while introducing hideous behaviour that will amuse only those with mindsets stuck at age 5 and IQs well below 70. 
The movie is a disaster, a shameful disaster, which should never have been made. A Spanish-language ""song"" is played a few minutes into the film: one of the Spanish words is ""pendejo"". (a very oscene word for penis) I was not surprised to hear this; it just about sums up the attitude and level of the producers of the flick. I hope that they will receive a little blast of enlightenment soon, and try to produce a movie that has some decent qualities while providing entertainment without resorting to filth and overt stupid racism ~ whether from blacks to white or from whites to blacks. Please!",/review/rw5557154/?ref_=tt_urv

29 July 2010,SilverCentri2009,1," They should have really kept race out of it

17 January 2010,pinetarrag,1," Racist drivel
","I like Martin Lawrence, I thought he was funny in ""Martin"", ""Blue Streak"" , and the Bad Boys films. In those films, however Lawrence plays a likable character. In National Security he plays a racist dolt. Lawrence is a security guard who tried and failed to be a LA cop. After a cop played by Steve Zahn mistakenly believes he is trying to steal a car, a bee flies by and Zahn tries to swat it away. It is misconstrued as an act of police brutality and Lawrence lies and gets Zahn thrown in jail.",/review/rw5557154/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2013,kairingler,7," great comedy
","Martin Lawrence was absolutely funny in this movie,, he had so many great one liners I couldn't stop laughing the entire movie,, yeah the buddy cop genre has pretty much worn out it's welcome in the last 20 years. but this one is refreshing. Steve Zahn who I never heard of was also funny at times.. the main story of the movie is that our main character arrests a man and turns out he wasn't even guilty,, together they are thrown together to go up against some bad guys , and have a lot of fun in doing so.. yes there are some aspects that are played out over and over again, but for the most part, there are some interesting thiings going on in the movie that I haven't seen that much of before,, I f you're looking for a comedy that will make you laugh all of the way thru the movie, then this is for you.",/review/rw5557154/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2003,johnrinck,," Pretty painful overall, but has it's moments
","This movie could have worked if Martin Lawrence wasn't so goofy and over the top.  He was just flat out annoying in this movie.  Maybe the writing was so poor that this is the only way for him to play the character, or maybe he had too much artistic license and the director was too sheepish to keep him in line.  Whatever the case, the movie isn't a total loss, but you know you have a bomb on your hands when your two year old likes this seemingly adult-oriented movie more than his father did.",/review/rw5557154/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2020,Calicodreamin,6," What the problem is?

23 February 2004,msanne,1," Lawrence takes wrong direction
","If you like movies packed with racial jokes, you're in for a hit. Or should I point out that the racism comes from Lawrence and goes on and on into stereotyping 'tha black bro'...? I'm 100% confused by what Lawrence tries to accomplish with this movie, besides doing a ninety minute round up about what he apparently would like everybody to believe to be 'the way that black people should act'. If all the displayed racism would come from his white opponent in this movie, I think it would have started a riot. It should be forbidden for anybody to produce these kind of racist-movies. Shame on you Lawrence.",/review/rw5557154/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2020,Aaron1375,6," I enjoyed this sort of different take on the buddy cop film.
","The film features two guys who are security guards teaming up to stop something foul, so it is sort of different I guess; however, the John Candy and Eugene Levy security guard duo movie is superior. I do like Steve Zahn and he makes this film a lot better than it has any right to be; yet, from a lot of posters and such, you would think he is a secondary character at best to Martin Lawrence who is front and center of all the promotional stuff for this film. Seems a bit unfair, considering the movie does actually center on Zahn's character more than Lawrence, who is funny in this, don't get me wrong, he just seems to be the second guy in this film.",/review/rw5557154/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2014,inkblot11,7," Brainless, silly fun, we all need it sometimes!
","Hank (Steve Zahn) is a dedicated police officer while Earl (Martin Lawrence) is a security guard who longs to join the force. One day, Hank pulls Earl over for a minor infraction but things get out of hand quickly. Earl is full of lip and Hank has a breaking point. But, there's more. A bee starts buzzing nearby and Earl screams that he is highly allergic. As Hank tries to swat the bee, a citizen films the encounter, which looks like he is beating Earl. Plus, Earl does get stung. Sensing a financial opportunity, Earl allows his swollen face to be photographed, too. Thus, the situation looks like the second coming of Rodney King and Hanks is fired. Poor guy, he is also send to prison for six months AND loses his gal in the process. When he gets out, the only thing open to him is a security guard position. In this capacity, he runs into Earl, again, on the job, where a beautiful lady is distracting Earl's attentions and a crime is going on in the background. Hank tries his best and Earl jumps into the game. From then on, although they don't catch the bad guys the first time around, this unlikely duo teams up to take down the criminals. Along the way, they fight, they laugh, they get into sticky situations. Will they become unlikely heroes? Hey, there's nothing wrong with watching two very funny men, Zahn and Lawrence, do their thing, along with a nice supporting cast. Chuckles come forth again and again. In addition, there is some great action scenes and stunts that will also please the right crowd. All right, the script is not Oscar stuff but no one really cares. To secure an evening of laughs, get National Security soon!",/review/rw5557154/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2014,SnoopyStyle,4," Stupid characters in bad buddy duo with ugly racist Martin Lawrence
","Hank Rafferty (Steve Zahn) and Charlie Reed (Timothy Busfield) are LAPD officers who responded to an alarm. Charlie is killed right in front of helpless Hank. He is forbidden to investigate the robbery. Earl Montgomery (Martin Lawrence) is a smart-mouthed recruit who gets kicked out. He locked himself out of his car and Hank confronts him. A bumble bee cause a media sensation of another police beating. Hank is fired and prosecuted. After time in the state pen, all Hank could get is lowly security guard job. When a similar break-in happens, Hank investigates and finds the same bad guys led by Nash (Eric Roberts). Earl works as the security guard in the building and the unlikely duo goes after the bad guys.",/review/rw5557154/?ref_=tt_urv

","Recently re-watching this early 2000's Action Buddy Cop Comedy, i noticed how over the top racist it is against whites from the blacks point of view, now i normally would just ignore it but oh my is Martin Lawrence over the top annoying as he's constantly against his white partner Steve Zhan, at first it was kind of silly & funny but then it was constant & harsh so much so that it ruined some fun moments!!!",/review/rw5557154/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2020,Kingslaay,7," Hilarious
","National Security was a funny and easy going film. Something where you don't need to think too hard but just sit back and enjoy. Martin and Steve excel as a comedic duo who solve a crime. Its definitely not an Oscar contender but I would say it serves one of the purposes of film which is some easy going fun. You don't need to fully focus on it to observe plot points.
