","These couples are gross to watch. The inmates and their lovers all belong in prison. There is no difference between any of them. These are the trashiest people I have ever seen on any television show, including the prison lock-up shows. The bottom of the barrel. Television has finally hit rock bottom.",/review/rw6981358/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2018,llakefield,1," Repeats
","Every time I've seen parts of the show, it seems like the same show over and over and over again. There is sooooo much repetition of scenes and dialogue. Seems A year's worth of it would last only 20 minutes if it weren't looped so much. Selling soap?",/review/rw6981358/?ref_=tt_urv

","Gee, nothing is sacred anymore. I mean, people are meeting up and are getting engaged to up ex convicts. Damn. I'm 21, and I can't even get a job. This show is annoying evertime I see it as preview when watching reruns of Law & Order: Criminal Intent, and the original Law & Order.",/review/rw6981358/?ref_=tt_urv

",It's enjoyable trash TV to watch when you want to laugh at the idiocy of humanity. Of course it's not great. That's the point. Enjoy the lunacy and relax.,/review/rw6981358/?ref_=tt_urv

","I never watch reality tv, in fact I cant stand it. I watched an episode of this simply out of a morbid curiosity. I was reeled right in! Its brilliant tv. Granted they constantly repeat the same bits but that's pretty much all American tv. Edge of your seat stuff 80% of the time none the less",/review/rw6981358/?ref_=tt_urv

10 February 2019,darrylhumblesdh,," Desperately seeking drama
","Its amazing to me watching this slow motion train wreck how many people HAVE to be in a relationship. One guy spent his entire savings on one women who is clearly interested in only his money. Brad Pitt he's not. Another Romeo who has two women, one of which has his kid and other on the way, and by the way, he ""de-flowered"" the other girl. Another desperate soul is involved with a woman who has a history of fraud and substance abuse. He marries her and on the wedding night she leaves him to score drugs and steals the rental thats in his name by the way. Kind of have an idea how these situations are going to end........and its not good.",/review/rw6981358/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of the best quality reality tv-show out there. Genuine people going through the hardships of life in a post-apocalyptic dystopia filled with trashy people, government officials and bratty kids. The lives of most of those people makes Dante's inferno feel like a trip to Disneyland.",/review/rw6981358/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2019,jill-kegler,10," A True Guilty Pleasure!
",I started watching this because I really couldn't believe this happens on a normal occasion. That criminals are allowed internet access and they can have dating profiles and I was not aware of all this. Personally I think the women signed safety and dating a man behind bars because they're in a relationship and who knows if the guy will ever get out. It is my guilty pleasure and I love watching it I don't think any of the relationships have lasted. But I never thought they would even from the very first episode. I don't care I still love the show,/review/rw6981358/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show rules! Seriously so much mindless and perfect for ""vegin"" out. Need an instant pick me up about your love life, or lack there of. Look no further, this show will provide an instant pick me up:
Or
Do you need an idea as to where you could find love, and how glamorous it would be...
this show is more self esteem boosting then hoarders, watch it!!!!

12 February 2019,cygnetboy,1," Mindless dreck for low-class idiots.
","First let me say that I've only seen the previews of this program, so I can't give a play by play of every episode. That being said, the very idea that the American people are in some way served by this rolling train wreck of a show is the reason we are in the shape we're in as a country. I wouldn't want to watch a bunch of criminals and their love lives. It can't be that much of an improvement to what they had in prison and I sure don't want to see that either. 400+ cable channels and this is the lowest common denominator without a doubt. Cheap to produce because they don't have to pay actors, writers, etc., and it shows. To the producers: Ger a real job, there's no Emmy award for you with this schlock! What's next? Snuff films? This is one half a degree above that.",/review/rw6981358/?ref_=tt_urv

22 June 2019,mariasanjuan,10," First off I love this show truly.A show thats finally not about the Uber rich
","People are so ridiculous on social media that I had to write a 2nd review We certainly cant blame our countries problems on a reality tv show thats just ridiculous Maybe people dont like what they see on the show but this is whats happening in millions of lives People are struggling in life I guess as long as people dont see it we can act like its not happening That must make it better for them But its not societys job or the producers job to uphold sheltered point of views I love how the makers of this show has swiftly lifted the skirt on life like a 2nd grade school boy The stuff on this show is happening people are broke or confused and lied to and manipulated and suffer for all sorts of reasons. Whether we see it or not Its happening I guess I should go over the point of reality tv is for people to watch other peoples lives and for brief moments in time take us away from our own lives and problems Nobody is saying reality tv is suppose to uphold some sort morality quota for the country Its raw entertainment We get to watch lives unfolding bad decision making and let downs as well as uplifting scenarios and goal meeting. Either way people love to see inside other peoples lives for whatever reason Im a professed reality tv junky through and through From conceited socialites to competitions to survival This show is just outside that box Which I love It shows everyday people and their true feelings It opens up a new era of tv just like when the real world came out people didnt get it They loved it or hated it Thought it was stupid or fantastic Either way it had opened up a new genre that people couldnt help but to watch This show is in that realm For years theres been a need for a show that shows real life struggles and pain and what everyday people get faced with Struggles outside of having to sit in coach while flying to Europe or missing a botox appointment because the maid forgot to let the dog out I think you get the point To the producers of the show I hope you make more spin offs and there's many more years to come LOCKUPLIFER

22 June 2019,mariasanjuan,10," Best show ever. It lifts the prison system curtain, for all to take a peek.
",We have so so so many shows on the Uber rich and their simplistic lives. Traveling the world and arguing over who said what during these worldly trips jus to ruin it for themselves. Most people cant even identify with that lifestyle. But a show like this with real life struggles and true confusion of not knowing what comes next is something everyday people can understand. I MEAN anybody of any age financial/social status can find themselves in this situation with a loved one. And let's be honest at the least most people has that one uncle or aunt or cousin thats in the system. If you enjoy the guilty pleasures of reality tv?Then this show will deliver you to all those wonderful shocking wow places thats so addicting. Almost all of my friends watch this show religiously. Any true reality lover loves this show.If you don't love the reality drama And shock then of course you won't like this. And will most likely have nothing good to say about it. So its best to jus not watch and leave the ratings to us LOCKUP LOVERS.,/review/rw6981358/?ref_=tt_urv
