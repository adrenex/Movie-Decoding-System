26 May 2006,cosmic_quest,9," A fun take on the Superman franchise
",'Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman' was one of the better sci-fi shows to come out of the Nineties and it was probably one of the first attempts to give the comic franchises a modern twist.,/review/rw0316437/?ref_=tt_urv

10 February 2005,claudio_carvalho,," Great and Charming Entertainment For Children and Adults
","Yesterday I watched a VHS released by ""Warner do Brasil"" with the pilot episode of this TV series. The story begins with Clark Kent (Dean Cain) arriving in Metropolis and being hired by Perry White (Lane Smith) to work in the Daily Planet with Lois Lane (Teri Hatcher) and Jimmy Olsen (Michael Landes). Meanwhile, Clark misses his parent Jonathan Kent (Eddie Jones) and Martha Kent (K Callan) and is harassed by his colleague Catherine ""Cat"" Grant (Tracy Scoggins). However, he has a crush on Lois Lane. Meanwhile, a spacecraft explodes and a scientist, considered mad by his community, advises that there was a sabotage on the launching. Along the story, it is disclosed but never proved that Lex Luthor (John Shea) was the responsible for the explosion. Clark becomes the Superman, and Lex Luthor his greatest enemy. I was not a regular viewer of this series on TV, but I liked most of the episodes that I have seen. This VHS is excellent, introducing the characters of ""Superman"" in a delightful story. The beauty of Teri Hatcher would be enough to support this movie, but the chemistry between the handsome Dean Cain and the gorgeous Teri Hatcher is also a wonderful attraction. ""Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"" is a great and charming entertainment for children and adults. My vote is seven.",/review/rw0316437/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2018,Kirpianuscus,," nice
","A nice serie, based on the chemistry between the lead actors. Not impressive but decent for the grace and art to propose another perspective. And for beautiful effort of Teri Hatcher and Dean Caine to propose a seductive story, in which love has the fundamental role. Short, a lovely serie.",/review/rw0316437/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2016,safenoe,8," A charming show that was one of the first to be driven by an internet fan base
","I have fond memories of Lois and Clark, and Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher displayed superb chemistry for a series that should have gone on longer than four seasons. I find it a miscarriage of TV justice when Saved by the Bell runs longer than fine shows like Lois and Clark.",/review/rw0316437/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2005,redryan64,," SUPERMAN + a series like MOONLIGHTING=LOIS & CLARK
","An adaptation of a feature character like SUPERMAN will have a great deal of variance, not only in the era that it is in, but also the audience (demographics) that is desired to r-r-r-r-reach. This was a point always taken into consideration by National Comics Publications( AKA DC Comics), the Copywright owner of Superman and his friends. Therefore in the 1950's, National/DC published comic magazines such as SUPERBOY and JIMMY OLSEN to appeal to the younger kids,especially boys.And alas, they did the girl's Superman magazine, LOIS LANE.All featured Superman, but with a little different spin or, point of view, if you will.",/review/rw0316437/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2008,Eightiesjunkie,10," Excellent Show!
","I've always been a huge Superman fan but never cared for the Superman films because: Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent is always a big goof, Margot Kidder sucked as Lois Lane, and Gene Hackman couldn't do Lex Luthor justice.",/review/rw0316437/?ref_=tt_urv

25 June 2013,PWNYCNY,10," Wonderful series.
","This series offers a warmly human interpretation of the relationship between Superman and Lois Lane. The series treats their relationship with warmth and and with a measure of plausibility. It must be remembered that Superman is not human, and that fact alone could have undermined any attempt to humanize the being from another planet. Yet, this series deals with that situation well, helped immeasurably by the wonderful cast, headed up by Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher, who work well together. Their performances alone make this series worth watching. In this series Superman is heroic but not emotionally distant and as Clark Kent is affable and respectable without being overly bumbling. Superman handles his disguise well and as George Reeves did in the original Superman television series, Dean Cain projects a aura of quiet strength and levelheadedness which makes the character even stronger. By the way, in this series Superman often consults his mother, which makes the character even more endearing.",/review/rw0316437/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2006,creole_femme,," Love it!
","This version of Superman has always excited me because Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain have such awesome chemistry with each other. Dean Cain makes expert display of Clark Kent's restraints and clumsiness and Superman's authority as a Metropolis savior and his playfulness as the keeper of Lois's affections. We can see his turmoil between being who he has to be and being who he wants to be...with lots of comedy in between. Hatcher, in my opinion, is by far the best Lois to date. She has strength and class and isn't afraid to take chances with her character. She'll sing, she'll dance, she'll turn on the baby-voice...and she gives Lois a persona so stubborn, only Superman can get her to see the truths about herself and the people around her. Add in Lane Smith, who's so ridiculously funny in his Elvis-ized Santa suit and you have pure comedy. Lane Smith is the wise man of the group, fostering Justin Whalen through his mishaps and growth as a photographer and a young man. Justin Whalen's Jimmy Olsen has a certain naivet√©' necessary to balance the complex personalities and tensions of Lois and Clark. Michael Landes, who played Season One's Jimmy Olsen, is equally as entertaining...making it difficult to choose who is more deserving of that role. If one invests in such a purchase, it would be hard to be disappointed.",/review/rw0316437/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2002,abotsakou,," A Greek point of view
","First of all, I 'm Greek, so excuse me if my English are not perfect. I read all of the comments here. The day I 'm sending this L&C's third re-run here in Greece is still continuing, but as I could see it's close to its end. Well, I have to say I 'm a BIG FAN, and I 'm glad to know there are also many fans of one of my favorite - ever TV series. I have to admit, though, L&C was not perfect. My opinion is that it was REALLY GOOD. It had a really good casting - Dean Cain (who is very handsome) is not that short, for God's sake! - and all of the actors fitted great into their roles. The script was also good, and I don't agree with the ones who said that after Lois and Clark's wedding it went bad. And of course I enjoyed the large amount of humor in it. About these flying - scenes... Well, the truth is they could be more and better. I have to say, I never was a Superman's fan, and I 've watched only one of Christopher Reeves movies. (And I liked it.) What is completely wrong for you to say (I don't mean to be rude), is that Dean Cain didn't try to make Clark Kent and Superman look different. OF COURSE HE DIDN'T!! Clark and Superman ARE the same person!! They can't be THAT different!! They have the same character, the same feelings, the same looks... because they ARE the same. They ARE one and only person. So, this is the right way for this role to be played. I agree also with this focusing in Clark's life. After all, HE is the main character. And the problems he has is what we want to see (and his struggles with the bad guys, of course), because, even if we know he doesn't really exist, we like to feel him close to our lives and feelings. If a Superman is what we need, and we can't have him in our true lives, let's just watch him! Last thing I have to say is that I would really like the idea to see Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher back as Clark Kent and Lois Lane again, to a new series or a movie. I hope I will. If I won't, though... I hope I see another Superman, because he's a really interesting idea. Congratulations to his ""inventors"".",/review/rw0316437/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2020,wkozak221,10," Fun series
","I still like this series. It was fun. The cast was well rounded. The storylines were interesting. Sometimes I prefer the early episodes. Tracy Scoggins was fun. Also, you had John Shea. Excellent Lex Luthor and great cigars. It was fun to see Terry Kiser in a repeating role.",/review/rw0316437/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2005,MEduardaEloy,," It's still magical
","This is my all time favorite TV show. I first started watching it as a child and even though I didn't get all the plots at the time, I was mesmerized by the superhero in the blue and red suit. As years passed and I watched the show again on reruns, the intensity of the romance between Lois and Clark became what captivated me the most. I believe that this is definitively the best caricature of what would an amorous relationship between Lois and Clark (and not Lois and Superman) be. The idea of Clark being a normal guy (with superpowers, yes, but still trying to pursue a seemingly normal life)and Superman being his cover is a good change. Another good thing is that the show's merit doesn't rely only on the main characters. The supporting characters of Perry White, Jimmy Olsen, Martha and Jonathan Kent, Lex Luthor and Cat Grant(this one unfortunately only during the first season) added many of the best moments in the show. Unfortunately, and I guess everyone realizes it, during the third season the show started having some really weird plots with no such thing as coherence. It was still fun but there was something lost along the way. Nevertheless, it's still the best TV show I've ever seen. The only that truly caught my eye from the very first moment. To this day I'm still a fan and it's still magical for me to sit in front of the TV screen and watch another episode of this great show. So, thank you very much Deborah Joy Levine and all the others that wrote all the episodes we watched, to Dean Cain, Teri Hatcher, Lane Smith, John Shea, Michael Landes and Justin Whalin, K Callan, Eddie Jones, Tracy Scoggins and all the other actors who performed such great roles, and at last but not least thanks to rest of the crew for making this Superman fly.",/review/rw0316437/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2004,screenhound22,," Wonderful promise, but the show couldn't live up to it
","As a loyal fan of L&C, I have to say that I loved most things about the show.  Teri Hatcher turned in my favorite portrayal of Lois Lane to date. Lane Smith's attitude as Perry White was usually enjoyable.  Most importantly, Eddie Jones and K Callan set a new standard as Jonathan and Martha Kent.  Originally billed as recurring characters, their efforts on screen were just too wonderful to be denied and became a staple of the show through its many ups and downs.",/review/rw0316437/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2017,blanbrn,8," Crime fighting with a nice sexy romance subplot!
","This TV series which ran back in the mid 90's sure was one good adaptation of ""Superman"" as the series kept true to form with the hero doing crime fighting and keeping the planet save. And on the side the series focused on the romance between Clark and Lois that developed from their time together at the daily planet. Dean Cain was in top form as Clark Kent and Superman as his slick hair and hunk looks was a great modern day image of Superman and a throwback to the good old days of ""Superman"" in the comics. And during the series the planet and world would always be saved, aside from that enter the girlfriend Lois Lane(played by the very hot and sexy Teri Hatcher)as in this series would show the romance she had with the ""Man of Steel"" and many scenes were so hot with Teri Hatcher. And I remember many episodes of Teri being a damsel in distress as her Lois character so many times was tied up and gagged or either had her mouth shut with duct tape! Never fear Superman was always to the rescue! Overall great Superman series and with a good spin subplot of romance and Teri Hatcher made it a sexy watch!",/review/rw0316437/?ref_=tt_urv

8 December 2000,Brian-272,," A different look at an American hero (Superman). A must watch due to one of the most beautiful women in the world Teri Hatcher.
","I only watched episodes from time to time when ""Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"" aired on The American Broadcasting Company. Now since Turner Network Television airs ""Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"" I watch more episodes. I must say that for one what a great TV-series it is combined with the beauty of Teri Hatcher it makes you feel ready for a great time. Dean Cain is your prototype Clark Kent/Superman with his looks and physique. The show became such a hit due to the great chemistry that existed between Cain and Hatcher. I must say what a beauty Hatcher is I tell you Teri Hatcher is the main reason I watch ""Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman""! And is Teri's Lois Lane character a damsel in distress or what? Every episode I watch Teri (Lois) is either tied up and gagged or has her mouth taped with duct tape. Teri's Lois Lane character happens to be the most tied- up and gagged character I have ever seen in one certain TV-series or perhaps in Hollywood history. Now you can call her a damsel in distress. What were the shows producers and directors thinking? Poor Teri. To much rope and to many knots for a beauty. But never fear this Superman is always to the rescue. So if you can catch the reruns on Turner Network Television you will not be disappointed.",/review/rw0316437/?ref_=tt_urv

16 November 2006,OrdinaryDay,9," I really miss this show - the chemistry between Cain and Hatcher was sensational!!!
","Lois and Clark was a fine attempt at bringing Superman to the small screen. Good story lines that were self contained so you did not have to see every single episode to follow the plot, and fantastic performances carried this show!!! Dean Cain was perfect in the role of Superman, and managed to perfectly contrast the nerdy Clark Kent with the courageous, brave Superman! The story lines were to die for - every week there would be some threat to Metropolis and only Superman could save the day. Lex Luther was perfectly cast, and even some of the shows weaker points, such as the budget special effects, did not mitigate the show severely. All in all, a great show and well worth watching.",/review/rw0316437/?ref_=tt_urv

","The greatest thing about this show is that the stories are not reduced to another super-hero story, it's a lot more. First of all, superman is not the principal character, the couple Lois and Clark are. Lois have never been so strong and confident. Teri Hatcher made a wonderful job. Dean is great too. Although it can be silly sometimes, we can have a lot of fun watching it, specially the old ones, when Lois didn't know the truth about Clark.",/review/rw0316437/?ref_=tt_urv
