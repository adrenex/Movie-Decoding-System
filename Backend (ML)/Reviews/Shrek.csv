21 June 2020,planktonrules,9," Groundbreaking.
","For younger viewers, they might not understand the impact of ""Shrek"" on the film industry and CGI movies. However, being an older guy, I remember how groundbreaking and amazing the computer animation was when the film debuted. It was head and shoulders better than the few CGI movies that had come out in the previous decade...and it finally gave Pixar a serious run for the money. In addition, the plot was very adult...and the film's appeal was much greater than a typical CGI story. Great animation, great story telling and great voice acting, while the movie isn't quite impressive to see today, it still holds up very well and is well worth your time.",/review/rw2346300/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2005,mjw2305,9," A Wonderful Achievement
","Shrek is a wonderful parody of every fairytale story that you can think of, for the kids it has charm, humour and tons of fun, and is a delightful film for them to enjoy. In addition, Shrek has plenty of subtle innuendo and more adult themes running seamlessly along side the story, much of which may pass younger children by, without spoiling any element of their enjoyment; while at the same time enhancing the enjoyment for the older viewers.",/review/rw2346300/?ref_=tt_urv

8 September 2002,smashattack,10," Brilliant humor!
","Shrek is completely new.  Never has a fully CGI movie taken on the twists, turns, and surprises as Shrek has.  It's a full parody of numerous fairytales, and its humor is, well, humor at its best.  Grown men will laugh at the jokes of Farquaad's Stature and the hidden meaning behind every little comment.  Of course Shrek, like all other movies, has its emotional moments (so what if I lied about it being completely new?).  And these moments aren't cheesy or anything.  They are kind of funny, but at the time of viewing you won't really feel like laughing.  You'll feel like the characters.",/review/rw2346300/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2019,rhirahan,10," A timeless masterpiece
","A movie suitable for children, but really made for an adult audience. It's funny, has many quotable catchphrases and teaches us so much. It shows us that love has no limits, that you can find love where you'd least expect it and that beauty doesn't show only on the outside. It is also a great story about unlikely characters forming friendships that will last a lifetime.",/review/rw2346300/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2014,SnoopyStyle,9," Super fun family movie
","Shrek (Mike Myers) is a green ogre happily living alone. Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) has rounded up all of the kingdom's magical creatures into Shrek's swamp. Shrek wants his isolation back. It doesn't help that he is now followed by the talkative Donkey (Eddie Murphy). Farquaad wants to have Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) so that he could be a proper king. So Farquaad strikes a deal with Shrek. If Shrek rescues Fiona, Farquaad will return Shrek his swamp.",/review/rw2346300/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2003,jaywolfenstien,," Wicked
","Shrek is one hell of an animated ride, and right when you're certain you know where to expect the next gag it one ups you. If you need a reason to see Shrek, here is that reason: imagine Eddie Murphy as an annoying not to mention obnoxious talking donkey. Yeah. Eddie Murphy gives Robin Williams a serious run for his money in terms of greatest animated side kick. From there we get Mike Myers voicing a big green ogre, who plays off Eddie Murphy with perfect comedic timing like the two were meant to do this film together. ",/review/rw2346300/?ref_=tt_urv

11 May 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," Original and funny: delightful for kids and adults alike!
","I liked the incidental music very much, especially in the escape from the Dragon scene. I wasn't hugely fond of the pop music featured, but putting that minor quibble aside, this was still an original and funny animated film, that will please any animation lover. The animation is faultless, never stiff, and lovely backgrounds. The script is laugh-out-loud funny with the fairytale characters, Gingerbread Man especially, and Robin Hood. The characters are definitely memorable, and the terrific voice cast brings the film to life. Mike Myers voices the ogre with feeling, but it is Eddie Murphy who steals the film. Though Cameron Diaz is lovely as Fiona, and John Lithgow is delightfully villainous as Lord Farquad, though his villain isn't the most memorable villain ever in an animation. The film sparkles with heart and humour, it is impossible not to like it. In conclusion, look out for it, you'll be glad you did! 9/10 Bethany Cox.",/review/rw2346300/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2004,Boba_Fett1138,8," Good quality entertainment.
","I'm not one of those persons who praises ""Shrek"" all the time as one of the greatest movies ever made, like many other persons seem to do. Quite frankly I never really understood what the hype was all about. But still you have to give credit to this movie, it's very entertaining and fun to watch over and over again.",/review/rw2346300/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2005,nickfortis,9," Beautifully computer-animated fairy tale: a gentle morality play, very skillfully done.
","I'm an old dude, 75 to be exact, and in my working days I was everything from a mainframe programmer to a HiTech startup Tech Admin. This sentence is here only to show why I am interested in the productions of Dreamworks and, of course, Pixar. Coming from a computer background permits me to be very, very impressed with the wonderful skill and creativity that go into making movies such as Shreck.",/review/rw2346300/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2005,ryan_kuhn,8," ""Do you know... the muffin man?""
","The Simpsons has been one of my favorite TV shows, and for the same reason that I like the Simpsons is what makes Shrek so good. The Simpsons takes the children-only medium of cartoons and makes an adult show out of it, with jokes in it that only adults will find amusing, some for adult eyes' only. Shrek is animation, a beautiful computer animation that looks realistic and bold, has enough kiddy humor in it to make the kids like it, but has even more jokes that adults will love. It's the cross between childhood innocence and adult knowledge that brings Shrek so many laughs. Mike Myers supplies the voice of Shrek, an ogre who enjoys living by himself in his swamp on the outskirt of Duloc, a near-perfect kingdom ran by the insecure Lord Farquaad, voice with wonderful swarmy-ness by John Lithgow. When Farquaad begins to deposit all of the mythical creatures that populate his kingdom into Shrek's swamp, Shrek demands to see the king, and only the smart-ass Donkey knows the way. Donkey is a sassy talking, well, donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy and is the Lou Costello to Shrek's Bud Abbot--to say Shrek is the straight man in this odd couple is an understatement. After meeting the king, Shrek and Donkey then have a quest of finding Fraquaad Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), an imprisoned lady guarded by a dragon. I personally would have gone with Snow White, but to each their own. What also sets Shrek apart from other animated movies is the music, mostly rock music, mostly from Smashmouth. I do not think a Disney picture would have made the same selections. It gives it a different feel from the usual animated fare, Shrek for sure has it's own identity. Getting back to the animation, the computer generated scenery and characters are great to look at, very lifelike, even the human beings. Pixar, who has made films such as Toy Story and Finding Nemo, has made it clear that human beings are the most difficult objects to animate on computers, but I think DreamWorks got it right in Shrek--there is nothing there that makes me say ""that does not look right."" There are great in-jokes about the world of childhood stories, while sprinkling in some very adult humor. The best sight gags for me revolve around Farquaad interrogating a gingerbread man and threatening a magic mirror. Shrek will entertain and amuse the young and old alike.",/review/rw2346300/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2001,agc110,," Left-field fairy tale left us rolling in the aisles
","9 OUT OF 10!!!! We went to catch the matinee preview of ""Shrek"". We were still giggling by the time we got home afterwards. Two hours later, we dragged a friend out and went back for the evening show. Some of the shock value was lost, but we caught a few of the background sight gags we missed the first time, and anticipation of some of the other scenes had us in tears before they even happened. Interesting to see the different audience reactions of different age groups, too. This is a *very* funny movie, but it should be noted that most of the kiddy humour is on the burp/fart and yucky dining habits level - Shrek is rather closely related to Raymond Briggs' Fungus the Bogeyman without the orange mohawk. The dialogue and main action quips are mainly aimed at adults and sophisticated kids. One little voice in the afternoon audience piping up ""WHAT's he compensating for?"" cracked me up...",/review/rw2346300/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2001,Hitchcoc,9," It's In the Background
","I want this on video so I can watch parts of it selectively. The story is fun, the animation sensational, but seeing it only once in a theater didn't allow me time to scope out all the sight gags. I loved the background images, the schtick that Shrek does because he is an ogre and as gross as they come. But it went by so fast. Since I saw a stage version of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, I have thoroughly enjoyed films and plays that have a bunch of significant action going on around the characters that are currently being focused on. The ""real"" plot, so to speak. The fairy tale world that is the setting of this animated joy, is what I really want to see. These characters, who are parts of lots of little stories, go about their daily business, running from big bad wolves or being left to follow bread crumbs. Meanwhile Shrek, being a kind ogre, must put up with the constant pleas of the fairy tale populace, who make nuisances of themselves.",/review/rw2346300/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2007,Chrysanthepop,," The story of an Ogre, a Princess and a Donkey
","Everything about 'Shrek' has probably already been said but here's my little comment. 'Shrek' is definitely one of the most enjoyable flicks. There has been tremendous work put in the animation process. Yet, the makers haven't given the screenplay any less considerations and we are told a heartwarming but relevant story. Though the characters of Shrek, Fiona and Donkey are original (maybe Donkey is from the Musicians of Bremen?), we also meet various fairy tale characters spoofed into the screenplay providing us several hilarious moments.",/review/rw2346300/?ref_=tt_urv

","Shrek is an awesome movie! Based in the ordinary fairy tales,the main thing here is to break the rules and the enchantment of those stories and show it all in a different way; Why the prince needs to be so perfect? Why the princess needs to be so beautiful?Why they need to live in a perfect castle?Why can't the royals be problematic? All of these answers are more than answered in Shrek. By the way, this is a movie with lots of humor. :)So, be prepare to laugh. (Donkey is annoying, but the biggest part of the fun comes from him!)",/review/rw2346300/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2003,llltdesq,8," Not perfect, but quite good and hilarious quite often.
","This most assuredly is not a perfect film, but it is a marvelous send-up of the fairy-tale genre and the script is great.  This has romance, humor, a talking donkey, no car chases and makes fun of The Mouse.  What more could you ask for?  Movie spoofs and karaoke?  It has those too.  Most harrowing performance by gingerbread?  You betcha!  The voicework is spot on and even Eddie Murphy is enjoyable.  Great fun is had by all (except Michael Eisner-I'd love to have been a fly on the wall in Eisner's office the morning after this copped the Oscar for Animated Feature).  Very entertaining and well worth your time.  Most recommended.",/review/rw2346300/?ref_=tt_urv

12 September 2001,Reneewill5,," Shrek is a delight for all ages!
","Shrek is a movie like no other.  It stands alone in its appeal to people of all ages and in its presentation of comedy, romance, and creative story line.  Shrek is a delightful comedy about a crude ogre, an energetic princess, a witty donkey and an uptight ruler.    The movie has a brilliant story line, following the path of an initially moody ogre as he discovers friendship and love all in the face of hysterical comedy.  The story line is layered for different levels of understanding; it is an enjoyable film for people of all ages.  One clever tool Shrek uses to humor the audience is its spoof on other fairy tales.  In one scene, Princess Fiona's singing causes a bluebird to explode.  And in another scene, the Magic Mirror's description of Snow White is ""She may live with seven men, but don't be fooled, she's not easy.""  While these subtle comedic lines amuse adults, it is the simple humor, such as the movie opening with the ogre sitting in a swamp ""farting,"" that amuses children.  The amazing cast of Shrek, including Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers does a great job of living up to their comedic expectations. Shrek has something for everyone; it is a great animated tale that is wonderful for adults and children alike.",/review/rw2346300/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't know if we could live in this world right now if you have not seen Shrek. I wasn't sure if I'd make it, because at the time that Shrek came out, I refused to see it. I wasn't into the computer animation, so I refused to see it, not to mention all the hype annoyed me. You know when a movie is over advertised, and sometimes that drives you more away than closer? That was my situation, but I'm glad I finally decided to give Shrek a chance.",/review/rw2346300/?ref_=tt_urv
