11 February 2004,TxMike,," Guest and Levy orchestrate a nice tribute to the 1960s folk groups.
","We have a duo, a trio, and a group of 9. These three fictitious 'folk' groups from the 60s reunite for a concert in this mockumentary. What makes it so interesting is (1) I was a young adult in the 60s and vividly remember the folk group wave and (2) Guest, Levy and the others do their own singing and playing of songs they wrote for the movie. I think its IMDb ratings which cluster around 7 and 8 are about right. Not everyone will like 'A Mighty Wind' (song from final concert), it has improvised humor and many of the same actors from 'Best in Show'. But for fans of the humor of Guest and Levy it is a very nice little movie. The DVD has interesting extras, and the commentary track by Guest and Levy discuss how, for example, Levy had to take lessons to get is guitar skills back, and how O'Hara learned to play the autoharp for this role.",/review/rw1611342/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2004,Gavno,8," I thought I was the only one who saw the joke here!!!
","In the '60s and '70s, I was a MAJOR folk music fan, and a (very bad) would-be performer; I still have my old Yamaha guitar tucked away in a closet. For years now I've been a second shift engineer at the local PBS TV station... I'm the guy who runs the videotape while the SANE people around here are at home.",/review/rw1611342/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2004,FilmOtaku,8," Hilarious!
","Another in a long list of films that have been recommended to me, `A Mighty Wind' was probably one of the funniest films I've seen this century.  The mockumentary style of `This is Spinal Tap' has always been a favorite of mine, and this film, about the reunion of three folk groups after the death of the owner of their former record label is absolutely hilarious. Christopher Guest's usual cast is involved, though Eugene Levy and Harry Shearer stood out for me personally.  (Although every time Shearer's character spoke I couldn't get the image of Principal Skinner from `The Simpsons' out of my head.)",/review/rw1611342/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2005,alana-dill,9," Doesn't have to be mean to be funny
","Some felt that this was too close to reality to be considered a parody, but I thought it was beautifully done - made fun of the cloying smugness of some ""folkies"", but mixed it with genuine pathos. I have a feeling Eugene Levy may have lost a couple of friends to bad acid trips - his portrayal was hilarious, but not cruel. Christopher Guest continues to amaze me with his light touch; most comedies put people in bad situations and make them squirm their way through; instead Guest takes apparently mediocre characters and puts them in situations that stretch their personalities.

8 October 2004,tarzan61,," ""I would love to see this town in the autumn...""
","It's amazing how well executed this movie is. It seems realisic and yet so...""movie!"" Christopher Guest (who did a fine ""guest"" on Saturday Night Live in a game show skit...""Chocolate Babies?"") did some great work on this and all of the characters are classic. Eugene Levy may be the best in this. His performance of Mitch, or rather the shell of what Mitch once was is hilarious. The best scene is, in my opinion, the scene in which Mickey's wife shows Mitch his model trains and model town. Levy's comments about seeing the town in the autumn (""I would have made tiny leaves..."") are the funniest lines in the film. The Folksmen show off funny interaction scenes (yep, those are the guys from Spinal Tap) and The New Mainstreet Singers are definitely the commercial b*st*rds of this film. W.I.N.C.-a religion based on color. That's classic. I would recommend getting the DVD for the great deleted scenes, including a press conference in which Mitch talks about Canadian hip-hop, where kids rap about cleanliness.

3 July 2020,matthewssilverhammer,10," Guest's underrated masterpiece.
","It's of course hilarious, but it's also his only mockumentary with real heart, and boy does it work. O'Hara and Levy lean on their decades of natural chemistry to make their post-romance relationship both gut-bustingly funny and sensibly sad. All three of the groups are uniquely perfect, and their musical performances are inspired. And if anyone wonders what made Fred Willard so beloved, just watch his tour de force introduction in this movie...it's everything.",/review/rw1611342/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2004,bsl9,," Subtle Bull's Eye
","Christopher Guest's movies, like his performances, are generally subtle and always low-key. They are not for people who need laugh tracks to follow the humor and most of his work is so contextually-based that some knowledge of the subject he's dissecting is a definite asset. Guest, who was a performer in the very early SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, is, in many respects, the Anti-Belushi of modern American comedy.",/review/rw1611342/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2020,cricketbat,8," This movie is retro, but it feels so now-tro
","I am continually amazed with how Christopher Guest is able to create a world that's so bizarre, yet so realistic. With A Mighty Wind, he's cultivated a collection of catchy folk songs that are so fun to listen to. I own the soundtrack and I absolutely love it. This film also features an emotional climax that's so simple, yet so effective. This movie is retro, but it feels so now-tro.",/review/rw1611342/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2006,planktonrules,9," beautiful homage to folk music--with a little bit of humor to boot
","This movie is a lot different than its predecessor, BEST IN SHOW. While most of the cast is a reprise of this earlier film, A MIGHTY WIND is a lot more subtle and more of a homage to folk music instead of a parody. BEST IN SHOW was laugh out loud funny, while A MIGHTY WIND is more of a well-made imitation of the sounds of 60s folk music. And, surprisingly, the cast of non-singers do an incredible job. In fact, some of the music is very catchy and you will probably find yourself tapping your toes EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE FOLK MUSIC. In particular, the ""SPINAL TAPPERS"" (Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKeon) sound almost exactly like the Kingston Trio! And, while Eugen Levy and Catherine O'Hara are not great singers, they make the absolute most of their talents in this sweet little film. Watch it for the occasionally funny moments and watch to see what a spot-on recreation the actors do of this medium.",/review/rw1611342/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2015,anaconda-40658,10," A Mighty Blast!
","A Mighty Wind (2003): Dir: Christopher Guest / Cast: Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Bob Balaban, Fred Willard, Michael McKean: Fascinating comic documentary about folk music. Title suggests an emerging of something that once was and will be again. After a folk music promoter dies his son Jonathan decides to reunite talent he represented for a benefit concert. Among those artists are the Folksmen who reunite after thirty years. The Street Singers are very passionate about their involvement. Finally there is Mitch and Mickey who sing ""A Kiss At the End of the Rainbow."" This opens an interesting subplot regarding Mitch's split with Mickey and the nervous breakdown that followed. Their signature song always concluded with a kiss. Great setup with often amusing interviews with participants. Directed by Christopher Guest who previously made Waiting for Guffman. Scene stealing performances by Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as Mitch and Mickey whose scenes provide the best humour. Bob Balaban plays Jonathan who frantically struggles to arrange this event. Fred Willard is always funny and here he makes an appearance and laughs at his own jokes. Then we have Michael McKean jamming away with the Folksman alongside Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer. Wonderful portrayal of folk music and a time that will breeze through one more time. Score: 10 / 10",/review/rw1611342/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2010,theowinthrop,10," Actually a Comedy that has a Charm of its Own.
","A MIGHTY WIND is not a simple sequel to the earlier comedy spoof THIS IS SPINAL TAP. There was nothing in that film that was really moving (the death of the drummers in the band became an occupational hazard after awhile). Instead, A MIGHTY WIND is a bittersweet film about the passing of a briefly appreciated musical trend, but more important the tragedy of two of that trends celebrities in the failure of their marriage. For the marriage of Mitch and Mickey (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara) becomes the centerpiece of our attention by the last third of the film.",/review/rw1611342/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2008,fedor8,," A little disappointing.
","The weakest in Guest's series of mockumentaries, but still enjoyable. The casting is predictably clever, but it seems that the improvisation wasn't working that well this time around; there are several scenes that contain nothing even vaguely humorous about them. I like Guest's subtle style, but perhaps AMW's humour is too subtle for its own good. If you're going to go after country music, especially the more commercial crap, then you ought to go for the jugular. No ""Police Academy""-type nonsense, of course, but a little more energy would have done the movie good.",/review/rw1611342/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2020,CubsandCulture,10," Guest's and Company's best film
","The mockumentry, popularized in American cinema by This is Spinal Tap, can sometimes end up being merely funny. The shooting style of a ton of improvisation and loose plotting often has the films end up being a series of gags with no emotional meat to them. This film avoid this pitfall and the Mitch & Mickey storyline gives the an emotional payoff that is lacking in, say, Best in Show. A lot of it has to do with Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara knowing each other so well and both turning in utterly darling performances but it was also happenstance that the Kiss at the End of the Rainbow ended up having as much pathos as it does.",/review/rw1611342/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2011,drqshadow-reviews,8," Dry, Subtle, Ad-Libbed Comedy With a Big Heart
","Christopher Guest and company tackle the super-cheesy folk music scene of the '60s in their own unmistakable way. While its status among Guest's other pictures could be debated, I don't think there's any question it's his most complete effort. Tremendously funny at points, it also tells a straight, coherent story and ties in a stunning successful emotional hook. The laughs aren't quite as loud or as rapid-fire as they were in Spinal Tap; however, the tone also isn't nearly as flippant, which is a major reason why it's able to settle down and deliver something truly sweet at the climax. Of course, the original music is once again outstanding, with lyrics that are more subtly funny and not nearly as brazen, and is spectacularly performed by the cast of ad-lib legends. It's an ensemble piece in every definition of the word, with the mockumentary style of the first sixty minutes providing more than enough background to emotionally invest its audience for the grand finale in Town Hall. Effectively funny and heartwarming in even doses, A Mighty Wind is a great continuation of the troupe's legacy.",/review/rw1611342/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2005,angler-2,9," Eugene Levy
","Eugene Levy as ""Mitch"" of Mitch and Mickey, is nothing short of brilliant in the character he has created. Actually, less created than inhabited. Though clearly teetering on the edge of sanity, he manages to keep a tenuous grip on reality. His eyes, his voice, his hands--every inch of Eugene is invested in the character. Even after having seen this film several times, and enjoying it each and every time, I always get the feeling that one never knows what Mitch is going to say or do next, and it's because Mitch doesn't know either.",/review/rw1611342/?ref_=tt_urv

26 January 2010,winner55,6," watchable misfire
","There are two substantial problems with this film, neither making it unwatchable, although I confess they did make me feel uncomfortable. The first is that director Guest cannot capture any of the various ""documentary"" camera styles widely known with the necessary degree of accuracy; this isn't cinema verite, nor do we get successful sequences of talking heads. Even the concert scenes fail to emulate concert documentaries. Visually, then, we are always reminded that we are not watching a documentary but a mockumentary - we can't really allow ourselves the 'willing suspension of disbelief' such a satire requires from us. This problem is exasperated by some of the actors' performances who are trying way too hard to be funny, rather than play straight and let the ridiculous situations call out laughter.",/review/rw1611342/?ref_=tt_urv

","Christopher Guest created a quartet of pseudo-documentaries with ""A Mighty Wind"", about a bunch of folk singers getting together when their producer dies. The movie lets the audience see everyone's personalities develop as the movie progresses, namely with the ""ninny/nonny"" scene, and ""now-tro"". Probably the most intriguing character is Eugene Levy as the mentally whacked Mitch; I still wonder what he was thinking about during his performances! ",/review/rw1611342/?ref_=tt_urv
