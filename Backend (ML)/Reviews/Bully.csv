28 July 2004,dee.reid,10," ""Bully"" (*****)
","The teenagers viewed at the center of Larry Clark's ""Bully"" seem, at least to me, to really have nothing going for them. They have sex almost on a constant basis, drink, smoke pot, drop acid, and have reckless, meaningless lives. It might appear that ""Bully"" could possibly be a darker continuation of his 1995 outing ""Kids,"" which also focused on endangered youth, but I think the questions at this film's core run deeper.",/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2002,Quinoa1984,8," So stark in it's from-a-true-story fashion it borders on personal ground
","There's something about the kids in Larry Clark's films, such as this, Bully, and his 1995 classic Kids (which took place in New York and had the feel of an un-interviewed documentary), where the characters are brought so vividly to life, and their contemplations and actions in their dead-end lives, that I get reminded of the people I was around back in my grade school days (I've been out of the public school system for six months now). I remember the lay-abouts, the complainers, the overly medicated, and of course I remember the bullies, laying on abuse that sometimes they weren't even aware they were inflicting.

16 November 2005,boyinflares,9," What If Your Kids Turned Out Like This?
","Controversial director Larry Clark's based on real-life events ""Bully"" is sometimes quite hard to watch, but you can't quite stop yourself from watching the misadventures of these messed up children either. This film feels so real, so nitty-gritty, that at times, you may feel like an intruder, watching someone else's life. These children are so far removed from being children, it is hard to think that they actually are just children. After all, the concept of a group of kids killing their so-called friend, well, its hardly child's play now is it? The cast are great. Brad Renfro is top-notch in all his performances, here is no exception. Bijou Phillips is great, Rachel Miner is cunning, Kelli Garner is a lot of fun, Michael Pitt is slightly annoying, but entertaining nonetheless. Nick Stahl is intense, to say the least.",/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2004,psemmes,," I'd like to clear up some misconceptions about this movie
","It seems that the reviews of this movie are rather bleak because people say that the director focused too much on sex and that this was not a realistic picture for teens. I watched the movie, and read the book, and I have another reference source- my mother was a juror for the court case State of Florida Vs. Ali Willis and Donny Semenec. She was sequestered for over a month and was told every piece of information about these two teenagers and their friends. ",/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2004,The_Void,7," Excellent true story thriller
","Larry Clark first shocked the film world in 1995 with the explicit and relentless 'Kids'; and that's the movie he has become known for, and will be remembered for. However, Bully is a superior movie in every way.",/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2002,brandonsites1981,," * * *1/2 out of 4. Top 10 of 2001!
","Raw, realistic, deeply disturbing and haunting film about a group of recently graduated high school kids whose lives are aimless and empty. With nothing better to do, they get together to plot the murder of their mean best friend (Nick Stahl), who was the only one bound for college and to make something of himself. With none of your usual Hollywood gloss and a well selected cast (especially Stahl in a creepy performance), this film has many powerful moments and completely draws you into it's story. Shockingly enough, based on a true story.",/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2007,jellybellybean11-1,," Attn: Parents
","I just watched this movie, and I found it interesting and compelling enough to check the IMDb site. I have always found Larry Clarks movies captivating, and this one was no exception. However when i was reading through the reviews I saw people constantly referring to the teens lives as ""empty and meaningless"", using their pot smoking and sex as examples.",/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2005,stebmarc,9," Frighting and believable, must see for parents
","This is a interesting and frightening film, worth a viewing by every parent of teenage children. Whether they know it or not, their children at least know children like these; they are living in a world that includes this reality. Some of the best insights are in the portrayals of the parents.",/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2006,bob the moo,," Interesting and natural but nowhere near as insightful or socially important as it thinks it is and should have been
","Marty and Bobby are friends who work together, drink together, pick up girls together and hustle together. The dynamics of their friendship is not that straightforward though as Bobby is by far the dominant one and thinks nothing of demeaning and bullying Marty and having fun exploiting anyone he sees as below him. While highschool drop out Marty gets Lisa pregnant, Bobby's future looks good with college and his father's support ahead of him  all this despite raping Lisa's friend Ali. When enough is enough Bobby's friends decide to kill him.",/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2004,oneflewovertheapocalypse,," I had a nightmare about this film
","I loved the way Kid's presented itself when it was first released, if I had it my way then that film would be shown to all the kids in high school's all over the world because the reality of what is going on in each character really hits home when watching this and I think it might make a lot of young kids think before what they do.   Anyway that was my introduction to Larry Clark and the amazing Leo Fitzpatrick and when I had heard not long ago that these two got together and made another harrowing teen film called Bully I just had to watch it but apart of me wishes I didn't watch it because I scared me in a way because of how real it was.   Leo Fitzpatrick is not the lead star in this one though, this one is left to Brad Renfro (Marty) and Nick Stahl (Bobby) who are two best friends who live in world where they sell phone sex for gay people and make homosexual films to sell to porn shops, just you're average teenager of course, but Bobby is a dominating friend towards Marty and Marty just breaks and decides with his vulnerable girlfriend that they should kill Bobby so he won't be a problem in their lives, from there we are taken into this dark tale of teenage revenge. There is a big build to what happens in this film and that's what makes it harrowing viewing because you just don't know what is going to happen. But by the time the film had ended I straight away bombarded the internet with information about the real happening of what actually went on.",/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2005,noizyme,7," Larry Clark's great movie about real-life killers and their personality problems
","I, like tons of 20-somethings trying to relive their youth, picked up KIDS, the first movie from Larry Clark, a director who loves reality to the point of bypassing actual actors for kids on the street in almost every movie he makes. He loves crime and the demeanor of kids in their early stages of understanding society and people around them.",/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2003,sixxroxx,10," Too close to home......
","After a friend of mine died in such a similar way, I began to research this story. The real story. I followed all court trials, read all the articles and books. This movie, BULLY, is an excellent portrayal of what really happened. The actors do a great job, especially Nick Stahl, who is the total best. This movie is not for weak stomachs, it is totally gruesome and it holds nothing back. Freaking excellent. If you like true crime and haven't seen this movie, check it out. I give it a 10+++++. NICK STAHL RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2006,Jonny_Numb,8," A film that bruises like no other...
","Forget ""Hostel."" Forget ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remakes. As a matter of fact, forget anything in the last decade that's been marketed under the banner of 'horror.' Larry Clark, director of ""Kids"" and ""Another Day in Paradise,"" wants to take you to the real-life school of Horrific Hard Knocks with ""Bully,"" a terrifying account of a group of teens who got sick of a peer's abuse, decided to kill him...and did.",/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2005,colleen_71286,9," Great acting...A haunting movie that stays with you
","I watched this movie five days ago and I'm still affected by it. Afterwards all I could do was cry for the youth of America, because this isn't just some movie. It really, truly happened. The actors turn in outstanding performances as teenagers with nothing to do but turn to sex and drugs to fill the empty voids in their lives. Nick Stahl is particularly amazing as Bobby, the boarder-line psychotic who tormented his friends until they could take it no more.This is a sad, realistic look at how many teenagers really do act with their peers. Don't look for your typical teenager fare here because you won't find it. The language, sex, and drug use may bother some people, but thats because no one wants to believe that young adults can be this way. Well, I got out of high school two years ago and I can tell you that this is not far from reality. Thats probably why it has affected me so much...because I know that stuff portrayed in this movie really does happen. This is a great movie. Watch it. Then go tell your kids you love them.",/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv

16 July 2006,Superunknovvn,5," Clichéd and exploitative
","""Bully"" is another chapter in Larry Clark's continuing crusade to tell everyone that the kids aren't alright. Even before I learned that this was a Clark-movie I noticed the obvious similarities to his previous piece, ""Kids"". Whereas ""Kids"" was frightening in its realism, ""Bully"" is annoyingly blunt. Everybody's a slut, a dope-head or a rapist. Motivations are not elaborated on. Characters just love, hate and abuse each other for no apparent reason at all. Maybe that in itself is the message Clark is trying to convey, but it's not very plausible, let alone interesting to watch. What's worse is that the director doesn't miss any opportunity to show some underage nudity, rape and sex scenes. Hey, we all have the ""based on a true story"" label to fall back on, right? Ugh, it doesn't get much more clichéd and exploitative than this. Look for some new topics please, Mr. Clark!",/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2005,digg5555,9," Portrays the decadent and violent reality of teen life today
",Very real and compelling portrayal of a murder involving a group of teens growing up in suburban Florida. I could relate to the characters on many levels. Growing up in suburban Philadelphia I could have easily replaced the characters in the movie with people I in knew in my youth. It was a rude reminder of just how easily things can spiral out of control if you get involved with the wrong crowd and put yourself in such a precarious situation.,/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2004,helpless_dancer,8," Idle hands are the devil's workshop
","Did these kids have zero supervision or what? Most of their parents walked around in a dream state as to what was going on in their childrens' lives. Apparently the brats were well cared for financially because they always had their smokes, booze, dope, and nice cars. The bully certainly deserved to have some serious ass-whup put on his worthless, perverted hide and so did his killers. What a worthless collection of sexual deviants, crybabies, and tough guy wannabes. This picture proves what I've said for a long time: if you want to kill someone; do it alone, bury the body deep, and never tell a soul - not even your own mother. These blabbermouths couldn't wait for even one day before they began spreading their evil deeds all over town. The stupids deserved their fate.",/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2003,Curtis G.,7," Brad Renfro is an ACTOR

6 November 2005,Doylenf,7," Makes the teen alienation of ""Rebel Without A Cause"" look quaint by comparison...
","Surfing on TV I came across this unknown film (unknown to me, anyway), and was quickly drawn into the story despite the most unlikeable, mindless bunch of foul-mouthed, acid dropping teens ever brought to life on the screen. Only later did I find out this was based on a true story of an incident that happened in Florida among a bunch of fairly affluent high school dropouts given little supervision by parents and bent on self-destruction.",/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2015,Movie-ManDan,9," Uncomfortable and Awesome.
","Bully is based on the real life murder of Bobby Kent in 1993. Iconic Brad Renfro leads a cast of young upstarts in a movie that (I'm sure) does justice to the real case. If not, and the movie was changed for dramatic purposes, it was changed perfectly. Despite there being great acting by a great cast, the violence is gory and there's lots of explicit sex. So I recommend watching this alone. Honestly, the abundance of sex is a drawback.",/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2002,Infofreak,," 'River's Edge' for a new decade?
","Larry Clark certainly seems to push people's buttons, which is alright by me if he continues to make movies as good as 'Bully'. I really enjoyed his previous movie 'Another Day In Paradise' which was sadly overlooked. 'Bully' is closer to the provocative material of 'Kids' and therefore is getting a lot more attention. Whether it is actually better than '..Paradise' is debatable, but even so it's a very good movie just the same. This is a realistic and believable look at the dark side of contemporary suburban teens, which brings to mind Tim Hunter's 80s classic 'The River's Edge', which was also based on fact. Clark manages to make a solid, well acted and thought provoking drama while simultaneously making a sleazy exploitation movie that would have done Roger Corman, Samuel Z. Arkoff and A.I.P. proud! A difficult feat but Clarke effortlessly pulls it off. I think in years to come 'Bully' will look better and better. Right now it's essential viewing. Highly recommended.",/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2006,luckyhb13,1," Boring, boring, ...
","Lots of teeny/twenty something viewers will wax indignant if one can't see this as a brilliant piece of art. However, if Larry Clark is a genius then why does he deal with the blindingly obvious? Virtually every kid I know has behaved like this; I behaved like this when I was a kid - jeez I'll bet even some of our parents did. Okay - apart from the murder part. It does misuse the 'based on a true story' to portray events - from what I have read it is very, very loosely based on a true story. ",/review/rw1444460/?ref_=tt_urv
