25 March 2022,trademarcdesigns,10," Beautifully acted
","You know the actors are talented when they can draw you into a drama in a language you don't understand. Halfway through the first episode I was fully invested in the story, transported to another time and place, caring about the fate of the characters.",/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,yooniverse,10," Just beautifully told
","If you've watched enough Korean dramas, you'd know that the story elements are not new revelations. They're an amalgamation of the history of Korea, and well-worn themes and stories of real lives of Koreans who've suffered at the hands of the Japanese, and the clash of cultures, attitudes, bigotry, hatred and cruelty, across Korean, Japanese and westerners. It's easy to forget that this was less than a hundred years ago, and spanning only a few decades; and so often, the bitterness still felt by Koreans leads to a heavy handed portrayal of the Japanese and westerners. It's a fine line to walk to be able tell a story about generations of a family and their personal struggles without getting lost in that bitterness.",/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,DukeEman,9," An epic Korean saga that avoids the K-drama pitfalls...
","Pachinko avoids the cliches of the K-drama, instead settles for an European soap drama style with plenty of depth, chronicling the plight of a Korean family under the Japanese occupation and juxtaposing that with life in 1989, all in brilliant cinematic storytelling.",/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2022,nkiliuzo,10," Amazing, just amazing
","I literally do not have words to describe how good this show is, the transition between time periods, the history and the way the story is told, the actjng has been sublime, cinematography is A+, Just the whole package has been a treat, am not really a big fan of kdrama but this feels different, very different, well done apple+ for this show.",/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,PardonTheTruth,10," Remarkable
","Wow! What a truly mind-blowing rendition of one of the most moving novels in recent history. The casting, direction, acting and cinematography are all equally exceptional.",/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,Dillydaydream,10," Perfect in every way
","I really loved the book and was slightly worried if this series would do it justice- but wow the critics were right
this is wonderful. Everything was right- the acting, the directing, the incredible script, the music. The life-affirming opening dance was a surprise but so right. The three Sunjas are perfect in the part which we would expect
from Youn Yuh-Jung but the two younger actresses were just as good. For a newcomer Minha Kim is astounding.",/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2022,gstrongheart-22158,10," Lovely
",I'm watching the show but also reading the book. I would recommend reading the book as their is certain things that do not happen in the show and some things that have been added why I don't know . The book is a must it carries the story much better. I can't put it down that why I had to write this review because the boo is so good..üëçüòÅ,/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2022,Yeolo,10," Critics didn't lie!
","Critics have proclaimed Pachinko is one of the best TV series you'll ever see in 2022 and that's saying a lot! And I can attest from first 4 episodes, they did not lie or exaggerate! Loved the book and this tv adaptation is as good! Can't wait to watch more and praying for seasons 2+",/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,Bonniekoh,10," The best TV series of the year
","After watching the three episodes, I may deeply realize the artistic attainments of the director. The composition is beautiful, the picture is magnificent, and every frame is eye-catching. I can see that every actor has made a lot of efforts to shape the character. I believe that everyone who has experienced immigration can find resonance in it. Will continue to follow up on new episodes.",/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2022,cameliasispir,8," Great cinematography
","Great cinematography, indeed- also costumes, locations, etc- technically all perfect, and very good casting. The script does not follow the book, which changes the view on characters, giving them different vibe - and also the jumping timelineis done so often and sometimes in the middle of the scene, that it does not allow the build-up of atmosphere, is pushing so many characters at the same time and prevents the viewer to really get to know them. I believe a linear story line would have been more beneficial by allowing viewers to connect to the characters, immerse in the story and also illuminate the attitude of the next generation. It seems a bit rushed and does not really gives that feeling of the family saga. Special Kudos for Kim Minha, who nailed her first leading role, and excellent performance from Lee Min Ho was perfect in Hansu. They succeeded also in expressing the relation between their characters, which is not described even in the book as love, but as passion between a 40 years old man in a loveless marriage and an innocent teenager. Looking forward to see the next episodes !",/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2022,phd_travel,10," A step forward for K drama
",This series sets new standards for K drama. Cinematography and production values are big budget movie quality. The Western influences in the approach and story are apparent. It has the flavour and epic sweep of a European 19th Century novel. Movies and series showing bad things Japanese people did haven't been that popular recently maybe for political reasons. So this series is remarkable for those who seem to not realise who the villains of Asia in the 20th Century actually were.,/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2022,sarahcarter-57143,10," Moving story
",Opened an Apple TV account just to watch this and I'm so glad I did the acting is superb by everybody lee min ho who at 35 must be sick and tired of acting in light fluffy chaste k dramas and be a able to play a more meaty grown up role including a love scene which was tame and very short by Hollywood standards but still felt very real the actresses who played the young and teenage female leads were impressive especially as it was a first time acting job I was hooked right from the start and cried with her When she found out he was married with children and he was not serious about their relationship wanting her as a mistress on the side can't wait for the next episodes and will be buying the book to read as well if you have never watched a k drama before ( I have watched hundreds) I would recommend this one as your first it's so good.,/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2022,lunarhunter,10," Just a great Show
","This is a damn good show. Casting is flawless. Even the opening credit scene is Aces, good job Michael Hill on the music. I can't believe they filmed this in Vancouver Canada .",/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,thilothimohandas,10," Pachinko
",All are set in right place. The cinemotagraphy and the visuals of cast and the story telling. It never disappointed. And Leeminho nailed hansu role. His role is really tough. His convey all his emotions in his stare. Young sunja is lived as character. Waiting to see the remaining episodes.,/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2022,fredricwilliams,," Captions critical -- and not competent
","This work absolutely lives or dies by captioning. Unless you are fluent in both Korean and Japanese, you cannot know what is happening without reading the captions.",/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2022,uditamohanta,9," This story truly touches the heart...
",This is no historical drama but a story of a women who endured the pain of the horrific historical time in which she was born. Triumphant the victory of survival against all odds flung in her way by sacrificing all ties with her roots.,/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2022,hugochoko,10," Unforgettable and Masterpiece
","Pachinko - a sprawling, stunning drama chronicling four generations of an immigrant Korean family - is truly ""it's time to start tossing around words like 'masterpiece'",/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2022,dvonhusen-41694,10," Gorgeous, moving, inspiring.
","This series is beautiful. Hits every emotion. I'm not one to explore all the fine facets of a movie or series. I simply watch and discover how it impacts me emotionally, visually. I will not forget this one.",/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,chrisking-56727,10," Watching it again and again
","I think Pachinko's narrative is clear, not disturbing, and makes one want to watch it again and again. It's a good show to watch. I watched the first three episodes over and over , and look forward to the new one. Although I started watching it because of Lee Min Ho, now the story has caught my eye and I can't wait to watch it.",/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv

",This drama is just amazing i loved the way Lee Min Ho performed ..story line is very unique and different...character or Lee Minho is totally different from his previous characters and he nailed it..noone can imagine that he is very playful and sweet person in real life that's awesome his acting is.,/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2022,jiwonoc,10," Lives up to all the hype
","As so many reviewers have proclaimed, Pachinko is tv at its best! This story following the trials, tribulations & triumphs of a pregnant Korean girl forced by circumstances to immigrate to oppressive Japan in early 20th century juxtaposes beautifully with her grandson's experiences as an up and coming banker in Japan in 1980s. Wonderfully emotional, compelling & educational series. You won't regret watching!",/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv

1 April 2022,toridarw,10," A Must Watch
","I know some people have mentioned being confused by the shifts in the timeline, but I actually enjoyed how the show transitions between timelines. Also, some might expect the show to be a complete replica of the book, but I actually appreciate and I am impressed with the creativity of the screen adaptation. Just remember that this not on a piece of paper or pages in a book. The show had to bring the book and characters to life and be creative. The Storytelling and the Cast Performances are just Outstanding. The show is a beautiful and well done adaptation of the book. I think it is a strong contender for awards. A Must Watch.",/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2022,yanrudaisy,10," THE BEST OF 2022
","I want to say the best of recent 10 years actually! It's definitely a masterpiece. Its acting, script, direct, and even filming is PERFECT. I cried ugly when I watched over it. The performance of Lee Minho is such a surprise for me, I can't believe it's Lee Minho. Isn't anyone looks like him? Thanks god, he breathe life to this character and I can't help screaming for Hansu.",/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,kxccmk,10," Work of masterpiece
",The graphics and music attracted me a lot which help many flashbacks and roles to pour in from the angle of sunja. The nationalism story was be told very indistinct but profound. I think Hollywood will prefer the way directors and actors of presenting their story.,/review/rw8003544/?ref_=tt_urv
