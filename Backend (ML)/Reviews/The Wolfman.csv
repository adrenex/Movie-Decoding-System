24 December 2022,Brisbanebogan,8," Despite its flaws a series full of potential
","If you are looking for historical accuracy you may want to look elsewhere but what Davis has delivered is a wry, intimate depiction of a royal family who, bored of their privilege, find purpose in tearing each other down. It doesn't quite match the production value of the Netflix & co behemoths but the costume and sets more than pull their weight.",/review/rw8767885/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2022,traceytak,8," Entertaining enough
","I binge watched this series and it was entertaining enough, the acting was good, the plots against Marie Antoinette were fun. I did feel as though the last episode didn't really need to be made, the series could have ended on episode seven and I would have looked forward to a season two far more. I started watching it thinking it would end with her demise (as in real life) but this series does not go anywhere near as far. If it is real history you're after, then this isn't it and you're better off getting the history books out. So I'm not sure I will be bothering with series two now, it appears that is going to focus more on relationships between MA and different men or women that are close to her which I think will be quite boring. Should have stopped at 7 episodes.",/review/rw8767885/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2023,rick-09019-01805,10," Top Notch douze points
",Been Binging on this today and i am really likeing the casting and acting beutiful costumes I never really knew anything about frech or Marie Antoinette ..except the famous line Let them eat cake that cost her her life . I kind of fealt for her because of the way she was raised and the inlaws being so cruel . I found my self engrossed and could not move away from the screen .. The whole casting works beutifully .. I could not decide if this was comedy i found Adelaïde and Victoire quiet entertaining i am on epidoe 4 and its 3.50 am. Usually i find period drams a little dry . But anyone who says this is bad or dry and has wacthed every episode they would be hippocrits msut of been good for them to watch it.,/review/rw8767885/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,Iaintnosnowdrop,10," Perfection on you screen.
",I cannot tell you how much I loved this. The acting is exquisite from all of the characters. . I didn't want it to end. Because we all know how it ends. Louis and Toinette are perfect casting. The whole story is fabulous. James Purefoy as the King is a great choice.. it really gets to you how hard it must have been for a fourteen year old to entertain the court . The Beeb normally woke things these days but not this one It's the best thing I've watched on the BBC in so long and they hid it on BBC2. Please watch it. You won't be disappointed. Apparently I have to make this review longer just to post it.,/review/rw8767885/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,toni-corelius,8," Total fiction but enjoyable.
","This should not be categorized as Biography but Romance Drama History. It is almost complete fiction. As someone who actually reads history books, I had to suspend all disbelief to enjoy it. And so I did once I accepted its true nature. One must understand that when dealing with history, there are facts. Take this as fiction and enjoy the production design, the cinematography, the costumes, the hair and makeup and most of all Emilia Schüle's joyful and effervescent perfomance!",/review/rw8767885/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,ambergris-04449,8," Really enjoyed this fresh take!
","I really loved this imagining of Marie Antoinette. It was full of drama and kept me hooked. The series is 8 episodes, and it feels well paced. I thought the costumes were amazing and all the actors fit their roles perfectly- especially Marie and Louis, who's relationship is explored in an interesting way! Though it's not always true to history(particularly with their use of modern phrases/sayings; something that slightly bothered me) , I would definitely recommend if you are a fan of period drama and costume, as it is interesting and fun to get the perspectives and motives of all the characters!",/review/rw8767885/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2023,karanmckelvie,9," Loved it!
","From what I've read about Marie Antoinette the actual story is fairly accurate. Okay there may be some inaccuracies but not anything important. The actors are brilliant and are completely believable, especially the awkward Louis. I felt genuine sadness for these people trapped inside their gilded cages, especially when we can see what is to come at their end. You get a real insight into how these people were just pawns in a power game. I was surprised and extremely pleased at how unPC it is, considering its made by the BBC but for once they put historical accuracy before virtue signalling. I cant see the point in making a historical drama thats not historical. Hope this is a sign of things to come, it's really good!",/review/rw8767885/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,diamondlace-02721,10," Best period drama in a while
","This is the best period drama I've come across in a long time. A lot of effort has gone into the hair, makeup and costumes and it shows. Even the quality of cinematography is super high.",/review/rw8767885/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,curiositirocks,6," Needs a little something extra
","Marie Antoinette's story is one that I'm very familiar with. I'd like to start off by saying that when it comes to historical inaccuracy, I don't mind allowing creative liberty/suspending my disbelief but I have to understand, to a certain extent, why these choices have been made. I feel as though the direction and some of the writing just didn't match up at all, especially at the beginning. It was almost like it couldn't decide whether it was an absurdist melodrama (a-la The Favourite, though minus the comedy), or a grounded re-telling of Marie Antoinette's life. If they had leaned more in the absurd direction visually, some of the more unbelievable plot-lines and happenings would have felt more watchable.",/review/rw8767885/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2023,roxmewild,5," Very Period Little Drama
",Being a big fan of Period dramas having watched most such as the Tudors Borgias and Versailles I was really looking forward to this latest one however after watching the first 4 episodes I am still waiting for any drama to begin! Admittedly this show scores high on costumes settings and cast seems adequate enough but there seems to be a big hole were the story is! Either this show is a very slow burner or the script writers have managed to write the story void of drama! I will continue to watch in the hope it picks up preferably before the subject of the series is Beheaded ! It is worth watching even if only for those glorious looking settings and costumes but for me it is not as good as Versailles was!,/review/rw8767885/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,maryrock90,5," Madame Deficit is on a tight budget this time around
","Having seen the Versailles drama series that came from the same production company, i was very well aware this wouldn't be a historically accurate depiction of MA's life as Queen of France. Versailles was character driven and relied heavily on drama but it balanced it out with actual historical events peppered throughout the 3 season span of the series.",/review/rw8767885/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,RastaVari,4," Extraordinary locations (unsurprisingly) &good cast can't make up for shockingly thin script/story and seemingly rushed production
","The writer(s) should frankly be ashamed of themselves, as there's barely anything there. Obviously the locations, the actual palace of Versailles etc., are utterly capitivating, and the costume, make up and cast are largely excellent, but despite their best efforts the lack of dialogue and apparent 'light touch' (I'm being kind) direction mean that minutes pass with nothing of note to focus on. Perhaps the beeb couldn't pass up the opportunity to have access to these palaces during low season/pandemic lockdowns so rushed ahead without a script... perhaps they thought the sumptuousness of the settings, symmetry of the actors and the detail and glamour of the design would distract from the missing story.... maybe the Netflixisation of media consumption meant that a story meant for three parts was stretched out, but whatever the reasons someone should have put their foot down. Its an entirely wasted opportunity and I had been looking forward to watching this and The Favourite but now have some serious trepidation, as its probably gonna be an emperors new clothes sitch.",/review/rw8767885/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2023,karolygrof,2," Boring and historically inaccurate
","The etiquette of any royal court or any court for that matter was way stricter that shown in this mockery of historical facts. This series is made for the uneducated masses, who are maybe even not able to read, but would enjoy a nicely composed picture. It is on the level of a 5 year old girl who lives in the fantasy being a princess.",/review/rw8767885/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2022,colinbroadley,5," Fun but historically inaccurate
","I've just binge watched this series in huge anticipation. Although the characters and story lines are fun and eccentric, they are horrifically historically inaccurate. Madame du Barry never plotted to marry Louis XV, she also never spoke to the Dauphine as she has no right to until Marie Antoinette spoke to her first. Their first public exchange did not involve MA bowing which would NEVER happen, the exchange took place at Versailles not at Fontainebleau.",/review/rw8767885/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2023,stevelivesey67,3," Stunning and brave.
","I think it is fabulous that the person who wrote The Favourite can bring us another stunning and brave, diverse piece of work that is totally different from the former. This time it is about the French!!",/review/rw8767885/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2023,rhiwderinray,4," Better than The Crown, but that isn't difficult!
","First Marie Antoinette was between 14 and 15 and Lois was 15, so why use two adult actors? This immediately starts the series off on the wrong foot. Versailles had strict protocol, so again history is forsaken for the sake of drama. At least the surroundings are better than the drama. Another ""historical"" series that panders to the uneducated and uncaring masses. It is fashion now to change or distort history in order to provide a soap opera. Again we are really only provided with a biased viewpoint instead of balance. Lets face it, these people were the super-rich, the Kardashians of their day, and they are probably best relegated to the dustbin of history. Their ending is well documented unlike the series. Hopefully the series will get the chop too!",/review/rw8767885/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2022,vaheadley,7," More Royalty done different
","Wasn't sure I could cope with another batch of royals this year but this one Marie Antoinette is so different that it doesn't feel Royal at all. They seem more like a bunch of poor little rich kids floating around in gaudy palaces. I can't help but compare to its most obvious rival(I think) being THE GREAT there are a few similarities, in their timelines & palaces etc but other than that...not really comparable. The witty script in THE GREAT is
.unrivalled and as well as the way it is delivered. The cast in THE GREAT particularly the two leads IS remarkable. They throw themselves with gusto...especially when smashing glasses & crying out loudly ""HAZZAH"" I could not help but get carried away with their enthusiasm. I hope they make several more seasons.",/review/rw8767885/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2022,getoh-82985,6," Lousy camerawork spoils an attractive production
","We have become accustomed to these sexed-up histories, full of colourful costumes, outrageous characters, and woke plotlines. But watching Marie Antoinette, one thing was immediately and painfully apparent - the lousy camerawork. Somebody decided to leave all the tripods, dollies, and gimbals in the truck, and do everything handheld (or so it would seem). Every single shot is a reminder of your elderly relative's wobbly 1990's camcorder footage. I could understand this approach for the action sequences like ballroom dances, horse riding, or fights, to put you right there in the action. But sadly every shot, however beautiful it should have been, from wide outdoor vistas, internal architecture and especially the many character close-ups, are all spoiled by an unnecessary and amateurish hand-held shake. This also wastes to some extent the fantastic level of detail provide by modern UHD shooting. So sad that the creators couldn't appreciate the difference between making a big-budget production and capturing wobbly mobile-phone junk for Tik-Tok.",/review/rw8767885/?ref_=tt_urv
