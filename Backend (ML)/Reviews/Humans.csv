7 April 2017,Jackbv123,9," Delightful
","Cassie is a magical woman. Not in the tradition of Samantha or Sabrina. It is hard to say that anything that would be considered true magic ever occurs. Cassie does have a habit of appearing out of nowhere, of knowing who is there before she sees them, and of saying just the right thing to make a ""coincidence"" happen where it is needed. This was true in the movies as in the TV series.",/review/rw4379360/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2021,lotrhp,5," The final season is extremely cringey
",The first few seasons were enjoyable and oh so typical of hallmark. It is a little bit of a sleepy show and there really isn't a ton of magic in the series but the final season makes me cringe. I also can't stand the character of joy. I really hate shows that do this whole will they won't they thing between guys and girls and then the girl turns out to be a lesbian. It's completely insulting to a normal person's intelligence. Also if joy was a man and she told a female that she needed to smile more all of the feminists would be furious but because she's a girl nobody bats an eye. I doubt I will even finish the season.,/review/rw4379360/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2021,jclark19-1,2," CANCELLED!
","I loved this show. I still like it, but it's not as good as it used to be. But I saw it coming at the beginning of this season. I knew it would suffer with the story line. New writers trying to make something this show into something it's not. Sad sad.",/review/rw4379360/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2021,pwpj11,4," Hey George, where's your wife, Gwen?
","Do the writers of this sappy show think viewers who have been watching since the ""The Good Witch"" movies have forgotten all the characters? I seem to recall George falling for Gwen and eventually getting married to her. Now that he's romancing another lady, where did he hide Gwen's body? In his garden?",/review/rw4379360/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2021,filmtempest,4," Skip season 7
","I used to like this positive, family friendly, albeit cheesy, series. It was a good watch that didn't have a lot of drama and any problems were usually solved by the end of the episode. Then the kids left for school, etc. And things went really down hill. It started in season 6 and then just crashed in season 7. It seems that Cassie was always sad after that, not the happy-to -help-others attitude she used to have. Plot lines stopped going places or abruptly ended, and new characters were added that just didn't fit the show. I know the show is called Good Witch and yes, several of the characters are witches but until season 7 it was never actually said, always just implied with more good deeds than actual magic. In season 7 it's more like the show Charmed than the Good Witch and it's mostly about the magic instead of the people. Stephanie's character takes a weird turn in her dating life which seems out of character for her. George, the grandfather, seems to be more into the magic than previously ever mentioned. Abigail has several plot lines that go nowhere. And is it just me or does it seem like the characters have replaced their tea drinking with alcohol in almost every scene? There is also an addition of a Lesbian character which seems out of place in this fictitious wholesome town and has angered many viewers. Overall it was a good show but I think that they tried to take it in a new direction that just didn't work for this type of audience. If you want to watch the show I recommend watching it up until Grace leaves for school and consider that the end, because the rest of the series really just doesn't add anything to the show.",/review/rw4379360/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2021,kisstamaralea,6," Sad changes
","Good witch was one of my favorite TV shows. It was calming, soothing, the perfect place to escape from reality for a while. I am so disappointed, that they ruined the seventh season. I miss the old Cassie, her advices, the atmosphere of Bell, book and candle, even the outfits and decorations. I will rewatch time to time the previous seasons and forget what the new writers have done to it.",/review/rw4379360/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2021,rg79912,2," It's lost its magic and has become boring, predictable, and now has an agenda. No thank you.
","I like the wholesomeness of Hallmark. The shows and movies are cheesy as can be, they're predictable and everything works out and everyone is happy. It's like an escape for me basically, because the real world is nothing like the Hallmark world, at least not for me or anyone I've ever known. I like that I don't have to worry about my kids walking in and seeing something inappropriate. This show and its movies have been something I didn't have to worry about my children watching with me. Now they've added an lgbtq story line and although so far it is very mild, I'm just truly burnt out on the lgbtq storylines in everything. So many shows I enjoyed have become overtaken by lgbtq story lines that completely overwhelmed the series and took center stage, while more often than not portraying a shallow, vain or often times entirely dysfunctional partnering. So, it was disappointing that they went that direction with Joy. I grew to somewhat like the character Joy towards the end of last season and I thought she had good chemistry with the wood worker character last season she kept fighting with, which could've been a fun story line to pursue. I thought we'd finally get a relationship that seemed more realistic and one I could actually root for. Then they got rid of that guy and now have brought in a woman for her to fall in love with. Why? The actress who plays Joy looks a little traumatized in those scenes, like she's afraid to blink for fear of not looking interested enough. It just doesn't make sense, doesn't seem authentic, and comes across as very forced. They could've introduced a new secondary character, if lgbtq was their goal, rather than make it Joy. Perhaps a Grey House guest, since apparently they don't seem to have guests anymore. Now, that isn't my only perceived flaw with this show. I am honestly so sick of Stephanie, she is so irritating and the actress can't flirt to save her life, let alone with a much younger guy. All the makeup in the world can't make her look the 10+ years younger they're aiming for this season. It's honestly just so cringe to watch. I am also entirely sick of the older cousin in this show, because the writers can't make up their minds about her. She finally seemed more likeable last season due to some growth. This season though she is back to seeming mentally unstable and I honestly wish the mayor guy marrying her would run away and find someone else. She might be a bunny boiler. She is also an incredibly boring character along with the new Joy, who seems to have lost her personality. Actually, where did these cousins even come from? I could've sworn Cassie made it clear that she had no family in the earlier films and seasons. This show is supposed to be about Cassie the Good Witch, and not the Good Witch's Cousins. Cassie is so boring now and doesn't seem like a main character anymore. Her marriage is so empty and comes across as mostly loveless, which is sad because there isn't an ounce of passion in it and I want Cassie to have a good relationship. Cassie is 40 something and supposed to have some Merrywick fire in her, not 80 something and settling for a comfortable companion to play checkers with. T
Her and her husband don't even seem very comfortable together half the time. The Grandpa character and Martha have a more passionate romance than her and her husband this season, even if those relationships are completely ridiculous and unrealistic. This show is just so bad now. This season, much like last season and partly the season before is so severely boring. I used to look forward to watching it and now I only watch it when I've exhausted all other options, and only because I feel like I've stuck with it this long and it feels like a commitment I have to keep. I honestly wish the show had ended a season or 2 ago, so I wouldn't feel like I have to watch it despite not liking it anymore. I honestly hope they end it this season. Between the lgbtq personality change for Joy, Stephanie pretending she's young, the Pastor becoming so lame and completely unappealing, I think it's time for me to let go of this show. The boredom while watching it was leading me there, but this season so far has been enough for me to find closure and stop watching for good.",/review/rw4379360/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have been binge watching this lovely series, having got so fed up with some of the very dark and dismal series I sometimes watch I decided to watch this, it is a lovely gentle nothing nasty happens series which makes a pleasant change, i love all the characters Martha is one of my favourites, only gripe if you can call it that is Sam constantly has his hands in his bloomin' pockets.",/review/rw4379360/?ref_=tt_urv

5 August 2018,kkincaid97,8," I'm a newcomer to the Good Witch universe
",I've been binge watching the entire series over the past few weeks and mostly enjoying it. It's nice for once to have some low-key (and completely family friendly) amusement. There's very little Drama and that's a hard thing to find these days. Recommended for light viewing.,/review/rw4379360/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2021,Melusina13,," What About Grace?
","I have enjoyed Good Witch over the years as a pleasant diversion. The scenery, decorations and subtle hint of the supernatural were easy to sit back and enjoy. A year ago I would have been upset to hear that the show was cancelled. However, after the train wreck that has been Season 7, I believe it's time to put this mess out of its misery. Others have commented on many of the problems with this season but there is one thing that I haven't seen mentioned and that is WHAT ABOUT GRACE? This confusing red moon thing is affecting all of the Merriwick women but Cassie hasn't even mentioned her own daughter. After the sometimes cloyingly close relationship that they had, she apparently prefers talking to her dead parents to checking on her living child. Apparently the writers thought that after including her earlier in the season, it was now OK to banish her to the zone of forgotten relatives (Jakes' kids, George's wife, etc.). It's time for this show to go!",/review/rw4379360/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2021,mish_mell,3," No longer ""family friendly"" entertainment.

4 April 2020,rvdwalle,7," Feel-good series w/o any major drama
","I enjoy watching this show as it makes me feel happy and really good when I am slightly down.
Everything is good in Middleton and you start wondering if such a magical place could really exist and why you don't move there right away. One thing I don't like abt the show is how important characters just disappear and are never heard of again. Makes this warm-hearted Middleton community look a tat superficial and I am left confused and disappointed.",/review/rw4379360/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2015,Ahlmanke,8," I really enjoy the show and would hate to see it go.
","I have read the reviews so far, and I disagree with most of them. I have been and always will be a fan of the movies, I loved every single one of them. I have been hoping that they would make it into a series and I am so glad that they have. I realize that many things have changed, but life changes so why shouldn't the stories change as well? I do wish that they could have dealt with Jake's death a little bit more, but, come on people, we all know it is a show and you can not force someone to do a series when they can't or won't so how could they have handled it better? Iam just glad that they were smart enough to not replace him with someone else, I think that would have been worse. ",/review/rw4379360/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am 55 year old Grandfather of 3. I would of never watched this show, but found it on Netflix and I was hooked. It is at its most basic a love story, and how life just happens the good the bad and the ugly. The title Good Witch has really nothing to do with witches, or magic for that matter. It's a show about life.",/review/rw4379360/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2019,cutetimster,10," I really love this show
","Wow ... I was reading some of the reviews of this show and they were so mean and like the authors of the reviews were either eating a lemon or they just ate one ...
A .. some of the reviews don't say they're going to have spoilers , which is pretty bad
B. Why do they watch it if they hate it so much .
So no spoilers here .. I am an Englishman of over 50 and I am sure I am not the target audience for his show .. but when I just finished watching the beginning episode of the new series of Luther in the UK .. blood and guts everywhere ( sorry if that was a spoiler ) but Luther always has blood and guts .. Something I noticed US Tv series seem to be scared of ..It was nice to get back to my cocy Middleton !!
Anyway I digress , The Good Witch is like drinking a warm and soothing cup of cocoa in front of a log fire with your feet up... No bullets no really bad baddies just good clean witcherey ... sneeky sidelong glances from the main character when she knew she was right all along .. love it !! Tim ...p.s . Happy New Year from here in Middleton ( where I'd love to live )",/review/rw4379360/?ref_=tt_urv

13 October 2021,tempestatiri,7," Tripped at the Finish Line- Last Season FAIL!!!!
","This show had it all. It was a 10/10. Good feels, people facing relevant challenges, and just a hint of mystique without being overpowering or political. While the enhanced supernatural flare up and main plot were great in the last season, the subplots went off the rails and NOT in a good way. They warped everyone in the season break. Cassie got some good plots and growth at least.",/review/rw4379360/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2021,azsprad,5," Lost interest.
","I liked this show and found it sweet and innocent. A nice show about nice people that may or may not have special powers. The shows episodes have lightweight mysteries, love stories, and simple problems to solve. I could really relax, watch and be transported to a magical town of fantasy where things are perfect and people are happy. Basically, escapism from the reality of issues in the country that are being force fed to us and our children in every other program and everywhere you turn, now days. I suppose the writers are running out of ideas. I see that this season 7 Hallmark is feeling the pressure to be edgy. Maybe it's possible I just lost interest in the show. Oh well, back to old movies.",/review/rw4379360/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2018,shfirefly,7," Has that Feel Good Factor
","In a cynical world, so often filled with doom and gloom, it makes such a pleasant change to find an upbeat program. With moral tales reminiscent of the Waltons, lashings of romance and a dash of humour; Good Witch is just such a program. One of the things I really like about the storyline is that doesn't rely on the hackneyed 'Will they won't they' cliche. However, I now hear that the plot is going to take a darker turn. I hope that doesn't mean, that Cassie and Sam's relationship ends - I'd stop watching!",/review/rw4379360/?ref_=tt_urv
