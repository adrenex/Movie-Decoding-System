2 September 2021,Tweekums,7," Decent little sci-fi
","In the early scenes of this sci-fi thriller we see protagonist Julia, a small time thief, gets taken from her home. When she wakes she is in a lab and has an implant in the back of her neck. After a painful procedure she is sent to a cell where she finds two others people in a similar predicament. An escape attempts leads to the destruction of the lab but not her freedom. Her captor, scientist Alex, intends to complete his experiments; this will require Julia to do various mental tasks under the supervision of TAU; the artificial intelligence that controls the house and its systems... which include a lethal robotic sentry. If Julia is to escape she will have to find a way to reason with TAU.",/review/rw4220323/?ref_=tt_urv

24 March 2019,SeriousMayhem,7," Not bad at all, not great either
","This movie isn't very original or groundbreaking, and it becomes a rather predictable ride about halfway through. But, if you can manage to suspend your disbelief just enough, that ride is still mostly entertaining.",/review/rw4220323/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2019,L_Copa,7," Wow, I really enjoyed watching this movie! almost atmospheric...
","Taus, scientists and girl's performance was good! Directing was good and was surrounded with mystery and various thoughts! It rolled like a thriller. An original one! It makes you think some things for our world... Don't miss it!",/review/rw4220323/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2020,lewisxx-417-226815,7," Not what you'd expect
","I was expecting more of a horror/thriller by the movie description, but this turns into a more developing AI movie on the backdrop of a thriller. By the end I was totally invested in the protagonist and the AIs relationship.",/review/rw4220323/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2018,ryansalamence,3," Tau does not compute
","Psychological thrillers centered around artificial intelligence are some of my favorite movies, the genre has so much potential to explore artificial minds, as well as terrify with their capabilities. In order to do so, they require very fleshed out and smart writing, when comparing the writing of this film, especially the writing of the A.I. to that of films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Her, and Ex machina, the writing falls very short. It has a very difficult time fleshing out the protagonists relationship with the A.I., leading to many scenes that feel undeserved and forced. They wanted emotional scenes, but they didn't earn them. This on top of very mediocre performances, and character decisions that don't seem near as reasonable as some other choices they could have made. There were also a few things that weren't logical from any standpoint, but I'm willing to suspend that disbelief. I very much enjoyed the set itself, it did a good job selling itself as a futuristic film, and also made for some very pretty cinematography, using different colored lights and displays to illuminate some shots and scenes. Altogether, I liked the concept, disliked the execution.",/review/rw4220323/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2020,holyraine,7," definetely not perfect, but it has its strong points
","Ok so full disclosure, ill admit this movie isnt perfect. but the thing i like about it was the fact that instead of being another cookie-cutter ""A.I. is evil"" sci-fi movie, the movie actually had a positive view of the A.I. and didnt label it as the bad guy. and that i think is worth some points. i probably wont be watching this again anytime soon, but i would still say this is worth a watch.
salso the CGI was pretty impressive (even if it was used sparingly)",/review/rw4220323/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2018,Councillor3004,," A very forgettable addition to the artificial intelligence film genre
","After her successful roles in modern cult films ""The Guest"" and ""It Follows"", Maika Monroe has established herself as a scream queen, a position which should only be further manifested by ""Tau"", an artificial intelligence thriller which suffers from not being able to make use of a mildly interesting premise. In terms of cinematography and style, ""Tau"" is good enough, not outstanding, but it's certainly watchable. However, it's the nonexistence of any interesting aspects in its script which really brings this down - everything is always only hinted at, never fully explored, not to mention that most of its ideas aren't entirely original either. Maika Monroe gives a decent performance and I enjoyed Gary Oldman's voice role (even though I can't really understand how he went from winning an Oscar for his incredible portrayal of Winston Churchill to grabbing some cash with this), while Ed Skrein's acting didn't catch my attention at all. To sum things up, ""Tau"" does not have the most original premise and doesn't follow up on it with an interesting plot, instead creating something surprisingly boring and dull. Just like many other Netflix sci-fi movies, I cannot recommend watching it.",/review/rw4220323/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2018,Leofwine_draca,5," Not bad, but could have been better
","TAU is another Netflix-made movie and a mix of the science fiction and thriller genres. After an arresting, hair-raising opening sequence the action is centred in a high-tech, artily-lit house which is inhabited by a crazy inventor, a trapped heroine, and a cool-looking robot. The whole story then plays out between these three characters. Inevitably the story is rather cliched and feels weak and comic book-style in comparison to similar pieces like DEMON SEED, although it did remind me more of SATURN 3. Gary Oldman is fun as the voice of the computer but too often the script reduces him to lines which sound straight out of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. The human cast members fare less well, with Maika Monroe merely repeating her emperilled schtick from IT FOLLOWS and Ed Skrein having little to work with. Still, the film looks nice, it has a fast pace and plenty of incident, so it's not all bad.",/review/rw4220323/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2018,Platypuschow,6," Tau: Passable slice of scifi
","Reading the synopsis of Tau I expected a movie like Cube, Saw, The Breathing Room, Circle etc. Namely a movie where people are taken against there will and forced to play a game of death. I love movies like that!",/review/rw4220323/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2018,ornellaboasso22,4," I know we're supposed to suspend disbelief but...
","I wanted to love this movie but the script (and specially Ed Skrein's character) is so flawed that I just couldn't.
During the first half of the movie, he is shown meticulously arranging his torture tools, in the next scene, we see Julia steals one of them, and we are left to believe he just didn't notice?. Then while he's gone and mayhem ensues, he finds out about this only upon returning to his house? I mean the guy is literally kidnapping people and torturing them, and we're supposed to believe that he wouldn't program TAU to let him know if something weird happens, let alone if there is a freaking explosion?
And as if THAT was not enough, he then proceeds to let this girl that almost destroyed his whole house to just live in there, he buys her clothes and feeds her like some kind of futuristic Belle and the Beast and casually mentions to her that the IA controlling the house sometimes ""reacts erratically""...
Anyway, the acting is fine, the visuals are beautiful, I love the genre and think the idea could have been great but the script is just not up to the task.",/review/rw4220323/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2019,tesswysko,9," An AI Movie With the Biggest Heart I've EVER Seen!
","I'm a HUGE fan of Sci-fi, John Varley, Isaac Asimov, etc. and there's a simple set of rules for robots and AI. (If you don't know, I recommend looking it up before watching. ) I seldom find a movie that makes me think, or has the GUTS to bend or break the rules AND is ABLE to FOLLOW THROUGH with their decision without making a flop!",/review/rw4220323/?ref_=tt_urv

She wakes up in a concrete basement cell with 2 other people. They are all wearing some mouth covering for some reason.

29 June 2018,neener3707,4," Some Neat Ideas - But Falls Flat
","Many films like 2001: A Space Odyssey come to mind when viewing this film, but unlike those film, none of it is effective or interesting, I actually had to force myself to finish it because I was so disinterested. The idea is fine enough, especially with the advent of smart technology homes, but unfortunately it is juts not effective compared to predecessors like 2001 and certain episodes of the X-Files. The artificial intelligent being is just plain old not scary or intimidating like HAL-3000, not sure whether it was the silly voice or the way its presented, but I simply did not feel any tension. While I like some of the kills/gore, which is the reason I gave it more that 2 stars, not much else was interesting or effective. I really had many hopes for this film, but the were all quickly squashed by sub-par film making.",/review/rw4220323/?ref_=tt_urv

14 April 2019,Henry-klein,6," Solid AI effort
",I would actually give this a 6.5 and encourage AI fans to watch. It could have been much better without the cheesy killer robot and plot holes with a villain who is detached from his hostage... if you are going to spend this much on a science-fi production think through the plot and details.,/review/rw4220323/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2018,milinskis,4," If you crave sci-fi, AI you may find it passable
","This movie is for passing time, turn it on and browse on your phone. But when you start to pay attention, some of the details, character decisions and dialogues seem cringy and also not much action here, motives not convincing, cheesy turn of events. Infinity chamber also explored similar topic and it is far superior in my opinion. I can give 4 stars to encourage exploration of such topic in movies, but something in this is lacking. it's close but sorry i just can't call it decent.",/review/rw4220323/?ref_=tt_urv

7 July 2018,Wizard-8,6," Watchabe, but could have been a lot better
","""Tau"" seems to have gotten a lot of inspiration from parts of other science fiction movies, such as ""Demon Seed"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". But complete originality is hard to find these days, and I personally did not mind the echoes of other movies as long as the rehash was entertaining. Well, I was never bored by the movie, there are some good sets and special effects, and the performances are fine. But the movie is held back from its potential impact by some significant flaws. For one thing, I think the movie is too long for its own good. Once you get the clues as to where the movie is inevitably heading to, the story starts to feel padded out, with scenes that really don't add anything. This leads to a second big problem, the ending - it feels somewhat unfinished and not completely satisfying. Had the movie been cut down by about fifteen to twenty minutes, or had that footage contained more plot and surprises that would lead to an ending with more bite, I think we would have had a better movie. As it is, it's not the worst Netflix exclusive movie I've seen, but I've seen better on that service.",/review/rw4220323/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2018,ScoobySnacks66,2," Netflix might need to change their name to Dumpflix

5 April 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,8," Ignore the bad reviews.

21 July 2019,naum-rusomarov-944-460795,7," perfectly fine Sunday evening movie
","There is nothing special about this movie, everything that happens in it has been done in other movies, sometimes better sometimes worse. Despite this, it's not a terribly bad movie. It's fine. It's perfectly watchable. It's entertaining and the main character is quite good in the role of the protagonist, the voice of the AI is also great and I think its character was well developed through the film. Mr. Evil Guy as always wasn't really fleshed out at all, they could have used a carton cutout and it won't have made a difference in the film. There are also some problems with CGI here and there, but that does not dectract from the viewing experience.",/review/rw4220323/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2018,gminetos-38105,2," Did not execute on its fabulous potential.
","Here was my rating history every half hour: 9 -> 6 -> 2. Yes, it rapidly deteriorated from a promising start. It's got good production values and the relatively unknown principals added realism. However, I found myself siding with the antagonist as the film progressed, I just wanted Julia to meet her end. And if anyone but me watched the final 10 minutes then you realize the stunningly stupid ending cannot possibly result in a rating better than 4! So disappointed at what could've been.",/review/rw4220323/?ref_=tt_urv
