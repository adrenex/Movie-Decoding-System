23 July 2000,BaronBl00d,," Great Adventurous Fun!
","Certainly this Universal remake is more in the vain of Indiana Jones rather than the original Mummy.  It is high on adventure and comedy, and wins because of it.  The sets, scenery, special effects are all first-rate.  The film is fast-paced from beginning to end and is very suspenseful.  Stephen Sommers again shows his talent as a director for creating action-packed adventure with a high level of comedic overtones.  The cast are all very good in their roles, yet none of them seem really to be taking themselves or the film too serious.  Brendan Fraser is an affable hero, and Rachel Weisz makes a good heroine.  Good support comes from John Hannah, Kevin J. O'Connor, and the mummy, Arnold Vosloo.  Also a real treat was seeing Bernard Fox in a small role as an aging British pilot.  Don't expect the old mummy of lore in this one, but sit down and have one heck of a ride...a rollercoaster of hijinks in the sands of Egypt.",/review/rw2585050/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2003,MovieAddict2016,8," Great fun in the vein of ""Indiana Jones""...
","""The Mummy"" is an adventurous yarn in the vein of ""Indiana Jones."" It's a lot of fun, very charming, and never tries to be more than what it is. What is it? An entertaining summer flick which is not only worth seeing, but perhaps even owning. It's one of those fun movies you can return to over and over again and never grow tired of doing so.",/review/rw2585050/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," ""We are in some serious trouble""
","In the 1990's, a stream of remakes came out after the universal horror films with the monsters: Dracula(Bram Stoker's Dracula), Frankenstein(Mary Shelley's Frankenstein), The Wolf Man(Wolf) and now The Mummy made after the same title. The original stared Boris Karloff and is truly a haunting movie. Despite the fact that slow moving mummies are not as scary of a villain, Boris brought in an incredible eerie performance that is so memorable that made mummies scary. How could we update the story to make mummies more terrifying to a newer audience? Make them faster? Make them smarter? How much they could control? How dangerous they truly are? They put a bunch of CGI into the film but somehow despite it being over the top at times, the story is what makes The Mummy into a great remake and respects the original making the mummy scary again.",/review/rw2585050/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 1999,bjones,9," Fun adventure film
","Here, the makers took the original stock horror film and turned it into an Indianajonesesque adventure in the tradition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The most visually rich part of the film was the opening scenes set in ancient Egypt. I would love to see an entire film built around that. The sets and costumes were brilliant.",/review/rw2585050/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2006,ccthemovieman-1,8," Bit Overlong, But Still The Word Is 'Fun'
","It seems like a long time ago when this came out, but I remember it being the first DVD I had ever bought sight unseen, meaning I had never seen the film in the theater. I was pleased. I got what I had hoped for: a fun, special-effects extravaganza. ",/review/rw2585050/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2008,ricsim78,10," One of my all time favorite movies
","First off, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but most of the low ratings I am seeing are criticizing ""The Mummy"" because of it's ""weak plot"" or someone even said that this movie could have been written by the person's dog!",/review/rw2585050/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2006,Flagrant-Baronessa,8," A poor man's Indiana Jones - but still endlessly entertaining
","The Mummy is a great summer adventure for nonstop thrills and kicks. It has a lot of humour; memorable comedic performances (Brendan Fraser), fantastic settings and surprisingly striking CGI for 1999. There is little technically wrong with this film other than that is clearly borrows heavily from the King of action-adventure, Indiana Jones.",/review/rw2585050/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2010,neil-476,9," First rate romp
","To remake The Mummy in the style of Indiana Jones but with a humorous edge was a stroke of genius, and it is executed very well in this movie.",/review/rw2585050/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," I love this movie so much!
",A real romp of an adventure/horror genre with a wonderful aesthetic that works perfectly and he period setting is pure genius at creating an immersive world. Performances are terrific with Weisz and Fraser having a blast and a great dynamic. The CGI does look a little outdated and of course brings the overall film down but the humour and the overall tone is balanced brilliantly.,/review/rw2585050/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2002,SmileysWorld,8," Great fun!
","Brendan Fraser may well have established himself as the John Wayne of his day with his thrilling performance here.No one can take the place of the Duke of course,but Fraser approached his character with just the right amount of swagger,wit,and charm.This take on an often told story has all the charm of the old Saturday matinee's of years gone by,and all the thrills of the Raiders of the Lost Ark series.Excellent casting,with standout performances from everyone, particularly Arnold Vosloo,Fraser,and Oded Fehr.Highly recommended.",/review/rw2585050/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2017,Fella_shibby,8," Solid entertainment. The remake starring Cruise is so bad....
","I first saw this in a theater in 1999. Revisted it recently with my kids on a DVD. I am writing the review of this as i was totally upset by the boring n lame Tom cruise's remake. Many compared this film to Indiana Jones n other treasure hunt films. Whatever the similarities, this film is pure fun. It is one of the best movies -- in terms of sheer entertainment. The pacing is good n the visuals top notch considering the era. It has monsters, thrills, humor and daring close calls. The opening sequences of Ancient Egypt are breathtaking as are the shots of new century Cairo. The special effects has fast paced skeletons, sandstorms, beetle hordes, fiery hail bombardments and hungry locusts/tiny monsters. Ther is little to think but plenty to enjoy in this movie. Director Sommer filmed the action in carefully composed widescreen shots, where it's always perfectly clear what's going on. If you're looking for some mindless fun with zero story, romance, good effects n monster fun then you'll probably like this film. The sequel was a decent film. The third starring Jet Li was a total letdown.",/review/rw2585050/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2015,bowmanblue,8," Fun, fun, fun
","Okay, before I begin the review proper, I must warn you that I'm probably going to be using the word 'fun' a lot to describe 'The Mummy.' Because that's all it is â€“ fun. A lot of people liken it to the Indiana Jones movies and I can see where they're coming from. Then again, an equally high proportion of the audience detests how the two movies are likened to each other. No, I'm certainly not saying that The Mummy is anywhere near as good as the Jones trilogy (notice how I'm leaving out the Crystal Skull out of that statement!), but it is similar.",/review/rw2585050/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2001,Movie Nuttball,10," This is one heck of a Mummy movie
","The title speaks for itself.This is arguably the greatest mummy movie ever made(well next to The Mummy Returns).You ask why is this the best one?Its the best one because it has a great story,good acting,beautiful sites at how it really was in acient egypt and some of the greatest visual effects ever seen by the human eye!Everything in The Mummy is fantastic!",/review/rw2585050/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2011,hitchcockthelegend,8," It's not horror you know - it's just real good family fun.
","The Mummy is directed by Stephen Sommers, who also co-writes the screenplay with John L. Balderston. It stars Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo & Kevin J. O'Connor. Jerry Goldsmith scores the music and cinematography is by Adrian Biddle. Plot sees Fraser as ex-Foreign Legionnaire adventurer Rick O'Connell, who teams up with Egyptologist Evelyn Carnahan (Weisz) and her cowardly brother Jonathan (Hannah), to try and stave off the apocalypse born out of the unleashing of the mummified remains of High Priest Imhotep (Vosloo).",/review/rw2585050/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2012,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,10," My Favorite Fraser Franchise
","Director Stephen Sommers' version of the horror classic, The Mummy (1932), has been one of Universal's most successful franchises. It's also because of this that got Stephen Sommers famous. It also made a slew of other celebrities famous as well. And although it does not play like an Indiana Jones film, it pays homage to archaeologists and the magic within old architecture. Not mention this film made two more sequels.",/review/rw2585050/?ref_=tt_urv

6 May 2007,Boba_Fett1138,7," Good simple entertainment.
","At the time of its release, both the public and critics were screaming and shouting that this movie for being to much of an Indiana Jones wannabe. Now that this storm has settled down, I hope that more people will be able to take this movie for what it is; pure simple entertainment.",/review/rw2585050/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 1999,catmommie,8," Silly Fun
","Citizen Kane it ain't, but if you're looking for good, silly, H. Rider Haggardesque fun, this is the film for you.  While it  hasn't replaced the Universal classic in my affections, let's face it, the venerable original creaks a little.  I mean,  Karloff's Imhotep only moves two feet per hour -- geez, how will I ever escape him?  Arnold Vosloo's Mummy is considerably more fleet, and frankly (from the dirty old lady's perspective) is pretty darned buff for a dead guy.  A modern affectation, sure, but I like the idea of a mummy with a great butt.",/review/rw2585050/?ref_=tt_urv

23 April 2002,Big Movie Fan,," EXCITEMENT GALORE!

8 September 2009,TheLittleSongbird,7," Very likable horror adventure.
","The Mummy is a fun and likable horror adventure, that doesn't take itself too seriously. True, there are a few discrepancies in the script, it is a tad overlong and Kevin J.Connor's Beni mayn't be to everyone's tastes, but it is a solid film of its genre. The visuals are absolutely stunning, every scene with the Egyptian desert is enough to take your breath away, and the costumes are very nice too. The music by the one and only Jerry Goldsmith is a very creepy and atmospheric score, and just goes to show what a talented composer Goldsmith was. I will admit some of it is quite scary, and that is an understatement, I do confess being scared of the film when I saw it for the first time when I was 9(I'm 17 now), and there are some scenes that still scare me now. It is no wonder because Arnold Vosloo's Imhotep was a masterstroke, very, very frightening at times, especially when the Mummy disguises himself on the ship, and takes off his cloak to claim his first victim. The other performances are fine, with a dashing Brendan Fraser and a stunningly beautiful Rschel Weisz. John Hannah, if you forgive his accent, was on the whole fine. Overall, a fun and likable horror adventure, flawed yes, but guaranteed to give you entertainment and perhaps nightmares. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2585050/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2012,ochenko-teresa,9," Awesome roller coaster adventure!
","I will have to say that ""Mummy"" was an action adventure film in the spirit of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". I know there have been other attempts over the years, but ""The Mummy"" comes the closest to hitting the mark.",/review/rw2585050/?ref_=tt_urv
