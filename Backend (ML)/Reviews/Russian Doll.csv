",So Heartbeat is to leave us after so many years of memorable moments. Some will say it should have gone years ago but for millions it is as much of the furniture as the Sunday roast.,/review/rw6740664/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2004,penseur,," Enjoyable English 1960s nostalgia
","This TV series manages to combine all the elements that make for a pleasant and at times absorbing hour in front of the TV - good varied characters, a range of occupations, although of course the policemen dominate, creative and simultaneously plausible story lines - usually one serious criminal occurrence and one lighthearted theme per episode - and all of it set in rural English village landscape (Yorkshire) which looks very nice and a contrast from urban Britain which I find mostly quite dreary and depressing. The 1960s seem a long time ago now, before Britain joined the EEC, when it still used non-decimal currency and imperial measurements, when it was still largely ""monocultural"", and when there were still steam trains. There are also those dinky British 60s cars, motorbikes and trucks that everyone gets around in, miniskirts and pop hits of the time on the soundtrack. What more could you ask for? Another commentator says it screens in the UK on Sunday nights - here it has always screened early on Saturday afternoons which isn't exactly prime time, a pity.",/review/rw6740664/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2003,richteabiscuit,," Fun program
","""Heartbeat"" is a brilliant nostalgic feel-good drama set in the 1960's. It mixes gentle story lines, beautiful scenery and hit music from the period to create a madly watchable program.  Sure it is not ground breaking and certainly would not win any awards for creativity but it provides the perfect form of entertainment for a Sunday night.  The light and easy to digest stories are just what anyone would want the night before an early morning start for work.  What makes ""Heartbeat"" so good is the likeable characters and combination of humour and action.  It doesn't take itself too seriously and never fails to have at least one scene were you couldn't fail to laugh or raise a smile.  Even though it is on 24 times a year it hasn't deteriorated into just another soap like ""The Bill"" or ""Where the heart is"" with episodes made up of mainly stand-alone parts.  It is deservedly the #1 drama on UK TV with 10 million viewers and even had a spin-off made in 2003 called ""The Royle"".",/review/rw6740664/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2003,joeagnes,," gives those that were too young to remember the sixties a second chance
","If you were a young child living in England during any period of the 1960's, then this show is for you.  If you miss the sixties, the live sounds of The Beatles, Donovan, Dusty Springfield together with many cult bands in those times of magic when we felt like as if life took you beyond your dreams, then this television series will help you reminisce and relate to such times more than any other television show ( to my knowledge) that is set in that era which contains the British atmosphere.  The plot and theme enriches much of the simple life of a Beautiful English country town somewhere in Yorke, initially focusing around the interaction of a local Bobby - Nick Rowan ( played by Nick Berry) with the characters that make up the village community.  Nearly all of the characters play a unique and important role, creating a new and interesting episode which leads the viewer enticed to want more.  The episodes are beautifully supported by background music made popular by artists of that era and sometimes earlier (as the title tune `Heartbeat' was made famous by Buddy Holly in the late fifties) all depending on the scenes, bringing the sixties as alive as possible.",/review/rw6740664/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2011,barbapapa-2,10," I can't stop watching this!
","I can't believe I just heard about this show (right after it got cancelled!). It's the perfect show to just put on and relax - it's entertaining, light (with some exceptions, such as the episode in season 16 or 17 which includes a few moments of domestic violence), funny, and has a cast full of great characters.",/review/rw6740664/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2005,Sulla-2,," A comfortable drama for a Sunday evening.
","I have enjoyed Heartbeat since it was first screened 13 years ago, and it is still set in the 60's !! Most of the outdoor scenes are filmed in the small village of Goatland which is renamed Aidensfield. I Have been in the pub, the shops, the garage and on the train on a day trip!! The main police station is set in the nearest small town, the name of which slips my mind at the moment. Some scenes are set in the real seaside town of Whitby. Almost all of the cast have changed. I used to like Greengrass but is successors have been a bit too pushy for my liking. One strange thing is that when Alf Ventress was in uniform , he had no medals on his jackets even though one episode was all about his war service in the marines.",/review/rw6740664/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2008,ladybug_16,8," GoodSunday evening entertainment!
","This is my very first comment on IMDb...and I think Heartbeat deserves the honour! I've watched Heartbeat on and off for many years now. Mind you, I'm only in my 20s, and most viewers that I know tend to be older than me so it was nice to see younger people posting on the boards. While Heartbeat could have easily lost viewers on a number of occasions, particularly with the loss of favourites, such as Phil Bellamy, it's still going strong. This is due, I think, to a constant stream of good characters, including many decent guest appearances. Although the plots can be a tad predictable (don't we know that the motor-bike riding policeman is bound to fall in love with the local doctor?!), this familiarity, as others have pointed out, add to the appeal. You sit down to watch Heartbeat and while there are certain things you can expect from it, it never disappoints. I prefer it to other British soaps as it has a certain innocence in comparison to the loudmouth filled casts of Eastenders or Coronation Street, and the '60s music, style and way of life is just charming.",/review/rw6740664/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2005,walfordqueen,," A good show
",I've been watching Heartbeat for the past 7 years and have to say that it's a very gentle show. The show did suffer after losing the character of Greengrass but I like the way that things have picked up after a brief boring period. The character of Peggy is a bit tiresome but you can cope with her if you ignore the fact that she's supposed to be their latest replacement for Greengrass. I don't know how long this show can still continue to be set in the 60s for though when you consider the fact that soon the cast will begin to look much older than they were ten years ago. Overall it combines some great sounds of the sixties with some entertaining stories about crime.,/review/rw6740664/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2006,pethoc,10," A familiar, lovable favourite
","""Heartbeat"" is often criticized for its highly formulaic presentation and the fact that the makers no longer work to the realistic 1960s time-line. I can understand those concerns with the show, rolling my eyes at the fact that the show was first set in 1964 and has now been going about 14 years.",/review/rw6740664/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2004,matthew-58,," Used to be good but lost its way
","Heartbeat began with former EastEnders star (and wooden as my front door) Nick Berry as a London police constable who relocated to the North Yorkshire Moors in the 1960s.  Based on Nicholas Rhea's real experiences of police life during that era, it was a worthy and authentic series that set out to address some of the pertinent issues of the time.  Nick Berry's severe limitations when it came to expressing anything were compensated by the fantastic character performances of Derek Fowlds as tyrannical Sergeant Blaketon, William Simons as lazy, ageing Constable Ventress and Bill Maynard as local rogue Greengrass.

4 November 2003,rossrobinson,10," fantastic
",Heartbeat is a great series. This all started in 1992 and is set in a place i have been before 'Whitby'. It is a fantastic place to visit in the North Yorkshire area. The actors and actresses that star in Heartbeat are fantastic. I give the series 10 out of 10.,/review/rw6740664/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2000,Castor-11,," As watchable as ""Coronation St""
","If you like Brit drama/comedy(or even if you don't, particularly) then you'll go for this ongoing prime-time soap opera set in an English country village - unlike the ""Street"" the accents render the dialogue comprehensible, so I cannot tell you the location.",/review/rw6740664/?ref_=tt_urv

26 April 2022,mjanssens26,9," Like going back to the 60's in a time machine
","I was a 1980's-90's kid but for some reason, I discovered this gem of a show streaming on Tubi in 2022. It only has six seasons on Tubi (even though the show ran for 18 years) but this show is like a comforting old blanket and cup of tea. It's a program that takes place in small town 1960's England and all the characters are wonderful and colorful. If you're going through a tough time in life, I suggest watching Heartbeat. It's like being in the company of a warm friend. Hopefully Tubi will stream Heartbeat's other seasons soon.",/review/rw6740664/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2005,palexandersquires,," Heart beat New Sergent, New broom sweeps clean!
","There is a new Sergeant in Adensfeild, and he is a strict man! he is played by John Duttine of my previous Review! he came into the peaceful Police Station, and what is the first thing that he does? he does not say Hi, I am your new Sergeant, if you have any problems you know where my door is"" No, he makes more problems for the policemen at Adensfeild, by threatening to close the Police house. and he did not approve of the tip off to Robert Walker ,P.C.Walker to you and me, about a robbery that was going to take place at that stately home. It is always the same when you get a new boss, (He/She) does things differently to the previous boss. I wonder how Merton would of handled that tip off? John Duttine is still a brilliant actor after all this time, since 1981! People power showed Sgt miller that they were not going to let him close the police house. I remembered the Ford Zeypher 6 police car from when I was a child and I laughed out loud at the condition it was at the end of the trail period. it was not the gleaming prize car but a wrecked one! and the chief constable was looking on at it!!! there was a good technical description of the car's engine by the beautiful Rose, that mechanic a V6 twin carburettor engine under that bonnet. this gives the car a very fast 100 M.P.H. speed if it is needed. I like Gina in the Adensfeild arms pub and Oscar Blaketon it was a shame that he had to retire from being a Sergent due to a heart attack if viewers remember. I also think that Ventress is a good civilian to have in the Police station he did not do much work when he was a copper, but he is making up for it now, by answering the phones. I also can see my Bush radio in the police house! the old VTR 130! mine is the tr82/97.and is a reproduction and is available at Index for £25! I also like the music on this programme. it shows us the golden age, when people respected each other more those days, and life was at a slower pace then. None of this rushing about, trying to get things done! If I had a time machine, I would go to 1960, up to 1969 and stop there.",/review/rw6740664/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2021,Littlelep,," Enjoy Most of the Cast, but ONE!
","I just became aware of this series, when I found it on Britbox US. The settings are beautiful and the writing is quite good. The casting of the ""Baddies"" did not go overboard and make them unwatchable, as in some of the British series I have tried to watch.",/review/rw6740664/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2009,jubilee77,," The end is nigh and I wouldn't be so surprised
","By the time I issued these comments, it had been announced that the popular series would gather dust on a shelf and so the end is nigh and I wouldn't be all that surprised. In part, the decision to axe the series was made due to its sinking popularity and much had been said about Heartbeat throughout its production run spanning 1.5 decades that I have long thought to myself ""How much longer can it linger""? With the same plots, it has to be said that most viewers around the box were becoming increasingly tired and frustrated and its now simply lacking the original on what was once a more gentle-natured series. Even so, its becoming increasingly violent and depressing with lack of ideas and bad story lines. Even Lovejoy's Ian McShane once commented about Heartbeat being a soap and who would try to get him wrong nowadays with its gradual fall from grace in the TV guides and critics choice.",/review/rw6740664/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2016,emmasharris,8," I wish it was still running
",I love this series. Nick berry was brilliant in this series it was a pity he left in series 7. The theme song was so catchy. I didn't like Niamh Cusack I found her a pain in the neck. It was a horrible way of killing her off. Nick's new wife Jo was such a pain in the neck. Never understanding a thing. God I don't know why he even married her. Derek Flowds should cool off when he retires from been a sergeant . Mike who took over from Nick seemed nice enough however I find all the things that happen in HeartBeat there is never a new plot. Okay I love the TV series and the theme tune but really why make the police officers look so dumb it is not right.,/review/rw6740664/?ref_=tt_urv

19 September 2006,hillsbluesboy,," An enjoyable light entertainment show
","Set during the mid to late 1960's in the fictional villages of Ashfordly and Adensfield, somewhere near the real town of Whitby in North Yorkshire, Heartbeat is an entertaining light drama focusing on the lives of the local police officers and the local villagers. The local police constable is, depending on the series and actors involved, married to or dating the local doctor and many episodes combine police and medical drama. Light comedic relief is provided by the antics and moneymaking schemes of the local scallywag, Claude Greengrass in earlier series and later by the character, Vernon Scripps.",/review/rw6740664/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2021,tcecoleshaw,5," Nostalgic but doesn't justify its 60s setting
","I don't rate Heartbeat especially. It's yet one more TV series exploiting the songs of the sixties but for the most part, it Could have been set in any period. It doesn't know what it is either. Is it a police drama? Medical drama? Social drama? Seeing as it's light entertainment, it masters none and doesn't appear to explore serious era-specific issues. You might as well be watching Doc Martin. It does however enjoy high quality actors, decent writing, watchable stories (despite my criticisms), pleasant locations. For something a little more authentic and focused, try All Creatures Great and Small with it's slightly more memorable cast.",/review/rw6740664/?ref_=tt_urv
