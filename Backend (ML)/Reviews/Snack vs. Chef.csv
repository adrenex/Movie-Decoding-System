29 November 2009,MrRowBot,," Incredible footage that will amaze you more than Planet Earth.
","Words cannot describe how amazing this documentary is. Watching the series, you will continuously wonder how the camera crew was able to film the events and in such high definition.",/review/rw4565779/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2009,broomerang,10," An excellent documentary showing us nature in its glory...
","This has to be one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. The cinematography is amazing, the narrator has everything down perfectly, and the wildlife they show throughout the series is very interesting and colorful. The film crew travels all over the globe to capture nature's greatest moments, and they pull this off with ease.",/review/rw4565779/?ref_=tt_urv

","After the tremendous success of the extraordinary and revolutionary nature documentary series Planet Earth, a similar programme was bound to follow, and indeed it did. Narrated by Sir David Attenborough, this series uses the same special camera normally in the film industry to slow down the quickest action and get close to it. The programme sees how the animals and creatures of all parts of the world manage to survive, looking at what they eat, giving birth, fighting, looking after each other and much more. Throughout the programme we see reptiles and amphibians, mammals, fish, birds, insects, hunters and hunted, creatures of the deep, plants and primates. It was interesting to see the familiar animals and creatures you have seen many times in other programmes, but also the ones you have probably never seen. Filled with colourful worlds, magnificent living things and hearing the wonderful narration by Attenborough makes this just as brilliant as its predecessor, a must see. It won the Emmy for Outstanding Cinematography for Nonfiction Programming ""cinematography team"", and it was nominated for Outstanding Picture Editing for Nonfiction Programming, Outstanding Sound Editing for Nonfiction Programming (Single or Multi-Camera), Outstanding Sound Mixing for Nonfiction Programming and Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming. Very good!",/review/rw4565779/?ref_=tt_urv

","Despite how much he apparently dislikes the term ""national treasure"", that term really does sum up David Attenborough to a tee. He is such a great presenter (in his 90s and still sounds, and looks on a side note, great) and whenever a new series of his is aired they are often among the best the BBC has done in years.",/review/rw4565779/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2010,whynot2,9," Absolutely Amazing, But Not Perfect
","I certainly take no issue with the overwhelming positive reviews that preceded mine: the series provided amazingly photographed and dramatically presented insight into the diversity of life on the planet. We watched the entire series, and wish we had kept track of the number of times that we said ""Oh. My. God."" or ""That is so bizarre..."" Very much like ""Planet Earth"", ""Life"" demands a renewed sense of wonder of all that surrounds us.",/review/rw4565779/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2014,roedyg,9," Attenborough for Children
","I was expecting this film to have a creationist slant, but it does not. It is a bit like David Attenborough for children. It has first class nature photography, but it is aimed at children with a dumbed-down narration by Oprah Winfrey and somewhat Disneyfied music. It sometimes has an odd prudishness about fish reproduction.",/review/rw4565779/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2016,mymtproject,10," A fascinating look at the wide range of lifeforms on Earth
","I love the BBC's nature documentaries. They are some of the best in terms of photography and detail. LIFE is a favorites among them and David Attenborough again does a stellar job of narrating, providing hitherto unknown facts about life in all it's various niches. The chapters on Plants and Insects were best ones. I never knew how extensive and diverse these life forms are and all the environments they occupy. Simply amazing! This is a good educational series for children as well as adults. There is so much to learn about how nature works. The more we know, the more appreciative we become of our unique blue dot in space.",/review/rw4565779/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2019,Sylviastel,10," Let The Earth Fascinate You!
","I found this DVD with Oprah Winfrey as the American narrator while Sir David Attenborough narrated the British version. Still the ten hours just flew by in watching all of the ten episodes. Each episode has a subject about nature like plants; the hunted and the hunter; underwater; mammals; fish and more. If you want a natural documentary about life and nature, this one was done beautifully. I still feel bad about the cow though being eaten alive by the Kimodo dragons. That was hard to watch.",/review/rw4565779/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2021,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,10," Very Good
","This is one of the best documentaries I've ever watched. In fact, according to today's technology, it is old but very beautiful.",/review/rw4565779/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2021,tinytots2,9," A captivating depiction of life's varied adaptations
","Another gorgeous and illuminating nature documentary to add to the list, Life focusses on the anatomical, behavioural and tactical adaptations that lifeforms have devised to survive and thrive. Instead of a geographical basis, the series is divided up into ten episodes that each focusses on a separate class such as fish, birds, mammals and so on. This choice of episodic organization throws light on the commonalities between members of these classes while also highlighting the diversity that exists within them. There is also an episode centred on plants, an uncommon subject of nature documentaries, and another shining a spotlight on predator-prey interactions.",/review/rw4565779/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2018,gnid69,5," Great document, amazing narration, but IMO too much loud, cheesy music and censor.
","Amazing shots and facts, David is great narrator, but I found loud cheesy music very annoying at times and distracting me often, and along with too few killing censored, it sometimes felt like show for ADD kids. I think shows like this don't need that much music, if any, and should show more actual gore and violence to make people realize that it really happens in nature, so some ignorant idiots open their minds.
Otherwise amazing.",/review/rw4565779/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2018,leaferrer,6," Good documentary
","Great documentary. I cannot say anything negative of this, it was simply amazing",/review/rw4565779/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2019,meatman1476,5," Good, however a few problems.
",Overall good but far from great. My biggest issues were varied starting with most of this has been filmed and covered by bbc in past nature docs. My second issue was with Oprahs narrating. It was almost robotic with rarely any excitement on her part. Very unlike Attenborough who nails it every time and is very emotive. A big thing that took me right out of the doc was watching on BluRay the cuts to the commercial breaks were very very obvious. It's something I've never noticed in any of their nature docs and I've seen most repeatedly. Last complaint was a lack predation and a definite lack of showing the gore.,/review/rw4565779/?ref_=tt_urv
