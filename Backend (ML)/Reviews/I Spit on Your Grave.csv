2 March 2021,Xstal,8," Guilty Until Proven Innocent...
","... but even then you're still guilty, because somebody has to pay, so it might as well be you! If it wasn't for people like Nancy Hollander we wouldn't have the outstanding Tahar Rahim to thank for portraying, through an award worthy performance, the unbelievable injustices endured by Mohamedou Ould Slahi. Unlocking some of the not so secret secrets behind the incarceration of the innocent, the torture and torment of the unfortunate, the proximity in time and space to a place you probably call home reinforcing the impact of lessons seldom learnt and the overwhelming ignorance of those entrusted to protect us when given carte blanche to do so.",/review/rw6634405/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2021,Gordon-11,," My heart is very heavy
","This is a very very powerful film, that brings a very dark page of history to light. My heart is so heavy from the horror I saw. When the credits rolled, I didn't want to stop the film. I'm amazed by how he keeps his positivity, or even the will to live through years of darkness.",/review/rw6634405/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2021,SnoopyStyle,8," powerful straight story
","Mohamedou Ould Slahi (Tahar Rahim) gets picked up by the Mauritanian police after 9/11. It's the start of his odyssey to Guantánamo Bay. Three years later, New Mexico defense attorney Nancy Hollander (Jodie Foster) gets recruited to be his lawyer. She is joined by junior associate Teri Duncan (Shailene Woodley). Meanwhile, Marine lawyer Stuart Couch (Benedict Cumberbatch) is recruited to be the prosecutor to give the prisoner a death sentence.

13 July 2021,evanston_dad,8," Underrated
","I had modest expectations going into ""The Mauritanian,"" a screen adaptation of the book ""Guantanamo Diary,"" which blew the whistle on the U. S. treatment of prisoners of Guantanamo Bay. Usually, if a movie as Oscar-baity as this one fails to receive a single nomination, it's because it's not very good. So call me pleasantly surprised when I discovered the film to be the exact opposite.",/review/rw6634405/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2021,deloudelouvain,9," Another scandal from the USA, the land of the free...
","Movies based on true events are always more interesting to watch and when it's a story like this one you can't help it to have very opiniated emotions. It's another (yes there are plenty) scandal coming from the land of injustice (even though they think they are so rightful whilst the opposite is much more accurate). The land of freedom and justice, of opportunities, where people are treated like equal no matter what your religion or skin color is... That's how they like to portray their country. If you tell yourself a lie long enough you might start believing it. The Mauritanian is a powerful movie with excellent actors. Tahar Rahim did a great job playing his character and so did Jodie Foster. It all starts a bit slow but as soon as you get into the story you can't take your eyes of the screen. Guantanamo Bay, another enormous scandal everybody knows about by now, another scandal where nobody had to pay the price for their wrongdoings, a scandal where the only ones that paid a very high price are the innocent. It's not a movie that will leave you with a pleasant feeling, but it's for sure worth watching. To me one of the better movies I watched this year, or even in the last decade.",/review/rw6634405/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2021,atractiveeyes,9," Mindblowing
","This movie is just mindblowing, heavy and so important. The true story is so sad but also interesting and important. The movie portrayed it so nicely; the screenplay is great and so is the storytelling. Performances are all superb specially by Tahar Rahim who gives an Oscar-worthy performance. The Mauritanian is a nice decent important well crafted biography. A must see.",/review/rw6634405/?ref_=tt_urv

",A very timely release for THE MAURITANIAN - the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attack coupled with the controversial withdrawal of troops and civilians from Afghanistan as that twenty year long war ends. Finally we are offered insight into the Guantánamo imprisonment of 'suspected initiators' of terrorism through this true story as offered in Mohamedou Ould Slahi's book GUANTANAMO DIARY written in 2015.,/review/rw6634405/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2021,nancyldraper,8," At the film's core is outrage
","This is a difficult movie to watch or write a review on. At the core is outrage. Those who don't want to believe that such outrageous things could be done by their beloved country and those entrusted with its values and justice will deny its assertions to protect the vision they hold as sacred. Others will raise their fist and proclaim they fight for the right of those abused and violated. Both sides will claim they know the truth. I am not surprised by man's inhumanity. Indeed, my faith calls it original sin. The difference being, I believe we are all capable of it. But my faith also believes in deliverance and hope, responsibility and the power of redemption. This film does a remarkable job of representing this man's story. The performances are flawless. The storytelling is compelling. The warning is important. For those reasons, I give this film an 8 (well told) out of 10. {Drama}",/review/rw6634405/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2021,somf,8," A much better film than the recent ""The Report""
","A lot of great talent make this a particularly riveting film. No punches are spared when it comes to how incompetent and inhumane Rumsfeld's policies were at Guantanamo. I criticized The Report for being too visceral in trying to make its point. This film had some very disturbing scenes as well but they were much more effective. You actually cared for the characters in the film. The Report and the Mauritanian make the same points, but where the Report was dry with little character development, The Mauritanian tells a fascinating personal tale.",/review/rw6634405/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2021,outlander,9," Sad but true story about Guantanamo Bay.
","I think The Mauritanian gives a very insightful look at the extent governments will go to coverup how the treat prisoners. Here in the United States and other countries around the world. Doing all that can be done to get false witness against anyone.
The end does not justify the means, which is something brought to light in this movie. This is a true story from the story told in the book Guantánamo Diary, written by Mohamedou Ould Slahi. It tells of his experiences in Guantanamo Bay.
Maybe one day we will learn to treat each others as humans and respect deserved until the facts are proven.",/review/rw6634405/?ref_=tt_urv

","Whether he is guilty or not is not important, but the West cannot claim the higher moral ground while we imprison and torture without trial. The USA has bombed houses around the world who have been killed by association. They have simply been in contact to someone deemed a terrorist. The story is superbly acted and will leave you angry at what is being done. This is a compelling story of a man plucked from Africa and being tortured to obtain a confession, thankfully there are people in America who stand up for peoples right, in Britain we are drifting and presently they are trying to ban protests that cause annoyance, we need voices that cause annoyance.",/review/rw6634405/?ref_=tt_urv
