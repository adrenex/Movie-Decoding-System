8 September 2004,gpadillo,," No Mystery - Just Great Movie-making
","Mystery Alaska was one of the best comedies to come along in 1999. In the best ensemble film fashion a truly eclectic cast forms the very core of the story that is Mystery, Alaska. Hank Azaria turns in a spectacular performance as ""the ugly duckling""  a character not too popular who escaped the town for fame and fortune in television sports. He garners the small town some big time noteriety when the announces that the New York Rangers will challenge a game against the locals pond hockey team. Typical small town chaos ensues as all prepare for the big event.",/review/rw0516600/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2000,jhclues,9," It's More Than A Hockey Game
","It's cold in the small hamlet of Mystery, Alaska, but there's plenty of warmth in `Mystery, Alaska,' the film, directed by Jay Roach, about the town and the sport that is ingrained in the collective consciousness of the community.  Hockey is the game, and when a former resident, now a journalist, writes a story about Mystery's home-town team and their `Saturday Game,' and it ends up as a three page spread complete with pictures in Sports Illustrated, it has far reaching effects on the populace of this small dot on the map.  Soon the town is turned upside down, embroiled in an event, the proportions of which, to them, are huge. Needless to say, it involves hockey and an encounter with a high-profile professional team.  Yes, there is a lot of hockey in this movie, but be advised, this film is not `about' hockey; this is a movie about people real people and what makes them tick. 	Roach has crafted a thoroughly entertaining and emotional story of want and need, dignity and desire, obsession and love, and he's captured it all through the winning performances of a stellar ensemble cast, the most prominent of which is Russell Crowe.  The charismatic Crowe, finally on his way to superstardom thanks to his turn in `Gladiator' plays John Biebe, Mystery's sheriff and captain of the hockey team.  His rugged good looks and persona fit the character perfectly, and he puts all of his myriad personal resources to work to put it across, and that he does.  Also notable is the personable Mary McCormack as John's wife, Donna, who does a great job of fleshing out the character of this woman who made what she deems to be the right choices in her life, without regrets or apologies to herself or anyone else.  It's a refreshing portrayal, and the chemistry between her and Crowe is unmistakable.  Also adding to the overall texture of this film are Hank Azaria, as Charles Danner, the journalist who gets the whole thing rolling; Burt Reynolds, as Judge Walter Burns, a man forced to deal with his own personal issues, which include a son, Birdie (Scott Grimes), a member of the hockey team; Colm Meany, as Scott Pitcher, Mayor of Mystery, and Lolita Davidovich as his wife, Mary Jane; Maury Chaykin, as Bailey Pruitt, the man who seems to personify the very essence of Mystery's spirit; and Ron Eldard as `Skank,' another member of the team who's good for two thingssuffice to say that hockey is one of them. 	Mercifully, `Mystery, Alaska' never pursues the beat-the-dead-horse cliched mentality that sports `teaches one to be a team player and builds character.'  Instead, Roach has given us a worthwhile, memorable movie with a human touch, and because of that, in the end these are people you care about, as individuals as well as a community.  The climactic game is exciting and far from predictable, beginning with the celebrity they bring in to sing the National Anthem.  This may not be one of Russell Crowe's biggest or highest profile movies, but this is one he's going to be able to look back upon with pride, because it's right up there with his best. Remember, you don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy this movie; all that's required is that you have a membership in the club know as Mankind.  I rate this one 9/10.",/review/rw0516600/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2016,claudio_carvalho,7," Better than You Can Imagine
","In Mystery, Alaska, hockey is the pride and joy of the residents of the small town. Their hockey game every Saturday is the greatest entertainment of the locals that are proud of their amateur team. When the reporter Charles Danner (Hank Azaria), who moved to New York many years ago, returns to Mystery by helicopter, he meets Mayor Scott Pitcher (Colm Meaney) and proposes a game against the powerful New York Rangers to be broadcast live. The captain of the team and sheriff John Biebe (Russell Crowe) is cautious and warns that the other team is professional and their team might become a national joke and destroy the proud of the locals. But Mystery challenges the Rangers and the Mayor invests money building a facility around the pond for the game. Meanwhile Charles rekindles the feelings of his former high- school sweetheart Donna Biebe (Mary McCormack), who is married with John with three children. While the hockey players live their daily problems and dramas, the Rangers call off the event bringing frustration to the population of Mystery. But the lawyer Bailey Pruitt (Maury Chaykin) travels to New York to defend the game in court and the challenge is scheduled. Who will win the game?",/review/rw0516600/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2004,Howlin Wolf,9," Seldom have I come across a script so good for a premise so slight...
",... That a film so seemingly inconsequential pays such care and attention to its characters is to its utmost credit. Before viewing I mistakenly assumed this was a gig Crowe took only because he needed the career-boost. How wrong I was!,/review/rw0516600/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2000,chrisbrown6453,8," A pleasant combination of Bad News Bears meets Varsity Blues.
","The preview for this movie does not give the audience enough of an idea of how well this movie actually plays out.  Russell Crowe is not just an ill-mannered detective from Los Angeles, or a Gladiator from ancient Rome; no, in Mystery, Alaska, he showed that he indeed has a nurturing, almost lovable side to him. Mystery is a small, quiet town located smack dab in the middle of Alaska. It is a town where hockey is the most important thing in their lives.  There are special ""Saturday Games"" where the town's Mayor, and two other board members select a few townsfolk to play against each other for the enjoyment of the other townspeople. When an article about this town and their hockey playing is published in Sports Illustrated, The NHL decides that the N.Y. Rangers would play an exhibition game in Mystery, Alaska for a little publicity. ",/review/rw0516600/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2000,Philaura,7," This Story Should Have Been a Book
","I enjoyed this film.  It, as others have said, had great heart. The many important subplots of the film were played out very convincingly by a fine group of actors.  But the issues and how they came to be were only skimmed over leaving you wanting to delve further - know more. The fairly realistic ending would have had a much bigger impact if we could have felt closer to the characters.  This great little story could have really hit the spot with a closer look via a good long book.",/review/rw0516600/?ref_=tt_urv

11 October 1999,Boyo-2,10," Pretty funny movie
","I was drawn to this movie because I love hockey and Russell Crowe.  Both are seen to good advantage in this sweet movie. I thought it dragged in parts and some of the drama is forced, but overall it was a enjoyable movie and I had a good time watching it.  It has a terrific cast - any movie with Chaykin, Meaney, Ivey and Davidovitch as your supporting cast has a lot going for it right there.",/review/rw0516600/?ref_=tt_urv

26 May 2006,billsccc,8," a pleasant surprise
","I had no idea at the time that I would enjoy a movie about hockey, and I was right, because this movie had nothing really to do with hockey.It's a great character based movie about a small town that makes it big and the reason the town makes it big is because of it's people. It's a great rocky type movie that makes you root for a small town and it's wonderful characters. Russell Crowe is excellent as well as the entire cast and a great turn by Burt Reynolds as the town judge and coach. This is a very well crafted, witty , warm and realistic and just a charming movie overall. Don't let the hockey fool you, this is a movie about people and a quite enjoyable movie I may add.",/review/rw0516600/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2019,Kirpianuscus,," I love it !
","Not exactly for hockey, moral lesson, humor, performances. But for the lovely, realistic, sweet portrait of a place and its people. For the small incidents, friendship, jokes, sexual life, local pride and for Russel Crowe in his perfect role. It is a film about sport. But it has the science and courage to risk be more. A film about ordinary people front to a huge challenge. Giving the wise answer. A film about solidarity and force and love. And , sure, about local patriotism. In beautiful manner.",/review/rw0516600/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2000,Quinoa1984,6," Nice Comedy with Hockey
","I liked this film.  Not loved it, but liked it.  One because of it's cast (Russell Crowe, Hank Azaria, Burt Reynolds, Mary McCormack, Lolita Davidovich and Mike Myers), two because of it's association with hockey (also because it associates with my favorite NHL team The Rangers) and three because of it's few (yet good) scenes.  Jay Roach also comes into his first real film that is not a parody (he directed the 2 Austin Powers flicks). Plot involves Azaria, who is a Sports Illustration writer who can (and will) bring the New York Rangers to the small (yet powerfull) hockey team in the community of cold Mystery, Alaska.  Great character development provided by writer David E. Kelly (who makes a jump from Lake Placid and Ally McBeal). Not in the best of the year film category (because of a few flaws) but it isn't terrible either, especially because of Mike Myers cameo as a Canadian sportscaster.  A-",/review/rw0516600/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2007,PersianPlaya408,8," A good early film with Russell Crowe
","I found this feel-good comedy drama involving a small town hockey team who gets a chance to compete against the professionals. I thought Roach's film was fairly original and a much better hockey movie than mighty ducks, though it isn't saying much, i thought this was actually a pretty good film. it was entertaining, the screenplay and direction were simple but suitable. Crowe played the roll of the washed up player very well and Hank Azaria was also very good here. I thought this was one of the better Hollywood mainstream films, and i am surprised as to why it is rated so low and A scent of a woman is 7.5 on IMDb. both of these films had flaws, but i don't think they are vastly different in quality. Anyhow, i liked Mystery alaska and recommend it to anybody whose looking for a simple yet interesting film to watch. IMDb Rating: 6.3, my rating--- 9/10",/review/rw0516600/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2002,TxMike,," I enjoyed it more than I expected.
","Somehow I had gotten the impression that ""Mystery Alaska"" was not a very good movie. To the contrary, it is very enjoyable. Burt Reynolds is perfect as the judge who is down on his son for a low ambition and, when playing in the Saturday hockey games, not passing. Russel Crowe is perfect as the town sheriff who is being snubbed by the Saturday hockey team. Hank Azaria is perfect as the former Mystery boy who goes to New York, writes a story about the Mystery hockey team, and gets a match with the New York Rangers set up in Mystery.

","I must admit, the first time a saw a poster of this movie, I thought it would be silly and dumb. Therefore, I avoided watching it. After a couple of years it was on TV and I didn't have anything better to do at the moment, so I sat down and watched it. After seeing it, I was sold!!!! Wat a great and fun movie to watch. I spent the next 2 years looking for it on DVD. Thank god, movies are much easier to find in the US. During my internship here I finally found it.",/review/rw0516600/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2010,Movie_Muse_Reviews,7," Good ole hockey fun, silly comedy, small-town drama
","It goes without saying that ""Mystery, Alaska"" is all about hockey, but the spin on that is that it's about more than the sport and that's the difference maker between a good and great sports film. ""Mystery"" falls somewhere in between those compliments, but transcending hockey is what this movie can hang its skates on. The title says it all. Instead of being called ""cliche underdog title,"" or ""intense sports words"" it simply refers to the town it takes place in, because that's what's at its heart. Even if the sexual humor is completely awkward and the swearing uncalled for, this movie is about the pride of a small town whose very existence centers around hockey.",/review/rw0516600/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2001,Anonymous_Maxine,10," Wow! It really IS the Rocky of hockey!
","Mystery, Alaska is kind of like The Mighty Ducks, except that it's intended for an older, more intelligent audience. The characterization as well as the narrative structure is much more mature, and the players, thankfully, are not little kids but people with a wide range of ages that have played hockey their entire lives as a result of having always lived in such brutally cold weather.",/review/rw0516600/?ref_=tt_urv

","Growing up in a small town in western Michigan, with a long running tradition of hosting a minor league hockey team (Which WAS at the time the Pittsburg Penguins IHL Affiliate) I grew up loving hockey. I am usually pretty skeptical about hockey movies because they usually focus on goons, or make a mockery of the sport like ""The Mighty Ducks.""

","A second viewing of this fine film confirmed my impressions of the first viewing: it is good fun combined with some exciting action, even if the plot is a little contrived. Russell Crowe, as always, is stoic and believable in the lead role and Mary McCormack is delightful as his faithful and supportive wife.  There are some funny moments throughout and a heartwarming finale. Not a classic exactly, but well worth seeing more than once.",/review/rw0516600/?ref_=tt_urv
