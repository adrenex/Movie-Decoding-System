14 February 2003,rbverhoef,10," Excellent
","This week I saw three things based on WW-II novels. The first was 'The Pianist' about the Warsaw ghetto in the war and the survival of a Jewish pianist in that ghetto. The second was 'De Tweeling', a Dutch film about two twin-sisters, separated in 1926. One of them grows up in Nazi-Germany, the other in The Netherlands. That movie shows us more of the common persons during the war, Germans and not-Germans. The third was 'Band of Brothers', a true story about combat in the war. All three things are great, the films I mean, and you definitely should see all three of them.",/review/rw5804763/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2004,philip_vanderveken,10," This series is so unbelievably realistic, so authentic.

",Band of Brothers absolutely one of the best miniseries of all-time...period. Not only that but it's also among the very best war movies/tv shows ever created! It follows the story of a US Army airborne division called Easy Company and their missions in Europe during World War II. It follows the brave soldiers and their experiences and bravery during the war. It's based off interviews with survivors of Easy Company and the soldiers letters and journals they wrote. EVERY episode is so incredibly written and the cast is absolutely amazing! It is a pulse-pounding accurate depiction of war that will keep you glued to each and every episode. I have to warn you that it's a tough watch but absolutely worth it.,/review/rw5804763/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2001,bsmith5552,10," Realistic WWII Drama With Warts Included
","""Band of Brothers"" in a word is awesome. I couldn't wait to see each episode. Co-Executive Produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, it has the realism, look and feel of Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) but with more insight into the characters. Hanks even directed one episode himself.",/review/rw5804763/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2015,planktonrules,10," You can't beat this....
","""Band of Brothers"" is a nearly 12 hour long show about the experiences of a group of soldiers during their tour of duty in Europe during WWII. Given that it is this long, it allows so much more in the way of character development and story telling than a typical war movie. The closest thing to this quality-wise is the original version of ""Das Boot""--as it was a mini-series and was later spliced apart to make it a motion picture. But even then, the German submarine film was only about 40% as long and never got into the detail and had quite the emotional impact as ""Band of Brothers"". In every way, the show screams quality--with amazing sets, details and direction. In fact, while the budget for this was large ($125,000,000 according to IMDb), it was actually pretty small considering the number of actors, the amazing sets and the length of the series. This is a must-see for anyone and I would say more and heap more praise on the film except that there are already hundreds and hundreds of other reviews on IMDb that pretty much do that already.",/review/rw5804763/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2001,theshape79,," Definitely at the top of my list for one of the best shows produced for television.
","I didn't really want to comment on the show like others did, until it was actually concluded. Now that the show finished last night all I can think to say is Wow! This has truly been one of the best things I have ever seen produced for any format of entertainment, except novel since historian Stephen Ambrose fills in a lot more information that the series just couldn't handle. Every actor from Damian Lewis to the man who played Private Hall in the first episode performed admirably. Of special interest is Lewis who's character really matures as the show progresses, Ron Livingston who in episode nine loses some of the cockiness that his character Nixon exhibits throughout the show, Matthew Settle who plays the intimidating Capt. Ronald Speirs just seems to ooze the violent edge the character needs, and Donnie Wahlberg who unlike his brother seems to play more interesting characters. Also of special interest is David Schwimmer as Capt. Herbert Sobel. Even though the character is pretty much a piss ant, there is that one moment after he loses command of the company that you sort of feel sorry for him. Another plus is the production crew who really turned England into four different countries. No one place from  Carentan to Bastgone looks like the same country. Another plus is the special effects, which really shine in episode two and four. The night jump on Normandy with the flak exploding around planes and one plane bursting into flames looks as good as anything done for a major film. Also whoever thought of including snippets of interviews with real easy veterans definitely help set the tone for the episodes. A good choice in my opinion. If you haven't seen this show you owe it to yourself to watch any repeat. If you love informative movies about WWII by the DVD Set which will hopefully be released sometime soon. Another thing to note is the documentary which has interviews, film footage, and war time photos of the actuall easy company. I hope its as good as it looks.",/review/rw5804763/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2005,yodaschoda,10," One of, if not the best, mini series' ever made
","Band of Brothers finds us following the exploits of Easy Company throughout their campaign in Europe, from their inception all the way to the end of the war. The commentary from the actual soldiers that were in those situations is touching, to say the very least. These commentaries also help to move the character development along quite a bit, as it lets us into their own personal thoughts on the situations they faced. This project, to the best of my knowledge was undertaken at roughly the same time as Saving Private Ryan, using many of the same locations and also employing DreamWorks special effects, giving it a very familiar feel for anyone that has seen Private Ryan. As I've already touched on, the character development is greatly due to the fact that this story is not told in a two hour segment, but throughout several hour long intervals, giving us the chance to truly ""get to know"" the characters personalities as the story develops. In my humble opinion, the only other military type mini series' that even come close to the scope of this one are The Blue and The Grey, and North and South.",/review/rw5804763/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2002,grahamsj3,10," A-1, TOPS, the BOMB what else can I say?
","Judging by other comments, it seems that this miniseries struck a chord with many viewers. I almost hate to add yet another glowing endorsement since the other reviews are pretty much identical...but here goes. This one made me wonder WHERE DOES AMERICA GET SUCH MEN? The things that Easy Company (boy, there's irony for you!) went through. I've always been grateful to all those who fought for my freedom (I served my country but never had to fight) and have wondered how men could do the awful things that had to be done. I've admired those who actually faced combat. Anyway, Band of Brothers is superbly done historically correct documentary about E Co, 101st Airborne. It follows the lives (and sometimes deaths) of the men of Easy Co. The miniseries takes the men through most of their combat engagements. The cinematography is outstanding. Spielberg and Hanks really did a great job on this miniseries! There are some interviews with some of the survivors, who have remained close to this day. Disks 1-5 are the actual miniseries but WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T SKIP DISK 6! There is a lot of information about how the film was cast, the ""boot camp"" that the actors went through and how soft actors were turned into lean, hard fighting men. There are more interviews with surviving members of Easy Co. Folks, this is a don't-miss series!",/review/rw5804763/?ref_=tt_urv

8 December 2002,erwan_ticheler,9," Best Mini series ever
","Band of Brothers is a brilliant mini series about W.W. II.It tells the story of Easy company,a group of soldiers who fought in this terrible war.The first couple of episodes are about the drill of the men,the drill-sergeant is played by David""Ross from Friends""Schwimmer(not quite Full Metal Jacket).Then the company gets dropped on D-Day in Normandy where we follow their moves.The serie ends with an episode after the war when we see the company,or what is left of it,""relaxing"" at a lake and thinking over this dreadful period. BoB is very realisticly filmed with great acting,although there are no big names in it.Maybe that is why it is so realistic. The series is produced by Tom Hanks(directed 1 episode) & Steven Spielberg,so it couldn't miss. And it doesn't,all 10 episodes are of very high quality,from the training in peaceful areas to a big shootout in the woods of Belgium and from fights in my own country Holland(with actual Dutch actors!) to a grueling episode about a concentration camp.",/review/rw5804763/?ref_=tt_urv

2 August 2022,TusharViv,10," HBO will never make a show like this again.
","This is peak television. It's authentic and characters feel very real. It feels like you're there, you feel the tension, not made by bad cliches of modern tv shows, but because you're so immersed and on edge all the time. There is no sense of hero vs bad guy, it just feels like everyone is a loser in this. They don't just try to make the other side all look like evil people just to get audience on their side, they just show how it is and what needs to be done. The characters are not perfect, that's what makes this show good. In modern tv shows, they need all the main characters to be perfect and all their actions need to be justified and they need to be likeable, and this and that to a point where they don't feel like real people. Here they do indeed feel like real people so when they die, you really do feel bad and this sense of loss resonates whether it's one of the main character that dies or a German who's also just following orders on the other side and is just as scared. If this show was made today, the show would be more concerned with trying to emotionally attach you to a bunch of main characters who get saved in a cliche way every time and of course they have to be diverse even if it didn't make sense, and add some women as well, story comes second, actually just change the story massively just to fit your own narrative because it's fiction anyway and they treat audience nowadays like braindead zombies who can't think properly so they'll have 1 dimensional characters and a 1 dimensional plot and like they have the attention span to sit through downtime so they got to throw in drama everywhere. I'm glad this came out when it did, HBO would never make something this good nowadays.",/review/rw5804763/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2002,wildcatt268,10," One of the best war movies/series ever
","I have read virtually all of Ambrose's WWII books, and this mini-series faithfully follows one of his best. The experience of these men of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne, was mirrored throughout the many divisions of Army and Marine ground troops in WWII. I feel that this series represents that collective experience in the finest, most forthright manner possible and pays tribute to them all. The acting, mostly by previously unheralded actors, was superb--particularly that of Damien Lewis (Capt.Winters). Winters had to mature along with his increasing command responsibilites, had to learn to turn over his initial company-level responsibilities to others as he was promoted to battalion commander.  It was clearly tough for him, particularly when he had to order attacks on heavily defended objectives, without being to lead his former command directly.   All of the characters were developed enough that you cared about each of them as individuals, and felt the loss of each of them through the attrition during the brutal fighting in the Northern European Theater. They cared for each other as fighting men do (confirmed by my own experience in the infantry in Vietnam), but at the same time they had to carry on with the mission regardless of loss.  Replacements are regarded warily at first, but then managed to blend in with the veterans if they showed they were worthy of joining this band of brothers.  The plot is real, and as such is neither macho nor macabre--it just is presented as it really happened.  The truths of combat are stranger than fiction.  The interviews with the actual veterans, interspersed throughout the series, added authenticity, verified what the series was showing. These representatives of ""The Greatest Generation"" did themselves and this nation proud. Though I knew the story well, I eagerly looked for to each new episode to see how well it tracked with the book and how well the actors and director portrayed it.  Up to this series, I had thought that ""Once an Eagle"" (starring Sam Elliot) was the best war series, but this one is now at the top of the class in my view.",/review/rw5804763/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2016,bob the moo,," Often brutal but always engaging
","It has been some time since I watched this show on first broadcast – long before streaming and on demand, I remember it was appointment television for me to be sure to be back in time to watch it (I also did not own a VCR back then I think). Coming from the pedigree of HBO, BBC, and Spielberg, the series was a really banner affair, and it did not disappoint. Watching it again 15 years later, this is still the case. The production values are incredibly high, and the recreation of the conditions, spirit, and specific actions of Easy Company is compelling television. It is not constant action, and it is not always violent, however it keeps the war constantly in the air, and it is quite oppressive viewing at times in the way it does this while throwing in moments of sudden pointless violence.",/review/rw5804763/?ref_=tt_urv

The production design is fantastic. The acting is phenomenal. The score is rousing and the direction is spot on. It's ""Saving Private Ryan"" but ten hours long and, honestly, better. It's a series that holds up nearly two decades later and will forever be among the greats that the small screen can produce.",/review/rw5804763/?ref_=tt_urv
