9 August 2016,planktonrules,10," It will leave you shaken....
","Before you consider watching ""Spotlight"", I STRONGLY urge you to think twice. It isn't because I think it's a bad film--it's amazingly good. But it's also a difficult film to watch--particularly if you or someone close to you has been a victim of sexual abuse. I know that in my case, it was particularly tough because I am a retired psychotherapist and used to specialize in working with sexual abuse victims and perpetrators...the latter, which, I think benefit very little from treatment (which is much of the reasons I changed careers).",/review/rw3400166/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2017,TheLittleSongbird,10," A heavy subject dealt with rivetingly
","'Spotlight' to me was a very worthy Best Picture winner. Even if it didn't do much for me, which it did, it would still be appreciated for what it set out to do and would have been applauded for trying.",/review/rw3400166/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2015,A_Different_Drummer,10," One of the greatest horror films of all time
","... because by the time the credits roll and you start to breathe normally again, you will suddenly realize that this was not a horror film as such, this was a re-enactment of events that actually happened, with real victims and real perpetrators and real well-meaning third parties covering up the whole thing as fast as the body count kept piling up.",/review/rw3400166/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2020,0w0,9," Not often that a film truly entertains as well as informs...
","Sometimes, a film of this type makes a real impact... just sometimes... But, it very often doesn't have any impact at all like in the case of movies like Dark Waters (Dupont) or Deepwater Horizon (BP) or Love & Other Drugs (Pfizer/Eli Lilly) or The Big Short (Banks) or Thank You For Smoking (Tobacco)... I'd like to think that this film had at least a measurable impact on society and more specifically, the amount of sexual abuse cases in religion... and that in itself, is commendable.",/review/rw3400166/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2016,miriam-seraia,10," A movie that qualifies as strong meat a.k.a. be ready to digest a lot of reality and face the true face of a world unknown to people living in a happy bubble.
","This movie undid something inside of me. It's that part of you that holds on to hope that people can be good, that there is hope for humanity. I knew the basics of it when I went to watch it: that it is about investigative reporters looking into a story of abuse in the catholic church. And it uncovered so much more than just that. Honestly, this movie should be seen by anyone who seeks the true face of the world. We don't live in a pink bubble of happiness. F*cked up things happen to people all the time; worst thing is when it happens to the innocent. The little ones who can't protect themselves. When they are robbed of their faith and their hope and their future. Sitting in the film theatre on the last row, I was brought to tears as in front of me a long list of places where victims spoke out was scrolling. I was both shocked and mad. I felt sorry that people can fail so miserably. ""Mike Rezendes: They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you, it could've been me, it could've been any of us."" Indeed. When we witness darkness and we shut up and we don't do anything about it, that's when we fail. A poet once wrote, ""You can join the millions talking in the dark. Or you can stand up and scream light, out into the night."" So choose to stand up. In your profession choose to eradicate the oblivion of evil. This movie is a masterpiece. From the dedication of the actors to their roles, to the script, the director and the cinematography. The score? Fantastic. Howard Shore did it again!",/review/rw3400166/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2015,boatsfra,10," Fantastic Movie Filled with Sadness
","Going into the theater to see Spotlight, I had read the rave reviews and knew I was in for something special. This movie did not disappoint! Being from Boston, this movie really made me think about my life growing up, as a lot of ""what ifs"" came to mind. ""What if"" I went to church every Sunday...""what if"" I was gullible enough to have a priest lure me into his lair. Spotlight goes straight to the heart of this amazingly sad (and apparently never-ending) saga of the Catholic church and the amount of abuse priests have inflicted on hundreds of victims. The acting is all-around fantastic, from Mr. Keaton to some actors that I am not familiar with, which is an aspect of this fine movie that makes it so profound. Tense throughout, I was saddened to hear that this abuse is an epidemic and probably will never be stopped. The exclamation point was when a member of the audience stood up and told the rest of us ""...I am a survivor..."" WOW...",/review/rw3400166/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2016,bob the moo,," Engagingly told story of process, with a strong emotional core
","By coincidence I watched this film only a week after listening to the editor in chief of Huffington Post UK say that authentic writing cannot come from paid journalists, which is why they do not pay their writers (although Adriana Huffington seemed fine with the millions she got when she sold the website). This stuck in my mind when watching this very fine drama about how the Boston Globe reporters uncovered and exposed a mass cover-up of abuse within the Catholic Church. Also in my mind was a sense of disbelief that this true story is not too much more than a decade old â€“ the mass abuse of children by Catholic Priests now just seems such a known thing now that it is hard to imagine a time when it wasn't.",/review/rw3400166/?ref_=tt_urv

28 February 2016,classicalsteve,10," All the Vatican's Men in Outstanding Investigative Journalism Film Revealing the Skeletons in the Boston Archdiocese's Closet
","In ""All the President's Men"", young reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncovered a national political scandal when they, through their investigative journalism, revealed the White House under then President Richard Nixon was using campaign funding to finance dirty tricks of political enemies, nicknamed Watergate. In ""Spotlight"", a similar team of investigative reporters reveal a scandal of epic proportions which makes much of the Watergate scandal seem tame by comparison. They uncovered widespread sexual abuse of minors committed by priests of the Roman Catholic Church who, in turn, hid the crimes. Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Walter V. Robinson (Michael Keaton), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), Martin ""Marty"" Baron (Leiv Schreiber), Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) work for a group of investigative reporters within the Boston Globe called ""Spotlight"" who succeed in finding the skeletons in the Boston Diocese proverbial closet. For many years prior to the sexual abuse scandal, Spotlight had investigated and reported on many other ground-breaking stories.",/review/rw3400166/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2016,Mr-Fusion,9," Burns slow, but riveting to the end
","Garnered awards and horrifying subject matter put aside, take a look at the movie poster for ""Spotlight"". It's a still image of the principal cast hovered over a cluttered desk in a small room. It's not flashy, but still an incredibly effective piece of advertising. You know in an instant that this is a journalism movie; die-hards in rolled-up shirtsleeves working all hours to unearth a national scandal. I am an absolute sucker for this.",/review/rw3400166/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2016,mrshev,10," Super film
","It won best film, deservedly so. This is a film that resonated with me long after I watched it. The complicated tale of the investigation of paedophile priests in Boston and the publication of it is told in riveting fashion by Tom Macarthy who does not waste a frame or a scene to anything less than the plot or character development. I never felt the running time or in any way disbelieved any of the actors in their portrayals.",/review/rw3400166/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2015,ClaytonDavis,10," Flat Out Remarkable! Possibly the Year's Best!
","Seconds after the credits for Tom McCarthy's ""Spotlight"" roll, an overwhelming feeling of changing your career takes over. Is film criticism really where I belong? What important, life-changing story am I not writing about? Truth is, quite a bit of classic films give off that same feeling. ""Rocky"" made a bunch of our fathers and older brothers go for a morning run and drink raw eggs. ""Rudy"" made us want to go out and play Notre Dame football. ""Spotlight"" makes you want to go down to your local courthouse and search the public records for clues. Then, get on the phone, with a pen and a pad, and start asking some really tough questions. Honestly speaking, ""Spotlight"" is the best investigative news drama this century. Matter of fact, behind ""All the President's Men"" and maybe ""The Insider,"" it's among the best ever made.",/review/rw3400166/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2016,brendandevere,9," Catholic Church in the Spotlight.
","Relevant, powerful and astonishing. Shocking, criminal and true. These are the only words to describe this film as it has literally put the 'spotlight' on the systematic cover-up by the Catholic Church of mass molestation and sexual assault acts performed by the priests in the Boston archdiocese that were trusted in the communities they represented. These 'men of God' preyed on the weak and vulnerable for years and the most powerful religious sect in the world did nothing but sweep it under the proverbial carpet. 'Spotlight's' dramatic importance has immediately drawn the attention of film lovers who crave a riveting production that dives deep into a very real circumstance that has impacted every corner of the globe.",/review/rw3400166/?ref_=tt_urv

","Spotlight is a 2015 American biographical drama film directed by Tom McCarthy and written by McCarthy and Josh Singer. The film follows The Boston Globe's ""Spotlight"" team, the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative unit in the United States, and its investigation into cases of widespread and systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Roman Catholic priests. It is based on a series of stories by the real Spotlight Team that earned The Globe the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.

Calm and clear, it is said that it is also very appropriate for the real office and living environment of journalists. Of course, in order to maintain this tone, the story of the news itself has been weakened, and the character of the reporter itself can not be deeply shaped.",/review/rw3400166/?ref_=tt_urv

31 January 2016,jtindahouse,7," A fine film but not worthy of winning Best Picture
","Going into 'Spotlight' I was aware that it was the front runner to win Best PIcture at the Academy Awards. After having seen it I can't really understand why. That's not to say it wasn't a good film, it simply didn't blow me away at all. It told a story, an admittedly fascinating and true story, in an informative way but it didn't do anything that great films do like inspire me, move me or leave me stunned with the powerful nature it was told with. Best Picture winners of the past, like 'Schindler's List', told true stories but also encompassed all three of those traits and plenty more. That was a film I will never forget, 'Spotlight' will probably be completely out of my mind by this time next week. Frankly, I was a little underwhelmed with the lack of emotion such a serious subject brought out in me. The film just didn't really seem to try to do that. It felt more like a documentary reenactment, simply with very fine actors, than anything else.",/review/rw3400166/?ref_=tt_urv

However, I can make an exception for SPOTLIGHT, a film which looked fantastic from the trailer and what I had read about it.

21 November 2015,ThomasDrufke,10," Ignorance
","Tackling subject matter like Spotlight does is very difficult to portray on film. You have to accurately tell the story enough to not create outcry while also not relying on the weight of the source material in order to induce emotion. It's difficult, but certainly not impossible and Spotlight did pretty much everything right. The acting from one of the best ensemble casts of the year is phenomenal. Everyone gave such a great performance that no one ended up stealing the spotlight, pun intended. The directing is top notch as Tom McCarthy perfectly weaves between scenes without any wasted screen time.",/review/rw3400166/?ref_=tt_urv
