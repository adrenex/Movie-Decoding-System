29 September 2015,kosmasp,6," Enjoying rather than studying
","And this is true of both the characters in the movie and the viewer. Well the latter should rather try to enjoy as much as possible. Because the science behind it all does not really mix well together. A problem that the movie is not alone with. Mingling with time and trying to make it plausible is almost impossible. Just a few have managed to get the ""technical"" things right or rather the things right that would seem logical.",/review/rw3175524/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2015,Jerghal,5," How stupid do they think teenagers are?
","Project Almanac is a found footage time travel movie. And as far as time travel films go this must be one of the worst I've ever seen. It takes them almost half of the movie to make the damn thing (with old car batteries and Xbox 360 parts) and once they have the power to travel through time, what do they do? Go to parties and concerts coz apparently they were to stupid to go to them like in normal time. The movie also does little effort to respect some time travel rules like concerning duplicates off yourself already being there at the same place etc. Spoiler: they redo a certain part like 8 times (groundhog style like the characters correctly state) to do...a chemistry test over and over. WTF??? Then they get the fantastic idea to play the lottery, they f*ck it up by only filling in 5 of the 6 numbers correctly so they only win 1,8 m$ instead of 53m$, and THAT they only do once??? I have to say I've never seen a time travel flick where the characters and the retarded plot enraged me so much as this one. I know the target audience is teenagers but even they must have seen better in this genre. The directors next movie is going to be 'Power Rangers'. I'm wondering if he was so stupid to choose that himself or if the studio execs wanted to punish him for making dumb movies.",/review/rw3175524/?ref_=tt_urv

","David Raskin (Jonny Weston) applies to MIT with the help of his friends Quinn Goldberg (Sam Lerner), Adam Le (Allen Evangelista), and his sister Christina Raskin (Virginia Gardner). He could only get a small partial scholarship and his mother is looking to sell their home to raise tuition money. While looking for his late father's experiments in the attic, David finds an old video of his 7th birthday but it has his older self in the video. He and his friends find parts of a time travel machine hidden in his basement. They reconstruct it and travel back in time with his crush Jessie Pierce (Sofia Black-D'Elia).",/review/rw3175524/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2015,cadillac20,6," Won't Reinvent The Genre, But It Is Entertaining
","I liked Project Almanac. It didn't necessarily excite me. And I did scratch my head a few times. But ultimately, I liked it. It had an interesting, if slow moving, story. It stayed grounded, or at least tried to, and did it's very best to legitimize time travel as a possibility, even if it doesn't do a very good job of actually explaining the whole thing. Certainly some things are silly, like explaining being able to control the time machine with a cell phone as cell phones 'having enough power to put a rocket in space', but these don't really take away from a lot of the fun dealing with the time travel element.",/review/rw3175524/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2015,Zielke9,8," i had doubts going in but i ended up liking it
","I just finished watching Project Almanac and if you haven't seen it yet, you might want to check it out. I was pleasantly surprised being that I had low hopes going in. it's another found footage movie, so if you are sick of them you might not enjoy it very much. Also if you're already not into time travel or science in general you might leave the theater with a bad taste in your mouth. I ended up enjoying it quite a bit and if I had to compare it to another movie I would say it has a strong feel of Project X and Chronical mixed together with the bases of it being more scientific then social(Project X) or supernatural(Chronical). You'll spend more time than usual feeling happy for the characters as they're having fun rather than the usual dose of drama every five minutes to keep people chewing their finger nails wondering what's going to happen next if Marie finds out Tony was talking to Marisa behind the bleaches and all that teen nonsense. it had a few mistakes but it's a movie so get over it. If I had to say one bad thing about it, I couldn't. I love science, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and for me it was an easy line drive down the middle of the plate knocked right out of the park. Personally I would give it a solid 8 out of 10 but if you're not a science buff you might be looking more at a 6-6.5 out of 10.",/review/rw3175524/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2015,med77_99,2," An insult to movie goers intelligence
","Just watched this last night, and I have to say it is one of the worst time travel films I have seen. For starters, the writing is a joke, the whole plot is weak and lacks any logic or intelligence for a movie based on science!! It is not smart and is filled with stupid plot holes that are quite insulting to us movie lovers. A lazy work of writing here.",/review/rw3175524/?ref_=tt_urv

19 May 2015,luke5119,7," Entertaining and Thought Provoking
","Much like Chronicle, this film profiles exactly what would happen when you give teenagers certain powers. In Chronicle it was ""super powers"" in Project Almanac, it's the ability to travel through time. There were elements of this film that made me give it far more credit than I would normally have.",/review/rw3175524/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2016,Wizard-8,," Sometimes intriguing, but too long and drawn out
","It seems the ""found footage"" film genre is in no danger of dying out any time soon. This one at least tries to mix in another genre that has proved popular over the years, the time travel genre. Not only that, but it also makes the main characters teenagers. Naturally, with the movie covering more than one angle, the results are interesting at times. The screenplay does try to make the movie more intelligent and logical than usual - for example, the movie takes its time by showing the teens (realistically) making multiple tests on the time travel machine before trying it on themselves. And when they do start trying it on themselves, the actions they do one by one do seem believable.",/review/rw3175524/?ref_=tt_urv

8 March 2015,rjsf96,3," A Tired Premise, Laughable Characterisation and Found Footage All Make 'Project Almanac' an Utter Failure
","'Project Almanac' has all the hallmarks of a Michael Bay production; stolen ideas, annoying characters, an excessive runtime, bad directing and shameless product placement. Many of these factors can be attributed to another produced Bay film which came out in 2014, 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'. I will be fair to this film; the trailer intrigued me enough to want to seek this one out in the cinema. Until I saw text that read 'from producer Michael Bay' then I shuddered in horror, I had signed myself up for an appalling experience in every sense of the word.",/review/rw3175524/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2015,The-Sarkologist,9," High School students discover the secret of Time Travel
","A part of me likes some of these 'found footage' films though they can be a bit hit or miss. However they have certainly come a long way since the days of the Blair Witch Project (which I really didn't like all that much). Some of them, such as Chronicle, can be quite disturbing, but one thing that I must say is that they can be very difficult to do well, and Project Almanac is certainly one that has been done really, really well (though it is certainly not one of those low budget films that appear every so often, such as Paranormal Activity).",/review/rw3175524/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2015,mattkratz,8," interesting time travel film
","This was a good movie with a good concept and an interesting point of view. It was shot ""differently""-from like a hand-held camera point of view, which I think helped the atmosphere, and I also liked the references to other time travel movies like Timecop, Bill & Ted, and Looper. After spotting himself in present form in a reflection in an old video, a teenaged kid realizes his father has left him instructions on how to build a time machine, and he and his friends proceed to build one, and agree to terms like never ""leap"" alone and record their leaps. They initially use it for their own gains like passing classes and winning the lottery. However, future leaps later have disastrous consequences! If you are into time travel films, you will love this one. It has humor, action, and great lines. I liked it.",/review/rw3175524/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,4," Bland, forgettable and hokey, 'Project... wait, what did I watch, again?
","'Project Almanac (2015)' is so utterly bland, not to mention ultimately forgettable, that you simply can't care about anything happening on-screen. It almost doesn't matter that the film relies so heavily on convention and breaks its own rules a number of times, mostly those relating to its overall presentation rather than its time-travel mechanics, that it becomes nothing more than a time-looped repeat of better films past... almost. There's nothing to draw you in here, not the hackneyed plot or hokey acting or humdrum presentation, and there's no real surprises to keep you interested once you are. You can totally check-out and still understand the purportedly 'complex' plot. 4/10",/review/rw3175524/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2015,BrentHankins,7," Minor issues detract from an otherwise enjoyable time-travel flick.
","Time travel is always a tricky subject for a filmmaker to tackle. It's been done countless times, with countless interpretations, and most attempts struggle to show us anything we haven't seen before. But every once in awhile, someone comes along with an idea that breathes new life into the genre, and aside from a few stumbles in the third act, Project Almanac fits nicely into that category.",/review/rw3175524/?ref_=tt_urv

""the phone call is interrupting the wifi"".....someone please punch the writer in the face. Phone calls and wifi are on completely separate frequencies.
