29 June 2009,WriterDave,7," ""I'm not a likable guy...""
","Woody Allen's alter ego, Boris (a bitterly good and sardonic Larry David) makes this statement to the audience rather early on in ""Whatever Works"". The truth is, no matter how misanthropic, sarcastic and neurotic Woody Allen is, he ultimately is a pretty likable personality...if you like that type. Allen's return to Manhattan after three stays in London and a wonderful stop-over in Barcelona is yet another niche film. Fans of Allen, as well as fans of Larry David's ""Seinfeld"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" (which not so ironically should be the same folks) will find plenty to laugh at here, while others will inevitability whine, ""I don't care for Woody Allen...and oh, that Larry David! Can't stand him!"" ",/review/rw2158173/?ref_=tt_urv

18 October 2010,claudio_carvalho,7," Cynical, Witty and Hilarious Return to New York
","In New York, the bitter and grumpy Professor of Quantum Mechanics in Columbia University Boris Yellnikoff (Larry David) is a snobbish and pretentious intellectual that claims to be a genius in String Theory and that the world is completely wrong. During an existential crisis, Boris ends his marriage with Jessica (Carolyn McCormick) and jumps through the window to commit suicide. However the canopy saves his life and Boris becomes limp and quits his job in Columbia. He moves to an old apartment downtown and gives chess classes to children to make some money. When the simpleminded religious Mississippi runaway Melodie Saint Ann Celestine (Evan Rachel Wood) asks for food to him, he temporarily lodges the girl in his apartment. Along the days, the atheist Boris shapes Melodie to his thoughts and the girl, impressed with his pretentious geniality, fits his world. Despite their difference of ages, they marry each other and have a routine life. However, the world of Boris changes when out of the blue Melodie's mother Marietta (Patricia Clarkson) arrives in their apartment.",/review/rw2158173/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2009,ferguson-6,6," Real Men of Genius
","Greetings again from the darkness. Such an odd experience ... watching an old Woody Allen for the first time. Well that's the best way I can describe this. The script was from the 70's and certainly, Mr. Allen made a few changes to make it fit the 21st century, but still we can't help but think it's 1977 all over again ... especially since Woody has been away from NYC for awhile.",/review/rw2158173/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2009,Movie_Muse_Reviews,7," A trip back to vintage '70s Woody Allen that's almost convincing
","For those wondering what happened to the old Woody Allen, here he is. ""Whatever Works"" is a script from the 1970s. I noticed that without even knowing Allen has been forthright about it. A few script rewrites -- talk about the Taliban and not the Communists -- and old Woody works in a modern context. Then again, ""Whatever Works"" is not a film that anyone will herald the second coming of great Woody Allen comedy, but it is one that will win over a handful of audience members.",/review/rw2158173/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2009,Gyran,10," Bleakly funny
",When Woody Allen's films are released in the UK I usually blink and miss them. I happened to be in France this week so I was able to catch Whatever Works which is having its first general release in that most Woody-friendly of countries.,/review/rw2158173/?ref_=tt_urv

5 July 2009,carped,10," Woody has done it again
","The critics have missed on this one. Don't believe the negative reviews. It's the funniest one from Woody since maybe Deconstructing Harry. Everything works. From the very original script, combining Allen's bleak view of life with effervescent farcical plot line, to uniformly fine performances from Larry David, Evan Rachel Wood, Patricia Clarkson, and the rest of the cast. Comedic sparks fly non-stop. Not just light chuckles here and there at Woody's witticisms, but loud all-out laughter. The scenes with Ed Begley's and Patricia Clarkson's transformations of 'classic text-book right-wing material' are especially hilarious. And in the end I came out from the theater, thinking that in a paradoxical way it was one of the most life-affirming pictures from the master.",/review/rw2158173/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2009,boydens,9," See this movie and then read the external reviews
","I saw this movie in a packed cinema and the audience loved it to the extent that many applauded at the end. So I came home, looked it up in IMDb and read some of the review by professional film critics. What I found helps to explain why nobody reads papers anymore and why professional movie reviews are increasingly irrelevant. The critics drooled all over themselves for No Country for Old Man -- a ridiculous blood bath where the bad guy can see through walls, magically find people on the run, and kill repeatedly without raising much more that a mild interest from the local and state police. Yet many of these same critics think the characters in this new Woody Allen film aren't realistic. God save the film critics.",/review/rw2158173/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2009,ryancm,9," It works
","This is Woody Allen's best film in years. Hard to believe some people didn't like it. Mr. Allen is in top form here and it would have been great seeing Allen play Allen, although Larry David is good. The real stars of the movie are Evan Rachel Wood and the great, wonderful, terrific Patricia Clarkson. She is one of our greatest living character actress's working today and hope to see her in many more films. She adds class and perfection to everything she does.",/review/rw2158173/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2010,alicecbr,10," Clarification of their lives from BOTH Woody Allen and Larry David
","Amazing the news that passing time brings up: This story of a brilliant Nobel Prize (almost) winner reminds us now of another Nobel Prize winner on ecology, Pres. Gore (rightly). Instead of this movie being just about Woody's rationalization for marrying his young step-daughter who must indeed have idolized his brilliant ideas....it is ALSO about the Nobel prize winner's attraction for Larry David's ex-wife. This is his attempt to explain to us HIS take on why those break-ups happened.",/review/rw2158173/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2009,jzappa,8," Anything You Would Ever Hope From Either of the Two Comic Masters.
","There is something to Woody Allen's method of working that, as ironic as it may seem to his general appearance, outdoes most other great filmmakers working right now. Every year since 1967, he has come out with at least one film. He had no idea what end of the camera had the lens when he started. By now, he has come across such a wide array of different genres, themes, casting and setting staples and classical influences that, with a career that has had unequivocal consistency, he gives us precisely what even the most remote Woody Allen observer would expect from him, but with such an intensely enriched mark of mastered skills as both a writer and a director and the age that has been spent mastering them. It is a simply, classically structured story about an old Jewish man that can't stand being so much smarter than everybody else. And so he is.",/review/rw2158173/?ref_=tt_urv

22 July 2015,grantss,8," Woody Allen back to what he does best
","Woody Allen is back to doing what he is famous for - clever introspective comedy - and he still does it well. He detoured into making crime-dramas, three of them - Matchpoint, Scoop and Cassandra's Dream. All of these were good, and one, Matchpoint, was brilliant. Then he made a pretentious drama, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, which wasn't good (but people seemed to like it just the same).",/review/rw2158173/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2009,A_Minor_Blip,1," Whatever... It Just Doesn't Work...
","A hotdog consists of rejected parts of a pig all thrown together and picked up off the butcher's floor. This is Woody Allen's hotdog. Many of the elements are borrowed from past films, like his fourth-wall-breaking first-person-narrating philosophy of life being meaningless and love being luck and everyone is dying and... all that stuff that was once entertaining when Woody Allen was younger, and funny.

14 February 2011,merklekranz,1," The script is old, and feels it. .... Larry David playing Woody Allen is annoying. .............
","Larry David looks like a taller version of Woody Allen. His appearance, talk, and mannerisms, are creepy duplicates of Woody. So the big question is, why have Larry David doing a Woody Allen imitation, instead of just having Woody Allen star in the movie himself? I cannot tell you what a distraction it is watching, what appears to be a clone instead of the real thing. As for the story, it comes across as what it is, 1970s material, the same old religious rants and philosophizing. Plus, the film is very redundant, especially relating to the intelligence difference between Larry David's Character and Evan Rachel Wood's. Even the welcome appearance of Patricia Clarkson and Ed Begley Jr. doesn't help. - MERK",/review/rw2158173/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2012,RainDogJr,," Chest lessons by Larry David. And some typical things about relationships
","It was very odd that this Woody Allen film was released in my city nearly two years after its premiere. So in 2011 we had two Allen films: this one and, of course, MIDNIGHT IN Paris. And I still can't believe this: I didn't watch any of the two! I broke my run of watching Allen films on the big screen, which began with SCOOP and, sadly, ended with YOU WILL MEET A TALL DARK STRANGER (that was by far my least favorite of his films from the past decade). But I recently got both ""Midnight"" and WHATEVER WORKS on Blu-Ray",/review/rw2158173/?ref_=tt_urv

1 December 2010,Petey-10,8," Woody Allen back in New York
","Boris Yelnikoff, a misanthropic chess teacher and a former Columbia professor, keeps spending his days of talking about the rotten world.Then a young girl enters his world.The simpleminded Melodie comes from Mississippi.The age difference between these two is pretty huge, not to mention the other differences, but they end up getting married.Whatever Works (2009) is a Woody Allen film.The music heard in this movie is pretty great.There's everything from Beethoven to Groucho Marx and the cast.The acting work is pretty superb in this movie.Larry David plays Allen's alter ego, Boris.Evan Rachel Wood is Melodie.Ed Begley Jr. and Patricia Clarkson play the girl's slightly annoying parents, John and Marietta.Henry Cavill is Randy Lee James.Michael McKean plays Joe.Conleth Hill is Leo Brockman.Olek Krupa portrays Morgenstern.Christopher Evan Welch is Howard Kaminsky.Carolyn McCormick plays Jessica and Jessica Hecht is Helena.Woody Allen turns 75 today, so congratulations.The man still keeps working like crazy, coming up with a new movie every year.Allen has done many movies in Europe, but this one he did in New York again.It's not the most successful return to his hometown, but the movie does work in many parts.The comedy part should be funnier, and there are some of the characters you find hard to like.The leading character, Boris, is an interesting guy.This guy admits he's not a likable guy, but yet there's something you like about him.This neurotic, hypochondriac, New York Jew, who doesn't like people.He does have some good qualities.And most off the stuff that comes from his mouth is pretty genius.That's because the man behind this film is a genius.Mr. Woody Allen.",/review/rw2158173/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2009,dierregi,2," Scarlett Johansson is too old for Woody
","I used to be a Woody Allen fan, but this movie was so disturbing as to make me change my mind. Basically it tells the story of a selfish, sloppy, arrogant and deeply troubled elderly man who has a gift for unhappiness. However and regardless of the fact that he is penniless, sarcastic, badly dressed and very unattractive on every levels (and lives in a dump), he still manages to attract beautiful young women, thanks to his intellectual superiority. Oh, by the way he also manages to live happily ever after.",/review/rw2158173/?ref_=tt_urv

","First, just so you know, I'm writing this review from France... but I'm from the U.S. That, so you don't disregard this as yet another Franco-Allen fan (they've exchanged their Jerry Lewis passion for Woody over here, and sanction everything he does). ",/review/rw2158173/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2010,tigerfish50,1," Humorless comedy coupled with dime-store philosophizing
","""Whatever Works"" belongs to the endless sequence of misogynistic Woody Allen films depicting romances between older men and much younger women. Unlike the underrated ""Elegy"" which approaches the subject with seriousness and sensitivity, ""Whatever Works"" is clearly supposed to be a comedy, but laughs are entirely absent as a dim-witted Southern blond sets her sights on an elderly, misanthropic know-it-all. Larry David plays this charmless romantic lead as a clone of his ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" curmudgeon, and ""Whatever Works"" resembles a terminally dire reject episode of the TV show. The acting mimics the style of provincial theatrical farce while the threadbare story unfolds through a wooden script. The characters are Allen's usual paper-thin caricatures, whose principal purpose is to proclaim his shallow philosophical preoccupations yet one more time. The direction is particularly witless, wasting the fine talents of Evan Rachel Wood and Patricia Clarkson, whose performances as the Bible Belt simpleton and her scheming mother are excruciating to watch. The end result is grinding, tasteless tedium - perhaps even worse than ""Scoop"".",/review/rw2158173/?ref_=tt_urv

","Woody Allen is back to New York City and he celebrates his return with a new romantic comedy Allen-style dedicated to his favorite place of earth and its ability to change drastically the lives of those who come from all over to Big Apple attracted by the lamp of Statue of Liberty that she lift for ""tired, poor, and yearning to breathe free...""
