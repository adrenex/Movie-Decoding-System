26 February 2002,LebowskiT1000,10," Great sequel!
","Despite most views of this movie, I thought it was just as good as (and in some aspects better than) the original.  Of course there was a lot  of recycled humor, but there was also a lot of original humor too.  I was a little bummed to find out that Courteney Cox wasn't returning in the second installment, but they did just fine without her.  I doubt it will happen, but I would love to see an Ace Ventura 3 someday.",/review/rw0354833/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't normally respond to these kinds of things, but after reading some of the negative responses I couldn't help myself. There is a movie out there for everyone, something everyone NEEDs to laugh at and who can relate to. This movie is the opidemy of my humor and the extreme way it portrays the upper crust world of stuffy, snobby, self absorbed unrealistic people who think the world revolves around their view and opinions is classic and makes me laugh in a way that is honest for me.",/review/rw0354833/?ref_=tt_urv

4 November 2019,planktonrules,7," I feel ashamed...but the film DID make me laugh!
","In this sequel to the very popular ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"", Ace is in Africa getting into all sorts of silly nonsense. ""Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls"" is definitely a guilty pleasure. While the film is very stupid and never tries to be anything else, it DID make me laugh...much like films like ""Waterboy"" and ""Stepbrothers"". A couple of the dumbest scenes had me almost falling on the floor laughing...such as when Ace gets spears in his legs and the scene where he's inside a fake rhino! Hardly intellectual faire....but funny. A great film to watch with friends....especially the sort of friends whose favorite DVDs don't come from the Criterion Collection!",/review/rw0354833/?ref_=tt_urv

29 May 2005,cinezone,10," excellent comedy movie!!!
","One of the best and my favorite comedy movies ever! I have watched it at least 7 times and found it funny each time. All those guys saying this part is not as good as the first one, must be out of their sense of humor! This part lives up to its expectations and i found it even funnier than the first part. You might get bored watching the first part 3 or 4 times but not this part! This is a must see film if you haven't seen it already. I own its DVD and keep it very close to my DVD player all the times...never know when i'd like to watch it again :-) I would give it a well deserving 10 out of 10, it cant get any better than this. I really feel sorry for those who didn't find it funny. Please Don't miss it...watch it today!!! Highly recommended!!!!",/review/rw0354833/?ref_=tt_urv

26 August 2014,ironhorse_iv,6," Alrighty then! This movie is really funny! A must-watch!
","Shikaka! Ace Ventura is one of my favorite movie characters of all time! This character catapulted Jim Carrey from small TV character actor from 'In Living Color', to A-list celebrity, when the film, 1994's Ace Ventura: Pet Detective became a surprise hit. The first movie was such a hit, it spawn a somewhat funny animated television series (1995 to 2000) and one really bad 2009 spin-off children movie, Ace Ventura, Jr.: Pet Detective. The best from all of these films, had to be the 1995 sequel, Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls. This film has developed a large cult following since its release and I agree with them. This movie in my opinion, is probably the funniest Jim Carrey's movie in the 1990s. Yes, I said it! Jim Carrey reprises his role as the title character Ace Ventura, a detective who specializes in retrieval of tame and captive animals. This time, Ace Ventura is heading to Africa, to recover a sacred bat stolen from poachers, before two African tribes go to war because of it. Directed by Steve Oedekerk, the movie did a great job in location. I really thought, the movie was filmed in some type of Africa country. Actually, the film shot in various locations in and around Charleston, South Carolina, San Antonio, Texas and British Columbia, Canada. Who knew! The writing for this film is just amazing. Not only is the jokes, more hits than misses to the funny bone, but it's very clever with its gross out puns/sight gags, pop culture references, and movie parody humor of previous films like 1993's Cliffhanger. The crime solving mystery of the film is also pretty brilliant. You really get into the story, as Ace Ventura recover clue after clue. The best highlight of the film is Jim Carrey's acting. The way, he can move his body in a silly way for slapstick humor was astonishing. In his day, nobody could touch this guy for pure facial and voice comedy. You can tell that Carrey is having the time of his life just ad-libbing and winging it. Yes, he did overact, a bit here and became more like a cartoon than a person, but his overacting as Ace made it, very entertaining. This was Jim Carrey in his prime. He was and still is a mad genius at making people laughs, but lately hasn't found good material and tamed done since then. If there was any reason to watch this film, it's for his performance here. You'll find yourself, laughing more than once. I remember my whole family were crying, unable to breath with laughter the first time watching this. Spank you very much, Ace Ventura for making me laugh. The main theme song is pretty catchy by Robert Folk. The movie does a great job using establish songs like 'Secret Agent Man' & 'Lion Sleeps Tonight' to add to the humor. Indeed, the movie did come with alternative versions, when aired in syndication in International countries and on television. In order to receive a PG certificate, the UK release of the film features a number of cuts, equaling one minute and 35 seconds for the theatrical release, plus a further three seconds when re-classified for home video. This version is the worst, as it cut really funny scenes like Bumblebee tuna balls joke, and alternative version of the 'rhino scene'. Don't watch this version. Just find the US standard. Nature Calls does have considerably less offensive swearing, sexual jokes, and vulgarity than the previous film, but it doesn't really affects the quality of the film. Yes, there was Product Placement. An obvious ad of Subway is placed on a highway billboard early in When Nature Calls, but it was used as a gag about being in nature. The pacing is a bit off for a 90 minute film. Honestly, they could have cut like the whole first 15 minutes as it takes him forever to get to Africa and the story to start. None of the first part in the Himalayas and Tibet were that funny to begin with. The supporting cast was a bit missing. The female lead, the Princess (Sophie Okonedo) was barely in the film, and just there for somebody for Ace to bang with. It's a far cry from big female leads of Courtney Cox and Sean Young from the last movie. At less, this movie get a really good funny supporting character name Oda (Maynard Eziashi) that made scenes way funny. Ian McNeice as Fulton Greenwall & Bob Gunton as Burton Quinn & Simon Callow really did work, well as the straight man stock characters to Jim Carrey's outrageous cartoon character. Even fellow 'In Living Color' cast member, Tommy Davidson, got a few laughs in, as the Tiny Warrior. Overall: It's a movie that you find yourself, rewatching it time after time, because it's so funny. You'll find yourself repeating the funny phrases and wisecracks. Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls is a must watch, must have, film to add to your comedy collection.",/review/rw0354833/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2003,Coventry,8," Guilty pleasure comedy
","Without any shame I say : I love this film. Jim Carrey is a great comedian in my opinion and the Ace Ventura films remain his best and funniest achievements. I recommend this film to everyone who needs a good laugh when they're stressed or something. It's true : Ace makes you forget all your daily problems. I can't count the times I couldn't stop laughing. The story...let's say that's not very important but there's is a plot. To avoid a war between 2 African tribes, Ace has got to find back the sacred animal which is a big white bat. To do this, Ace gets stuck in a giant fake rhino, has to do a survival test made up by savages and infiltrate in the high society levels. I assure you this all turns into hilarious situations. I'm not saying it's better than part one, but it sure is more light-headed and there's much more variation. For the rest, all the elements that made Ace Ventura 1 so good, are present. And tons of it !!! Jim Carrey is a rather limited comedian. Either you love him or you can't stand him. If you love him, and his rubber face expressions, this film ( and the first of course ) are the best to check out. He'll probably never win an Oscar or end up in the ""best actor ever""-list but I don't care. And I'm sure all other fans of this film don't care, neither",/review/rw0354833/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2021,adamjohns-42575,1," Farce!
","It was clear from the start that Jim didn't want to be making this film. His character was far more vulgar and aggressive and you can just see it in his eyes!
It's not a good story and despite its relatively good cast, it's not made well. The animals are cute, but where is the detective element. It's just a lot of Ace Ventura antics in the wild without thought or care or much of a script.
The whole thing seems to be tied together by Carrey ad-libbing.
There are no other returning characters and the recurring jokes are poorly executed.",/review/rw0354833/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,5," Entirely average, and very inferior to the first film
","Steve Oedekerk might be a talented film-maker(when I say might, I mean exactly that; I've seen no other movies by him, I plan on doing so soon, though), but he's no Tom Shadyac, and this film very much shows that. The humor in the first one was at times crude, but mostly civil(nothing you felt really crossed the line, in my opinion). In this one, it's flat-out disgusting; it's very, very crude, mostly has to do with bodily fluids, and there's too many sex jokes for my tastes(and bad ones at that). The film really has very little to offer for anybody but the biggest of Carrey fans(I am a big fan of him myself, and I found this film hard to sit through). Another problem is that it borrows too much material from the first; every good joke is copied directly from the first(several lines are exactly the same), and the movie tries too hard to make you laugh at things that aren't actually funny. I also found the disrespect and mocking towards the tribes fairly insulting; while they may not be civilized, these people are hardly lesser humans, as this film makes them out to be. Another thing I despised was the way they changed Carrey's character to the worse; in the first, he was eccentric, mildly annoying, but mostly funny, and somewhat smart, actually. In this one, he's just annoying, arrogant, childish and, well, completely pathetic. We're supposed to laugh at this character, but how can we possibly laugh when he's so utterly annoying? He was somewhat immature in the first, but here, he's like a spoiled brat. It really seemed like the director didn't get the point of the first film at all; Ace Ventura isn't funny because he's a pathetic loser; he's funny because he's eccentric yet smart, and he somehow manages to be appealing, though he is like a grown child. It's like Oedekerk just took all of the lesser points of the first film, magnified them, put in some of the good, and released it. The plot is less interesting than the first, the mystery is less involving, as both are obviously pushed into the background to allow for the ""humor"" instead. I also thought that the humor seemed far too forced and overdone; not one single joke was ""minor"" or a ""detail"". No, you have to show something completely ridiculous, and hope the audience finds it funny. One thing that I also have to mention is the special effects; they are truly horrible. I know that it shouldn't matter in a comedy, but come on, every single effect looked so fake. And who's decision was it to make that damn little ape appear in every other scene? It's not like it had a major part in the first movie, after all. It had as little a role in the first as any of the other animals. If they were going to bring back characters from the first, why not bring back some of the ones that work well with Carrey and his character; like Emilio, or Woodstock, or even Melissa. They were actually entertaining, unlike the supporting cast of this film. All in all, a very average film, and not really worthy as a sequel to the much better first film. I recommend this only to the biggest of Carrey fans, and possibly fans of Steve Oedekerk too. 5/10",/review/rw0354833/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2021,SP-10,8," Great! They told Jim to go for it and he did. Absolutely hysterical, brilliant performance
","Those expecting high brow comedy or a good film can look elsewhere. This was simply a vehicle for Jim to let loose with whatever he wanted to do. It is a complete improv of contorted faces, crude jokes and non-sensical one liners. It feels like a framework of script, nothing serious but enough to provide a storyline.

10 December 2004,dbdumonteil,2," one investigation too much for Ace Ventura
","The beginning of the film which presents a parody of the film ""Cliffhanger"" (1993) is the sole real acceptable idea of making in this flick. What's next? Well, simply, the rest remains at the zero level (and surely less) of what American comedy can deliver. Everything is out of control, including the script. All right, we can distinguish a story that could have hold water. But it is relegated to a position of secondary importance to give way to a series of cock-and-bull scenes where stupidity prevails. They are also scattered by ponderous racist jokes about the Africans and murdered by Jim Carrey's tomfooleries. He looks more like a retarded teenager than an animal detective.",/review/rw0354833/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2005,policy134,1," How the mighty have fallen.
","Ace Ventura - When Nature Calls, was the first movie I can remember that I simply had to see. Not because the first movie was that good but there was just something so mesmerising about Carrey that he was too important to ignore at that time. He had three hit movies in a row, although I didn't really enjoy Dumb & Dumber that much either. Boy, was I disappointed. Not only did the movie suck but there is a mean spiritness running all the way through the proceedings that is hard to swallow. I am not talking about the gross-out humor, like Carrey making the biggest loogie in history (by the way that was quite disturbing) but the director seems to think that Ace has to be the World's biggest jerk to survive in the African setting.",/review/rw0354833/?ref_=tt_urv

","By no means is this a great comedy, but it does at least have the guts to accept no concessions to good taste in pursuit of a laugh. You get the impression the studio simply let Jim Carrey out of his cage and told him to do pretty much whatever he wanted with his Ace Ventura character. He is basically about 90% of what makes this movie work, with the remaining 10% split about equally between Ian McNeice as the guide/interpreter and the monkey, who makes a surprisingly good `sidekick' for Ace.",/review/rw0354833/?ref_=tt_urv
