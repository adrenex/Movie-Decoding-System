26 July 2007,blanche-2,8," Low expectations but high results
","Reba McEntyre is one of those crossover stars who doesn't seem to be able to miss, no matter what she tackles. First, she took over for Bernadette Peters in ""Annie Get Your Gun"" and received rave reviews from New York critics, who probably were - excuse the pun - gunning for her. Then this comedy series came along on the WB channel. I'm always a little leery of sit-coms, particularly the off-network ones. Sometimes I think they pander to the lowest common denominator.",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2002,mattkratz,," great show!
","Reba McEntire makes a bold and decent foray into the sitcom world with this gem. She plays a lady who is in the midst of a divorce when she finds out that her soon-to-be-ex has made his hygenist pregnant, while Reba's teenage daughter is also pregnant and married to a high school football star. There are some wonderfully funny and touching moments in this show, and I like it.",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2006,liquidcelluloid-1,," With real laughs and clever writing, ""Reba"" is an unlikely front-runner for the best family sitcom on TV today
","Network: WB/CW; Genre: Family Sitcom; Content Rating: TV-G/PG (some occasional language & adult content); Available: DVD, Syndicated on Lifetime; Perspective: Contemporary (1 Â– 4); ",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2020,Sylviastel,7," Well then do something that will make them want to leave. Play that country music that you like so much.
","Country music star Reba McEntire starred in this sitcom as a Houston real estate agent and mother. She has to reinvent herself after her dentist husband, Brock (Christopher Rich), left her for Barbra Jean (Maureen Peterman. On top of that, her oldest child and daughter, Cheyenne, got pregnant with her high school boyfriend, Van.",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2003,stkids,," Surprisingly funny
","When this show first aired, I didn't expect it to be too entertaining, but I now find myself really hooked and interested in the plot and characters. The situation the family finds itself in - teenage pregnancy, a cheating husband, and now (at the end of the second season), the younger daughter wanting to move out of her mom's and into her dad's - doesn't immediately seem to lend itself to being funny, but this show pulls it off tastefully. It knows when to be serious due to the nature of the issues it deals with, but there are never a lack of laughs in an episode.  One of the best comedies on TV in my opinion!",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2004,IAmGlindaHearMeRoar,," Very cute and well put together.
","Single mother of three, Reba Hart (Reba McEntire) is a Texan soccer-mom who's husband left her for another woman. Reba's oldest daughter has a teen pregnancy, while her youngest daughter deals with puberty. And all the while, her son's main concern is being able to go over to his friend's to spend the night.",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2008,neeraj-singh,9," Reba is great
","During my 4 months stay in US for some business work, I got a chance to watch some of the old episodes of this TV series. I'd say that I liked this, It made me laugh.",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2003,agirlwhoreallylovesmovies,," I love this show!
","I started watching this mid-season of this year. I actually wasn't planning on watching it, but I had seen a commercial for it and thought it looked funny (and also was planning on watching ""Grounded For Life"", which follows it). I LOVED IT! The acting is great. I've seen Reba act in ""Tremors"" and watched her in ""Is There Life Out There"" a few years ago, but I had no idea that she could be this funny! I love this show and I will definitely keep watching it. The acting is hilarious, the writing is undescribably funny, and the cast is terrific. I love Melissa Peterman as Barbara Jean...I'd like to see a LOT more of her too. All in all, I give ""Reba"" 7 out of 10 stars.",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2021,myronlearn,6," Not A Bad Show
","Overall, this a pretty well written show with interesting characters. Reba leads the charge as a recently divorced woman who's still on good terms with her 'ex', played by Christopher Rich, and his new wife, whether Reba likes it or not. Wholesome but still funny.",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2022,tlharrison-59546,7," Good nostalgia show
",I'm glad I watched this show when I was young because it's a comfort show for me now in my 30s. It's hokey and some of the acting is eh but it's enjoyable.,/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2021,HelloBlockbuster,10," Well, it's 2021
",This show came out and I never had any desire to watch it; I figured it would be lame. Here I am in 2021 kicking myself because THIS SHOW IS AWESOME!,/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2018,AdrienneGrayceMusic,10," Not nearly enough seasons
","When I first heard that Reba was coming out with a new show, I thought, ""Oh great, another musician turning into acting"". I also didn't like the idea of having a show about a pregnant high school student. BUT...I gave it a shot and wow, what an amazing show. Reba was so funny, as the rest of the cast. As I am sitting here watching the reruns, I'm saddened by the realization that the show ended. Such an underrated show. I think if Fox ABC or NBC had aired the show, it would have lasted longer. The show had a teenage high school student who was pregnant but they did not glamorize it like I thought they would. The show brought real struggles teen moms and dads face, as well as other issues that parents/kids/teens face. Reba's smart witted comebacks and comments towards Barbara Jean are hilarious. I give a show a 10 because it was funny as heck, and very entertaining. I miss you, Reba!!",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2004,jakela23,," A fun, enjoyable, guilty pleasure...unexpected but true!
","I did not expect much from the initial presentation of 'Reba' but was staggered to find that I became slowly captivated by the show and it's characters. It is such a joy to watch. Yes, it's not an Emmy Award winning comedy but what it lacks in strong writing it makes up with great actors who obviously love what they do. You can see the pleasure in the actors faces when you watch them on screen and that is a rarity in television today. The actually love what they do and it shows. ",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2019,starwisher,10," Hilarious!
","I love rewatching this show. The writing is so funny! Van and Reba are my favorite characters, with the witty comebacks (Reba) or comical reactions to everything (Van.) Everyone else is great too. I love how well they handled several life topics and how Reba always has the best way to talk through it with anyone who needs to.",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2004,PHeath60,," A Great Show!!
","I have been a fan of ""Reba"" for 2 seasons now, and each season gets better and better! This is a terrific cast, well suited and complimented to one another, with Steve Howey doing some of the best physical comedy I have seen in years..he is a natural at it...give this guy his own show someday when this one is all said and done! ",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2022,DrCharlesMontague,2," Reba should stick to singing.
","I like Reba McEntire and I think she's a great singer and performer. This show was a bad idea though. It's hard to know where to start, but basically Reba was jilted by her dummy ex-husband when he impregnated his obnoxious assistant, and said assistant has a creepy obsession with being Reba's best friend. Meanwhile there is bad parenting in droves. The oldest daughter lets herself become pregnant in high school by her dumb boyfriend, and the younger daughter is full of anger and snide remarks, and the youngest kid is basically ignored. The plots are ridiculous and although there are humorous moments, the whole thing really isn't funny. It's all kind of irresponsible and, not to mention, unrealistic.",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2007,InvisableMirages,6," This is full of side-splitting jokes that even when watching the 5th time, you'll laugh till you cry
","I never did watch ""Reba"" for the longest time. I had no idea why. Then one day I left it on the show and just was kind of half-watching it. And it was love at first show.",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2007,katiemartens-1,10," A dysfunctional ""full house""
","I was quite sure I would hate this show, but once it appeared on Lifetime (TV network) nearly every hour, I was forced to watch an episode... I don't know if I have ever LAUGHED SO HARD at a TV show! Being a 23 year old girl, I was first drawn in by ""Van"", whose quasi-hammy/ quasi-brilliant antics are ridiculously endearing. But after only two episodes (in the middle of what season I don't even know!) I was drawn into ""Reba's"" life, her worries and fears, and more so her laughs. ",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2004,wbrickk,," A Good, Decent Family Comedy
","Hats off to TheWB for a good family show. The ratings for ""Reba"" speak for themselves! This is the type of show this country needs. No Blood! No Profanity! NO Gratuitous SEX!!! I salute TheWB and Reba for this quality show!",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2007,Nick Zbu,1," Awful retread of '50s sitcoms
","While it would be easy and accurate to go into why 'Reba' is at its heart indicative of many 'family-oriented sitcoms' in the way it rips off from other better sitcoms, the real truth is that the show is repetitive, full of stereotypes from funnier and more groundbreaking shows, and the lead star is completely out of her element. While I'm sure Ms. McIntire can sing and has a fan base that supports that, being in a sitcom shooting out zingers and calling her the next Lucille Ball is far, far removed from reality.",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2001,Pheebs1487,," Fantastic!
","""Reba"" is a fantastic new show, and Reba McEntire is fabulous playing Reba. She plays a Texas mother in the midst of divorce who finds out that both her daughter, Cheyenne (Joanna Garcia) and her husband's mistress, Barbara Jean aka BJ (Melissa Peterson), are both pregnant.  Reba is forced to plan a marriage for Cheyenne and her football-playing boyfriend Van.  Throughout the show they go through troubles, but always stand through.  Reba is a very strong character, and Reba is a very good show.  If you haven't seen it yet, you should.  Watch it on the WB Friday nights, and enjoy!",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2022,JSGal,2," POOR FAMILY DYNAMICS!
","I believe the character of Brock is one of the biggest jerks played on tv, and his wife has got the be the stupidest. Van and Cheyenne have been by far the most selfish, putting their own ""wants"" before what is best for Reba. Like the time they forged her name after she refused to co-sign for their apartment. Then the time when Van told her s gay football agent that Reba was super gay! He and Cheyenne should have been asked to move out a long time ago! This show doesn't demonstrate good family dynamics at all!",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2007,math_drama,9," The Characters are too Different from Each other
","This show is really funny, but the characters are too different from one another. Reba is the serious mother who tries to make the best out of bad situations every once in a while, but not all the time. Brock is the ex-husband who is dumb and cannot balance his life with Barbara Jean, Reba, and at his dental office. Barbara Jean is the annoying, perky stepmother who annoys anyone except Brock. Cheyenne is the teenager who was pregnant, and she misses her life before she was pregnant, and she keeps trying to go back to the life, even though she has a daughter. Van is Cheyenne's husband, and he only seems to like her, but not love her. Kyra is both the annoying little sister, but also the strong older sister who tries to stand everything. Jake is the cute little boy who gets weird thoughts into his head, but still tries to be a regular younger child. Kyra is my favorite character, because she's not very funny, but more serious. That is the kind of character I like to act out when I act in school plays. Barbara Jean is my least favorite character because she seems to have a fake perkiness. It is like the character wants to be perky, but she isn't really perky. All in all, the characters are way too different from one another. If you love one character, then you'll definitely hate another character. This show can partway satisfy anyone, but it can't fully satisfy someone. But, on the plus side, it is funny, clean, and it deals with real life situations. Although the characters are a bit too wacky and everywhere, this show is great because it is appropriate for any age, it makes people laugh out loud, but it also makes people go serious and actually think about the plot. Other shows just go on and off, and no one actually thinks about anything, but after Reba,I'm sure that anyone would spend time thinking, despite the large difference between all of the characters.",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2021,sjpower144,8," I grew up with this show
","As an adult, this show is near and dear to my heart. It's so heartwarming and funny. I mostly watch it because of my mom, but it's a good show. The cast is awesome, especially Reba. She's tough and sweet, and she's determined to keep her family together. It gets a little boring over time, but most shows do. It can be a little unrealistic, but again, what sitcom doesn't.",/review/rw7443838/?ref_=tt_urv
