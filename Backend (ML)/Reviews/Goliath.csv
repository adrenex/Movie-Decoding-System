4 September 2009,cadillac20,6," Decent adrenaline rush with an interesting sci-fi twist
","The previews of Gamer didn't terribly appeal to me. However, after reading some initial reviews and seeing that the people over at Joblo found it to be pretty decent, I thought I would check it out. Was it what I thought it would be? Kind of. Was it entertaining? Sure.",/review/rw3100194/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2021,UniqueParticle,10," I'm one of very few that loves Gamer
","Sure it's cheesy bit damn good maybe cause Gerard Butler is awesome among other aspects! I remember seeing in the theater just wasn't reviewing back then either way appreciate it what it is. Mark Neveldine/Brian Taylor created such a bizarre story that is so dark and fun to watch! I recently decided to rewatch Dexter with Michael C. Hall being masterful, oddly he's just as great in this. I've got you under my skin is so good too.",/review/rw3100194/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2010,The_Dead_See,2," A warning to those who dislike ADHD music video directing and editing.
","The first run around, I turned Gamer off after thirty minutes. The directing and editing was so bad - with no single shot seeming to last for more than half a second - that I could barely follow the story and found the action unintelligible and boring. It is shot like a 2-hour long music video. No establishing shots, nothing subtle, rapid-fire editing, overuse of shaky-cam and not one single shot that isn't angled weird or pointing up someone's nose.",/review/rw3100194/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2010,bob the moo,," So-so at best, more notable for missed potential rather than what it does
","At one point during this film my girlfriend commented that it ""looked just like Modern Warfare 2"" – a game she has seen me play all too much and all too frequently. Indeed it does look very much like a FPS at times and this is the point of what is essentially the concept of The Running Man updated for the modern world of online gaming and living other lives out via the internet. Although the idea is far-fetched in terms of controlling people and indeed killing them, it is not a huge step for a fantasy film and it stays close to the world of Second Life, The Sims and the Call of Duty online shooter franchise. So, to my mind, this film had potential to be relevant, interesting, insightful or at least have loads of good action.",/review/rw3100194/?ref_=tt_urv

25 October 2009,Sirus_the_Virus,2," The best part: In the beginning where they showed trailers.
","Gerard Butler stars in Gamer, the worst film of the year. I was forced to sit through this crap though I didn't want to. The story itself is kind of interesting. But the film, it was just so wrong. Everything about this movie was a mess. It has mindless action, horrible acting, and the movie is just weird. Nobody wants to see a naked fat guy controlling a chick and having her get raped. I told you the movie was wrong. ",/review/rw3100194/?ref_=tt_urv

12 May 2010,Cujo108,," Middle of the road
","In a not too distant future, the world is obsessed with ""Slayers"", a game that allows it's players to control real death row inmates in a real world gaming environment. If they win a certain amount of games, the inmate receives a full pardon. The star inmate is Kable. He's won more games than any other ""Slayer"" has even come close to, and he's close to getting out. However, the game's billionaire creator, Ken Castle, has no intention of letting that happen.",/review/rw3100194/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2010,tieman64,," You don't live to play... you play to live.
","With the Great Recession (2007-2010) came the death throes of numerous mega corporations. But whilst Lehman Brothers, Bear Sterns, Merrill Lynch, GM, Ford and Chrysler all fell to their knees, the sales of gaming hardware/software hit an all time high. Games appeared to be recession proof, stay at home gamers turning to their Xboxes, PS3s and online universes. Coinciding with this came a huge decline in the number of young viewers attending cinemas (a figure that has been steadily dropping over the past 11 years), kids and teens turning instead to virtual games. Cultural theorists predicted this decades ago. Long before computers and gaming platforms became common household objects, guys like Baudrillard and Deleuze anticipated the end of the ""unitary spectacle"" and the age of interactive media and participatory networks of entertainment.",/review/rw3100194/?ref_=tt_urv

","Funnily, the movie does verge toward something interesting and possibly intriguing at two or three places. But alas--- nothing whatsoever came of any of that, and the plot simply oozed on, spreading outwards like the sludge from a spilt toxic waste barrel.",/review/rw3100194/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2022,janedoe5300,4," Too busy
","The premise of this movie is great, the plot is good, but the execution is terrible. The action scenes are horrible to watch, the camera cuts every 0,2 seconds, I felt like I was gonna have a seizure in the first 5 minutes. I get the idea behind using this sort of frantic camerawork too convey the sense of chaos that the characters are living trough, and it worked out great in the Crank movies (i thought the director(s) might have been inspired by those, turns out they made them) because it was just a tad bit more subtle. Those films conveyed the energy and insanity of their story and character in a perfect way, but the directors chose to turn up the intensity a couple notches too many here, and it spoils the fun. It's too bad, because it could have been a great flick, I actually cared for the story for a bit, but about 2/3 in I just couldn't watch anymore. I am positive however, that the last part wouldn't have redeemed anything, but it just might have given me a stroke at the age of 32.",/review/rw3100194/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2009,Jonny_Numb,7," Plug In and Power Up
","The duo of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor make movies that pummel, pound, and race with a freewheeling liveliness and attention-deficit style that is simply and utterly FUN. I find myself throwing out my usual stingy, nit-picking criticisms when it comes to the creators of the unapologetically sexist and blood-soaked ""Crank"" films. And their latest, ""Gamer,"" is like a cocktail of pure cane sugar and Red Bull injected right into the viewer's nervous system. In the not-so-distant future, video games have been taken the next level: instead of controlling characters on a screen, gamers command flesh-and-blood human beings whose brain cells have been spiked with the latest in nanotechnology. On one end of the spectrum, there is the candy-rave-colored ""Society"" (think ""The Sims"" with a ramped-up sleaze factor); and on the other, ""Slayers,"" an ultraviolent shooter where death row inmates are set loose in an enclosed area to annihilate anything that gets in their way. What makes this old concept seem fresh and vital (in addition to Neveldine/Taylor's starbursts of visual ingenuity) is how the phenomenon has consumed a society that gets off on the vicarious thrill of voyeuristic sex and sadistic violence, and the ironic relationships between the players and those who control them: Gerard Butler (seemingly standing in for the similarly inexpressive Jason Statham) plays Kable, the top ""Slayer"" who has seen his way through 27 of 30 deadly levels; his controller is a jaded, spoiled brat who is almost the equivalent of his celebrity (his game room is a panorama where video messages from eager groupies overlap with the gameplay); Amber Valletta plays Angie (Kable's estranged wife), who is decked out in skimpy attire on the ""Society"" set, and controlled by an obese, mouth-breathing slob. Elsewhere, billionaire game designer Ken Castle (a wonderfully over-the-top--if slightly underused--Michael C. Hall) is reaping the benefits of his creations while setting in motion his own shadowy agenda, and the anarchic underground group Humanz (headed by rapper Ludicrous) attempts to expose the slaughterhouse secret of the gaming industry to the oblivious, indulgent masses. While Neveldine/Taylor lay the groundwork for a social commentary about mankind's lust for thrills in the face of boredom, apathy, and the sloth of modern technology, they never get carried away to the point where it's a preachy downer (indeed, the exposition never goes on for too long); and while the ultraviolence directly contradicts a condemnation of such, ""Gamer"" delivers in spades on its multiplex promise: a fast, frantic, and fun flick with some food for thought thrown in.

5 February 2010,Superunknovvn,2," It's hard to believe just how bad this movie is
","I have absolutely no problem with mindless action flicks as long as there is something thrilling, something appealing, some little teeny weeny spark of a thought in them. ""Gamer"" has got none of the above. It's as mindless as it gets. The story is ridiculous. The action is badly filmed. The whole thing is as entertaining as watching paint dry. At times, the movie is almost hilariously bad. Why do the directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor insist on making the bad guys sing and dance all the time? It's not exactly a ""bada55"" thing to do, is it? And why does the movie in its final moment think it's ""Blade Runner"" all of a sudden, ending with almost the exact same camera movement as Ridley Scott's, hm, slightly better motion picture? Oh boy. This one is really hard to sit through. Jesus Christ, Gerard Butler, pick some better roles. ""The Ugly Truth"", now that. Three strikes and you're out, man.

","Imagine a version of THE RUNNING MAN, updated to the 21st century, and cross it with the popularity of modern-day video games (mainly Second Life and Call of Duty) and you have GAMER, an action film just as cheesy as the Schwarzenegger ""epic"". GAMER is the latest hyperventilation from the directing duo who brought us the two CRANK films, and its similarly outlandish, with a no-holds-barred approach to sex and violence. Sad to say, it's also pretty awful, one of those films which is going to date quickly and which has a dull-witted script keen to go through the usual clichés and gross-out moments.",/review/rw3100194/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2009,aa-ron-1,2," Seriously?
","You will see many many user comments here along the line of ""hey look, if you're looking for a film with story and reflection of the modern society, you won't find it here, you have to take the film for what it is, if you disliked it because you thought it was anymore than an action film, it's your fault."" etc, but that's exactly the problem, I went into this film expecting nothing more than Gerard Butler kicking ass, a film that's basically a video game where you won't have to be controlling, I didn't expect good story or good acting, I was in purely for a bit of special effects and a short amount of time to turn my brain off. Instead I ended up watching what seemed to be a desperate attempt to hook in with the teenager, with cringe worthy moments topped up with languages such as ""epic"" and ""owned"", and a story that's pulled out of someone's ass. the plot is so full of holes to a point where I almost wanted to walk out half way through.. (ie vodka and urine simply cannot start a car, if you can remotely control another person's mind, then reading data from someone's head isn't exactly a far fetch, therefore we really don't need lines such as ""I thought this technology won't be around for at least a decade""...

","I don't know where to begin.. It'd take me longer than the movies runtime to describe how truly awful Gamer is.

7 October 2014,adamscastlevania2,1," Total garbage, nothing more
",(7%) A truly dire mess that feels like it was directed by Beavis and Butt-head after a heavy drug and alcohol binge as the camera movements and edits during any sort of action will ruin your sight and the wafer-thin plot makes little sense (or did I simply stop caring?). And lastly the stupid song and dance routine at the end is the dog muck flavoured icing on the cake. I'm all for some juvenile fun in my movies but the feeling I got watching this turkey is that the makers need to grow up and make a proper movie and stop wasting money (this crap lost about $9 million at the box office) and using up my time with this garbage.,/review/rw3100194/?ref_=tt_urv
