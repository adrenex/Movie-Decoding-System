15 May 2021,GwydionMW,8," Entertaining and mostly historic
",Deals with the tough time Livia and her son Tiberias had before her rise. And believable.,/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,Xavier_Stone,2," The real housewives of Rome
",This is an 8 episode series with a strong female lead character being billed as the next Joan of Ark. It quickly dissolves into a routine family drama with bickering and infidelity to try and tease the viewer into caring about characters.,/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2021,Maelific71,7," Worth It
",Started out okay. Stuck with it as it gradually got better and better. I found it both clever and entertaining. At the end and I'm already anxious for the next season. I've seen some criticism concerning language. Seems a silly critique. They are speaking English for a modern audience. I can't imagine sitting through a lengthy series listening to the entire cast speak Latin just for the sake of being historically correct.,/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2021,Casamarciano,7," Better than expected.............
","I had no great expectations and was pleasantly surprised! I don't understand why people trash this show for allegedly inaccurate history. This is a series and not a documentary! The modern language only made the characters more believable to me. Again, I don't understand the criticism, should the actors have spoken in Latin?",/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2021,Acid_Reflex,8," Gets pretty good by end
","Starts out the first couple episodes and looks like it's going to be some millennial thing for the CW, but then it gets pretty good. Historical femme fatale material, but of course they have to make her less vicious and give her a cause being the woke era and all. Still pretty good though since she is one of the more overlooked historical women and there is a lot of story left if they continue on until her end. They could get a good 3 or 4 seasons out of this at least at the pace they are going and still keep things alive.",/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2021,James_Denton,8," In summary, a slow start but we thoroughly enjoyed it and are looking forward to Season 2
",Perhaps it was the low quality sets but it felt a slow start getting into this series.,/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2021,chrisgosling-42545,8," A good-looking and smart version of genuinely old story . . .
","Just finished watching the final episode of the first series of Domina, a very smart new show from Sky, based on the life of Liva Drusilla - wife of Augustus Caesar. I really liked it, mainly because it continued the theme of complexity and double-dealing initiated in the character by Sian Phillips, who played Livia in the series I, Claudius. I saw that when it originally broadcast in 1976, and have seen it a couple of times since..
This version of her story presents a much younger version of Livia, but I found many similarities and links which enhanced both series. You do need to concentrate to keep up with her, but its a worthwhile effort . . . Give her a watch!",/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2022,lwmswm,9," Excellent All Aspects
","Extremely entertaining historical drama. I, like many others, hope there is a season two. I said all I need to say but since a review must be 150 characters I added this last sentence.",/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2021,kq999,1," Rubbish
","This series is the most disgusting, obnoxious piece of rubbish ever created.",/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,spenfam-04145,8," Entertaining
","Very good, well written, well acted and I binge watched the whole series. I hope there is another. Tiberius is a gem.",/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2021,pietclausen,1," I came, I saw, I withdrew
","Whatever this series is, it is drawn out, but I managed to get to episode 5 before I bailed out. Nothing but nothing was interesting viewing. A big Sky disappointment.",/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2021,ronbell-23984,8," Good show
","I enjoyed it. Good story and feels authentic in terms of the sets, costumes and characters. Just be aware if you watch this, you probably won't route for any of the characters as they so unlikeable; a bunch of back stabbing b*******, all if them.",/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2021,bob-1135,1," Why just why?
","Watching this I began to wonder if the scriptwriter was paid extra every time he used the F - word. There was absolutely no need for all this, it added nothing and detracted greatly. And in case you were wondering I spent 15 years in the Royal Navy.",/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2021,Phantom_Duck,1," Real Housewives of Rome?
",It's easy to make an awesome production about Rome!,/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2021,leafarmer21,2," Couldn't get past episode 3
",I LOVE historical dramas and often don't even mind if there are wild inaccuracies - as long as the show is entertaining and well done.,/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2021,pompey2310,2," More Sky produced drivel
","Is this Spartacus.. Rome or even Plebs? Well the latter is more historically accurate than this garbage. A slow clunky script with dire acting. This is more Hollyoaks with both the language used and the gravitas of the actors. I could not help but laugh when a Roman tribune pipes up with 'just sayin'. Seems the budget was used up elsewhere as nothing was spent on research or script writers. It amazes me how Sky produce so much utter excrement, Bloods, Intelligence, Jamestown, lucky man, Bulletproof, Trollied, Britannia to name a few but also give us Chernobyl, Das Boot, Gomorrah to name a few...",/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2021,dk777,1," A Complete Failure
",A horribly written show that is not worth wasting time on.,/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2021,iconians,10," Kinda like Rome, just even more grittier
","So, many will compare this series to The Rome. I will comment on this below. The only thing I can't comment is what's more authentic, since these are not were meant to be documentaries.",/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,codexromanus,1," Dreadful & replete with historical inaccuracies
","HBO's ""Rome"" provided them with the perfect template for a historical model, unfortunately they chose to make a sexy telenova set in ancient rome with all the attendant overacting that the dialogue seems like the sort of recycled drivel you'd expect from ""The Originals"" or a CW production.",/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2021,TheTruthofItIs,1," Horrifyingly poor Roman series
","""Domina"" (S01, 8 eps, 50-mins, Epix) is just horrifyingly poor storytelling. Production values are just decent, the acting is CW-ish/soap-ish, and the sex and abject cruelty is transparently gratuitous. The three directors are unaccomplished rookies and one's first name is ""Debs"", really?! Only a few of the EPs have enough credits to even rate, and still those are unaccomplished. And the story itself is Roman politics - ugh, the importance of family with way too many birthing scenes - dbl ugh, the importance of alliances - ugh, and all the betrayal and skullduggery that travels with those things. It's just a wasted effort that I can't believe more than a handful of people nationwide would watch it to its end, let alone a second season which just should not happen.",/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2021,scaryoutcome1,3," Spartacus it is NOT!
","I only started watching this because with the name Domina, the clips I have seen and the era I was hoping for another Spartacus.",/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2021,Frankiesupafly,4," How does Livia's accent change...?
","This show started off slow but not bad. The English actress who played Livia was excellent... however, on the 3rd episode she's been replaced by a much older actress (looked 40), supposed to be 30 and with a Polish accent!!! Come on now! Couldn't you find another English actress that resembled her? I found out she's actually a Polish/Italian model, who cannot act... Such an amateur mistake!",/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2021,dcarroll74,1," Blah
","A terrible depiction of Roman history. Written, directed and acted by, people who have no idea of what Roman culture and history was like, at the time.",/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2021,negotiated,6," Almost good
","Decent cast and acting. Great sets and wardrobes but it was all a bit ... dull. Hard to follow and I didn't really want to after long. There was no aura of power or high stakes politics or regality. It was more of a soap opera about bickering families. A very very watered down ""Rome"".",/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,alvinpiecrust-39909,1," I should have known better
","I should have known better. Apart from Chernobyl and a few other rarities. As a rule if something is made by Sky it's amateurish. Twist for example. This is unsurprisingly bad, from the acting to the CGI. Do yourself a favour and avoid.",/review/rw6921860/?ref_=tt_urv
