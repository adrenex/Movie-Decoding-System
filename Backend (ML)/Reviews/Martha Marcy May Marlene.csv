18 April 2022,TheLittleSongbird,8," Guess what? It's good!
","Have been a huge fan of the Scooby Doo franchise since late single digits. The various incarnations vary in quality, with the best being the original 'Scooby Doo Where are You' and 'The Scooby Doo Show', also like a few of the shows that have a not so good reputation. And the worst being 'Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get a Clue' and most of 'Scooby Doo and Scrappy Doo' other than the surprisingly good first season. Also really like a lot of the animated films, 'Witch's Ghost' and 'Zombie Island' being my favourites.",/review/rw5705427/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2019,jeremycrimsonfox,8," A Neat Cartoon That Returns To Basics
","Scooby-Doo's 50th anniversary has been a rough one. With the DTV film Curse Of The 13th Ghost getting mixed reviews (with some criticizing it for not being true to the show it was supposed to give closure) and the new DTV, Return To Zombie Island, getting the same results (with some criticizing it for repeating the same mistakes 13th Ghost made), it seems that it may not be a good anniversary for the great dane that has solved mysteries since 1969. However, Scooby-Doo And Guess Who? is the one gem of this rocky anniversary.",/review/rw5705427/?ref_=tt_urv

20 July 2020,Tuefer_Benz,6," Fun but two-dimensional
","After the four Mook movies (starting with Zombie Island), Mystery Incorporated, and even Be Cool, Scooby Doo! fleshed out the characters with more complex motivations and layers of their personalities, this throwback makes them 2-dimensional again, almost caricatures who make their signature exclamations (""Jinkies!"" etc.) at every opportunity. It appears to be written for a younger audience than other incarnations of Scooby-Doo of the past two decades. Even the Hex Girls seemed like simpler versions of themselves. Still, it's kind of fun with an appealing look.",/review/rw5705427/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2019,BoxwoodExpress,7," A return to form for the Scooby Doo series
","The last Scooby Doo TV show, ""Be Cool, Scooby Doo"", was poorly received and really lowered the reputation of the SD series, even though I personally think it isn't that bad and most of its flaws stemmed from behind the scenes drama. This show, ""Scooby Doo and Guess Who"", is a vast improvement over that series and is a great throwback to the classic show.",/review/rw5705427/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2019,willylee123,9," Really Great Series!
","I so far love this show! I will admit that the first episode wasn't the best, but it definitely gets a lot better. The group dynamic, chase scenes, comedy, and different guest stars really help bring the show together. I'm so glad to see the original animation styles after witnessing Be Cool Scooby-Doo. It fall a bit weak in that each episode doesn't quite have the ""finding clues"" and ""looking for suspects"" kind of feeling as shown in the previous Scooby-Doo series. It also does feel a bit rushed, hence why took off a star. But, as a long time Scooby-Doo fan, I think this show is super solid! Definitely would recommend watching, long time Scooby-Doo fan or not!",/review/rw5705427/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2022,Milk_Tray_Guy,8," Season 1
","Basically a belated continuation of/homage to The New Scooby-Doo Movies (1972), but thankfully abandoning that series 43 minute format, and returning to the standard 22 minute. As in TNSDM, each episode features a guest star or stars (some real-life, some fictional characters).",/review/rw5705427/?ref_=tt_urv

16 March 2021,stephenchase-63504,10," The greatest cartoon with Scooby-Doo and Shaggy!!!!!!!!
","Voice work is updated, the characters are funny, and the actions are fresh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",/review/rw5705427/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2021,bm-69424,5," Okay Scooby-Doo
","Over the last few years Scooby-Doo has been very experimental. Be Cool Scooby-Doo, Mystery Incoporated, and even the failed one Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get A Clue still tried something new. However, SDAGW? Plays things safe which can hurt it at times because we know how good this gang can be when there pushed to there full potential. Some episodes are amazing like the Morgan Freeman, but others just fall flat. Pretty much a mixed bag of a Scooby series.",/review/rw5705427/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2019,hewittjack-06277,8," Back to the basics
","Revenge of the Swamp Monster, whilst containing obvious flaws, delivers a promising start to the series. With a focus on more visual humour, rather than offbeat and unusual from Be Cool Scooby (However do expect a zany punchline to be delivered here and there), and an old fashioned sense of score and narrative. Fingers crossed the rest of the season delivers on such a similar aura of nostalgic fun!",/review/rw5705427/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2020,julianmarku,9," A rough start that keeps getting better
",So it's no mystery that the first episode isn't exactly a crowd-pleaser. But if you can get passed that you will find a diamond in the rough with this reboot.,/review/rw5705427/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2019,meghanndotta,6," The great and not so great
","Really digging this new show in the Scooby world. Love the look and feel, with a great premise also. What's not so great? I can barely stand the new god  voice for Velma. I mean, in the category of nasally high pitched voices, this one causes ear bleeding. I miss the voice of Mindy Cohn.",/review/rw5705427/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2020,acarltoncooke,1," Not Up To Mystery Inc. Standards
","Mystery Inc. is a tough act to follow, as it is the best in the series since the original. Guess Who is a (reboot? Reimagining?) of The New Scooby-Doo movies from the 70s, so the concept isn't original. Add to that a ""softer"" drawing style, a brighter palette than Mystery Inc. (the characters were more angular and the colors were darker; the atmosphere was reminiscent of the original Scooby-Doo), and simplified stories (compared to the complex arc of Mystery Inc.), the experience just isn't memorable. It falls alongside other forgettable iterations (What's New?, etc.). That said, this is my opinion as an adult who grew up with the original, The New Scooby-Doo Movies, The Scooby-Doo Show, Scooby and Scrappy, and loved the fresh, serious take of Mystery Inc. so take it with a grain of salt. It seems that after Mystery Inc., they've decided to return to more of a kid friendly format; those who enjoy that will probably rate it higher.",/review/rw5705427/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2020,meghanndotta,6," It's not bad
",But dang....so hard to listen to this new voice they're using for Velma. Like nails on a chalkboard. Seriously missing Mindy Cohn. Bri g her back!!,/review/rw5705427/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2019,sunisfun-99372,10," This is FANTASTIC!!
","Can't wait for more!! My favorite series was be cool Scooby Doo but not many others felt the same way. It ended way too soon so I'm excited we have this one to look forward to. I'm glad even though they went back to the old style, they all still have cell phones and technology. I love the humor and sarcasm you didn't get in the much older series.",/review/rw5705427/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2021,svader,8," If it wasn't for Velma

11 August 2019,roweandrew,10," Love it!
","Scooby-Doo is my favorite cartoon, even have his dogtag tattooed on my wrist. This show does the original Scooby-Doo movies justice, I love it! Especially the intro it has the old Scooby-Doo feel to it. Can't wait for mor episodes!",/review/rw5705427/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2019,vallum-19275,8," For those who miss 'classic' Scooby-Doo
","A return to form for those who want their 'classic' scooby format back. It might not be the best of the best in the series, but is something a classic scooby fan would have missed since early 2000's/90's",/review/rw5705427/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2019,sandman-29895,10," The show really captures the style of the original.
",The animation is honestly amazing. The backgrounds and character designs are nostalgic. Episodes 2 and 4 really show the potential of the show.,/review/rw5705427/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2021,gothicdoometal,3," This seriously has 7.4?
",This show is just a bad joke and it all starts with the format of the show which crossovers the gank with celebrities. And if you thought Chris Paul was completely irrelevant with such a show you got even more stupid crossovers. Like Wonder woman. There's a point to the stupidity someone can take.,/review/rw5705427/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2022,jarretstroud,5," Mediocre
",I'm going to say it. I only watched season 1 of this series and I'm not a fan. While the animation is better then Be Cool Scooby Doo and the abomination of a series Shaggy and Scooby Get a Clue I still prefer Be Cool Scooby Doo over this. But this series is better then Get a Clue.,/review/rw5705427/?ref_=tt_urv
