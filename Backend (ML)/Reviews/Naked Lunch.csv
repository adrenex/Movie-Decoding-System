9 February 2021,fredwmeyer2,3," This series is all ""Tell, Don't Show""... and that's the problem.
","The concept of ""show, don't tell"" was completely lost on the writers room. Every character had to describe every other character as ""the best of the best"", ""the best the agency ever had"", ""the best I've ever seen"".",/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2021,littlesatanhooves,3," How I miss Ed Woodward
","I watched the 1st episode hoping to rekindle some of that magic from the 1985 TV series starring Edward Woodward. Everything about that series was stellar, including the electrifying theme music composed by ex-Police Stewart Copeland. Everything about this remake is the opposite. The plot's simplistic beyond credibility, the protagonist hardly finds herself in any life threatening situation, and because everything from point A to Z appears as contrived as a 10-piece jigsaw puzzle, there's no suspense to speak of. Sad. I had expected much more from this and from 'Clarice'. Thank goodness for WandaVision. My opinion is based on the first two episodes.",/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2021,phillip-henry,1," Incredibly poor but no surprise
","This series is like when David Moyes took over from Alex Ferguson, Ferguson was iconic as was Edward Woodward, I don't care that they have a woman playing the lead not just this lead woman, Queen Latifa is a decent actor but not for an action role like this
Everything about this is poor, some of the actors are good but the writers have made this a poor imitation of a once great show, I know I may be looking at this through hazy rose tinted glasses but even without the history it's objectively terrible.",/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2021,cdeanroane,2," Another unrealistic show for 2021
","Queen Latifah is totally miscast in this show. Add to that she playing a divorced mom trying to raise a kid., There was potential for a decent show but kid and he family drama ruins this show. Hopefully this will be s short lived show!",/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2021,kris-gray,1," Rubbish
","Some reviewers here think Denzel was the original Equalizer, not so, check out Edward Woodward, the original.",/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2021,spasek,4," CBS Misses Again With Another Remake
","The only thing I was waiting for was to see Oprah show up as Queen Latifah's sidekick. Now, I'm always willing to give just about anything a try and judge for myself if something is good or not. I've certainly watched enough movies and shows that weren't nearly as bad as other critics made them out to be. I've also watched enough movies and shows that weren't nearly as good either.",/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2021,pietclausen,2," This Equalizer ain't got it
","Disappointing series, lots of talking, very little action. In other words a meek show with no go!",/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2021,catfashionings-94332,2," Poorly cast, bad writing, annoyingly edited fight scenes.
",Queen Latifah is poorly cast in this role. She's just not believable as a skilled CIA agent. Also the writing is blah... absolutely zero nuance. You are directly told what pretty much every character's traits are.,/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2021,benchseat,2," Annoyingly Predictable.
",Queen L is a decent actress but this show is a waste of time and talents of her and Chris Noth. The original series with Edward Woodward was good. The films with Denzel were good. This incarnation is not. All the scenarios have been run. Don't waste your time. Update as of 5/23.... I am not surprised it was renewed for a season 2. Whoever is pushing this one has obviously not read the user reviews here. I only watch free streaming services now and don't waste my money for crap like this that I don't want to watch or help fund.,/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,LtlHippo,1," Laughable
","Really enjoy seeing Liza, enjoy her in everything she's in. But the rest of the cast...nooooooo. Queen and her hush hush voice, doing her karate chops pretending to be a vigilant is laughable. Not believable at all. Replace her and it would be a lot better show.",/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2022,bosporan,3," A poor parody polemic!
","An unconvincing travesty with nothing to recommend it. Lots of talking, more talking, rounded out by talking. When the action arrives it lacks any semblance of credibility, Queen Latifah is the wrong actress for this role, despite being good elsewhere.",/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2021,romanosdaniel,1," The last episode took this rating from 3 to 1
",I like Queen Latifah (she can at least act) but this show stretches plausibility far beyond belief.,/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2021,Herufied,1," Absolute rubbish
","I just wasted a half hour of my life, even though I knew I should have turned it off after seven. Absolute rubbish. Don't waste your time on this one.",/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2021,nielsenpete,1," Huge disappointment
",This was as terrible as Ashton jumping in for Charlie Sheen on 2 and half men.,/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2021,kuluvas-44265,1," Edward Woodward Hates all of you, I know I do.
","I didn't think they could make something worse than the new(moronic)macgyver but this takes the cake.... And eats all of it. This is getting bad, they'll be remaking little house on the prairie now but all Asian and in Afghanistan... This is just absolutely stupid. It actually gets -6000 stars but the rating doesn't go that low... At least macgyver is -5000.",/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2021,rwfanj,1," No...just no. Completely unbelievable & just bad.
","I decided I'd go ahead and stream the first two episodes...we're snowed in right now so I have plenty of time. I'm sorry I wasted the time. It's just not even worth watching! The fighting is unbelievable and is obviously fake..it's like a bad movie. Queen Latifah is an awesome actor but this role is too contrived for her, she doesn't come across as a former ""secret squirrel"" type and just not convincing. It's just a bit of a downer because she always does a good job. I was certainly expecting this ""reimagining"" of the series to have some of the same ""feel"" as the original, but it's just too forced.
It just tries too hard to make everything fit and like I said, it all feels too contrived. I don't see it getting the ratings it'll require to be renewed.",/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2021,a_apelqvist,1," Its bad.
","Its bad, really bad. Watch the series from -85 or the two movies with Denzel instead.",/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2021,j-93237,1," omg, cheesy and awkward isn't enough to describe this
",I did not believe any of the acting. it was just surreal.,/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,texasboyy,1," I'm still laughing
","I loved the original series and the Denzel Washington movies but when I first heard Latifah was taking over the role, I laughed so hard I spit soda across the room. And the commercials almost gave me seizures from laughing when I saw an old, overweight ex-rapper trying to be an action hero. But I gave the first episode a chance - and I'm still rolling on the floor laughing weeks later. Who thought casting her in the role was a good idea? Which producer sat there and said ""You know what? We need an out of shape celebrity few people remember to play the main character."" I'm a big fan of CBS shows, but this one is just too ludicrous to deal with.",/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2021,trevrex,4," Pretty Loudy
","This is just not good television. The jump cuts are annoying, there is no believability in Queen Latifah being a seasoned fighter, and even for a network procedural, the writing is generic and over-the-top-hammy at best.",/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2021,robert-alexander-617-384312,1," Don't Even DVR it
",Horrible writing; plots that make no sense; and unbelievable characters. Seriously can the shows spend the money for good writers? If they did I think would even help the poor acting and casting.,/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2021,movingwater,3," Get better writers!
",All the production values & screen talent can't save bad writing. The plots are canned and the writing is boring and cliche. More fun to watch turning off the sound and making up your own dialogue.,/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2022,glenno-42453,4," After 20 episodes, I'm done
","As much as I love Queen Latifah and the rest of her crew (except her annoying daughter), I just have to stop watching. I'm tired of being preached at instead of entertained. They got away from the original Equalizer concept.",/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2021,pmkenny,3," Just Awful
",I had a feeling this was going be terrible but not this bad!,/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2021,peekaboobaskets,1," I did not think anything could be this bad...
","I love ""The Equalizer"" TV series and the 2 excellent movies... this... this is not the Equalizer. It is like none of the writes - directors - people in the show saw the originals. It is very sad actually. Fight scenes that are chopped up - dialog that is lame - OVER dramatization of everyone...oh so-and-so is BEST of the BEST - and so-an-so is SO BEST of the BEST...Robert McCall never had to tell others he was BEST OF THE BEST or the people he worked with were BEST OF THE BEST... his action did it for him... when you have to be told every step of the way what you need to see or what you need to believe or what you need to know... there is something wrong.",/review/rw6585618/?ref_=tt_urv
