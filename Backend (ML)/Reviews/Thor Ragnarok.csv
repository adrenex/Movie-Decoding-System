","Do you know the feeling you get when you go into a film with no expectations at all or thinking it might be decent, and the film turns out to not only be good, but blows you away by how amazing it ends up being? That's LION, and if you've been watching films for several years like me thinking you've seen everything committed to cinema, it's a fantastic feeling to be proved wrong.",/review/rw3628928/?ref_=tt_urv

","'Lion' showed a lot of promise. There was potential for a very powerful story, had heard a lot of good things about it (as seen from many positive reviews and a high rating here) and there is a lot of talent involved. A lot of my friends had said how much it touched them, as have many reviewers here, and it seemed like my kind of film. ",/review/rw3628928/?ref_=tt_urv

","Whenever I wander in the streets of the Moroccan Medina, I feel at home. There's that strange mixture of various fragrances floating in the air: spices, kebab, frying delicacies (not much different from these appetizing jelabis), sea spray from the fish market, tanned leather from the shoe shop and this whole conglomerate smell outsiders or tourists might feel stinky, but as far as ""my"" senses are concerned, ""there's no place like home"".

","Missing child cases are ones that really do send a shiver down the spine, the uncertainty of the child's whereabouts or whether in fact they are actually still alive being the major worries. You can't possibly understand the effect it must have on a family. In Garth Davis' Lion, we see the effects of such a case on the child rather than the family left behind.

22 December 2016,CineMuseFilms,9," An immensely satisfying cinematic experience: visually stunning, narratively powerful, and an emotional whirlwind. Best Aussie film of the year.
","If film-art is the pursuit of visual pleasure, powerful storytelling and high emotional impact, then Lion (2016) is the year's high-water mark for Australian productions. Based on the novel A Long Way Home (2014), this film adaptation is a richly textured essay on the primal human need for belonging that will resonate with anyone who has ever wondered who they are.",/review/rw3628928/?ref_=tt_urv

Bad I know, but I can't watch a film with subtitles, it's a fault, but there you go, i fiddle with my phone or tablet etc, but the story was such that I didn't take my eyes off it.

My father told me that the nuns found me on the street, and they took me to an orphanage in Solur.

11 November 2016,apioneer,10," This Film has Oscars written all over it
","I had not read anything about this film and I went to see 'Lion' yesterday. I was moved, I was shocked. I had tears in my eyes and the hair on my skin stood up. I could listen to my own heart beats while watching this film. It has never happened to me before when I saw a film and I was touched immensely. The film took me back to my roots and streets where I grew up. I am from Pakistan and I have been living in San Francisco for the last 15 years. I come from that part of the world where this story takes place. I grew up in streets like the streets of the movie 'Lion'. I have met many children who collect garbage to make a living and are lost in the streets of this universe. They sleep alone on card board boxes at night and when you look at them , there is a question in their eyes. The world has forgotten about these children and there are thousands of these children on the streets of India and Pakistan. Do you really know what it feels like when you are only 5 years old and lost in some crowded street in a big city and do not know how to get home? To the boy who played Saroo (Sunny Pawar), I want to give you an Academy Award. The film grabs you from the beginning as it starts out with showing a beautiful relationship between two brothers who are running on a train track. The actress who played mother (Priyanka Bose)touched my heart. Her performance is breathtaking. The way she looks at her sons, shows you how a mother pours her heart with love when she looks at her children. There are no words to express that feeling and actress gave her full self and emotions to play this role from young to old. It is commendable and her acting moved me and reminded me of my own mother. There are so many things which I think my mother does not know about me but the way she looks at me, I know she knows. ",/review/rw3628928/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2017,claudio_carvalho,8," Great Film Based on a True Story
","In 1986, in Khandwa, India, the 5 year-old boy Saroo (Sunny Pawar) lives a very poor but happy life with his mother Kamla (Priyanka Bose), his older brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) and his younger sister Shekila (Khushi Solanki). Kamla works carrying stones during the night shift and Guddu also works in the night in the Central Station. One night, Saroo insists on going with Guddu to his work and does not resist and sleeps. Guddu leaves Saroo sleeping on a bank I the station and asks him to stay there until he returns. However the boy wakes up in the middle of the night and decides to seek out his brother in a train. He sleeps again and he wakes up in Calcutta, West Bengal, and 1,600 km east of Khandwa. Saroo does not speak Bengali, only Hindi, and lives on the street of the big city. One day, a young man brings Saroo to the police station and he is sent of an institution for children. In 1987, Saroo is adopted by an Australian family and moves to Hobart, Tasmania. He is raised with love by his foster parents and one day, he goes to an Indian party promoted by his Indian mates from the university with his girlfriend Lucy (Rooney Mara). He tells the story of his childhood and triggers the feeling of missing his family. Now Saroo becomes obsessed to find his mother Kamla and his siblings. Will he succeed in his search?",/review/rw3628928/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2017,MOscarbradley,7," Intelligent and moving
","""Lion"" is the kind of inspirational movie I normally shy away from but first-time director Garth Davis treats the material with a harder edge than I expected. The potential for sentimentality is, of course, high in this true story of a five year old Indian boy separated from his family by 1600 kilometers when the train he is sleeping in 'accidentally' takes him to Calcutta forcing him to live on the streets until a kindly Australian couple, (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham), adopt him and raise him to adulthood in Tasmania.",/review/rw3628928/?ref_=tt_urv

","WOW! What an epic movie and true life to boot. How this did not win any Oscars is beyond me. Such emotion that all the actors portrayed. Heart wrenching scenes, make sure you have tissues close at hand; you will need them several times throughout the movie. Then the ending, is there such a thing as a happy gut punch?

","Just saw this at TIFF . I saw the trailer a few days before the screening and I have to admit the trailer alone made me a little emotional. I mean just the thought of a 5 year old separated from his family for 25 years is bad enough, add in the fact that he was lost in India, a country of over a billion people and was the child of an uneducated poor single mother and you are looking at a very stressful situation.",/review/rw3628928/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2016,bibo-93638,9," A movie with a soul of its own
","To put it in simple words, ""Lion"" is a journey that grabs you entirely ; whether you want it or not, you are a part of each and every scene. Exactly like the hero, you find yourself having visions of a past that you think you have forgotten, you long for something more and you dig for something deeper. This is a journey back home, filled with emotions, hard decisions, and an infinite willingness to reach somewhere safe.. Simple story, dream like sequences and real characters that are aware that ""there are no white pages"" but that in a way, there is always a black ink somewhere that you can use to finish the endless books that you have in your head. A gem and must see. Highly recommended for the cast's performances, the musical score and the emotional layer that refuses to let you go even after the movie had ended.",/review/rw3628928/?ref_=tt_urv

","As tragic as is the fate of the young boy Saroo (Sunny Pawar) at the beginning of the story, I was struck by the magnitude of missing children annually in India noted at the end of the film - eighty thousand! One wonders how that could even be possible. The scene that really got me was when Saroo asked Mrs. Sood the question in my summary line above. It was as if he knew that no one really tried, though in a country of over a billion people and being almost a thousand miles from home, the odds approximated the proverbial needle in a haystack.",/review/rw3628928/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2017,bbewnylorac,7," Good, but could have been great
","The gorgeous cinematography in India, and the astonishingly natural performance of little Sunny Pawar as the lost child Saroo, are worth the price of admission to Lion. As others have said here, the second half of the film, set in Australia, is a let-down. It's almost like another film. In India, Priyanka Bose is fantastic playing Saroo's desperately poor yet very loving and dignified mother, Kamla. And special mention to Abhishek Barate, as Saroo's much loved big brother Guddu, who does his best to work, with Saroo, to scrounge coal from trains to buy food for their family. Guddu might be a thief and a hustler, but he's so loving and affectionate. Barate brings a lot of heart to his scenes and has great chemistry with the child. The scenes where Saroo gets lost, alone, on a cross country train and later in the streets of Calcutta, are beautifully shot, and not excessive in scripting or soundtrack. The child Saroo is not overly cute or streetwise; but he has just enough luck and instinct to survive - I love the scene where he sneaks in to an outdoor shrine at night and steals some food offerings (after making the prayer sign) while everyone is sleeping. When he arrives in Tasmania and meets his new adoptive parents, the Brierleys, (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham) I got the feeling they had no idea what Saroo had gone through, which they couldn't have. And the Brierleys' second adopted son, also an Indian orphan, is even more traumatised, although we never find out what his story is. But once we switch to the adult Saroo, the movie almost comes to a halt in its pacing. Dev Patel is quite good as adult Saroo, (although to me he doesn't resemble the boy Saroo), and his Australian accent is great. The trouble, I think, is the script, which is overly angsty, at the expense of advancing the plot. For Saroo to find an obscure village in India, using just his childhood memories and Google Earth, is a thrilling idea, but it's not well portrayed in the movie. For too many scenes, Saroo simply surfs the online maps, or moves pins around a paper map, but mostly he gets angry and frustrated and morose in his flat. And then one day, as though guided by a supernatural force, his computer mouse is directed to an obscure region of India, and in a few seconds, he's found his family home. I find this unbelievable. Maybe in real life he discovered things bit by bit, and that was impossible to portray on film? The search could have been portrayed in a more diverse way. Didn't he ask around at the orphanage he was brought to as a child? Weren't there some language and cultural clues he could have asked people about? Even the food. Couldn't he have brainstormed with his Indian student friends in Melbourne? Instead, Saroo is portrayed as working alone, and as mostly looking for the water tower that as a child he saw next to a railway station. But as a friend points out, there are many water towers in India near railway stations. Possibly thousands? The character of Saroo's love interest, Lucy (Rooney Mara), comes across as unnecessary and her scenes with Saroo are far too uninteresting. Lion is not a love story - it's the story of a lost child. Ditto Nicole Kidman's scenes. She's not bad, but she's not the focus of the film and she gets too much screen time. So to me, it's a respectable film, but falls short of excellent.",/review/rw3628928/?ref_=tt_urv
