27 November 2021,lava-75273,1," Trying way too hard
","I was soooo looking forward to this reboot because I grew up watching the original. This just tries wayyyy too hard to be woke and politically correct. I'm a person of color and found the constant making fun of white people ridiculous and offensive. Content like this serves no purpose, but making the racial divide in this country worse. What a complete disappointment and waste of time.",/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2020,CriticsVoiceVideo,1," Makes the original look like Othello.
",It's trash. Not funny. Stupid dialogue. Bad acting. Manages to be more corny than the original and the comedy writing is already dated. Avoid! This is my third review because they keep getting rejected. Hmmm...I wonder why.,/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2020,KOOLAIDBRO,10," Bruh..... What are some of you doing?
","This is like a 8, but I'm trying to offset the silly 1 star reviews that missed the entire point that this is making fun of the original show for ever existing and allowing some of the things that happened in them. Re-watch the original sometime and if you still think it's good? May God have mercy on your black soul. So if you take new series serious? Wtf are you doing with your life? This is satire and I laughed almost immediately at the kid reading the book upside-down because he was learning about Australia. That's the kind of stupidity they did in the original and it was stupid then. Guess what? It's straight up cringe today. Hence the premise of some of this show is poking fun at the old and giving a shoutout to it all at once. The longer I watched the funnier the new cast became and it became all at once. If you are closed minded and can't let someone live their own life and be who they want? You're not going to like this. If you don't know that sometimes people try to be progressive and fail miserably? You're not going to like this show. It's a shame because I even laughed out loud a few times and I'm not easy to please with humor. If you can be bigger and open minded? ENJOY.",/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2020,kopower,8," The people giving 1 star just don't get it.
",This show isn't meant to be the same as the original. It's more satirical and introspective. It makes fun of how ridiculous the plot and storylines were while laughing at itself for even exists.,/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2022,BobN4Apples,2," More woke drivel
","More woke drivel. It's like the reboot was spawned for the sole purpose of mocking and apologizing for the original version of the show, which is ridiculous because the original version had nothing to apologize for. It was a silly and fun tween/teen sitcom. Hollywood needs to stop this BS. It does nothing but stoke the problems that it purports to help.",/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2021,Ppalmiotto,1," What in the eve living heck?
","Nope, nope, nope, and nope. Made it only 13 mins in, pokes fun, yes but in a mean way. Acting was bad, characters just seem like the show is trying a little too hard to be something, but that something is bad, very bad.",/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2020,arod_85,7," Painfully bad yet I love every nostalgic minute of it!
","This show is bad, the acting, most of the characters, the storylines, the humor, the attempt to tactile political issues. All terrible! But strangely enough, it's enjoyable and I can't wait for season 2. It does have a different feel than the original but seeing the original characters integrated with the new generation is awesome! Love AC Slater and I'm glad he is a main cast member and not a reoccurring character. His original dance off scene was awkward and a great nod to all of us 80s- 90s kids obsessed with SBTB. AC still looks great 30 years later...",/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2020,Craigelink,7," Better than expected
","Look guys, the original premise of this series was over the top cheesiness and that worked in the early 90's. It won't work today so I love the tongue in cheek way that this reboot pokes fun at itself and the original series whilst still being enjoyable. I liked the original as a kid and I don't mind this as an adult. It's not groundbreaking or amazing but it's different and watchable and I was able to easily watch the first series with a fair amount of enjoyment. Can't ask much more in a netflix based world",/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,mutum-378-411645,5," Not my thing
",I've always loved the original series and the college years series that followed. Sadly this new series is too modern and cool for me. However I'm 38 now so let's face it I'm not the target market for this show. I'll stick with the originals.,/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2020,ayameofazuma,2," Disney-like, terrible, boring
","I didn't expect too much, but this show is just bad. I grew up on the original and I admit that watching it now is pretty corny, but it's still fun. This reboot is just painful. I know times are very different now, but it's just like those terrible Disney teen shows. So maybe it's an ok show for today's teens. But for me it's painful and unwatchable. The acting is terrible.",/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2021,supernatural-62-813086,8," Absolutely Brilliant
",Loved the first Season and I can't believe it but the 2nd season is even better.,/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2020,HappyChildOfGod,1," Wasn't worth the waiting :(
","I was so exited about this. As a fan of the original series, this is... so disappointing. Not funny, not interesting. Boring. Couldn't make it past episode 2, got bored.",/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2020,cjandt,10," So funny similar to ""Not another teen movie""
",Either you get the jabs or dont. Its meant to be different and make fun of the norm 90s sitcom. My 14 year old watched all the OG with me even (unfortuneatly) the colege years. He likes this better than the original. Wouldnt go that far as I loved that era but for this era totally can see it. You almost have to watch it twice to get all the jokes. Brilliant. Sorry I thought it was great. By the way Not another teen movie was totally underrated. If you liked it you woll love this. Watched again layers of jokes. Just love it,/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2020,LiiaPantz,10," Hilarious - Ignore the Haters
","Some reviewers really just don't get that this show is satirical of the original, and they don't get the jokes.
It is SO FUNNY and if you want to hate something just because ""there's too many remakes"" or it's not serious enough, then I guess it's not for you.",/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2021,ajworden-54648,10," If you don't get it don't watch it...
",I'm 53 and watch some of the original series. It was all right but a bit to cheesy for me... The show has cheese to but with a bit of real life throne in. The stories are fast and the acting is great... I'm ill after an operation. This show was a real escape form my pain and discomfort.,/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2022,Gilmoregirl-59340,10," Thirty something who can't stop laughing!
","I didn't watch the original show, but heard the reboot was great. I'm in my early 30's and my husband and I burst out laughing countless times throughout each episode. The nostalgia part isn't applicable to us, but the writing in this show makes it so enjoyable. It's great to be able to shut off your brain and escape with comedy.",/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2021,Filmiarvustus,5," Not the reboot we wanted, but a reboot we deserve
","""Saved by the Bell"" returns 31 years later to reflect youth problems once again, but times have changed and so has the TV show. In Season 1 Zack Morris is now a governor and brings together local high and low-income schools, creating a polarizing environment, where inequality in class, gender, and race are brought to attention. It might be a little too woke, but the added nostalgia from the original cast and that the show is actually being funny, awkward and cheesy, makes it worthwhile entertainment. Hopefully ""Saved by Bell"" is here to stay.",/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2020,j_co,6," Fun watch, It should be treated as a parody
","Yes, the acting could be better, and the story lines are predictable, but the original was just as bad, so people complaining this one is not a masterpiece is not fair.",/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2022,katy344,7," I like it and I think a lot of people have missed the point ... !
","I loved the original series - it was a staple of my teenage TV schedule! I put off watching the reboot as I expected it to be rubbish but I was surprised to find I quite like it. I think a lot of people are missing the point that it's taking the mick out of itself and the original though. That's what I like about it. Also it's meant to be silly, it always was!",/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2020,decarloj,10," Never judge a book by it's cover
","I made the mistake of prematurely judging Cobra Kai before it aired thinking it was going to be terrible, but it turned out to be a great series. Well the same goes for this show. I binged all ten episodes. It was pretty much a modern day version of Clueless with some Saved by the Bell throwbacks. It was about getting old, staying young, and growing as a person. They poked some fun at woke culture, and delved into some current issues without throwing it in your face. It's just a shame it isn't on a bigger platform and won't get the wide audience it deserves.",/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2020,afijamesy2k,1," A Ridiculous reboot of a not so good tv show
","This is a useless pathetic and truly dreadful reboot of saved by the bell, the original was never a masterpiece theater to begin and this reboot of the series is even worse, really bad acting, truly poor plots, dreadful teleplay, mario lopez, mark paul gosselaar and the rest of them are completely terrible, pathetic sight gags and really poorly done.
The series centers around a new group of Bayside High students from ""overprivileged"" and working-class families, among the latter of which were transferred to the school as part of a plan by now-California Governor Zack Morris-whose administration experiences controversy for closing too many low-income high schools-to send lower-income students to the highest-performing schools
and for what else, nothing.
this is a truly, truly dreadful reboot of a cheesy classic, even the theme song is a disaster as well, what the hell is this, this is a truly miserable experience that earns a spot on my list of the worst tv of 2020 and one of the worst tv shows of the decade, oh i can't wait until punky brewster gets a much better reboot, because this one is total junk period, just typical trash",/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2020,vukaroo,1," We've Gone To An Alternate Reality
","This is if Zack from yesteryear had one of his dreams in which everything was upside down, inside out and basically like hell. What's even worse is that the experience of watching it is like swimming in a cesspool of vapidness, synonymous with our times. It's a parody of a parody, constantly reminding you that any semblance of intelligence and hope is rapidly fading, allowing for a straight dive into a seemingly inevitable ""zombie apocalypse.""",/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2021,booksnbooks-12338,7," One thing I love about it
","They showcase that not everyone in California is is living ""The California Dream"" which is actually just a marketing slogan if you're a California resident.",/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2021,kateorgan,2," Sigh!!!!
","Ok so it's not the original we all know that and it was never going to be!!!!
I loved the old ones and that was corny but this feels so forced and is filmed so strange it really feels like the old cast needed money so used the saved by the bell name, I only watched the new one because of my Miss 10 year old but she even said it's lame! She is now watching the old ones saying they are so much better and funnier too!",/review/rw6311438/?ref_=tt_urv
