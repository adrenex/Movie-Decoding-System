",Thanks to Sci-fi and the Henson Company for this wonderful contribution to the TV science fiction canon.,/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2001,Ripe Peach,," Annoyingly enjoyable
","I watched about ten minutes of each of a couple of series 1 Farscape episodes and hated it.  Cliched plots, characters blatantly lifted from other shows, and *muppets*.  Might as well watch the Phantom Menace.",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2006,chrichtonsworld,10," One of the best experiences of my life
","Thanks to the BBC I was introduced to this extremely wonderful and epic show! This show had everything, humor,action,thrills,great characters and the best drama! Now you may think I am not being objective,but when it comes to movies and TV shows I can be very critical! For me an excellent series is a show I can watch over and over again without getting bored! Let me tell you,there are not many shows who are able to do that! Farscape manages to do so with ease. I think there are many reasons why this show is great! 1). The combination of CGI and Jim Henson's Creature shop muppetry give the show a look never seen before. ",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2004,dunnmountain,," Loved it, want it back!!
","It took me a short while to get into this show. I find that most people who don't like it, just don't GET it. Farscape is a deep and intense show with a lot of small twists and turns in a very complicated plot. It is NOT a show you could watch one or two episodes of and know what was going on. They do a great job with the meager budget they work with and create a very livable ""viable"" view of the far and distance universe taking the level up above Star Trek or Star Wars. Probably my favorite show of all time, and well worth the time it takes to understand what's happening.",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2012,Tweekums,10," A great sci-fi series
","When I first saw a trailer announcing that a new science fiction series created by Jim Henson and featuring some of his puppets I thought it would be some sort of light hearted 'Muppets in Space' aimed at younger viewers... how wrong I was! There may be plenty of light hearted moments, especially early on, but there are some very dark ones too.",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 1999,Ernie-17,," The best original science fiction I've seen in a great while.
","This has got to be without a doubt, the best original science fiction show I've seen in a long time. I had rather high hopes for seaQuest (written by Rockne S. O'Bannon as well), and was disappointed. My first impressions of ""Farscape"" were ""Voyager"" / ""Battlestar Galactica"" clone, but that lasted about five minutes. I think my favorite characters are probably Pilot and Moya herself, although Aeryn is a close third. I do wonder that everyone frequently defers to John's leadership since he is brand new to the situation (not to mention that area of space) and seemingly does not understand even the basics of Leviathan tech.",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2005,gkpedersen,10," WOW, can't even start to cover FARSCAPE!!
","I had heard from other people that Farscape was good, so when I had the opportunity to watch the two final episodes in the whole series, I took it, and I haven't regret it since. I only regret, that I took me so long to discover the BEST SCI-FI Series on EARTH. (It will be difficult to beat this one). By watching these episodes, it made me want to know what had happen prior to the final, how it all had started, I just wanted more of the same.",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2018,XweAponX,10," Really needed a 5th Season
","Every show I like starts off with what could be termed ""MOTW""- Monster of the week episodes, and Farscape is no different than The X Files in that regard. In fact, my favorite seasons of both X Files and Farscape are its 1st seasons.",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2013,SnoopyStyle,8," great look from Jim Henson Production
",Nasa astronaut John Crichton (Ben Browder) gets caught in a wormhole and travels to the far side of the universe. He joins with a group of escaped prisoners on board a living spaceship.,/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2005,landscapelady,," Incredibly smart
","This show is one of the few out there that has layers upon layers for the viewers to enjoy. Well written and incredibly addictive this show takes you away and keeps you there. The characters draw you in from the begin episode, but also allow you to jump in at anytime. There is never a moment when they are not evolving into more complex beings. The challenge that many shows face is continuing the development of the show while not losing the initial concept. Farscape smashes this theory into pieces as it evolves and provides the viewer with challenging action, and sometimes even killing off well loved characters. This show should have never been canceled. It was a rare gem.",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2019,theknownames,10," Season 1
","I have always slept-in until forced to wake up in the morning, but for a couple of weeks now, I have been waking up early every day, just to watch part of an episode over coffee . I 'got through' the first episode, because it's an older show . I liked the premise and was interested in things to come. Then it just kept getting better and better. I am so glad that I watched this from the beginning since episodes are sequenced , the show builds and there are references. Only two episodes out of 22 weren't great , two! The reviewer who said this show is more than it appears to be was right. It is!
I am up early again this morning looking foreword to season two!",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2004,bschober,," Talk about raising the bar!
","It just doesn't get better than this. Farscape is easily one of the best series to ever grace the TV screen. Even if you're not a regular sci-fi fan, it's nearly impossible to not enjoy the intelligence, wit, superb acting, and sheer beauty of each episode. I used to think that Joss Whedon had the market on pop-culture fantasy pretty much cornered, but Farscape raises the bar even higher in terms of its characterization and integral humanity.",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2009,Adrian Sweeney,10," The best SF show ever, and one of the best TV shows, full stop
","Most episodes of Farscape had a single writing credit, but here's how I think they were really written: Half a dozen geniuses in a room have fun writing a script together to the best of their ability. When they're done, they lock themselves in there for a further week and take it apart line by line, constantly asking, 'How can we do this better? How can we do this different? How can we put an original spin on this?' They do this until it's no longer fun and they hate each other. When they break through that and they're in love again they go back once more and really have fun putting humour and sick stuff in.",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2004,hardbop,," Perhaps the best sci-fi series ever filmed for TV
",Farscape is not the easiest series to get into. You really need to see it from the beginning which is probably one of the reasons the ratings were not that great when it aired on the Sci-Fi Channel.,/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2004,slohmann,," First class SciFi entertainment
","Saw it and liked it from the first episode on. The German translation is not recommendable but the original is really a great piece of work (art), a fact, which was unfortunately not noticed by the TV-channel SciFi. If you like creative, witty and funny entertainment you will love FARSCAPE! The Jim Henson company brought in all their resources and skills to create a completely strange, alien world on your TV-screen. The overall plot is somehow old-fashioned but the ingredients of this SciFi-opera are superb. Different styles and types of movie-making have been mixed to create a very addictive show. Characters and types of creatures are worked out very carefully. The plot is unforeseeable and very varied, so you never get bored.",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2019,JustBe333,10," My absolute favorite sci-if show
","Just cheesy enough to keep it fun and entertaining and make you laugh n chuckle. Just serious enough to keep you into care-mode, and take it seriously when it asks for it.
The characters are fun and intriguing. You laugh with them frown with them cry with them and just enjoy when they all get their spotlights.
My favorite eco-fin'villan' of all time SCORPIUS.
My favorite episode into the lions den part 2 for drama, fav. For comedy Constellation of Doubt.
And THANK GOD they did a 2 part movie to wrap the show up after the massive cliff hanger on the last series.
I cannot recommend this show higher for a sci-fi fan who loves a lil good cheese. Will probably always be my favorite show",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2021,mladen982,10," There is Farscape and then there are all other space operas
","This is my favorite show ever. I think its the best Sci-Fi show ever made. Its serious one moment, dramatic the next, then its weird then its funny then there is action and it goes round and round. And its not just all thrown in randomly, stories themselves are great unique spin on typical Sci-Fi tropes. Acting is great and chemistry between characters is real. Its completely unique and original, no other show is like it. Guardians of the Galaxy tried to ripoff this show essence but its a corporate fake soulless take on Farscape. 4 seasons + mini series rounds it up perfectly, even if I as most would love it to last longer. If it overstated its welcome it may got bad or dragged too long. I hope they don't try to touch this in a remake or continuation because as it is its a perfect piece of Sci-Fi history that shows what can be created with creative people given tools to do what they want.",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2018,Trupiaar,10," Just WOW! Still Great!
","I am rewatching Farscape after probably over ten years, and it is still an amazing show! I rarely enjoy rewatching shows because I feel like most the surprises are spoiled, but Farscape still seems fresh and cracks me up!",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2007,spike06,9," I n a word: Brilliant! Be swept along on a visceral intelligent beautiful & (dare I say it) meaty ride!
","After completing disc two of season 3, I just can't contain my excitement any longer. Scifi fans and fans of great television take note, Farscape goes from strength to strength progressively getting bigger, better, glossier and meatier with every passing episode. ",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2004,thirdi,," Science Fiction or not, truly a show to behold
","I was never a huge fan of the sci fi that was on TV. I caught the random episode of the original Star Trek from time to time, and there were certainly the days of Buck Rogers and Battlestar as a kid. But I never got into any of the numerous Star Trek spin-offs, or the dozens of similar series. The only Sci Fi I really watched on a regular basis as an adult was The X Files. And then came Farscape.",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2007,ScreamerMM,9," Farscape, the best sci-fi show ever created!
","I am a die hard science fiction fan. I mean really, i read it i watch it i even listen to the theme songs. The Farscape series and the finishing mini series is the absolutely best science fiction show i have ever seen. The show only aired very shortly on cable TV here in Denmark, so i bought all of the episodes on DVD.",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv

7 September 2017,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,9," The Muppets Meets Star Trek With Trace Elements of Star Wars.
","FarScape has rightfully become a cult-classic TV series: it's a space-opera filled with puppets from Jim Henson's Creature Shop, and a colourful cast of humans, aliens and sentient starships. FarScape seems like several other scifi properties before it, but its use of puppetry interacting with the actors is still unsurpassed in television. The main guy is John Crichton, an astronaut who accidentally teleports to another part of the universe, in his namesake ship 'FarScape': and this poor guy is struggling to find his way back home. It's like if Jim Henson decided to take the premise of Lost in Space and added modern science fiction twists and tropes to the story, making it more accessible for modern audiences and broadening its appeal.",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2016,imzadi76,10," Can I get a ""Hell, yeah!""?
","Either you love Farscape or you hate it. I don't think there is anything between. I love it and even after more than 15 years it's still one of my favorite shows for many reasons and I re-watch like every two years. Farscape is absolutely crazy, smart, sexy, funny and heartbreaking. There are no resets with the shows. Characters grow, they change and evolve. Actions have consequences and when you think you have seen everything in the genre Farscape does something new. ",/review/rw3609862/?ref_=tt_urv
