28 September 2021,Jeremy_Urquhart,7," Don't expect a thriller; it's a very subdued drama, but quite a good one
","It's impressive how this movie is so low key and just shows what is likely a very ordinary day for the protagonist, yet still remains interesting and unnerving to watch. Entertaining might not be the best word to describe it, but neither is boring. It maintains a sense of quiet discomfort throughout, and the apathy of a toxic workplace and predatory behaviour of the higher-ups is explored extremely well with this stripped down, non-heightened approach.",/review/rw5688883/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2020,TxMike,," Character study, a young assistant in the New York entertainment empire.
","I can see why some viewers don't like this movie, there is no action, essentially no background music until the very end, and the focus is squarely on this young assistant who has been in the job for 5 weeks after graduating from a good college. Her ambition is to work her way into being a Producer.",/review/rw5688883/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2020,erzbetwilson,10," My life
","This was my life for 5 years in my 20s. Dreadful and boring; being treated like complete crap by anyone in positions of authority save a few people, being ignored, asked to smile more, dress more or less sexy, catcalled, and asked to do things that were morally wrong for myself. So I relate to this movie. Some may find it boring but if you've worked in a toxic environment whether your male or female you'll see similarities that aren't always picked up on. Brilliantly done.",/review/rw5688883/?ref_=tt_urv

11 September 2020,matthewssilverhammer,8," Hit me like a horror film...
","...only without the comfort of exaggeration or fantasy. Green employs exquisite camera composition to make the drab office environments a thing of sterile beauty, while Garner controls every uncomfortable on-screen moment with brilliantly still misery. Dehumanizing phone calls, oppressive mundanity, hopeless sexism. It's a painstakingly meticulous view into the soul-crushing work of the assistant to the powerful, especially when the roles are this cliched: man over woman.",/review/rw5688883/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2021,kosmasp,7," Mundane and detailed
","Let's just say, that whoever did this, has experience when it comes to the life of an assistant. There is nothing fancy here and the ticks and tocks are subtle and not in your face. The life of an Assistant is not glamouros (in realityt that is and in the way it is depicted here) - this could easily be a documentary then.",/review/rw5688883/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2020,rockman182,7," The Assistant (2020)
","I didn't know much about this film until mid last week. I ended up attending the show with a Q and A after the movie with writer and director, Kitty Green. Here is a filmmaker who I don't really know anything about but I was already a fan of Julia Garner. I really liked her on The Americans and knew she was going to blow up soon. She is fantastic in this minimalist performance about a timely and important issue that is ever present in modern times.",/review/rw5688883/?ref_=tt_urv

Watch as she almost scrambles when the usual driver can't pick her boss up. Watch as she makes more copies. Watch as she heats a TV dinner... every second that it's in the microwave... I wish I was kidding. I've worked on over 60 films and spent a lot of time working in production offices. This has to the absolute dullest film on the subject I've ever seen. The lead appears to have some talent, but she's allowed exactly one note (Okay, maybe one and a half). Watch as she plays that extra half of a note, on an impromptu visit to HR.

6 February 2020,subxerogravity,6," It's like a movie Version of click bait.
","Does that seem unfair? Cause technically a blockbuster is click bait, right!? Not really. It's obvious what this movie was trying to do and they delivered it in the most mundane way possible. Just like click bait, they lore you in with a topic you would enjoy but stretch out that topic till get gets boring.
I'm sorry I wanted to like this movie and I'm most likely not woke enough to like this movie but it's made for a niche market to get and I feel like I'm not part of that niche.",/review/rw5688883/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2020,apryla-58795,10," Gaslighting at its finest
","Whoo Boy! Was this one a doozy! A total punch in the gut that should be required watching for anyone really but more specifically young people starting out - especially those going into the film business. Too many have stars in their eyes with visions of nothing but positive outcomes guaranteed when the reality is anything but. And my God does it show the sexism that pervades offices everywhere. The main character is picking up after everyone, they walk all over her, disrespect her, and basically look right past her. She's invisible. No one cares about her. The worst part she is forced to apologize to her despicable boss who is nothing more than a skeezy predator in a glass tower. I get that this was supposed to be an interpretation of the whole Weinstein thing but this kind of stuff happens every day all over the world.",/review/rw5688883/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2021,jboothmillard,6," The Assistant
","I wouldn't have heard about this film if it wasn't for the latest edition of the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so obviously I became interested in watching it. Basically, Jane (Julia Garner) has been working as a junior assistant at a film production company in New York City for five weeks. Jane arrives early in the morning and performs various menial administrative tasks. This includes endless paperwork, bringing coffees, letters, and paperwork to others, and answering phone call complaints and enquiries. She is constantly busy with long hours and demanding tasks, causing her incredible stress. One day, she receives a call from her mother (Heather MacRae) reminding her that she forgot to call her father (Mark Jacoby) for his birthday. As the day goes on, Jane becomes suspicious of the company boss, referred to only as ""he"" or ""him"", who has been making sexual advances to many younger women at the office, and a culture of sexual harassment has been facilitated at the company. Many of the male executives make snide comments about the boss's affairs while the female workers handle their own work and talk about possibly transferring to other departments. Whenever Jane does something wrong, according to her boss, he verbally abuses her over the phone while he two male junior assistant co-workers (Jon Orsini and Noah Robbins) watch in silence. Throughout the day, various people from the boss's personal life interact with Jane, including his wife (St√©phanye Dussud), his children's nanny, and a group of Chinese film producers. Besides her stressful job, Jane has ambitions to become an actress, and attends script readings and auditions, and has occasional encounters with famous actors (including a cameo from Patrick Wilson). In the afternoon, young, inexperienced Sienna (Kristine Froseth) arrives from Idaho, saying she has been offered a job as a junior assistant. Jane, concerned for Sienna's well-being, goes to the human resources department to file a report after dropping Sienna off at a five-star hotel being paid for by the company. Wilcock (Matthew Macfadyen), the head of HR, encourages Jane to share her concerns, but later changes his mind and turns a blind eye to the harassment claims, speaking down to her. He says to Jane that she is jealous and discloses that filing a formal complaint would destroy her career. As Jane leaves his office, he reminds her that she has nothing to worry about, as Jane is not the boss's ""type"". Jane is upset, then returning to her desk receives a call from her boss, who has been informed about the unfiled report. He demands Jane write an email apology addressed to him, which she does. He replies saying that he is especially hard on Jane because he knows how great she is. Toward the end of the day, Janes teaches Sienna how to use the office phone systems. When it gets dark, Jane prepares a microwave dinner for herself while other employees leave. The boss stays late in his office with a young actress. He calls Jane on the intercom and tells her to go home. Jane goes to a coffee shop across the street and calls her father as she eats a muffin. After she hangs up, she sees a silhouette in her boss's window appearing to have sex. Also starring Makenzie Leigh as Ruby, Dagmara Dominczyk as Ellen, and Tony Torn as Boss. Garner gives a good, subdued performance as the assistant of the title, and Macfadyen makes an impression (with an impressive American accent) as the HR head. You could argue that nothing really happens throughout the film, but that seems to be the point, it is what you don't see going on that is the unseen focus. In the wake of the sentencing of disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and the ""Me Too"" movement, confronting Hollywood's long-ignored problems of sexual harassment, the script cleverly covers what goes on behind closed doors with monotonous email apologies, disingenuous phone calls and secretarial chores, making a quietly powerful fictionalised version of what we know now, an odd but interesting drama. Good!",/review/rw5688883/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2020,MOscarbradley,8," Deeply unsettling and unlike any other movie you will see on sexual abuse.
","Following on from the Harvey Weinstien scandal and other instances of sexual abuse and harrassment by the rich and powerful I'm sure movies like ""The Assistant"" are going to become more common place but I doubt if many of them will be this strange, this unsettling or indeed this good. Although fiction, ""The Assistant"" looks and feels like it could be a documentary and Kitty Green, whose first feature this is, does indeed come from a documentary background.",/review/rw5688883/?ref_=tt_urv

24 August 2020,wildsagedesign,10," A woman's equivalent perspective
",This is raw. Real. Disgraceful. A beautifully masterpiece of a woman 'trying to make a living and succeed In a mans world to be pushed under a mans thumb with disgust'. Almost painful to watch. The film gives the feeling like the events took place in an older time. The phones and headsets. The old school mentality. But this still happens now. I have been Jane. I have been the 'waitress' in the cab. I have been all of these 'belittled' characters. I feel a little empty from watching this and want to make a change for woman.,/review/rw5688883/?ref_=tt_urv

22 August 2020,classicsoncall,7," ""Don't worry. You're not his type.""
","In the early going, I knew right away this film would not appeal to a lot of viewers. It starts out slowly and never really revs up to any speed, however I did find the idea of the story compelling and provocative. As a newly hired assistant in a production office, Jane (Julia Garner) is not much more than a cog in an impersonal machine, handling menial assignments that come with the territory. There's almost the feeling that she keeps busy with tasks that she doesn't even have to do, like emptying the trash and babysitting the kids of her boss's nanny. Throughout there are hints that the 'boss', who's rarely if ever seen, is a serial womanizer who treats all of his employees with contempt. An attempt to level the playing field between herself and a brand new hire by visiting personnel results in Jane being subtly admonished to mind her own business if she wishes to remain employed.",/review/rw5688883/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2020,mcvmunro,10," Excellent quiet portrait of young naive girl trying to do the right thing.
","""The Assistant"" was very effective on showing what a person on the very bottom of the corporate structure (or the film culture) faces, the risks involved, the potential to harm to their own career, and how overwhelmingly difficult is to achieve any success to have anybody do anything about harm being done to another person, or point out that the person is being exploited. The idea of being a whistle blower when you're on the bottom of the food chain. It did a great job of identifying and exposing those very real risks and intimidation tactics that these kind of people have to deal with.",/review/rw5688883/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2020,paul-allaer,8," Julia Garner shines in stifling and devastating office working environment drama
","""The Assistant"" (2019 release; 85 min.) brings a day in the life of Jane. As the movie opens, Jane comes into the office at a pre-dawn hour, and get the office ready for another work week. She seems to be doing a little bit of everything (answering the office phone, collecting documents, cleaning up, etc.) Gradually people are filing in, and we understand pretty quickly that this is a film production house, with a stifling working environment and the shadows of the (always off-camera) head of the company lurking everywhere. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw5688883/?ref_=tt_urv

","The first 15minutes of the movie absolutely nothing happens. It's deader than the dead sea.
