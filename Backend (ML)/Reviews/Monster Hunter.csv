26 January 2022,Fella_shibby,7," I enjoyed it. Found it to be captivating inspite of it being predictable. It is beautifully shot with amazing LA vibe.
",This kinda detective thrillers used to be regular in the late 80s n early 90s.,/review/rw7694899/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2021,mrpicky,6," I actually enjoyed it
",Yes its simple and filled with clich√©'s but still very enjoyable. Could be better? Of course. Could be much worse? Hell yeah. So I'll take what i can here.,/review/rw7694899/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2021,Opinate,7," Enjoyable fun and characterful whodunnit.
","If you don't go in expecting too much there is lots to enjoy in this behind the scenes of a movie studio murder. It doesn't take itself too seriously and has lots of licks of a film noir, but a much lighter mood.",/review/rw7694899/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2021,supermellowcali,8," Worth the watch
","If you're going to watch something, this one's not a bad choice... a good story IMO- carried by a great cast and a crew who knew what they were doing- and it had enough distractions that I didn't know whodunnit until near the end Gibson was great but he's not the main character.",/review/rw7694899/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2022,deloudelouvain,7," Good Hollywood whodunnit movie.
","The last movies I watched with Mel Gibson were not great but in Last Looks he actually did a decent job for once. Charlie Hunnam, eye candy for the women apparently, was also enjoyable to watch. Throughout the whole movie the acting was good and that from the whole cast. The story is a bit mysterious, a bit Noir which is normally not really the genre I enjoy a lot, with a slight pinch of humor. It's not fast paced but the story is intriguing enough to keep your attention for the entire duration. Better than I thought it would be, good enough to watch once.",/review/rw7694899/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2021,loulou1992,8," Mel steal a good show
","Wow, while most of Hollywood is trying hard to destroy Mel Gibson he is proving strongly why he can't be taken down. Great performance by a great actor. He has seriously turned into SEAN Connery more he ages.... Well made film, kinda made me think of Fletch with many great moments... Don't let judgement cloud your mind here.",/review/rw7694899/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2021,frank-liesenborgs,7," Mel is back!
","And Charlie Hunnam has never been gone. Ex-LAPD cop Charlie Waldo (Charlie Hunnam) descends from his hill where he retired in order to investigate a high-profile murder. TV Actor Alastair Pinch (Mel Gibson) stands accused of murdering his wife, Monica. The plot and storyline are very smooth. This movie never gets boring. And we are witnessing the rebirth of Mel Gibson. Finally he delivers again. Charlie Hunnam never disappoints. What an acting performance. Where the story lacks originality, the acting never fails. The movie is fast paced and funny. A well-deserved 7/10 for never getting bored to death!",/review/rw7694899/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2021,bainz,7," pretty damn good
","I don't write many reviews so when I do the movie has to be really good (or really, really bad). This movies is funny, witty and keeps you guessing. Solid acting all around, not too long and had some quirky characters to keeps things interesting. Definitely one of the better movies I've seen this year. You could say this type of film has been made before and you're probably right - but it's unique and entertaining enough for me to easily recommend it.",/review/rw7694899/?ref_=tt_urv

12 May 2022,tchitouniaram,7," Very enjoyable ,

30 December 2021,chinmoy3264,10," Like many Old Classics
","This is in my opinion a ""by the book"" entertaining movie. Everything in this movie felt entertaining , never a snoozing moment. Story was intriguing enough, acting was good, could have been more of Morena Baccarin. Thats about it. Time and money worth spending .",/review/rw7694899/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2022,imseeg,4," Pretty silly, but not in a comical way, in a mediocre, this is going nowhere, way...
","The bad: completely silly and not credible role by Mel Gibson, who (for whatever reason) has got a terrible fake ""English"" accent.",/review/rw7694899/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2022,nogodnomasters,8," He is an Inuit not an Eskimo.
",Charlie Waldo (Charlie Hunnam) is a disgraced ex-cop living off the land in an isolated trailer. He limits his possessions to 100. He is requested by his ex-girlfriend (Morena Baccarin) to work with her on a high profile case as an investigator.

19 April 2022,paul_haakonsen,4," Slow paced and sort of pointless story...
","I stumbled upon the 2021 crime mystery ""Last Looks"" by random chance here in 2022, and seeing that them ovie had the likes of Morena Baccarin and Mel Gibson on the cast list, of course I opted to sit down and watch it. Since I hadn't heard about the movie, then I didn't know what to expect from director Tim Kirkby.",/review/rw7694899/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2021,dima-12,8," Is Mel passing the mantle to Charlie Hunnam in this film?
","Charlie Hunnam stars as Waldo, a maverick LAPD detective who quit the force and went from a star cop to a eco-obsessed recluse who decides to posses only one hundred objects at the time. His old flame, now a private investigator contacts him to help her with the case of famous British actor Alastair Pinch portrayed by Mel Gibson - now hamming it up in a network courtroom drama - accused of murder.",/review/rw7694899/?ref_=tt_urv

",Looks and feels like decently budgeted hollywood movie with a great cast. It's not.,/review/rw7694899/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2022,brandonmckay8,8," Enjoyable ride!
","Saw the trailer & thought it looked like some fun & it didn't disappoint. Fantastic cast & Charlie delivers as usual. The story is pretty good & flows nicely, No pointless stuff to put the run time up & it felt even quicker. Mel Gibson pretty perfect for this role too!",/review/rw7694899/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2022,ginocox-206-336968,8," An intriguing contemporary noir mystery only slightly marred by woeness
","Last Looks (2021) is an intriguing contemporary noir mystery, but is marred somewhat by clumsy efforts to insert incongruous woke elements. Performances by the male characters are stellar, particularly by Mel Gibson (Alastair Pinch), Rupert Friend (Wilson Sikorsky), and Charlie Hunnam (Charlie Waldo); however, the female characters seem substantially less developed. Production values are good, although there are no memorable scenes of fight choreography, car chases, pyrotechnics, or firefights.",/review/rw7694899/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," Where's Waldo? Nobody cares.
","This film was an all around bore and such a waste of talent. The 110 min runtime felt like over 3 hours, with slow pacing, and long dragged out and unnecessary scenes. I've never read the novel, but what I saw here was the lamest whodunnit film I've seen in a long time. The genres labeled where Action, Crime and Mystery, and I struggled to find any one of them. There were characters that were irrelevant and pretty much filler and a waste of film. The story was nonsense, and the sluthing was infantile and illogical. The screenplay was riddled with plot and technical issues, and scenes felt unfinished and/or unnecessary. The writing and some of the dialogue felt lazy and sloppy. It's something I'd expect to see on Lifetime in one of those murder-mystery TV shows with no name actors. Mel Gibson shined and pulled off that drunken snob Brit accent with ease, and Hunnam was ok. I wanted to see more of Morena Baccarin in that smoke-show outfit. Most of the cast did their best to save this mess, but even with the cool soundtrack, this was a huge miss. It's a generous 6/10 from me, mostly because Gibson was the only entertainment in the entire film.",/review/rw7694899/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2022,joiningjt,8," I liked it more than I thought I would ESPECIALLY Mel and Charlie
","It started slow and isnt your action packed film I was expecting so that threw me off but once I realized it was a mystery comedy we enjoyed it
The cast was excellent and Mel Gibson was hilarious and as usual in top form its a shame people JUDGE him based on a few drunk episodes sorry but I've had MANY a drunk episode in my day I'm just lucky that I'm not in the PUBLIC eye so i dont get judged and dont have to be PERFECT. Anyway it also features the UNDERRATED Charlie Hunnam who is fantastic in this film . I highly recommend it if you like a funny who done it here you go.",/review/rw7694899/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2021,peterlsmith-564-962159,8," Why not a TV series
",This movie should adapt itself extremely well to an ongoing TV series. The characters and their eccentricities and dynamics would transpose well to TV.,/review/rw7694899/?ref_=tt_urv
