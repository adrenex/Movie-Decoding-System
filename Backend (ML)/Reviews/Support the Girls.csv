8 January 2021,drjgardner,9," Wonderful
","This series has wonderful acting, great locations, and a deliciously complicated script that may put off some people. What may be best about the series is that you can never tell when a major character is going to be bumped off, or who did it. That's so unusual on TV (or in films) that a writer and cast brave enough to do this has to be saluted.
It's also great that they were able to come up with two very different scripts for the two seasons. They both involve the reporter as the central character and there are a few hold-overs, but the scripts are very different making the show even more entertaining.
I can only hope they have a third season. This type of quality TV is very rare.",/review/rw4713734/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2017,robert-temple-1,9," Political intrigue, mystery, conspiracy, and espionage in Australia
","This is a very exciting Ossie conspiracy series set in the Australian capital of Canberra. There are two outstanding performances in the series which hold it all together and make the series work. Jacki Weaver is spellbinding as the evil, Machiavellian Attorney General named Catriona Bailey. And the lead role is played by Anna Torv, who has an effortless ability to compel one's attention, and who held together the American series FRINGE (2008, see my review), all 87 episodes of which I watched with bated breath. So she easily handles the mere six episodes of this one. She is such a stalwart lead for a series, that if she is cast, you can know it will work. The plot is exceedingly complex and ingenious. Everyone is betraying everyone, and it is impossible to know who all the good guys are and who the bad guys are, except of course for Anna Torv, who plays a crusading political journalist who is always trying to expose corruption. (And in Australia there is certainly plenty of that, as the Ossies are always complaining about it.) Here the corruption is more to do with insidious political scheming than with financial matters. Weaver wants to establish a police state in Australia with herself in control. For this purpose, she has drawn up an Act to create the Safer Australia Agency, of which she will be the head. She stages false flag operations, has opponents murdered, and manipulates international events to create a climate of fear, so that the Ossies will surrender their civil rights in order to 'be kept safe'. She succeeds in doing this. Draconian laws then come into being which permit people like Anna Torv to be detained indefinitely and imprisoned for the 'offence' of informing the public of the truth about the conspiracies by the Australian Deep State. Sound familiar? Secret courts are established and no one can publicly reveal that he or she has been detained without spending ten years in prison for revealing it. The background to all of this is a simulated threat from China. Weaver is scheming with the Americans to have a military conflict with the Chinese at sea, and stages a false 13 minute 'cyber attack' on Australian air space, leaving everything in the air helpless, both military and civil, then insists it was a Chinese attack on her country. She had secretly given orders through a corrupted general to have various backup units stand down the day before, therefore rendering the nation helpless. Having sufficiently terrified Australia, she gets her bill passed and becomes the shadow dictator of a country whereby the Prime Minister is always the last to know anything critical, while she holds all the cards. Numerous people get killed along with the way, including Torv's ex-husband who has become a woman working for the spy agency. She is played very effectively by Damon Herriman. There is so much intrigue in this gripping series that one hopes that 'Season One' on the front of the DVD means there really will be a Season Two, though so far none is scheduled for production.",/review/rw4713734/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2016,radursm,10," One of the best
","If you expect political intrigue as in ""House of Cards"", treason, espionage, as in ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"", dark hints on the geopolitical evolution of the world (USA, China, and the rest of the world), then this is the show to watch. Ah, and a it has the realism that is somewhat lacking (lately) in ""Homeland"". Also, it has some intellectual references, as well, which is rarely seen in the nowadays cinema (be it TV, even!). A good cast. Anna Torv is convincing, and her complex character reminds me of Claire Dane's ""Carrie Mathison"". Even smaller roles are played wonderfully by each of the actors.",/review/rw4713734/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2018,samanthacato,9," Fantastic Hidden Gem
","I know other reviewers have slated the pace and some of the quirky sub-plots but I really enjoyed this. If not for Netflix, I would never have heard of it. I'm a Brit but there were so many recognisable Australian faces. Great actors. You don't have to overthink it. Yes, it is another Government conspiracy plot but just go with the flow. If it's not your bag, it doesn't mean that it was badly made. Just take it off and watch something else. Some of us actually liked it. I hope Season 2 will be just as good, if not, better.",/review/rw4713734/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2020,jsrtheta,10," Full Marks
","I normally am not a big fan of the ""Deep State Conspiracy"" genre. Usually they are cartoonish, unlikely, and too clever by half. But I've seen two of these now, both Australian, ""The Code"" and this remarkable achievement, ""Secret City"".",/review/rw4713734/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2019,azanti0029,8," A good solid political thriller which feels very relevant today
","Secret City is the kind of drama that the has the feel of the old school House of Cards but with a modern veneer. Set predominantly in the capital of Canberra, among rising tensions between the Australian and Chinese Governments a determined and stubborn reporter, Harriet Dunkley searches for the truth when a friend is murdered. In the process she stumbles on a complex plot involving the highest level of her own Government and with multiple factions involved.",/review/rw4713734/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2016,jitarth,10," Why haven't you watched this already?
","I'll be honest, I went into this not expecting much. No scratch that, I was expecting to be disappointed, another thinly veiled attempt at recreating a style of show best left to others. I was wrong, oh so wrong. Secret City is a nuanced, understated and never clich√©d blend of political intrigue and personal demons with a satisfyingly Australian flavour. It eschews the over the top melodramatic candy that would've been so easy to stuff down the throats of viewers in an attempt to keep them satiated in favour of a slower, more tantalising meal built layer upon layer leaving the viewer oh so much more satisfied by the end.

9 July 2018,mjpersson-05208,9," Excellent Characters and Story
","I'm an American who resides in Arizona, but have found such a connection to the excellent acting and portrayals that Australian and British programming provides. This program is no exception. The characters are indeed excellent and the actors are so believable against the backdrop of a properly paced thriller, that is not engulfed in over the top special effects.",/review/rw4713734/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2016,shastings-99261,10," Brilliant!
","This is the best Australian TV show I have ever watched. The lies and Corruption by those who govern us. One could see this being based on a true story, or at least a story that is no doubt commonplace throughout the world we live in. Magnificently written, well acted by a great cast. Very important to watch carefully to follow and understand the plot, with twists and turns at every unexpected corner. The people aren't the people you think they are, well, most of them and is that not the place in the real world of politics. It reminds me of America or at least what goes on over there from what I have read. Whilst some may consider it a bit slow I would say to them ""all good things take time"". My hope is that the show continues for many years. The person, who wrote this has more of an understanding of the real world than most so I expect more and more twists and turns to come in the second series. This is a show I could watch everyday.",/review/rw4713734/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2019,supermario1,10," Slow burner, but solid. Season 2 (Under The Eagle) is better than Season 1
","Show seems a little slow, but it's because there's not action, yelling, and fighting in every scene. Background music/score is low and quiet, Most of the time absent which may cause some to think it boring--it's not. Allow yourself to get into it. Pay attention--its not a show you can follow when doing something else like looking at your phone. Season 2 is a bit better in my opinion, more gripping and a little easier to follow.",/review/rw4713734/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2018,andymhancock,9," Mostly good
","Season 1: Stark, no-BS atmosphere. Great acting. And, of course, Anna Torv. The plot kept me wondering. However, the plausibility of the plot also kept me wondering. Lots of cultural stereotypes, perhaps out of keeping with the times. Suspension of belief is needed as to how politicians would react to cyber terrorism, the kind of attributions that would be made without informed discussion, and policy fall-out without challenge (though one fears that this is indeed possible in reality). There is also the one character that seems to be at the centre of everything, by virtue of who knows what. That final ingredient seems to be a common archilles heel for plots of intrigue. Somehow, beyond any plausibility, one character seems to be all things to all people and situations. Sure, it makes for a plot that is difficult to figure out, but it would be better if they found a way to do this with greater plausibility.
Season 2: Same refreshing stark no-BS atmosphere & acting. Same wondering about the plausibility of the plot. There would have to be gob smacking failures of information security measures for what happened to actually happen in real life. As in season 1, one fears that this is indeed plausible in reality.",/review/rw4713734/?ref_=tt_urv

23 May 2021,sfdphd,8," excellent political suspense thriller
","I really enjoyed the first season. Haven't seen the second season, but very satisfied by the first six episodes which I practically binge watched. Interesting focus on Australia and China vs. The USA. Very intense, with compelling story and characters. Recommended if you like international politics and drama. If you like this series, you'd probably also like Black Earth Rising, with Michaela Coel and John Goodman, about England, France, and the hidden truths about the Rwandan genocide.",/review/rw4713734/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2018,TwoCrude,7," Decent series
","I enjoyed this show's first season, for the most part. Anna Torv's performance was well delivered. Political machinations in Canberra are an interesting aspect of the show. The writers dropped the ball on a few occasions (one or two of them were fairly ridiculous), but the show was better than many of its type. I am looking forward to season 2.",/review/rw4713734/?ref_=tt_urv

",I'd never heard of this film and know no one else who has seen it by me in the UK but stumbled across it and ended up watching the entire first season in a day completely hooked and again with the 2nd season more recently. Great political and spy drama with plenty of twists constantly having you on the edge of your seat. Criminally underrated a must watch in my eyes.,/review/rw4713734/?ref_=tt_urv

8 April 2019,efd-10467,7," Good but at times a stretch
","The series takes a bit from House of Cards and a bit from John Le Carre and overall is interesting. At times though the plot jumps to keep the story moving along, the main character Harriet keeps having these moments of clarity or understanding a little too often, also at times too many bad guys, if everyone was this corrupt and secretive the country would cease operating at a very basic level. You start to assume everyone is a liar apart from Harriet and they are, it is a bit predictable, but fun.",/review/rw4713734/?ref_=tt_urv
