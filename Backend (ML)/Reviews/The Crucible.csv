23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Johnny Depp's greatest movie!!
","""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is one of the best musical films ever made and probably the last truly excellent Tim Burton effort in directing. It's a romantic and enthralling vision of the dark perspective about life and death for the poor people controled by the privileged, cruel and envious society. It finds a inspired Johnny Depp in probably his best performance of this century. Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall compelte this luxury cast, which is one of the most talented one assembled in a musical!",/review/rw1851673/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2008,marcosaguado,10," Sublime
","As it happens more often than not, greatness is relegated to some obscure angle. In a year of brilliant opuses by the Cohen Brothers and PT Anderson, this Tim Burton film shines as the best from every angle. It's not just that Burton creates another superb, dark universe with Dante Ferretti's complicity or that Johnnt Deep breaks new ground, or that Helena Bonham Carter surprises us with a complex, marvelous realistic parody. The film touches visually a very private cord. Ed Wood managed that but Tim Burton with ""Sweeny Todd"" elevates it to the purest form of art. He will be punished for that, as Ed Wood was in its day. Disappointing grosses in a world that worship grosses will make it appear as a sort of a failure. My advise to you is run to see it wherever you can find it. Try to see it in a big screen with great sound. You will fly and dream and be taken away by the masterful hands of Tim Burton and the glorious faces of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter.",/review/rw1851673/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2007,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," The best musical in years!
","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is one of the year's most talked about films, it's getting big Oscar buzz and of course, what could be better than Tim Burton taking on this dark musical? With Johnny Depp starring along with beautiful Helena Bonham Carter by his side, this movie just screams terrific. My mom and I saw the movie today and Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street lived beyond to my expectations. Tim Burton hasn't exactly released a classic lately that would be remembered for all time, but Sweeny Todd is sure to make it's way into one of the most memorable films of 2007. Johnny Depp and Helena both have incredible voices, they were so hauntingly beautiful and magical together, it's like these roles were made for them. Along with an equally strong cast as Alan Rickman and Sacha Baron Cohen who were also incredible, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a new memorable musical for years to come.",/review/rw1851673/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2007,planktonrules,9," Brilliantly executed but highly disturbing
","Sweeney Todd is an old story that is not based on a real 19th century murderer--despite some recent rumors that this legend is true. Though the original story has changed a bit over the years, the basic elements remain. A man is wrongly convicted and returns years later to exact revenge--slicing the throats of the wicked (and sometimes innocent) and then having the bodies disposed of in meat pies sold to the unsuspecting public!

2 March 2008,katiemeyer1979,10," Johnny and Tim forever
","What an extraordinary treat this bloody dirty tale of vengeance and gore is. The exquisite way Tim Burton presents it to us makes it so. Stephen Sondheim's stage masterpiece becomes a film masterpiece of unequaled stature. Everything about it reeks of genius of magic. Once again, Johnny Depp fills, Burton's macabre universe with overwhelming humanity. He can slash as many throats as he wants if we look into Johnny's eyes we see the struggle, the human winning in despair. I know I'm not making too much sense but I just want to urge you, if you love cinema, to rush and see it as God intended, on a big screen and Dolby surround sound.",/review/rw1851673/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2007,Boris_Day,9," Tim Burton's most dramatically satisfying film so far.
","I approached Sweeney Todd with trepidation, having been underwhelmed with most of Tim Burton's recent output and every screen musical of the last decade. The biggest problem I have with Burton's films is that his screenplays rarely manage to pull their disparate elements into a satisfying whole. Here, despite adapting the material to his own sensibilities and shortening the play by an hour, he adheres closely to Sondheim's book, resulting in the most dramatically satisfying film Burton has ever made.

1 March 2008,malleyvoice,10," Gloriously Dark
","Tim Burton has gone beyond himself and anything he has ever done. ""Sweeney Todd"" is stunningly beautiful. Dark? yes, bloody? sure! but then we're in Victorian London where everything is what it appears to be no matter how turgid. The meeting of Mr Todd and Mrs Lovett is so scrumptiously conceived that I'm sure will be one of those film moments that are used whenever ""great film moments"" are compiled. Johnny Depp will never cease to amaze me. He is not just the beautiful boy with soulful eyes, but a great actor. How extraordinary that two talents like Burton and Depp should meet at the perfect moment in time. How lucky for us! Mrs Lovett is played by another extraordinary actor: Helena Bonham Carter. She is spectacular! Sacha Baron Cohen, Alan Rickman and in particular Timothy Spall add to the perfection of this film. Dante Ferreti, the production designer and Coleen Attwood, the costume designer, deserve all the kudos they are getting and will get. Glorious!",/review/rw1851673/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2007,ShellyA227,9," Dark Humor Done Right
","Despite the grim expectations from the story synopsis, the film delivers gore in a surprisingly tasteful way. There are no screaming teenagers running from a lunatic; instead we get a somewhat British blend of satire, slapstick and just ""wrong"" humor. Although I'm not much of a Johnny Depp fan, I enjoyed his performance as well as Helena Bonham Carter's. Even the portrayal of the common clients was stunning.",/review/rw1851673/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2007,roquedog504,10," A refreshing and brilliant film
","Contrary to the many comments I have read and heard about the film thus far, I thought it was absolutely wonderful. After what some could term a ""dry spell"" for Tim Burton, it is such a breath of fresh air to see this new offering, Sweeney Todd. The movie showed Tim returning to his roots of the dark, the sinister, and the macabre. All were blended together in the setting he is so very well-known for, the dark streets of London.",/review/rw1851673/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2007,ArrestedDevelopee,8," Tim Burton Claims Sweeney As His Own!
","As a fan of the original stage version of this grimly Gothic tale, going into Sweeney Todd was bittersweet in my hopes and expectations. However, I'm pleased to announce that I did find Burton's latest effort impressive and intentional. Fans of the original won't be disappointed with a top-notch cast and the wonderfully dark overtures that haunt every minute of Sweeney Todd. Tim Burton, one of the masters of ambiance, sets his atmosphere in the grisly streets of a depressed London and his artistry punctures through every scene of screen time. I would have to clarify that, while Johnny Depp is a skilled actor, fans of the original will find it hard to believe that Depp has the ability to transform into the George Hearn ""Sweeny"" we've come to know. This is in fact true and recognized by Burton. In this respect, the character of Depp is not played as the same manner as the deep-voiced, towering Todd from the musical adaptation. Depp's is more of a less boisterous and thoughtful one. The vocal performances are great but have a different approach and feel to them. It was a refreshing adaptation and I feel a triumph on the part of Burton for making a stage-to-screen experience that captures you from it's bloody introduction.",/review/rw1851673/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2007,AnneOBrienRice,10," A Conventicle of Geniuses Came Together Here
","And this conventicle has brought us a glistening and irresistible nightmare. There are delicious Dickensian overtones throughout, and the look of the film itself is poetically potent. The entire mix is shockingly seductive with an unforgettable ending. Burton's humor is part and parcel of his sheer brilliance, as always, and, as always, the great Johnny Depp is intense and positively unforgettable. All performances are electric, the pace and length are perfect, and the film draws us deeper and deeper with every moment into its stunning blend of the grotesque and the undeniably beautiful. Analysing the power of a film like this is no simple matter. The whole is dazzlingly disturbing. You don't want to miss a second of it, even though the film is merciless to us and to its protagonists. It sings, it glows, it enchants, it horrifies. I want to see it again. And again. It's a brutal and shattering masterpiece.",/review/rw1851673/?ref_=tt_urv

7 December 2007,motta80-2,9," Got me onside, surprisingly good
","I am generally not a fan of musicals. I don't like the artifice of singing dialogue moments. I have no problem with singing in a movie but this grates on me. Take Dreamgirls for instance. For the most part i was fine with it, good songs, performed as performances with a narrative structure surrounding them. However once of twice it had songs in place of dialogue where characters were discussing things amongst themselves or some such thing and i just got annoyed. And yes i dislike all the classics like West Side Story for this very reason.",/review/rw1851673/?ref_=tt_urv

","In the Victorian London, the barber Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) is married with the gorgeous Lucy and they have a lovely child, Johanna. The beauty of Lucy attracts the attention of the corrupt Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) that falsely accuses the barber of a crime that he had not committed and abuses of Lucy later. After fifteen years in exile, Benjamin returns to London under the new identity of Sweeney Todd, seeking revenge against Turpin. Sweeney Todd meets the widow Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) and owner of a meat pie shop that tells him that Lucy committed suicide with arsenic many years ago, and Turpin assigned himself as tutor of Johanna. He opens a barber shop above her store, initiating a crime rampage against those that made him suffer and lose his beloved family.",/review/rw1851673/?ref_=tt_urv

30 January 2009,blanche-2,7," Attend the tale
","""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,"" directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, is based on the Stephen Sondheim musical from the 1970s. I remember sitting stage right, down front, in the theater when I saw this musical with Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou and being completely, utterly blown away. As a stage show, it was jaw-dropping, with some of Sondheim's most beautiful music: ""Johanna"" is perhaps my favorite of all Sondheim's songs, but the score also includes the beautiful ""Not While I'm Around"" and ""Pretty Women.""

21 December 2007,Bob-240,10," Bloody good!
","This movie stunned me so much that I could hardly move from my seat when it was over. The dark cinematography is brilliant and works so well to enhance the story. Johnny Depp has given us so many amazing performances in the past and you can put this one up there at the top of the list. I have to admit that in the past I have loathed Tim Burton offerings but he redeems himself in my opinion with a feast for the eyes and ears that is a triumph. I approached the movie with trepidation because actors put in singing roles seldom work, but not this time. The singing was not only terrific, it was mesmerizing. I have to warn you this movie is for movie fans that love music (Broadway, classical or opera) and have a cast iron stomach. I heard they used 70 gallons of fake blood filming it and I believe them. All I can say is you can see the bloody scenes coming a mile off so you have plenty of time to avert your eyes.",/review/rw1851673/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2007,Quinoa1984,10," about the juiciest, bloodiest good/sad musical time you'll have this year
","With Sweeney Todd, one of the most notorious (and acclaimed) stories to come out of 19th century London England, and later as a much more acclaimed musical from Stephen Soundheim, Tim Burton crafts a masterpiece of the macabre, a work full of harsh, visceral drama, a sinister look to the picture which only once or twice takes an escape to brighter (more elusive) pastures, and even pitch-black humor, the kind that isn't fit for the gallows but a slice of a razor to a horrible demise at the meat-grinder. It's also a sad film, a deep sorrow that pulses in nearly every frame that Johnny Depp occupies as Benjamin Barker-turned-Sweeney Todd which pervades the wretched vengeance that he seeks following his inexcusable detachment from his wife and daughter via Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). Burton here, more than ever I might wager, deals with punishment and evil, as well as what it means to be an anti-hero (if one could call a ""Demon Barber"" as such), and as well what a real cold-blooded villain is.",/review/rw1851673/?ref_=tt_urv

24 January 2008,Cinemadharma,3," Burton slits Sondheim's throat.
","Stephen Sondheim's musical ""Sweeney Todd"" explores moral dualism -- the belief of the coexistence or conflict between the ""benevolent"" and the ""malignant"", such as a conflict between good and evil. Sondheim expresses this in many ways, chief among them is his extensive use of counterpoint. Counterpoint is ""the relationship between two or more voices that are independent in contour and rhythm, and interdependent in harmony"". The term comes from the Latin 'punctus contra punctum' or ""note against note"". Counterpoint is often used in musicals, especially in songs that try to compare or contrast two or more characters' views. As written and originally conceived and staged, the musical counterpoint in ""Sweeney Todd"" mirrors not only the difference of views between the characters, but the conflict of views within each character.",/review/rw1851673/?ref_=tt_urv

4 April 2008,ccthemovieman-1,8," Is This Music & Mayhem Pic As Bizarre As They Say? Yup!
","If you haven't seen this film and are expecting something bizarre from the collaboration director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp.....well, you're going to get it! This is different......mainly because most of the dialog is sung, like an opera. However, at least half of that is half spoken-half sung so it isn't really operatic. Burton displays his usual dark visions and wonderful cinematography and Depp plays his normal strange, dark character. I can't say that all the singing appealed to me, but the actors did a credible job with it. In fact, Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and company surprised me how well they all sang considering they aren't known for that talent.",/review/rw1851673/?ref_=tt_urv
