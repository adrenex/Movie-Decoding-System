24 October 2013,gogoschka-1,," Great set-design and action - terrible dialogue
","Just watched it again yesterday - it's striking how good the action is compared to the ridiculous dialogue. I completely understand why this movie got such terrible reviews; after all, it marked the first ""let's make a quick buck"" entry in the two beloved Alien and Predator franchises and was done by a director who many felt didn't treat the material with the respect it deserved. When I watched it yesterday I got angry at times because some of the dialogue - well, most of it, actually - is truly awful. It's hard to take characters or a story seriously when nearly every sentence spoken resembles lines from a parody of cheap science-fiction and horror movies from the fifties and sixties. But despite all those flaws I have to admit I enjoyed the movie from start to finish - because of the amazing set- and creature-design and the more than decent action sequences and special effects. Whoever designed those really scored and seems to have a great love for the art of Giger and the previous films. So if you can get past the silly characters and you're able to ignore the more obvious shortcomings (like the idiotic decision to make the film PG-13) you're in for a fun ride. My vote: 6.5 out of 10.",/review/rw1016819/?ref_=tt_urv

",Alien vs. Predator (2004) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a research expedition that recently was discovered miles under the ice. The research team doesn't know the pyramid was setup as a hunting playground for Predators to test their hunting skills against the ultimate beings...and we aren't talking about humans.,/review/rw1016819/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2016,zumo-16908,7," Pretty good for what it is
","Some say that AVP is silly and that the plot is thin, and they are right, but this movie is not about realism or story depth. Its an action movie where people are hunted by terrifying monsters and get killed without discrimination. This is a slight depart from the original Alien movie and Predator movie which had a more serious tone, so i understand why some may be disappointed by AVP. But if you expect a solid no-brainer action movie that entertains the viewers with suspense and action without taking itself too serious, then you get exactly that. It is a joy to watch all the right people get killed and the right people survive their encounter with the aliens and the predator. The main character is actually quite likable. Its not like in Prometheus, where you'd grow increasingly apathetic with each silly decision made by the characters.",/review/rw1016819/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2018,TheMovieDoctorful,9," The Most Underrated Alien Film (And My Personal Favorite)
","The original Alien vs. Predator film is my favorite Alien movie. Note that I didn't say it was the best Alien movie (Even I wouldn't dare call this a better film than Alien or Aliens), but it is easily, without a doubt, my personal favorite entry in the franchise. It's easily its most underrated entry, far exceeding the expectations of a PG-13 crossover film with much more to offer than the intriguing premise of a fight between 80s monster icons. AvP: Alien vs. Predator is a film made with surprising levels of care in its characterizations, acting performances, themes and visual direction and it's a far better film than it has any right to be.",/review/rw1016819/?ref_=tt_urv

24 July 2014,bowmanblue,6," Ahh, it could have been so good
","The 'Aliens versus Predator' storyline has been with us ever since the 'Predator 2' when Danny Glover huffed and puffed his way across what looked like an alien's skull in the Predator's trophy cabinet. This brief image sparked a storm among fans, whose dreams and wishes were subsequently realised by volumes of comics and graphic novels regarding the subject matter. And they were actually pretty good! Having read a fair few of them, it seemed no end to the possibilities of pitting two of the big screen's most famous monsters against each other. With so many ideas as to what could be done, how could they possibly lose?",/review/rw1016819/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2022,owenpont-70803,6," Has its moments........
","I am a big Alien and Predator fan. So I was excited to watch this, but wow this was disappointing. First off, why would you make an Alien Vs Predator movie PG-13? Secondly there were way to many plots. And the character development was very poor. Even then, I wish they wouldn't make the human characters a main part of the film. You spend to much time with them before you even see the Alien or Predator start attacking anyone. I will say though, the film was not boring. There is lots of shut your brain off entertainment in this film. I thought the lore of it was neat. And the Alien and Predator action was fun. Overall its a film that is entertaining but has very clear faults and for a film like this, it shouldn't have to many faults.",/review/rw1016819/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2021,derek-a-charette100,8," Such an underrated movie
","I don't understand the low rating. I see a review complaining about dialogue... considering the second half of the movie has nearly zero dialogue in it, I wonder if this person actually watched the whole movie, or maybe watched a different movie altogether...
HOW MUCH ECCENTRIC AND INTELLECTUAL DIALOGUE SHOULD AN ACTION MOVIE HAVE? Looking back at the classic action movies, AVP is right on par with the dialogue of the others, and actually above average.",/review/rw1016819/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2013,A_Different_Drummer,9," shows how reviewers like to fool themselves
","I love IMDb and think it provides an invaluable service, a time capsule if you will, of popular opinion. Every now and then however the review page has less to do with the quality of the film and oh so much more to do with human nature. And specifically the way we like to kid ourselves. AVP is a great example. Superficially, this film should not have worked. Superficially this yet another in a long line of cheap exploitative ""high concept"" sequels - Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman, Jason meets Freddy, etc. But here is the kicker. This film was superbly done. From the opening sequence in Antarctic where something is discovered under the ice (how creepy is THAT?) to the scene where the giant ""breeder"" alien gets loose, to the clever mini-climax where heroine Sanaa Lathan gets props from her new Predator buddy -- these are the hallmarks of an entertaining film, and an effective film. But before we break out the champagne, let's pay attention to the elephant in the room -- the overall IMDb rating may be on par with a Bugs Bunny cartoon (and a bad one, at that) but there at last count something like 1500 IMDb members who have taken the time to punch the keys and weigh in with personal reviews. Not to belabour the obvious, but when you have 1500 people looking to opine on a film, whatever you may think of that film, it is anything but mediocre. Think about it...",/review/rw1016819/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2015,kclipper,7," Combining two classic movie monsters into one dynamic showdown!
","25 years ago Ridley Scott scared us with his terror in space original ""Alien"" in which technically adept director, James Cameron elaborated on successfully in ""Aliens"". Then came the concept of an advanced race of aliens that hunt for sport using state-of-the-art technology in the box office smash, ""Predator"". The 1991 sequel, ""Predator 2"" featured an in-joke at the film's climax where Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" skull is observed as being a trophy inside the ""Predator's"" spaceship, and that idea launched the 1993 Super Nintendo video game, the Stephen Perry book and not to mention various graphic novels that pitted the two species against each-other in a mega-war between the races.",/review/rw1016819/?ref_=tt_urv

13 August 2004,MovieAddict2016,4," With its shameful rating, poor acting, awful writing and mediocre direction, 'AvP' disappoints the fans at every turn, and will probably leave non-fans feeling a little wishy-washy. Fox has taken two of thei
","We don't go to see movies about dueling alien species for deep themes and intricate character development, but a little sympathy would be nice. I didn't feel any sympathy for the characters in 'Alien vs. Predator' because they were all unlikable clich√©s: The Heroine, The Hero, The Nerd, The Tomboy, The Gruff Leader, et al. These carbon cut out characters we've seen in hundreds of other films are all assembled together by Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) in 'AvP' to venture into the Antarctic, where they uncover an ancient pyramid recently discovered by Weyland's multi-million dollar satellites hovering about in space.",/review/rw1016819/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2004,jaywolfenstien,," Paradoxial
","Most people going into this film want to see one thing: Aliens and Predators rip into each other. I suspect a great many geeks and lame individuals inhabiting message boards of every corner of the internet will complain that this film spends too much time with the humans when the name of the film is 'Alien versus Predator' and they couldn't care about the humans, and another sect will whine about how shallow the film is to jump right to the big fight as soon as it can possibly set it up.

16 February 2020,Muhammad_Rafeeq,10," Really underated, one of my all time favorites. A mixture of two classic alien franchises in an action packed film. Highly recommend. ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10
","As a film is not something excelent. BUT, at those days back it was a dream to see on screen the battle between those two iconic vilains. And that film gave us the pleasure. Still, Henriksen is one of the most underated actors.",/review/rw1016819/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2004,dee.reid,7," It took 14 years...
","...Before a possible showdown between the iconic monsters of ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" would occur, when they would cross paths on screen and battle to the death. There's a scene in ""Predator 2"" that occurs towards the end of the film, where Lt. Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) ventures into the Predator spaceship and accidentally stumbles onto the alien hunter's trophy room, and neatly placed towards the back amongst the various awards, was an alien skull. Those 10 seconds of film spawned over a decade's worth of rumors that one day these titans were going to go at it head-to-head, and that whoever won, we'd lose.",/review/rw1016819/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2019,foxtografo,8," Great crossover
","This is a great movie, I thought everything looks great, the story is quite solid for the excuse needed to see both monsters on the same movie, the characters were acceptable and the stages look amazing.
Then, some fight between the Aliens and Predators felt a bit clumsy, the choreographs were not always the best, but it was good action overall.
The characters (humans) again, maybe the weakest point, could have been more interesting, but no one annoyed me to the point of dislike or ruining the movie.
Cinematography was very good, as it was the designs (stages over all), and the flashback scene was absolutely amazing!!
I really don't understand why so low in rating, honesty, I sense some fanboy hate here, the movie is great fun to watch and is way better than other Aliens and Predator movies.",/review/rw1016819/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2021,hnt_dnl,9," Underrated
","While I think that the first Alien and Predator movies of the respective franchises are classics and deserve their lofty status, as far as the individual franchises go, I've never been a fan of any of the sequels, the exception being Alien:Covenant, a pretty good movie, in my opinion. But it's really this movie ALIEN VS PREDATOR (2004) which connects the 2 franchises that's always been a guilty pleasure of mine and over time I've come to like it as a genuinely good film. As far as favorites go, AVP is probably my 2nd favorite film to watch in the universe only behind the original Predator.",/review/rw1016819/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2020,elliotjeory,5," I came for the aliens
",Yes the film is a disappointment and the characters are terrible but to be honest I just like it for the predator and alien scenes. It's always fun to watch these aliens on the screen doing their thing. Check your brain at the door and watch some intergalactic gladiator battles.,/review/rw1016819/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2004,mentalcritic,2," Alien and Predator for Barney's primary audience...
","If you give a toss about the story, stop reading. But believe me, this comment couldn't possibly ruin the film for you any more than Fox has. Spare a thought for Paul Anderson as he struggles to make a film that hasn't been neutered by the MPAA or a cowardly studio. Once Paul Verhoeven left America to resume his stellar work in Europe, I guess the MPAA had to have someone to pound upon. After moronic parents who took their single-digit-age children to see Resident Evil complained, I guess it was inevitable that future Anderson projects face an even bigger butcher's knife.",/review/rw1016819/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2020,DanteRiggs,10," I love this movie
","I think I watched this movie at least 4 times.
I loved it as a kid and I love it now, as an adult. I don't get the hate, especially from the Alien/Predator fans. AVP is a fun action movie and a much anticipated crossover. If you liked Aliens and/or the Predator movies, how can you not like this?!

8 February 2005,BrandtSponseller,10," Forget the naysayers, this film kicks butt!
","Series note: It is strongly recommended that viewers watch the Aliens and Predator films prior to watching this film. In order, the Predator films are Predator (1987) and Predator 2 (1990). The Alien films are Alien (1979), Aliens (1986), Alien 3 (1992) and Alien Resurrection (1997). While Alien vs. Predator isn't constructed as a chapter in a continuing story, watching the other films first will give you a more thorough grounding in the mythology behind the two series, bringing greater depth to this film.",/review/rw1016819/?ref_=tt_urv
