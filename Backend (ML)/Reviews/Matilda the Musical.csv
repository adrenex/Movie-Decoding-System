","Let's hope not, for a long time. While it's not a perfect movie, the 3 leads are so charismatic, they carry anything the movie throws at them. Some things may bit coincidental and may feel too convenient, but again you won't be thinking about that while watching the movie. You know a couple of things just by watching the movie and you can almost guess the ""twists"" entirely.",/review/rw3679644/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2017,themovieparadise,8," You Get What You Expect
","The best part about this movie is seeing Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Alan Arkin all on screen together. They have fantastic chemistry, and you really feel like their characters have actually been friends for 30+ years. They just glow on screen, and seeing them riff on each other and have a good time made for me to have a good time as well. They all gave great performances. The supporting cast was also really good. It was fun to see Christopher Lloyd pop up in a film again. We also got see some good performances from Kenan Thompson and Ann-Margret. Look, with this movie, there are no revolutionary jokes. It's everything you would expect there to be. I do tend to prefer edgier comedy than this, but I made my peace with it the second the first joke hit. This isn't meant to be a Seth Rogen kind of comedy. This is supposed to just be a fun, light- hearted, feel-good comedy, and it was really good for what it was...",/review/rw3679644/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2017,bankofmarquis,7," Like Eating Comfort Food
","The new film, GOING IN STYLE, is the equivalent of eating a Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Tomato Soup on a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon - very familiar, very welcome and very comforting.  It's not going to win any Academy Awards or change the course of movie history, but this film delivers - competently and professionally - what it promises to deliver with no fuss and no muss.",/review/rw3679644/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2017,zardoz-13,8," Old Guys Rule!!!
","Remakes shouldn't carbon copy the originals. ""Garden State"" director Zach Braff of ""Scrubs"" and ""Hidden Figures"" scenarist Theodore Melfi have jettisoned more from the original ""Going in Style"" than you might expect, but they also have lightened up the tone with amusing shenanigans and gags galore. Initially, ""Going in Style"" (1979) blended low-key comedy with grim drama in its straightforward depiction of brazen oldsters who engineered a bank heist wearing little more than dime-store disguises, essentially Groucho Marx masks, with big black glasses, big bulging noses, and big droopy mustaches. George Burns, Art Carney, and Les Strasberg starred as the ambitious old geezers who held up a bank because they were bored with their daily routine of sitting on a park bench. Sadly, those three old-timers didn't live happily ever after once they got away with the goods. Two of them croaked after the crime, and the mastermind surrendered and served time. Ultimately, the mastermind refused to divulge the location of the loot. In the end, he decided that he could break out of the prison with little difficulty. Imagine George Burns imitating the perennially pugnacious Humphrey Bogart, and you'll have a good idea what a hard-boiled egg Burns made as the ringleader of the elderly triumvirate. If you've never heard of George Burns, he was the cigar-smoking comedian who made the ""Oh, God!"" trilogy. ",/review/rw3679644/?ref_=tt_urv

18 December 2017,lee_eisenberg,8," bank on it
","A number of movies in the past decade have looked at the role that the banks played in crashing the economy, but few have looked at how these banks - and other corporations - affected people individually. Zach Braff's ""Going in Style"" shows how a company lays off its workers and wipes out their pensions. No surprise that three of the laid-off employees decide to rob a bank in response.",/review/rw3679644/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Going in Style (2017) is a professionally produced crime comedy about three lifelong friends who have fallen on hard times through the loss of their pension. Their plan to fix their financial woes comes in the form of a bank robber of their own personal bank that happens to control their pension. This is the second time I have watched this film and I love it every time. It is a reminder that there are good friends in the world that will go through the business with you. It also helps that some of my favorite actors are in the film. This is an overall great film and very sound technically.",/review/rw3679644/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2017,rgkarim,7," Going Back To Traditional Style
","The age of comedy has certainly changed over the years, transitioning from the classic slapstick to a simpler, straightforward approach that today's youth loves. Yet, every once in a while, the legends from the past return in an attempt to bring some whit back to the silver screen. Tonight, my friend and I head back into the trenches of the local theater to give some insight into Going in Style starring the legendary trio of Morgan Freeman, Alan Arkin, and Michael Caine.

",Extremely ordinary comedy that relies on the charm and chemistry of its geriatric stars to elevate it beyond the quality of the writing. Any movie that gets no laughs out of Caine and Freeman getting high on weed has to be doing something wrong...,/review/rw3679644/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2017,Quinoa1984,6," Good for what it is, which is good enough (though mostly for the cast)
","So here's the thing: if you told me, out of the blue, with no context whatsoever, that there was a heist flick with Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Alan Arkin and Ann-Margaret (or you could have me at just Caine) where they plot to rob the Brooklyn bank that's screwed them over after a royal f***-over from their blue collar job, I'd say 'sign me up!' That it would also be a comedy wouldn't be so bad an enticement either; one might be reminded of something that could've starred these same actors from the 70's (ever seen The Hot Rock?) and spiked with some relevant social issues. Matter of fact, as I only recently learned, this is a *remake* of a movie from the 70's (whether it had the same horrible-bank horrible-company thing I'm sure I don't know).",/review/rw3679644/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2021,UniqueParticle,8," Can't go wrong with Zach Braff films
",One of the best and most guilty pleasure comedy/Crimes out there! I honestly don't feel today well this is such an easy delightful film to watch regardless of any feelings. A lot of charm into this heist story and that's rare in my opinion. I don't have to much to say except I highly recommend this!,/review/rw3679644/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2017,LeoAlexson,8," Zach Braff's third film
","Personally, I really like the works of Zach Braff, I fell in love with him in the series ""Scrubs"", which, thanks to the actor's play of Braff, delighted the fans for many years. Later I became interested in his first feature film ""Garden State"", which showed an unusual director's style of Braff. Then, after many years, the second film ""Wish i Was Here"" appeared, in which the matured director shared with the audience his experiences about the upbringing of children and death. Before watching ""Going in Style"" i found out that the film is a remake of the same picture released in 1979, this prompted me first to see it. Let's move on to the film itself.",/review/rw3679644/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2017,HotToastyRag,9," Hilarious and respectful
","Going in Style isn't one of those typical ""let's make fun of old people"" films. Yes, it has a few gags about old age, but the majority of the film is just about three men, who happen to have white hair. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Alan Arkin are three friends barely making ends meet. Morgan can't afford to visit his family, Michael's in danger of losing his home, and Alan clips coupons along with many other retirees whose Social Security doesn't cover all expenses. After Michael is present during a bank robbery, he comes up with the idea of robbing a bank himself, with a little help from his friends.",/review/rw3679644/?ref_=tt_urv

Three curmudgeons felt cheated by the system decide to get back with a bank robbery, another over-the-hill gang film not to be confused with anything that has Hatton Garden in the title. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Alan Arkin are partners in crime.

20 August 2017,phubbs,6," Going in Style
","I've noticed a few movies like this in recent years, you know, with a small tight-knit roster of aging A-list stars that might not be here for much longer or are simply getting too old. I know that sounds really horrible but we've all gotta face the truth about life. But its funny how these epic cast rosters only seem to happen when the stars become old, didn't see it too much back in the day. I guess that could be down to them wanting to be the only major star in their own vehicle when they were younger, hungry for fame. As they get older I guess they mellow out a bit. Just a theory.",/review/rw3679644/?ref_=tt_urv

11 April 2017,JankiSharma,9," Simple and Pleasant
","Zach Braff, one of my favorite actors/Directors/ humans...loved every episode of Scrubs, loved movies Garden State, Wish I was here and now Going in Style. 3 friends Joe(Michael Caine), Willie( Morgan Freeman) and Albert (Alan Arkin) hang out together. Joe lives with daughter and granddaughter and Willie and Albert live together. All three have their share of money and health problems. The movie is about Joe's decision to rob a bank to end money problems and how little it takes to convince Willie that the idea is good. Albert the youngest of the 3 needs a lot of convincing to join the other two and get involved. Zach Braff focuses on simple minds and simple lives. Script is simple. Really liked the way Annabelle Chow as Lucy was important in the end and John Ortiz as Jesus who respects and follows Cult principles ended the movie. Nice direction. Glad I spend 1 hr 36 minutes with pleasant characters and good story/script. I look forward to some more good movies by Zach Braff.",/review/rw3679644/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is another one of those films that I've been meaning to watch and I've only just got round to it and I have to say, I wish I had watched it sooner.
It's a lovely little film with some good laughs and great characters played by some acting greats.
While this film will never go down as one of the greats of Hollywood, it is none the less a good old fashioned comedy with a good story line.
Some of the critics are trying to poke holes in it, and to be fair there are a few little hiccups and goofs, but it's a comedy, it's not supposed to be that accurate.
Watch it for what it is, A good old school comedy, and you will enjoy it as much as I did.",/review/rw3679644/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2017,Lleuq75,7," 'Going in Style': Review
","Joyful, hilarious, touching, exciting. ""Going in Style"" fits in all these categories, proving how age does not – and should not – deprive actors of comedic spirit. Michael Cane ('Joe'), Morgan Freeman ('Willie'), and Alan Arkin ('Al') give such good performances to the point that moments of lack of subtlety – from both the script and the direction – are minimized instead of forgiven. It is a hell of a good time from beginning to end.",/review/rw3679644/?ref_=tt_urv

I'd like to see more movies like this, than the stupid standard comedy from Hollywood. I recommend everyone to see this film and have great two hours.
