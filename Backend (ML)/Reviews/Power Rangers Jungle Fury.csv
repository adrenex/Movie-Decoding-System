10 July 2014,planktonrules,6," Where is the love?!
","Often, before or after watching a film I will go to IMDb to read through the reviews to see what others think about a particular film. In the case of ""The Escape Artist"", I was rather surprised at the intensity of many of the reviews. To say that they hated the film is probably an understatement! One called it the 'by far worst show' ever to be aired on ""Masterpiece Theater"" here in the United States. Another said it had a 'dreadful story line'. Many complained that the show wasn't very believable, though some admitted that the acting and mood were good.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2014,blanche-2,7," preposterous but entertaining nonetheless
","David Tennant is a talented barrister whose big win comes back to haunt him in ""The Escape Artist,"" from 2013. Lots of negative comments here on IMDb.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2014,craig-w,6," Flawed but compelling
","As others have pointed out, there are irritating problems with logic throughout the story. But I found the show clearly worth viewing - because the dialog was great, the premise was a good one, the acting and directing were outstanding, I cared about the characters, and the ending was satisfying.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2019,Shymaa0000,9," I loved it
","This is very important. if you enjoyed this series, stop here. seriously stop. reviews here have combed the plot to within an inch of its life.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2018,BeneCumb,7," Not bad, but not among the BBCÂ´s finest
","BBC Crime has always been a certain sign of quality - I have never discontinued any of their series because of disturbing implausibility or something. On the other hand, as so many similar works are created monthly, it is evident that not all can be up to par or they just do not bespeak you as much.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2013,Lejink,6," Law makers and law breakers
","This BBC mini-series was short on credibility but pretty long on tension and suspense, helped by convincing acting and pacey direction. David Tennent, who appears to be everywhere on TV at the moment, is a hot-shot young city barrister who gets a sadistic murderer off on a technicality, but who by snubbing him after the trial wreaks a terrible fate for his family. Although an eye-witness to the horrific crime perpetrated on his wife in their holiday cottage, Tennent finds himself the biter-bit as the perpetrator turns to his chief rival in the ""Young Lawyer of The Year"" stakes, Sophie Okinedo, who also appears to be everywhere on TV at the moment, as his defence solicitor, her character's detachment and ambition now ironically reflecting Tennent's own character earlier.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2015,SuzyCayenne,2," Amazingly sloppy writing
","I watched this show last night, and woke up feeling so annoyed about the utter contempt for the intelligence of viewers that I'm moved to write this review. As other reviews have noted, the acting and tension elements are good, which makes it all the more noticeable that the writing is so woefully deficient.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2020,tamaramarkovich,10," Brilliant David Tennant
","You might love or hate this piece, however one thing is absolutely sure: David Tennant has given us some brilliant acting in this show, and even if it is for that only it deserves 10/10.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2014,beeblebrocs,5," Stylish, well acted nonsense
","I would not say this mini-series is awful. However, this is one of those ""missed opportunities"" that makes us sad because it could have been more.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2017,fourwinds4,5," Disappointing, disturbing, Excellent cast & production let down by implausible plot
","I have to agree with many of the reviewers on IMDb here : the writing lets this production down. The storyline is just not credible and after watching the first episode and the synopsis for the second and third episodes, I am not watching further.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2016,Znoodles,5," No Plausible Writing: Good Production
","As noted by previous reviewers, the thread of court logic is threadbare. However, the set design, direction, casting & soundtrack are spot on. Given that the ""artist"" is a murderer who gets away with murder, it would have been nice to see more of his macabre character explored. Of course, Mr. F is no Alice Morgan, but he is multifaceted in ways that are only alluded to by the writers.The jealous up & coming barister also has many character opportunities that we, as the audience are left wondering. For 180 mins, prepare for slightly suspenseful courtshow antics. Be entertained & don't wait for the the frown furrow to leave your brow.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2014,Astrolpdc1,5," What routinely passes for mystery/drama nowadays
","Unfortunately not all efforts can be crackerjacks and this painfully true aphorism certainly applies to The Escape Artist. In all literature, plays, teleplays, and large screen movie releases etc., there is credible suspension of belief and there is also incredible suspension of belief. The latter describes what is necessary to take this particular 'escape' ride. It appears many of the writers nowadays reflect much of the fantasy universe they grew up playing in, with their games and hand-held devices. One can write well and not feel compelled to banish all commonsensical behavior on the part of essential characters. Whether this behavior stems from major characters being shocked and taken aback when confronted by an unexpected and repugnant evil. Or worse, whether it stems from a jaded apathy and more than implied complicity with evil. But nowadays common sense and right thinking are largely absent from teleplays and Movies of this kind. I guess it is the only way for many of them to make things work anymore, such is the state of creative writing.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2016,randyruss72,10," Compelling and Not Flawed
","This is one of the finest televised dramas I have ever seen. I was watching it on the TV channel that brings us wonderful British shows, Part 1, knowing that Part 2 would be aired the next week. About and hour into the telecast, the TV went dark and I looked about and there were no lights anywhere. We were undergoing a power outage. Determined to see the entire production, I ordered the DVD which I then did as gifts for film aficionados. I had no prior introduction to the work of David Tennant but was so impressed. Learning of his amazing career is a pleasure. He admires Derek Jacobi, an actor long admired in the States beginning with ""I, Claudius."" I was privileged to have drinks with Sir Derek in Stratford in the autumn of 1982 following his stellar performance in ""The Tempest."" He continues turning out marvelous performances.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2014,Franklie,3," I expected better from Masterpiece
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS: Although the subject matter is perfect for a thriller, Masterpiece usually does a much better job. There are SO many holes in this show. Among them... Why weren't the son and wife shown photographs of possible Peeping Toms? Why in the world would the wife and son go back to the cottage? Doesn't make sense. And nothing is flowing well. Oh, and there really was no need to have such horrific torture of the first victim. We would have been horrified with much less. We're VERY glad they didn't do a torture scene. Being in the US, we've only seen the first episode, so the rest might get better. We hope so. The holes in the plot have made the whole thing a bit laughable, which helps to break the tension, which they have done a fantastic job of creating. And they've done a great job using intelligent vocabulary rather than foul language which seems to be hip these days unfortunately. Here's hoping they keep it up.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2015,lfodor-09199,10," A charming defense barrister has the perfect record of never having lost a case.
","Will Burton a junior barrister defends a man who charged with a brutal murder. This series becomes a white knuckle, tension filled drama. It is not a typical, predictable series. Extremely well written. Not only is David Tennant superb, each actor in this 6 part series delivers a great performance. The lighting, photography and sets are simply top notch. The special features (interviews) are well worth watching. They are short and informative. If you only watch American productions you will notice British productions are vastly different. In my humble opinion, British productions are superior. I'd watch this series again, which I rarely ever do! Keep an open mind if this is your first time viewing a British production. I'm sure you will become a convert after watching this riveting drama.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2020,stevenremmington,7," The Escape Artist
","Definitely an implausible storyline and utterly far fetched, but then many compelling dramas have peculiar twists, and often events would never happen in reality. So I wouldn't consider this to be a valid criticism. The principal cast are talented and accomplished, and the acting is the strongest element. The final episode seems to cram into the plot too many crucial aspects of the story that weren't suggested or introduced in any way during the preceding episodes. This gave the impression that the story was somewhat rushed towards the end. Setting out the storyline in greater depth earlier in the series would have allowed the whole thing to make more sense. However that would probably have required an additional episode, which presumably the producers wished to avoid.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2022,samthejudgeamos,8," Great watching
","Suspenseful, dark and frankly more than a bit creepy in paces. David Tennant is excellent in this. The (brilliantly cast) adversary is uncomfortable to watch,. If you took the facial features of Tim Curry, Stephen Mangan and Steve-o and removed the menacing parts from each and smooshed them all together, you would get an oddly attractive bad guy. This is him.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv

27 July 2021,prashant-63677,2," The most illogical tv.
","I will keep this short. Just imagine the most ridiculous, ill thought, dumb, bereft of common sense plot EVER. Then put that in a script, spread over 3 episodes. Then just dish out to unsuspecting victims. In a nutshell, this is my analysis of this terrible show. Most shocking & illogical tv show i ever saw, and i have seen a lot. If possible, i would have fined the makers of this tv series to insult the intelligence of their victims in such blatant manner.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2022,canuckteach,7," Passable Brit murder/legal defence thing
","Well, we love David Tennant (late of his Phileas Fogg presentation on PBS & Dr. Who, in the past). So, when this 2013 entry popped up on PBS-Prime, we jumped at the chance. Tennant plays an emerging Brit Solicitor (defence attorney) who is undefeated. Hence, he is given a case involving a nasty young man who (allegedly) ritualistically murdered a young female.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2020,Headturner1,5," not realistic
","In any way. He was such a good solicitor not. The guy who plays Foyle is a horrible actor( all he does is laugh). A better twist would have colluded with him in some way to kill his wife. Also what was Okendo so scared of? What was in her garbage can? What was that present she received? And it was just stupid when she approaches him with her big theory ""how to get away with murder"". Just boring. Not compelling in any way . Oh and the DNA missed?!? Hahaha. Gross misconduct by police throughout as well. Just wasn't believable or exciting in any way...",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2016,davvvyc,9," A Gilded Lawyer With Outrageous Bad Luck.
","Just saw first episode initially. Great suspense of a killer thriller typified by how often his lower nature is only out done by his slippery escapes in front of the screen. Enjoyed the 'slapstick of unfortunate events.' But the irony of injustices to the main character, a charming lawyer, is a numerous litany of misfortune because he's observed to be a good man but slips and slides in an outfield to be sucker punched by the killer 'for not performing a common courtesy.' I hope to see the other two episodes on TV during the showing weekly but believably real is this story because the entertainment value is more than enough to be engrossed and watch it with my girlfriends. If you need to see both sides of human nature both kind and nefarious weaved well watch this series as the Lawyer has an intimate close knit family but the killer is subtly diabolical in how deviously he murders victims. Exciting to watch but unreal in detail taken to the extreme it is though it's ironies are pleasing.",/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2022,dlxmarshall,1," Terrible
",Plot seemingly devised by a drunk 14 year old with five hours to spare otherwise preoccupied with snagging the future love of his/her life while realising he/she has an exam in the morning for which a good six hours revision is necessary . A pointless waste of three hours and better spent examining the seemingly diverse patterns on pebbledash walls. Just my opinion of course.,/review/rw8258085/?ref_=tt_urv
