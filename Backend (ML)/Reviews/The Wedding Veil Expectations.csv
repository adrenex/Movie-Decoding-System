29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Really Fun Show!
","Tacoma FD is create by Broken Lizard (the same guys that made Super Troopers, Beerfest, etc.) so if you like their humor you'll love this. It takes everything you love about those movies and they move it to a fire station. Each episode is full of laugh at loud moments. The chemistry between the cast is exactly what you want from a good comedy. I'm glad enough people like it that it keeps getting renewed. It's already going on Season 4 and more and more people seem to be catching on to how good this show is so it's not going anywhere. If you're looking for a pretty funny show where you can just turn your brain off and not think then give this a try. I've loved every minute of it so far and you probably will too. I can't wait for more to come!",/review/rw6493496/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you like Super Troopers, you'll love this - A Fire Station full of bored lunatics and their shenanigans. Watch it Meow - you won't regret it ðŸ¤£",/review/rw6493496/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of the funniest shows in the game right now. Great cast, excellent chemistry. Everything funny about Super Troopers plus a little something extra! I hope they keep it going with this one.",/review/rw6493496/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2022,STA998763,9," Way Funnier Than I Expected
","I found the show on HBO Max and have really enjoyed it. It's light hearted and funny. They've got a great cast with really good chemistry. I initially thought it would be a little more vulgar, but it's not. It's something that just about anyone can enjoy. It has an occasional edge to it, but it's usually within the bounds of a good, easy to watch sit com. I really hope they keep making episodes of it. Usually I don't catch shows like this until they've been off the air for 5+ years, so it's great to catch this one while they are still making it. Great characters, funny show, good premise. Give it a chance, you'll probably like it.",/review/rw6493496/?ref_=tt_urv

","Current career firefighter. It's so great to see a show that doesn't portray the service as a bunch of alcoholic drug addicted, brooding glory monsters. This show is awesome.",/review/rw6493496/?ref_=tt_urv

",We needed another good comedy for tv most of em are APOOPY!,/review/rw6493496/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2020,calicut110,7," This is good
","Everytime I rewatch an episode I see another new joke or something totally hilarious. Highly recommend for good, low brow humor.",/review/rw6493496/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2022,Headturner1,7," And a half
","High for me. 8-9 are rare for me and have to be spectacular and usually attr never ""just comedy"" but a mix of drama, etc like example Rescue me ( which got old after a while) that said this got better as it went on and there are some really funny moments I just wish we saw more of each of their private lives as well. I finished all of season 1 Monday and last night all of 2 but don't remember a lot because I fell asleep and they were at some party with dates when I woke. I'll go back tonight and probably start a few episodes back. I liked the beef they had going with the PD. The episode they worked together was funny SPOILERS
When he tells the ( I forget his name ) he's to small to be a male dancer and doesn't have what it takes! Hahaha! I know it's not realistic but does the FDP really come out for stuck alpaca's, women who can't walk up the stairs etc. I don't know it's pretty mindless entertainment and I like all of the characters pretty much equally but favour Sarg and granny.i don't really know what to compare it to except maybe a bit of Reno 911 ( but that show's genius). F you like shows like that and ( jeez I'm having a hard time because I don't watch much US tv) but say always sunny in PA you'll probably like this.",/review/rw6493496/?ref_=tt_urv

",I had to look for this show... it's on TruTV. Watching on the app they give the choice between a TV one and an explicit one. The one downside are commercials - I've gotten used to streaming without them.,/review/rw6493496/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2021,dnaples-72178,10," if you like broken lizard movies, this is amazing!
","I love this hilarious comedy. I am a male in my 30s, and this comedy seems to be directed towards just males. If you like broken lizard movies, like super troopers and beerfest, this is the same kind of comedy by the same actors and creators. I am so glad i can watch these guys for more than just a movie every few years now.",/review/rw6493496/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2022,adriaanjelle,8," Comedy done right.
","This is one of the only comedies that I actually like! That doesn't happen often. Sometimes it's a little too much with one particular joke, but generally speaking: this is an excellent show. Very well written. It's NOTHING like the mainstream comedy shows (Friends, Arrested Development, The Big Bang Theory, etc.), and that's a good thing, because those are booooring and not funny at all. This is great.",/review/rw6493496/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2020,lynzee3,9," pilot has lots of ""guy"" jokes but it gets better
","I almost didnt keep watching this show because of the pilot episode's jokes that guys find funny and are better on second viewing but i am glad i continued with it. it's fun and funny. yes some jokes are yuck but overall its the best streaming show i have seen, having watched it over and over probably 20 times.",/review/rw6493496/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2019,ukMogul,9," It's bloke-humor, it's pretty gross at times, but it's really very good!!
","From two of the guys who brought us the ""Super Troopers"" movies, comes this little gem of a TV series. It's raucous, it's offensive, and it's really funny! I always thought Super Troopers was sort of a slow-burn comedy - I didn't like it when I first saw it but grew to love it over time. But this series was instantly lovable with some great characters, brilliantly comical situations and plenty of absolutely hilarious moments.",/review/rw6493496/?ref_=tt_urv

6 May 2019,ginalesarmstrong,9," The ""Broken Lizard"" guys score again!
","Each episode is funnier than the last. The comedy timing and chemistry is amazing. Every character is involved to some extent in every episode. Sometime they go for the obvious joke, but mostly it's a bit off the wall, and very smart. If you like the ""Broken Lizard"" style of comedy, you'll enjoy this show. I like the fact that the on-demand feature lets you choose an ""explicit"" version.",/review/rw6493496/?ref_=tt_urv

","Not going to write a critique. However, someone earlier said ""dad humour"" and rated it 1. Well some of us are and loved Broken Lizard (Supertroopers 2 was a disappointment after the hype).",/review/rw6493496/?ref_=tt_urv

",This is probably one of the funniest shows I've seen. Each one of these episodes has me rolling. Don't pass by this and make sure you give it a watch. Since the first episode I've been addicted and it gets even better.,/review/rw6493496/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2021,kidswhoslideonfloors,10," Love this show!!
","I think this is probably one of my favorite tv shows right now. Im a fan of the super trooper movies and beerfest, but i felt like this had a slightly different vibe. I find it weirdly wholesome. I particularly loved the character of Lucy. Im a girl and i feel like they wrote her really well. It was nice to see a girl broing out like this on tv.",/review/rw6493496/?ref_=tt_urv
