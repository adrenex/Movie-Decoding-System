16 July 2016,triggergotstuffed,8," Wow! Tough Crowd!!
","When reading the previous reviews, one person complained about the title song not being the original version and 2 others complained about the show not being original. ",/review/rw7287277/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2016,jk-692-236394,9," I really like this show
","I like lighter crime procedural shows. I was sad Castle and Bones are ending. I loved Psych and Monk and shows like that or if you really want to do a throwback, McMillian and Wife and those kind of shows. There is really nothing left on like those right now. Both the lead actors, the Grandpa and the daughter are all quite good. I like Ennis Esmer from The Listener, another light crime show I miss. The premise is good and the chemistry between Jason Priestly and Cindy Sampson, (whom I have never heard of before) is good and it works. I like that they are not trying to hide Canada. I watch a ton of shows shot in Canada that try to be somewhere else. It gets annoying. This show is fun and light hearted and relaxing to watch. I hope they give it a 2nd season. Update, they gave it more than two seasons, going into season four. Very pleased. Keep up the good work. They all seem to have found their flow together and the show feels like it really found it's pace now.",/review/rw7287277/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2016,piperofthemillenium,7," Yes, it's reminiscent, but worth a look.
","The trolls are at it again. How is it that something can come along, remind us of something else and immediately it gets panned as unoriginal? There is nothing new under the sun. This quote itself is nearly 3000 years old. It was true then and it's true now. Yes, this show reminded me of Moonlighting with a dash of Castle as the remade man who considers a different career. However, it dares to consider than just ""bringing the killer to justice"". There have been resolutions to stories that I didn't see coming or consider to be regular justice. Remember, these guys are PRIVATE EYES, not cops. Justice doesn't have to include iron bars. I like the chemistry between the leads and having Jason Priestly raise a blind daughter whilst having his own dad around for a foil keeps him grounded. Not to mention that, for once, here is a show with wide appeal that is made in Canada that doesn't pretend to be somewhere else. I've enjoyed the tour of her cities and countryside without it being purported to be ""somewhere in the US"". Yes, Private Eyes does draw from ingredients we're familiar with, but then some of the greatest cocktails are made from stuff we never consider combining before. Give it a taste!",/review/rw7287277/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2019,grandmabrat,10," I love this show!!!
","I like the non-violent aspect of it. So many shows these days don't do detecting, they do shooting, shouting, punching, and yelling. Love the intelligence.",/review/rw7287277/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2018,Bobonthecouch,8," It's grown on me.
","I didn't think I was interested after the pilot episode. It seemed too gimmicky and redundant. Yeah, yet another pair of ill-suited, mismatched detectives ""forced"" to work together blah blah... But, I'm glad I watched a couple of more episodes. They made some right turns in the development of the characters and their relationships. I appreciated they toned down the macho animosity and even turned the Shade/Maz dynamic into a sort of reluctant buddy kind of thing. I'm really tired of all the hatred and competitiveness in everything you see these days. This show takes me back to the last century (I can't believe I'm old enough to say that!) and PI shows like Harry O, Rockford and Magnum (the REAL one). Lighthearted humor and a little escape from reality in a relaxing manner is a welcome change from all the explosions and shootouts and car crashes and helicopter crashes and plane crashes and military invasions and, well... you get it. Oh, did I mention all the shouting and backstabbing and assaulting and battering of the ""reality"" shows? Thanks for ""Private Eyes"". I'm glad it's still on.",/review/rw7287277/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2016,Ed-Shullivan,9," Ooo-lah-lah!
","Finally we have a gem of a television series with a well balanced crime/drama/comedy detective series that will appeal to a wide range audience base and not just one that concentrates on a murder of the week, or based on a genius detective that solves each weeks crime in the last five (5) minutes of each episode.",/review/rw7287277/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2016,nightc1,8," Finally a pure P.I. show
","There have been a lot of detective shows through the years. Some lean to being campy comedy like Moonlighting, others end up a murder of the week procedural like Castle, and others like Veronica Mars end up being side jobs they do while doing other things. Granted I LOVE all of those shows but it's been a while since there has been a good P.I. show where the characters are both actual P.I.'s with random cases to solve. Veronica Mars came the closest.",/review/rw7287277/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2019,AdrienneGrayceMusic,10," Don't pat attention to the trolls
","This show is so good that it deserves to be on a network station like Fox or ABC. Not too many people watch the ION network so its not getting the audience it deserves. Jason Priestly is great as always. When you have a show with 2 leads, the chemistry has be amazing...and theirs rightfully is. Its different than most shows in this genre. If you are lucky enough to catch the repeats on the ion network, i would recommend it. You won't be disappointed",/review/rw7287277/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2016,ashnehete,8," Cliché yet reviving!
","At first glance I really liked the show. It reminds me of Castle, the story about a father and a crime solving duo. The story lines are smooth and the comedy is natural. The most important thing here is that while it is being compared to classic shows, it has a present twist. From a personal point of few, this feels fresh to me and that's why I like it. I hope this as long run. After Castle ended, I had nothing of this genre to watch! A comedy, crime series helps in reviving my mood. Its not about the art, the originality nor the clichés for me, its about the successful characterisation which transcends the realm of the 2 dimensional television and plays out as a reality in my head. I'm giving 8/10 for just that. The show has managed to reach out to me and I would like to show my appreciation.",/review/rw7287277/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2018,bkoganbing,7," From zip code to postal code
","Jason Priestley who will forever be identified with Beverly Hills 90210 as all American Brandon Walsh for several seasons has changed his famous zip code to
a native Canadian postal code. His name certainly guarantees a bit of box office 
attraction for his new Canadian series Private Eyes. ",/review/rw7287277/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2016,lennybuttz,7," Interesting alternative to a cop show.
","I thought this sounded like a Moonlighting/Remington Steele remake but it's different. It's an unlikely couple doing P.I work but it's not as comedic or cliché as the other shows. It's a little more serious. I do like that Jason's character is a father. He working hard to be a good father. His father lives with him and his daughter. There's more debt to his character than to the Bruce Willis or Peirce Brosnan. He's more realistic even though he's a former pro hockey player. He's still cute to look at. Cindy Sampson on the other hand, she's lovely to look at but I'm not impressed with her acting. The writing's alright the stories were good, it's an entertaining show maybe with more experience Cindy will become a better actress? I'm not sure if this would be considered a spoiler; the daughter is legally blind, I admire the fact she's shown in a positive light and she's not a stereotype. I like the show, is it great art, no but I wasn't look for art, I was looking for something interesting and entertaining, this filled the bill.",/review/rw7287277/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2017,fiona_r_lamb,8," Highly enjoyable
",It's funny but I never ONCE compared this show to Moonlighting. And I watched every episode of Moonlighting back in the day.,/review/rw7287277/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2016,sidney_d_hall,9," Fun Show...hope it gets renewed
","So far the stories although not mind blowing are fresh. I'm not watching re-made versions of other mystery shows. The premise I have seen a hundred times. The male female partners, flirting and will they wont they thing. Heck it works though. ",/review/rw7287277/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2021,uajx,8," Wonderful show, weak ending
",A enjoyable 60 episode run was left to 90 seconds of the final scene to what we waited for. Kinda bummed.,/review/rw7287277/?ref_=tt_urv
