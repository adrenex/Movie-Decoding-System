24 February 2020,Leofwine_draca,6," Not bad, but too generic
","CAPTAIN MARVEL is the latest Marvel comics offering and the follow-up to AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR; inevitably it's a big step down from the success of that movie. This one goes down a much more predictable route, and it suffers hugely from having a main character who simply isn't very interesting; like Superman, her immortality and strength make her rather boring to see on screen. The film also suffers from having an unimposing villain, a crucial climactic scene openly copying RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and generic action. On the plus side: there's a nice supporting turn from a funny and de-aged Samuel L. Jackson; the material on Earth is gently amusing, riffing on the buddy-buddy genre; there's a solid and major plot twist halfway through that really works; and Brie Larson is a decent actress. But they really need to think of something more involved next time instead of this generic amnesic hero stuff.",/review/rw5002455/?ref_=tt_urv

","@Marvel scores another one with #CaptainMarvel Great origin story with great casts, great cat, and it ties back to the Avengers and Phase 1 movies! Great dogfights ala Top Gun. Great 90s throwbacks and grunge music! Do not miss the post-credits, motherflurkens! (4/5Scales)",/review/rw5002455/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2019,morrison-dylan-fan,5," Captain Meh.
","Travelling to Birmingham to get Easter presents for friends and family,I decided that whilst in the city I would go catch a film. Visiting the oldest working cinema in the UK (The Electric) I found a flick with a run time that would give me just enough time to catch the train home,so I get set to see the new captain of the MCU.",/review/rw5002455/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2019,mochteam,8," I liked it more than I thought I would
",I heard mostly complaints about the movie because of a statement that Brie Larsen never even made. The film got attacked because people chose to believe a lie someone created. It always pays to do your own research before jumping on the band wagon folks.,/review/rw5002455/?ref_=tt_urv

9 March 2019,phd_travel,2," Confusing boring childish
",The screenplay is convoluted and confusing. The beginning feels like you walked into a movie half way. When things start to get explained it's too late. The humor is unfunny and childish. Samuel L Jackson singing and playing with the cat. The story is so confusing and silly - bouncing around between Earth and the space ships and shifting shapes. Then the good guys are the bad guys.,/review/rw5002455/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2019,katieleigh422,8," Much better than it's getting credit for
","This movie was a lot better than the reviews have been giving it credit for. It might not end up being the most memorable movie in the scheme of things, but it was a LOT of fun and Brie Larson is really satisfyingly badass. In a lot of ways, with its tone, a plot twist or two, and the concurrent flashback storyline, it didn't feel like a Marvel movie in that very specific paint-by-numbers way that these movies can go. In addition to being set in the 90s, it reminded me a lot of a movie I would've seen in the 90s - with its buddy cop tone, cheesy but heartwarming inspirational lines, and the after-school special messages of fairness and friendship - all on that gargantuan Marvel budget.",/review/rw5002455/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2019,Merlin-Knight,8," My Two Cents
","I have to be honest I saw a great many ratings of 1 or 2 and I find myself confused at how people rated it so low. I found the movie to be quite entertaining myself. It was almost as good as the first iron man movie and there are some parallels that can be seen between the characters in regards to their attitudes.
I can't help but feel I watched a totally different movie then the other did.",/review/rw5002455/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2020,Lis_G,9," Enjoyable movie! Top Marvel film.
","I really enjoyed this film and it's one of the best Marvel films, in my opinion. Love the 80s/90s references. Good characters (Brie does a fantastic job in the title role and Samuel is great as always), and well-written storyline -particularly with how Agent Fury links in and how it all fits with the Marvel universe. Film moves along at a decent pace, no boring bits, and some humourous parts too, thanks to Goose!",/review/rw5002455/?ref_=tt_urv

12 March 2019,sebastiansallingkierkegaard,8," Really enjoyable film!
","""Captain Marvel"" is not perfect in any way, but it's fun and entertaining. I think Beer Larson is great as Captain Marvel/Carol Danvers. Samuel L. Jackson is also great as always. The humour is spot on, and the score by Pinar Topeka is fantastic! I think this is a great movie in the MCU, no matters the controversy surrounding it!",/review/rw5002455/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2019,johnc2141,9," Why the negative reviews?
",Ok I had recently seen Captain Marvel kind of late like from redbox. Missed it at the theater. I really enjoyed it a lot. I like Brie Larson I think she is very good in the role.I was confused because I thought captain Marvel was a DC character so they renamed it Shazam. Which I didn't see but back in the 40s they had a serial called Capt Marvel aka shazam. Anyway this is a great MCU movie and the post credit scenes there is 2 by the way. Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury. Finally get to learn how he lost an eye. No spoilers but it's a lot of great special effects and Capt Marvel proves to be a superhero to be reckoned with as she battles aliens. Also in the cast is Jude Law and Anette Benning .So really what's up with the bad reviews why all the haters. This movie is a real joy to behold .,/review/rw5002455/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2019,grantpaulsen,2," Honestly, I was hoping for better.
","This is a very controversial Marvel film. Which seems to be a running trend with Disney films recently. The hype around this film seems to be very mixed, some want it to succeed and some want it to fail, and both sides seem to have these viewpoints due to various political reasons. There seems to be a lot of agendas involved. I do not have any stake in either side because I do not care about this kind of thing when it comes to film. I don't think it's fair to judge films from that perspective in a positive or negative way. In the same sense that I don't think it's fair to judge a film from a positive or negative perspective based on whether or not you like the actors involved. I don't care if films succeed or fail financially. Film is an art form to me and I just want to see films that are well-made by people who have a lot of passion for their craft.",/review/rw5002455/?ref_=tt_urv

","I enjoy this movie more every time I watch it. I believe those who rated it poorly should watch it again.
But, Ben Medelsohn's performance was superb !
The writers and the director did a nice job.",/review/rw5002455/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2019,dianamarinelli,8," I don't really get the hate it's not that bad
",I had low expectations going to see this movie because everyone was hating on it but it's not that bad I think it was a good superhero backstory and there is not a lot of feminism in the movie. The acting and the story lines were good.,/review/rw5002455/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2019,vithiet,7," Really wanted to like it more, it's just ok
","So I was hoping this would be a great movie and I could write a review telling misogynists to shut up because it's fantastic to have a strong female superhero as a lead character. Alas, in that regard Wonder Woman did a lot better as a movie as a whole.",/review/rw5002455/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2019,riteshk-71503,8," Mar-Vell-Ous
","Captain Marvel is a fun movie to watch. Although the film is not very exceptional but it's definitely enjoyable. There are some great scenes and humor. Samuel L. Jackson was excellent with the jokes and sarcasm. Captain Marvel has everything you'd expect of a Marvel movie. Action, comedy and betrayal it had everything.",/review/rw5002455/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2019,therockyroy,8," This is an entertaining ride of GIRL POWER..!!!
","It a entertaining ride because some people are getting to much of problem. It had some problems but not mean it a flop. It reminds 1994 wibe real to much fun.
It not love a story not a drama movie it a fun ride of jampacked entertainment. Lots of people are it a politics movie but it not. It a fun ride with new galaxy police does how don't know she is a galaxy police. Captain Marvel is a galaxy police..",/review/rw5002455/?ref_=tt_urv
