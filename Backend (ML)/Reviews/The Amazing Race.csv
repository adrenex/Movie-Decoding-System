",I'd really love to tell you about the plot. I really would! But I would struggle to pull all the multitude of strands together from J.K. Rowling's story and coherently explain them to anyone. If Rowling had put ten thousand monkeys (not a million - it's no bloody Shakespeare) into a room with typewriters and locked the door I wouldn't be surprised.,/review/rw4463062/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2018,Gordon-11,," I don't understand the story
","The visuals are great, but there is no story. The film is just a collage of scenes with strange creatures appearing for no reason at all. The vast number of characters don't help to make the plot any easier to decipher. The only scenes that I enjoyed are the ones in Hogwarts. That's because at least I know what they are about.",/review/rw4463062/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2020,eric262003,5," The Sole Purpose To Milk In Other Sequels
","The first ""Fantastic Beasts"" film can easily stand alone as engaging new series for the viewers who are still hungry for new material in the world author J.K. Rowling created which is the Wizarding World. And sure we were told in advance that we were going to get five more movie adaptations in the future, I was excited about seeing this spin-off from the very successful Harry Potter films that came out between 2002-2012. Sure not everyone liked ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", I managed to find it ever so enjoyable as a welcome addition to the Wizarding World. It may sound like a cliche what I'm about to say, but ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Griendelwald"" failed to live up to the standards that the first installment measured up to. I can't remember a time when a movie like this was so muddled, watching what could gave been a simple viewing pleasure would end up so labouring.",/review/rw4463062/?ref_=tt_urv

","In 1927 New York City, evil wizard Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) escapes a prison transport and heads to Paris with his supporters. In London, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) refuses British Ministry of Magic's command to hunt Grindelwald. It's revealed that it was Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) who sent Newt to NYC and this time he sends him to Paris. Newt is joined by Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler). Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) is already there searching for lost pure-blood wizard Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) along with everyone else.

","The one thing this movie successfully does, is cast an obliviate on you. I literally just watched it, and I don't even remember what it's about. The magical element of this film is simply having so much happen, while simultaneously, nothing really happens.",/review/rw4463062/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2019,MissSimonetta,2," Even The Last Jedi wasn't this incompetent
","THE LAST JEDI is often reviled as far as recent blockbusters go, but at least the editing was competent and the story, while problematic and too eager to shock at the expense of logic or characterization, was coherent. THE CRIMES OF GRINDELWALD cannot claim any of these modest skills. The opening escape scene is a masterpiece of horrible editing, camerawork, and lighting. And it all goes downhill from there.",/review/rw4463062/?ref_=tt_urv

1 March 2019,ButtStuffWerewolf,5," Great cast, stunning visuals and cinematography and totall boring
","Watching this gives you the sense that nobody really knew where to go after the first film ended... and it shows. Beautiful film with a great cast, but an ultimately pointless story that sort of flops around like a dead fish not quite aware yet that its dead. This film is disappointing and forgettable.",/review/rw4463062/?ref_=tt_urv

8 December 2018,ThomasDrufke,2," Bland, Confusing, and Convoluted
","I generally hate writing a review about a movie/tv episode that I hate. It feels like a waste of energy, especially knowing that there are plenty of people out there who genuinely enjoy this film series, but I'm just not one of them. I LOVE the Harry Potter movies and grew up with those 8 films, but I've never felt the connection to the Fantastic Beasts series that I did to Potter. It's not necessarily fair to make that comparison but alas, there's virtually nothing good about the Crimes of Grindelwald. Confusing, convoluted, and at times way too convenient for its own good, the film has nothing to grapple onto emotionally. In fact, the one decent thing about the first film (Queenie and Jacob) is entirely ruined in this film's third act. Disappointingly, the film has almost pushed aside the beasts side of the series completely, in exchange for a cliched villain with Grindelwald, who severely lacks in originality. Admittedly, I found myself lost for most of the runtime. Until they inevitably put out ""Cursed Child"" in 15 years, this may be it for me with this universe.",/review/rw4463062/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2020,Hayden-86055,4," What a letdown!
","An overly confusing film, the plot flies from one moment to another and we're introduced to characters that contribute absolutely nothing to the plot. Furthermore, a lot of the characters we were introduced to in the previous film are all muddled up. Queenie allies herself with Grindelwald; a child murdering genocidal maniac. Are we meant to be relating to her?",/review/rw4463062/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2019,studioAT,1," A weak entry to the wizarding world

2 February 2020,Leofwine_draca,3," Dreadful money grab
","THE CRIMES OF GRINDELWALD is the FANTASTIC BEASTS follow-up that nobody asked for, but I guess there's more money yet to be made from the wizarding world. This turns out to be of the same quality as the first film, i.e. quite dreadful, and it doesn't help that Rowling herself turned in the screenplay. It's unfocused, meandering, almost plotless at times, with way too many uninteresting characters, none of whom appeal. As usual, the emphasis is on delivering snazzy CGI effect after snazzy CGI effect, but this gives the whole thing a real detachment from reality that makes it vapid to watch. Cast-wise, Redmayne is the worst he's ever been, while Johnny Depp's stock villain feels sleazy rather than menacing. It's also one of those mid-series films that has no real beginning, middle or end, and as such feels completely pointless.",/review/rw4463062/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2019,ajzeg,1," When I first saw the trailers for this movie, I thought it was going to suck. But, once I sat down and watched the movie, much to my surprise...I was right.
","This is probably my least favourite movie of the year. There are way too many characters with way too many subplots going on all at once, the villain was horribly miscast, everything was confusing and didn't make sense, the story was unfocused and pointless, there was way too much pointless fanservice, everything looked grey, it was BORING, and the whole thing only exists to set up sequels! So, yeah, this one's pretty bad. It's a new low for Warner Brothers and this franchise, and....hold on, wait a minute, there must be a mistake. I'm listing off all the reasons that I hated Batman v Superman, not Fantastic Beasts 2. Oh? They both have the exact same problems? Okay then! Screw this movie! I sure as hell am not seeing the next one until it comes out on demand! They have officially lost my interest!",/review/rw4463062/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2018,TheLittleSongbird,7," A lot of fantastic elements but not quite fantastic enough overall
","Am something of a fan of Harry Potter, books and films. Having grown up with the franchise and cherishing the fond memories being engrossed in the books, the midnight shopping trips to get the latest one and watching the films in the cinema being entertained, dazzled and at times even scared. Found myself really enjoying the first 'Fantastic Beasts' film, though not all my friends and family did for understandable reasons.",/review/rw4463062/?ref_=tt_urv

14 November 2018,Tom0610,6," Stunning movie, but where was the plot..?
","Let me start off by saying that I am a big Harry Potter fan; I loved all 8 HP movies, and really liked the 1st installment of Newt's adventures as well.
This movie just didn't really do the trick for me. There was absolutely nothing to complain about visually; the movie was even more stunning than the first one, with even more beautifully designed 'Beasts'. And as many other people have mentioned, as a Harry Potter fan, you just can't hate this movie. Where Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them only contained a handful amount of references to the Harry Potter series, The Crimes of Grindelwald has tonnes. Enough to hype up any Harry Potter fan.",/review/rw4463062/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2018,maiajay13,4," More focused on franchise building than telling a good story!
","As both a lover of the Harry Potter Universe and a lover of movie going, I was thoroughly disappointed, even angry with this movie. While the visuals are as magical as ever, it's clear that the filmmakers are so distracted by trying to build a franchise that they're forgetting to actually tell a good story! The chemistry between our main four heroes was diluted by so many new characters being introduced. With so many new people and also so many questions for our old heroes, there wasn't enough time for any kind of (explainable) character development or for the viewers to connect with anyone on the screen. The only ""character development"" with one of our main heroes felt random and out of character and we aren't given much reason or warning for this change. I was also very disappointed with the writing behind Tina's character as her role was demoted from a strong willed Auror and woman to merely a side kick and love interest. Huge and important elements of the story were left for us only to assume what had happened when discussing the one year time jump between the two films (like the Jacob/Queenie relationship, Jacobs memory, etc.). As a whole, the film screamed ""money hungry"" and ""franchise building"" rather than letting us really connect with the characters. It also seemed as if they were only adding in twists that would surely get a reaction from viewers despite the fact that they not only discredited the original Harry Potter films, but just felt like unrealistic and a little too convenient! In short, as a huge fan of the Harry Potter Universe, I was disappointed, upset and felt really let down, and as a film goer, I was confused with the plot and frustrated with the lack of character connection and development! The only reason I have given a 4/10 instead of a 1 is for Eddie Redmayne's perfect execution of the shy, socially awkward but loveable and charming Newt Scamander and for the alluring performance from Jude Law's Dumbledore who leaves us wanting to know more of his history! But in the end, it was a huge disappointment as a stand-alone movie.",/review/rw4463062/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2018,mshackletonchavez,2," Most Disappointing Film Of The Year.

14 November 2018,bagelisa,4," What a DISGRACE to the magical world of JK Rowling..
","If I were to describe this movie with one word , I would say it was a ""Filler""
It was only after the movie that i was informed that the Fantastic Beasts ""franchise"" is going to be a 5 movie one . After I learned that , this movie's purpose became so clear to me .
I just watched a 2-hour movie in which the main characters had NOTHING to do with the plot AT ALL . This movie was all about Grindelwald finding Credence and convincing him to join his army so Credence would kill Dumbledore in the future .
Newt , Tina , Jacob and Quennie did nothing in this movie but couple-fighting and catching maybe 1 or 2 magical creatures.
We got to follow a story about Newt's childhood love , which led to absolutely nothing . The main characters just made it to the right place at the right time to spectate the end of the movie in which Grindelwald finds Credence , convinces him to join his army and boom , that is the movie . The only thing that Newt did is stealing the ""blood-bond"" between Grindelwald and Dumbledore by using the Niffler.
All in all , it was a really poor movie , the plot was shallow and it was totally a filler . It just gave us a little bit of magic but that's it . I give it a 4 only because i am a huge Harry Potter fan . This movie made me really unhappy by seeing my favorite magical world being milked for money . We don't really need 5 movies with the 2 being fillers , all we needed was 3 magical rides to the Harry Potter world . Thanks for reading this . 4/10",/review/rw4463062/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2018,peacedisturber,8," Slightly conflicted about potential plot holes and a couple forced lines, otherwise-well done
","This movie was definitely more in line with the spirit of where the series is heading-the first Fantastic Beasts was a little fluffy. I liked the tone, I liked the pacing and the backstories. I liked the expositions of new characters. I am super interested to learn more about how Nagini's story will her to being the right hand man of Voldemort. I felt like a couple lines were forced, such as ""Grindelwald doesn't value that which is simple."" I get that it was a recall to what Dumbledore says about Voldemort to Harry, but I felt like there was no motivation for that line since Newt would've had no reason to say this based on Newt's experiences with Grindelwald. There were some interesting things that could potentially set up some plot holes in the Potterverse. And I would say that I am not worried at all, but Cursed Child made plenty of mistakes in terms of plot direction that cheapened or poked holes in the Potterverse.",/review/rw4463062/?ref_=tt_urv
