5 September 2022,arod_85,7," I don't understand the hate
",I mean this movie isn't going to become an iconic romcom of the decade. Of course it's cheesy but it's no different than most movies in its genre. It's far better than anything on Hallmark. Kat and Tom make a great looking tv couple and the Italian setting is beautiful. My only complaint is Kat's outfits! She is an extremely beautiful woman and why in the world she got stuck in the clothes she did was beyond me! They had so many opportunities to put her in a beautiful cocktail dress or evening gown and instead they dressed her like an adult toddler. I did feel like the two had chemistry despite other reviews.,/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2022,skpn123,1," Never have I ever......
",Never have I ever watched such an inane and stupid film with middle aged people behaving like the 12 year olds at Summer camp reminiscent of the 'Parent Trap'.,/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2022,redx1708,4," Another two hours you won't get back.
","Another run of the mill romcom, but what can you expect. I totally agree with the reviewer above, and the only reason that I rate it one more star, is that I reviewed another romance flick yesterday and gave it 3 stars, and this one is slightly better. (Which is not saying much). It seems that every romcom that takes place in Italy, has to include at least one insane driver, and sure, we got one here too.",/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2022,cmalek98,4," Wanted to love this
","I'm a huge fan of these Hallmark type romantic, feel good, always set in a beautiful location, happy ending movies. The scenery was stunning, wish I was there! The main issue though, was that the leads had absolutely zero chemistry. I never really cared about either one of them, which is a shame, because I like them both individually as actors. I never believed either was ever interested in the other, and didn't care if they would end up together or not. I ended up skipping through most of the second half. I was so bummed because I really needed a good rom-com today. Unfortunately, this wasn't it.",/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2022,rogerstoryteller,2," Two unlovable people improbably find love
","Note to scriptwriters: don't waste the first half of your film making your two leads unattractive, petty self absorbed characters. Whether they sort it out or continue to vindictively spoil each other's stay in Verona one couldn't care less. Having taken so long to make them so thoroughly unlikable, the writer then has to desperately race against time to make them suddenly realise that they can't live without each other in order to share the obligatory kiss conclusion. This is all as fake and stomach churning as the fake horsemeat pasta prank in the show!",/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,brainwerx-1,4," mediocre is being kind
","I like Tom Hooper, and frankly it would have been better if there was a different female lead actor. She was the typical American tourist, fish out of water. It was a purely predictable movie and you can feel your brain cells dying as you watch it.",/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2022,wertpolos,1," You already know how bad this is
","OK, so this truly is awful, but you already knew this when you decided to watch a no-budget Netflix romcom.",/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,Kingslaay,6," Light hearted rom com
","This is an easy watch and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Seeing the trailer and synopsis you should kind of know what to expect. This is not a Oscar contender. You know it's a light romantic comedy which should follow a certain path. The Romeo and Juliet symbolism is driven strongly, I wish they lightened up on this a bit, a mention now and then would have been fine. The comedy is hit and miss, sometimes it lands and sometimes it falls flat. The two leads are likeable enough and do their bit to carry the film.",/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2022,brunoamserra,8," Nice movie to a 2h chillout
",I dont understand the 1 and 2 reviews. Maybe people from competition just to talk **** about netflix? Or maybe that kind of people who needs to watch 10 movies to like 1..,/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2022,dorisdalea-91223,4," Watch Letters to Juliet instead
","Letters to Juliet is set in Verona, it is about Juliet but in a less obnoxious way and the protagonist doesn't try to murder the love interest or endanger his job, doesn't do property damage and doesn't make a fake call to the police. Charlie gets back at her by taking out her diary pages and hanging them on the walls of Juliet's House.",/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2022,Catocala,3," There are better ways to spend your time on
","This movie replicates every other romcom cliché there is. An awefully timed break-up between a guy who is obviously not appreciative of a girl, girl goes to find herself, meets guy nr 2 who seems annoying at first, but obviously will become the perfect match before the end of the movie, with one crisis happening that threatens the happy end, but of course love will conquer.",/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,mariannelindbeck-03817,8," I loved it!
","With so many serious movies and shows coming out, this was lightharted, real and unrealistic at the same time, and I loved it. Why can't we hav a little fun with these movies?",/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2022,cgvsluis,7," Looking for the right kind of weird...sweet Verona, romantic comedy.
","There was a lot of comedy in this romantic comedy about a grade school teacher who has planned and waited her whole life to visit Verona...home to her beloved Juliet, for which she finally has the tickets. She has a laminated trip planned and scheduled for her and her boyfriend Brandon when he freaks out and breaks up with her. Julie ends up going on her trip alone...which starts as one disaster after another. She has a screaming kid kicking her seat on the flight, they loose her luggage, her Uber driver is Uberto...and the Villa she booked for the week is double booked to an unrelenting Brit named Charlie!",/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,Mabkid,5," Didn't feel the chemistry
","Romcoms can be cute. Usually, it starts off light and humorous, then hits you with the magic, and leaves you in sad-happy tears in the back end.",/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2022,untilnow99,6," Not the Worst. It's Kinda B-movie, but Watchable
","First off, I'd like to say that Kat Graham is totally miscast in this part. She's 5'2"" tall and Tom Hopper is a giant, at 6'5"". But it's not only the disparity in height ----- Kat needs a few more acting lessons. (Sorry, Kat.) Some of her facial expressions (and Tom's, too) were a bit over the top.",/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,rfbjryfx,1," The movie that shouldnt have seen light.
","Terrible and Unlikeable characters, bad costumes -even the supposedly bad ones were better than the actual ones. Epic fail - Mediocre acting, predictable storyline, forced ending, cliché stereotypes, interesting locations and the 1 star is for the brilliant cinematography.",/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2022,moniquesashe,4," Unnecessarily violent: could have been better
","They trump up Kat Graham's character, Julie as ""weird"" when in actuality, Julie is most likely a psychopath. She lacks impulse control and gives into her violent and manipulative urges. Changing the locks was fine but calling the police over getting an apartment was not. Neither was forcing a severe allergic reaction and sure as hell not throwing a plate at a wall. None of these things were okay, they were abusive. If you're not convinced, imagine Charlie (Tom Hopper) doing all the things Julie did. Just because she is a tiny lady doesn't mean she can do whatever the hell she wants.",/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2022,koolhandkarl,7," Familiar with its own cute quirks

3 September 2022,anamariamicheli,1," Worse than Bad
",Whoever cast that woman for a lead? From the opening scene the acting is so bad she makes her character a 13 year old caricature. Shakespeare's Juliet was 13 years old but behaved more maturely than this middle aged entitled brat.,/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,angeliquedecock,10," Funny and romantic
",I really laughed a lot. Their dislike and pranks really were very funny.,/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2022,nautuul,8," I laughed so hard, the movie was very fun and enjoyable. It is pretty nice to watch together with family, when you can laugh together, with some snacks and drinks.
","I watched with my cousins and we loved it. The acting was pretty good. Super good looking male and female characters. It was very relaxing to watch, like if you want to enjoy something, relax your mind, feel good. This is perfect for an chill evening after a long day at work.",/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,hallmarkmov,4," Another Netflix flop
","If you are really bored and have run out of hallmark movies to watch this may be the movie for you. But be warned- set your bar super low. So much potential and yet it flopped right away. A typical fast talking lead character gets dumped and goes on her dream vacation anyways, only to be stuck in an double booked vacation home. They don't get their money back and it seems the guy is there first so it's his but he's nice enough to let the girl stay. What does the girl do in return? She tries to destroy him and force him out- even getting him arrested which causes him to lose his job. Instead of this elaborate plan that went on for half of the movie, why don't you keep to yourself and stick to your scheduled prebooked events? What about all the tours and restaurant bookings? She gave them up in less than a day! What kind of grade 3 teacher teaches Romeo and Juliet to her 8 year old students who really do not care? And yet goes on and on about what a wonderful person she is because she is a teacher and was dumped? I had no sympathy for her and thought she was 100% at fault and she should have been locked out and kicked out of the apartment but ofcourse that wouldn't happen. I found her character so annoying and unlikeable. I actually liked her ex and the guy's ex more than the main couple! I'm not sure how she makes so much money as a grade school teacher to afford all those expensive clothes that she seems to have thrown out when returning for her flight home- she had two small bags and that's it. I think the vacation was meant to be 1 week? And the guy was there for like a one day wine conference? But the movie seemed like a month long. It really dragged and the beautiful scenery shots were so short and quick. I would have preferred to watch the cats more than these two.",/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,deesestone,1," Dumb, dumber, no -- Dumbest!
","This movie reminded me of Emily in Paris, except of course it is set in Italy. However like Emily in Paris, it manages to hit every cliche about Italy and Italians so in that sense they are equal - wait, I think the fashion in the Emily movie was slightly better not by much, but still better than Love in the Villa. The main actress wears the same very unflattering style of dress throughout the movie but really that is the least of the problems with this movie. The whole premise is unbelievably stupid; the two protagonists have zero chemistry, the guy looks like a Ken doll and acts like him; there is just nothing appealing about either of them. I kind of preferred the dumped boyfriend and girlfriend to tell the truth. A real waste of time even if you have nothing to do.",/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,apryla-58795,5," Get a whole new wardrobe on an elementary school salary
","These romantic Netflix movies are bad but the acting isn't the problem here - it's the stupid scenario and the proceeding situations the writing put them into. Ok first of all-the breakup after four years together right before a huge trip. Not original at all. Second - her apartment at the beginning was beautiful but she's an elementary school teacher and they don't make that much money so that was unrealistic. I get that she had been planning this trip for awhile and no doubt saving but she loses her luggage and she can afford to go out and buy a whole new boutique wardrobe complete with matching shoes, jewelry and purses?! No! That's just irresponsible. Also she never loses that full face of award ceremony ready makeup.",/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2022,darthsteele-39338,1," This isn't a review it's a cautionary warning
","*DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE* The only reason I sat through this entire train wreck was to procrastinate cleaning my house. That, and I remained hopeful that they would actually show parts of Italy. Spoiler, scenic Italian backdrops are minimal! Just another no budget Netflix throw-away. Uninteresting, excruciatingly predictable, cookie cutter, drab, horribly acted. The only positive take away is the music. Just watch ""Letters to Juliet"" instead.***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************",/review/rw8518318/?ref_=tt_urv
