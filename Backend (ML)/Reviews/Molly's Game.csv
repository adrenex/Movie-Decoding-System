24 February 2016,Leofwine_draca,10," Pure action spectacle
","MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is the finest piece of pure action spectacle that I've watched since THE RAID 2 and JOHN WICK. It feels like the MAD MAX film that George Miller always wanted to make, and in many ways it's a virtual remake of MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR, except with a grossly inflated budget and CGI effects used to enhance rather than dominate. Now, I love THE ROAD WARRIOR and always will, but MAD MAX: FURY ROAD truly is an action film for our times.",/review/rw3237851/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2015,ivo-cobra8,10," Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015. Mad Max: Fury Road is the finest blockbuster of 2015!
","When I wrote this review 3 years ago I had no idea how many people hate this movie and they are preferring Mad Max 3 over this film. Claming Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the third film is better film than this, really? Better than this? Listen folks it has no Mel Gibson so what? So what's your point? Gibson dropped out this film and he wasn't interested, it was in development for years, since in 2004 this movie was announced. George Miller did something different with this film and he got hate for it. I hate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome to death! It is rated PG-13 family film and I wanted an action bloody rated R film not a boring stupid lame fu**** movie! I got an rated R bloody action film that I wanted in Mad Max: Fury Road. I was entertained and I enjoy it. ",/review/rw3237851/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2015,Hitchcoc,5," It Never Stops
","I have to say that I tried really hard to like this. But my old fashioned ""There needs to be a story and interesting characters"" mode took over. It took about fifteen minutes to figure out who was who. Apparently, the guy with the death mask and the tubes was seen as a god, that there was some religious following. Could be interesting, I guess. But what follows is one chase after another with every conceivable vehicle that some guy could dream up. There were porcupine cars. Monster trucks. Guys on poles dropping into vehicles. There was no logic presented as to why one vehicle would have a spear thing thrown at it and explode while others were hit with heavy artillery and seemed to move on just fine. Then we have Mad Max who is a captive with a mask that looks like a 1955 Oldsmobile grill. He is put on the front of a vehicle as all this combat goes on. Unfortunately, he has absolutely no personality whatsoever. There was never any suspense in this film because the place they were trying to get to was never really in our mind's eye. Then there's the short crop haired female which seems to be a standard these days. Make her look masculine and she becomes more formidable. Anyway, it is spectacular to look at but when it was over I felt no emotion or satisfaction at all.",/review/rw3237851/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2015,Uriah43,5," Extremely Inflated
","Like the previous ""Mad Max"" movies this film takes place in a future desert world which has been devastated by a nuclear war. What remains of humanity is both primitive and barbaric and those who have survived exist with the most basic of necessities in war-like fortresses where few laws exist. That being the case, after being taken as a prisoner, it is to one of these harsh enclaves that ""Max"" (Tom Hardy) is subsequently forced to endure. And since life has very little value Max ends up as nothing more than a human blood bank for one of the militaristic ""War Boys"" by the name of ""Nux"" (Nicholas Hoult). It's at this same time that one of the military leaders named ""Imperator Furiosa"" (Charlize Theron) decides to escape from this citadel and she takes with her five wives of the religious leader, ""Immortan Joe"" (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Soon all of the clans in the entire area are summoned to assist in the recapture of Imperator Furiosa with both Nux and his captive Max in hot pursuit and leading the charge. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that those who enjoy films which feature action from start to finish will really appreciate this picture. However, it is this strength which also happens to be the films weakness as there is very little room for anything else. That said, I thought the talents of both Tom Hardy--and in particular Charlize Theron--were terribly wasted. Likewise, I also believe that the current IMDb score of 8.4 (whether by chance or design) is extremely inflated as well. To that end, I would hope that once the initial euphoria has subsided realism will set in and the score will more closely resemble the film's actual merits. Time will tell. In any case, while I certainly do not believe that this particular film is deserving of scores equal to classics like ""Gone with the Wind"", I also don't consider this to be a bad movie either. Accordingly, while my score may not be popular at this time I have rated this movie as I see it. Average.",/review/rw3237851/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2015,CalRhys,," What A Lovely Day!
","The rationale behind the success of 'Fury Road' predominantly lies with director George Miller whose commitment and love for the film series that he's been developing since its first outing in 1979 is evident throughout, and it's pretty obvious that he knows how to craft a damn fine action sequence. Without this passion, the film would have likely stooped as there's not much else in the way of a plot or character development, even though Theron tries her hardest to give us an enthralling new action heroine to be revered. Aside from the aforementioned writing setbacks, 'Fury Road' is a powerhouse in the technical categories. With stunning contradictory cinematography from John Seale giving us a post-apocalyptic world of lavish colour rather than your typical muted tones, a heart-pounding score from Junkie XL and exquisite production design work that rightfully earnt the film an Oscar (one of six) for its spectacular vehicle design.",/review/rw3237851/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2015,stephendaxter,10," An absolutely insane action film that will blow you away
","Mad Max Fury Road is George Miller's return to the franchise he started way back in 1979 with Mad Max. I will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh** insane. It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don't, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful.

10 September 2015,planktonrules,8," Well made and mindlessly entertaining....
","""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is not the sort of film I enjoy and I after watching it, I am not a huge fan though I deeply respect the filmmakers. The reason I even saw it was the insane reaction the public had to this one...and the critical reviews were all surprisingly good. I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about...and try to understand why folks liked it so much. My take on it is that if you enjoy a film that is non-stop amazing action, then this one is for you. As far as the story goes, it's plot is super-thin--but the movie is handled so well and the stunts so amazingly insane that you don't mind. Worth seeing--but I sure wouldn't like to see a lot of films like this. Additionally, it was VERY refreshing to see a film where so many women are NOT mindless objects to be killed or protected--several are about as strong and heroic as Max himself--and no doubt this is why women seemed to like the film so much.",/review/rw3237851/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2015,phd_travel,2," An endless ugly chase in the desert

16 May 2015,confrank,10," Mad Max Fury Road: A statement to embarrass and destroy all other movies in the action genre
","Mad Max: Fury Road, starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, is George Miller's attempt to reignite his long dormant Mad Max franchise...and my god does he ever. For the past decade or so, with exceptions such as John Wick, The Bourne Trilogy, and The Raid, action movies seem to be struggling to capture the excitement and enjoyment the genre once held; a tenacity that classics from the 80's and 90's had in spades. George Miller single handedly delivers our saving grace with Fury Road on the back of a spike covered oil rig with a blind zombie playing a fire breathing electric guitar.",/review/rw3237851/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2015,prospectus_capricornium,9," Dark Yet Visually Exhilarating. Beautifully Brutal and Yet Still Visceral
","Even at the beginning, there's no hint MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is going to a stop. Right at the very start, the engines are already rewing, gathering furious fires of vengeance and redemption, and before the audience could snap out of the sheer moments of brutal grittiness and exhilarating high-octane drama, they are surely already held hostage within the confines of a post-apocalyptic world, where everything is horrendously scarce. Not that it's a bad thing, no it's not. I tell you, this is like being hurled into the space in a roller-coaster ride. It's dangerous, but it's also thrilling. Witnessing this dystopic world and all its hellish drama unfold might make you grope for seatbelt under your seat.",/review/rw3237851/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2015,punishable-by-death,9," A blockbuster that dark, gritty, brutal and bloody? Right here.
","I was left speechless when this finished. It can be hard to describe  indeed.... but I'll go for it...  Sheer madness that isn't sullied by bad acting or laughable lines. A  blockbuster that is gritty and doesn't have a sense of humour that  could be equated to a fluffy kitten. No 'lets all hug' sentimental BS.  This is seriously a movie I thought I'd never see: a CGI-filled  blockbuster that I flat out loved. The stunts are so much fun, the FX  so great, it is the first movie I have seen where I have thoroughly  enjoyed all this type of stuff - probably because the cinematography  for once doesn't suffer cos of it. It is all incredibly shot.  The action is so brutal and appropriately high-octane. I thought to  myself more than once, 'I think I am loving this more than Terminator  2' but other than that, there wasn't time to think. It kicked off fast  and barely stopped, and the lulls were amplified by the insanity  preceding them. Plus it is a dark film, which made it even better. I  many people do an Aussie accent even close to well, was Hardy actually  trying for that? Either way, he didn't talk much so it didn't really  matter. This is more Theron's movie than Hardy's, he doesn't say much  and does next to nothing for the first third or so. Theron's Furiosa is  more of the hero is the story, if there were to be a hero in such a  grisly and dark world.  I don't even like this type of movie but the execution is  everything. I'm gonna go see this again, soon. 4.5/5",/review/rw3237851/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2015,Theo Robertson,6," Nothing More Than A Noisy Blockbuster
","I love post apocalyptic fiction . John Wyndham and John Christopher are amongst my favourite authors . They weave compelling stories of average everymen surround by a hostile landscape where it's every man for himself and only the cruelest and most heartless survive . George Miller's MAD MAX films are an extention of this . Low brow cinematic spectacle but fair as entertainment goes . And let's not forget hugely influential as well . Sadly the films' influence found itself being transplanted in nearly every post apocalypse story for the next 20 years where a brooding loner , a man of few words , drives through a desert landscape doing his best to survive in a hostile world against scavengers . Influntial but rather unimaginative and the movies probably did the sub-genre more harm than good . This reboot did capture my imagination via the trailers and so decided to give the film a chance , not least because as soon as it was released it shot to number 25 on the IMDb Top 250 ",/review/rw3237851/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," One of the greatest action films
","George Miller elevates action and violence to a true art form in this remake of a classic. The film is a gripping full adrenaline race across the desert of a post-apocalyptic future. The action sequences are mesmerizing and the work of a true master craftsman in action. What is perhaps the most enthralling part of the film is the absolutely absurd story and world building. Miller created a fantasy world where men playing flame throwing guitars and leaping through high speed chases on pull-vaults seems like a typical milk run. The movie keeps a relentless action pace that makes all of the absurdity seem so completely ordinary, which might be the real magic of this movie. This is only really possible because the action, filmography, set choices and music are so brilliant you cannot help but believe the insanity that plays out before you. You want to believe the fiction because of the quality of the production. The movie also features some surprisingly good performances. Charlize Theron being the real the star of the film, with the titular character really only acting as her support.",/review/rw3237851/?ref_=tt_urv

24 June 2015,tedg,," Some Dusty Pig
","The first Mad Max had a few strong attractions. It was overtly Australian in a few dimensions which hit a niche of the familiar exotic. It was pure science fiction in that it abstracted our world into a future where only the tiniest fragment of what we know was carried over and amplified. That fragment revolved around one of our most peculiar social constructions, the wild motorcycle gang. It is peculiar in being largely a cinematic invention.

","I feel like I am the only person on planet earth who didn't like Fury Road. It is basically a movie about a guy making a U-turn. I'll admit, the visuals are great but I've seen most of George Miller's films and he has an eye, but just because the movie looks pretty doesn't make it a good movie. It needs a real story. This is a 2 hour car chase and it gets boring after 30 minutes because it is literally the same crap over and over again. In a way, the action is wasted on the film because it has nothing but action. I can't be the only person who thinks this! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? This isn't art! Stop pretending to be film snobs for like 5 minutes and just go with what your gut tells you about the film. Just because most of the film critics are calling this a highbrow art house film doesn't mean you have to go against your better judgement and pretend to like this piece of waste. 90% of the critics are paid off.
