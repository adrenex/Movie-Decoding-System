3 October 2011,DonFishies,9," Emotionally devastating, yet equally just as deeply romantic
","I am still trying to play catch up with my reviews from this year's past Toronto International Film Festival, but have found myself at a total loss for words when I try to write out my thoughts on Like Crazy. It was a movie I was excited to see ever since I heard the buzz at Sundance, and one I had high hopes for. Sure enough, I was left reeling after my screening, choking back the desire to weep for Jacob (Anton Yelchin) and Anna (Felicity Jones), a couple so deeply and madly in love who are held back from being together because of immigration laws. It is one of the most emotional experiences I have had at the movies in ages, and one that is not bound to leave me any time soon.",/review/rw2611820/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2011,napierslogs,7," A story of love, depending on what love really is
","Anna (Felicity Jones) and Jacob (Anton Yelchin) are in love with each like crazy. Hence the title, ""Like Crazy"". They are in, or want to be in, a grown-up relationship — one where they act like adults and are just a part of each other's lives. But they met each other at college and one stupid idea forces them to make grown-up decisions that will affect the rest of their lives quicker than they would have liked.",/review/rw2611820/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2011,Rockwell_Cronenberg,5," A lukewarm reaction.
","This is a love story that was quite interesting to me, because the parts that didn't work were the parts dealing with the actual love. Felicity Jones and Anton Yelchin were both excellent on their own, burning with pain while trying to move on with their life and just exist with this hole inside of them. However it was when they were together that the film lost it's appeal for me. I couldn't feel any chemistry between them, so I had no stake in a large majority of it because I didn't understand why they wanted to be together. Even with their first meeting they seemed so dour together, I never once felt any genuine love there.",/review/rw2611820/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2011,WaxBellaAmours,6," Like Promise
","As the movie's title suggest, I truly wanted to fall in crazy love with ""Like Crazy"". By the end, I instead just gave it a pat on the shoulder and became more interested in what the stars and director would be doing after the movie than in the film that just screened. In a movie about the complications that ensue when an American guy named Jacob and a British girl named Anna meet in college, fall in love and then eventually are separated when the latter is denied entry back into the US after overstaying her visa, it's never as compelling as it very well should have been.",/review/rw2611820/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2011,ryanizant-1,9," A Heartfelt and Absorbing Love Story
","Just saw it at the Sundance Film Festival here in Park City, Utah.'Like Crazy' is a love story about the ups and the downs, the euphoria, the heartache, and the sacrifices. For those who don't know the plot, basically a British student, Anna, falls for Jacob, an American student. They fall for each other right away, and spend the summer together. However, she violates the stay of her student visa, and when she tries to return to L.A., she is denied. Thus, our two lovers are separated by distance and multiple levels of bureaucracy that prove to be most unfair. Can they make it work, and should they? Some have compared it to '500 Days of Summer,' and there are a few similarities. The major difference is the lack of any unique narrative devices and that it is, in fact, a love story. First and foremost, let me say that Felicity Jones as Anna is a revelation. She owns the screen and was utterly charming and devastatingly beautiful. There's a scene in the first 10 minutes after they spend their first evening together, and they sit on her bed, and a sense of tension but young awkwardness that fills the room. When the conversation falters out, she gives him a look that was filled with such delicate longing; fueled by the power of young love and the possibilities before them. It was in this moment that Anna, and Felicity, won me over. The chemistry between her and her co-star Anton was realistic and powerful. Much of the film was improvised; the director said he would often leave the camera rolling for twenty to thirty minutes at a time just to capture them together. It shows. I felt myself hoping and wishing for them to work it all out, to end up together.",/review/rw2611820/?ref_=tt_urv

17 July 2016,sharky_55,4," I feel like I'm on vacation.
","The first half an hour or so of Like Crazy is like a romantic comedy on fast forward. Forget establishing characterisation or backstory or context for these two love-struck youths; the story jumps from chapter overview to chapter overview, showing us defining moments and skimming past the boring stuff. She is a foreign exchange student (but just from Britain to America, so not that kind of exotic love story) who leaves him a rambling, heartfelt letter pouring out her emotions, and because it is a movie and they are both attractive they hit it off immediately. But because we have not been given any insight or opportunity to get to know Anna or Jacob, it seems premature to ask us to invest into their passionate love affair, or any other conflict afterwards. When we revisit these moments near the end, they don't have the emotional power they are supposed to have. ",/review/rw2611820/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2011,adams137,9," A freshly brilliant take on young love

23 October 2011,djp2000,9," How far will you go?
","It's so refreshing to see that really good movies can still be made once in a while. The Philadelphia Film Festival began this past week and chose a great movie to open with: Like Crazy. It won the Grand Jury Prize for best film at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival, and deservedly so. It stars Anton Yelchin, one of those names you may not know but whose face you've probably seen before. He plays Jacob. The other star of the film is Felicity Jones, who won't have as recognizable of a face as she has mainly made movies only in England. She plays Anna. Jacob and Anna meet early in the film while attending the same college. There's an immediate attraction and they instantly hit it off. It's not long before we see how madly in love they fall for each other. It's the kind of love that most people only see in movies and never get to experience for themselves. In fact, they seem so in love and happy together at such an early stage of the film that you wonder where the movie is going from there. Well of course nothing's ever as perfect as it seems, and a big hurdle comes along that stands in their way of complete happiness. Anna is not an American citizen after all. She was attending college in the U.S. but still lives in England. So when she overstays her visa, she finds herself banned from the country. Why did she overstay her welcome? She did it to be with Jacob, of course. When someone is truly in love, they will often do anything they can to be with that person; but they sometimes forget about the consequences of those actions. At this point, the two lovebirds must decide on whether to maintain the new long distance relationship. It's not just any long distance relationship of course, it's an overseas relationship. That's a situation which is pretty tough for just about any couple to pull off. So the movie then shifts its tone to one of compromise and struggle. How much can one person sacrifice for the other? Can they somehow lift the ban, or will Jacob have to move to England thus leaving his current job in the U.S.? Is it all even worth it after it's all said and done? Many questions arise, not to mention the possibility of finding new love in their own respectable countries with someone else. It's a great film dealing with human emotions and how far we will go for another person. The two actors pour their hearts out on screen and it can be mesmerizing at times. Like Crazy opens nationwide on October 28. It's an independent film though so it will surely be shown in limited release, but find it if you can.",/review/rw2611820/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2012,StevePulaski,5," The little romances that shouldn't be going on are actually more interesting. That's, like, crazy.
","Like Crazy is a simple and mildly engaging indie love story, but it sort of meanders from interesting and not, tedious and tolerable, and formulaic and fresh. It doesn't offer a great deal of surprise, yet never finds itself as simple or as uninvolved as some Hollywood romantic comedies. Although it remains semi-fresh, it doesn't hesitate to pack in at least some of those Hollywood instances here and there.",/review/rw2611820/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2020,jlwalker19-1,10," Romantic Love Story with Incredible Acting
",This is only the second Felicity Jones movie I have seen. She deserved every award she either won or was nominated for. It doesn't hurt that she is so incredibly beautiful and with such a wonderful British accent. Really both of the leads created realistic chemistry but it was severely disjointed due to the circumstances which drew them apart and back together several times. Incredible acting for sure.,/review/rw2611820/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2011,EUyeshima,6," An Uneven Look at the Loneliness of the Long Distance Relationship
","There is a level of genuine intimacy generated by the two actors, Felicity Jones and Anton Yelchin (Chekhov in the ""Star Trek"" reboot), playing the young lovers in this low-key, low-budget 2011 indie romantic drama directed and co-written by Drake Doremus. Apparently, he and co-scenarist Ben York Jones wrote a fifty-page outline for the movie and allowed the actors to flesh out the story by having them improvise most of their lines. The net result is a level of naturalness achieved in their performances that comes across without contrivance, no small feat given how predictable most love-at-first-sight movies can be. However, there is a nagging conventionality and a relative imbalance to the love story that makes the film fall short of its emotional objective with this viewer.",/review/rw2611820/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2011,fattyfilm,9," Like Beautiful
","This film was beautiful. I saw it at the Sundance Film Festival and fell in love with it Like Crazy. Everything from the acting, to the cinematography, to the story line was amazing. And to think it was shot on the Canon 7D is incredible. I saw 14 films at Sundance and this was my favorite film in the festival. During the Q&A after the film the director made it clear that this film is about the true story of his own relationship with a girl. I would recommend this film to people who have experienced a long distant relationship and to teenage/young adult audiences. This film is the Winner of the U.S. Dramatic Competition Grand Jury Prize at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. I think it deserved this prize. This film made me feel all sorts of different emotions. This film really is a beautiful story and I am excited to see it coming out in theaters.",/review/rw2611820/?ref_=tt_urv

","I just don't see anything that's mentioned in the title in the actual movie. There's no passion between the main characters. They don't act like they're in love with each other. If they're supposed to want, need, love and miss each other like crazy they have a really weird way of showing it. I just don't believe it. Especially since I don't see any on screen chemistry between the main characters. The romantic situations feel awkward, stiff and like they're kissing a cold fish instead of someone they love or are even remotely attracted to. There seem to be much more chemistry with the separate flings. ",/review/rw2611820/?ref_=tt_urv

","Anna (Felicity Jones), a British journalism student in Los Angeles, falls for Jacob (Anton Yelchin), a student of furniture design, and he for her. In fact, so thoroughly do they fall for each other that she overstays her student visa so that she can stay with him through the summer. This causes her problems when she next attempts to re-enter the USA - the Immigration Service don't like people who break the rules.
