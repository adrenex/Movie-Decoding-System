12 November 2018,janiceferrero,7," Amerian Hustle with the benefit of hindsight
","The performances are the safeguard for this movie to have a very long life. I couldn't care less about the characters but I loved the actors playing them. They, the characters, make choices that are as coarse as their wardrobe. Thank God for the people wearing them .Christian Bale is absolute perfection. His character is disgusting and irresistible at the same time. brilliant performance. Amy Adams is superb and Bradley Cooper an unnerving hoot - also the brief moment with Robert de Niro is simply delicious but it is Jennifer Lawrence who made me want to see the movie again as if to confirm what I seem to remember. Yes indeed. She is spectacular. A performance of such maturity - her laughter alone belongs to one of the great ones of yesteryear. - Totally present. A character actress/star.",/review/rw2932740/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2021,margineanvladdaniel,8," Christian Bale, again abracadabra!
","A well deserved movie for all the nominations, not to mention the actors. It had something missing from being undisputed the best of the year, but so far, it is way better than the actual winner of the oscar.",/review/rw2932740/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2013,peibeck,6," Don't be ""Hustled"" by the reviews. ""American Hustle"" is okay and nothing more
","Despite it's stellar cast and great production creds, ""American Hustle"" is little more than a sinners-with-a-heart of gold story. YAWN!!! It plays like a particularly sad Woody Allen movie without the jokes. The film is definitely not a comedy, though Jennifer Lawrence provides not only the best character but most of the few laughs the film has. ",/review/rw2932740/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2013,kunalkhandwala,6," Do not get ensnared in the hype surrounding this hustle....
","In the late 1970s, while America was swinging to rock n roll, exposing all its flashy jewelery over plunging necklines and under unruly hairdos, a scandalous entrapment planned by the FBI threatened several political figures and rocked the nation in its most oddly alluring time. David Russell reunites his cast from his previous best movies including 'The Fighter' and 'Silver linings playbook' to tell us the story of con artists who are led by the FBI to trap bigger fish in an attempt to expose corruption at high levels. This highly fictionalized version of the Abscam sting by the FBI has some meaningful conversations, witty dialogue and glorious nonsense in its overlong narrative. ",/review/rw2932740/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2014,bkoganbing,9," Intoxicating and dangerous
","Watching American Hustle one of the things that truly got to me was how back in the day when J. Edgar Hoover ran the FBI nobody like Bradley Cooper's character could ever have gotten employed in that agency. Let alone have the FBI use someone like Christian Bale as a pawn in a sting. Hoover was such a stickler for straight arrow types that Cooper could never have gotten in the door. Of course Hoover also never went after organized crime, but I can't help thinking that his quirks about dress and deportment weren't completely bad after seeing American Hustle.",/review/rw2932740/?ref_=tt_urv

","First of all David O. Russell is one of my favorite directors. I've enjoyed his films and absolutely loved ""The Fighter"" and ""Flirting with Disaster"". This film also boasts an incredibly talented cast including Christian Vale, Jeremy Renner and Amy Adams.",/review/rw2932740/?ref_=tt_urv

","How in the hell is this one of the most loved films of the year by the critics? The answer is, you just got hustled. You just got hustled if you paid to see this trash that is. The hype, the glitz, and almost no substance whatsoever seems to be the main theme of this film, also confused and senseless characters are another main theme.",/review/rw2932740/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2014,planktonrules,7," Good but over-hyped.
","While ""American Hustle"" has some nice performances, I was very surprised how unexcited I was watching this film. After all, around Oscar time, this was THE film that all the hype seemed to be about and the movie hadn't even debuted yet!! Critics were abuzz and the film got all the major nominations--Best Picture, Best Director, all the acting awards and four other nominations! If I were to create a list of most overrated films of all time, I would include this one simply because of all this hype. No film could be as good as this hype would indicate...and it wasn't.",/review/rw2932740/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2013,beglenrice,4," Bells and Whistles but Nothing to Care About
","There is a very simple way to put this: I didn't believe it. That sums up the movie for me. Yes, there is all the razzle dazzle you can imagine. But there is nothing at the heart of this film. In Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter, for example, I was an instant believer, I bought in immediately, and loved every second of the ensuing ride. Maybe I could tell from the trailers that we were going back to LaLa land territory. Schmooze, slick, and schtick. That's what this movie is. I was literally falling asleep. Because I never cared for a second, because I knew it was fake, the world never invited me in. Perhaps opening the movie with the old 'start halfway through the movie and then go back and show how they got to that point' tactic failed at bringing me believably along. I don't know, and it doesn't matter. The bottom line is I feel like I was never invited into a believable world. I guess it's just not that kind of movie. I had come to have high expectations after Russell's last two outings, which were basically celluloid cocaine. In those two, I was emotionally invested, in the reality, of how believable it was, and then everything else clicked. The snappy dialogue, the electric energy, the rockin' soundtrack, etc., all supported and enhanced the story, because there was a foundation laid. The believability comes from the characters and their relationships, set up by a story, or plot. Apparently Mr. Russell has lost the need for a plot as he is purported to have said when asked by Christian Bale whether the impromptu dialogue would change the story. While having a passion for characters and relationships is great, the story is an equally important element, and one that is lost here. This movie is thematically all over the place. There is little gravitas or gravity that keeps pulling us in its direction. We wander aimlessly through it, like a pimply teenager, awestruck at the glamour, not noticing that nothing is actually happening. This movie is all fluff. My favorite W.H. Auden quote also sums it up: ""What the mass media offers is not popular art but entertainment, which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish."" The same could not be said about The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook. So far 2013 is a bad vintage.",/review/rw2932740/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2020,nathanmanson,9," That was brilliant
",The acting from all round was amazing. I find it very hard to believe that Christian bale didn't win a major award for his role I thought he was the stand out actor in this along side Jennifer Lawrence. It's crazy what Bale puts his body through for roles. The ending was perfect it ended exactly how I wanted it to.,/review/rw2932740/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2013,meeza,10," Hustling at its apex!! No lie!
","What a horrific movie this is! Yuk!!! Get away from this monstrosity of a picture! Kidding! Just conning you because everyday I'm hustling LMFAO!!! I am no pun hustler, well maybe a little, but one thing I know that is real is that ""American Hustle"" is one of the best if not the best movie of 2013. Director David O. Russell strikes gold again with another impressive playbook in orchestrating a motion picture. ""American Hustle"" stars a top-of-his-game Christian Bale as Irving Rosenfeld, a lifelong New York con artist who teams up with the beautiful Sydney Prosser to con desperate men asking for loans. Amy Adams plays Prosser with exact precision. Not to mention, Amy has never looked better in a movie; Will Larry Flynt be calling Amy for a Hustler cover? Who knows? But she is better than that. Anyways, when Irving and Sydney get busted by FBI Agent Richie DiMaso (masterfully played by Bradley Cooper), the con game goes into a governmental level. DiMaso uses Irving and Sydney to seize elected officials in taking bribes; this was all based on the real life Abscam scandal of the late 70's. The movie is set in the 70's and it is presented also as a love letter to that ""won't play by the rules"" decade, and that is the way uh-huh uh-huh I like it. Jennifer Lawrence also is on target here as Irving's showy wife Rosalyn. Jeremy Renner contributed a major Mayor performance as the targeted Mayor Carmine Polito. The entire acting ensemble of ""American Hustle"" was spectacular, but my favorite performance of the movie was of Cooper's as DiMaso. David O. Russell co-wrote the screenplay with Eric Singer, and what a money script it was. Sure Mr. Russell did incorporate a few Scorseseisms in his direction and writing of ""American Hustle"", but he did inject his own Russell muscle to it also. This movie should garner a plethora of Oscar nominations for Acting, Screenplay, and Direction among many other categories; and if it doesn't, there has to be some type of con going on in the Academy. So get on your Con-Air vehicle to witness the cinematic brilliance of ""American Hustle"". In other words, do the hustle!!!! ***** Excellent",/review/rw2932740/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2013,go_titans,9," Excellent, and refreshingly so
","I knew nothing about this film when we sat down in the cinema tonight to see it, so I had no expectations. But from the opening moments I found myself completely engaged by the acting, and interested in the characters straight away.",/review/rw2932740/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2013,RyanCShowers,," The Best Film of 2013
","It did not take an astronomical amount of time during my screening of American Hustle to realize I had found the best film of the 2013. American Hustle was not what I expected, but in the best way possible. Acting as almost a descendant of Goodfellas, it does not rip off the story or characters, but traces of Martin Scorsese's masterpiece can be found in the style and spirit of David O'Russell's now masterpiece. O'Russell keeps his controlled hand over the wild characters and fast-paced plot; for the crime movie it is, class seems high on the list of ""musts.""",/review/rw2932740/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2013,svicious22,3," Self-indulgent mediocrity
","This movie, while containing decent acting performances for the most part, was difficult and just not very enjoyable to watch. It felt as though it was in love with itself and its whole depiction of 70s east coast disco Guido ""culture"" when in fact it was just an empty, pointless piece of bombast not half as clever as it thought it was. It felt fake, contrived and half-baked from the first scene to the last, and as others have noted you just didn't care one bit about anyone on screen.",/review/rw2932740/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2014,A_Different_Drummer,9," Amy Adams steals this movie
","Lets start with the movie itself. David O. Russell who both wrote and directed advances his career nicely with this one. Arguably a tad overlong, arguably the beginning is slow, but by midpoint the audience is hooked on this offbeat ""caper"" film with some of the strongest performances seen in years. Especially enjoyed the scene about a hour in where Bale sits down and eyeballs diNiro -- since for most of the movie Bale has been doing his diNiro impression, and a pretty good one, at that. Liked seeing Anthony Zerbe in a walkon, this man has been acting since before your parents were born and rivals the late Anthony Quinn as one of the longest-working actors in Hollywood. But at the end of the day, when the lights are out, and you are are alone with your thoughts, the performance that really pops is Amy (""Dance with me baby"") Adams. Pushing 40, and no spring chicken, it seems odd to say this is a breakout role for her, but the fact is that she has never used her looks and talent to better purpose. She stands out in each scene she is in like some sort of cinematic ""Where's Walda"" test. And the use of the British accent just makes her character that much more interesting. Russell set out to make a classic and here he just may have succeeded. **ODD FACTOID** As reported in Businessweek (of all places) this was nominated for an Oscar as a ""comedy"" even though everyone, critics and film-maker included, is of the opinion it is actually a drama. BW reported that this was part of the new ""tricky marketing"" in Hollywood where (not making this up), by implying a film which is NOT a comedy really IS a comedy, you increase the potential box office by (theoretically) attracting movie patrons genuinely looking for a comedy***",/review/rw2932740/?ref_=tt_urv

","'American Hustle' is another movie that I've really wanted to see for a long time. It's probably because I love the 70s, or whatever. When it was finally released in good ol' England, it did not disappoint. ",/review/rw2932740/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2013,SSSusin,4," Disappointing
","I went into this movie with the highest of expectations simply because I did these type of gangster, conman, dramatic type of movies.

9 January 2014,bob the moo,," Runs a little long but is stylish, well acted and generally engaging, but you need to leave the awards hyping at the door
","It is that time of year again, the time of year where films are talked up for their awards potential, where good films are hyped as the greatest films ever and so on – so it is a time to be wary of publicity. This is the case to a certain extent with American Hustle because it is a film whose marketing doesn't quite make it clear what it is, but does make it clear that it is probably the most brilliant thing you'll ever see. Of course it doesn't live up to this hype and I can understand why many viewers going in with these words in their brains came out disappointed, which is why it is important to try to leave this in the lobby and see the film for what it is.",/review/rw2932740/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2014,tomgillespie2002,7," A big dose of strangely endearing entertainment
","American Hustle is all about large characters, outlandish fashion and awful hair. It may tease you into thinking it's some kind of smart con- artist movie with it's (very loosely) based-on-real-events premise (""some of this actually happened"", the opening credits inform us) and snappy trailer. But for all visual pizazz, this is in fact a very small movie, focusing on a small set of unique and frequently bizarre characters that just happen to cross paths amidst the ABSCAM operation in the late 70's and early 80's. Imagine if the characters from I Heart Huckabees (2004) were in fact the people who took part in the operation covered in Argo (2012), and you'll have something akin to American Hustle.",/review/rw2932740/?ref_=tt_urv
