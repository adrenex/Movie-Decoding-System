18 February 2016,equitube,7," Well it tries to ""go there""
",I watched this season with both hope and some trepidation. Having been a fan of Degrassi TNG since season 1 I actually had low hopes for the 'remix'. Let's face it;the franchise has been in decline since season 6 or 7. However that didn't keep me from watching from time to time.,/review/rw3424001/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2016,kittykatastraphie,8," I was not disappointed
","I have watched degrassi for a good chunk of my life and I was ecstatic when I found out Netflix was picking this up. I figured with Netflix backing them they would finally ""go there"". There were moments where they went there and moments where they fell flat. ",/review/rw3424001/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2016,Hendu116,9," It's Degrassi
",This newest iteration of the long-running series brings with it a lot of the good (and a bit of the bad) of previous seasons. If you've ever enjoyed Degrassi or other teen dramas you'll likely find a lot to like about Next Class.,/review/rw3424001/?ref_=tt_urv

14 June 2016,donovanrebeca,9," Wanting More
",I've loved this show since I was a little kid. Being 21 years old now I still have a love for it. However I wish things wouldn't happen quite so quickly. I wish they would take more episodes to develop certain issues. I also kind of miss the adults having their own story line as well. Parents with issues who are dealing with real things other than their children being crazy all the time. They just feel like the people who show up when bad things happen rather than the way it use to be with Spike and the adults. I loved having the adult story lines because it made it more real with their interactions with the kids. The care they had for the kids was more in depth than just being their as a comforter. With that said- I really want the show to continue and will support it on Netflix.,/review/rw3424001/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2018,maysy,6," The original degrassi is way better
","I think that the serie is good but not that, I mean there is some good stories in the plot but there is also bad and boring. I think the serie is kinda repeating itself because of all it's season and spin-offs in my opinion the original degrassi and even degrassi the next generation is better than this.",/review/rw3424001/?ref_=tt_urv

29 July 2017,ana57709,2," Like....What?
","This has to be one of the most annoying things I have ever watched. The shows intentions were good, trying to teach young people about different social issues (which is the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one) but I mean COME ON THIS IS JUST CRINGEWORTHY.

17 January 2016,keatonnabors,10," So bad it's funny
","This show, much like the other incarnations of degrassi, is so freaking funny. The acting, script, and overall plot lines are just stupidly hilarious. If you're bored and looking for a good laugh and a show you don't have to completely pay attention to this is perfect. But I also highly recommend it, funnier than a lot of shows without even trying.",/review/rw3424001/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2016,sarifax,2," No Depth
","It lost its soul.I didn't feel any emotions from any of the actors or any of the episodes.They stopped tackling the hardcore issues.I watched it hoping it would get better.The last episode it was going to redeem itself.They lost me.There was no major drama with the shooter.That kid is a good actor they all are.They are better then this show.They need new writers because the old ones have lost their touch.Also the Maya swatting and cyber bullying could of been taken so much further but it wasn't.The dance could of been more intense but it wasn't.The pill popping could of been more intense but it wasn't.They crammed as much as they could in 10 episodes and failed.I'm not even attached to any of the characters.They are stereotypical and over the top.It's so bad I don't even remember the new characters names.Only ones I remember is Tristan, Miles,Maya and Zig.They should try researching real teen drama like Skins first two seasons.Or I don't know talk to teens...",/review/rw3424001/?ref_=tt_urv

",I watched Degrassi when it aired on CTV a couple of times. When it moved to a different network started to loose interest. Although I did enjoy watching Luke Bilyk's character (in recent years).,/review/rw3424001/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2020,POIguy,8," Tries a little too hard to be ""woke""
","I really like most of this show. It leans on the social issues way too hard in many episodes, especially the Frankie being racist storyline. I also disliked so many of the characters. It is pretty clear they all have a liberal slant. Lots of them had really weak stories and were unlikable. The mental health stuff was great. It reminded me of high school just with too much emphasis on social justice.",/review/rw3424001/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2016,kipofilefe,1," Disappointing and Disgusting New Degrassi.
","For over a decade I have watched Degrassi: Next Gen. and it's movies. I have a fond memories of growing up as a preteen and teenage girl waiting for each episode to come out screaming, laughing and crying online with my friends with what each character said or did.

9 October 2017,majabayo,1," Flat, cringy and unrelatable characters, in boring, unrelatable situations
","I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone since it is the stalest thing I have ever had to endure. I have (not out of free will), sat through 2 seasons of this garbage. I remember nothing, and I feel like I have wasted my life. ",/review/rw3424001/?ref_=tt_urv

20 July 2017,Healing_Process,3," Where is the pacing?
","I admit, I found myself watching it because it was a show that required little to no attention to understand whats going on. But I think for majority of people they will not get into this. I can see many teenagers getting into this, but its quite disheartening to see such blatant feminism PSA spread all over the show. The pacing and character development is nothing of any other degrassi show before it. There are only 10 episodes per season and they try to cram as much drama as they possibly can. So what do you get? You get a show with no breathing room. This happen and end all in the course of an episode with the underlying tone of a teenage written progressive liberalism script. The production is quite decent and I do recommend it, if you can muster up the strength to sit through some cringe.",/review/rw3424001/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2016,abond4,3," Cringeworthy soap opera
","I'm a big fan of the first six/seven seasons of Degrassi: TNG (less so from season 8 onwards, but it was still watchable), and its parent series, Degrassi JH/H. The aforementioned series presented real issues teenagers faced while still moving the storyline forward. Yes it felt a little ""issue of the week"", but it was better than the tripe of Degrassi: Next Class, a show related to the others only in name and a few characters.",/review/rw3424001/?ref_=tt_urv

29 February 2016,btrjonaslovergal,6," Degrassi the next class
","I grew up watching Degrassi the next generation , i watched every season, up until most of the older characters graduated than i lost interest for a few years. When i started watching again it was only on one more season , than it was moving to Netflixs... i just recently got Netflix and i watched the the next chapter, i was disappointed that it was only 7 episodes i wanted more. THIS next chapter of the story left on in a way that left me wanting more , i haven't heard anything about a new season . i gave it a 6 out of 10 cause the season was to short and the fact that its only available online . I couldn't connect to this story lines as well as i could in the other chapters, the characters just didn't seem that great there acting was OK . i miss the next generation cast",/review/rw3424001/?ref_=tt_urv
