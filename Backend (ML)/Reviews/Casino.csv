26 June 2005,Tenchi64589,," Finally, a show that portrays teens correctly.
","I've noticed over the years that television seems to have a liking of depicting teens as vulgar, angry, sexually-frustrated idiots... at least this show has the decency to show things as they really are.",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv

16 May 2005,xxblubaby22xx,," I love this show.
","I absolutely love this show. It's so real, and so easy to relate to, it's a great show for teens. The acting is sometimes less than impressive, but the story compensates for it. It's a great show, and I haven't missed one episode yet. Yes, they do deal with frank discussions of rape and school shootings, but this happens sometimes. It's important to be informed in an entertaining way. It also gets your minds off of those other typical shows out there. Like the O.C. for example, is such a typical show. Degrassi gives you what you expect in a realistic way.This is truly a great show, and everyone should get the chance to watch it sometime. I only wish I was around when the original Degrassi's were being made, because I'm sure I would have loved them as well.",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2003,xxlittlekittenxx,," There's no better show for teens
","This may not live up to the level of the original '80s Degrassi series, but I still think this is the best (new) show ever for the set age group (preteens and teens). This NOT a fluffy and unrealistic show like Dawson's Creek or Saved By The Bell; it deals with issues many kids face in real life (discrimination, drugs, rumors, and so forth), and often like in real life, things don't just get back to normal at the end of each episode.",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2004,BMW-rocks,," An amazing show
",This is an amazing teen drama that should be recommended watching for all teens. The characters are 3 dimensional and all sorts of religions and races are showcased.,/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2007,departed07,10," High school at its best.
","I'm an American and let me say that the majority of television shows in America aimed for children and teenagers are full of CRAP!!! Once in a while there would be a comedy show that tried doing a special episode (drugs, racism, school shootings) while making the characters more retarded than the common person. Degrassi: The Next Generation on the other hand, is a show from Canada in which it deals with various teenagers coping with life while in high school. There are too many topics going on in every teenagers life ranging from Internet predators, sex scandals, school shootings, discrimination, murder, drugs, rape, pedophilia, coming out of the closet, framing people, jealously, etc., that there's not enough time to deal with all topics. Degrassi is the type of show that handles every situation very well along with making sure that the characters aren't stereotypes from Saved by The Bell or any Disney Channel show. I don't know why some people complain that this is a show taken itself way too seriously, believe it or not, they are showing what it's like in real life to be a teenager put in dangerous situations.",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2002,j.eaton,," After a 10 year absence, it's nice to see Degrassi again
","After Degrassi High went off the air in 1991, I thought it would be the end of a great Canadian series forever.  But in October 2001 I was so happy to see Degrassi The Next Generation.",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2020,zackboussert,9," Tackling issues
","Degrassi is a wonderful canadian made show based in toronto, ontario. Degrassi tackles many sensetive issues with great care including race and racism, cancer, rape, the death of a parent and school shooters as well as many more.",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2004,abbster_2,," I really like the show...but not the channel that broadcasts it.
","Degrassi: The Next Generation is a really awesome show. It deals with real problems that teens face, such as homosexuality, violence, sex, drugs, and many other topics. My favorite characters are definitely Paige and JT. They add much humor to the show. The one thing I don't like is the fact that in the states, The-N edits the episodes. We didn't even get to see one of the episodes, because The-N thinks that the people of the states are too weak to handle a little maturity. Many of the shows do deal with mature topics, but we can handle them just fine, thank you. Anyway, if you don't watch Degrassi: The Next Generation, then you should start watching it!",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2004,BrideofDracula,," A real life show for real life teens.
","Degrassi: Next generation is not just a show about teens living in the suburbs, going to some high class high school, and living a great teen life.",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2005,anjara13,," Great show that deals with important issues.
","Degrassi is a great show for teens as well as adults. It deals with many important issues including teen pregnancy, homosexuality, losing family members, drug abuse, bullying, puberty, and child abuse. This show teaches many important lessons that everyone needs to know.",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2004,MannyandHarryPotter,," It's so awesome
","When I first saw Degrassi-The next generation, I thought how they all seemed to be really good at acting. The first episode was kind of embarrassing for me, but I fell in love with the show. The rest of the episodes were pretty good comparing to some of the shows out there (O.C, etc...) And this was was real teens",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2004,actionmoviestar,," good show
","Degrassi: The Next Generation was a very good show. I caught this show last night(Tuesday March 30, 2004) on the n-. channel. The channel shows teen oriented shows. Anyway the two episodes I saw were the episodes when Jimmy used ritalin to help him get a better shot on the basketball team and the episode when Ashley found out her dad was gay. This is a good show because this is one of the few teen shows that dealt with serious topics i.e. homosexuality, etc. Until last night, I didn't know that they made a Degrassi: Next Generation show. I also like this show because teenagers acted and are still acting like this when I was in middle school and high school. I can't compare this show to the original ""Degrassi"" but I can sure say this is one of the few teen shows that I've seen in a while that I can say it's actually good. I was never able to catch the original ""Degrassi"" because I think it used to come on showtime and I did not have showtime. I was surprised to find out that this show began airing during my last year in high school(October 2001 to be exact) so most of the people on this show is not that much younger than me. Anyway I hope this show does not get taken off the air and if it has, please put it back on. Since I'm in college now,I definitely won't be able to catch it, except for when I'm on breaks. Good show. Please watch.",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2011,webartist145,5," Degrassi oh my have you changed
","Degrassi has changed so much, Degrassi has gone from a comedy, romance, and thriller. To just a romance. I mean you use to be able to see Holly J and the cheer squad go out for a girls night out, and it started out fun and they have laughs and then the drama starts. Yet at the end there's something that have you on the edge of your seat. I mean even when Jane cheated on Spinner with Declan there was laughter soon around the corner.

23 May 2016,AlexanderExtazy,," A show in decline
","After watching 13th season.. I am quite shocked at the turn this series took from 1st season until today. One thing I was shocked by watching throughout all seasons is the amount of mental illness Canada has... almost all of the characters have some form of mental illness, some in serious forms (Ricky, Craig, Fiona, etc.) .. some are mild. First symptom of mental illness is the belief that the world revolves around you, which seems to me is a belief every character has. Nonetheless I loved the early seasons since I used to watch them when I was in high school in Canada and they really reminded me of the good old times... but later seasons were just written scripts and acted upon by a bunch of young actors/actresses.",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2021,francoischristana,10," Favorite show!
","I grew up watching Degrassi as a young child, it has taught me so many life lessons about sex, drugs, religion, friendship, love, family and high school. I encourage all teenagers to watch this show you will get a better understanding of your hormones and life.",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2010,weirdstrike,5," Should've ended at Season 6.
","When I first watched Degrassi, I was hooked. It was real, and I related easily to the characters. The kids felt realer to me, and was easier to sympathize with. But after Season 6, it all went downhill.",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2020,tect-03564,1," Depressing...
","I enjoyed the first two seasons, but now it's going downhill FAST! Kids make bad decisions all the time and there's no repercussions. Absolutely NO respect for one another. Absolutely NO loyalty... the mindset here is ""everything goes as long as I feel good"". This kind of promotion is dangerous! I certainly hope that this is not reflective of what really goes on in our schools today.",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2013,rexiepie,10," Amazing... Just Amazing
","Degrassi The Next Generation is for sure an amazing show. From the issues it covers, to the best acting, and writing I've ever come across in TV it's no clue why this show and it's other progressers and movies have been so popular and well known. It's so relatable that it has me emotionally attached to characters that have gone through, and are currently dealing with problems I have dealt with myself. Adam being the trans gender one of the bunch had me so attached to him. I've got a cousin who's trans, and even though I'm not trans I know exactly how it feels to not be 'normal' to others around you. I'm bisexual and have been teased, made fun of... Etc.",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2003,life_sux04,," okay, but these kids need acting lessons!
","I wasn't able to see any of the original Degrassi series. But when I got the chance to see this, I have to admit this show is pretty good. It deals with real-life situations that REAL people face- and what I really love about it is that it isn't the type of show where in the end, everything is all tied up in a neat little package. I hate the way shows do that. My only complaint is that some of the acting is horrible- like Spinner and Emma really can't act. Other than that, I like it.",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2001,crackersbonkers,," It is so nice to see everyone back!
","I just watched the first episode of Degrassi: The Next Generation and I am so happy to see nearly the entire cast return. Growing up with Degrassi, like so many, it brought back so many memories. My only concern is that the new series will lack the ""magic"" of the original. The Next Generation seems almost too sophisticated, I miss the low budget-ness that the old one brought. I also worry that this series will be nothing more than a cliche of the original. Regardless, it is wonderful to see everyone back, TV wasn't the same after Degrassi left.",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv

18 September 2002,Shippmeister,," No,no,no
","Why oh why has this ever seen the light of day, I loved the original Degrassi (those crazy Canadians). Why am I so disapointed in this then?, because it has failed to embrace the spirit of the original in any way shape or form, what has been left is a ""pop corn"" version of the original. They could have at least used the original location for christ sake, I watched this and it acted only to re-inforce how good the original was, other than that ""eeeeeeeew this sux""",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2011,pro-sep735,6," Is love all there is?
","Degrassi is one of my favorite televisions shows still airing today. It centers around a bunch of Canadian teenagers attending Degrassi Community School in Ontario, Canada. The age groups of the students seem to be from between 14-18, and it documents the real-life hardships and problems that many kids deal with in the world today (e.g., relationships, eating disorders, drugs, growing up...).",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2003,SwimmerTom16,," Finally, A teen show worth watching.
","I am a teenager and I have seen some measly attempts by shows to showcase ""real teen problems"" but when Degrassi:The Next Generation came along i became hooked. They really deal with issues that are affecting teens these days (Hate Crimes, Teen Sexuality, Drugs, ETC.) They have even begun to tackle the issue of HomoSexuality which other shows wouldn't even touch. This makes Degrassi stand above the rest.",/review/rw0820662/?ref_=tt_urv
