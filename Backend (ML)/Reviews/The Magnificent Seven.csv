7 August 2017,Leofwine_draca,7," One of the only recent Hollywood films to scare me
","LIFE is the latest Hollywood sci-fi horror movie that owes a debt of inspiration to ALIEN. Once again a space crew are exposed to a malignant alien life form, with the twist that this time around the action takes place a lot closer to home - on the International Space Station, orbiting Earth. LIFE tells a familiar story in a familiar way, but I really enjoyed it, and it's one of the few films to actually get my heart going; I experienced genuine fear, for the first time in a long time, in the early sequences in which the alien is trying to escape. I put this down to the sterling job done by director Daniel Espinosa, of EASY MONEY fame.",/review/rw3754911/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2022,joao-vendetta,5," Turns out astronauts aren't that smart
","It starts of interesting and moody, then it's suspenseful but 20 minutes in it turns stupid and stays that way till the end. The characters make one stupid decision after another and that takes you out of the movie. After the third stupid decision/action you lose interest. Good actors, great sets, good SFX, crappy script. It's entertaining, but just barely.",/review/rw3754911/?ref_=tt_urv

2 July 2017,austin0731,6," Solid alien/horror film
","Life was a solid horror/alien movie with a wonderful cast and well shot visuals. It is not a masterpiece especially considering the genre's many great entries, including the alien which seemed to be something that this film has modelled after. ",/review/rw3754911/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2018,paul_haakonsen,7," A sleek thrill in space...
","""Life"" is one of those type of movies that snuck under my radar. I hadn't even heard about it prior to it being released. And I got the chance to watch it by sheer luck. So of course I did so, because I do love watching movies. And with the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds on the cast list, what's not to like?",/review/rw3754911/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2017,tony-clifton,9," People didn't like it because the creature didn't seem realistic
","I've been reading reviews of this movie and it seemed many people didn't like it because they thought this carbon/water based creature was unrealistic. Nothing can survive the vacuum of space, extreme cold and extreme heat, no water and food for years, etc... but there IS an organism that can do that. It's called a ""tardigrade"" - this little creature can survive lethal amounts of radiation, 1 degree above absolute zero temperature, it can turn its body into glass to survive extreme dehydration, it can survive the vacuum of space and the pressure of many hundreds of meters underwater and survive above boiling temperature.",/review/rw3754911/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2017,Prismark10,4," Life from Mars

1 June 2017,emailbox911,7," Not as bad as people make it out to be.
","The internet is a funny place... it seems to be filled with people who have graduated with 5 Ph.Ds. and clearly seem to be smarter than everybody else (thousands of astronauts and astrophysicists on IMDb apparently).

10 November 2019,swordsnare,6," Expect the Expected?
","Not such an original premise of a sci-fi film, but it seems to tick along ok. The cast and production values are quite good. It's a reasonable viewing mind you, but the climax is more inevitable rather than a twist.",/review/rw3754911/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2017,majoreasy,3," So much potential...so little logic...
",Great start and I was riveted for the first 20 or so minutes...then the plot fell over from a lack of logic and slid further and further away from reality.,/review/rw3754911/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2017,ThomasDrufke,9," Goodnight Moon
","If the Alien franchise never existed, 'Life' may be considered a groundbreaking movie in the sci-fi genre, but obviously that's not the case. The good thing is, 'Life' doesn't hide the fact that it's clearly inspired by the original Alien film. Because it's extremely well- acted, paced, shot, and structured, the similarities don't really matter. 'Life' is just a heck of a thrilling time at the movies.",/review/rw3754911/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2019,Tweekums,8," Solid 'monster in space' movie
",Set aboard the International Space Station a team of scientists are preparing to analyse soil samples that a probe has brought back from Mars. A single cell is found in the sample; tiny but enough to prove that there is life of non-terrestrial origin. It gradually begins to grow and appears to react to stimuli. The news is greeted with excitement on Earth and the lifeform is quickly dubbed 'Calvin'. Inevitably it isn't long before things go wrong. After an accident in the lab it gets out of its quarantine container and attacks the crew. They struggle to keep it in the lab but it manages to get out and as it feeds it grows. They have to contemplate the fact that their mission is now to stop it getting to Earth rather than merely saving themselves.,/review/rw3754911/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2019,garethcrook,3," Endless trope-fest
","Revolving weightless camera down spaceship corridor, check. Gratuitous use of lens flares, check. Talking to Earth via video link, check. This thing is packed with sci-fi space film tropes... and that's before the science stuff inevitably goes haywire and the experiment escapes. Cue losing contact with Earth, check. The need for a dangerous space walk, check. Creepy fast growing alien, check. Heroic only one of us can make it, I'll go, no I'll go, check. It really is ridiculous unoriginal twaddle. My TV threatened to go into stand-by mode, with about half a hour to go and I seriously considered letting it. $58 million they spent on this crap, someone should be blasted into space as punishment!",/review/rw3754911/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2017,eparazak,8," Bonechilling, frightening and unexpecting with...empty characters?
","I'm starting to notice a trend in movies throughout the beginning of the year. Ever since January, we've been getting quite a few different horror/thriller films this year. The results have been mixed to generally positive; Split and Get Out have received positive attention for instance. And now we have Life.",/review/rw3754911/?ref_=tt_urv

","Some Haters of this Suspenseful and Well Mounted Sci-Fi-Horror, especially those that Cry ""Foul"" because of its ""Alien"" (1979) Roots might not know that the Ridley Scott Franchised Hit was itself Rooted in a B-Movie, ""It the Terror from Beyond Space"" (1958).

12 June 2017,mukool-hastak,10," Ignore the hate and give it a go!
","I've seen a loooot of bad reviews for this movie, the primary reason for the hate being that the plot was 'unrealistic' or 'implausible'........ uhm.........what the f**k, haters? If you want to watch a sci-fi alien monster movie that's 'realistic', go watch some NASA documentaries, don't come to the cinemas.",/review/rw3754911/?ref_=tt_urv

","What is life? That is a question that so many researchers have tried to answer over the centuries. And what better way to try and answer that question than with a Hollywood movie production starring Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal. My last review this weekend is on the movie called Life, a science fiction/horror film hoping to provide the scares of the March season. But will contact with this film give you the chills, or send you running to the illswith disappointment. Robbie K here with another review. Let's get started!",/review/rw3754911/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2017,six2561,7," I was scared
","55 year old female here (I wish folks would write their age and sex when then review) For at least half the film I was fully engaged in this alien horror film. I was scared, more than once, turning away or covering my eyes. There are intense, scary moments. For a while, it absolutely reminded me of a remake of Alien. But distracting ridiculousness kicked in. I found myself turning to my husband saying Wait, what was that? How is this happening? Where did that come from? I thought it needed oxygen to live...... etc. We walked away saying it was a good movie, but predictable and turned silly towards the end. Not as smart & intelligent as Alien, but not a waste of time. The end is supposed to be a twist, but is almost expected and opens the door for a sequel, which I'm sure they'll do. It won't be any good.",/review/rw3754911/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2017,gradyharp,7," 'I know what I feel is not rational, not scientific.'
",LIFE lacks life. Screen writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick have attempted to offer the audience the feeling of discovering life on another planet but the story is slime and gets lost in the camera work and fascinating (for a while) floating crew and corridors of a space station. Daniel Espinosa directs – or rather manages the action.,/review/rw3754911/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2017,Platypuschow,8," Life: Expectations obliterated
","I'm not a fan of these AAA Hollywood blockbusters, I'm not a fan of sci-fi and I really don't like Jake Gyllenhaal so I was prepared to hate this film! With the usually excellent Ryan Reynolds not being on form, a rather lifeless cast and wall to wall clichés it was looking like my fears were being confirmed.",/review/rw3754911/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2021,robojames,7," Totally Serviceable Time Killer
","I'm seeing a few negative reviews for this one that I don't understand. Life isn't a cinematic masterpiece exactly, but it's thrilling enough to hold your attention for one hundred minutes.",/review/rw3754911/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,TheAnimalMother,8," Thought Provoking In A Very Scary Way
","The critics must be on crack, this is definitely the best violent alien film in a long while. One thing that makes this film stand out among many other similar themed films is the sheer plausibility of it all. Where other sci-fi thrillers like the fairly recent The Martian, or even the original Alien are clearly just over dramatic fantasy type movies, Life seems far more down to earth even in space. Something very similar to this could happen one day you find yourself saying, and that's what makes it extra chilling. Much of the science in this film is very real. In fact we are seeing some of these exact kinds of things this film is concerned with in our very own modern day forests, as the trees, plants, animals and insects continue to change and battle for space/survival.",/review/rw3754911/?ref_=tt_urv

","Had I not seen ""Life"" the same weekend that I also watched ""Alien: Covenant,"" I might have dismissed it as a cheap ""Alien"" rip-off. But because ""Alien: Covenant"" was such a dirty piece of cinematic toilet paper, I ironically ended up liking ""Life"" more than I might otherwise have for coming much closer to giving me the experience of watching an ""Alien"" movie than an actual ""Alien"" movie did.",/review/rw3754911/?ref_=tt_urv
