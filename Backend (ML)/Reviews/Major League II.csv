26 May 2013,StevePulaski,9," The enigma is overpowering me
","I would not want to be the person shopping around a serious script in Hollywood about the life of the famous pianist Liberace. It would be the toughest of sells to a culture that would likely feel the material is too dry and the demand too little. A slightly campier script, with luxurious set design and intimate portrayals of characters the public wouldn't likely know about is what I'd like to get my hands on. The story of Liberace is stranger than fiction and dryer, more serious material could've corrupted its overall goals and ambitions.",/review/rw2871663/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2013,lastliberal-853-253708,8," They have no idea he's gay.
","The big studios passed on this film despite the fact that it is directed by Steven Soderbergh (Ocean's Eleven, Twelve, and Thirteen, Traffic), and would star Matt Damon and Michael Douglas. They thought is would be ""too gay.""",/review/rw2871663/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2013,gradyharp,," Liberace the Legend is served well
",The film is based on the autobiographical novel of the same name by Scott Thorson (with Alex Thorleifson) adapted for the screen by Richard LaGravenese about the tempestuous 6- year relationship between Liberace and his much younger lover Scott Thorson. This film along with SIDE EFFECTS are purported to be Steven Soderbergh's last films he will direct.,/review/rw2871663/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2014,sddavis63,8," Michael Douglas And Matt Damon As You Never Thought You'd See Them
","I can't honestly say that I know very much about Liberace. I was a teenager in the 70's - Liberace really wasn't my cup of tea. Still, I know about him. His flashiness, his sexuality, his ability with the piano - and I'm familiar with the ""palimony"" suit launched against him by his much younger lover, Scott Thorson. ""Behind the Candelabra"" is the movie adaptation of Thorson's book about the relationship, so it needs to be viewed with a grain of salt; it's hardly unbiased. But unbiased or not, it is a fascinating look into the glitzy, showy, and sometimes degenerate world inhabited by Liberace and Thorson, who was almost 50 years younger than Liberace when the relationship began.",/review/rw2871663/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2013,gsygsy,8," A triumph
","This is a first-rate piece of work by Mr Soderbergh and his team (kudos to Ellen Mirojnick's flamboyant costumes and Howard Cummings' outrageous interiors). The otherwise excellent screenplay by Richard LaGravanese loses a little steam around two-thirds of the way through, but recovers to give a genuinely touching conclusion.",/review/rw2871663/?ref_=tt_urv

27 May 2013,Otto_Partz_973,7," Master Class
","By sheer coincidence, just two nights prior to the debut of 'Behind the Candelabra', I had the pleasure of viewing one of my favorite films, 1965's 'The Loved One', in which Liberace played 'Mr.Starker', a casket salesman. So it was with Liberace's voice, image and mannerisms fresh in my mind that I encountered Michael Douglas' portrayal of the man and boy, did he nail it.",/review/rw2871663/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2014,Lechuguilla,8," HBO Is The Hero Here
","Congrats to HBO for having the guts to produce a script which mainstream studios refused to consider. ""Behind The Candelabra"" gives us a story about Liberace's personal life, from the POV of his one time lover, ""blond Adonis"" Scott Thorson. The plot spans some ten years, from 1977 to Liberace's death in 1987.",/review/rw2871663/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2013,ArminCallo-PalmSprings,8," Point and Counter Point: Liberace's Life In Front Of and Behind the Candelabra
","Behind the Candelabra is not a biopic. Although the story revolves around the life of Liberace, the film is more than that. It is a love story that encompasses universal themes with a surrealistic twist. ",/review/rw2871663/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2013,Sergeant_Tibbs,7," Finally a film that suits Soderbergh's voyeuristic and clinical style.
","It's starting to look like 2013 is Soderbergh's year. Side Effects and Behind The Candelabra seem to be my favourite of his career so far, though that's only relatively, as I'm not a big fan of him. I do have Out Of Sight on my to see list coming up soon and I do need to give Traffic another watch before I make any final assessment on him. Although Soderbergh is frequently the director, cinematography and editor on his projects, he may be efficient but he's far too clinical, pushing the audience as an observer that it's difficult to feel emotionally involved in his films. I can't get excited for his half-baked premises that most likely haven't been fulfilled to their potential. However, Behind The Candelabra may be the first film I've seen of his that suits his style ideally. His style is still distant and voyeuristic, but in this bizarre world where Liberace adopts his lover for a son and pays for plastic surgery to make him look like himself, it feels more deliberate to keep us at a distance.",/review/rw2871663/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2013,PlatoSays,7," Damon and Douglas are superbly good

26 May 2013,Jed from Toronto,8," Unexpectedly great performances!
","I decided to watch this film on HBO because I thought it would be a hoot - one of those catastrophic and pretentious productions which are so laughable. Within 20 minutes I realized that the film was rather important. Michael Douglas captures the late Liberace's mannerisms and voice with astonishing ease. He is quite stellar in his performance, and I see him now in a new light. Matt Damon is excellent as Scott, his protégé. The personages involved are deeply complex, even if one is only familiar with the contemporary ""National Enquirer"" reports one realizes their is something one can not quite understand about ""Lee & Scott's"" relationship. Douglas and Damon are brilliant in delving into these characters. They are unrecognizable, at times, from the familiar roles we all know of them. I think the film well worth watching. As a bonus, Matt Damon shows his bum on several occasions, for those who are interested; if not, one cannot help but be interested in the wonderful performances from two of Hollywood's great stars! A courageous undertaking well done indeed!!!",/review/rw2871663/?ref_=tt_urv

14 October 2013,Horst_In_Translation,6," The facade crumbles
","It happens far too often to us Europeans that we have to wait for weeks, often months to see a popular film after it was already released a long time ago in the United States. An especially extreme recent example was ""Albert Nobbs"", which brought Glenn Close another Oscar nomination, it took two years after its first airing in the US after it finally came to Germany. But enough moaning now: Of course we have lots of French, Italian, German etc. films that make up for it because we get to see them earlier and they may not even have a release at in the United States. And then we very rarely have a film like ""Behind the Candelabra"", the big winner during 2013's Primetime Emmys, which wasn't distributed for the big screen in the USA, but was over here in Europe.",/review/rw2871663/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2015,kluismans,4," a disappointment
","a missed opportunity for a film. the true story is that a 57 year old man takes a 17 year old boy to bed, takes him into his home, well his mansion, no less, introduces him to drugs, bullies him into plastic surgery to make him look like himself, and soderbergh decides to give us this piece of fluffy nonsense! its extraordinary. the material is the stuff of horror and this light hearted puff of hum dee hah is the result. is no one else more outraged by the abuse of a 17 year old boy? has the world truly lost its moral compass to such an extent? the idea that a 42 year matt damon should play scott as a 17 year old and fail to tell the real story is wrong. am i really the only person amazed by this? i give this 4 because the film carries a story and it is well acted, it just isn't the film that it should be.",/review/rw2871663/?ref_=tt_urv

","So what if it is a gay movie and was shown on HBO before the theaters? Steven Soderbergh, I salute you for having moxie to show the world what to make films about.

","It's 1977. Scott Thorson (Matt Damon) is a young animal trainer for the movies. He meets producer Bob Black (Scott Bakula) in a gay bar who introduces him to Liberace (Michael Douglas). After treating Liberace's dog, he takes Thorson under his wing. Thorson is entranced by the opulence and an offer of a job. The older Liberace takes over the young Thorson's life including changing his face by Dr. Jack Startz (Rob Lowe).",/review/rw2871663/?ref_=tt_urv

2 June 2014,moonspinner55,4," The sex life of an aging Liberace...why did anyone wish to explore this?
","Atrocious cable-film which garnered critical praise, awards and--most importantly--high ratings upon its debut on HBO. Michael Douglas never begins to suggest piano-playing showman Liberace in this adaptation of Scott Thorson's book, despite the costumes and make-up and wigs. This was something of a comeback for Douglas after a real-life bout with cancer, but there's nothing here for the actor to play (it's all externals). Matt Damon fares a bit better in the role of Thorson, Liberace's sneaky, snarky young lover; however, the surrounding milieu, the show-biz razzle-dazzle and atmospherics fail to come off. A major disappointment from the estimable Steven Soderbergh, who certainly got no assistance from Richard LaGravenese's flimsy, turgid teleplay. Liberace deserved better, big numbers or not.",/review/rw2871663/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2013,cherold,5," Depressing but well done
","This movie about Liberace's relationship with Thorson is wonderfully acted by Douglas and Damon, effectively filmed, well written, and, for me, not especially enjoyable. I found Damon's powerlessness in the relationship depressing, and while Douglas makes Liberace seem pretty likable, his actions are insufferably egocentric and inconsiderate. Since the book this was based on was written by a jilted lover, it may or may not reflect much truth, but it's still a depressing story.",/review/rw2871663/?ref_=tt_urv

10 April 2021,SimonD1900,8," Not a movie that everyone will be able to handle.
","Liberace was way before my time, and even if I've heard the name before, I knew nothing about him, not even that he was a piano player. Definitely not that he was on of the first mega pop stars, before the term pop star was even invented.
