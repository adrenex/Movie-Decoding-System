","Jeremy Irons and Juliette Binoche do some ""Damage"" in this 1992 film also starring Miranda Richardson, Rupert Graves, Ian Bannen and Leslie Caron. Irons is a British cabinet minister who falls for his son's girlfriend (Binoche), a deeply disturbed young woman.",/review/rw1105485/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2004,theodarsey,," A brilliant but misunderstood film
","I'm mainly posting this because I've been reading the other comments here, and I just had to respond.  While a movie's quality is (for the most part) subjective and everyone is entitled to his/her opinion, I must say that those who thoroughly panned this movie have really demonstrated how little imagination most people have, and their lack of appreciation for subtlety in film or any other artistic medium is readily apparent.",/review/rw1105485/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2006,nycritic,10," The Cruelty of Eroticism
","It's been accused of being a cold study in sterile eroticism, a completely passionless love story, and a rip-off of LAST TANGO IN Paris. Whatever it is, Louis Malle's movie DAMAGE is an unforgettable experience that takes the viewer into a story of cloying obsession that spins out of control and literally ""damages"" every player in the movie.",/review/rw1105485/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2019,TheLittleSongbird,8," The dark side of lust and betrayal
","My main reason for seeing 'Damage' was for the cast. Especially love Jeremy Irons, who very seldom has done wrong (in terms of performances that is, he has been in his fair share of misfires but is a bright spot in most of them). But also love a lot of Juliette Binoche's performances ('Three Colours: Blue' being particularly notable, she is astonishing in that) and the same goes for Miranda Richardson in much of her work.",/review/rw1105485/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2004,yossarian100,10," A Louise Malle masterpiece of unbridled passion!
","Fatale (Damage) is one of the most deeply lustful and emotionally charged films I've seen in years, a true Louise Malle masterpiece of unbridled passion. The love scenes are hot, to say the least, and I'll never be able to look at Julliet Binochet again without remembering them. Jeremy Irons does incredible work here and Amanda Richardson, who's part really doesn't require much during most of the movie, actually steals the film with some over the top acting at the end. However, it's Julliet Binochet who anchors this fine movie with her riveting performance and her strong and quite impressive visual presence. I simply couldn't take my eyes off her whenever she was on screen.",/review/rw1105485/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 1999,Shell-31,," If I was on a deserted island with only 1 movie...
","There's a fine line between passion and pain, and no one does either of them better than Jeremy Irons. Obsession is the bottom line here, and anyone who's been there can relate. Nothing else matters, and in this movie, Irons crosses all the lines. His first introduction to Binoche...their first rendezvous...their last ...these are engraved in my memory. Sure rich and beautiful people populate this movie, but the emotional punch it packs is one hundred percent REAL. Miranda Richardson, as the grieving mother, couldn't be better. The haunting photographic image near the end of the movie hit me very hard. A deserted island? And only one movie? Damage. Damage. Damage.",/review/rw1105485/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2004,triple8,8," Much more then you may bargain for.
","I have read some of the reviews on Damage and hope that for someone who hasn't seen it they don't go in expecting some silly little erotic love triangle because this is a lot more then that and, though the story is very well done, it is very difficult to get through. It's NOT light viewing.",/review/rw1105485/?ref_=tt_urv

3 September 2004,paulvdree,," Fascinating
","This movie is really much less shallow than many people criticizing it would think. Actually, I was captivated by it from start to finish. It is understandable that one would question the likeliness of all these events happening, and in that respect the characters might be a bit unreal. But I don't think the movie should be watched that way. The sheer unreasonable passion between Anna and Stephen should be felt, not analyzed. I think that a lot of people wished that they would or could feel something like this for another in today's harsh, business-like world. It is always an easy way out to be cynical about it. Although the characters and their relationships are not very ""deep"", I found everything entirely believable, and that is the only thing that counts.",/review/rw1105485/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2019,imbluzclooby,9," Damage will leave you damaged.
","When a prominent politician embarks on an obsessive love affair with his son's fiancée, one could easily disregard this to the trashy Romance novel from where it came. But Damage is so much more than this, because it meticulously explores this subversive action with honesty and empathy.
Jeremy Irons (Stephen Fleming) has everything a man could want, a great career, money, nice wife, beautiful house and numerous connections with influential people. He's a public figure who seems to have it all. But when he meets Anna (Juliette Binoche), he is awe struck. Anna is a raven-haired beauty with porcelain skin, sharp features and a quiet seductive quality that differs from the usual Hollywood hussy stereotype. The attraction he has for this woman is instantaneous and takes a fierce stronghold onto his pompous, dignified and stuffy nature. A man who is incapable of expressing his feelings due to upbringing, his station in life or whatever, suddenly spirals into this pitiful and lovesick man who can't resist the mysterious and stoic nature of Anna. As they embark on a sexual affair we see that his proper personality is put to the test. As Stephen makes numerous efforts to have sex on the sly with her we witness this prominent man becoming an emotional wreck. Looking gaunt and worried, Stephen finds it hard to sustain his life while maintaining this fling.",/review/rw1105485/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2005,speedo58,10," Real Life
","I found ""Damage"" to be very authentic in its depictions. At the outset, the family seems perfectly normal, insular, self-absorbed, bored by lack of challenge and predictable patterns of action whether socially or sexually. The father is at that dangerous point in middle age, where so many men become disaffected with careers, marriages, children, past interests: The mother,whose true love in life in her son, which while not having reached the point of physical incest, is as obsessive as the father's later actions; the son, who grieves for a closer relationship with his father who knows he is second best in his wife's eyes; the daughter who is probably the sharpest one of all; the daughter's boyfriend with his headphones...all show the detachment so often seen in family relationships.",/review/rw1105485/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2007,JasparLamarCrabb,6," Hell Hath no Fury Like an Insane Woman in Love
","A powerful and married British politician (Jeremy Irons) falls wildly in lust with his son's new girlfriend (Juliette Binoche) in a mostly well made film directed by the great Louis Malle. Malle's direction is very claustrophobic, even more so than his early ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS. Irons, whose film career really hasn't panned out since his Oscar win, is stellar and Binoche outdoes both Sharon Stone and Glenn Close in the femme-fatale department. She's carnal evil in the flesh! As Irons' wife, Miranda Richardson, in one scene of absolute rage, is brilliant. It's a scene and performance reminiscent of Beatrice Straight's dejected wife scene in Sidney Lumet's NETWORK.",/review/rw1105485/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2012,kenjha,1," Dreary
",What a dreary and depressing movie! The script is ridiculously inadequate to begin with and takes a laughable turn towards ludicrous. The romance between Irons and Binoche comes out of nowhere and is not believable for a moment. Their love scenes are obviously meant to be passionate but they are so poorly executed that they come across as rather comical. It is hard to believe that someone like Irons would risk everything for someone as incredibly bland as Binoche is portrayed to be here. Irons does his usual pompous blow-hard routine. The only notable performance is given by Richardson as Irons's suffering wife. This is undoubtedly the worst film of Malle's career.,/review/rw1105485/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2005,mainecoon50,8," I like this movie.
","I like this movie, not so much because of its analysis of but because of the directness with which it portrays obsessive behavior and the price it demands. All the action struck me as very immediate and real, not contrived in any degree. We read about such behavior every day, be it the bank teller who embezzles huge sums to feed a crack habit, or the respectable family man who throws everything away on a gamble.",/review/rw1105485/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2001,zetes,5," Last Lambada in London
","This is a huge misfire by a great director. In fact, I have seen many, many Malle films and have given four of them 10s, two 9s, and an 8. That's a great average now brought down considerably by the 5 I'm giving this film.",/review/rw1105485/?ref_=tt_urv

","What I find interesting about the prior reviewer is that he could only comment upon the sleaziness of the Jeremy Irons characters.  I fully expected to see that in most reviews.  It is also most unbalanced, in the manner of the sex role ideologies of the 90's and the oughts.",/review/rw1105485/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 1999,apocalypse later,," Brilliant Satire
","For this viewer, this was a brilliant satire of the type of self-important love stories that always leave us little people feeling somewhat unworthy. Usually the ""star-crossed"" lovers are celebrated (Doctor Zhivago, The English Patient), but here they are shown to be what they really are - selfish, shallow morons, callously destroying all that surrounds them in the name of their ""special"" love.  Excellent!",/review/rw1105485/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2009,frauna,5," great movie...?
","After all comments I already read here, I am kind of confused. My opinion? Good script, good casting, beautiful people, carefully made movie, but for some reason, not quite convincing. Binoche and Irons became lovers and they are living a completely forbidden passion, a passion so violent and complete that they risk everything around them (specially Irons). But their performances are so rigid, so empty of life and (precisely) passion...!! I've seen people greeting friends at a birthday party with more enthusiasm and sparks in their eyes that Binoche and Irons meeting to have sex in a secret apartment. They both look like they were in drugs, and the boyfriend/son who does not know anything... well, my cat is a better actor when he wants food. One thing is that some people is not running around crying aloud when they are in love, and another thing is acting a love scene like you are thinking of you are out of milk and have to go to the supermarket.",/review/rw1105485/?ref_=tt_urv

","Jeremy Irons wears Saville Row, rides a chauffeured limousine, drinks whisky from cut glass, as a goose wears down. Born to it.

","It came on television and I forced myself to watch it again. Did I mention below how utterly mind-numbingly boring it is? I found myself quickly thinking of how to re-cast it. First, why do they have two women (Richardson and Binoche) who look about the same age? Shouldn't there be SOMETHING that appeals to Irons' character that is DIFFERENT about the fling?",/review/rw1105485/?ref_=tt_urv
