15 November 2017,TheLittleSongbird,7," Stood firm for four seasons, collapsed completely in Season 5
","'House of Cards' much of the time was one of the most compelling shows. Sadly, it has also become one of the most frustrating. Not since 'Once Upon a Time' and 'The Walking Dead', and before that 'Lost' has such a brilliant show of great promise declined so rapidly.",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2020,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,7," Great start for the earlier seasons only to collapse in the final season
","After being denied the position as Secretary of State, a congressman named Frank Underwood and his wife Claire Underwood work for each other in the white house in order for him to be elected as President of the United States. At the same time, he exacts revenge on other people who betrayed him.",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2015,gogoschka-1,," 5 Seasons Of Highly Addictive Political Drama And Darkly Funny Satire
","I love spectacular TV-shows with amazing production values like Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead, but I have to say: although House of Cards has little interest in jaw-dropping images or gruesome make-up effects, it delivers just as many dark thrills to keep you glued to your seat as the action-heavy flagships of HBO and AMC. It's a testament to the writers', directors' and actors' talents that a show which mostly consists of people talking is as much a prime candidate for binge- watching as the shows I've mentioned before, so for those of you who haven't started watching it yet, be warned: House of Cards is highly addictive.",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2018,Bigkingp007,1," What IDIOTS! Legacy destroyed!
",How do you go from 10 to zero in sixty seconds? Kevin Spacey WAS the show. You should have just cancelled if you wouldn't bring him back! So I guess he really wasn't acting after all?,/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2021,Supermanfan-13,8," Worth Watching!
","House of Cards really is as good as everyone says and I now understand why it won so many awards! I just watched this recently with all the free time because of the pandemic and I'm mad at myself for waiting so long. I originally gave it a try years ago but was bored the few episodes and stopped, this time I powered through and became addicted to the show. I have to agree with most others here that the show dropped off a lot after Kevin Spacey left (or was fired). Spacey and Robin Wright were perfect for these roles and were both brilliant!",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Great Political Drama!
","House of Cards is about a ruthless politician (Kevin Spacy) and his wife (Robin Wright) who go to any lengths and do anything to get what they want. It really is as good as everyone says and I now understand why it won so many awards. I just watched this recently with all the free time because of the pandemic and I'm mad at myself for waiting so long. I originally gave it a try years ago but was got bored during the first few episodes so I stopped watching it, this time I powered through and next thing I knew I couldn't stop watching and binged the show pretty quickly. I do have to agree with most others here that the show dropped off a lot after Kevin Spacey left (or was fired and for good reason). It's really not even worth watching once he leaves. Spacey and Robin Wright were perfect for these roles and were both brilliant!",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2021,cncgjqbm,10," Robin Wright Destroyed this Show
","This series was an exceptional political thriller, until Robin Wright destroyed the last season. This series didn't work without Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood. I gave this a 10 for the seasons Frank Underwood was the lead.",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2018,Hitchcoc,2," What a Disappointment
","I've reviewed all the episodes for Season 6 but feel the need to respond to the entire season. There were moments where I felt engaged because of the clashes of evil that took place here. With the exception of the press people, I can't think of a single person I could admire. I know politics is often corrupt, but without Frank's leading us through his various enterprises. Claire is a psychopath, not much different from Doug, and the two of them basically cancel each other out. The sad thing is that I don't care what happens to them. Finally, I wonder how much fun this season would have been if Spacey hadn't screwed up. Claire's posturing throughout is really tiresome. She's sort of Lady Macbeth. She's sort of Cersei from ""Game of Thrones."" But what is missing is a developed plot. I still don't know what she wanted. Was it power or a godhead or what. Or was it just to punish men. This whole thing was a mess.",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2018,m-m-mcadam,2," Terrible terrible ending
","After committing so much time to what was once a great show, I can only say avoid season six. It's ponderous, dull, full of plot lines that go no where and has one of the worst series finales ever made. They should have cancelled it when Spacey was sacked.",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2020,Tweekums,7," Solid political melodrama that loses its way towards the end
","This Netflix series, based on a BBC series, is centred on Frank Underwood; a US Congressman who will do whatever it takes to climb the slippery pole to the top. As the story starts he is whip for the majority party in congress; he is soon moving up in the world, taking his wife Claire, and aide Doug Stamper with him. Those who cross him are likely to see their careers destroyed and those who become a threat are likely to have 'accidents'.",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2018,HHTurkish,8," Disappointing Drivel
","No way around it, Season 6 was awful ...in every respect that the first few seasons excelled this fseason 6 failed.. Preposterous and confusing storylines, awful script, poor directing, the episodes had a soap opera like energy, as the saga provided empty thrills, and culminated in the most bizarre and ridiculous finale I've ever witnessed on television.... The first few seasons were great and deserved the highest of ratings; unfortunately Season 6 was a complete waste of time.",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2019,noskins-23349,1," No Spacey no show
","Don't watch it at all. These propagandas have ruined a great great show.. garbage without Spacey..
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Cheers :)",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2018,hdraytemur,7," There's no reason to watch without Kevin Spacey.
","Claire's character is being portrayed as an important figure from the beginning of the show. But the writers couldn't do it. Claire is the most empty and predictable character in the show. After the fourth season, Kevin Spacey was the only reason I watched it. Now, there's no Kevin Spacey so there's no point in watching it.",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2022,michelle_kummer,8," Kevin Spacey is House if Cards
","It's not the same without Kevin, he is one of the best actors out there and I'm so pleased to see he's got upcoming films coming out. This show is Kevin, unfortunately Robyn can't pull it off without him. A real shame too that the producers didn't back Kevin up.",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2013,me-589-145643,10," Pioneering Perfection
",I firmly believe that one of the major aspects of what makes House of Cards so good is the ability to watch all the episodes back-to-back with no commercials or programming schedules to get in the way. This small but hugely significant idea will be an industry game changer and I am certain that this is just the beginning,/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2018,contactgrod,1," WTF WAS THAT!? Terrible Season 6
",Forgot a rating -I demand my 8 hours back! I want Netflix to formally apologize for torchering me through this. I would have happily preferred to be water boarded than to watch this complete cluster duck. And I don't mean duck.,/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2021,auchterlonieerin,9," No Kevin No Show
","I loved this series, Kevin Spacey made this show awesome. As soon as he was gone the show just went from brilliant to bad. The plot didn't work and the character chemistry was gone. So unfortunate - this could have been one of the most iconic tv series in history.",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2018,larrytate-927-656516,1," Nothing without Spacey
","House of Cards Seasons 1-5 was one of the best series ever produced however season 6 was utterly ridiculous, the decent writers either walked out due to the network punitive action towards Spacey or they wrote nonsense in protest.",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2018,zero_error,10," The series ended with Spacey's departure
","This is one of the best shows; excellent story, good script, exceptional acting by everyone, and good cinematography. The fifth season was a bit slow, but, what's disappointing is Spacey's departure (removal, rather) from the show. No matter how good the others were, Spacey is what made this show perfect. Without him, there is no way the show can survive. The series has ended for me.",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2019,crescendo_1,9," I knew it... Pathetic...
","The moment I heard they are gonna drop Kevin Spacey, I knew season 6 is going to lose its soul & suck hard... But they re-defined sucking in season 6...
Although it started even before that announcement when Claire Underwood broke the 4th wall and stole the intimacy between the audience and Frank Underwood... Yeah that was when all the charm and anticipation went out of the window for the next season...
This sets a new precedence where a stark contrast between season 1 & season 6 shows the greatness and ridiculousness of a good show exhibiting itself...
The ones who made the the decisions to completely ruin the legacy should be ashamed & retire...
I would love to give this show 1/10 because of season 6 but I am keeping my original rating intact for all the goodness of previous seasons...
PATHETIC...",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2018,larcam1,2," A long wait for a LOUSY storyline
","I don't know about anyone else, but I think this season of House of Cards was really lame. The stories were so fragmented and there were so may loose-ends I could not follow anything. Everything was choppy bouncing from character to character. Conversations with no meaning to the overall story. The ending was especially anticlimactic and just plain dumb.
I waited over a year to see some new stuff with Claire as president. It was just painful to see what this show ended up with.
Very disappointed. If there is another season ..... count me out!",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2017,guyzradio,2," My ability to suspend disbelief is shot.
","I've been watching House of Cards on Netflix since S1-E1. Initially, I thought it was a fantastic show. The first 3 seasons became the go-to watch as soon as they were released. Unfortunately, the photographic techniques and music in the opening credits are about all I truly enjoy anymore. Having watched half way into S5 and reviewed the IMDb synopses, it's obvious nothing is ever resolved in the HoC universe.",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2018,bosco-caldeira,," Season 6 is a terrible watch
","I enjoyed every bit of HOC 1-5.. Both the lead actors and the supporting cast were excellent.. Season 6 is Dull as Ditchwater.. A painful watch.. If they did this so that the hundreds of workers on the show wouldn't lose their jobs that's sad.. The show which IMHO was the shining star of the Netflix stable has crashed and burned.. Robin Wright is a great actress but without Kevin Spacey, her acting is insipid and boring to say the least.. For HOC fans, stay with the happy memories of Seasons 1-5.this leaves a bitter aftertaste",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2018,allanwallace-171-669345,5," If not for season 6, it would have been a 9
","I was fairly intrigued to see how it would work without Spacey, but rather unsurprisingly, it simply doesn't. For one reason or another most shows do go downhill a bit as they head into the final seasons, this one has nose dived off a cliff, and we all know the reason why. Whether or not the allegations against him prove true, one thing certainly is, Spacey was the life and soul of the show, it was his portrayal of Frank that kept us gripped, without him it simply doesn't work",/review/rw4442195/?ref_=tt_urv
