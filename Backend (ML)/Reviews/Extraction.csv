13 March 2019,sumtim3s00n,3," Potential wasted by stupid plot mistakes
","I love these kind of heist films so I am willing to forgive quite a lot. But some illogical moves done by supposedly professionals just mess up the whole experience. From not using silencers (and the guy had a whole workshop set up exactly for this reason of preparing arms), to greedly destroying walls and no one covering them. Then all of a sudden the main guy gets super greedy and they completely ignore the time for extraction. Not to mention they keep talking and waiting and messing around. Also why the heck did they lower the windows as they drove past the family car so they can see their faces. Or why not tell the boat guy to meet them a few miles down the coast (after scaling the freakin Andes they couldnt carry the money a few more miles to avoid the teenage army?).
Its just one inconsistency after another that keeps bringing you out of being immersed in the story. I do not understand why they dont give the script to a few military guys for a read through. The ego of whoever wrote this must have been probabily too grand.
Its unfortunate because the foundations of the story were quite solid.",/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2019,Leofwine_draca,8," Generally effective
","TRIPLE FRONTIER is a twist on your usual heist movie, with a much more expansive storyline and exotic setting. The story involves five ex-special forces guys, down on their luck, who reassemble for one final job: to relieve a drug lord of his unnecessary wealth. The drug lord lives in a heavily-defended compound in the middle of the jungle, so lots of planning is involved.",/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2020,shweta-51657,7," Better than the usual Friday night popcorn film
",The reviews and rating are misleading. This isnt your usual Friday evening action film with predictable plot and cheesy dialogues. The casting itself should tell you that. It was a pleasure watching all the 6 leads in the film.,/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2019,kosmasp,7," So much talent ...
","But it seems to be almost wasted. Or as another reviewer put it: Great potential, unused. I would add though ""slightly"" - because it's not that the talent is not being used. There is quite a bit to love here, like the action sentiment, some of the character motivation and some of the general depiction of Army but more importantly politics and corruption.",/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2019,muamba_eats_toast,6," A tale of two halves
",Loved the first half of the film great build and initail heist then it gradually got more and more ridiculous and laboured simultaneously to the point I struggle to keep interest the last half hour. About average overall like so many Netflix films before it...,/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2019,RobTortureWright,4," What A Great Comedy!!!
","The first 30 minutes of this film are fairly dull but we do get to see a car exploding while police shoot up some random bad guys. Next we're introduced to our main character who casually strolls up and fires one of those pesky noob tube grenade launchers into the bad guys building instantly wiping out all intelligent forms of life inside. The cops then shoot the non intelligent survivors for fun and our 'hero' pretends to lose an arrested woman who turns out to be his informant, who he sleeps with, again for fun. Next we see bens character be a terrible Realtor and a terrible father so that's a thing. Next the crew gets thrown together and instantly puts a plan in action and decide to go through with it after looking over a wall and thinking 'We can totally take those guys and steal all their money'. With all that expert planning done they now show up on game day and begin talking over the radio like complete professionals and totally not like a bunch of guys messing around at a bar. They bust in and cant find mr baddie but they quickly figure out through a mindbendingly genius way that theres money in the walls so steal all of that because its cool to do so. The plan goes sideways and they shoot all the awfully trained guards and then find mr baddie hiding, shoot him for the sake of it and torch the place so it looks better. They take the money and place it on a helicopter which they got from some random guy charlie hunnam knows. Pilot of the year now calculates the weight of the cash perfectly and they attempt to fly over the andes mountains. Next we see some of the best CGI I've seen since the deer in The Walking dead or the final scene in Sons of anarchy as the helicopter flies over some mountains. Amazingly mr pilot was off on his weight calculations by a few grams so they need to throw some bags of cash out to make it. Drama alert as they are still overweight like 2 sumos in an elevator so have to ditch the main net of cash which of course falls into a field of cocaine. The helicopter crashes but everyone is absolutely fine and they all jump out and begin shouting at the locals. Ben affleck throws in the towel at this point and poorly reads his lines then shoots a bunch of civilian cocaine farmers because one of them pulls a 2 inch blade out to trim his nails. Charlie hunnam was shot earlier but now strolls about like he's Conor McGregor. Ben affleck pretends he's upset for killing the boys father but is now happy he has a shiny new pen knife. Charlie then strokes a donkey that is carrying roughly 1 million pounds of weight on its back and then they all head off to find carrots because the donkey is hungry. After being unable to locate a carrot they give up and decide to kick their feet up and put on their lovely little raincoats and talk about how they're all big tough guys with so many problems. Now we're really getting into some great filmage as they all edge up a moutain like it's a tomb raider game but because the donkey is so tired from lack of food it slips and falls off the mountain. RIP donkey. You will be missed. The non important humans make it up and ben nearly starts crying because he remembered he's still batman but thankfully he manages to pull himself together. All of the ""band of brothers"" are feeling chilly billy now but quickly begin laughing because they're all celebrities with lots of money so set fire to some of it and laugh some more at poor people. Ben dies.... In the film and then the guy who gets shot in four brothers begins throwing hands at charlie hunnam but mr green street holds his own. They throw the money bags off a cliff, store some in private areas and huff a dummy supposed to be ben down a mountain and onto a boat. They Make it out with pocket change which they give to bens family in some sort of moral pack which no sane human would do. The main character looks at a piece of paper with co-ordinates to the money they threw off the cliff, then walks away. The end. But is it really ? I think we all know what happened next right ? Clearly the donkey survived the fall, finds the bags of cash and hires human slaves to build a mansion made entirely out of carrots. What a terrific film I have witnessed. Truly great comedy, a must watch.",/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2019,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," Lacked the luster the trailer promised
","The story premise and casting were great, but the slow pace and lack of anything really exciting in the screenplay (except for a few scenes), didn't hold my interest where it should've been. The 125 min length was too long, and had the film been edited/cut down to 90 mins with a faster pace, the long dragged out story would have been more interesting and exciting. The directing and cinematography was decent, but I feel the director failed to direct his cast properly to get the much needed emotions from them. Entertaining? I guess. Would I see it again? Nope. Would I recommend it? Probably if you have nothing better to watch. It's a missed opportunity, and a 7/10 from me",/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2019,rcroman2004,8," Entertaining but many Holes and Voids
","Overall it was an entertaining movie. Should have been some more back story on the team. The movie needed another shootout with the real cartel instead of a car chase with incompetent kids. There were no cut scenes to show how the cartel reacted to their boss's murder, or money theft. Or what happened to the lady and her brother if they made it to Australia.",/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2019,rahuljagdish-75872,6," A great start gets dampened by shoddy story telling towards the end.
","The movie begins with good character building, establishing each protagonist's personality and background, and quickly drawing you into the plot. This part of the film is done quite well for the most part and does a good job at keeping you intrigued. Sadly, that doesn't last. A particular scene comes to mind where there's noone keeping cover while loot is being put into bags; and it beggars belief that trained, seasoned ex-military would get that careless even in front of a huge tempting mound of cash. During all of this, an armed antagonist doesn't seem to want to do anything about the banging and shouting going on in his house, but then decides to come out of a panic room only when there's at least Affleck, Hunnam and Isaac right outside its door, obviously looking for him.",/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2019,SnoopyStyle,7," good overall
","Santiago ""Pope"" Garcia is a military adviser working beside the Colombian police taking down the drug cartels. With his beautiful informer Yovanna, he gets intel about the location of a drug lord hide out and his loot estimated at $75M. He recruits other disenfranchised ex-military; Tom 'Redfly' Davis (Ben Affleck), William 'Ironhead' Miller (Charlie Hunnam), Ben Miller (Garrett Hedlund), and pilot Francisco 'Catfish' Morales (Pedro Pascal).

7 April 2019,Her-Excellency,4," I keep asking myself: 'WHY didn't you like it?""
","From what I understand after watching most of it, then much later Googling to find out what happens, this is a project that was in the making for almost a decade, with no takers. In that time of being rejected, it should have been revamped and made better before Netflix got its hands on it. As it is, the fact that it was made, brings us forward to me sitting here scratching my head, asking myself the Title question of WHY I DIDN'T LIKE IT.",/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2019,chet19,5," Screenwriting 101 errors
","This two-hour movie is more like 4 separate half-hour episodes of a tv show. Movies that are like separate episodes instead of one steady plot throughout are a no-no, and this Triple Frontier (what does that title mean, anyway?) is like that. Episode one is Poe Dameron as a US soldier helping a foreign police force. This first 20 minutes had nothing to do with rest of script. Episode 2 was Poe trying to convince Ben Affleck to come out of retirement for one more heist. Such originality...a special ops guy being offered the proverbial one more mission. Never any drama, because we all knew Ben would say yes, so we wasted 15 minutes of him saying no before coming around. Seriously, did the director think the audience was surprised when Ben finally said yes?
Episode 3 was the heist itself, which some school kids coulda pulled off. The house is pretty much empty, except for 2 terribly trained guards against 5 elite US army rangers. Guess who wins.
No tension at all during the heist. We needed some truck coming up the driveway or some secret guards closing in on them, but nothing. 15 full minutes of men stuffing gym bags with cash. Meanwhile, these most elite and disciplined soldiers suddenly lose all discipline. They lose track of time, get greedy, and sloppy. out of character.
Episode 4. Next, the very safe and disciplined helo pilot knows the cargo is too heavy, but takes off anyway. Huh?
900 zillion acres of mountain and jungle, but the cargo ""just happens"" to land in a cocaine village.
Finale: the final obstacle to get home is an army of mercenaries at the port. Now the soldiers have a conscience and don't want to kill the drug lord's army. They might be young, so we can't fight them.
Guess what? They fight and kill them anyway, so the ""we can't fight them"" debate was just a waste of my time.
And the biggest laugh of all is the men simply giving up all they money.",/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2019,akcenat,6," An action/heist thriller that turns into a plodding parable of greed
","Five ex-military veterans reunite to rip off a drug lord, but like every other robbery in movie history, it does not go as planned. Despite a sturdy premise, ""Triple Frontier"" is curiously inert, shallow and un-involving. Despite a strong cast (Affleck, Isaac, Hunnam, Pascal and Hedlund) it feels like the characters are flimsy and inconsistent. The most tension filled scene is the robbery itself, which surprisingly happens early on into the run time. The length of the film is also a bit challenging at times and seems to drag on. As a result, it is a film that is competently made so you are not really seeing a bad film 'per se', but then it is also an uninspired film, so you won't see anything that goes above mediocre for most of its run time. It felt like there was a lot of potential here, but somewhere along the way it got lost and we ended up with its shadow instead.",/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2019,johnnyreevesbass,9," I really enjoyed it
",Netflix has some hits and misses. With Triple Frontier I was very impressed with the film. The story and plot feels very used as it is not an original idea but the writers take on it keeping the story moving I felt was great. The cast did great and showed real emotion as I did see some BTS were the cast were trained to use the firearms as real mercenaries. That gave me so much more production value and makes me give it a higher rating. As a Netflix film if you already got the membership it will not hurt to give it a watch.,/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2021,Abdulxoxo,7," It's quite entertaining
","This movie has a solid cast and it's thrilling and entertaining. The story and characters are simple and easy to follow. The film gives you just enough information and background about the main characters and puts them in enough believable peril. The movie's pretty predictable and by the last third of the movie the pacing slows down quite a bit. I enjoyed the moments the film presents though when the men are escaping. You see them slowly start to kinda become different people because the money is changing them.
The action is well staged and intense, the cinematography is beautiful and the camera work captures the fights and sceneries very well. The acting is amazing as every individual actor played their part well. Overall, an enjoyable and entertaining action flick, not bad for an original Netflix movie.",/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2019,jonas-wachner,5," Great start, then becomes unrealistic
","Great start, good acting, good music location etc. But then they all become super greedy, nobody covers when they get the money from the walls, they fly with way too much weight, etc.
I always think a movie is really bad when you think the whole time ""what the f, that's just dumb"". This is one of those movies.",/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2019,ricochet93-369-308802,5," Where Do The Crazy High Ratings Come From

25 May 2019,MOscarbradley,7," A good action picture, nothing more.
","A disappointment but only slightly. ""Triple Frontier"" is directed by J.C. Chandor who co-wrote the screenplay with Mark Boal and Kathryn Bigelow is one of the Executive Producers. It's an action picture, a Colombian drugs movie and a heist movie. There are fine set=pieces and it looks terrific; the mostly Colombian locations are beautifully photographed. The problem is for a Chandor/Boal picture there isn't much depth.",/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2019,unnamed-32145,3," Should not have a 7 rating
","Was fun to watch for the first 30 minutes, mildly enterntaining for the next 30. After one hour it went down the hill, either totally predictable or totally unrealistic (meaning not even the old way of ""action unrealistic"", just dumb). The story writers obviously did not care much whether it made sense anymore.",/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2019,abuashraf73,6," A great start which too quickly went downhill
","The movie started very nicely, built the plot, the suspense, the characters, however very soon with some lame turns the main interest went South. The cast is great. All of them are renowned, top notch actors. This might be a very good movie but unfortunately I m sure it lost the audiences attention right after the heist was made. I mean you don't expect those amaetur movies from a special op soldiers..",/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2019,srwenk,3," Meh.
","Honestly I can barely watch it, fighting the urge to turn it off since it's so close to being over.
I have so many problems with it, I don't have enough time to list them. Lol
I will just sum it up, 5 'best of the best' military men would not have made those 20+ cascading cluster fudge of bad decisions.
It was just not good.",/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2019,amirmustafaa,7," Not What I Expected
","Going into Triple Frontier, I thought it was going to be another generic heist movie, but to my surprise, this is one of the best heist movies that I've seen in a while. What sets this movie apart is that it's not about the heist but the aftermath. Instead of the heist being in the 3rd act, it actually takes place earlier in the movie and the rest of the movie are the characters dealing with what comes after.",/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2019,filmklassik,5," SHOULD'VE STOLEN BETTER DIALOGUE!
","No kidding. The dialogue in this one is ATROCIOUS. It features actors playing tough, ex-army rangers spouting lines that do not feel true to their characters. Most of the time, their dialogue is utterly devoid of subtext. Each character says PRECISELY what is on his mind, whereas in real life - where deep-seated emotion is concerned - we generally IMPLY our feelings indirectly.",/review/rw4729447/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2019,screenotes,6," Morally confused
","Focusing on an ""illegal"" mission to steal a drug lord's fortune, Triple Frontier (2019) initially appears to be more than just your typical heist movie.
