30 January 2009,wliia,9," A very sweet and funny film
","I admit, I am a fan of Tinker Bell (something a 22 year old MALE wouldn't approve of, like me), and I've always wanted to see this enchanting but short film. It's magical in every way.",/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2008,StartingAllOver14,," Sweet and charming CGI Disney movie
","I saw this movie last Saturday when they showed it randomly on Disney Channel (in Norway) and I was pleasantly surprised. I've seen some trailers and clips from this movie and the animation looked quite good, so although my expectations weren't the highest, I still hoped that ""Tinker Bell were going to be a watchable picture - which it turned out to be.",/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2008,brettster,8," Sweet Family Film, Better Than Many Theatrically Released Disney Films
","Saw this movie today (9/26/08) with my young nieces at a special El Capitan Theatre preview in Los Angeles. We were all delighted by Tink's excellent backstory, the ingenious story and the handsomely rendered 3-D animation. Cast is uniformly excellent, including Lucy Liu, Kristen Chenoweth and Anjelica Houston. This was much better than some of the theatrically released Disney animated films I've seen (notably ""Atlantis""), making it among the best of the Mouse's direct-to-video titles. Well worth checking out with your kids, but don't be surprised if you find a tear in your own eye at the conclusion of this delightful surprise.",/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2011,TheLittleSongbird,8," Cute, undemanding fun
","At first, I was not expecting much from Tinkerbell, but it was much better than I expected. While too short with some moments of insipid dialogue, Tinkerbell is a cute and entertaining movie that never tries to be anything more than it is.",/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2020,Animany94,7," Enjoyable.
","I never thought I would enjoy a movie centered around Peter Pan's anger-prone fairy compagnon, but she was surprisingly likable in this prequel spin-off thingy.",/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2008,Vastarien202,8," Beautiful!
","This was a wonderful movie! I think it was as good as anything Disney has done in last 15 years. What really set this apart from most of the DVD fare is the incredible score, with music from Loreena McKennit! I could really relate to Tink's desire to find who she is and why. I looked everywhere for MY Talent, and it's taken a long time for me to really be happy with myself just the way I am. That's one of the most important and easily forgotten things you can learn in your life, and I'm glad to see that in any movie. The only thing I would have changed was the addition of so much Pop in the soundtrack. I much prefer the orchestral and Choir work to the latest Tween princess crap. Give this a chance, at least a rental. Just enjoy it for what it is, and believe again.",/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2008,altodorable-kelbel,10," loved it
","i am obsessed with Tinkerbell too, just like other people who wrote comments. also i have read peter pan and researched into James Barrie's life for hours on end, but I still loved this movie. it was adorable and cute and even though they changed the feisty Tinkerbell that was, it was placed before peter pan. no, she can't talk in peter pan but it's probably because she is so small maybe human's couldn't hear her but since peter pan was magical he could hear her so they just didn't make her lines. no, it's not exactly what Barrie wrote but i still think he would be pleased with the movie. it was very creative and i loved it!",/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv

","My 3 year old daughter absolutely adores this movie. In fact, she likes it better than many of the more highly touted Disney theatrical releases.",/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2017,ericstevenson,7," Better than the Disney sequels at least
","I guess I didn't like this as much as most people, but it's still a good movie. This is notable in marking the end of the direct to video Disney sequels everyone was complaining about to make room for the Tinker Bell movies. I think they were actually made by the same studio, but these do seem to be a step up from them. This movie actually tells us about Tinker Bell's name. I never thought of her as an actual tinkerer. In this movie, she tries her hand at various other things besides tinkering. There's some pretty creative ideas here.",/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2012,Smells_Like_Cheese,5," Tinker Bell must have gone to a lot of anger management classes to get this tame
","One of my favorite childhood films is Peter Pan, the Walt Disney version. Say what you want about it, it may be flawed, but I still love watching it today. It also introduced us to one of Disney's ultimate bad girls, Tinker Bell. She was sexy, she was bad and she didn't hide it whatsoever. Modeled after Marilyn Monroe, she's one of Disney's true little beauties who fought for her true love and despite everything that she did to hide it, she really does have a good heart. I think that's what makes her so appealing to a lot of girls, we could relate to her. How many of us are ""friends"" with a guy that we are in love with, but he doesn't notice back and falls for another girl? Same with guys, we've all been in that situation. So Tink really is really true to the song ""Stand By Your Man"". Well, Disney saw her popularity and naturally made a spin off making her the star. I wasn't sure how it would work but decided to give it a shot.",/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2009,gtequila369,10," Really Enjoyable
",When I saw this with my little sister I didn't expect to enjoy it so much. The animation was great and the scenery was beautiful. The characters were lovable and plot was interesting. It contained themes that I think people of all ages and genders can relate to. It was touching and sweet at the same time. I really loved it. They did a good job of expanding on the character of tinker bell. They were successful in making her an extremely multi-faceted character. Her search to find herself and her flaws make her an interesting heroine. I thought that the movie gave off a positive message that we can all learn from about accepting who you are. I didn't want the movie to end. I cant wait to watch the next Tinker Bell movie.,/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2009,sddavis63,5," A Nice Idea That Became a So-So Movie
","As is always the case with Disney movies, the animation in ""Tinker Bell"" is absolutely top notch - drawn with an obviously delicate touch, realistic and very, very beautiful. I also have to also give credit to whoever thought up the idea of making the movie. Tinker Bell is a Disney character everyone knows, but about whom we know virtually nothing, so the idea of filling in the little fairy's past was a good one, as was the thought of giving us a glimpse of how fairy life is organized. Personally, though, I thought the story was a bit too advanced for little ones. I also didn't think that - aside from Tinker Bell herself - any of the characters in this movie were particularly memorable, and I was extremely disappointed with the music. Disney can usually be counted on for finding memorable songs to go along with their movies, but the music here was, again, not something that I thought young kids would relate well too, and certainly I won't be singing any of the Gaelic-inspired tunes that were used here. Essentially, it was a nice idea that could probably have been better presented. 5/10",/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2018,paulclaassen,5," Not bad and nothing special either.
","Hmm, there's nothing really special here for me. It wasn't amazing and it wasn't bad. The film has a very simple, uncomplicated plot. Its about a fairy wanting more from life, believing she's not bound to doing tinkering her whole life. In a way I could relate to Tinker Bell.",/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv

3 July 2014,amour88,7," Great Direct To DVD
","Tinker Bell is a surprising good direct to DVD. It tells the story of Tinker Bell's origins. It has plenty of charm and is pretty funny too. this movie shows you should be proud of your talents and not to try and be something you're not.At first Tink does not want to be a ""tinker"" but she comes to realize that she was born to be a ""tinker"". Her friends are supportive and always encourage her. Tink is a great character,she is hard working and loyal. She is a great role model to girls. She loves and is great at building things which you don't see too much in kids movies. Unlike most Disney movies she does not need a boy to rescue her.",/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv

27 April 2011,jboothmillard,5," Tinker Bell
","I had seen the original 1953 Disney animated film Peter Pan, and its sequel made nearly fifty years later, and I guess a film focusing on the famous pixie fairy sounded relatively interesting, so I watched it. Basically, the story is set in the world of fairies, who create the four seasons of the year and all components of them, such as the colour of leaves, snow, and much more. Born into this world as a fairy herself is Tinker Bell (Independence Day's Mae Whitman), who before settling in has to find her skill and talent, like all the fairies have, and she is selected by her tool as a ""tinker"". The tinker fairies are responsible for fixing things for all the four seasons such as the contraptions that help make things and stuff, specifically for Spring, but this job isn't as important as the other fairies talents. Tinker Bell is fascinated hearing about the Main Land, i.e. the human world, but she is disheartened to find out that as a tinker she cannot go to the Main Land. She knows the only way to be able to go is to have a talent that would be useful in the human world, so she tries her hand at using new skills in the four season lands, with no success. Her friends Rosetta (RV: Runaway Vacation's Kristin Chenoweth), Silvermist (Lucy Liu), Fawn (Ugly Betty's America Ferrera) and Iridessa (Raven-Symoné) are supportive, but Vidia (Pamela Adlon) is mean and keen to see her fail, and makes her mess up big time. Overseer Fairy Mary (Jane Horrocks), and of course Queen Clarion (Anjelica Huston) are devastated to see all the preparations for Spring have been ruined by the disastrous events caused by Tinker Bell, but she redeems herself by helping to fix everything. In the end, Vidia gets what she deserves for being mean, and Tinker Bell proves herself the hero by saving the Spring season ready for the Main Land, and as reward she is allowed to see it, and return a toy spinning ballerina back to its owner, a little girl named Wendy (of course). Also starring Jesse McCartney as Terence, Jeff Bennett as Clank, Rob Paulsen as Bobble and Loreena McKennitt as Narrator. The voice casting is not bad, the Scottish fairy with glasses and the fat one are obvious comic relief, the computer animation is relatively good for straight to video, and it is an okay story, so all in all, not a bad family animated adventure. Worth watching!",/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2011,neil-476,7," Good for the tiddlers
","This CGI feature from Disney tells the origin of Tinker Bell. The fact that the Tinker Bell shown here is nothing like Barrie's is neither here nor there - neither was the Tinker Bell in the original animated feature. Likewise the fact that the visual look is very clean and simple, without the multiple rendering passes for adding levels of texture - this doesn't matter.",/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv

17 July 2010,berynn,8," Good cute movie when you see it separately from Peter Pan...
","For me that cartoon is good, but Tinker Bell here is not the Tinker Bell from Peter Pan... It might be the same person but she's not the same person, not same character... Just not the same... But still good and cute. Not really any bad character in the movie, that is relaxing and very different of most where there are villains... The worst ""villain"" here is another fairy, jealous for actually no reason, just like kids fight, not real ones... But just forget about Peter Pan and all that, it's not the same... If you think it's Peter Pan fairy, you'll hate that movie... If you see it differently well you might like it :)",/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2011,flyingamon,9," I really like Tinker Bell now
","I was never a fan of Peter Pan and I certainly didn't like Tinker Bell in that movie. However I do like fairies and was curious to see what they would do with a movie of Tinker Bell living her life in Pixie Hollow with the other fairies. At first I thought the digital graphics would bother me as I was used to the more classic Tinker Bell animation. This not only improved the whole magical atmosphere surrounding these fairy woods, it made it also into a highly entertaining movie. Right from the start you are drawn into an interesting story with a morale. Next to Tinker Bell's story we learn about the different kind of fairies, their abilities and duties, which came in really handy for me a storywriter. I was also glad to hear that this movie will have sequels which will probably end at the moment she meets up with Peter Pan. I liked Tinker Bell without Peter and the lost boys. This is now one of my favorite Disney movies. It's maybe not perfect as I would have hoped to get to know the other fairies better too, but I guess the sequels will work on that. Still a big 9!",/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wow Mae Whitman also voiced Amity Blight ( The Owl House), Kristin Chenoweth voiced Gabby ( Río 2) and Maleficent ( Descendants). Even though I like The Owl House, Río 2 and Descendants, i think this movie ruined the Peter Pan franchise i would prefer to watch Bolt and Wall.e better than this movie.",/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2019,silvermistvio,9," It's a total fun.
","When I watched Peter Pan animation, I always wondered the life of Tinkerbell. How Tinkerbell became and how she lived? And et cetera, et cetera. Finally, they made an animation for what I wanted to know. I was so happy to watch it.",/review/rw4869465/?ref_=tt_urv
