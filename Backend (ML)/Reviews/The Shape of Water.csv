17 August 2022,Draysan-Jennings,7," FUN FILM
","It's hard to believe this is based on a true story. Apparently this really happened to director/star of film. I'm not exactly sure how much of it is true, but it's still a crazy story either way. I recommend checking it out. 7 stars.",/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2022,ferguson-6,7," dad goes catfishing
","SXSW 2022
Greetings again from the darkness. It's difficult to know whether the biggest story here is that this is one of the cringiest movies you'll see or the fact that writer-director-star James Morosini based it on the actual relationship and events with his own father. Morosini opens the film with this: ""The following actually happened. My dad asked me to tell you it didn't."" That sounds kinda funny and sets the stage for some father-son conflict. But it certainly doesn't prepare us for what we are about to watch.",/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2022,FeastMode,6," Fun premise, pretty funny
","I Love My Dad is an enjoyable movie. The fun premise is used in creative ways. I laughed a good amount, although there were a few very unfunny parts. I like the story and there are some solid performances. I had a good time with this one-time-viewing type of movie. (1 viewing, 8/10/2022)",/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,sngreolbrtd1983,8," We have to be honest here....
","People these days are zone focused on superhero films. That all fine and well but when your aren't on that wave and you want something different and new this film gives you that. It's funny, sad, maddening and heartfelt. James Morosini I applaud you for putting yourself out there.",/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2022,skpn123,10," So much talent, creativity and heart here
",10 minutes into this film I was so creeped out by the father's behaviour I was going to stop and rate it 2 Stars as I thought it was another creepy Lifetime film but then I glanced at a write up and found out it was the true story of James Morosini's life and relationship with his Dad and I kept going.,/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,Rob-O-Cop,8," the perfect uncomfortable tone.
",Congratulations to the director and writer of this film for steering his movie down the delicate path to land this story.,/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,lgordonsswc,1," Sick, Dysfunctional Father
","Seriously, there is nothing to redeem this movie. It is not healthy to forgive parents or partners who operate on this level of toxicity. I actually think this film borders on dangerous on its portrayal of this father/son relationship as well as the father's relationship with his own girlfriend. The amount damage this father inflicts on his son and others before he ""learns his lesson"" is way over the top. His choices could have literally caused his son's death more than once but he keeps going on and on in his deceptions, hurting everyone in his path. Yet we're supposed to believe he's worth it.",/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,trinaboice,6," You have to sit through a lot of ""ick"" to get to the ""awww""
","IN A NUTSHELL:
The movie was directed and written by James Morosini. Kudos to him! As it turns out, this movie is actually based on his personal life experiences with his absentee father. Making this movie had to have been therapeutic for him and his dad.",/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,Cinnamental,7," Cringe comedy with good acting performances and story
","I had a fun time watching this one. Writer/director/star Morosini did a great job here. I never felt bored during the movie. Every scene was cut the right way to keep the movie running along without dragging. There are some emotional moments with the dad and his son with the issues the son has. It never really explains why the dad was such an absentee father, especially with a son who is suicidal. You've just gotta go with the idea that he was a terrible dad and just wanted to get back into his son's life somehow. I'd watch it again.",/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2022,danieljfarthing,9," Written with fresh originality this true-tale little dramedy is superb - both touching AND laugh out loud funny
","Props to second-time writer / director James Morosini for superb little true-tale dramedy ""I Love My Dad"". When dead-beat excuse-maker Patton Oswalt (excellent as ever) gets blocked from all contact by his troubled teen son (Morosini himself - terrific) he cat-fishes the lad with a fake profile based on local waitress Claudia Sulewski (also great). From there the plot thickens (dragging in Oswalt's circle like Lil Rey Howery & Rachel Dratch (very funny)), sometimes hilariously, but ultimately touchingly... even tragically? It's an engaging tale but what sets it apart is Morisini's fresh, original approach to it's writing. Although it's not flawless, it's certainly very good.",/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2022,onexmillion,8," Fancy Something Different?
","Yes, it's super cringe, it has moments of hilarity and moments of sad, but it's all from a good place.",/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,mrkellyparks,1," The son might have forgiven him but I do not.
","The father in this story is irredeemable. He should have had a heart attack and died. Sure there are funny moments but they are all out shadowed by the fact that there is nothing to love about the father character. He is a horrible excuse for a human being and if anything like the person that inspired the character, that person should be prosecuted, convicted, and rot in prison. You'll spend the entire time wondering why you are still watching this human garbage. Everything about the technical aspects of the film was good. The character is just a horrible person.",/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2022,swimdconswim,10," Best movie I've seen in a decade
","I'm surprised to say this about a comedy, but this was The best movie I've seen in a decade. It's so much more than a comedy. Down to every little detail, it was brilliantly done. Cannot believe this story is true and it makes it that much better!",/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,euroGary,8," 'Incest' is best?
","For the first couple of decades of his life, Franklin has been consistently let down by his father, Chuck: birthdays, graduation... every important event has begun with a paternal promise to be present that has ultimately been broken. Eventually, the frustrated young man blocks his father from his social media accounts. In an effort to keep in contact, Chuck creates a fake social media identity, going so far as to steal photographs from the account of Becca, a kindly, attractive waitress. But events spiral out of control, with Chuck getting trapped in an on-line affair with his own son. What will happen when Franklin decides he wants to meet the supposed woman of his dreams?",/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2022,banananatime,," Not really a comedy...
","It might have started out as a comedy, and the trailer makes it seem as such, but in my opinion it's pretty dark. Isn't dark comedy a movie genre?",/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,chris-politz,10," Uncomfortably funny throughout lol
","Is your favorite episode of the office (us) the dinner party episode where Michael and Jan bicker at each other? Do you slow down your car at not fatal car accidents, chuckle and say dumb ass? Do you say things that purposely lack social refinement, then smile waiting for company to overt their eyes?",/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2022,arthur_tafero,5," Passable Father and Son Film - I Love My Dad
","Even though there are a dozen reasons to give this film less than five stars, I am a sucker for father and son movies. This one is about average for that genre, which has been done a few hundred times in Hollywood history. Some are extravagant productions, such as Superman, which has some great father and son moments; others are independent films, which generally give us more well-rounded motivations and characters. This film falls somewhere in the middle of those variables; consequently, the five-star rating. The father is the more interesting of the two protagonists, and Oswalt does a competent job here.",/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2022,mannai-08977,8," Great movie!
","I have read the premise of this movie before going and watching it and was quiet excited as I didn't recall watching catfish Based movie ever before and thought the idea of it would be rather fun . And after watching it I can say it livid to what it promised , the pacing was well made the acting was also good especially the father moreover the direction their were going with plot was well thought and movie ended in decent clever ending although it was low budget film . I can say confidently I enjoyed it.",/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2022,jisforjoe,5," Imperfect but A for Effort
","What do you say to a movie that's a dud overall, but you don't want to discourage the creator from refining his craft? There were solid pieces here, and I'd like to see More-osini (ü•Å) from James in the future.",/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,thejefflewis-92228,5," Trailer is deceptive
","My family spent a good amount of time trying to find a movie to watch. After watching the trailer to ""I Love My Dad"", we thought this was going to be a fun, and hilarious movie. Well, unfortunately, all the best jokes are in the trailer. And since you already seen these jokes, there is nothing left to laugh at. ""I Love My Dad"" is closer to a drama than a comedy. It is a drama that is hard to relate to because the situation is bizarre. The texting conversations show how the son visualizes the girl, which makes the movie more watchable than if it just took place over texting. As a drama, I don't think the movie works.",/review/rw8500174/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2022,etann-36707,1," A premise like this is just a sign of how degenerate a society has become.
