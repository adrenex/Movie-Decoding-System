5 December 2020,SC10070805,8," A deeper dive into Selena's story.
","As a fan of Selena as well as a fan of the original movie, I like the series overall. While I agree with some of the other reviews that the actress portraying Selena is not the greatest, I love the fact that they dove deeper into the background of the family and the band. I find it disrespectful that anyone can say the family is capitalizing off Selena's name when they had the greatest loss but also were the band from the beginning. I personally enjoyed seeing every step that the group and Selena had to take before making it.",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2020,stefstars,5," Corny... but improves in Part 2
","My uncle put it best, ""it can't decide if it wants to be a comedy or a drama."" Some shows are able to pull off both genres, but this show can't. The comedy can be awkwardly delivered and the dramatic moments are comedic, take for example the ending of part 1. Chris gets kicked off the tour bus, Selena looks out to him brokenhearted and the ""Ayyyyy como me duele"" line from 'Como La Flor' plays in the background with the happy keyboard melody that follows. I had to laugh.",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2020,marymcfarland-01866,2," Just watch the movie instead...
","This series moves so slowly, it lulled me to sleep. I couldn't get past the 2nd episode. Performances are very unemotional and flat....the opposite of the actual Selena. The casting is simply not good. Just watch the 1997 movie and call it a day.",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2020,TwinMeag1,7," Part 1's an Overall Good Time
","While it may be called Selena, the series is really about the Quintanilla family's journey together. Beginning with the Queen of Tejano music's birth and following their various struggles and successes, this show will leave a smile on your face. Along with embracing the family's Mexican American roots, the musical moments will reignite your love for Selena y Los Dinos' songs and have you wishing against reality that a happier ending was on the horizon 25 years after the superstar's tragic end. Part 1 is feel-good family fare just in time for the holiday binge season, but you may shed a nostalgic tear or two.",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2020,daycmane,7," Give it a chance!
","I was looking forward for this show and so far, I'm enjoying it.
Before anything, for all people out there saying ""the actress doesn't look like Selena, her hair doesn't look like Selena's"" .. just do a little research and you'll find out that Selena actually had pretty curly hair and in her earlier years she did rock her curls! Only later she started to style her hair in a different way. You'll see that her hair curls and color actually looked like that before... Later on in the show you'll see she changes her style as she matures and becomes a woman!
I am, like many people, a huge fan of the movie with JLo, but obviously they speeded up in order to make a 2 hours movie about her life, the series portrays a more detailed and slower paced timeline. So they actually did a great job by showing her hair like that. Just give it some time because the series is showing her earlier years and the process of her becoming the Selena we know.
Yes, there are some negative aspects, but I think that it's overall consistent and well portrayed. Sometimes the acting isn't the best performance, but it isn't THAT bad either.
Obviously the actress can't dance as JLo, hasn't the same curves as JLo , but she's good and as far as I know, Selena's family chose and approved her to play Selena... That has to mean something. Just enjoy the series for what it is. Don't compare to the movie. It's a different kind of magic and it's great that her memory is being honored.",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2020,JuYoAvGi,1," Definite Cash Grab For Everyone Involved. No Substance Whatsoever
","My title pretty much says it all. I tried to give it a chance, but this is nothing more than a cookie cutter image of what everyone assumed Selena was. You don't really learn much about who she is as a teenager and woman and her background. This show is very much focused on the family - the father and brother in particular. I would not waste your time watching this if you're hoping to see an in-depth story of Selena's life. I won't be tuning in for part 2.",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2020,usobryson,2," It's the Abraham Show!
","If they had accurately titled this series ""Abraham: How A Man Built An Empire On The Backs of His Children"" I wouldn't be disappointed because I'd have known what to expect. This isn't about Selena, it's about her Dad and brother. And though I really like Christian Serratos, she just isn't working as Selena. She seems uncomfortable in the role and what minimal screen time she does have, just sees her giggle and lip sync. Poorly.
As stated before, her wigs are hilariously awful so be prepared for that! I honestly don't think I'll watch any future seasons because it's been pretty boring thus far.",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2020,Calicodreamin,6," Disappointing
","All of the pieces are there, good costuming, good sets, decent reproductions and lookalike cast. But it just feels off. The storyline is clinical, episodes lack flow and often feel disjointed, and the cast have no chemistry. This series has no heart, which is disappointing.",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2020,rocketwoods,5," It's okay...
","Episode one was okay for an introduction. The show feels like if Lifetime had a really big budget to make a biopic. It doesn't dive deep, not dark enough and feels like a viewership grab with her namr. Hopefully, part two learns enough from part one reviews.",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2020,doublek30,10," Excellent in depth look at the Q family
","If you're wanting this to be like jlo's 97' version then you're going in with the wrong expectations. This is more about the entire family and band than just Selena. Don't get me wrong, I love the 97' Selena, but it doesn't tell enough of the ""behind the scenes"" story.",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2020,dsj_78017,2," Do your homework Netflix...
",A LOT of inaccuracies in the timeline shots of the areas Selena lived in. This series was a disappointment. Seem more focused on the father for a redemption on what a GREEDY miserable pig he is in real life.,/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2020,tb4now,1," Was this story about Selena?
","Was this story about Selena, or her overbearing, controlling, self-righteous father? The story line portraying how perfect and happy this family ALWAYS were (even when the father was a controlling jerk) is so unbelievable. And the mannerisms of the actress playing Selena reminded me more of Dolly Parton (always giggling), than Selena.",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2020,Gigipure,2," Why on earth was this so cheesy?
","It's nearly unwatchable, it feels like a series of inside jokes you have no context for. Feels forced, flat, fake and very silly.",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2020,atrzhrz,4," The Abraham Quintanilla Netflix Series
","Yet another disappointment for Selena fans. A show titled Selena where she is mostly a background character is huge rip-off. Just like the movie, the show lacks so much of the Selena we all loved and miss. No one wants to hear about her dad's failed career, again. If anything he comes off as a controlling and possessive father who stole his children's childhood.
Just change the name of the show and save real Selena fans from wasting their time.",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2020,krazysoon,1," I...can't...keep..my...eyes..ZzZZZz
","That's pretty much how it went as I watched part one of the series. Super boring. Who asked them to make a Selena show? I think most of us were fine with the JLo adaption despite its numerous flaws. This on the other hand is a snoozefest. It's not as bad as the Aliyah movie jus yet but I'm not thrilled. It's apparent that her parents were just in it for the money. No way they could have agreed to this just out of the kindness of their hearts. This show is not an 8.0 or a 7.8. I expect that number to drop significantly. Lastly, imagine having to watch something with your wife and pretending to enjoy something that you have little to no interest in. I don't want to hurt her feelings but I've reached my breaking point. I guess I'll be sleeping on the couch until the series concludes. This show is a hard pass.",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2020,jerzio13,1," No more insomnia I just turn on Selena the series.
","Thank you Netflix for wasting our time and money again on rehashed crap. They did the movie with J-Lo we know the story we know the ending. Even, if I tried I couldn't spoil this series. We are in a depressing pandemic and you're going to feed us worthless entertainment. If you don't know the story then just go watch the movie. Don't waste 8 hours of your life watching the series just to get the same ending as the 2-hour movie. Besides, I couldn't make it through the first episode. I kept falling asleep. This series works better than Ambien for insomnia I've been sleeping like a baby and only had to run it for 10 minutes at a time the last week. So, thank you for that Netflix.",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv

8 December 2020,cjrocket89,6," Expected More, but Not Terrible
","Okay, so I just finished watching the Selena: The Series on Netflix. Here are my thoughts and I would love to hear yours...
FYI there are spoilers but not really because we all know her story.
Negatives:
1. Aside from not really looking like Selena, Christian Serratos makes very little effort to match the vibrancy and power that Selena commanded on stage and in life. Probably why the camera constantly panned to the audience when she was on stage. Her lip-syncing is very obvious and her attempts to perform Selena's dance moves, sometimes fall flat. It is also very apparent that they stuffed her butt, because the actress is so petite and thin that her body type wasn't even close to the curvaceous Selena. So I guess in an effort to remedy this, they decide to give her a J.Lo booty but because she is so thin, it looks very awkward.
2. You can tell that they made no effort to even try and get Chris's input because their romance is awkward, unnatural and at times unbelievable. He as a character is very bland, underdeveloped and unimpressive.
3. Spookie, looks SUPER awkward and weird with long hair and is a terrible lip-syncer.
4. There is a lot of bouncing around through the years, but you don't know it's happening, until about 2 minutes in because they give no timeline or explanation.
5. The pacing is not great. Sometimes they drag things out longer than they should and sometimes they speed through things to where you have no idea what just happened.
6. I'm still not sure what year or years any of it is happening because they don't give a year, except at the very beginning. There's no way of knowing how long they've been touring, which tour they're on, which album AB is writing songs for, etc.
Positives:
1. Although Ricardo Chavira isn't as intimidating as Edward James Olmos, I feel he gave a more well-rounded depiction of just how determined Abraham was to be a success. Although they'd never make him a villain, Ricardo makes it a point to show that Abraham wasn't the most loving or caring father, but was a man with a vision and this vision sometimes didn't take his kids needs or wants into account.
2. The dynamic between the 3 siblings is great and believable. They each constantly support one another and have each other's best interest, whenever making decisions that could affect the family.
3. Seidy Lopez, who places Marcella Quintanilla, the matriarch of the family, is exceptional. She does nothing but support and love her children and keep her husband grounded. I LOVE Constance Marie, who played her in the 1997 version, but she wasn't fleshed out enough to be significant to the plot or story. Whereas, Seidy is the complete opposite, you really feel her significance to Selena and Abraham's careers.
4. The series does a good job in showing us that Selena wasn't just an overnight success, although she was never without fans since she released her first single, she wasn't selling out the Alamodome right away. We see how adamant she was to make an English album and how the record label kept coming up with reasons to not let her.
5. Can we just talk about how AB is the unspoken hero of Selena's career? Like, she wouldn't have even had a miniscule career, if it weren't for A.B.'s constant work with songwriting, working with the band, finding band members and producing. A.B. became a one man, album making machine.
6. Spoiler Alert, but not really. I kind of enjoyed how they end it before her unfortunate and tragic death. I mean, if you know ANYTHING about her life, they give plenty of clues in the last 2 episodes that allude to her future but end the first half of the series on an optimist note, of a forbidden love.",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2020,kristinamarkovic-00420,4," Dissapoiting
","Gave up on the series after 2 episodes. I don't like how Selena is not the main focus, and the show can't top the original movie with JLo. Really dissapointing honestly",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2020,mnfwbc,10," Rating this a 10/10 to offset the idiots who gave it 1/10
",Title says it all. You people are so sensitive over the smallest things. This is pretty good show. 7.5/10 but you all want to rate it 1/10 like it's the worst thing Netflix has ever produced. Get over yourselves. You're not here to protect Selena's legacy. If you were think of the new fans who never knew of Selena and will now possibly be introduced to her music through this story. You can. Because a lot of you are self-entitled and expect everything to be perfect. If you want Jennifer Lopez just go watch the movie again. Give me a break.,/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2021,xtinevelvet,3," Unfortunate
",Saccharine and Lifetime-y. Selena is written like a Disney Princess instead of a real person. I'm assuming that is because her family was involved in the production of this series. It really does her memory a disservice not portraying her as the nuanced woman she likely was. This was a real missed opportunity.,/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2020,jarred_trujillo,6," Border Line abusive father
","Is this a show about selena or her over controlling father? This show is alright, but it's hard watching this dad care more about money, working his kids Like slaves, and becoming famous than he actually cares about his family. If this is anywhere close to the truth it's sad. None of his kids had a normal childhood, and whats depressing is none of them realize it. Maybe if this guy cared more about his family and not fame, his daughter would still be alive today.",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2020,emysanchez-12177,1," Watch the 1997 movie instead!!!!
","Nope, didn't like it. The actress looks nothing like her, her makeup does but her features don't. She looks kinda goofy. The ""teen"" version of herself is horrible! It was confusing cause the actors look too old to play teen characters. It's uncomfortable to watch. Why did we need a series? The movie is well written and didn't feel I needed to know extra details.
You can tell the directors and actress didn't try to connect with who Selana was, they just went based on what seems trendy. I don't recommend watching this. I think the ones giving it above 5 stars are young kids that are new fans to Selena and maybe never heard of her 'till now. Sorry Netflix! This was not good, but it'll be in the top 10 for a couple weeks due to curiosity.",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2020,sloanheather-65053,2," Skip it and watch the Jlo movie
","Really disappointing. I like the Selena actress, but she was wrong for this part. She's also too old to be trying to play a 17-23 year old. This whole thing feels like it was made to please her dad. Yikes.",/review/rw6341227/?ref_=tt_urv
