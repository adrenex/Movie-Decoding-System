24 December 2006,mjw2305,8," Great Vampire Flick
","Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade, a half human, half vampire known the daywalker. He has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. Since he teamed up with whistler (Kris Kristofferson) he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries, but omnipotent overlord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with the humans (Food as he calls them) and he plans to waken the blood god and take control of the world.",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2015,ivo-cobra8,10," The best vampire slaying movie ever my number one favorite Blade film
","Blade (1998) is the best action/horror vampire slaying movie ever made! I always have enjoyed watching Blade. My number one favorite Blade film I love this film to death. It is one of the best action sci-fi films of all time. Wesley Snipes best role till it's days ever! No one can play Blade like Wesley Snipes did! Blade is not an origin story, but it is a real world of darkness. Blade is just so bad and anti-hero which is perfect for the world he drives in. It is my favorite comic book Vampire movie. I love this film, I love the action and I love everything in it! I love Wesley Snipes and Kris Kris Kristofferson so much they have such a chemistry between each other. Wesley Snipes Kicks ass!!!!! This is the most super hero Vampire slayer film ever made! ",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2012,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,8," ""Blade"" is a strong, mature comic-book film, with outstanding performances and a unique visual style...
","Stephen Norrington's 1998 release ""Blade"" (based on the Marvel comic character) is the film that arguably lead to the recent trend of comic-book movies. It's success (along with that of ""X-Men"") caused people to do something they always should have- take comics seriously as an art form and a medium for storytelling. The film is an incredible, Gothic ride with great performances and unique visuals, and should be seen by any fan of action, horror or film in general.",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2004,bob the moo,," Enjoyably stylish flick that gets the dark tone almost right
","Blade was only a foetus when his mother was attacked by vampires and left for dead.  When he is born he is born a half-breed.  As an adult he has been joined by Abraham Whistler, a vampire hunter, to fight the secret war against the vampire culture.  He hunts the impure-blood vampire Deacon Frost who plans to summon La Magra - the Blood God.",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2019,RatedVforVinny,8," A true blood, Vampire classic.
","A superior vampire action movie, featuring a very impressive Wesley Snipes. The martial arts (stunts) are amazing and so are the groundbreaking visual effects. The musical score is magnificent and really drives the whole experience through a roller-coaster ride, of over-the-top blood-letting. Excellent supporting performance from Kris Kristofferson, in the part of his side-kick whistler. 'Blade' is not just any movie that is made and then goes away. Subsequently the whole look and feel of this picture, has been highly influential in the Horror/Sci-fi genre.",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2001,supertom-3,10," Style, Class and gallons of blood!!
","This film is superb! Wesley Snipes Plays Blade the vampire hunter with pure class, he kicks butt in such a fluid and violent way that would make Bruce Lee proud. The movie is a fast paced, thrill ride of action and superb stunts. The first action scene and last are outstanding and Wesley looks like a Terminator as he runs around wiping out all suck heads. The script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too. Wesley should have done more action films than he has, i know he is a very good actor and in this he is not streched as much as in his more comic or drama roles but as far as action stars go he is the best actor of them all, only Bruce Willis, Stallone and perhaps Tom Cruise (if he counts as an action star) come close. Also aswell as Wesley being quality, Steven Dorff is also very good as the bad guy. It was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to Snipes should come across as menacing, but he does. Overall the film is sharp, stylish and i hope the sequal is done with the same sort of pace.",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2000,dee.reid,10," Fantastic thanks to Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff
","Blade is a great adaptation of the famous comic book series of the same name.  I'm actually surprised Entertainment Weekly gave it a D+.  Wesley Snipes is one of my favorite actors and is perfect for the role of the tortured half man, half vampire Blade.  Stephen Dorff is totally cool as Blade's young and psychotic arch-nemesis, Deacon Frost.  Blade's tight looking weapons too.  They range from a double-bladed boomerang to little capsules loaded with stuff that will blow up vampires.  Blade is a great film with two great stars, perfectly executed fight scenes, and lots of cool shots of vampires heads exploding. 10/10",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2020,view_and_review,9," Blade is Boss
","""Blade"" was awesome. Even more than ""X-Men,"" I think ""Blade"" helped set up all the brilliant Marvel movies to come. It was textbook. Our first introduction to Blade was a badass pose followed by cool butt-kicking. He was a sword-wielding, gun toting, kung-fu fighting, vampire killer. He was the whole package. And truly, I think this was Snipes first good movie since ""Demolition Man"" in 1993 or better still, ""White Men Can't Jump"" in 1992.",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2005,MinorityReporter,7," Very stylish and entertaining!
","It seems to me that a lot of people don't know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on par with X-Men, Daredevil, Punisher and the likes. What all these heroes (and in the case of X-Men hero group) have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel. Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who chased vampires because of a personal grudge and eventually facing of with Dracula himself and he was for lack of a better word boring. So boring in fact that the character was shelved and in fact never used in the Marvel universe. At least until he was reinvented.",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2001,Aaron1375,10," A very stylish movie.
","This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it.  It is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever.  I liked this one even more than X-men.  In fact, this movie is sort of a cross between X-men and the matrix and it came out before either.  Wesley Snipes does a great job with the character of Blade.  He is just not an emotionless super hero.  Also, this movie isn't sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating.  Sure comic books are for kids mainly, but I like a little more in my movies. Let's face it, if we were in these situations we would cuss up a storm to so it is more realistic.  This comic book adaptation also has something that many don't.  A good fight in the end between the bad guy and good guy. Let's face it, none of the Batman movies had a very good ending fight.",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2007,kosmasp,7," Brother Darkness walks at daylight
","Hope the summary line won't irritate you that much (it's a little homage to the Chappelle Show/Charlie Murphy, but also to the character Daywalker). But I'll try to put all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I didn't like in another paragraph, so it will be easier to read! ",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2020,BandSAboutMovies,8," Marvel starts here
","Say what you will about its CGI today, but if we didn't have 1998's Blade, we may have no Marvel Cinematic Universe. Let me tell you, there was probably no cooler hero than Wesley Snipes at this point in time. Ah, it's still pretty rad today.",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2003,customX13,9," The way a comic book flick should be made
","I didn't see this movie until it appeared on television because I was doubtful about comic flicks. Ever since the ""Batman"" series, ""Spawn,"" ""Judge Dredd,"" and many other pitiful p.g.-13 bombs, I dodged everything at all cost. I would question in my mind, ""why can't someone make a movie that is rated R and stays true to the story, how difficult is that?"" And finally my prayers have been answered with Blade. This movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence, blood, martial arts, weapons, fire, the good against evil, etc. Yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies, and most of them have bombed. But not Blade, the movie was filmed just right, not going overboard, delivering a good length and never a dull moment. Blade II is cool, but not as cool as the first. Blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks I've seen in a long time.",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2021,masonsaul,9," Incredible comic book film
","Blade is an incredible comic book film that combines multiple genres to create a stylish, thrilling and hyper-violent experience. Wesley Snipes is perfect as Blade, Kris Kristofferson, Donal Logue and N'Bushe Wright are all great and Stephen Dorff is terrific. Stephen Norrington's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed with solid action scenes. It's really well paced and the music by Mark Isham is really good. However, it's undermined slightly by poor CG.",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2015,Leofwine_draca,7," Full-blooded vampire action
","One of those films which is best to see at the cinema, due to the visual impact of the film in the many special effects and choreographed fight scenes within it. Forget watching LITTLE VOICE or some other film like that at the cinema, you don't lose anything when you see it on TV. When watching these kind of special effect epics, you simply have to be at the cinema. And I was. Myself and a friend had a choice between this, the PSYCHO remake, LITTLE VOICE or MEET JOE BLACK. And I'm glad we picked this one, as none of the others are as entertaining as this one was.",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv

30 July 2019,shovon-1,8," Has it''s Flaws but a Neat Stylish movie
","I saw it when it got released back in 1998.
I saw it again today July-2019, that's a 20 year aprrox. evolution on my overall psyche ...and I found it stylishly made even today, too. Judging with todays standards where we are bombarded with cgi in plethora ..name it.. avengers, spiderman, aquaman...etc etc. These are graphics made from software that was available in 1998, so they are not groundbreaking , but it passed off even today to label it ''stylishly made then''.
Wesley looks good, at times very good, Leather jacket and all and cool crew cut.
Bad Guy portrayed comes off with flying colours as the 'bad guy' .....chuckle.
where I recently gave Jhon wick-3 a 5 , I give this one a 8 ....in my eyes more stylish and carries more sensibility than Wick 3 -parabellum.",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv

","Vampires are living amongst us with the collaboration of those in power; they manage to keep a low profile though that is until upstart vampire, Deacon Frost, decides that the old order needs to be overthrown. Standing against the vampires is Blade, the 'Day Walker', a half vampire who has none of the usual vampire weaknesses and, with the help of a serum, can control his lust for blood. Other senior vampires look down on Frost because he was turned rather than born a vampire but unlike them he is interested in the past and has deciphered ancient text with tell how to summon the Blood God to do it he will require Blade's blood.",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2007,gavin6942,7," Good Comic to Movie Adaptation and Good Vampire Story
","Eric Brooks (Wesley Snipes), better known as Blade, is a half-human, half-vampire ""daywalker"" with all the advantages of being a vampire without most of the side effects (though he still craves blood). As such, he has made it his mission to stop the evil vampires (led by Stephen Dorff and Udo Kier) with the help of his sidekick, Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). As an age-old prophecy comes to fruition, time is of the essence to stop the vampires now... Traci Lords also appears.",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2020,BA_Harrison,8," A Marvel-lously enjoyable vampire flick.
","Long before the Marvel Cinematic Universe was a thing, director Stephen Norrington gave us Blade. Based on Marvel's comic-book series about a vampire hunter who is part bloodsucker himself, the film starred Wesley Snipes in the title role, with Stephen Dorff as his nemesis, nasty vampire Deacon Frost, who is attempting to take over the world by resurrecting an ancient 'blood god'.",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv

","I admit I go more for the traditional vampire tale, but this one is a real winner. Lots of way out graphics and good story to go with them made for an interesting 2 hours. There was  loads of gore with vicious blood suckers attacking mortals and even each other for control of the world. A good one for all us vampire lovers.",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2016,RowanMcBrowan,9," Brilliant vampire action thriller from the better half of the 90s
","Fantastically shot, well paced.. arguably Snipes' most impressive performance to date and lots of fun martial arts fight sequences involving swords and guns - not to mention the unique and timeless soundtrack. Blade is one of my favourite action movies of all time, up there with Die Hard and Predator.",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2019,classicsoncall,7," ""Sooner or later, the thirst always wins.""
","Lots of new vampire lore for followers to consider - vampires brand their half human surrogates with a tattoo on the back of the neck called a glyph, the scientific name for a vampire is 'hominus nocturna', and the Book of Erebus is the Vampire Bible. I didn't know any of these things going in, and it's the kind of stuff I look for whenever I take in another vampire flick. This one's two decades old now as I write this, so I'm a little late to the party, but I like to take in a vampire flick every now and then, as this one also checks off a box on a list of comic book inspired movie characters. This one's quite a bit on the gory side, probably more so than most, and it gets off to a bloody start with a vampire disco rave in which the fire sprinklers shower blood on the dance crowd in a maze of brilliant red. If this is what gets your juices flowing, the picture is probably made for you. The story itself features Wesley Snipes as a 'turned' vampire, i.e., not a pure blood, on a mission to rid the world of vampire evil. Aided and abetted by grizzled blood chemist Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), Blade (Snipes) is accompanied by once bitten, twice shy Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright) in a quest to put a fellow turned vampire Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) out of the world domination business. It pretty much boils down to blood-soaked spectacle cloaked in martial arts mayhem on Blade's part, with a curious cameo by a Jabba the Hutt inspired sack of flesh called Pearl (Eric Edwards). Definitely not for the faint hearted.",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2003,BradleyUK,8," Dark, Dangerous & Pure Fun
","If you like horror or action watch this film ASAP. If the opening scene doesn't get your adrenaline pumping then someone should check your pulse. Great Action, excellent casting and top one-liners. This is the only film I have seen in a cinema where the crowd applauded each chop, kick & punch thrown. Not perfection but who cares when films can be this much fun. Its a pure rush of dark comic book action. 9/10",/review/rw0445743/?ref_=tt_urv
