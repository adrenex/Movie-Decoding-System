26 January 2019,ThomasDrufke,7," Window into the Service Industry
","If not for anything else, I love movies that give the audience a 'slice of life' glimpse into a certain person's lifestyle. Support the Girls does that in the way of showing what it takes (physically and emotionally) to manage a business/restaurant. It's pretty much all told in one restaurant (Hooters type) as Lisa (Regina Hall) sees her viewpoint change during one fateful day 'in the office'. If it weren't an independent film, with more advertising behind it, I would think that maybe Hall could have gotten some Oscars love for her performance. She's absolutely delightful to watch, as is Haley Lu Richardson, who is quickly jumping up the charts of young stars to watch for. It doesn't have a huge plot or any twists and turns, but it was a consistently enjoyable 90 minutes of a life that I was not previously accustomed to.",/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2018,ikadery,7," A rare film about everyday Americans
","It's a rare film that showcases the hardships of everyday Americans. Hollywood seems to be too busy nowadays with Superhero films, Sci-fi, Historical dramas etc. and seems to have forgotten about the dreams and hardships of average Americans. This film tries to showcase that, and it succeeded without being overly dramatic. Regina Hall delivered an excellent performance in this film.",/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2018,matdog321,7," Well, I liked it
","Support The Girls was an odd one. It started off promising as an offbeat comedy drama, then steered completely into drama territory. Regina Hall as an always-positive-strict-and-firm-manager was charming to watch as she desperately tried to weave through multiple problems at once during the early morning, stealing almost every scene she's in, and the supporting characters (mostly the girls employed by Regina's character) carry the film well too, especially during scenes of Regina intereacting with these girls almost like a surrogate. For the most part it was interesting to see the work relations of these characters, becoming more evident as the movie went on that the supposed ""sisterhood"" of these employees that is mentioned early in the film isn't just work motivation but what feels like an actual family. If you like independent dramas then check this out, but if you are expecting an easy string along plot with a feel good vibe avoid this one. I'm not sure what the complete message of it was, but admittedly in the end I was left wanting more. That's not to discredit the touching ending of how a manager and her employees share a thick as blood bond even after the chaos that ensues, which is what pushed me to write this review because I thought at least that deserved some praise, but the climax leading up to the final scenes just felt very rushed and hard to process exactly what it was all for. Some might say this was a boring film but it worked for me, it kept me interested to see how it would all unfold, eagerly waiting for an either positive or negative outcome for each little problem our protagonist dealt with, if you stumbled across this movie and were intrigued enough to look at the reviews, just see it for yourself. It's by no means terrible.",/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2018,Red_Identity,," Fantastic film with a lot of nuance
",Support the Girls: This was an incredibly surprising film in the amount of nuance it contained in its storytelling. It's honesty one of the best screenplays of the year and one of the most pleasant surprised.,/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv

","Despite the false genre promotion and IMDb lie about male nudity, I still got a good movie out of it.",/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2018,Aktham_Tashtush,4," Just not feeling it ... at all
","I mean,, the plot seems purposeful an all, but the movie itself was just slow and the script is a kinda disconnected and all over the place,",/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2018,AlGranthamMusic,5," Uninspired and Flat
","Not sure what to make of this film. It's branded as a comedy, but it's not funny. As a drama, it lacks a compelling plot and character development. The lead performance by Regina Hall - as others have mentioned - is fantastic. I wish she was in a better film.",/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2018,TxMike,," Slice of life, Hooters manager has a difficult day.
","My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library. I am a Haley Lu fan, plus it was filmed right up the road in Austin, Texas.",/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2018,TheBigSick,," Another solid step for Richardson
","From The Edge of Seventeen, Split, to Columbus and this Support the Girls, Haley Lu Richardson is consistently shining in critically acclaimed features and constantly making progress in acting as a young rising star. In this movie, her role is totally different from her previous ones and she is simply unrecognizable. The performances of Regina Hall are also memorable. This is a hilarious comedy for female audiences.",/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2022,twonebody,3," Good actors boring story
",Regina Hall was engaging but I couldn't get into this lackluster story. The brightest spot in the movie was the performance of Haley Lu Richardson. In this comedy drama Haley provide most of the comedy that was much needed for this dreary movie.,/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2019,donaldricco,7," Sweet tattoo!
","Basically, this film shows us a day in the life of a woman who manages a ""Hooters"" type sports bar named Double Whammies. It's definitely not one of Lisa's better days! Though slow at points, I liked the movie and it's realistic feel. Regina Hall is great, and Haley Lu Richardson and Shayna McHayle are pretty darn good too! (I think I'm in love with Haley!) I also loved Lea DeLaria as Bobo, a very protective, nosy regular! The end of the movie should have been in a different place, but it's a good watch and worth the view!",/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2019,nogodnomasters,3," Rule 1. No Drama
","The film is billed as a comedy but turned out to be all drama. The only irony was rule one was ""No Drama."" Lisa (Regina Hall) is the manager of a Texas restaurant called ""Double Whammies"" because all the good large breast synonyms are taken. She has issues with the boss and some of the girls. Oh...and the cable is out!",/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2019,varun-25071997,8," Cheerful
",One of the sweetest movies I have seen. Haley Lu Richardson & Regina Hall are amazing. The story always relates to a lot of lower middle class girls around the world.,/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2021,dommercaldi,2," Another Feminist Movie That Focuses More On The Message Than The Actual Film
","Pros:
1. Regina Hall (Lisa) gives as good as a performance as the script allows.
2. Regina Hall, Haley Lu Richardson (Maci) and Shayna McHayle (Danyelle) all have really good chemistry together.",/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2018,lisparizzi,7," True to life movie about the service industry
","I really enjoyed this and was very surprised when I saw the negative reviews here. I worked in the service industry when I was younger and so the movie felt very real - it is hard to explain how close you get to others in the team in that sort of workplace, and this movie did an amazing job at presenting it. The acting was wonderful, and each character brought something interesting to the table. However, the pacing is slow, so will probably not please everybody. Recommend to anyone who's ever worked in the service industry before and is looking for a solid drama movie.",/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv

10 January 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," Low-key but enjoyable.
","'Support The Girls (2018)' is, essentially, a slice of life drama surrounding the underappreciated manager of a ""sports bar with curves"". It's a rather nuanced affair with moments of both humour and heart subtly slipped into its otherwise straightforward proceedings. The performances are understated but great, giving each character a palpably 'real' feel. The story as a whole achieves this, too, as it feels markedly grounded throughout. Its drama never feels heightened or 'Hollywood' and the experience is all the better for it. When it comes down to it, though, the piece just isn't all that memorable. It's entertaining enough in the moment but it doesn't really have a lasting impact. It also isn't massively compelling, despite being engaging and enjoyable on the whole. It's a solid piece of work, with a good theme and a distinct setting. Its message is low-key but commendable, always there even if it isn't directly stated. Like, I said, it's entertaining enough. 6/10",/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2019,dmonroe-19031,10," Edgy but tender movie, not exactly a comedy
","Small premise, huge impact. It's an indie film, OK? Don't expect blockbuster. The characters are winning, the acting great. It felt so working-class real. The lead is luminous in every scene in a way that's not obvious until there's a scene without her, and you find yourself just missing her face. The ending is pure genius.",/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2020,cherold,6," downbeat slice-of-life drama doesn't have much point to it.
","This movie starts pretty well as a mildly comedic indie movie about Hooters-style restaurant manager Regina Hall (excellent) dealing with her job and her messy personal life. But in spite of bright spots, like Haley Lu Richardson as a sweet, somewhat dim waitress seemingly born for the job, the movie becomes increasingly dour.",/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2018,apjc,7," Better than I expected.
","It's one of those offbeat films you can just watch and enjoy without anything special to recommend it. A day in the life of a sports bar manager, under stress and personal problems, with some laughs along the way. Only real message it gives is man or I should say women management is the true measure of how good a manager and business is.",/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2019,ersbel,," I have no idea what this movie is about
",I have spent more than half an hour trying hard to figure out what this movie is about. Or who is the main character. Or if there is some evolution of some sort. A badly made reality TV show is usually more entertaining and has better outlined characters.,/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2018,mureampikebabliha,3," No emotions
","Well, what can i say... 
This film did not wake up any emotions. I did not smile even once during the whole movie and this was supposed to be a comedy. There was no excitement in the movie and I looked at the movie when my face was completely neutral.",/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2018,skfan50,2," Lackluster film, at best
","Coming off of seeing Regina Hall in Girls Trip, I thought this had potential to be a decent flick. Unfortunately, it comes across as a poor-mans ""Waiting..."" without any of the comedy.",/review/rw4336623/?ref_=tt_urv
