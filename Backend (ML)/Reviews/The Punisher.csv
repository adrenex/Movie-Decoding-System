16 June 2021,Supermanfan-13,10," Jon Bernthal is perfect as the Punisher!
","If there's one word to describe The Punisher it would have to be...awesome! It's one of the most gritty, violent thrillers I've ever seen! There have been a bunch of different versions of The Punisher over the years but Jon Bernthal is absolutely, without a doubt, the best ever and it's not close! He's such an underrated actor who's great in just about everything he's done. Hopefully, they'll bring him back to reprise the role in the future because no one will be able to top what he did with the role! I really can not recommend this show enough, so just go watch it!",/review/rw8837053/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,10," Awesome!
","As a huge fan of Marvel I'm a little biased because I pretty much like everything they put out. My bias aside, The Punisher is terrific! It's actually my favorite Marvel show (along with Daredevil). If you don't believe me just read through the reviews here and look at the ratings. Even the critics loved this. Jon Bernthal was born to play The Punisher. He's easily the best part of the show. He's one of the most underrated actors working today. Everything he's in is great! This is a show that you'll want to binge as quickly as you can, it's that good. It's too bad that Netflix couldn't renew their contracts with Marvel and they had to stop making the Netflix Marvel shows because every single one of them was great! Now that they're on Disney they can bring these wonderful characters back. They already started to with Daredevil and Kingpin and just renewed Daredevil for another season. Now they have to do the same for The Punisher, Luke Cage and Jessica Jones. At least bring them back into the MCU somehow. If you're a Marvel fan then this is a must watch!",/review/rw8837053/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2021,aastikhimta,9," Such a great show
",Season 1- The storyline of this show was great . The main character and story was dark . I really liked how they build up the whole story for The punisher. There were some good action scenes. But Jon really nailed his role. This guy really made this show more fun while being The punisher. Ending was great too. 9/10.,/review/rw8837053/?ref_=tt_urv

4 November 2022,roaches_97,8," Really good when it wants to be
","Punisher is solid. It's probably the second-best Netflix Marvel show behind Daredevil. The first half of season 1 is okay but it becomes really great in the last few episodes, and season 2 has the opposite problem, where the first half Is excellent but the second half drags, although the last few episodes get a bit better. Jon Bernthal is perfect as Frank Castle. In fact, this entire Marvel TV show universe has great casting across the board. The action is pretty bad at the beginning of season 1 but gets much better as the series continues. It never entirely becomes Daredevil levels of awesome, but it is really good in its own right. But I think the biggest thing holding this show back is the fact that the Punisher stuff in Daredevil season 2 really should have been its own series. Removing Punisher from Daredevil season 2 could have fixed a lot of the problems with it and made it a more focused story. There could have been one season of Punisher containing the stuff from Daredevil, including the trial, and then season 2 could have been Punisher properly avenging his family. This is probably the best adaptation of the Punisher so far, and I have no faith that Disney will do the character justice, so I'd say give this a watch if you're a fan of the comics. Watch it in between Daredevil seasons 2 and 3. Season 2 of Punisher technically takes place after season 3 of Daredevil, but neither show has any impact on the other, and Daredevil season 3 works as a really great finale for the Netflix Marvel shows.",/review/rw8837053/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2019,ahmetkozan,10," Too much death too much blood!
","After the first season, with the release of the second season, I finished the series in a breath. I think this is the best project of the Marvel-Netflix partnership. It is a solid series that has been achieved after the cancellation of many Marvel-Netflix joint projects.",/review/rw8837053/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2022,CANpatbuck3664,8," An Excellent Cast and Brutal Action Help The Punisher Deliver Solid Entertainment
","Jon Bernthal's turn as Frank Castle on season 2 of Daredevil completely stole the show. His intensity and conviction as The Punisher blew everyone away and he deservedly got his own series. His brilliant performance carries over into The Punisher series, he's not as emotionally vulnerable but the man knows how to grunt, scream and act like he's viciously ""punishing"" his enemies. He's a bull in a china shop, just like the character should be and he has great chemistry with all of his co-stars including Ben Barnes as his antagonist Billy Russo. Bernthal channels Castle's rage and pain into every interaction and he's great throughout. Ben Barnes has never really stood out in any performance I've seen (to this point) but I think he's just as good as Billy. They gave Russo a lot more dimension than I expected but Barnes is surprisingly adept at conveying his inner anguish and his struggle to accept the compromises he made for fortune and power. Because of Barnes' work, you want to trust Billy and you want to believe he can be redeemed. Amber Rose Revah also brings some humanity to Dinah Madani. Madani starts as the typical ""tough and no nonsense type"" but after she's manipulated by Russo, her layers are peeled back a little and her perspective shifts. Revah is adept at showing Madani at her strongest and at her weakest and she takes what could have been a stock police contact and makes it something more. Jason R. Moore and Ebon Moss-Bachrach are both really good as Curtis and David respectively. Jason especially helps humanize Frank and make Curtis a sympathetic ear to both friends and foes of Frank Castle. Deborah Ann Woll is a welcome return as Karen Page, her character's conflict and her compassion helps ground Frank and she still works well with Jon Bernthal.",/review/rw8837053/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2022,frankiesilver-91836,9," SEASON 1 REVIEW: One of the most impressively thought-provoking and bad*** superhero projects ever!
","So going into this show as a spin-off of Daredevil, it has some impossible shoes to fill, but when looking at it on its own it's really great. This is the most gruesome character MCU has done a project for and seeing more of the Punisher (and Karen Page) is fantastic.",/review/rw8837053/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2022,rossjackson2,9," Best show I've watched in a while.
",The Punisher has been on my list to watch for a while and finally got round to it. And what a show it is. It starts off a little slow in season 1 but when it gets into its stride it certainly gets into its stride. Jon Bernthal is truly amazing as the Punisher - such a great actor I think. There's also a great supporting cast. It's very violent in places but I don't mind that and the action scenes are great. But it's not all action as there's a good storyline for both seasons and good character development. Let's just hope they make a third season now it's on Disney+,/review/rw8837053/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2019,PCT1970,9," Everyday Joe Delivering Deserved Punishment
","I'm not a Marvel or DC universe expert but I have watched many series and films, which I've enjoyed, so I do have something to compare this series to. This series is one of the more inventive and ingenious in it's genre. I think it has to do with the main character being a real person with no super powers relying on his past military expertise to conduct business. The series has exceptional directing, writing, cinematography, soundtrack and acting. Bernthal is commanding portraying a vengeful husband seeking justice for the murder of his family who has now become a vigilante for justice. The plot is clever, witty, action packed, duplicitous and cathartic. The supporting cast does a fine job as well. The second season lived up to the first and is as good if not better. The series and main character should strike a chord for the every day person who believes that sometimes justice needs to be and is better served by one's self.",/review/rw8837053/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2020,Prashast_Singh,10," I can now understand why everyone wants a third season...
","Netflix just never stops surprising me. The Punisher is an outstanding action series that only gets better with every episode. Having read no comics but seen only the Thomas Jane version movies (The Punisher, 2004 and Punisher: Dirty Laundry, 2012), I was already a fan of the character before starting this series recently. Having finished it last night, I can assure you I'm a bigger Punisher fan now and I can truly understand why fans still want a third season.",/review/rw8837053/?ref_=tt_urv

28 February 2022,Leofwine_draca,8," The best of Marvel TV
","THE PUNISHER is the best of the Marvel/Netflix TV shows alongside DAREDEVIL. In fact I think it has a slight edge over the latter; the characters feel more human and the action has that extra touch of intensity about it. The first season has a strong first episode but then becomes a slow burner until the second half, while the second kicks off with a bang and manages to carry on the momentum throughout. Great, violent action bolstered by solid plotting and an excellent turn from Bernthal.",/review/rw8837053/?ref_=tt_urv

","Former Marine Frank Castle (Jon Bernthal) is haunted by the murder of his family and his work for a secret off-the-books CIA operation in Afghanistan. He is assumed dead by everyone. He works at a construction site but even there, he cannot retire from his Punisher duties. He is found by tech-savvy David Lieberman, another member of the secret CIA operation, in hiding after a corrupt cop presumably killed him. Agent Dinah Madani from Homeland Security is tracking Frank Castle, not believing in his death. Frank insinuates himself into Lieberman's family. The two 'dead' men join forces to take down the corrupt CIA apparatus. In season 2, he is roaming America with a new identity from the CIA. He rescues a girl from a team of military mercenaries. She turns out to be a grifter with many aliases and being hunted by a powerful political family. Meanwhile, Billy Russo has escaped with the help of his therapist and Madani asks for Castle's help.",/review/rw8837053/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of my favourite shows, a must watch. Jon Bernthal embodies this role as the punisher and takes it to a new level.

17 October 2022,tobiaszaminer-34310,8," Good show
","The punisher was a good tv show in my opinon, because I rellly like Violent series and films. But i have to say it was at the beginning of both seasons pretty slow and boring, but as longer i watched it got better and better. John Berthal is a very good actor and fits PERFEKT as the Punsisher in my opinion. I hope that there is gonna be a third season some day because it was a huge cliffhanger at the end of season 2 (Disney should do something good and produce the third season as fast as possible). Overall a good TV-Show with a good actor as an impressive main charakter with a dark and tragic background story.",/review/rw8837053/?ref_=tt_urv

",I love how they introduced The Punisher in season 2 of Daredevil. It was a great introduction and the prison scene was brutal. I still can't decide if I like The Punisher more or Daredevil. I would definitely watch Daredevil before Punisher especially season 2 of Daredevil. Season 1 of Punisher was great I loved the scene where Frank realized Billy betrayed him. I mainly love that scene because for Billy to think Frank betrayed him in season 2 was a great touch and the same reaction from both of them. Overall I loved season 1 and wished Micro got mentioned in season 2. Season 2 was good but not as good as season 1. I think Billy Russo was awesome throughout the show same with The Punisher but something felt off for the last few minutes of the season 2 finale. Overall I loved this show and recommend.,/review/rw8837053/?ref_=tt_urv
