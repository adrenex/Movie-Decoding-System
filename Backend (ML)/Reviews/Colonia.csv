7 July 2018,follis12,10," This story is finally told in the right way
","The war in the Pacific was a hell of a lot different than the war in Europe. Of course both where terrible - full of death, sacrifice, and heroism. However, it seems the soldier's stories from the European theater have gotten a lot more press.",/review/rw6564883/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2014,SnoopyStyle,8," Different from Band of Brothers
","Ostensively, this follows 3 marines and their individual stories in the Pacific during WWII. Bob Leckie (James Badge Dale) is a small town reporter who join the marines at the start. Eugene Sledge (Joseph Mazzello) is a 90 pound weakling whose parents are reluctant to allow him to join. John Basilone (Jon Seda) comes from an Italian family who becomes a famous war hero.",/review/rw6564883/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2010,lbabe29,9," This is a brutal, epic, gripping and Incredibly acted series that shows the true horror war brings
","""The Pacific"" is Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg's epic 200 million dollar miniseries from the creators of the brilliant 2001 series ""Band Of Brothers'. Much like with Band Of Brothers, The Pacific gives us an unflinching look at the horrors of war, not just the physical but the mental horrors these men must face. As an audience you are pulled through this experience, watching in horror as limbs are torn from bodies and men are burned and mutilated. In a way even more distressing is watching the emotional scars and effects this has on our main characters. This is not a perfect series and does suffer from some major flaws but overall it's an extremely harrowing experience but one that is needed in an age where war is often glorified, this series does anything but that.

11 January 2020,janoffpeter,10," Gripping and Powerful
",The Pacific miniseries will leave many of you in a state of awe. What a cinematic achievement. The best of the best of what American entertainment has to offer. The scenes and emotions portrayed are so vivid and lifelike that you'll think you've been transported back in time to the pacific theater of war. History has told us how horrid the war against the Japanese was. A war of attrition. This series will take you there and slap you on the wrists and then the face and remind you of the truth. War is utter diabolical hell. And the guys that fought in the pacific during WW2 were tough as nails. Tougher. It's ugly and beautiful at the same time. Enjoy and take a history lesson. You'll thank your lucky stars you did.,/review/rw6564883/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2011,Leofwine_draca,6," Great - once it gets going
","Having enjoyed BAND OF BROTHERS, I was looking forward to watching this big-budget follow-up detailing the experiences of various soldiers fighting in the Pacific theatre during WW2. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the same level of quality as the earlier production, and indeed the whole series is beset with flaws that threaten to sink it before it gets going.",/review/rw6564883/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2010,fred-houpt,8," Part two of a powerful series
","I saw the first episode tonight and the first thing your mind does is compare. We see similar introductions to surviving American Marines (that were showcased by members of Easy Company in ""Band of Brothers""). The landing on the beach invites comparisons with Saving Private Ryan. SPR was a far more elaborate and bloody landing scene. In fact what was anticlimactic for the whole of the first episode is the small amount of ground battle on Guadalcanal than is yet to come. The hour whizzed by so fast it was over before I knew it. The main characters are introduced and the story has its foundations laid. From the (limited amount) of what I know of the Pacific battles, they were very long and took a huge toll on both sides as one side fought with determination to dislodge the Japanese invaders and as they got closer to the homeland, the Japanese fought with ferocious tenacity to hold off the American's at all costs.",/review/rw6564883/?ref_=tt_urv

","Please, for the love of God, please do not overlook this miniseries. I have seen way too many people who don't bother to see The Pacific because it wasn't like Band of Brothers. This was in no way, shape, or form meant to be like BoB. If you have studied WW2 at all, you would know that the war in the Pacific was a totally different war than the European theater.

",The Pacific does for the War in the Pacific theater. What Band of Brothers did for the European theater. It makes it more realistic. More understanding. and That's not an easy feat to do. As with Band of Brothers there is a large cast here . But the main focus is on only a few soldiers . Not surprising as the source mat√©riel is taken Robert Leckie's Helmet for my Pillow and Eugene Sledge's In with the old Breed. Both books present a often shocking and brutal picture of the war. The Main focus is PFC Robert Leckie. PFC Eugene Sledge. And Gunny Sgt. Medal of honor Winner John Basilone. And the others caught in their orbit.,/review/rw6564883/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2010,noelani54,9," Great job on a monumental task
","I couldn't tell you how many times I have watched Band of Brothers. I think it is the best production ever made. However, I resisted watching The Pacific. My father had five years active duty in the Marine Corps when I was born, and remained on active duty until I was 30 years old. I was ten when he left for Viet Nam, the first time, and in high school the next. I had friends whose fathers were seriously wounded, or killed, there. I have always felt like Marines are family, and any depiction of them being killed has always been hard to see. However, I finally decided to ""man-up"" and watch it, on Veteran's Day this year.",/review/rw6564883/?ref_=tt_urv

18 September 2022,percyporcelain,6," Looks great, sounds great, but the narrative sucks
","I bought this box set because I'd seen some fascinating historical documentaries about the war in the Pacific, notably the PBS America series. So I looked forward to seeing a good analysis of how it unfolded, how the strategy evolved and the sea and land battles intertwined. But I learned nothing. It's basically just bang-bang shoot 'em up battle scenes, admittedly good, with occasional departures (sometimes a whole episode) into a soldier's private life (e.g. Romance while billeted in Australia), but these feel kind of gratuitous, like a soppy ballad inserted in a funk band's LP to show they can do something else.",/review/rw6564883/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2010,jacksflicks,6," A Disappointment
","I don't compare the heroics of the European war with those of the Pacific war, but I've always been more in awe of the Pacific War. Unfortunately, this miniseries seems an afterthought, as if, after Band of Brothers, a Pacific vet went up to Spielberg and said, ""Hey, what about us?"" and Spielberg said, ""Oh, OK.""",/review/rw6564883/?ref_=tt_urv

4 September 2010,gezmek,7," Well worth the time
",I enjoyed this series very much and can see why there has been so many comparisons with Band Of Brothers. My observation is that in The Pacific many of the characters lack depth and development. The result was that I cared less when ill befell them than I did in Band of Brothers. I think that the first episode could have contained a lot more time letting us get to know the characters better before throwing them into battle.,/review/rw6564883/?ref_=tt_urv

24 May 2010,socceralex16,7," Its Lack of Character Development makes sense.
","Overall this show is not bad. Id even say it is good considering. But is it great, no. The main problem this show had was character development which many of these other reviews point out. But you must understand why. In Band of Brothers (BOB), most of the soldiers were alive during filming, and remembered so much that they were able to give detailed descriptions of themselves and their friends fallen in battle. This series didn't have that luxury. Only 3 men depicted were still alive during filming. That makes it very hard to portray individuals accurately with no one able to recall how they acted. So instead, understandably, they went in a different direction and focused on the war. Of the 10 episodes, 9 had major battle sequences. BOB had only 7 episodes with such battles. 6 if you take away episode 6 Bastogne as it focuses on Doc Rowe and his problems getting medical supplies and the hellish cold those men went through. Not to mention the entire first episode of BOB was all boot camp for that much needed character development. In The Pacific, the first time you see the soldiers together its as they are shipping out for battle. I wont go on and on like some, but basically if you go in not expecting to care for the characters and to enjoy the reenactments of the battles you will like it. But if your a true critic, it will be only good at best. And thats to bad. Of course rumors are already circling for a 3rd installment focusing on Africa. Wonder if that will happen.",/review/rw6564883/?ref_=tt_urv
