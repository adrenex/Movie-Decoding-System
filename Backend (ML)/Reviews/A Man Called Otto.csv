22 April 2007,caa821,9," Chris Elliott is just plain funny
",Those who gained their initial fame on television -- even at the highest level and with top popularity -- have often found their feature films finishing at the other end of the scale. Bill Cosby and Ray Romano are two examples of this -- Bill Murray one of the few exceptions.,/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2007,rich56,8," God, I love this movie...
","No, not in the 'it's so bad it's good' way. I truly think it's one of the funnier comedies of the last 20 years or so. Perhaps a lot of it depends on how you feel about Chris Elliot to begin with. I think he's priceless. Used to love his old show Get A Life and have followed him ever since. The plot of this, kind of a twisted version of Captains Courageous, really doesn't matter. What's fun are the numerous sight gags, Elliot's constant barrage of sarcastic one-liners and the generally anything goes attitude of the whole enterprise. The ship's crew, filled with a number of character actors we're not used to seeing in this kind of thing, are a wonderfully sleazy bunch. David Letterman's hysterically amateurish cameo at the beginning is the stuff of legend. ""Wanna buy a monkey?"" Ha! OK Citizen Kane it ain't. I own that on DVD btw. Right next to it is Cabin Boy.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2013,siavash_khavarnejad,10," Comedy Classic!
","I am really shocked by this movie's super low rating of not even five out of ten, I figured it probably would be kind of low since it was not as good as Chris Elliott's TV show Get a Life and a lot of people didn't like his humour or this movie, but it was pretty good. It's obviously not for everyone with a really ""out there"" sense of humour but for what it was it was really funny, with a lot of laugh out loud gut busting moments. David Letterman's ""wanna buy a monkey?"" cameo is fantastic and Chris Elliott is great as the full of himself, super annoying rich kid turned cabin boy. I really recommend it if you like any of his other work or Get A Life.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2014,StevePulaski,6," A cult film for the curious
","When I was a freshman in high school, scared and nervous of the environment around me, I found solace in my year-long Television course, which was an introductory course in the forte of filmmaking and the behind-the-scenes techniques of Television shows. It was a break from the dreariness of perfunctory science, social studies, math, and English, and allowed me to interact with upperclassmen. I was one of two freshmen in the course, since most were thinking ahead to college by doing band or taking a foreign language. I remember telling my quirky Television teacher about my love for film, and how I was in the early stages of being an online film critic, before he hit me with a question I always remembered. ""Have you seen Cabin Boy?,"" he asked. After I stated I hadn't even heard of it, he gasped and demanded, ""you make time for Cabin Boy."" He would demand that of me for the rest of the year in nearly every film-conversation we had.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2005,boondoggle129,10," Movie Makes fun of overeducated, pampered snobby critics
","Critics hate this film because they see so much of themselves in the protagonist: A character who spends his whole overeducated, over-pampered life sneering at every one and every thing else, the self-appointed know it all who mocks everything but produces nothing.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2001,farnum,," A bawdy romp that Chaucer would be proud of!
","While a number of critics have discussed at length ""Cabin Boy""'s allusions to earlier sea epics, such as ""Mutiny on the Bounty"", ""Moby Dick"" and ""Humanoids of the Deep"", surprisingly little attention has been devoted to it's social commentary.  Although it may, perhaps, be an overstatement to call Chris Elliot's script ""revolutionary"", its message has a decidedly socialist bent. In fact, I would venture to say that none of Elliot's other work, prior to OR since ""Cabin Boy"" has had a comparable impact on the way ship captains treat their crew - or for that matter, on the labor movement in general in this country.  It's safe to say that the success of ""Cabin Boy"" is a product not only of Elliot's vision, but also a fortunate case of being ""the right film at the right time"", so to speak.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2005,moore9157,10," misunderstood comedy is a true masterpiece
","what can be said of cabin boy's idiotic genius? Chris Elliot proves he is the master of absurd comedy in this one of a kind, off the wall masterpiece! I'm almost ashamed to love it so dearly. The movie propels itself through a bizarre mythological backdrop using Elliots uncanny knack for brilliant, stupid, amazingly funny dialog and antics. Cabin boy stays true to all that is Elliot from beginning to end. It doesn't change its mind halfway through, and is too unassuming to attempt to deliver any heartwarming morally relevant conclusion. Chris Elliot's antihero is so lovably hate able that you feel the desire to both punch him in the face, and gently rock him to sleep in a comfy blanket. This comedy is probably not for everyone, but the payoff for those who understand its naive, cynical hilarity is worth the rental fee. Hell, you can buy it for under six bucks almost any where. It is truly a misunderstood work of pure cinematic bliss.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2002,perfectisolation,5," Underrated, ahead of its time (Dumb and Dumber, Jackass, even Fight Club etc)

23 January 1999,grogan,9," The Odyssey for Stoners
","Fuse literary themes like Candide and the Odyssey with Chris Elliott's relentless style of moronic comedy and you have a movie people will either love or hate. A wicked cast and classic special effects make up for a somewhat lethargic pace in action, but the booty of comedy in this movie make up for the long nights at sea. Watch it, own it, love it.  I do.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 1999,SanDiego,," Funnier than Meatballs 3.
","Films are so much better today than anything made more than twenty years ago, especially comedies.  This is one of the funniest films ever made. Just compare this film to anything that Jack Oakie was in and I think I can prove my point. Up until Cabin Boy I would have guessed no film could have been made to beat the comedy classic Meatballs 3, but as much as I adore that film, Cabin Boy surpasses it.  If you like Meatballs 3 definately see Cabin Boy.  If you don't like Meatballs 3, see Cabin Boy anyway because it is a funnier film.  If you haven't seen Meatballs 3, skip it and watch Cabin Boy, it's a funnier film.  Fans of Cabin Boys will tend to be younger and intelligent and critics will tend to be older and dumber.  David Letterman does a cameo, but it's not very funny...probably because he's old.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv

13 December 2002,LebowskiT1000,8," Bizarre comedy, but still fun to watch.
","I would have a hard time saying that this is a hilarious movie, but it's got some really good stuff to it.  The film is just plain odd from beginning to end.  Whoever thought this stuff up (I guess that would be Adam Resnick and Chris Elliot) has quite an imagination.  As far as the comedy goes, it's actually pretty funny most of the time.  I don't think I ever found myself really busting up, but I did laugh quite a few times.  If you liked Chris Elliott's comedy from Saturday Night Live, than I would hope that you find this film funny.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2004,leechfoot,10," The Greatest Movie Ever Made by Humans
","The fish stick kitten scene made me laugh so hard I missed most of the rest of the movie, but I'm sure it was also great. I don't think this movie will ever get the recognition it deserves. Mostly because Chris Elliot is kind of unpleasant. Not to me. Well, okay yes to me. He is unpleasant to me, but in a good way. People should just lighten up and realize that this movie is brilliant. Come on. True I do like this movie a lot because of scenes that are actually in Get A Life, Chris Elliot's TV show. And that's not really fair. But that episode where Martin Mull comes over and they go to that brothel while they play ""Afternoon Delight?"" That was so funny that it kind of bleeds over into Cabin Boy and makes that funny too.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2005,thiudans,10," Cabin - Oh Boy!
","Chris Elliott's sense of humor is of the bizarre kind, and requires for the deepest understanding thereof on all levels an extremely cultivated intellect and simultaneous rejection of that traditionally conceived as the predominating cultivated aesthetic. That being said, you will not, I'm sure, misunderstand my assertion that this film is not for everyone. Perhaps it is not even for you. As you see, it has received paltry scores from the greatest part of the spectating crowds who vote on IMDb.com; but should one follow them? They have also selected such trash as Donnie Darko for placement among their trophy shelf of film. I reaffirm therefore the peculiar genial and aesthetic disposition requisite fully to enjoy Cabin Boy. It is as though one must become dumb and wise at the same time, one must see with the eyes of a fool and the heart of a sage. The film student, who possesses in varied solution this talent, will also notice how exquisite, how carefully adorned the sets are, how precise the sceneries, how composed the artful tableaux, how peerless and true the cast, how poetic each word spoken.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2017,13Funbags,8," Classic Chris Elliot.
","I heard a lot bad things I heard about this movie, so I avoided it for a long time.What a mistake that was.I should have known not to listen to other peoples opinions on anything.They are rarely right.Not to mention that I have been a Chris Elliot fan for as long as I can remember.I understand why people don't like this movie.It's because they don't understand comedy.That's something I have been dealing with since I was a small child and it looks like that will never change.I can't help people who laugh at low level comedy but I can point out why they are wrong.The average American has trouble seeing anything as funny if it's not about a dumb fat guy and his hot, bitchy wife.Maybe that's because that's what their real life is, I don't know.But I do know this movie is hilarious.The only reason I didn't give it ten stars is because of all the material Chris rehashed from Get A Life.I know it's fairly common for people to do that but that doesn't make it cool.What surprised me most is that it's really a sort of spoof of the old Sinbad movies.There are crazy monster fights and a shark man(played by Russ Tamblyn!).Not having seen those movies could make some humor deficient people not like this one.Plus, this is David Letterman's only movie appearance ever and it's text book Dave.This is a must see for fans of true comedy.If you enjoy Bill Murray films you probably won't get it.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2014,PartialMovieViewer,10," The Best Movie About Fancy Lads and Fish stick Kitties Ever Made
","I actually saw this movie when it first hit the theaters. It had kind of an odd affect on me, I was not sure if I had just wasted my money or did I really like this movie. So in order to settle this personal dilemma I saw it again. Never a doubtI really like this movie. I liked it so much I purchased my own copy and actually watch it once in a while. Digesting this flick one has to appreciate Chris Elliot's mastery of humor and his solid grasp on the bazaar. I wish he would do more movies I enjoy his sense of humor. Not being bombarded with CGI was great. Now I am not completely knocking CGI. Lots of that stuff is very important when a movie sucks or is grossly lacking in other areas. This movie played well. It's probably too politically incorrect for present times – but not to worry – I was not offended. And for methat is all that matters. This was such a good movie I actually wanted to sign on as part of the crew of 'The Filthy Whore' and munch on fish stick kitties.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2003,TheBrade,10," The Most Hilarious Movie Ever.
","Face it, we all have different senses of humor, so a movie like ""Cabin Boy"" will appeal strongly to some, while others will despise it. Personally this movie fits my style of comedy perfectly. I love non-sequiturs, absurdity, and characters who are insanely quirky. Chris Elliot, as another reviewer pointed out, seems to have been ahead of his time. The style of comedy he honed on the Letterman show and the ""Get a Life"" sitcom was pure absurdist brilliance, and it shines through in this movie.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2019,Hey_Sweden,8," ""We're just here to catch fish and stink."" ""Mostly the latter.""
","After paying his dues working for David Letterman, and his subsequent stardom on the sitcom 'Get a Life', comedy veteran Chris Elliott made the leap to feature film starring status with this little epic. He plays Nathanial Mayweather, a well-bred ""fancy lad"". He's also an obnoxious, condescending p.o.s. who's in need of some serious life lessons. And he gets them when he ends up on the wrong sailing vessel, ""The Filthy Whore"". Mocked and humiliated by its ultra-crusty, tough-talking fishermen, he soon finds himself taken with this way of life.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2000,clurge-2,8," Quite enjoyable. Not as bad as everyone makes it out to be...
","When I was younger (a yearling of 14), Cabin Boy was just one of the movies you HAD to see. Along with Hot Shots, Hot Shots Part Deux, Loaded Weapon 1, Robin Hood: Men In Tights, and The Naked Gun Trilogy. A stupid little spoof filled with cheap gags, and even cheaper laughs. I think Cabin Boy may not be on the level of the previously mentioned heavy hitters in spoofs, but it steps to the plate and delivers just the same.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2006,planktonrules,2," just plain unfunny
","I had long been a fan of Chris Elliot up until I saw this film. I loved his tenure on THE David LETTERMAN SHOW (back when it was fresh and still funny)--his guy under the stairs and fugitive guy were cute little sketches. Then, when he went on to do GET A LIFE, I watched every episode--even that later ones that weren't quite as funny. So, because of my appreciation of his work, I had very high hopes for this movie. Then, I saw that a little Chris Elliot goes a very long way. A movie starring him just isn't all that funny--particularly one with no real laughs--just him behaving like an idiot. For five minutes or even 30 minutes, this is fine--but for an entire movie? It's like the absolute worst and unfunniest thing Elliot's ever done--stretched into movie length. SLOW and OVERBEARING--not funny at all.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2004,Money_is_Flesh,," not the worst movie of all time
","I've been a Chris Elliot fan since watching him on his old television series ""Get a Life."" I think he is the precursor to comedians such as Tom Green, and the modern gross-out comedy. The image of Elliot licking the boat with soapy water comes to mind. ",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2005,the-jerk,10," an epic in the grand tradition of ""Captain's Courageous""...
","""Cabin Boy"" is one of those movies that makes you glad to be alive. Chris Elliot shines in the role of Nathaniel Mayweather, a wealthy young man fresh out of finishing school, forced into a life at sea on a fishing boat with men not of his stature. Fine performances abound in this grand seafaring epic, including Brian Doyle-Murray as Skunk, Andy Richter as Kenny, Melora Walters as Trina, the swimmer who catches Nathaniel's heart, and Ann Magnuson as Calli, who cleans his pipes. Best of all is Ricki Lake with an astoundingly nuanced performance as The Filthy Whore's head. With rich cinematography, amazing special effects, and masterful direction by Adam Resnick (who also co-wrote the suspenseful and heartwarming screenplay with Elliot), this is one movie that you shouldn't miss if you're a fan of great seagoing adventure stories like ""The Odyssey"" and ""Captain's Courageous"". It's easily one of the greatest movies of this or any other generation; if I could rate higher than 10/10, I would do so with this one. The ending would make even the most hardened death row convict cry.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 1999,JohnSeal,3," One of the most witless comedies ever made
","What can I say? Every unfunny joke is hopelessly telegraphed and Chris Elliott needs to get over thinking he's the funniest thing since Ernie Kovacs. A good supporting cast battles valiantly against the script, but even such sure hands as Brion James, James Gammons and Russ Tamblyn can do nothing with it. Ann Magnuson's brief turn as Kali(for some reason spelled 'Calli' in the credits) is the only saving grace of this appalling waste of cellulose.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 1998,The One,7," A very weird, stupid, good movie...
","This movie is very strange... also very stupid... This makes it a very good movie... This is coming from someone who heard Letterman asking ""Would like to buy a monkey?"" on an ad, and deciding they HAD to see the rest... If you're like that - I recommend it. If your not - you'll probably think it's worse than ""Chicken Park"" ( Which is not possible ).",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw Cabin Boy when it first came out. At that time I had not yet developed the self- preserving habit of walking out of movies, so I sat to the bitter end. Humor is such a subjective thing that I can't scorn the people who had a good time at Cabin Boy. However, to me it was an endless succession of non sequiturs, poo-poo jokes, and generally low rent gags and special effects. I'm a huge fan of Bob (Elliott) and Ray from radio days, so I had great hope for Bob's son Chris. But Cabin Boy is an open and shut case for regression to the mean.",/review/rw0335306/?ref_=tt_urv
