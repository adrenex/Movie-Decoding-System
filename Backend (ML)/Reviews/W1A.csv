8 May 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10," Superb!
","I could not fault this movie whatsoever, and I am shocked at the low rating. The animation is jaw-dropping, especially in The Plagues scene, which is still for me visually and musically one of the most haunting and evocative scenes in an animated film, and the part with the Red Sea splitting. The songs and music(by Hans Zimmer) are phenomenal. ""When You Believe"" is a standout, as is the title song. People complained about the story. There is nothing wrong with the story at all, other that it is complicated, but it is a biblical story after all. The voice talents are superlative, here we have Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Jeff Goldblum, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Steve Martin and Martin Short voicing fairly complex and beautifully-drawn characters flawlessly. I tend to worry about A Listers in animated films, but this, people, is a truly talented voice cast, who are truly excellent when they are given a good script, which was exactly what they got. All in all, a superb animated film, which isn't to be missed. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",/review/rw8433279/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 1999,WeslyM,9," Spectacular re-telling of the Exodus
","For sheer spectacle, it's tough to beat the Bible.  With ""The Prince of Egypt,"" DreamWorks makes good on its promise to deliver a state-of-the-art animated film that will compete favorably with the best Disney has to offer. As with ""Antz,"" released earlier this year, DreamWorks has successfully resisted the temptation to populate this film with characters that can be turned into further revenue through toy sales.  (I do wonder, though, if three soundtrack albums--the film's soundtrack, an ""inspirational"" album, and a ""country"" album--were really necessary.)  The animation team has accomplished something truly spectacular; watching ""The Prince of Egypt"" is like seeing life breathed into a rich, luxurious tapestry.  The Biblical story told in the books of Genesis and Exodus is followed very faithfully, with only minor changes made for dramatic reasons.  The action sequences are truly exciting, overall pacing is excellent, and the miracles wrought by God are depicted with awed and respectful wonder.  One truly astonishing, harrowing sequence recounts the slaughter of firstborn Hebrew children by bringing hieroglyphic drawings to life on the walls of an Egyptian temple. The voice work is especially good--Val Kilmer is fine as Moses, and Pharoah, voiced by Ralph Fiennes, positively seethes with arrogance and hubris. The storytellers wisely chose to end their tale at the climactic crossing of the Red Sea; even the delivery of the Ten Commandments is portrayed only in an epilogue vignette.  (After all, the Israelites wander in the wilderness for forty years after that, and Moses ultimately is not allowed to enter the Promised Land--perhaps not the uplifting ending the filmmakers had in mind.) Some of the subject matter is dark and disturbing, and there is no shying away from the harsh realities of the original texts.  By all means, see it with the children in your life--and be prepared to discuss it with them afterward.",/review/rw8433279/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 1998,niteman,," Why are you sitting there when you could be seeing this film?
","Quite possibly the most astonishing achievement in animation since Beauty and the Beast (and surpassing same), The Prince of Egypt is a lovingly crafted, engaging piece of cinema.  The main characters are well-realized, three-dimensional characters.  The focus of the film is the conflict between Ramses and his adopted brother, Moses, set against the backdrop of the epic events in the book of Exodus.  The result is a religious tale that treats the oft-ignored human element.  Instead of merely relating the tale as it is, the story asks ""how would a person *feel* if God appeared to them and told them to do this?  How would others react?""  The script is light-years beyond any past biblical epic. The animation style owes a small debt to Disney's house style, but goes above and beyond in the details in character design (the Hebrews and Egyptians and Midians are clearly of different ethnic backgrounds, and no character suffers from the doe-eyed Disney Belle syndrome).   Computer Generated Imagery blends -- for the first time in an animated film -- seamlessly with traditional cel animation.  The film also takes some fairly audacious risks; Moses has a dream sequence in stiffly animated hieroglyphics, completely switching animation styles for about five minutes, which I believe is completely unprecedented in animation.  There are moments when the visual effects made me forget to breathe.  If you blink during the parting of the red sea, you'll regret it.  There is, I believe I can safely say, not a second of the film that does not offer some sort of visual delight -- from the deep symbolism of the hieroglyphics to the dizzying chariot race in the opening sequence. The music has been touted by some critics as the film's weak link; such is definitely not the case.  Stephen Schwartz' songs combine elements of Broadway-esque show tunes with native Hebrew and Egyptian music.  The songs are powerful and moving, sometimes no more than one verse in length, sometimes full-blown  seven-minute extravaganzas like ""Let My People Go."" The one weaker song, surprisingly, is the theme ""When You Believe.""  Even freed from Mariah Carey/Whitney Houston R&B cheese as it is in the movie, it's a watery definition of faith at best.  Still, the scene in which it takes place is powerful and the song is beautifully performed. If the film has a weak link, it might be the voice casting,Val Kilmer and Patrick Stewart in particular.  The two voices are distinctive of the gentleman who possess them, and thus are distracting in this format.  But such is a minor quibble, and should not dissuade anyone from seeing the greatest animated story ever told.",/review/rw8433279/?ref_=tt_urv

","I went to the movie theater to watch 'The Prince of Egypt' and the money I spent was very well used,because it is a great movie and one of my favorites from Dreamworks!(And look,I am not catholic or Jew) We have, in this great story, two brothers: one is Egyptian and with royal blood(Ramses),and the other one an orphan with a mysterious past(Moises). They are best friends and they have a great life in their palace,with strong bonds. But when Moises is so arrogant as his brother Ramses,but one night, when he was walking alone at night after searching for a woman(Tzipporah) Miriam and Aaron met with him and are surprised to see their little brother so close. Moises cannot believe that he is not royal and stays angry with Miriam, but stays in doubt after some while, and reading the walls of the pyramid, he discovers the true: that he has Jew blood and was adopted. Angry and thinking that everything he always imagined to be true were illusions, he run away and starts a new life as shepherd and even marrying Tzipporah. But now he has a new mission in his life(sent by God), that is to help his people (The Jews) to not be slaves anymore and go to the Promise Land. But he will need to confront his brother Ramses in this battle, and this will not be an easy thing...",/review/rw8433279/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2000,todd2u,," a true classic
","This is one of the best animated movie of all time. It's not every day that they make a animated movie about a story of the bible. The writers, and animators were very accurate about telling the story. As a Christian I like it when they make movies about the bible. The animation, and music was truly awesome. I like everything about this movie. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. Children will love this movie. I'll tell you now you wont be disappointed.

14 November 2018,ali_harkouss,10," Atheist but always astonished by this masterpiece
","Let's forget for a while religions and conflicts between humans. Let's focus on the huge amount of creativity and greatness that made this masterpiece. Although DreamWorks have imitated Disney on different levels but the result surprised all those who watched it. The title itself implies that a great story took place in an old great civilization.
In my opinion, the story of this movie is not like what most of people think: conflict between good and bad. It's way beyond that. It's a story of two real brothers who love each other to the core but they were obliged to become enemies due to their differences in beliefs and religion. Don't you think that it's time for people to forget about their differences and become compassionate and empathetic? Love will unite us while religions make us enemies to each other.
The music was outstanding, as well as the songs. The soundtracks of this film make the spectator live in old Egypt which is a very genius innovation by the composer. Very few composers know how to connect their music with an epoch, land and a place.
The first scene when slaves were building the pyramids was one of the best starts in movies history.
Simply it's one of the best movies in history. It's a combination of greatness and beauty.",/review/rw8433279/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 1999,Indy-52,10," the best animation ever...
","this movie, from Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks Pictures, is a great achievement in animated movies. It tells a story of biblical proportions (literally!) about slave Mozes' life as The Prince of Egypt, and does it in a great way. The animation is truly stunning, especially the scenes when Mozes splits up the Red Sea, and when he turns the Nile into blood (which was really kind of scary). I can't really recommend the whole family (including 7-year old kids) to go see this, but if you're over 12 years old and you know something about the story of Mozes, you'll definitely appreciate this film. I give it a 9.",/review/rw8433279/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2005,Localfreak,10," An Artistic Rendition of A great Tale
","The first time I saw this film I thought 'Wow! I have to own that!' The telling of the story of Moses is powerfully done and the art is outstanding. It is the soundtrack, however, that brings this beauty together- the songs as well as the musical scores are catchy, beautifully composed and thoroughly breathtaking. The story has not been 'dumbed down' or watered down. It is accessible to children without alienating other generations and it humanises the characters wonderfully. The only thing in the entire film I found difficult was the pronunciation of Aaron's name- but that is obviously minor, it just took me a while to 'get' if that makes sense.",/review/rw8433279/?ref_=tt_urv

I used a whole box of my Kleenex and my eyes were so red by the end of the movie I freaked out myself. Honestly, people should make more movies like this, because nowadays, it's all movies like where you forget what the movie is really about. And then couple of months later, you don't even remember if you watched the movie or not. I don't think that really makes sense there. But anyway this movie is really good!

3 January 2001,Arwyn,," Applause to Dreamworks for this beautiful tribute to Exodus.
","There is probably no greater literary classic than the Bible, and as such it is an obvious choice for Hollywood.  But why then are there so few attempts to bring the stories we grew up on to the Big Screen?  A very simple reason. In filming a Bible story, producers tread a very thin line.  They know they have to make the story interesting, the graphics new and innovative or the movie will flop.  But they cannot tamper too much with the original for fear of upsetting those who hold the story dear to their hearts.  Unbelievably, Hollywood has finally managed to tread that thin line in 'The Prince of Egypt'.  ",/review/rw8433279/?ref_=tt_urv

The story of Moses and the exodus, is already an epic story, and to see this movie reenact it, and meet every expectation I ever had, was glorious. This movie was the most expensive animated movie made during its time, with a large crew and cast of A listers all doing their part to breath life into this animated movie.

26 December 2020,SebMoz,10," The peak of animation
","Before DreamWorks became the commercialized company it is today, they tried making some 2D animated movies, as a ""take that"" to Disney and an attempt to build a studio capable of rivaling said Disney. Today, DreamWorks admittedly doesn't have nearly the same respect that Disney or Pixar does, but when they try their hardest, when they put all their effort into creating a movie which will stand the test of time no matter how changed the industry becomes, there is not a single other studio capable of rivaling their brilliance. And nowhere has this ever been showcased more clearly, than in The Prince of Egypt. This is probably the only animated movie I've ever seen, where I genuinly cannot find anything I don't like. This is a retelling of the biblical story of Moses, yet it works for anyone, even a natural sceptical person like me. DreamWorks managed to make a movie that can appeal to everyone, from deeply religious people to atheists. There's not a single line of dialogue in this movie that doesn't work, not a single shot that doesn't look good. The animation is so expressive and gorgeous, and the mix of borderline revolutionary 3D effects and 2D character models makes for some of the most breathtaking sequences I've ever seen. The incredible score and fenomenal songs make all that even better as well.",/review/rw8433279/?ref_=tt_urv
