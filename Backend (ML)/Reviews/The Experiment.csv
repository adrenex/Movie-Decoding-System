3 October 2015,Alcaminhante,10," There's still originality in Hollywood horror movies !!!? I'm scared !
",This was one of the rarest horror movies that managed to keep me totally scared and mostly uncomfortable from start to finish in years and years. I don't get this new trend of hating everything Shiamalan does. This new movie is one of the best horror concepts I've come across in a very long time and uses simplicity to the best effect. ,/review/rw3351480/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2015,Sleepin_Dragon,8," My heart sank. Great story.
","Now I am the first to admit you have to be in the mood for one of M Night Shyamalan's films. He intentionally tries to throw you off guard when you are watching one of hid films, you constantly question if all is as it should be, or quite simply is he messing with you.",/review/rw3351480/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2020,Muhammad_Rafeeq,8," Very Intence psychotic Disturbing Flim in its own way ( American C+Movie ) My Ratings 8/10
","This is Shayamalan's second film after the Last Airbender fiasco. It's a return to his light horror and small, contained story roots. The acting and script were good, and combined with the hand-held mockumentary conceit it felt very real. If you like Shayamalan movies and scary movies about crazy old people, give it a try.",/review/rw3351480/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2015,moviewizguy,8," M. Night is Back, Baby!
","It's hard to talk about any M. Night films these days without discussing his career trajectory, how he started off incredibly strong with a triple knockout of The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs, only to have his potential squandered, or at least questioned, with films like The Happening, The Last Airbender, and After Earth. As a fan of Shyamalan myself, even I had to admit that he may have lost his luster. With that being said, I'm overjoyed and elated to say that The Visit is Shyamalan's best film since The Village over 10 years ago (my personal favorite). And it's not so bad it's good. The Visit is a legitimately good film, with great performances, terrific setups and even better payoffs, and an overall simple but satisfying story, which is all Shyamalan needs right now.",/review/rw3351480/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2015,saarvardi,9," Better than it had any right to be!
","Even though I've been severely burned by M. Night Shyamalan's commercial misfires (or rather miscarriages) like Lady in the Lake (ugh!), Airbender (what the hell was he thinking?) and After Earth, I decided to give him one more shot in the shape of The Visit. What worked in his favor was his superb work on the small screen in the form of the 2015 mini-series Wayward Pines - which made me believe that deep down inside Shyamlan's heart still resides a true artist, and not some lazy hack who tackles big-budget flops just to get paychecks from the studio. His recent talk in interviews about gaining back artistic control of his products was another positive step in Shyamalan's long path to cinematic forgiveness.",/review/rw3351480/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2015,Matt_Layden,6," Could have done without the rapping.
","The big question on people's mind seems to be, is The Visit a return to form for the once promising director, M. Night Shyamalan. The answer is yes and no. While the film is leaps and bounds better than his last 4 previous efforts which include: the dreadful After Earth, the boring Last Airbender, the inane The Happening and the disappointing Lady in the Water, it fails to be anything more than another entry in a long list of horror found footage films. Yes, M. Night Shyamalan has fallen far my friends, so much that just his name on the screen invokes laughter and groans from the audience. He has to fall back and rely on an overused horror genre to bring some sort of credit to his tarnished legacy.",/review/rw3351480/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2015,CinemaClown,," A Good Shyamalan Film After A Long, Long Time!
","After having spent years squandering the studio money & garnering the wrath of film critics in his past few outings, M. Night Shyamalan takes a break from big-budget productions and decides to return to small-scale projects constrained by shoestring budget in an attempt to rediscover his creative side and with his latest feature, I'd say he has found it.",/review/rw3351480/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2015,Horst_In_Translation,8," Possessed? Insane? Or just old?
","Let us start with the plot of this 94-minute movie: A woman decides to go on a travel with her boyfriend, so she agrees to let her two children visit her estranged parents during her absence. The kids are off to the grandparents and the mother is off with her new boyfriend. Now this could be an actually harmonic time for everybody, but I got bad news: The writer and director is M. Night Shyamalan. If you know him, you know you will be seeing thriller and horror for the rest of the movie. And the fact that the kids are trying to make a connection between their mother and their grandparents again is the least dramatic thing waiting for you.",/review/rw3351480/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2015,jackbanister16,8," M. Night is making a comeback.
","I went into this movie knowing nothing about the film so when I saw, ""an M. Night Shyamalan film,"" I let out a frustrating sigh having been disappointed by him for years. This movie was different though. ",/review/rw3351480/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2015,ironhorse_iv,6," The Visit is kinda worth visiting. It was an alright movie for the most part.
","While, the movie isn't really that funny, or scary. This horror movie written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan was surprising, not that bad. It had the right amount of horror and comedy to make it, somewhat entertaining. The Visit proves once again, that this where Shyamalan belongs. After all, these are the genres that M. Night Shyamalan is known best for. It also helps that the movie was marketed as a small-budget independent film, rather than a huge money blockbuster. This allows, Shyamalan to work harder on the story asset, rather than focusing his time, on over-the-top visual effects. Unlike Shyamalan's recent films, there is an emotional depth to The Visit that is worth seeing, alone. The movie tells the story of contemporary grief/loss and how not to hold on to anger to your loves ones, because you don't know if you'll ever get a chance to forgive/reconcile with them. It's a very strong message that anybody can related to. I really did get invested in the story of a family is trying to recovered, from a recent divorce. Hoping to give their mother, Paula Jamison (Kathryn Hahn) a well-needed vacation with her new boyfriend; two young kids, Thirteen-year-old Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) and 15-year-old Rebecca (Olivia DeJonge) agree to spend a week with their grandparents, even though, they never met them. At first, their ""Nana"" (Deanna Dunagan) and ""Pop Pop"" (Peter McRobbie), seem fine, but things started to unravel, when night falls. Can the kids survive their week with them, or will something deadly happen? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this movie is clearly not a 'found-footage' movie, like some critics label it. It doesn't have, that raw factor that many found-footage movie, has. First off, the camera visual style isn't that amateurism. There wasn't a lot of blurry shots, shaking cam, or pitch darkness shots. Thank God! I like that the movie was mostly well-shot. Shyamalan uses the style with more creativity than most other filmmakers, displaying his unique visual motif. Some great examples are his use of reflected images for dramatic and thematic effect. Others are his use of intimacy long-takes and how he creates a Mise en scène. Plus, the movie, zig-zagged, heavily, from traditionally In-Universe storytelling camera shots to hand-held. It's felt more Cinéma vérité, with bits of documentary style. It's really hard to bypass this as 'realistic found-footage' movie, when there are credits & day title cards, being shown, throughout the film. It's a bit jarring to see that. However, I get, why it's filmed on a hand-held camera. There is in universe reason for this. It was film, this way, because Rebecca is an aspiring, documentary filmmaker with a big heart. Rebecca wants to document the whole thing as a form of therapy for her mum, whose reasons for the bad blood with her parents remain a tightly-kept secret. The characters themselves are even aware of certain cinematic theories that could make their ""documentary"" more interesting. They're refreshingly intelligent and self-aware, and they never blunder stupidly into any situation. I also love the straight-to-camera confessions scenes. You really get to see, their desires and anxieties through it. Using this, Shyamalan was able to show, a large range of emotional, within his actors. In my opinion, most of the actors give great performances. The child actors were very likable. The grandparent are downright creepy. However, there were a few things that didn't work for me. I really didn't like how the film establish the kid's phobias. It wasn't use, right. I really don't get, how Becca is afraid of looking at herself on camera, but she's okay, at looking at herself, on Skype. Another thing, why Tyler is afraid of germs, yet, he's willing to play hide and seek, under the dirty stairs. It doesn't make sense. For the grandparents. I really didn't like Grandma's over the top, ""alien"" theory. Remind me, too much of his previous awful films, 2006's Lady and the Water, and 2002's Signs. Her jump scares and suicide attempts were also pretty lame. It seem, more silly than disturbing. I also didn't like, the poop or cleaning the gun jokes for the Grandpa. It really seem way too cartoony and fell really flat. Nevertheless, I still like their Yahtzee scene. By far, the best part of the film. Some of the grandfather's dialogue, is kinda choppy, and unrealistic in tone, too. The film has also been criticized for its use of dementia equals violent, approach, by other critics; but in my opinion, I just glad, it wasn't cause, by, anything supernatural. Overall: I came into this movie with very low expectations. After all, it's been a while, since director M. Night Shyamalan made an alright movie. While, this movie isn't bad, it wasn't really good. It was pretty mediocre. As much as people might hate him, in my opinion, Shyamalan is a filmmaker whom somewhat deserve a comeback. Hopefully, his next movie will be a masterpiece. Sadly, this movie wasn't it",/review/rw3351480/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2022,MJB784,6," She should've shown them a photo
","It started out good, but the movie wasn't scary and the twist doesn't add up. For example: If they aren't the grandparents, wouldn't they see a photo of them from their mom before visiting? Besides, how did they escape the asylum and what does that have to do with not leaving the room at 9:30?",/review/rw3351480/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2015,homdeb1058,5," Wait am I in the Right Theater?
","The thing I found out (to my dismay) that I did not know before going to the theater was that a lot of this movie was shot in the long over-used and abused ""home movie/shaky cam"" format. If I had come in the theater in the middle of the movie, I might have assumed I had accidentally wandered into the 7th, or whatever, sequel to Paranormal Activity. And to add insult to injury M Night is about 8 years late to the party for that trick. Or was it suppose to be some type of irony or mocking of the standard horror movie fare? Perhaps this once creative director has finally succumbed to audience expectations --if all you want is cookie cutter, unimaginative, thematically barren, shaky cam, scary movies then here you go......

23 January 2016,jennifer626,6," Flawed but entertaining
","Shyamalan has suffered like few other directors as a result of his later films not measuring up to the exacting standards set by The Sixth Sense and Signs. Part of this is self-inflicted, because he has refused to veer from the""M. Night Shyamalan"" formula: modern fairy tale crafted to take an unexpected turn approximately two-thirds into the fun. When the twist fails to impress or the fairy tale is dull, the movie disappoints audiences on on two levels. Not only is the movie judged mediocre, but it is criticized for failing to deliver on the promise made by Shyamalan's earlier efforts.",/review/rw3351480/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2015,chicagopoetry,2," More Crap From The Crap Master
","M. Night Sham is back and as lousy as ever. Presenting the one director most famous for living his career in reverse. His great masterpiece was his first movie and it has been nothing but downhill from there. Each film gets worse and worse. And believe it or not, in an attempt to make a big comeback, he resorts to the found footage genre, the cheapest, sleaziest and laziest genre in existence today (sometimes I wish Blair Witch Project was never made so I didn't have to suffer through one of these lousy movies after another). This film might have been something where we saw some promise if it was some director's first attempt, but it's not, it's freaking' M. Night Sham's umpteenth freaking' film and so it's a pile of garbage. The big surprise twist is obvious from about twenty minutes into the film and from then on it's just another stupid found footage film. This could have been a pretty scary film if it WASN'T in the found footage genre. The found footage concept detracts from everything as we wonder, who is still filming? why is the camera still filming? how convenient that the camera fell to the ground and is still filming at such a great angle. Blah blah freaking' blah blah blah like EVERY other found footage film ever made. Too lazy to actually make a film, well then, resort to found footage. The crappy cinematography can be blamed on the concept. Yeah, M. Night Sham is back alright, back to the same old crapola.",/review/rw3351480/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2015,mm-39,5," Disappointment!
","Disappointment! The Visit breaks down into two concepts: what worked and what did not. What did not work: Another Blair Witch documentary style horror film! Shaky camera amateurish look with over long narration just like all the fake documentary genre horror films. The Visit comes across as self-absorbed and amateurish which annoys the viewer, and gets old fast. A granddaughter wants to meet her estranged grandparents which creates a stretched out boring personal narration, which adds little to the story line. The estranged grandparents exhibit clinical behaviors of paranoid schizophrenia and dementia, which becomes hard to watch. What worked: The plot twist where the mom lets the kids know via skype ""that's not my parents"". The end is tension filled of how will the children escape. The protagonist finds out the grandparents were murdered, and that the grandparents volunteered at the institute was not a great idea. Strong conclusions for a painful to watch story. Shyamalan (writer/director) has great concepts, plot twists, but regrettably Shyamalan's movies become bogged down in deep details which do not translate from word to film well. 5 out of 10.",/review/rw3351480/?ref_=tt_urv

One day, their grandparents invite them to spend a week in their farm and they accept the invitation to let their mother travel alone with her boyfriend. Becca decides to make a documentary of their visit and Tyler and she are welcomed by their grandparents.

1 February 2017,TheLittleSongbird,5," The odd and creepy, the very odd and creepy and 'The Visit'
","M Night Shyamalan is one inconsistent director, with films that have fallen on both extreme sides of the film spectrum. The great films being 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' and the terrible films (especially) being 'The Last Airbender', 'The Happening' and 'After Earth'. It was frustrating to see a director start so promisingly and fall downhill and showing few signs of learning from his mistakes.",/review/rw3351480/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2015,emansmoviereviews,7," Disturbingly funny and interesting movie
","The Good: The most surprising thing about this movie was how it uniquely found a way to be scary, but still include funny moments throughout the film. It knew when to be funny, and when to be scary, without mixing the two together. The scary parts will provide quite a few jump- scares, and in some scenes they will simply disturb you. The young boy, ""Tyler"" (played by Ed Oxenbould ), will quickly become a favorite in this film with his various remarks, ""swearing"", and ""skills"". I think it's fair to say that ""Nana"", played by Deanna Dunagan, does a really good job of playing the crazy grandma given all the versatile things she did in the movie. For some, the plot twist in the story will be mild, but good nevertheless.",/review/rw3351480/?ref_=tt_urv

","The first thing I'll say about this film it that it is truly terrifying. I screamed out loud several times and on more than one occasion I contemplated getting up and leaving the theater so that I wouldn't have to endure yet another image to send my heart into my throat. I did, however, stay through the entire film to watch the madness unfold.

5 June 2017,bowmanblue,4," Visitation rights revoked
","I'll pretty much watch any old horror film. It's a definite fault in mine. So I sat down to watch 'The Visit' based on the fact that it was new and looked a bit spooky, judging by the front cover (yes, I do know the old saying about never judging a book by its cover, but I still do!). Now, apart from knowing that it was a horror movie, I learned two other majorly important facts in the opening couple of scenes. The first of which that it was partly made by M Night Shyamalan and, if you don't know, made those classic films 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' around the year 2000. And, since then, his film-making record has been a little patchy (to put it politely!). Secondly, this is a 'found footage' film. And, if you don't know what that is then you obviously don't watch enough modern horror.",/review/rw3351480/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2016,lavatch,4," Subpar Thriller from M. Night Shyamalan
","The films of M. Night Shyamalan are characterized by gimmicks. In his finest effort in ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999), the conceit of the film was that of a man in limbo between the world of the dead and the living that ultimately comes as a surprise to the audience. But the film was compelling because of the relationship of the psychiatrist and the young boy.",/review/rw3351480/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2020,robertemerald,6," Limited moments of terror toward the end
","The whole idea for The Visit was pretty good, but the terrifying secret had to be revealed much sooner than in the second to last chapter (after at least six other chapters). And, had the terror been introduced in say, the third chapter, the filmmaker had to be prepared to come up with some sort of evolving torture, tension or chase, in order to keep us entertained for the rest of the picture, as is the case with many excellent home invasion movies. In a way I feel that this Director has only had half an idea for a movie, but he came up with another idea of how he could make half an idea work as a whole movie. That second idea is both the half-genius, and half-failure for this movie, and seems to involve framing the footage as a school documentary project, like Blair Witch (1999), only he's wise enough to avoid the camera shake and involve two cameras plus a computer, and a dash of good photography here and there. For me, however, the premise is dubious. The original premise, that an increasing demented and rapidly ageing couple first murder their companions, another old couple, then send for the grandchildren of the murdered couple (who have never met them). They start living in the murdered couple's big old house, assuming, with quite a sprinkle of public dotage, their identities. So far gone are these two oldies that they continue to struggle with their dementia even after the kids arrive. Obviously when the kids finally realise the couple are not their grandparents that's when the fun, belatedly, arrives. I get it. Terrifying. Thing is, the old couple are so demented that they easily bungle their attempt to kill the children. In any case, they must have known the gig was up should two innocent and much loved children disappear. I guess that's the point of the movie. Old people with dementia don't have logic. If this is a movie about dementia then it's in poor taste. If it's a quirky horror oddity, which I think is what the Director must have been aiming for, then it is moderately successful. But it's not all that scary, just odd, for most of the movie. Strangely, the false grandma tells a tale one day of aliens that infect drinking water, which allows them to incapacitate their human victims, keeping them alive but comatose and hidden at the bottom of a lake, ready for delivery back to their home planet. For a while I was waiting to see the alien hosts that must be causing all this illogical, sorry, demented, madness, you know, like that movie I Am Not A Serial Killer (2016). Alas, in the end, despite an alternate ending on the dvd, they never did actually appear.",/review/rw3351480/?ref_=tt_urv
