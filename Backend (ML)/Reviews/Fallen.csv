18 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,9," Tom Hiddleston is great as Loki!
",Loki is a must watch for any Marvel fan! I'm a huge fan of Marvel and other superhero shows/movies so I may be a little biased but this is one of favorites series from the MCU. It's an action packed thriller from start to finish. This show will grab you and pull you into its world from the very first episode. You'll have so much fun watching this show that before you know it you'll have binged the entire season. Every episode is incredibly written. It had such high expectations and not only met those expectations but surpassed them. There's really nothing else I can say about this show that hasn't already been said. I'm glad they renewed for a second season because this show deserves it.,/review/rw8642806/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,9," Great Addition to the MCU!
","Loki was even better than I thought it would be and is easily one of the best Marvel series to date! If you didn't like this then it's probably because you didn't want to like it and just not a fan of Marvel otherwise what were you expecting that you didn't get? Did you not see the trailer or know the history of the character? Besides Thanos, Loki is easily the next best villain/antihero in the MCU! What more can be said about Tom Hiddleston that hasn't already been said? He's such an underrated actor and his best work has come as Loki. Also, this is one of the best performances of Owen Wilson's career, he is just fantastic in it! I really can not recommend this incredible series enough!",/review/rw8642806/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,HafizhMaulana21,9," An outstanding performance series
","After escaping from the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", Loki is now captured by the time authorities to maintain a predetermined timeline.",/review/rw8642806/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2022,jediwalker-49827,6," Pretty good
",My dad really liked this show and I think it was OK but it should've been a movie I think it would've been better as a movie but overall a good show Loki's a good villain.,/review/rw8642806/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2022,strabgerthings,8," Loki - The Best MCU Show So Far
","Loki exceeded my expectations in almost every way. The Cinematography is breathtaking, the tone is almost claustrophobic and intriguing, and the music by Natalie Holt is just something else. The only complaints I have about this show are nitpicks at best and don't really mean anything. Tom Hiddleston is great as Loki, and his and Owen Wilson's chemistry is on another level. This show is just so creative with it's concepts but it also manages to execute them well, unlike some other projects in phase four. Every episode feels so different in a good way which makes going into a new episode fun and interesting as you know you'll be getting something new a different. Unlike the other MCU shows, Loki's finale is not dissapointing in the slightest. I would even argue it's the best part of the show as it showcases some great performances and has real MCU reprecussions. I don't think this show could have been done any better than it was. Very excited for season 2.",/review/rw8642806/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2022,ThereelscoopwithKK,9," Love it
","After the first episode I was unsure of whether I'd like it or not, but it grew on me every episode. Owen Wilson and Tom Hiddleston are absolutely fantastic together. The character development in this series is exceptional , particularly for Marvel. There are even character arcs of some of the background TVA workers that have you interested. The TVA itself with its quirks and twists was really well done.",/review/rw8642806/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2022,tylerdburns-81322,9," Huge Implications for the MCU
","The thirty seventh entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Loki is a groundbreaking show. The casting as per usual, is simply perfect. The special effects are spectacular. The story itself is completely unpredictable, and not at all what I imagined I'd be watching. I can not stress enough how much world building and character changing for the MCU occurs in this show. The implications for the MCU at large are huge, as well as setting up the next saga after the three previous phases. Loki and Sylvie are a very unique couple, and though it will come off as ""icky"" if you dwell on it too long, it definitely still works, and very much feels as someone Loki would be interested in. Also an interesting thing to note about the show is the fact that there is no real villain. All together, this show is one of my favorite entries into the MCU.",/review/rw8642806/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,Reviews_of_the_Dead,7," Fun Time Filler Show
","This is a Marvel show that I thought sounded interesting. I debated watching it. What was the deciding factor was that I saw what happens in this show is considered canon for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I also watched this while feeding my newborn daughter so it gave me something to do while doing that: two birds, one stone.",/review/rw8642806/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,bucksbasketball,10," The best of all the Marvel shows
","This is easily one of the best Marvel shows Disney made. I like them all but this is probably my favorite of the bunch. Tom Hiddleston and Owen Wilson have great chemistry together. I don't even know how to explain how much I love this show, every episode is fantastic! I wasn't sure how much I was going to like this after reading the mixed reviews but most of the negative reviews are coming from people who hate everything about Marvel and hate it without watching a second of it. It's original, creative and really just a fantastic show across the board. The only thing I can say is: Watch. This. Show. You will not regret it.",/review/rw8642806/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2023,breedenjack,9," Cannot wait for season 2

31 July 2022,toseale,8," We Wanted More Loki and Got Something Great
","Following unexpected events in Endgame, Loki is a great introduction to who can be in the multiverse. Each varient of his is fun and exciting, putting a different spin on the character. Tom Hiddleston just seems to be having fun playing his character, and the show leaves plenty to be excited (and honestly terrified) for. The show has plenty of wild moments, really giving a twisted view on the MCU and what lies outside of its respective universe. Hopefully season 2 will be just as rewarding and intense.",/review/rw8642806/?ref_=tt_urv

16 July 2021,ThomDerd,8," Just because of episode 5 & 6 it's OK.

24 July 2022,alekspredator87,8," The God of Deception opens up new worlds
","Loki is one of the most charismatic and memorable characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Several appearances of the God of Deception in Kevin Feige's projects allowed the character to fully reveal himself, turn from a villain into a kind of antihero who clings with charisma, smile and actions. In my opinion, Alexander Gavrilin's dubbing played an important role for the Russian-speaking space. The voice of the actor is now firmly associated with me and many with the character of Tom Hiddleston.",/review/rw8642806/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2021,FeastMode,9," Glorious
",I thought both Wandavision and Falcon/Winter reached 8-star levels during the season (8 stars = amazing). But neither concluded as strongly as I would've liked and I ended up giving them 7s (7 stars = awesome).,/review/rw8642806/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2022,bretttaylor-04022,8," Loki should have had his own film by now
",I thought this was good overall but I am worried where it is leading. I think as soon as you start bringing alternative Universes and time travel as part of an ongoing and seemingly never ending series first time and casual viewers fail to grasp what is going on.,/review/rw8642806/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2022,kieran-shepherd-horatio,8," A top watch
","Loki + time travel.. I was intrigued, but the first episode got me hooked in right from the musical score and the opening sequence to the styling, dark and uncaring inter spliced with 80s informercials - something along the lines of Portal.",/review/rw8642806/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2021,akshayjv-05222,9," Marvel's best series
","Loki is completely different from other superhero series. It has an good story ,cast and execution. The story is twisted like dark and it will blow your mind away. It is definitely a must watch show if you are following marvel movies.",/review/rw8642806/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2022,kroviofthedead,9," Best Disney plus show so far
",Loki season one for me showed me that the marvel multiverse can be amazing with beautiful shots (beginning of episode 6 ) and show in episode 5 variants of loki which was in more detail in spiderman no way home and multiverse of madness and shown us kang the conquer.,/review/rw8642806/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2022,chrisrs123,9," Surprising breakout success of Phase 4
",My initial distaste for Loki is that it should not exist. Thanos finally killed off Loki and literally looked down the camera to say no resurrections this time. Bringing him back for a spin off would be ridiculous and undermine any credibility the MCU has left with consequences and destroy any chance of ever taking anything they do with Loki seriously again. It would just be pandering to Hiddleston fangirls at the cost of the narrative. I already feel Loki has had too much attention just because Hiddleston is pretty.,/review/rw8642806/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2022,slywlf54,9," Entertaining and enjoyable
","I had really been looking forward to this series, and on the whole it doesn't disappoint. This Loki variant is just enough different than the main timeline character to offer Tom Hiddleston a bit of leeway in the performance, which he took up in as grand a style as they allowed him. The only reason for one dropped star is that they continue to use him as a punching bag entirely too much, and reduced his magic and fighting skills to not much better than a mere mortal, which does the character no justice. I also really enjoyed Sylvie and their budding relationship, however awkward it has been so far.",/review/rw8642806/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,nikitap-42222,8," Amazing series
",This series had a lot to offer me because of the character Loki was offering he had a very deep character he had this realisation of what he had done in the past and he tried his best to undo everything and fix everything what he had done his efforts made him very lovable at this point the transformation in loki was very fascinating he transformed himself into a very different character and it is very hard for me to believe that someone can change at this point he had made himself totally different person and during his journey he had a lot to experience so make sure you watch this with a lot of expectations and this is an amazing series.,/review/rw8642806/?ref_=tt_urv
