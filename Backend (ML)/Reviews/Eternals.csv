","I've read several critical reviews applauding this film, however having sat through it twice I have to point out that this is a very poor film.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2021,cricketbat,4," Watching this movie felt like an eternity
","Shang-Chi gave me hope for Phase 4 of Marvel. Eternals dashed those hopes. This is probably my least favorite Marvel movie. This film is too long and crammed full of overly complicated plot points, yet it's also completely predictable. It seems the filmmakers were too busy trying to check off boxes rather than create a good story. It's also a downer. People watch MCU movies to have fun, not to have existential crises. Perhaps the Eternals should have stood on the sidelines a little longer.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,paul_haakonsen,3," Fairly shallow Marvel experience...
","Another year, another Marvel Studios superhero movie, right? Well, so it would seem. I had only vaguely heard about ""Eternals"" prior to sitting down to watch it. But then again, superhero movies isn't exactly my primary go-to-movie choice. But yeah, I do watch them if given the chance, as Marvel Studios does churn out movies that are fun enough if for nothing else then for the amazing CGI.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,SnoopyStyle,5," hard to connect
","The Eternals are immortals created to eliminate the destructive Deviants. 7000 years ago, ten Eternals were sent to Earth. They were able to eliminate the last Deviant 500 years ago and have been waiting to go home ever since.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2021,view_and_review,5," Eternal was the Runtime
","I'm not going to give a long winded review though the movie was long. ""Eternal"" was the runtime. There were parts that were good and parts that weren't. One of the biggest issues is that a movie of this nature presents more questions than it answers. The very existence of eternal beings existing on planet Earth, sent there by their creator in order to protect human life from Deviants, begs a lot of questions. And the more they strayed from their prime directive, the more questions they presented. The eternals were human in every aspect with the exception of their powers and their lifespan. The fact that such humanlike and very fallible beings (as in not entirely obedient) were sent to protect humans is just a start of the questions.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2022,Neptune165,2," Definitely my #1 Worst Movie of the Year!
","Ok but how are they speaking english since they are before the time when english language was spoken? I was extremely disappointed with this movie. The amount of plot holes and wasted potential was really annoying and Sersei had 0 personality. The visuals were amazing but it doesn't make up for the lack of logic put into the movie. The powers were so inconsistent and the prime eternal was just wasted after not even putting up a fight. The deviants were wasted as well and the celestials not telling the eternals why they're on the planet made no sense. Just so many reasons to dislike the execution of the movie. This was a lame movie, there is always a useless hero in every show and Thena was this movies useless hero... How tf you let your man die right in front of you. Thanos IS a Deviant-Eternal. So where's the logic. This movie was completely overrated i'm sorry. This film was the worst mcu film. So boring and the plot was all over the place.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,CinemaClown,," Neither Intrigues Nor Entertains
","The 26th instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe marks the arrival of a new brand of superheroes into their ever-growing family and further expands the horizons of its shared universe with its grand scope. However, being one of the lesser-known properties the way Guardians was back in 2014, Eternals needed to create an intrigue & curiosity to make us care & invest in its mythic world but the film as a whole simply falls flat at it.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2021,FeastMode,5," i'm so sad
","I went in knowing nothing about the source material and not watching a single trailer. I had no expectations for this movie. After watching it, I feel like it had the potential to be incredible. But it wasn't. It wasn't even good. I'm legitimately sad while writing this.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,educallejero,1," Horrible
","Trying to be ""deep"", the director uses some long shots (or longer than usual in the MCU) here and there, less frenetic editing here and there, and less Marvel humor (there is enough though), in a thing that turned to be a really, really bad experiment. Valient effort though?",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2021,Johnny_West,1," Eternals boring just like the Inhumans
","A couple of years ago, there was The Inhumans mini-series, featuring superheroes who lived on the Moon, but were supposedly protecting Earth. Now the Eternals are doing the same thing, with a similar cast of superheroes.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2021,Sir_AmirSyarif,6," Magnificent to look but it's pretty much lifeless with boring actors playing boring characters
","Chlo√© Zhao's direction gives Marvel Cinematic Universe a much needed breath of fresh air, but 'Eternals' doesn't quite come together. Despite the fact the film claims to have a far more thought-provoking theme and a plethora of philosophical concepts, it fails to elaborate on them sufficiently to create a more compelling experience. The movie is still magnificent to look but it's pretty much lifeless with boring actors playing boring characters.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2021,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,4," Definitely the MCU's weakest movie
","Eternals had the potential to be a real standout film from the crowd, but it missed out on breaking ranks from its franchise's long-held cliches like 'action scene then funny one-liner' moments that don't feel like character moments anymore, but 'creative mandates' imposed by the studio.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2022,Rob-O-Cop,4," Watching people who mostly can't die (eternals) fight each other can be boring
","This review has been declined 3 times now. I don't know why, I think it's cos of the real name of Gilgamesh coinciding with an english word.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,judywalker2,2," Most boring supers ever
","I can understand Marvel wanting to expand its universe; all you have to do is look at the dollars to understand it. But, the thing about superheroes, they have to be super beyond their powers. I didn't know anything about these characters and frankly after watching this movie I don't want to know anymore. I thought Justice league and Batman versus Superman were bad. But nothing has been as boring as this movie. It's cheesy and preachy with no interesting characters except Sprite and the Deviant. I think they may need to stop cause superhero overload can cause bad movie making decisions.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,trashgang,4," one boring trip, I stopped after one hour
","And then magic happened, Eternals on Disney streaming. Another entry in the Marvel world. And have seen enough trailers I was ready for it, it looked great but...",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,Neptune165,2," It just feels like an unnecessary movie
","The whole plot was terrible . They focused all the attention for almost 2 hours on the deviance and all of a sudden it turns out they're not the bad guys after all let's focus 30 minutes of the rest of the movie on someone else.. Marvel failed a great cast with a terrible script. Marvel should separate Eternals film into 2 Parts to have more progressive storyline and deep dive on characterization and the build up of motivation to save the Earth with balanced action sequences and dramas in between... Eternals Book 1 and Eternals Book 2. Just like what Warner did on Dune film.. or Avengers 3 and 4. Worst movie I've seen in years!!!! Worst MCU movie. Hardly any character development, no reason to care about the characters. Outside if him, the comedy was lackluster. Pace was off. Most performances by the actors were good but their stories were not deep enough, hard to do with that many protagonists in one movie. My first thought was why do the people already have british and scottish accent even before they arrive on earth? Like it would make sense if they all spoke similar english when they first arrive on Earth but when they later end up separating and going their own ways they end up developing their british and scottish accent or whatever. Maybe I'm nitpicking it too much but it was literally the first scene in the movie that just broke my immersion immediately.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2021,blanbrn,4," Long drawn out superhero film that spans time and ages!
","Not the greatest ""Marvel"" movie fan yet I gave ""Eternals"" a try even though never really hearing about it or reading the comics, and was not real impressed as the movie went back and fourth thru the ages and time as the group of Eternals were always fighting evil and the movie was a showcase of love and family like feel. It was an eye candy watch for seeing the hot and sexy Gemma Chan and Salma Hayek as immortals Sersi and Ajak as both were healers and watchers of the group. Overall my interest came and went the film for one was to long and drawn out as the message could have been shorter. Still I guess a watch if your a Marvel movie fan, and the look of Gemma Chan and Salma Hayek as superheroes was sexy and impressive.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2022,WeAreLive,2," Worst MCU film ever
","Following the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), an unexpected tragedy forces the Eternals, ancient aliens who have been living on Earth in secret for thousands of years, out of the shadows to reunite against mankind's most ancient enemy, the Deviants.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2021,thesar-2,4," Hope This Timeline Isn't Eternal
","This was almost a dead-even 5/10 star film, but the more I think about it, the less I like it. I HAAAATED some of the incredibly cheap looking CGI. Sure, SOME of it was good, but our main villains, the devil-alien dogs were laughably fake looking and the 1st post-credit scene had this small ""creature"" who was about on par with Super Nintendo graphics. Also, only some of the humor landed, but most felt forced. I did LOVE all the diversity and acting - each actor really tried their best. The plot is okay, but it did drag and shoot, am I tired of hearing excuses when MCU introduces new Super-Human characters who were around for wars, including the Infinity War, and did nothing to help/prevent it. Either you need to reboot everything or make origin stories set in present day only. Finally, I 100% hated the inclusion of a particular reference in regards to comparing the lead male Eternal, Ikaris to another superhero.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2022,Neptune165,2," Easily one of the worst movies I've seen this year tbh
","I am not really impressed this Eternals movie .. looks like amature superpower. Boring fight scenes & not really advantures . Well, overall it still can be watch to the end of this movie . 4/10. This film is actually not fiction at all. Worst film ever it's unbelievably terrible. Im shocked how marvel made this crap, bad acting and even worse story line . Powers are as if a school kid thought them up. Pissed !!! Do not waste your money buying it. That was the most boring Marvel movie ive ever watched! The entire movie is huge plot hole. So Celestials need to seed intelligent life to birth their kind but stood by somehow as Thanos wiped out half of life, then came back to completely wipe out the other half and all of existence? I really want to like this movie but it just didn't really work for me. Really feel like this needed to be a miniseries or spread out across multiple movies. Just too much stuff crammed into a 2 hour period. Didn't give me enough time to care about the characters/story that much, and the wonky pacing and acting didn't help with that either. I don't hate the movie, but could've been so much better.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2022,justin-marshall5,7," I don't understand the hate
","Not really sure why this movie got so much hate. It's introducing a swath of new superhero's and doesn't really converge with any other Avengers plot lines save for a few mentions of Thanos, Thor and some other hero's. That job on its own isn't an easy one and I think they did a fantastic job of giving us a new storyline. The shear scale of the movie was well done both in terms of time periods and in general how epic and massive everything felt. Loved the diversity of the characters - every one of them added something to the story. With that being said - and this is coming from just your average Marvel fan with no knowledge of the comics - the Eternals powers all seemed a bit underwhelming. Maybe it's just that they were trying to display how powerful the deviants were but even Ikaris couldn't take down one on his own. Other than that the movie was absolutely beautifully shot - maybe the best looking Marvel movie to date. Again, I'm not sure what the hate is about but I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,Neptune165,2," Won't watch again
","This movie felt like 3 movies supercut into one. Pacing was all over the place. Seems a stretch for me to call most of these characters ""super-heroes,"" most seemed remarkably pathetic in their abilities, some of these ""Eternals"" were so easily killed, yet some inexplicably were tanks. Humor was very weak; the best lines were from the trailer and most of those were cringey. Kit Harrington was wasted. Angelina Jolie was wasted. All the major plot points were just exposition vomit or were so obviously telegraphed. I was never so conflicted in a post-credit scene. On one hand I was grateful for this dreadful movie to be over, and then sacked with absolute apathy that the Eternals ""will return...."" I hope not. I was just so so disappointed, wanted to cry this movie frustrates me sm, lore was thrown out the window, it didnt even seem like the eternals (besides the fast girl) could even fight. I was looking forward for this movie to demonstrate how this era of marvel movies is supposed to be on such a vast scale, no longer being about earth alone but the multiverses.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,Gordon-11,," Spectacular visuals, but
","The visuals of ""Eternals"" are spectacular. They look very real and very stylish. I also applaud the film for the diversity of the cast. However, the build up of the film is just too slow and too long, and I lost most of my interest and concentration when the final showdown begins. In addition, the one liner jokes are a little out of place and quite contrived. It is still an entertaining film, but probably not as great as the recent Marvel films.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,gareth-75442,2," Another marmite movie from Disney
","Some will love it some will hate it, whichever category you're in you're lying out your back teeth saying this is either the worst or best MCU movie, at best this movie is a 5, at its worst its a 2,I've opted for the latter simply because this movie fails at pretty much everything it attempts:
story; lacklustre.",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2021,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,4," A bit too... much.
","The Eternals tries breaking MCU ranks whilst suffering from sequel-teasing and not enough narrative breathing room to let the screenplay really shine through the film's many inconsistencies (be it Icarus' arc and the logic of the alien-super-race as the antagonists). This film claims to be more diverse than the rest of the canon, but it's more of the same action-then-punchline stuff some weary viewers just can't shake off any longer. The formula's starting to show its cracks and can't be used to introduce characters for uninitiated viewers like they did with The Avengers or Spider-Man (characters we now have collective knowledge on).",/review/rw7590915/?ref_=tt_urv
