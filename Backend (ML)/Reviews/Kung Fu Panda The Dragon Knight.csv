28 December 2019,emiliecunning-21094,10," STILL the BEST version
","I have read the book and watched this version 8+ times, I love it so dearly, it is one of my favourite films of all time. I just watched Greta Gerwig's 2019 version and appreciated a lot of the performances and certain elements of it, yet it simply cannot hold a candle to this 1994 version. This one just has far more heart, warmth and loveliness to it - it always leaves me feeling cosy and warm inside and I always cry when Beth dies (Claire Danes is so fantastic in that scene). I just generally prefer this version in many ways: the linear storytelling, the two different Amys (which makes way more sense than these other adaptions which have one Amy), the aesthetic, the music, the performances. If you want to see a definitive adaptation of Little Women, this is it.",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2002,mercybell,10," ""Little Women"" in it's own right
","Though some may argue that the older classic versions of Little Women with Katherine Hepburn and June Allison may be better because it sticks to the book, this is the only version that captures the spirit of the book.",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2005,IridescentTranquility,9," Something that should be treasured
","There are many, many reasons why I love this version of Little Women. The main one - or at least the most immediate - is the way the film looks. I love the soft lighting, the hair and costumes (I was astounded this year when I bought the DVD to hear on the commentary that Winona Ryder's hair was not her own but a wig! I never would have guessed it at all.) The male characters as much as the females, I do love the period costumes, and I'm impressed by the efforts the wardrobe department made to get everything so accurate. The girls were in impoverished circumstances, so the clothes they wear aren't new and look just as though they've been handed down from one sister to another. ",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2007,ccthemovieman-1,10," Watching This Yields 'Rich' Results - A Wonderful Re-Make
","""Rich"" is the word I would best use to describe this movie. It's rich  in cinematography with gorgeous scenery and interiors; rich in  characters with all good-hearted men and women of character; rich in  love for each whether its for family or for suitors and rich in  storytelling.  Yes, it's definitely more of a woman's movie than a man's, and not the  sort of thing I would normally enjoy, but this movie was so well-done  that I cannot say anything negative about it. In the modern-era of  film-making (late '60s to today), it is always a pleasure to see a  totally clean and nice movie.  The cast is excellent. It's nice to see Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon  play ""wholesome"" roles, something they don't always do, but they do it  well here. Ryder is the star of this story although everyone gets  decent screen time. Ryder's character - the more independent,  feminist-type thinker - will always get preference anyway in a  Hollywood film. My favorite of the ""Little Women"" was ""Beth,"" the most  kind and compassionate one. Claire Danes' innocent face won me over.  The real beauty was the grown-up ""Amy,"" played by Samantha Mathis. Most  of her role, however, is seen as a young girl and played by Kirsten  Dunst, who has gone on to become a pretty famous actress. The other  sister is ""Meg,"" who is a solid, conservative woman and is played by  Trini Alvarado. Her role is the smallest of the four girls.  Sarandon's ""Mrs. Abagail 'Marmee' March,"" holds everyone together as  the mother and head of the household while her husband is off fighting  at War. She looks more like an older sister.  I liked the March daughters' suitors in here, too. First there was  ""Laurie"" or ""Teddy"" as he also was called by the girls. A young  Christian Bale played him. Then there was Gabriel Byrne as ""Friedrich  Bhaer."" It was a bit strange hearing this Irishman play a part that  required a German accent. Eric Stoltz plays Meg's future husband, ""John  Brooke."" He starts off as someone with a very stiff personality but  soon changes into a warm and good husband.  If this film appears slow in the first 20-30 minutes, hang in there  because it gets better and better as it goes along. This is just a  beautiful film with fantastic visuals and memorable story that should  bring a tear or two to your eyes by the end. Great storytelling usually  wins out, and that's the case with this movie.",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2020,Special-K88,," a terrific novel effectively brought to life
","Superlative, mostly faithful adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's acclaimed novel of four impoverished teenage sisters who come of age in Civil War era New England. The film chronicles ambitious scribe Jo, decorative and impressionable Meg, timid, musically inclined Beth, and artistic, precocious Amy, with emphasis placed on their relationship with their beloved ""Marmee"" and their growing bond with the playful, cultured boy next door as they attempt to make their way while their father is off fighting in the war. While devoted readers may have wished for an ending that was more in line with the novel, this is perfectly cast and brilliantly acted, with wonderful characters, a pinpoint sense of the time period, and genuine emotions that flow throughout the proceedings; a worthy adaptation indeed. ***",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2019,annlevtex,8," My Favorite Film Version
","I first read this book when I was about ten years old, then again every couple of years until I hit twenty. I have since read it once again, and have seen every version except the recent BBC one. This is my favorite film remake of Little Women. Every version suffers, to some degree, from the film/television conventions of its time. June Allyson as Jo is too cute, albeit tomboyishly so. Katherine Hepburn, though wonderful, too crisp and aristocratic. Wynona Ryder some might say is too girlish and vulnerable, but I like that about her performance. Because Jo, for all of her independence, is still a girl in many ways. Jo is a tomboy, a writer, and a budding young woman, all at once. She blossoms throughout the film, and loses some of her prickliness without losing her spirit and color.",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2019,rs-89619,10," One of the best adaptations
",I really enjoyed this version. It was depicted with class & Grace & what an outstanding cast. Remaking this one with the actors they chose is what made this version the only version I'll watch.,/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2003,mercybell,10," a triumph
","I hear it's really hard to turn a book into a movie, and even as a viewer, I notice this. You can keep the book and lose a movie, or you make a movie and lose a book.  But this balances and keeps the essence of the book and creates a miraculous movie that works on every single level.",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2002,Boyo-2,8," Wow, what do you know? A worthy remake!
","I've seen the original, starring Katherine Hepburn as Jo which was directed by George Cukor in (what seems to be) 1901.  That's an excellent version of this story, a real classic.",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2006,LeadingLadybug,10," Heartwarming and true to the book
","""Little Women"" is a gem of a movie, encompassing comedy, drama, and romance into one well-made film that is true to Louisa May Alcott's literary classic. It follows the lives of the four March sisters, from the turbulence of youth, the turmoil and romance of adolescence, the joy of love, and the pain of loss. The quality of this movie depends entirely upon the chemistry between the actors, and it accomplished this with success. The film is a vignette of scenes throughout the sisters' lives, showing their relationships with one another and with the people around them.",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2020,thehigger-61176,10," Best Version Out There
","Having seen all the versions, including the 2019 version, this is the best out of all of them. Much truer to the book, as are the characters. Totally charming, beautiful dialogue and music.",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2004,TheArgentWolf,," A worthy remake
","In general, I don't like film remakes of books, but this is a great exception, because this movie is a complete masterpiece. It follows the March girls - Amy, Beth, Meg, and Jo - through their lives and loves.",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2020,auuwws,9," Little Women
","One of the best romantic movies I have seen in a long time, most of the actors were excellent. They singled out Winona Ryder, who represented Jo greatly. Meg's death was very sad. The film made me feel cheerful and I testify it strongly recommend watching it",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2019,Quinoa1984,8," In three word: a lovely quilt
","I don't know if I have much to say about this movie, save for two things: First, the much younger version of myself never would have gone near this, and looking back I can understand it and seeing it now as a grown I'd-like-to-think-vaguely-mature person I appreciate it a lot more (though it makes me wish I had a little sister growing up as I'm sure she would've watched it and I imagine not leaving the room). And secondly, the most succinct way I can think to describe what Little Women 1994 is... It's like being wrapped up in your genuinely loving and wholesome grandmother's *quilt, made from all natural fibers. It's warm and comforting and yet it tells some real truths about the world, and if you wake up in it it will still be just as comforting (or to put it another way, it's the best possible version of what I picture Hallmark movies are like, with the major boost of a cast that includes people like Winona Ryder and Eric Stoltz - what a fascinating 1994 those two had in movies - and Christian Bale rocking a goatee just when his character Laurie is at his moodiest).",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2010,TheLittleSongbird,9," Stunning film, and a great adaptation of a wonderful book
","Other than this version, the only other version I have seen of the beautiful book is the 1949 version with June Allyson, Margaret O'Brien and Mary Astor. While that version was very good, I think I marginally prefer this version. It is a little too slow at the beginning, but other than that I had no problems with this version of Little Women.",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2020,ekammin-2,8," Loved It
","I preferred this version to the new one. It was very true to the book. I cried a lot, remembering how I read the book when I was a little girl.",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2006,lee_eisenberg,10," little women, big quality
","Louisa May Alcott's classic novel gets brought magnificently to the screen. Everyone in the movie does a great job. There is one scene that might make you cry (you'll know it when you see it). I guess that any 19th century story set in New England is destined to make a great movie. If absolutely nothing else, ""Little Women"" is a very good spot in the filmography of Winona Ryder, Gabriel Byrne, Trini Alvarado, Samantha Mathis, Kirsten Dunst, Claire Danes, Christian Bale, Eric Stoltz, John Neville and Susan Sarandon. Truly something that everyone should see.",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 1998,pied,10," This timeless classic pulls at the heart strings.
","A film so beautiful, lovely, and true that it will remain in your heart long after.  All the parts played flawlessly, a location which is evocative of Alcott's beloved Concord, Massachusetts.  Family life at its best.  I highly recommend this film and the book written by Louisa May Alcott.  They are timeless classics.",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2002,The_Sisk0,10," I have always loved ""Little Women"" this is a wonderful rendition.
","The actors did a wonderful job.  The wardrobe, scenery, furniture --- everything seemed authentic. I smiled, laughed and cried!!!!!! I really enjoyed watching this movie.   Susan Sarandon was just perfect (as usual)",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2017,Hitchcoc,10," Shows a Good Story Can Be Made Even Better
","When I bought my first VCR in the 1980's, the first movie I recorded off TV was the Katherine Hepburn version of of ""Little Women."" I recorded it to see if I could get the machine to work. It did and I found that the movie was excellent (I was stunned that I could fast forward through the commercials). So I have a warm place in my heart (I'm sure I saw the old one some other time as well) for this film. There have been some pretty good remakes before, but I find this contemporary one to be really good. With an all-star cast, an excellent screenplay, and a beautiful setting, this timeless book is brought to life. I know some people find it sentimental and maudlin, but it's a really fine portrayal of a time. Also, the characters are often talked about as goody-two-shoes. This is far from the truth. The girls have their own personalities and frequently clash in harsh and mean ways. The movie is unpredictable and true to the author. It doesn't follow a formula that it could have. See this if you have not.",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2020,Kirpianuscus,," beautiful
","Long time, I saw this adaptation as the best. First, for performances, for admirable work of Winona Ryder, for splendid job of Christian Bale ( sure, as fan , am very subjective) but, especially for fine Marmee of Susan Sarandon. I saw it after decades and the main virtue remains ts adorable freshness. Something magic giving, maybe, new nuances to the novel images. So, just beautiful.",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2021,bellino-angelo2014,8," Probably one of the best adaptations of the novel
","LITTLE WOMEN is probably one of the novels that has the greatest number of movie adaptations. To date there are 7 movies and 7 TV miniseries based on it, to the point where you actually wonder if they don't get tired of always telling the same story with a different cast. Because of this I was reticent to watch the 1994 adaptation, but after seeing it I thought my fears were unfounded.",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2001,gareth3es,," Incredible!
","When I saw Little women I noticed I had seen my favourite movie, I could not believe  a film where my favourite actors played together in one of the most beautiful stories ever written. Gilliam Armstrong`s adaptation is the best I`ve seen,the performances were incredible, specially, Winona Ryder and Christian Bale. But all of them where great, it also has a wonderful score, one of the most beautiful soundtracks I`ve ever heard, Thomas Newman did an excellent job, the script, made by Robin Swicord,is very loyable to the book by Louisa May Alcott.This film is beautiful in all its aspects, it was excellent the friendship and collaboration between all the actors, and for the first time most of them were played by actors of the same age as their fictional characters. The character of Jo has influenced me a lot, and I adore her, Winona Ryder did the best performance of his career, Christian Bale is the best Laurie I`ve ever seen, he did it great, he was so credible, it is difficult to understand why Jo refuses his marriage proposals, he was her perfect husband. Kirsten Dunst was quite OK like the young Amy, not so well done by  the older Amy, played by Samantha Mathis, who loses the joy and the energy of the young one. Eric Stoltz was incredible, although his role is a very supporting one. Gabriel Byrne was the perfect professor Baerh, he was great, he does perfectly a German accent. Susan Sarandon was brilliant like Marmee, and I think Claire Danes does an inolvidable performance, a bit ignored after the movie was realised. Trini Alvarado  is excellent like Meg. Not only the performances, but all the team that worked in the movie did a great job, the costumes were beautifully designed, the cinematography was brilliant. at least, what I have to say is that this movie has influenced me a lot, all the characters were lovely , the strength of Jo, her dreams of being a writter(I want to be a writer too), her way of think, her beauty,her power. I feel like if I was Laurie lots of times, Laurie is one of the most lovely male characters in the history of literature. And I think this is possible mostly because of Winona Ryder and Christian Bale. I couldn`t imagine a better couple of actors. An incredible and unforgettable movie.",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2001,rachel.near,," Perfectly cast, lovely
","This version of Little Women is lovely. Everyone is perfectly cast, and fans of the novel will be happy that it is quite true-to-book. Winona Ryder is perfect as Jo, quite equal to Katherine Hepburn's performance in the 1933 version. Susan Sarandon is wonderful (though I'm not sure Marmee would talk about 'restrictive corsets' to John Brooke). :) Christian Bale is an excellent Laurie, and Gabriel Byrne is wonderful as our Professor Bhaer. Kirsten Dunst and Claire Danes showed acting ability beyond their years. Trini Alvarado was a very pretty and sweet Meg. Samantha Mathis was a very pretty older Amy, but she could have been more lively. Eric Stoltz was a great John Brooke. I had never pictured Brooke with red hair, but it was nice. The rest of the cast was terrific, especially Mary Wickes as Aunt March. For once, Mary wasn't playing somebody's nurse or maid. :)",/review/rw6345404/?ref_=tt_urv
