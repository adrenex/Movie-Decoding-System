27 September 2011,daxdsnine,8," Fun show
","I watched the premiere out of curiosity, and I was surprised to find a show that is both interesting and done in a very tasteful manner. I was worried about the depiction of female characters (for obvious reasons), but they are not depicted as simple sexual objects. On the contrary, these characters are shown as intelligent, independent, and resourceful.",/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2011,kat12986,8," Loved it!
","I honestly loved it. I love Amber Heard, the main girl. She's one of my favorite up and coming actresses. I thought Eddie Cibrian was amazing too. David Krumhotlz portrayed the uptight jerk of a manager pretty well. There was a murder (accidental)before the first commercial break! There's a lot of drama. I think it's definitely more geared to women surprisingly. I don't think my husband would like it. It's mostly the life of the bunnies, which would appeal more to women. I don't know. I don't think you should watch it or not watch it based on someone else's review. If you want to watch, watch it and find out for yourself if it's your kind of show.",/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2011,GoddessCeCe,9," Fabulous and Smart! One of the best new shows of the Season!
","I am not at all sure what the other posters are watching, but to say this show is boring is completely off the mark. Then again, I guess it depends on what you are looking for.",/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2012,Maniac-9,7," Should have been given a better chance
","The show had a few faults but not enough to warrant a cancellation after only 7 episodes, NBC never really gave it a chance to last. If the show had debuted on AMC, FX, HBO or any cable network it would have been allowed a better chance to build an audience. But nowadays networks assume that if you don't instantly have a 10% share of its time slot right off the bat that it's a failure and there's no point in even going on with the show. Which is a ridiculous way of trying to build and cultivate new shows for a channel.",/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2011,mitchwatt2,10," Better than expected !
","When I started watching The Playboy Club I wasn't very hopeful... I was expecting a dodgy half baked drama with girls running around topless... I found the pilot plot Interesting, maybe a tad cliché, but it is a pilot after all! You can't expect miracles. ",/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2011,magdalena-jovanova,10," Great Show
","I think that the show was excellent! It was tensed and interesting till the end, and looks very promising. The cast is great, and not just Edie Cibrian. Maybe there are too many plots and mysteries, so I can not wait to watch another episode of it. I Like the 1960's theme and the outfit of the bunnies is so fit to the timing. I can tell that the main character bunny Morrean has a lot to offer for the show, and that these two will get in love or something. Anyway, can't wait! I think that the show was excellent!

28 September 2011,ianfitzgerald,9," Refreshing Show
","A refreshing show who's plot is not in a courtroom, law enforcement's building, hospital, or on a reality stage (like we don't have enough of those already). Great story lines, a cast that is not over-rated, and refreshing new faces.",/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2011,TxMike,," One of the better (cancelled) new shows for 2011 TV season, takes us to the original Chicago Playboy Club.
",EDIT: Unfortunately it was cancelled quite quickly. I enjoyed the show!,/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2011,tonyamhughes,9," I actually liked the show! I will miss it!
",I actually liked the show and wished they did not cancel it! I wish another network would pick it up. It does not matter to me if it really happened or not it had a good story line. It is ashame that people do not see that despite the exploitation that is what it was like back then to some degree! whatever I will miss it! People liked Mad Men but they do not like the playboy bunny club. The characters were just getting interesting. I could not wait to find out more about the relationship of the lead bunny. I could not wait to see the relationships unfold and characters develop more. I really hope another network picks up the show and it will continue!!,/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2011,jmb286-177-784931,10," Pleasantly surprised by this show, maybe it' actually more for a female audience?
","This show definitely started off to a rocky start, but the more we see of all of the supporting cast, and all the other girl's stories, the better it gets. All of the women thus far are charming, and the new inclusion of Cassidy Freeman is fantastic (she was one of he best actors on Smallville). I'm also very intrigued to find out where the ""in the closet support group"" is going. I'm finding that pretty fascinating, and it's being handled very well. Both The Playboy Club, and Pan-Am seem to be geared more towards women, and there empowerment, but i'd argue that the playboy club is a little more ""fun"" to enjoy. I truly hope the show stays adrift, and encourage you to watch!",/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2011,lilar-184-229431,10," I LOVED The Playboy Club
","I'm really upset that this show was cancelled. What do we have to do to get it back on the air? - I don't care where, just get it back on the air. What did I love about The Playboy Club? - The plot was great, - there was great music, - I loved the intrigue - I loved the nostalgia - I thought the depiction of Chicago in the early '60's was really good - I believed that the show had a great storyline - I believed that the show had enormous potential - I believed the show had great acting",/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2011,mattias_89,5," My Thoughts on the Pilot
","I'm so disappointed in this episode. This was one of the series I had been looking forward to the most for this falls line-up. I liked the premise of the show and after watching the first episode I still like where the story is heading, but everything else was pretty bad.",/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2011,dashti-t,10," Perfect ..
","When I saw the trailer a couple of weeks before the premiere, I didn't really know what to expect, the first thing that came to my mind was ""Oh, girls in bunny costumes, and they're all HOT.. I got to watch this!"" ",/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2011,Scott_Mercer,," Obviously a Rip-Off of ""Mad Men""
","I'm about to be cynical and dismissive, but since the producers of this show have been lurking in those same waters then I feel no compunctions about returning the favor.",/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2011,timboytx,3," Cliché should be just a starting point
","My expectations for ""The Playboy Club"" have been low, due to its overt attempt to clone the far superior ""Mad Men"". In spite of that, the show has kept me interested enough to watch both of the shows that have aired, and I will continue to watch for a few more episodes to see if it ever hooks me. Part of the brilliance of ""Mad Men"" is that it dives headlong into cliché and usually surprises the viewer with an unexpected angle on that cliché. In ""The Playboy Club"", the makers follow firmly in the footsteps of ""Mad Men"", but forget to include the surprises. It is awash in cliché, saved only by the high quality of the art direction and acting. Even the musical performances fall short. The songs may be top-notch and sung well, but the direction cripples them with a ""Glee""-like artificiality and a lack of imagination. In episode two, for example, the arrangement of ""In the Mood"" -- a song from the thirties -- is a virtual duplicate of Bette Midler's version from 1973. How is that choice appropriate for a show set in the sixties, particularly when the production designers are so careful about visual authenticity? Why not duplicate an arrangement from the sixties, or maybe even create something new?",/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2011,Mike1388,5," The Boring Club
","I've high hope for this as I liked what I saw in the trailer before watching the pilot episode. The playboy club has chance to be a worth watching series, but matching mob and hot girls is just a turn off (for me) and not really interesting. I thought the series will focus more about the bunnies, their clients, the mansion and of course, Hefner, but instead we got a boring piece of crap about bunny killing a mafia boss. I gave it five out of ten, because I like the lead actors both Amber Heard and Eddy Cibrian did good and there are definite chemistry too. I will give it more episodes to go, and hope by then the whole mob-danger storyline has vanish and focus more on the Playboy Club.",/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2011,clarinetsaxist,," A Very Attractive TV Playmate
","I have only watched the pilot to date- I am going to watch the second episode tonight. I give this show a 10 out of 10 for it's production value. However, the story is admittedly less than masterful, led by a mix of characters that so far feel relatively underdeveloped. However, it's only the pilot episode! It took me at least 4-6 episodes to fully become a loyal fan of ""Mad Men."" Furthermore, this show is first and foremost supposed to be a fluffy good time. I applaud this show for having as much sex appeal as it does on broadcast TV. Because, s show is this sexy does not mean people should be extra critical of it. The pilot offers some fine moments. I was intrigued at the dorm-like community of the playboy mansion. One can only hope this show introduces new tidbits down the road. One priceless scene involves Amber Heard joining a group of the bunnies dancing in the club. The joy on their faces and their moves filled me with some joy.",/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2011,georgigems,2," What a waste of time!
","I thought from the previews that this show had some potential. What a turkey! The writing was so bad that it seemed like a first draft of a high school project. The acting was even worse. A total waste of time. Every character was plastic and most slept thru their lines and parts, except Eddie C who could have phoned his in. Having had some experience in the real world of the Playboy clubs , this wasn't even authentic. No bunny flirted with customers, you were simply a pretty waitress and the bunny mother made sure there was no fooling around and rules were strictly adhered to. This show is a joke! Early cancellation would be a mercy killing.",/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2011,malcolmcmcclintock,4," Pretty disappointed
","Now I'm a huge fan of the 50's 60's era and I'm not here to compare this show to Mad Men (even if i love it). This show fails to give the illusion of the 60's, which at first glance of the previews was one of the biggest pulls the show had. On top of that, the acting and plot line are dull and slightly predictable, clichés around every corner, and, a huge pet peeve of mine is the background music. Lack of class, lack of seduction, and unrealistic. I haven't quite managed to fall in love with any characters yet, but that doesn't mean i wont. I will continue to watch this show for the first season, hoping and hoping that they can think this whole thing through.",/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv

","Don't waste your time with this one. Hopefully they cancel it soon. Moves to slow, no action. Maybe chicks will love it but not for guys.",/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2011,wimpy-818-580363,," Great idea - Poor execution
","High expectations with little delivered. This series wants to re-write history and have us all believe that things actually might have happened the way it has been portrayed. I was too young to have gone to an actual Playboy, but I'm old enough to remember them and the mystique involved with being a member. This series would have you believe that patrons could not only dance and mingle with bunnies, but that it was simple for a patron to gain access to ""employee only"" areas without being thrown out. The whole concept of the Playboy club was a ""Look, but don't Touch"" mentality that the management took quite seriously. Bunnies were not only forbidden to date key-holders, but a perceived violation of the fraternization policies could get one fired quickly.",/review/rw2494089/?ref_=tt_urv
