1 February 2007,ExpendableMan,9," I laughed my arse off
","Glancing over some of the other reviews of Me, Myself and Irene that crop up on this page, it seems loads of people absolutely hate this movie. If anything, the majority of negative comments appear to be coming from people quick to dismiss it as a dumb piece of un-PC gross out comedy, which is completely missing the point. This is a Farrelly Brothers film with Jim Carrey in the lead role, what were they expecting? Citizen Kane redux? I myself have a masters degree in Film Studies and while I like to sit around, stroking my beard (or failing that, somebody else's), watching Almodovar films and saying ""fascinating"" at regularly timed intervals, I also like to laugh. And Me, Myself and Irene is one of the most gut bustingly funny films I've watched in months.",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2008,Chrysanthepop,," Me Laughing, Myself Laughing and Irene's Cute
","'Me, Myself and Irene' is one of the few comedies that have a strong repeat value as it always made me laugh every time I rewatched it. Sure it has its share of crude humour. After all, it is a Farelly Brothers movie but none of it bothered me (as was the case with 'There's Something About Mary'. I just love the whole wackiness of it, the adventurous feel, the landscapes, the comic timing, the story, the lively soundtrack...all of it combined brings a freshness. Jim Carrey is in his hilarious comic form. He and Zellweger form a great pair (of course it's also known that they were dating during the film production) and have a brilliant chemistry. Zellweger is cute and vivacious. It was quite fun to watch Chris Cooper play the villain. the rest of the cast (which is a lot) contribute well. 'Me, Myself and Irene' is one of my favorite comedies, simply because it hasn't lost its repeat value and gets me laughing out loud.",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2005,FrankBooth_DeLarge,7," Surprisingly hilarious
","Back when I first saw the commercials for this movie, I thought it looked pretty stupid. One day, I was at the video rental place and I decided to rent this because I like most of the Farrely brothers movies, and I also think Jim Carrey is hilarious. What I got was a big surprise, a hilarious movie that looks dumb on the surface, but really makes you laugh out loud.",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2000,Quinoa1984,8," Black guys talking German
","This film is not only the funniest film of the year (so far), but one of the best of the year (so far). Jim Carrey's comedy antics (not seen this good in 3 years) makes a come back thanks to the Farrelly brothers (Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary) who make their 2nd collaboration. Here, Carrey plays a gentle police officer who gets screwed in life so many times, he grows a new personality that is incredibly bad. ",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2001,martymaster,," One of Jim Carreys best performances.
","This movie is made by the famous Farrelly brothers and then you can of course expect how it is,funny from beginning to end. This movie like all the other Farrelly movies,take up issues which most people would find shocking.They joke about things that is so embarrassing and funny. I must say that I love this kind of comedy and can't wait until the next Farrelly movie.",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2000,bat-5,8," Jim Carrey and the Farrely doing what they do best.
","There is probably no other movie coming out this summer that will produce more from the gut laughs than Me, Myself & Irene.  Sure it's crude, sure it's vulgar and juvenile at times, but sometimes we just have to take ourselves back to when we were younger and used to laugh at things that we would otherwise find rather disgusting.  The main treat is to watch Carrey transform from the sweet natured Charlie to the vulgar, Dirty Harry sounding Hank.  Hank does things that not many people would even dream of, and it's a kick to see him get away with some of them.  Equally funny are Charlie's three sons, who are highly intelligent, love their dad and use a certain phrase to great effect.  Some may find this movie offensive and occasionally funny at times, but I found it enjoyable from beginning to end.   A good way to blow off steam from a bad day.",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2001,daveisit,6," Breathing Styles Differ
","I find it strange so many people disliked this movie. Just because a critic dislikes a movie, doesn't mean you have to dislike it too! I'm not suggesting it was the greatest comedy of all time, but it certainly achieved its purpose. ",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2015,Mr-Fusion,7," A lot of this is so dumb, but I laughed harder than expected
","""Me, Myself and Irene"" doesn't deviate from the Farrellys' trademark scatological humor, but that works to a surprising degree here. It'd be unfair to say that Jim Carrey is the cog that makes this all work (seeing as there are so many other necessary pieces to this puzzle), but he's playing his physical comedy to the hilt, and it's some entertaining stuff. The guy even gets into a convincing brawl with himself. It's beautiful. But it's not just Carrey; Zellweger fits pretty well, his three sons steal every one of their scenes and it even has space enough for a persistent dildo. As a road movie, it's not nearly as focused as ""Dumb and Dumber"" (really tends to wander), but there's some genuinely funny material here.",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2019,UniqueParticle,9," I love this quirky movie more than I should!
","Jim Carrey is meant for these wild roles and this is among one of my favorite Farrelly brothers projects! Also on IMDb it should say Charlie/Hank not just Charlie. This definitely has a bunch of dumb stuff but I laugh so hard every time and I think Me, Myself, and Irene deserves more appreciation. Rene Zellweger is so great, I relish her earlier roles more than her newer ones. One of those types I can watch excessively no problem and still love so much of it!!",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2006,kittiwake-1,7," hilarious, a laugh riot
","OK, Jim Carrey fans, this is Jim doing some of his very best work. I don't think anyone else could have pulled off playing Charlie Baileygates. I was disappointed in Renee Zellweger's performance, but I'm not really a big fan of hers. (And, for the record, I'm also not too fond of Carrey's over-the-top style, but I pick and choose to make sure I see him in roles I would like.) The Farrelly brothers, known for their irreverent comedy, made this movie enjoyable and hilarious. I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone. Just expect twists and turns that leave you laughing. This movie is not for the faint-hearted, and it's not for kids. (If you've never seen a Farrelly movie, you'll need to know this!) This is not laden with ""Oscar-quality"" performances at all, but just something to watch when you want to laugh and not think. -- Movies like this are good, if that is what you're looking for. The plot was great, and the casting (overall) was incredible. I can't get over Charlie's family. You'll see! I find them the most fun of all. Watch it with good friends who love to laugh -- I think we can all find something like Charlie in all of us.",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2021,pamcakeseva,9," Rolling on floor laughing!!!
","Wow - such a funny movie! Loved this so much and laughed out loud ALOT!!! Totally one of the best Jim Carey movies eva, he really is so funny. It's a cool idea, with so many funny scenes (even a bit sad in places) but in the end just a good feelgood flick. Loved it!",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2007,capike-1,10," It's hilarious !
","Funniest movie I have seen in a long time, wish I had seen it much earlier. I thought I had grown tired of Jim Carrey movies. He seemed like the same character in just about every film. True enough, I can still see elements of the same kind of character in this film, but I think the story is a good one. Renee Zellwegger is lovely and sexy. There were so many funny moments in this movie, from when Jim Carrey nurses on the lovely young mother to the very end when the three boys leave us with ""Thank you for watching our **** movie!"" I actually got all of my friends to watch this movie with me because I was so excited about it and it's already almost 7 years old. Who knew? I guess that just goes to show that you can't judge an actor or a movie until you've seen it.",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2019,FeastMode,9," my notes
","Absolutely hysterical. so many great and original ideas. this is by far Jim Carey's best comedic performance. and hank is one of the best, funniest and unique characters I've watched (5 viewings)",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2022,fingazmc,10," The cotton mouth scene alone....
","I felt like I had to do something here. 6.6 is insanely low for a comedy this good. Carey always tends to be good, so,you know it's gonna be above a certain standard.",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv

2 December 2017,sol-,5," Him, Himself & Her
","Diagnosed with a split personality disorder, problems arise for a milquetoast cop when he forgets his medication while escorting a state witness in this road trip comedy from the Farrelly Brothers. As others have pointed out, the film is a little like 'Dumb & Dumber' but with Jim Carrey playing off himself (his other personality) rather than Jeff Daniels, and fans of the Golden Globe winning actor are likely to enjoy him strutting his stuff here. For the general film-goer though, this is a movie to approach with some caution. The film throws around some interesting ideas regarding assertiveness and expressing one's feelings, but with an overload of exposition and such childish gags like uncontrolled urination and a chicken stuck where the sun does not shine, this is very much a mixed bag of a movie. The antagonists in the tale are not particularly menacing or memorable either, though as usual, the Farrellys get several memorable turns from the rest of their supporting cast. Michael Bowman shines in particular as a social misfit albino man who befriends Carrey. In a unique and interesting touch, the end credits also include stills of all bit players in the cast with arrows to identifying actors they are.",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2022,Benji-80,7," When comedies were funny
","This would not get made now. If you've never seen it, watch it and you'll see what I mean. If you haven't watched it in years (as I hadn't), watch it again and you'll also see what I mean. It's raunchy, it's outrageous, and it's not PC, at all. Jim Carrey is excellent value, and is hilarious. And as an added bonus, Renee Zellweger has never looked better. If this is your type of thing (as it is mine), check it out.",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2021,kosmasp,8," Two Face Carrey
","Wait a minute didn't he ... in Batman? No he didn't! It was Tommy Lee Jones! Carrey was the Riddler! But at least you got the movie right, if you though that. In this case it is not a two face as in literally, but more in a schizophrenic kind of way. Having said all that if one can pull it off, it is Jim Carrey.",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2019,ronbell-23984,10," Hilarious
","I laughed my arse off frankly. Definitely not for the PC crowd. Carrey at his best, some very funny moments.",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2001,FlasyNimoy,10," EXCELLENT film!
","Great directing, great story line, great acting. Jim Carrey is brilliant in his role as both ""Hank"" and ""Charlie."" The problem with rating any comedy is that what's funny for one person is repulsive, boring or stupid to the next. You can't please everyone---but this one definitely comes close (hence, the above average overall rating at IMDB). Don't miss this one!",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2006,ccthemovieman-1,6," 'Not For All Tastes,' As They Say
","What a wacky movie! It gets most of the ""stars"" in the rating here for the entertainment value of the film. As low-brow as it is in spots, you never get bored watching it. ",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2012,namashi_1,9," Jim Carrey is Superb!
","Jim Carrey delivers a yet another Superb Performance in 'Me, Myself & Irene'. Also Working on its advantage, this Farrelly brothers directed comedy delivers some really memorable & funny moments in the goings-on. ",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2019,csuarezu,9," The cow stills alive!
","I dont understand how this masterpiece has 6.6 in this platform. Probably, one of the top 3 movies of Jim Carrey.",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2002,PhilauraJ,8," Unexpectedly Hilarious!
","First let me say I really DID NOT LIKE ""Something About Mary"" and ""Dumb & Dumber"", But I totally  enjoyed this film.  It has a heart, that the other two do not.  Unlike ""Something About Mary"" the jokes are not based on people's physical pain or disabilities. Or in ""Dumb and Dumber"" where I just could not relate to or care about the ridiculous characters.  Instead, MM&I portrays a sweet, caring underdog that is being horribly taken advantage of by everyone and gives him a leg up in the world with the emergence of a split personality that takes revenge. This split personality is weird and a sicko but he kicks ass.  He's an unlikely hero, but gotta love him for coming to the rescue. It's silly fun that showcases Carey's talents very well. Jim has got to be the all time best physical comedy performer.",/review/rw0619582/?ref_=tt_urv
