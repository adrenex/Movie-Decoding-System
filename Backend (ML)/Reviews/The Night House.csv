27 March 2021,songod-95003,2," Bade edits make this unwatchable
","There is something called ""hard cuts"" aka ""hard edits"" in movie talk. They mean that there is no transitional footage between scenes. This is fine and not that jarring if you are telling a story in a linear fashion. BUT if the movie is jumping time lines without any warning, well, it makes the film impossible to follow even when you get used to the time jumps (present to forward; future to present) because you do not really know where you are.",/review/rw6553001/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,5," When you're making a revenge thriller at 6:15, soft p0rn at 6:22, but have a Nat.Geo docu at 6:30
","This was the absolutely most annoyingly too-long and too-slow film I've ever seen. Someone forgot to get the reel to the editor, because each and every scene was between 25-95% too long and dragged out. I lost count how many times we all yelled at the screen ""omg get on with it already"" or ""someone please fast forward this already"". This film is the epitome of ""too much filler and very little substance"". I've never been and seen a more annoyed audience.",/review/rw6553001/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2021,cruelworldfilms,4," A sum less than its parts.
","I'll start with the good: well scripted (v. Linklater-like conversational dialogue), well directed (hats off to Madeleine Sims-Fewer and Dusty Mancinelli), beautiful cinematography (that'd give Lars Von Trier a run for his money).",/review/rw6553001/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2021,m-burakyuksel-564-438070,3," Even the murder scene in the movie was far from scary
","The pace of the movie was very slow. I got bored watching. It's not a horror movie. The drama aspect of the movie predominates. The director emulates biologists in the movie. He took a long shot of clear, enlarged images of caterpillars, birds, fingers and fingernails, and even the stamens. It's like he wasted time prolonging unnecessary scenes so that the movie would be longer.",/review/rw6553001/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,jimbob255,2," Slow,boring and confusing
",Waste of time film . Style over substance as in it looks really good but the story was stupid and made little sense. I only gave it 2 stars and it gets one of those for the scenery . I saw it through to the end and still have no idea what was going on.,/review/rw6553001/?ref_=tt_urv

","SXSW 2021
Greetings again from the darkness. Not just another rape-revenge thriller, this film from co-writers and co-directors Dusty Manicinelli and Madeleine Sims-Fewer is one of the most brutal and unforgiving films I've seen in a while. Emotional pain, regret, bitterness, and compromise worm through every scene and every character.",/review/rw6553001/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2020,Also_Kiki,4," I really wanted to like this film.
","When I saw Violation at TIFF earlier this year, the passion from the creators was more than evident, with their capabilities being well showcased in the short films created in the past 13 years or so. A lot of those technical capabilities can be found here, made more impressive by the film's small budget. It features a solid performance from Madeline Sims-Fewer in the lead role, some fantastic color choices, and impressive practical effects. However, where this film falls flat in my opinion is in the content of its story. The film has a solid concept at its core, and naturally warrants a slower pace; but unfortunately does not make good use of its time. Between long conversation scenes adding little to the story, and intense scenes progressively becoming sluggish, the hour and 40 minute runtime of the film ultimately feels unwarranted, and often padded. I would love to see more from the directors, as they are clearly very talented, but Violation unfortunately left me feeling disappointed.",/review/rw6553001/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2021,andrewchristianjr,6," DIFFERENT.
","It's wholly different from any other rape-revenge movie out there, and has so much to say about the genre and an audience's thirst for revenge. Not strictly a horror film. I'd call it more of a Haneke type drama with some truly grotesque moments.",/review/rw6553001/?ref_=tt_urv

27 March 2021,Xstal,7," A Dish Served with Violence, Volatility & Very Hot
","If you go down to the woods today and you're a rabbit or a predatory opportunist, there's a good chance you'll get your big surprise and it won't be a pleasant picnic. Refreshing and brave, original and relevant, reflective and increasingly expansive, just as progressive and contemporary filmmaking should be.",/review/rw6553001/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,daniel_d-08951,2," Very realistic and gory, lots of overly long gross-out scenes
","Very realistic and gory, lots of overly long gross-out scenes that could have been completely avoided without affecting the story at all. This could have worked a lot better as a short film that could have easily gotten the point across, but instead it's a very slow and not enjoyable movie to watch. Some cinematography and nature scenes were nice so I have to give it a point for that, but the editing was all over the place and did not make it easy to follow or enjoy the movie.",/review/rw6553001/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2021,zombie84-1,3," thats it I give up
","I give up listening to reviewers on sites, who say movies are messed up when they arent even close. I spit on your grave, irrversible, and the most recent movie nightengale are brutal revenge movies. And even the movie revenge was more brutal then this. If you wanta be bored to death watch this nonsense. I gave it a 3/10 for the random killing of the dude that was the only decent thing and even that was crap.",/review/rw6553001/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2021,JoelChamp85,5," Lacking Depth
","The story follows an overly emotional, manic depressant, pommy chick who needs to be either the centre of the party or ruins the party. After flirting all night with her friend's husband she wakes to him taking advantage of her and that sends her into a downward spiral. The performances and cinematography are good, plus there's some nice practical gore FX, but the story is almost non-existent. The trailer review quote says ""Unflinching and Brutal"", but I definitely saw a wiener flinching somewhere lol. I think they've copied Antichrist (2009) in a way.",/review/rw6553001/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2021,kosmasp,7," Deep cuts
","How do you deal with grey areas? Now the main incident that kicks our main character ... out of her ""comfort zone"" I reckon you could call it ... is something that a lot of people will have a debate over. The movie almost dares you to talk about it ... make a judgement ... give your take on what you think happened or rather who is to blame - maybe even both individuals.",/review/rw6553001/?ref_=tt_urv

5 October 2021,tlkkel,1," More annoying and angry than artful or meaningful. Not a charcter study, just a pissed off revenge film with bad editing
","OK. I saw I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (The original!) in the theater back in the 70s! At least that movie didnt claim art as its lead. It specifically warned its audience in the promos and the media. ""Woman gets revenge on her rapist , cuts off his dick!"" and it sold itself on that/ Nobody pumped it up as art, opr a triumph of woman against her rapist, nobody sold it as anything but what it was. A horror revenge film...and youll get to see a rapist get his dick cut off! (2 decades before Lorena Bobbit!)",/review/rw6553001/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2021,atractiveeyes,5," Missed Opportunity
","This movie has potentials and seems really promising but it turns out disappointing. It has great elements like amazing cinematography, beautiful intense score and has a nice idea but the story fails in portraying it. The screenplay seems weak, useless and missing something. And the narrative is so annoying. All in all, Violation is well made but it's confusing and hard to follow.",/review/rw6553001/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2021,john_lubinski,3," Meh.
","It's a shame. The directors' intention was to shock the viewer with explicit sexual stuff but nowadays it does not shock at all. The days of movies like The Nymphomaniac are long gone. Today, such content offends the viewer more than it arouses the viewer's interest. Very poor made movie.",/review/rw6553001/?ref_=tt_urv
