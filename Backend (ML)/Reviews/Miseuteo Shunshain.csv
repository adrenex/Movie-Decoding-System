14 April 2020,Beard_Of_Serpico,8," One of Neeson's best action movies. Gripping, gritty and enjoyable stuff.
","Liam neeson plays Jimmy Conlon, an aging and borderline alcoholic mob hitman who is forced to protect his son from his former boss Shawn Maguire played by the always excellent Ed Harris.
It's a satisfying blend of character drama and gritty, violent action. One of the things i really liked was nothing was overly spectacular and silly which gives the movie a more gritty and realistic feel. The action is quick, brutal and not glamorized and the dialogue feels like things real people would say during regular conversation as well, it gets annoying in movies sometimes when characters are spouting one liners like clowns.",/review/rw3200965/?ref_=tt_urv

","Jimmy (Liam Neeson) is an old hitman who can't sleep, seeing the faces of those that he killed. He lives his life alone smoking cigarettes and drinking scotch. His BFF and old boss is Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris) who is now an honest businessman, while his son, Danny (Boyd Holbrook) is not. Events happen in which Jimmy's estranged son Michael (Joel Kinnaman) becomes a target for Shawn.",/review/rw3200965/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2015,moviexclusive,7," A immensely satisfying blend of gripping mob drama and thrilling action setpieces that is easily Liam Neeson's most credible work in recent years
","Before you dismiss the latest Liam Neeson action movie 'Run All Night' as yet another iteration of 'Taken', let us reassure you that there is much more to this mob thriller than meets the eye. True, Neeson plays a former man of violence with a 'particular set of skills' who is forced to employ them in order to save his family, but that's about where the similarities end. Indeed, while that franchise never quite had any ambition than as a glorified B-movie, this latest team-up between Neeson and his 'Unknown' and 'Non-Stop' collaborator Jaume Collet- Serra proves itself as an impressive amalgamation of the Oscar- nominated dramatic skills on which his earlier career was built on and his more recent kickassery.",/review/rw3200965/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2017,Floated2,7," Well thrilling Action movie
","Liam Neeson, starring in his his now standard turn of several similar action thrillers. A man with a past given a chance to redeem himself with judicious amounts of crowd-pleasing violence. Perhaps it's unfair to say the Northern Irish actor could phone in this performance from anywhere in the world, as he does it so well, but one can understand those that criticize the actor for repeating himself, with the inevitable diminishing effect at the box office.",/review/rw3200965/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2015,kosmasp,7," Crossing that line (together)
","Liam Neeson again has some skills that make him very dangerous. Drunk or not, do not mess with him or his loved ones ... This has a real anti-player in Ed Harris. Someone who can hold his own against Liam. The acting is superb, the action is more than decent. The thrill works and while there is a morality to it, it never challenges the tension it builds at any time.",/review/rw3200965/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2015,eric262003,9," Truly One Of Liam Neeson's Best Action Films
","Situated in the early scenes in a boxing gym is just a great way to kick-start the movie ""Run All Night"" one that's saturated with fine fundamentals added with just a touch of vivacity. Yes you may say that this just familiar territory for Liam Neeson to play another bad-ass who's out to save his estranged son who's life is hanging on the balance. Unlike his other crime action films, Olivier Megaton isn't directing this one. Calling the shots this time around is Jaume Collet-Serra one of the best guys directing in this generation.

","In New York, the decadent alcoholic Jimmy Conlon (Liam Neeson) is the former hit man known as Gravedigger. Jimmy is a lonely man and his only friend is the mobster Sean Maguire (Ed Harris) that was also his boss. Jimmy's estranged son Mike Conlon (Joel Kinnaman) is a former boxer that works as limousine driver and is married with children. Sean's son Danny Maguire (Boyd Holbrook) is an ambitious troublemaker. On the Christmas Day, Danny deals with Albanese drug dealers but Sean refuses to participate. Danny schedules a meeting with the men at home to give the money he had received back. Mike coincidently drives the two Albanese in the limousine and Danny kills them in his house. Then he hunts Mike down since he does not want eyewitnesses for what he did. Jimmy goes to Mike's house and saves his life killing Danny. Now Sean seeks revenge and puts a contract on Jimmy and Mike that are hunted down along the night by the mobsters, the hired hit man and the corrupt police officers. Sean does not want a deal and Jimmy's only chance to protect Mike and his family is the support of the honest Detective Harding (Vincent D'Onofrio) that has been on his tail for many years.",/review/rw3200965/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2015,ahbindare,8," Great action film
","One of the better action movies I've seen in a while. Great characters - great acting and interesting story line. I really liked this film and I don't understand why this movie does not get better reviews. unlike a lot of the popular glitzy action films, this one leaves a memory of what it was really about. The camera work was great and incorporated some of the best and most believable action scenes I have experienced. The language was fitting and not overpopulated with Fbombs. The story line is easy to follow. The soundtrack is appropriate without a lot of unnecessary crashing and banging, or a way over the top, or overpowering soundtrack. Definitely a good film.",/review/rw3200965/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's a better-than-average example of the genre. The genre itself is familiar: All the bad guys are after a couple of good guys. But this one has a bit of texture. We have a bit of sympathy for Ed Harris, the chief bad guy. Harris is a retired mobster, rejecting offers to get back into the dope trade, and he has a loving family. Really bourgeois, you know? His problem is that he has a loopy son who is half nuts and goes around shooting folks for the slightest of reasons, laughing as he pulls the trigger.",/review/rw3200965/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2015,CowherPowerForever,8," As long as you're coming after Michael, I'm coming after you.
","Liam Neeson is back yet again with another action film. Some will claim this is another Taken film, and maybe he is cashing in big time on his success from that franchise, but the story in this film is much deeper overall than the recent Taken films, and the acting is absolutely amazing. With some great acting and a good story overall, Liam Neeson and the legendary Ed Harris deliver a must see film for any movie fan. The following is my review of Run All Night.",/review/rw3200965/?ref_=tt_urv

17 March 2015,burlesonjesse5,7," VIEWS ON FILM review of Run All Night
","""Liam frickin Neeson"". Those are the first thoughts that enter my mind when I discover that Ireland's favorite butt kicker is making another action drama. The look: a leather jacket, an unshaven face, a weariness from the soaking effects of alcohol on the mend. The character: one bad mother, a former hit-man battling inner demons, a 6'4"" juggernaut with a special set of skills. The plot: fathers and sons, mob ties, plenty of chain smoking, bodies piling up. The verdict: 2015's Run All Night is the third collaboration from Neeson and director Jaume Collet-Serra. They scored with last year's Non-Stop and actually top themselves this time with ""Night"". It's a hard-ass, moxie noir that makes you feel unsafe and doesn't give you a chance to breathe. Dare I say that this might be the crowning achievement in Liam's career as a vigilante who's on the verge of collecting his veritable social security.",/review/rw3200965/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2015,lee_eisenberg,5," I wonder if Liam Neeson is ever going to star in a serious movie again.
","If you came of age in the 1990s and early 2000s - as I did - then you know Liam Neeson as the man who played Oskar Schindler, Rob Roy, Jean Valjean and Alfred Kinsey (I deliberately ignore the worst entry in the ""Star Wars"" franchise). Then in the late 2000s he got into a streak of roles that would've gotten played by Harrison Ford in previous years. Jaume Collet-Serra's ""Run All Night"" is the latest entry. Essentially the same plot as Sam Mendes's ""Road to Perdition"", it features Neeson as a hit-man having to choose between loyalty to his estranged son and loyalty to his job.",/review/rw3200965/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2015,poopiter,9," Not Your Run Of The Mill Liam Movie.... I'm Very Impressed
","I went to see this because I found out last minute that ""It Follows"" was only limited release and I'M GLAD I DID! When you go see ""Taken 2"" or ""Walk Among the Tombstones"" you expect crazy action which you definitely get with Run All Night. But what you're not expecting is above average story and acting. There was great suspense with solid characters that you start to care about. There's some larger than life feats that Liam pulls off as usual, but it's done well.",/review/rw3200965/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2015,Quinoa1984,7," a little more character meat on this programmer's bones
","Run All Night is in part meat-n-potatoes action filmmaking... or it would be if not for a few things. First is that the director, Jaume Collet-Sera, is a little afraid of the audience possibly being 'bored' or receiving the same-old-same-old with these things called transitions from scenes taking place in other parts of the city. If you've seen a video game (ala Grand Theft Audo 5) or even Google-Maps, you'll see how this becomes one of those 'flashy-for-the-sake-of-it' moments that you sort of forget or take for granted that filmmakers get away with sometimes. And the story is, from my perspective, a bit of a lift from Road to Perdition: a man who's worked his whole life for a big-time criminal boss becomes a target - as does the hit-man's son - over some BS with the boss' terrible waste of a son, and so they go on the run, with an expert hit-man hired to track down the father and son (in other words, replace Liam Neeson, Ed Harris and Common with Tom Hanks, Paul Newman and Jude Law, you get the idea).",/review/rw3200965/?ref_=tt_urv

3 May 2017,Leofwine_draca,6," Acceptable Liam Neeson thriller
","RUN ALL NIGHT marks the third collaboration between star Liam Neeson and director Jaume Collet-Serra; their previous movies were the disappointing UNKNOWN and the above-average NON-STOP. RUN ALL NIGHT falls somewhere in the middle of those two films in terms of quality; it's a good enough mob thriller although not quite good enough to be considered a classic or indeed a regular watch. The film's very familiarity is what works against it throughout. Neeson and his adult son, played by Joel Kinnaman, are forced to go on the run from mob boss Ed Harris when things go bad, and the film follows the situation from there. It's set over a single night, which gives it some fun, but the story has been done before and done better, for example in Sam Mendes' ROAD TO PERDITION.",/review/rw3200965/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2018,Coventry,7," Liam Neesploitation!
","Few things in the present-day cinema business are as fascinating and remarkable as the sudden career change that Liam Neeson underwent since 2008! The charismatic Irish born actor has always been a tough guy, at least from the looks of it, but nevertheless he was mainly known and celebrated for his weighty and highbrowed roles, like in ""Schindler's List"", ""Michael Collins"" or ""Les Misérables"". But since 2008, with the release of the first ""Taken"", Neeson seems reborn as a hardcore-to-the-bone and authentically unhinged action hero! The ""Taken"" sequels, and other similarly themed and equally fast-paced action movies (like ""Unknown"", ""Non-Stop"" and ""The Grey""), followed so quickly in the next ten years that we can now even almost speak of a spontaneous new sub-genre: Liam Neesploitation! ""Run All Night"", Neeson's third collaboration with director Jaume Collet-Serra in a row, is easily his best since the original ""Taken"", and it takes our protagonist back to his roots by depicting a heavy-drinking and embittered Irish ex-gangster. What makes the film even cooler is that Neeson is now surrounded by equally embittered compeers, like the underrated Vincent D'Onofrio, the sadly forgotten Bruce McGill and the always phenomenal Ed Harris. The difference between these old & experienced veterans and an ensemble cast existing of young hunks is that you genuinely believe them if they act like they don't care if they are going to die or not! Neeson is terrific as the emotionally tormented former hit man Jimmy Conlon, with real agony in his eyes and voice. Certain circumstances force him to kill the son of his best friend and patron Shawn Maguire, and the latter now swears that he's ""coming after Jimmy's son Mike with everything he's got"". Sit back and enjoy the wild mixture of car chases, virulent shootouts and raw duels.",/review/rw3200965/?ref_=tt_urv

",I will first start off by saying do not listen to a word these dumb reviews are saying especially the so-called professional men and women from newspaper company's and etc because they have no idea what they are talking about at all. I absolutely loved this movie from beginning to end it was a highly action oriented film and in my opinion Liam Neeson's best to date beating out both Taken and Non-Stop both of which I own and have seen. The story is simple which makes it easy to follow. I also loved that there are a few scenes where Liam has some very dry humor that made me laugh. The action was Top Notch and continuous for about a good hour and twenty minutes out of a two hour movie. The other actors were Superb including Ed Harris who is always Awesome as well as Joel Kinnaman who did Fantastic. Common rocked as a Hit-man. The movie had great closure and I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves Liam Neeson's movies and even if you are tired of them I feel it's well worth it.,/review/rw3200965/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2015,Aodhanrooney,8," One of Liam Neeson's finest!
","Liam Neeson plays retired hit-man, James Conlon, and it's one of the finest roles he's played in years with a great performance, and with additional superb acting from Joel Kinnaman, whom plays his son, Mike Conlon. The first 'Taken' may have turned out great, until it launched a franchise, but 'Run All Night' is a definite improvement over Neeson's latest work, and a major improvement over clichéd action movies released in the past decade. What makes it so good, is that Neeson brings company with him: his co-star Kinnaman who plays his son - and it's a different movie experience altogether as in most clichéd action thrillers the main protagonist, usually played by a familiar action star, is usually without company the whole way through. The character James Conlon is so similar to Jimmy Bobo, a part Sylvester Stallone played in a movie called 'Bullet to the Head'. Jimmy Bobo was an ageing hit-man who still made hits on assignments, but compared to Conlon, he's more emotionless and merciless. Neeson's Conlon still had good in his heart somewhere, whereas Bobo cared more about killing and seeking vengeance. However, the action sequences are enjoyable and thrilling, acting is great and the direction and screen writing becomes intriguing whenever the main plot kicks in - so Run All Night has what it takes of being one of the most exciting movies of the year!",/review/rw3200965/?ref_=tt_urv
