31 January 2022,Prismark10,7," The Tragedy of Macbeth
",Joel Coen brings a low key Macbeth. It is shot in black and white with minimum staging. There is some clever use of special effects and CGI.,/review/rw7759170/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2022,darkreignn,5," Nothing new
","The story of Macbeth is a classic one, told time and time and time again. You've probably seen the 1971 Roman Polanski adaption; you may have even seen the 2016 version starring the one and only Michael Fassbender - in short, you know the tale, and you know the tragedy of one Macbeth. So on a very surface level, you know that with Joel Coen's ""The Tragedy of Macbeth,"" you're not necessarily getting anything new.",/review/rw7759170/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2022,evanston_dad,8," Gorgeous Looking Version of Shakespeare's Darkest Play
","I'm usually not a huge fan of Shakespeare on screen, but ""Macbeth"" is my favorite Shakespeare play, so that combined with my curiosity about what Joel Coen would do with the material drew me to see this one. It's really good, and it fully embraces what I like best about the play, its twisted and macabre aesthetic. Coen goes all in on atmosphere, and this has to be one of the most gorgeous looking movies released this year. Rather than try to open up the work for the screen, he instead goes the opposite direction, making this film look purposefully artificial, like it's being performed on the grandest of theater stages.",/review/rw7759170/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2022,UniqueParticle,9," Complex dialogue but very well made by Joel Coen
",I didn't realize how brilliant this play/story is as complicated as the bulk is it's extraordinarily made and flows well. My mom couldn't finish cause she didn't understand it that's kinda fair the performances are phenomenal and cinematography is perfect! Well deserving of the award nominations. I'm not sure what else to say except The Tragedy of Macbeth is glorious in thy presentation!,/review/rw7759170/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,Kirpianuscus,," new Macbeth
","The premises remains what can expect from a new version of Macbeth. Sure, for me, to see Denzel Washington, Frances McDormand or Brendan Gleeson in the roles who I know. To discover the vision of Joel Coen about the Shakespeare's play . To expect , in fact, nothing , because what can be said was , in wise, brilliant and precise manner said by previous adaptations ?",/review/rw7759170/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2022,Tweetienator,5," Strong Visuals
","The Tragedy of Macbeth got a well working cast, some beautiful and interesting scenes shot in black and white, and I like the very reduced sound design and settings, but somewhat watching I wasn't too enchanted and entertained. I read Macbeth quite a few times and I dare to say I watched almost all movie adaptions (and some more than just a few times), so maybe I am just tired of the story, the material itself. The movie got without doubt some merits and tried something new but Roman Polanski's (1971) and Orson Well's (1948) adaptions are in my opinion unchallenged by this one. I would also prefer to put Macbeth starring Michael Fassbender (2015) again on my screen instead of this one. For sure the strongest part of Coen's work are the visuals but that's more or less what will have some lasting impressions on me - so if you want some Macbeth in the gestalt of a more or less theatrical performance, you may give this one a try.",/review/rw7759170/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,sumtim3s00n,3," Style Over Substance
","I have to say Im beginning having trouble distinguishing between these artsy films the last couple of years because so many use the same portrayal and cinematography. Bleak, minimalistic scenes, often used black/white portrayals, filled with ""symbolism"" and ""methaphores"" that are either so plain and on the nose its sad or only understood by the creator.",/review/rw7759170/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,MOscarbradley,10," One of the greatest of all filmed Shakespeare's.
","Do we really need another version of 'Macbeth' so soon after the debacle that was the Kurzel/Fassbender version, (some people praising it to the heights; others, like me, hating it), but then this is Joel Coen's ""Macbeth"" or ""The Tragedy of Macbeth"" to give it its full title, so should we expect a medieval ""Blood Simple"" or perhaps even a Big Mac, (and that's probably not the last time you'll hear that attempt at a gag)? Well, Coen's version, (sans brother Ethan), is certainly different but then we always knew that it would be; abridged, shot in black and white by the great Bruno Delbonnel and in the Academy ratio, in what, if this were the theatre, you might call a blank stage and it's magnificent.",/review/rw7759170/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2021,ferguson-6,7," sound and fury
","Greetings again from the darkness. The confounding part about screen adaptions of great and familiar literary works is that we have each already formed our mental images of characters and setting. Adapting Shakespeare's 400 year old play is Joel Coen (4 time Oscar winner, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), and it's also his first time to fly solo as director without his brother Ethan. Filmed in black and white on a sound stage, this production may lack the frills we've come to expect in modern times, yet while its stark sets recall German Expressionism, the film still manage to deliver memorable visuals.",/review/rw7759170/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2022,Danusha_Goska,2," Fantastic to Look At; Boring with Nothing to Say on Its Themes
","Macbeth is about toxic ambition. A man becomes willing to commit multiple, unjust murders to slake his lust for the crown. He meets an unsurprising fate. His wife eggs him on. I think anyone watching this knows this plot and so you watch a new adaptation to see something new.",/review/rw7759170/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2022,boblipton,10," Your Great-Great-Grandfather Is Not Your Cousin
","To discuss Joel Coen's edited and directed version of Shakespeare's most quoted play -- every two lines has been plundered for at least three titles -- is a waste of time. Let it stand that Denzell Washington makes a fine MacBeth, Frances McDormand a fine Lady MacBeth, and that Coen and cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel have shot a fine, spooky black-and-white story of a man struggling against his fate, full of fog and expressionism, Dutch angles and angst.",/review/rw7759170/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2022,jdesando,," A classy contribution to the best movie of the year.
","Joel Coen, sans brother Ethan after about eighteen collaborative ventures, triumphs with his new Tragedy of Macbeth. Coen keeps essential lines (it is Shakespeare's shortest play anyway) and doesn't let the magnificent set design overpower the first-rate performances.",/review/rw7759170/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2022,djurrepower,5," pfff
","Certainly not an easy watch. Knowing the many macbeth films that exist there certainly seems to be a trend of art over substance. Say what you will of the artistic side of this film, but overall I would descibe it as methodical. It's certainly a niche, wich honestly I wouldn't reccomend to most people. All in all, pretty good film, but not for the your standard watching experience.",/review/rw7759170/?ref_=tt_urv

","I Love Macbeth, but I didn't like this. I Struggled with the American/English in and out accents....especially of the leads and SOME cast members. Unimpressed. I'm a fan of Coen, Washington and McDormand but it was, for me sadly miscast. Disappointed and surprised by the acting nominations.",/review/rw7759170/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2021,johnpercival-66006,8," Amazing cinematography
","BFI London Film Festival The Tragedy Of Macbeth shows that Joel Coen can do it alone without his brother. This film is nothing short of spectacular, some of the greatest cinematography I've probably ever seen, the monochrome adds even more beauty to such a well shot film too, I could compare the cinematography to some of the greats of cinema like Bergman. Denzel Washington kills his role as Macbeth, showing how diverse his acting skills can go, he's almost a completely different person, I would have never imagined him doing old English speech, but we go it, and he doesn't mess it up at all, his emotions shot in the 4:3 aspect ratio is tremendous, once again leaving the cinema wanting every film to be shot in it.",/review/rw7759170/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2021,subxerogravity,8," Not into Shakespeare but love me some Denzel.
","Give Joel Coen the credit. What he succeeded in doing is adapting the play into a very basic movie. He could have taped the play and tried to pass it off as a movie, but what he did was take the play and transformed it into a film at its raw.",/review/rw7759170/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2022,madanmarwah,7," A sincerely made movie on a classic play
","I am not particularly fond of photographed stage plays because there is an extensive use of the static camera which I don't like much. As expected the movie has a fair share of long shots, long duration shots and scenes with extended dialogue. This movie based on a celebrated play of Shakespeare will be appreciated by English literature loving people and discriminating audiences. The dialogue as far as I could make out is original stuff and though sitting through the serious scenes was quite challenging, it took me back to school days when the characters uttered the following famous quotes.",/review/rw7759170/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,Neptune165,5," Everybody wants to destroy the History?
","Shakespeare without pure british accents? Come on Denzel! Give me a break. No respect for the unique heritage of unique people. This plays like a vanity project, not telling a story. Certain actors don't even attempt the right accents for the location of MacBeth. So I can only conclude this is about actors showing how dramatically they can recite Shakespeare's lines and not about making the audience believe what they are seeing. World and life were always with colours. B&W and 4:3 format were the technology constraints of time, not something desirable. No doubt, directors and actors created masterpieces in B&W. But that is it. Why waste fine actors, story, script and locations now on obsolescence. The sets were pretty bad in this version. Hurt the movie/story. Let's be real it is historically inaccurate as there would have never had been a black king at that time in Scotland , but artistically speaking I think it's fine being this is a very stylish German expressionist interpretation of an 11th century Scottish warlord. And Denzel is an amazing actor. Plus I think the guy was being sarcastic.",/review/rw7759170/?ref_=tt_urv
