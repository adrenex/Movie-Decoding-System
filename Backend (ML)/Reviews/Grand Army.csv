5 December 2021,Advocate1,10," Solid Show, Ready 4 Season 2
","Great writing, Great Acting, Real life stories. The creative team has done an a amazing job with this show. I've watched all episodes and thought episode 7 was the best, until I saw episode 8. Can't wait to see how it ends.",/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,felixnkubi,10," this show is really dope
",Am not a fan of basketball but for this show I am! Episode 1 was a bit shaky for me but the rest just cemented it!,/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2021,mcogolfer,9," More real than you might know!
","I operate in the world of elite grassroots basketball (formerly pure AAU) on both the girls and boys side, and the storylines are VERY accurate. Don't get me wrong, nobody is going to win an award for their acting in this. However, they're very believable, and the basketball is actually watchable. That aside, the way these stories are developing is 100% accurate - unscrupulous coaches who forget the kids they're coaching AND COACHING AGAINST are just kids, the way people don't pay enough attention to girls basketball, parents who have put an ""I"" in team somehow, and most importantly the reliance on social media for affirmation and it's affect on the psyche of our youth.",/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2021,futuristicmikec,10," Very good show
","I love basketball as it is, and I love watching shows about it. This is a really good show so far and I only watched the first episode. I'm about to watch the next 2, but it's worth the watch.",/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2021,marymacbookpals-2,10," Excellent Series!
",Strong series! Great acting with a full and meaningful storyline. There are several mini stories going on at the same time to keep the ball rolling. Can't wait for the next episode.,/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2021,domenicg-83697,10," Great Show
",I don't know why anyone would give this a negative review the show is about basketball. If you like that sport then it's a 10. If your not into that then I suggest you watch something else.,/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2021,Prophetik,9," Great Show + Good Actors
","Reminds me of when i played ball back in AAU and YMCA and got second place the year i played so very nostalgic & realistic but it Has Oshea Jackson JR a great actor, Felicia Pearson who played ""Snoop"" on the show "" The Wire "" and also Tristan Wilds who played ""Micheal"" in the same show too. Overall a good show with a good story. Love the intro song & Can't wait for season 2!",/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,lamelody,9," Great Show!
","It's is a look into the life of young hoopers on the day to day. The ups, downs, highs and lows of living in the inner city without resources but with talent and a dream. I love the characters and the music is on point! I can't wait to see MORE!!!",/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2021,tinarutar,10," My family is hooked!
","The series goes far beyond basketball. Interwoven story lines explore the themes facing youth growing up in urban Baltimore - like racial profiling, abuse, poverty. We are enjoying watching this with our tween age kids!",/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2021,silindilemalinga,10," Love this series
",Great storyline and cast. Praying for the series to experience acceleration growth for future seasons. Keep up the great work. The authenticity in the characters from scipt to body language. Basketball at the center but storyline shows the realities of the in betweens of life.,/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2021,tan1415,10," One of the best series this season...
",Wow wow. Didn't know what to expect.,/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2021,marflaker,10," Love this Show!
","I stumbled on this show one night looking for something to watch and I am glad that I did. It is one of my favorite shows in a long time. It has great characters and a great story line! It follows the life of up and coming basketball stars and the trials and tribulations of real life. Some may not like the political side, but it looks a lot like what is going on in today's world. It is very relevant to our times and what many kids of color go through on a daily basis. I love the relationships among the players and the coach with his players. I absolutely love the actors; they fill the rolls perfectly.",/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,ichennsun,9," Feels natural and real
","The biggest strength of the show is how real it feels about a real mid class black family and the schoolmates / community. The look on their face, the talk they have, the cars they drive, the places they visit, the houses they live in are all real for me. I get goose bumps, laughters, and tears watching these things.",/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,edichow,4," Over the Top, Lacklustre Performances
","Shot really well like many Apple TV shows, but the script writing is really bad and pretentious.",/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2021,einsamer_boy,4," Not good.
",Apple series again. Successful from the outside and very promising.,/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2021,dneese-70208,10," Just Excellent for Family Viewing
",It's a wonderful show that could be watched as a family children as there are so many relevant and teachable moments throughout. I anxiously await Season 2.,/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2022,legacy_kellz,10," Unexpectedly GREAT
",To be honest I didn't know what to expect when I came across this show but I gave it a shot and I'm pleased that I did. All around Great actors chosen to play key roles with an amazing storyline. I really hope there's second season because I'm looking forward to it.,/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2021,tiffanyrdow,2," Nothing but condescending pandering.
",It feels like the show is completely comprised of things they THINK we want to see. It's embarrassing and patronizing. The acting leaves something to be desired and the plot lines are predictable every time. Don't waste your time.,/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2022,markoilicic,9," Really good and intelligent show
",Really educational show with a lot of tough situations that kids have to face and how friendships through sports can help them. I wish that all kids have coaches that are invested and supporting.,/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2021,igibuek,7," Good - but Too much Woke don't keep me Awake
","This show could be so so good but it centres too much on race and political correctness
Show life as it is, not how you think we want to see it.",/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,luvleme1,10," I LOVE this
","I'm not a big sport person but to see this and the casts puls me in. I love the coach and the main player and the retrospect of the known personality. Mad respect for everything endured and this is proof, a person is not a product/result of their envionnment; the choices are our own and we MUST make the best of it. LOVE-LOVE it and need more seasons. PULEESE!!",/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2021,brownsugar217,4," Disappointing
","This show is supposed to be set in the Seat Pleasant, Md area of the DMV. None of the neighborhoods look anything like the PG County area! I also found it annoying that NO ONE studied the DMV accent. As someone who is DC born & bred, we have a very distinct accent which is native to our area. These kids sound like they're from Connecticut. I also think that the actress playing Jace's mother is a miscast. She looks nothing like him or his sister. All in all, this could've been a two hour movie instead, it's a stretched out series full of a lot of filler scenes.",/review/rw7569290/?ref_=tt_urv
