20 July 2020,melodyso,10," You will find a piece of you
","To be honest, coming into this I didn't realise it is such a great show. Maybe because of the cliche name or the old school poster art. I thought it was gonna be one of those cheesy rom-com.",/review/rw5814460/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2020,blanbrn,8," Fun, funny upbeat romance like comedy that's shows life and love is complex and changes!
","""Love Life"" the new romance anthology from ""HBO Max"" is a little series that's entertaining as it tries to capture the present day journey and trials of love and life of one Darby(the good Anna Kendrick) a ""NYC"" millennial who as a single girl in the big city has fun as she explores the bedroom with different loves, as her relationships are fun yet messy. Really the series is a take on the highs and lows of life and love. Darby and her friends are still trying to figure out life and dreams, as Darby has somewhat had the cards stacked against her after being a child of divorced parents. She also struggles in the job world often changing jobs as much as boyfriends. Each episode moves forward following a new love in the life of Darby, as always love hurts as it's complex and tough. Still despite the relationship drama the series is fun, soul searching and entertaining.",/review/rw5814460/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2020,Short_and_to_the_point,6," It was okay. The ending though >:(
","The main character Darby was kind of boring. I feel like Anna didn't really fit the bill for the character. The show was good, though. A great show to turn off your brain and not have to think too much.
Now let's talk about the ending. The whole show was based on Darby finding love and her soul mate. There were so many episodes where we really got to know the men she was dating. We knew everything about them and got to form opinions on them. Then when she finally finds ""her person,"" we see about 5 minutes of him. We didn't see any real personality, nor did we get to see her interact in a romantic way with him. It was incredibly frustrating and quite a let down at the end. Didn't like it at all.",/review/rw5814460/?ref_=tt_urv

",Yogi was the best character and deserves his own spin off show!,/review/rw5814460/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2020,Eggoreluckadman,7," Not revolutionary, but enjoyable
","The pacing is off and there's some cringy jokes and storylines, but Anna Kendrick and her character's romantic journey provides a solid but flawed television series.",/review/rw5814460/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2020,gallagherkellie,6," Not bad but went downhill
","The first few episodes reeled me in. I could relate being a single girl living in the city. I thought it would be a funny or quirky different guy story each episode but it changed halfway through and became more dramatic.
It also became a bit less relatable in that her career was just falling into place and she would meet men so easily - I mean seriously a tall dark handsome man is all into her right after she's had a baby, has leaking boobs and was kinda rude to him at first?
But all in all it was entertaining and easy to watch.",/review/rw5814460/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2020,amcc9,7," Sad funny awkward
",This is a good show. Great characters who are relatable. Gives a snapshot of each relationship Darby (Anna Kendrick) attempts to make work. Her teen years episode was great but so hard to watch! This is well done. Ignore the haters not sure what they expected.,/review/rw5814460/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2021,ameesha-green,5," Started well, went downhill, cliched ending
","I wouldn't normally watch a romantic drama TV show, but I'm a big Anna Kendrick fan so I gave it a go.",/review/rw5814460/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2020,gingerbread-04494,7," Somewhat entertaining, though definitely below typical HBO caliber
","This series follows the chronological love life of a 20-something in NYC, played by Anna Kendrick, with each episode focusing on a different relationship.
It's entertaining enough, and luckily the episodes aren't too long (30 mins) but honestly it's nothing to write home about. It doesn't say anything particularly unique or thought-provoking about love, nor is it particularly funny.
Though I've liked Anna Kendrick in other productions, personally she doesn't do it for me here. For a show that's entirely centered on its main character, the main character is kinda bland and a little annoying.",/review/rw5814460/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2020,jillianc221,7," Started Great, then wavered
","I really liked the concept of this. As a woman who dated in New York for over a decade until I found the right person (in LA), there are definitely a multitude of different situations and types of guys this could have covered to show how hard dating in NY can be. The first few episodes were great, but once it strayed from the original concept it just became a different slightly less interesting show. Where are all the terrible Tinder dates, or guy who turns out to be married, etc. So many missed story ops. On a side note Anna Kendrick's clothing in this is beautiful, but there's no way that character could afford most of it.",/review/rw5814460/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2020,dvdandre,1," i love Anna Kendrick but...
","Anna Kendrick is very talented and lifts up everything she's in. In 'Love Life' she basically has to carry the whole show - the supporting cast is so miscast that I just can't fathom what's going on in the drawing office!!!! there are a few save themselves eg. Augie (Jin Ha).
this is so utterly boring, you just end up leaving the tv on and doing other things (you'll see!!). the time skip nature of the tv show is lazy writing and disengages the audience. we just don't care what the character was like as a teenager (filler episode with one of the writers wanting to get ""a story"" produced. I'm also sorry for Anna's character and hope Kendrick doesn't get painted with the same promiscuous brush as her character.
the show could do with some real writing/real directors. give it a miss",/review/rw5814460/?ref_=tt_urv

28 July 2020,Piltil,9," Just...real
","Give this one star or ten stars, it does not matter. But if you have the patience to just watch, and you are a real person, this has something. Thank you for making this",/review/rw5814460/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2020,krisztinaobrien,6," Glitzy Hollywood twenty something lonelines
","The concept of this series is not bad, modern coming of age Experiences here, in lack of films like Breakfast Cub or St Elmo we shall welcome adulthood exploration. But why its happening in a tribeca NYC apartment, AK wearing Designer clothes she could never afford? And meeting incredible unfit/ugly and old men to make this tale real? Giving it a grit this way is a joke. This adaptation of twentysomething loneliness wont get real with a narrator, trying to give depth to shallowness. Sara is the only believable character.",/review/rw5814460/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2021,nancyldraper,7," It grew in me
","This is an American version of a UK dramedy. It took me the whole of the first season to decide whether I liked this or not. I decided I did, almost solely on the discovery that Anna Kendrick has some serious dramatic chops. (I'd only seen her in acerbic comedic roles until now.). The writing is rather brutal, unflattering and crass but every once in a while it hits a profound note (but not nearly often enough). I give this first season a 7 (good) out of 10. {Slice of Life Drama}",/review/rw5814460/?ref_=tt_urv

28 May 2020,fleck05IMDB,3," Nothing to get excited over
","It feels like it could be one of the Modern Love stories on Amazon. I managed to get through one episode, but it felt like I was enduring it, not enjoying it. The problem is probably more mine than the show... I've been happily married for a couple decades so it's hard for me to relate to these characters. I find them whiny, entitled, foul-mouthed Announce dc and in situations that don't I don't care how they end up.",/review/rw5814460/?ref_=tt_urv

10 June 2020,evrivali,," Amazing show
","I am not much of a TV series person, I usually prefer movies but I decided to give this one a shot since Anna Kendrick is one of my favourite actresses out there. I saw the first episode and I thought it was okay, nothing particularly exciting, just a chill rom com but right now I am absolutely hooked. After watching every episode so far I can confidently say that this is a great TV show with great acting and plot. I am not biased, when an actor/actress I love does a bad job I'll be the first to acknowledge it so believe me when I say that Anna Kendrick shines with a hilarious yet partially heart breaking performance and she's a reason alone to watch this. The script is also very interesting with many ups and downs (emotionally speaking) and I am thrilled every time an episode comes out. If you are looking for something relaxing and entertaining to watch this show is for you. If you want something more exciting then you might not be particularly thrilled about this but I think it's still worth watching. Definitely recommended.",/review/rw5814460/?ref_=tt_urv
