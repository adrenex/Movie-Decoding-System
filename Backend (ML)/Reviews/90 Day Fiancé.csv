7 October 2020,siderite,8," An uncomfortable dissection of human nature
","This film is about how nasty we can be while hiding behind things like authority, law and other euphemisms for power. A slow burn movie, it stars Mark Rylance - in a yet another great role - as a decent man who has no power to control things, but has to observe others. I will have to say that both Johnny Depp and Robert Pattinson did a great job, but their characters barely covered ten minutes of screen taken together. The film is well done, beautifully shot, introspective.",/review/rw5982440/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2020,joebloggscity,7," Coetzee eye-view on the blurring of morality
","JM Coetzee is the author of the original book, and is rightly lauded for his story telling ability as much as his literary ability. However, his works haven't easily transferred to screen, which is not uncommon for high-end literary works. This one to me is borderline.",/review/rw5982440/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2020,ferguson-6,6," Pain is truth
","Greetings again from the darkness. Nobel Prize winning author J.M. Coetzee's revered novel was first published in 1980, and renowned composer Philip Glass later adapted the South African writer's work into a 2005 opera. It's a fascinating piece of literature that, on the surface, doesn't lend itself easily to the silver screen. Perhaps it works because Mr. Coetzee wrote the screenplay himself, and rising star director Cirro Guerra brings it to life. Mr. Guerra's two most recent films were both excellent: BIRDS OF PASSAGE (2018) and EMBRACE OF THE SERPENT (2015).",/review/rw5982440/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2021,CelluloidDog,9," Artful Mythical Work
","Many masterpieces are recognized well after they come and go. Van Gogh sold only a few paintings in his life. No, this isn't a masterpiece of Van Gogh statue, and won't be the of the 2-3 best films of the year, but it is one of the finer drama films in the past several years. And the novel by Nobel Prize winner Coetzee should be seen as a superior gem. However, this film is a gem in its own rights. Beautifully acted by Mark Rylance, Johnny Depp and Robert Pattinson, this film is mythical and timeless as a study of human nature, power, imperialism, and how conquerors dehumanize and how resistance forms. It is filmed in Morroco and is namelessly fictitious in its thematic treatment of the subject. Cinematography and film score are beautiful. Unfortunately, critics today are a bit shallow and people need increasing stimulation and this film does not meet those expectations. As other people may say, it is a slow burn into myth. But very worth seeing for mature audiences who appreciate philosophical interpretations of human nature and conquest. Actual rating 8.5 or the type of film which is a minor masterpiece deserving to win a few awards at lesser film festivals.",/review/rw5982440/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2020,deloudelouvain,6," Slow paced but with excellent acting.
","Although the cinematography and the acting are almost excellent the slow pace of the story makes Waiting For The Barbarians just a movie that is worth watching once but not more. It just lacks some oomph, maybe some battle scenes to make it better. There is some cruelty and torturing though, physical and mental torture, so the story is still captivating and the excellent acting of Mark Rylance is the best thing of the movie. Johnny Depp and Robert Pattinson are for once the bad people, and they did a very good job playing characters that everybody normal will dislike. All in all it isn't a bad movie but it clearly misses something to make it exceptional.",/review/rw5982440/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2020,Kirpianuscus,," decent
","I expected the film with...fear. Because each adaptation of a great novel remains a try . Because the characters and the atmosphere are more posessions of reader than work of the writer . But the film is decent . Grace to cinematography , reasonable solutions for inner monologue of Magister and, no doubts, for the admirable work of Mark Rylance and Greta Scacchi. And, sure, for not bad Colonel Joll proposed by Johnny Depp. Moments of novel are fresh, the intro is just beautiful and it works, maybe better than as adaptation, like a colonial story. And the barbarians as Mongols remains an inspired solution. In my case, only two surprises - the absence of generous belly of Magister and his so large office. But , obvious, it is a reasonable adaptation. So, just decent.",/review/rw5982440/?ref_=tt_urv

23 September 2020,TxMike,," We see who the real Barbarians are here.
","After seeing this movie I am not sure what to make of it. If there is some specific lesson to learn then it escapes me. It is a fictional time and place but the ""refined"" people seem very much like the British who, over the past centuries, established remote outposts and viewed themselves as superior rulers over the common indigenous peoples. The ""barbarians"" here appear to be Mongolians, and the landscape looks like Mongolia, but it was filmed in Morocco.",/review/rw5982440/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2020,EdgarST,10," A Masterwork
","«Waiting for the Barbarians» is an impressive work! Could it be that the 2020 pandemic has had such a devastating effect on audiences that they have not been able to fairly rate this great movie? Or perhaps, it is because the global tragedy has had profound repercussions and this tale of hopelessness and pain affects viewers in a subliminal way, unrelated to aesthetic appreciation. The film, without a doubt, confronts you, with its story about power, about the military machine, about oppression and about little people who suffer it all, but who can turn monstrous when the time comes.",/review/rw5982440/?ref_=tt_urv

8 August 2020,butskhrikidze,4," Really really good, slow burn
","For start waiting for barbarians opens in a best way possible, it doesn't rush anything, makes you intresting from the very beggining, while maintaining the pace. As the story goes on it gets more and more dramatic. Visualy the movie is very well shot, it looks beautiful and has purpose, which unfortunately is rear nowadays, overall cinematography is amazing, score is really good too, acting, for start Robert Pattinson and Johnny Depp have supporting roles but they performed them very well, leading actor, Mark Rylance has lots of acting to do, he is the main source of emotions and in this movie Rylance is just great. There's another character played by Gana Bayarsaikhan who also needs to be very emotional, that is the performance that really stole the show. Overall directing, including working with the actors, storytelling and so on, is 10/10, fantastic.",/review/rw5982440/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2020,lukebohn,6," Strong performances save ""Waiting for the Barbarians""
","Waiting for the Barbarians is a film directed by Ciro Guerra, and stars Mark Rylance, Johnny Depp, and Robert Pattinson. This is a historical drama where Mark Rylance plays the magistrate for this fortress on the frontier of the ""Empire"". There is no date or location given, and not even a name for the so-called ""empire"". This is because the main theme deals heavily with imperialism, and the mistreatment that has gone on in almost every example of it. Johnny Depp and Robert Pattinson are the ""bad"" guys checking up on the frontier, and trying to handle the barbarians. Now that we have simple routine out of the way, let me describe how I personally thought this movie was.
This film has very important themes, and strong performances, but struggles to really keep your attention. The movie starts off pretty strong, with this rivalry between Johnny Depp (who is brilliant in this by the way), and Mark Rylance. It was highly entertaining to see their ideology duel and it looked like it was going somewhere. However, then we get to the long second act where it basically takes too long at everything. Also, there is no Johnny Depp, or any interesting characters or plot really. Mark Rylance is good, but his character is just wimpy, and not charismatic. He is just utterly weak in almost every sense. He is also kinda creepy with his weird foot fetish scenes (you will know when you see them). It finally picks up in the third half which is carried by Robert Pattinson and Johnny Depp. This isn't because Mark Rylance is bad, but his character on his own is just extremely boring. Everytime Robert or Johnny was on screen, it was very entertaining. I just feel they made Mark's character way more interesting. Besides seldom clunky moments, the acting is pretty good.
The actual story is kinda interesting, but I feel we have seen it done in a more entertaining fashion. Don't get me wrong, i'm not saying I wanted more action in this movie, I just felt like more conflict was needed especially in the second act. The themes are very important, and it does a good job of showing it (imperialism is bad). The cinematography was okay, it just didn't have a lot of ""wow"" moments. The soundtrack also didn't strike me much, but was okay. Honestly, if this film didn't have Johnny or Robert, I don't think I would have liked it nearly as much. In the end it is an okay film, but ultimately suffers from being kinda boring the whole second act. I will say that the Johnny Depp and Robert Pattinson performances are worth it in the end. I would recommend renting this movie despite its shortcomings.",/review/rw5982440/?ref_=tt_urv

8 August 2020,tarmer1,10," Watch If you like Spectacular Acting and thoughtful storytelling
","Mark Rylance's performance in this film makes it well worth watching. The film is not your typical fast paced Superhero action film that people are so used to today. The film has a Lawrence if Arabia-esque setting and is thoughtfully directed like films of that era. Director Ciro Guerra takes his time and allows the actors to carry the film.

30 November 2020,PyroSikTh,8," A Film About Perspective
","The film is about as anti-imperialist/anti-colonialist as you can get, pitching us in with the Magistrate. Put in charge of a minor settlement on the frontier of an unnamed empire, he's enjoyed relative peace alongside the neighbouring nomadic tribes who have no qualms with coming to the town for medical aid. He's a fair, well-meaning man, but lacks in charisma and strength as much as he gains in perspective and a sense of justice. The arrival of Colonel Joll, hell-bent on quashing the resistance of so-called barbarians, shakes up the status quo. His torturous methods put him on the bad side of both the Magistrate and the neighbouring nomadic tribes.",/review/rw5982440/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2019,catherines_uk,8," Colonialism then and now
","Set in the 19th century in an unnamed Asian frontier post, this story describes how imperialism and colonialism disrupts the lives of ordinary people.
Mark Rylance is the magistrate of a peaceful settlement where the biggest crime is a pig invading a neighbour's garden brilliantly acting an excellent script based in a prize winning novel,.
Johnny Depp is the sinister policeman from the capital who suspects a rebellion and uses torture to get ""confessions""
A young nomadic girl who is a victim is befriended by the magistrate.
The story is well told and the scenery spectacular- deserts and mountains.
What is very well done by this film set in the past is that the methods of the policeman, the attitude of the empire , and the whole issue or race and occupation are as relevant today , and this is an allegory of what is happening in the Middle East, the Congo and elsewhere at this very moment.",/review/rw5982440/?ref_=tt_urv

","Preface: Empires have existed -- and done so everywhere -- ever since human got out of hunter gather phase. Vast, oppressive, slaving, hyper violent empires have existed and run by natives of east Asia, Central America, the Middle East, Africa and even withing Polynesian island groups, as well as Europe, going back many millennia. So approach Waiting for the Barbarians, as a universal theme.

26 October 2020,classicsoncall,7," ""Pain is truth. All else is subject to doubt.""
","The film has all the look and feel of an indictment on British colonialism, even if the subject location is unknown and the reigning authority is unidentified. The story quickly gets to the point that the barbarians one is waiting for are the colonial soldiers dispatched to quell a supposedly nomadic uprising by an indigenous people with no means to fight a war. Johnny Depp turns in another off kilter performance, not as flamboyant say as a Jack Sparrow, but bizarre enough to qualify as one of his numerous oddball characterizations. Mark Rylance portrays the magistrate of a desert outpost who wisely rules as a humanist in a live and let live manner, recognizing that leaving well enough alone is the only sane way to conduct affairs when the potential opposition can become deadly upon a moments' notice. It takes a while to get to that point, and in the meantime, the magistrate evokes the imagery of a humble Jesus washing the feet and tending to the depradations of a nomad woman savagely beaten by her captors. He maintains a stoic and dignified manner, even while being charged with treasonously consorting with the desert barbarians. My favorite scene was where the magistrate made up the story to go with the slips of carved ancient writing, only to invite further wrath from a nominal superior. Because the story was fictional, it left me with an empty feeling at the end. There was also the dubious continuity of the seasons during which the story took place, as it proceeded in order from summer to winter, and then from spring to autumn. Better if that were not even mentioned, as the look of the desert locale didn't change at all.",/review/rw5982440/?ref_=tt_urv

11 August 2020,nnmbrookes,8," Dazzling star burst that is the acting performances
","Draw your gaze away from the dazzling star burst that is the acting performances of the three lead roles-Rylance,Depp and Pattinson. In the shadows you will find the outstanding performances of a large number of not so famous actors. 'The Girl' (Gana Bayarsaikhan) who sucks empathy from the audience, barely saying a word. The Barbarian leader to whom she is returned, almost thinking aloud "" so you steal,torture maime and return her, blind and disabled to our 'survive if you can world'.............and you're waiting for thanks?!!"". Even the children give up exceptionally skilled performances. Harry Melling (Dudley Dursley of Harry Potter films) looks suitably terrified of siding with the wrong boss. Tries to playdown the atrocities so as not to besmirch his superiors. Wonderful performance.
If you're tired of the normal Hollywood fare and crave a little brain food you may just love this film.",/review/rw5982440/?ref_=tt_urv
