24 March 2015,mardikas777,1," Why are the most intimate moments of peoples' lives on public TV?
","I mean, I get that it's their choice, but I still feel like a pervert when I see footage from a camera that is recording, say, some couple's struggle with their first time having sex. I keep thinking that the main reason for the awkwardness of many situations in the show is because there is a ******* camera present. My viewpoint is strongly biased, because I am editing subtitles for the show, which means it's not my choice to see this thing. I'm seeing it because I have to. I felt the urge to let it be known what I think of the show - not because of the people that it shows, I have nothing against people who get married like that, nothing against interracial marriages, nothing against taking risks in one's love life. What I have a problem with is the fact that there exists a show that takes something that's in my mind supposed to be extremely private, intimate and special, and makes it a reality TV product with all its exaggerations and needless problematizations. And who in their right mind would let a camera in their bedroom... ever? Damn, it pisses me off...",/review/rw2969016/?ref_=tt_urv

",I've been watching this show 90-day fiance from day one. I used to be a very good show to watch not anymore. If a man abused a woman verbally the way Angela has abused her husband it wouldn't be tolerated.

30 October 2017,fdgrazie,6," As a person married 10 yrs from overseas romance, torn about show
","My husband is from a very small village in Italy. We have been together over 10 years, lived in both countries, and gone through the excruciating visa and immigration processes. We found this show very late into it; we've been busy between countries. There are some very good things about this show that could be helpful if it was done in a much better way. These young people were never meant to make it in almost every circumstance because they weren't helped by anyone in how to navigate something so difficult. This really hurts people like my husband and myself. If you go on visajourney, you can read many couples together years going through this and having difficulties due to the ignorant thoughts Americans have about other countries and this process. Trump didn't make it the process any worse then it's been for decades but now the level of ignorance is so high; it's insane. My largest problem is that this show takes importance of cultures and other countries and just throws them out the window. Of course, everyone has been told families are very close in other cultures; much more then ours. But you don't really know that being an American. I had to learn as well but no matter what country another person is coming from; better or worse, these people are having to think of leaving a very strong familial circle. Yet all these people and Americans in general have this arrogant idea that they are getting a favor from a green card. These are real people we are talking about. People whom have lives we can't know. My husband is from Italy for crying out loud. There are some from Europe and the only thing they are told is that they're lucky to come here. Has anyone been to these countries and cities outside the US? I lived in Italy and saw much of Spain and here to tell you, there is a beauty and culture I had much difficulty leaving. My husband sacrificed for my kids and myself to leave his family and beloved home when we came back to the US. If you go into this kind of situation, be aware from the first email that you will have to do things much differently. Learn the other culture, TALK to your so on those hundreds of texts and messages. Give the other importance always and be understanding of differences. We assumed no trust at first. We communicated to the other what we expected, time lines, etc. as well as all the difficulties we could face. We began after the first months when we decided to take it more then friendship that it was all or nothing. We prepared research for each im about the other's culture, world views and questions. From the beginning, when he or I called, we made certain to answer where we were, take photos of the moment and send, etc. until we met several times enough to trust and we communicated this verbally. But most important, I was very open and sensitive to the fact he was talking to an American and how much he loved his own culture. When we talked about where we would end up (and we did this for almost 2 years and 5 times meeting with separations) I was very, very considerate of his life there. His family and responsibilities were more important to him. I worked hard to move my children and myself to his country and retired early from the school system. His mother needed him as did his whole family that centered around him. Sacrifices. That is what you need to know going into this. Compromise, honesty, respect of other cultures and putting the other person first. Probably the truest test of love. I think these people needed help understanding that. When we arrived back to the US a few years ago, I had to be separated for 18 months during the process. There were no problems other then a lawyer that was not diligent about one piece of paper needed. It is just a very long process. We have been together 10 years, two countries, many, many challenges most would never even believe or imagine and still love each other very deeply. I don't take one moment for granted and neither does he. We are close to 50, both work very hard here in the US (my husband was a computer programmer in Rome and now works at a factory ft without a complaint). I really wish this show would show more stories like ours so it could be more of a learning show then a dramatic soap opera destined to just make this seem like real life for people already whom know nothing of what this kind of relationship entails and other cultures are.",/review/rw2969016/?ref_=tt_urv

","You have to giver TLC credit, They have figured out how they can take about 2 hours of content on 4-5 couples and stretch it out over several years showing the exact same clips over and over ad nauseum.

19 April 2020,brentleysmth,7," How do they convince people to sign up for this insanity
","I don't review programming often. First and foremost, ""reality TV"" I hate to break it to y'all is mostly scripted and manipulated in post to fit the narrative the shows producers want. That being said, it's even more crazy they get these people to do it. I am in a state of bewilderment. I've never experienced a dialectic so strongly, my extreme level of embarrassment for these people walks hand in hand with my extreme level of intrigue a mix that left me uncomfortably comfortable. I've read that the subjects of these ""reality"" programs, do not receive compensation. (at least not from the producing network) I have thought about this more than I care to admit and I just can't figure out why anyone would participate on what is essentially a worldwide television show that makes the people participating look as bad as they do for our enjoyment. This is not a complaint however because it is unnervingly captivating. I can't shake the feeling that there couldn't possibly be this many ignorant, oblivious walking cringe emitters and its all an act... but that is another reason I ended up watching the whole damn series, because I wanted to catch them slipping and pull a Truman show gotcha.",/review/rw2969016/?ref_=tt_urv

","Some of the past seasons were really entertaining, and many of the cast members were not clout chasers as they are today.

",Unfortunely shows on tlc nowadays are all about the drama nothing but drama if you are unconfutable with it then avoid this and the network. so basically its about 2 people from 2 different places one of them is the fiancé and the other tries to find love with in him but it also has to go wrong because the fiancé obviously insults her and then she gets mad and then gets revenge on him by being a bad role model other people read this review do not try any of this at home as it will go poorly because the fiancé that you try to meet might be bad towards you so don't risk that instead be smart and don't date someone from another country. and this show is a clear example of that. tlc must be stopped immediately before it damages the brain of youngsters.,/review/rw2969016/?ref_=tt_urv

Instead, it finds the worst people so the viewers can collectively get angry at these disgusting people to feed our own ego. Such a toxic environment, but crap like this sells.

","75% of these couples don't even last, I can't even count how many times the non-american literally states they're doing it to live in america, it's painfully obvious in a lot of the couples yet these americans are too stupid to realize it. Luckily it's not ALL the couples, but most. This show can be pretty entertaining but it's infuriating to see a lot of these americans being completely used, but sometimes they need to be to wake up and realize some sexy foreigner that's half their age doesn't ACTUALLY want to be with them. Don't let this discourage you however, as obviously there are still quite a few couples that aren't using each other in some way and end up lasting at least a couple years.",/review/rw2969016/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2022,iscorrales,3," Main reason why tlc is failing
","Ok I'm not trying to be rude or anything, but this is probably the worst show on tlc. This show is going way too out of hand and i think it has the same plots all over again with the characters saying stuff what drama happened in the last week or so. It's all about the same romantic crap all over again. It's just like teen Mom from mtv. They also add way too many bleep censors and it getting really annoying and cringeworthy, proving that they are potty mouths. I feel really bad for the kids who had to be in this abomination. It's like if you watch like one of them, you've pretty much watch all of them. I'm not even a romantic kid myself. So why bother make new episodes if it's the same plot all over again?! I feel like that tlc refuses to rely on new ideas and stuff. Not to mention, that what does this show have to do with learning when there isn't really educational value on the learning channel? To make matters worse, they actually have like 7 smothers show that probably nobody asked for. I'm so glad that most of teen moms shows have been ended since 2022, because they have the same plots and romantic crap all over again and they refuse to rely on new ideas. Also, I hope that 2023 or 2024 marks the end of an era for all of these types of shows that actually have relationship with the company that they are meant to be. They should return to the classic days that they did before like 2007 or something. Can they just end these shows already, since some CEO's obviously don't care about some of what their fans think about the modern shows? Like I said before, these are my thoughts on why tlc is failing about now, just no offense to anyone who makes these types of shows.",/review/rw2969016/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2014,mrscdurham-931-510333,8," Cute, Innocent, and Sincere
","I hate that most of the personal reviews I've read thus far have been mostly nit-picky and negative. Who is anyone to judge who we fall in love with whether an American citizen or not. There are sooo many other aspects to consider way beyond someone's citizenship status and if these couples met, got to know each other and fell in love then kudos to them. No different than any other relationship really. 90 Day Fiancé is just a show that points out the geographical and cultural differences tied to some time constraints with these four particular couples. Can't we just all agree to not judge their love? We all will either fall deeper in love or fall out of love - no matter the pairing. Time will tell. These lovely people have to figure this out for themselves and I personally admire the fact they're willing to try and have a lot of hope. This show is sweet and the couples seem sincere and very hopeful therefore, I remain hopeful for their success.",/review/rw2969016/?ref_=tt_urv
