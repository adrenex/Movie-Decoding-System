20 October 2020,dannair,5," My God season 2 is boring!
","Season 1 was excellent with a diverse range of topics and mysteries that had you talking for weeks. However season 2 is just the opposite, its boring and having to call some of them a ""mystery"" is a bit of a stretch.",/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2020,drpainters,5," One story per episode and no narrator.. just another reality crime show
",I'm just watching the first episode but it's just a standard crime story with drawn out interviews and random stories to stretch out the timing. I don't understand why they didn't stick with the same original awesome format. Thats the whole appeal.,/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2020,rmmil,3," Season 2 was a major letdown
","Call it volume 2 or season 2, either way I call it (mostly) boring. It's a harsh word to use, but yeah, boring is the best way to describe it.",/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2020,laughing_cat,7," One story per episode???
","As others have said, this new format feels like Dateline. What happened to 4-6 mysteries per episode? We already know they are unsolved, so 52 minutes is a LONG time to spend on something with no closure. I do not see this one lasting very long unless the pace is improved.",/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2020,jakebrann,6," Episode 1... HELICOPTER?!
",Why was there no mention the entire time of the possibility of him being dropped out of a helicopter? That would completely explain being able to fall through that metal roof and all the damage to his body. His vehicle could have been moved to that hotel and then his cell phone and glasses thrown over by the hole from the parking garage. That case was irritating that the police department was so stupid and just called it a suicide. Unreal...,/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2020,robertlee-95845,2," I'll solve the missing salon owner episode for you
","At the end it said call the tip line, It...was...her...husband",/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2020,Osibob,7," It doesn't quite ""Stack"" up to the original
","Someone commented that the revamped version of 'UM' reminds them of ""Dateline,"" which I find to be an apt comparison. Though I will say the first and fifth episodes are exceptions; the latter for more obvious reasons. The former episode was great and reminded me of the original series. Yes, it was a whodunit, but other aspects were brought in. For example, how was the victim killed? It was under very unusual circumstances and shrouded by mystery, oh and the Freemasons!!!
Despite them going down a more ""Dateliney"" path for most of the other episodes, I still enjoyed the program overall and give them kudos for trying something different. 7/10...Good, not great.",/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2020,tresm87,5," It has ambitious attempts at reviving the iconic series, but its new single story ep format is dull, and overall lacks the foreboding nature of the original.
","The original Unsolved mysteries was truly fantastic and holds a special place in many people's hearts. It was a very innovative, disturbing, and truly thought provoking series of the late 80s - mid 90s network tv realm with a timeless host/narrator named Robert Stack who became the face of the show. The true stories were brought to life with solidly creepy reenactments, dramatic interview accounts, and plenty of updates on stories.",/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2020,rdoubleoc,10," Give me more!
","Finally, good content is being made again, or so it seems. They did good with this show, but future episodes need to be just as interesting. Please don't have so many murder episodes, though.",/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2020,sensesfail_51,2," This doesn't deserve the title of Unsolved Mysteries
","Although the show is ok, it is nothing like the original. For one hour, we focus on the same story. In the old episodes, there were many stories in one. Also, the older episodes had ghosts, aliens, robberies etc. These episodes focus on one missing person and thats it. It is like watching your average crime documentary show! Mix it up a little. Incorporate the old ways into the new show.",/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2020,carlink,3," Needs a conclusion/ average and lazy
",The show itself isn't bad but it doesn't really delve into any part of the case that isn't already common knowledge. The first episode desperately needed a conclusion and some further investigation or legal intervention to actually get to the bottom of the mystery from the shows producers would no doubt have given this disappointing show what it needs to be a big hit,/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2020,Lexiii67,1," Hate this format.
",I started with the last episode. They spend forty minutes interviewing a bunch of random people talking about other random people and they don't give you a damn clue about who is who. About halfway through the episode they start telling you what it's all about.,/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,7," Interesting.
","An interesting watch, I find this kind of storytelling quite strange, maybe because I'm British, but the thought of sensationalising real life crimes does seem somehow distasteful, but I'm sure we'd all want answers to questions concerning the death of a loved one, particularly when those answers aren't available.",/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2020,editing_budgie,5," Any slower and this would come to a complete stop
",Another Netflix 'doc' series ruined by bad story editing.,/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2020,collectorofsorts,5," It's Basically Dateline with the Unsolved Mysteries Name and Theme Music.
","This series is, pretty much, a Dateline rip-off. It's not Unsolved Mysteries. The original Unsolved Mysteries had a Host that brought the touching elements to each story. This show has no host. The original had multiple stories in each episode. Usually 3-4 different stories each week. This one has one story per episode. Hour long shows about one case we've never heard of isn't really something that I (or most folks) want to watch. There's too much filler here. Too much meaningless and unimportant info that has nothing to do with the case. There's no real investigations here. It's just family members and friends giving their personal views and thoughts. VERY BORING STUFF! Other than the name and the old Unsolved Mysteries theme music, it's nothing like the original. It's just long, drawn-out and boring segments. I feel like I'm being generous with 5 stars. I won't mention any of the cases they went into or add any spoilers. I'll leave that you you to discover if you're into really drawn out and boring shows. I will say that I'm disappointed. I've waited for quite a while since they publicized the reboot was in the works. This isn't what I expected.",/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2020,crustysaltmerchant,4," Pointless when 5 out the 6 mysteries are anything but.
",So out of the 6 episodes only 1 is a genuine mystery. The other 5 are just about murders where no one was charged. They're not mysterious at all. It's blatant to anyone who watches who's killed whom or why. The biggest mystery is why weren't any suspects arrested? Not a patch on the old version.,/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2020,jwneal,2," Interesting-ish, SLOWWWWWWW
","These are a beating to get through. Redundant clips and commentary. These should be 10-20 mins long max. Painfully slow. Interesting stories become drab because of the sluggish pace, redundant commentary, and predictability of each episode.",/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2020,markwha,7," Interesting and captivating but missing something
","After watching 4/6 episodes currently available on Netflix I'm certainly pleased with the nostalgic feeling of interest and captivation accompanied by the original music and themes of the classic show hosted by Robert Stack. The recipe is missing an important ingredient however, in that there is no host to introduce, comment and conclude the stories. Don't get me wrong, I understand that this was done as the creators and Netflix felt that there couldn't be a replacement for such a perfect and iconic host, but this type of program isn't near as effective with the absence of some kind of a narrating voice to help the story along. This absence is especially felt in episode 3 which is completely in subtitles as well as episode 5 where some witnesses of a UFO and alien abduction on their own seem rather... unconvincing to say the least..",/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2020,fieswald,2," Each episode could have been 10 minutes long.
","For instance, the first episode on the missing husband? Without any real evidence, witnesses or conclusions drawn the entire summery could have been one sentence: Husband found dead after supposedly falling through a hole in a roof too far from neighbouring buildings to jump, and his friend refused to talk. The end. But yet they stretched it into an hour?",/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2020,ccobur-84862,5," Not like the Unsolved Mysteries we love, pretty much just another episode of Dateline
","Where is the fast paced, multiple mysteries per episode, exciting Unsolved Mysteries? This is slow, boring, and just one drawn out story per episode. There is not host, either. The formula worked before, why change it? I was hoping it would be pretty much the same except with new mysteries and a new host. Now it's just like any other crime show. Nothing left of the original series except the intro music. Disappointing.",/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2020,heavensnight-88203,8," Ominous and unsettling indeed.
","A very well made reboot of the iconic series, Netflix does generally seem to be very good at crime documentary's. Six episodes in Vol. 1 and these first six cases are bizarre and completely intriguing.",/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2020,justicejvm,7," Needs some work
","No narrator was a disappointment, couple of the episodes where grueling long feel like they could have made each story 30 mins.",/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2020,kenyae-cagle,6," I don't know
","First of all I didn't like that each episode only focused on ONE story unlike the original talking about multiple stories. Next, The stories NEED tangible and identifiable evidence in my opinion. Alonzo Brooks needs to get full justices.",/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2020,amsterdamjen,6," So... there are two main reasons I've watched two episodes. Wait, make that three:
","1. There's someone actually named Pistol Black- Cool.
2. The men that found human remains in the woods had planned to meet up and ""eat biscuits"" together.
3. The theme song.",/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2020,PubChampion,5," Need a lot of patience
","This is one of the slowest-moving crime documentaries I've ever seen. You can go out for a few minutes, come back and not miss anything significant. Otherwise, well made and doesn't feel cheap like many others.",/review/rw6072280/?ref_=tt_urv
