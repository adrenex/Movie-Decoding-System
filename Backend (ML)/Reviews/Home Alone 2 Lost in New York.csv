17 August 2016,TheMovieDoctorful,10," Tragically Underrated Disney Film, One Of Their Best
","Until the release of ""Frozen"", ""Treasure Planet"" may have been the most over marketed Disney film of all time upon release. Back in 2002, it was EVERYWHERE. TV Spots for it were played almost religiously, ""Treasure Planet"" action figures and games were constantly being advertised between commercials on pretty much every kids entertainment channel and various fast food restaurants and cereal brands included ""Treasure Planet"" toys with their products. So obviously under-marketing was not the movie's problem...Which baffles me as the film was a massive financial flop earning only $109.6 million on a $140 million budget. So taking that into consideration, along with the fact that Disney would follow up ""Treasure Planet"" with the dismal ""The Jungle Book 2"" and the atrocious ""Home On The Range"", that MUST mean the movie was awful right? WRONG. Not only is ""Treasure Planet"" a childhood favorite, but is hands down one of the best, most emotional, most exciting and most investing Disney movies of all time. It's the most underrated without question.",/review/rw2957969/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2020,CubsandCulture,10," I am so glad I re-watched this...it is wonderful
","I had a very negative reaction to this film when it first came out, thinking that transporting Treasure Island into space was as silly as turning Dangerous Liaisons into a teen melodrama, ala Cruel Intentions. I recently reread the novel and decided to watch a few cinematic treatments of the story. This one ended up standing out from other versions. It is remarkable how close the final film is to the spirit of the novel while scrambling the plot, characters. It is just as an exciting piece of visual entertainment as the novel is of prose. A lot of the choices the script makes-beefing up Silver as a father figure-really land with this setting.",/review/rw2957969/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2004,dbborroughs,9," Someday This Will Be Hailed as a Great Film
","Somewhere along the way this film got lost. I'm inclined to think that Disney buried this film on purpose since it opened at exactly the same time as the latest Harry Potter film. This was the film that, according to Disney, the future of traditional animation hung, and they went out of their way to bury it, going so far as to declare it a failure even before the first days grosses came out.",/review/rw2957969/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2006,Company_of_Wolves,7," Swashbuckling Science Fiction
","Treasure Planet is the adaptation of the classic swashbuckling children's tale of Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. R.L.S originally wrote Treasure Island chapter by chapter for his son, as a bed time story for each night. When the story was first published it was actually condemned by some! Claiming that such violent tales encouraged boys to become ner-do-well's such as the pirates it glorifies! Suffice to say, Disney's futuristic adaptation fails to capture the rebellious nature of the original Treasure Island. Fans and fanatics can gripe all they want if a scene is missing from the book, or if a character's been changed, but as long as the core meaning of the story remains, it's essence. Then adaptation has been successful. Treasure Planet does not capture the essence of the book entirely, in fact it lacks a lot of it's power due mainly to the protagonist. Jim Hawkins of Treasure Planet does not suffer as much as his archaic counterpart, therefore his character does not under go the same heroic journey and does not emerge as profoundly changed as R.L.S original did.",/review/rw2957969/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2002,kalel6868,8," Incredible Visuals Compensate for an Overly Familiar Story
","Robert Louis Stephenson's `Treasure Island' has always been one of my favorite classic stories.  The tale of a teenage boy thrust into the adventure of a lifetime features pirates, swordfights, an ocean voyage, betrayals, and buried treasure among many other classic adventure-story ingredients Â– what's not to love?",/review/rw2957969/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2005,blueraptor77,8," Worth more than the credit everyone gives it...
","Upfront, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie beyond what I thought I would take from it. Being an animation major I can thoroughly pick apart most movies, especially what Disney puts out now-a-days. Unfortunately for their movie Treasure Planet, either it was ahead of itself ambitiously, or it was rumors that spread like wildfire (when it was being released) that killed it. Actually, that's why I didn't see this film until very recently, because of everyone's (and mine at the time) prejudice against Disney features springing up amongst way too many viewers, and especially for this film. I believed them that this film was terrible, and subsequently never got to see it until a week ago. Man, everyone was wrong.",/review/rw2957969/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2020,siderite,9," One of the last true Disney animations?
","This movie can be seen as a blend of the old and the new on every level. It is a remake of the classic Treasure Island book, but it's set in space (or a sort of space-like universe). It blends classically hand-drawn animation with CG. It features the good old tried tropes of Disney stories, including endearing but rather unfashionable approaches to human relationships (see the strong female character getting hitched with the one male who stands up to her). It flopped when it was released, but it is a rather fun adventure aimed at older children.",/review/rw2957969/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2007,gkbowood,8," Supremely rippin ride!
","Cast yer sails matey...we be blastin outta these worlds! It was all good: cast,script, music, and the effects animation was the BEST! So why the rate of 8 then, well I really didn't like B.E.N.'s personality, but I'm sure others out there will love him. There are plenty of funny moments, endearing moments (without being sappy), and just the right touch of suspense to keep you hanging on. I was so glad the romance was played down for once, along with those endless Disney love songs. The one scene in the movie that is accompanied by song is such a score! Completes the scene of who Jim is and how he feels with just that one song. Bravo Johnny Rzeznik! I plan to go out and buy this DVD. I only wish I could have a Morphy on my computer to play with; Disney missed the boat big time on that gold.",/review/rw2957969/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," Very well done animated film!
","Sure it isn't perfect, but then again, few movies are. The visuals are a delight to look at, with a wide range of colours, and the art direction is much better than it is in most direct to video sequels. The music is lovely too, not the best score in the world, but I liked it. However, the story is very overly-familiar and some of the characters aren't quite as convincing as others. Be thankful that the voice talents are so good, like Tony Jay lending his distinguished voice as the narrator. Emma Thompson is lovely as Amelia and makes the most of some witty dialogue, and David Hyde Pierce impresses as well. Martin Short is good as BEN but his character isn't quite as appealing as the others, Morph was one of my favourites. I liked the idea of making Silver a cyborg, and Brian Murray does a respectable job, and Jim, while slightly bland to start with was appealing. All in all, a well done animated film, that is only let down by slightly unoriginal plotting. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",/review/rw2957969/?ref_=tt_urv

9 May 2006,darklord2777,10," Amazing Movie
","This movie, even though given a bad rap by the critics, happens to be one of the best movies in the world. If you have not seen it, step away from your computer and rush out to get it. I don't wanna see you till you have that movie. Got it? Good now watch it. This movie's amazing graphics, twisting and riveting storyline, although based on the book Treasure Island it has many changes, including story changes, characters, and its planets not islands. Its amazing even though made by Disney anyone from age 10-100 can love this movie! The final sense with Silver and Hawkins is amazing and yet, in a way a bit sad. (That might have been a spoiler thats why I checked Spoiler) I also Loved the Music, it was amazing. The greatness in the whole film was flawless. The song ""I'm still here"" by the goo goo dolls was spectacular. I could not find anything about this whole film that did not make me smile, with the voices fitting the characters perfectly, and the amzaing graphics! This was a amazing film by Disney. It would make Robert Louis Stevenson proud, especially for the name of the ship the RLS Legicy; or the Robert Louis Stevenson Legicy. You could really feel Jims struggle, and Silver's emotions. I could not find one flaw with this movie! I gave it a 11 out of 10.",/review/rw2957969/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2005,arrohed1025,10," Wonderful!! Highly underrated
","When this film first came out, I was quite a bit skeptical, given what I thought was another lame Disney storyline like Atlantis, Emperor's New Groove and Mulan, and opted out of seeing it in theaters. Now 3 years later I was curious to see what it was all about, so I gave it a chance and rented it. To my surprise, I was blown away by the brilliant animation and complex storyline (going beyond the book), and wondered how this film could have been so overlooked. The coming of age story about a teenage boy deals with real issues in today's world, and how each of us has our own potential to reach. I also loved the score and the music by John Rzeznik. The only complaints I have is that Jim looks much older than his supposed age (15), perhaps 17 or so, and that the robot was obnoxious and shouldn't have been added in at the end. All in all, I'd have to put this on my list of favorite Disney films since The Lion King and Pocahontas.",/review/rw2957969/?ref_=tt_urv

23 November 2015,davispittman,8," The most underrated Disney film
","Treasure Planet is so underrated and I honestly cannot believe it because it's so entertaining and fun for the entire family to sit down and watch! The lines of dialogue between characters here is so intelligent and funny. The special effects and the animation is wonderfully made. The voice actors were cast very well too, especially Emma Thompson, she did especially well! This movie's plot is well constructed and well executed. I was thoroughly impressed with this 2002 Disney film, and I truly believe you will be impressed as well. Treasure Planet is one of my favorite animated movies, it has some very heart warming and touching moments too. 8/10 for Disney's Treasure Planet (2002)",/review/rw2957969/?ref_=tt_urv

","Disney has been attempting their latest genre, ""action/adventure"", and Treasure Planet is yet another of these more adult films.

12 February 2006,horsey330,9," Wonderful!
","I loved T.P from the first time I saw the preview. I went to see it with my friends and we were just dazzled by the brilliance of the story. (sorry about my cruddy spelling)I instantly took a liking to young Jim Hawkins and the charming John Silver, and fell in love with the wonderful animation. It's been three years since the movie came out, and I'm still crazy about it. I've watched it over 300 times. It is truly wonderful and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes real honest to god animated movies. ",/review/rw2957969/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2015,NateWatchesCoolMovies,10," One of Disney's very best
","Disney's Treasure Planet is one of the most underrated films to ever be put out by the studio. It has imagination in spades, a quirky, eclectic cast of voice actors, a palpable sense of meaning thanks to the fantastic adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic, and a galactic gallery of insanely creative cosmic visuals that are breathtaking. This is seriously the most beautiful looking Disney film I've seen. Rich detailed work blends the old fashioned wood style of the 1700's with a robotic, steam punk esque sensibility that blows the mind. As a result we get sky pirate ships that navigate maroon crested waves of the sea of stars, a wonderfully lively cyborg Long John Silver (Brian Murray POWER), a wicked sky surfing sequence complete with hover boat cops, a gorgeous exotic forest worlds away, and grotesque, gnarly aliens with lilting pirate brogues. The melding of the two styles is uncannily successful. Joseph Gordon Levitt lays young Jim Hawkins wonderfully, with a sense of roguish style and thirst for adventure that brings the character to life. Cantankerous Patrick Mcgoohan briefly voices a reptilian Billy Bones to great effect. The neurotic, jumpy Martin Short voices, you guessed it, a neurotic and jumpy Robot version of the castaway Ben. Michael Wincott lends his cement speckled rasp to Scroop, a deliciously evil spider pirate villain. Why this flick didn't get the rapturous acclaim of stuff like Frozen or Tangled is beyond me. It's got loads of committed imagination, and reinvents a timeless tale for a futuristic twist that isn't gimmicky, and doesn't try too hard. It pays detailed attention to every little creation. The little ball of pink flubbed named Morph is a winner. The way the sails of the sky pirate vessels are honeycombed with electronic solar panels is inspired. These a few of the countless creations found in this movie. That sense of style melded with the mature, grounded way they treat the characters makes for a big winner.",/review/rw2957969/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2002,bix171,10," Disney's Continued Evolution
","As Disney animation evolves in its transition from films for all ages to targeting older children and new teenagers (`Dinosaur', `Atlantis: The Lost Empire', `Lilo & Stitch'), they continue to deal with the fickleness of that market, one that has a shorter attention span than ever and tastes that encompass more vicarious forms of entertainment. `Treasure Planet' is an attempt to meet that audience while updating source material that might have a more universal appeal. It's probably the most cohesive and engrossing Disney animated feature in years, filled with awe-inspiring set pieces (altering `Treasure Island' to take place in space is a marvelous concept) and with many of the psychological insights that have made Disney films gentle but astute tutors on childhood. This time, though, the theme is more mature (the search for the father who has abandoned you and being able to let him go once you've found him), aimed at a crowd perhaps old enough to understand it explicitly. To that end, they make Jim Hawkins, the main character (voiced by Joseph Gordon-Levitt from `3rd Rock From The Sun'), something of a delinquent (though one a danger only to himself) whose self-esteem is directly tied to his need for a father-figure. Fortunately, to keep things entertaining, there's plenty of (mostly) low humor provided by the most jovial of the current crop of Disney directors, Ron Clements and John Musker, whose introduction of slapstick into `Aladdin' via Robin Williams was perhaps the animation unit's masterstroke. This time around, comic relief is in the form of Martin Short as a wacked-out robot and Mona Marshall as Morph, the best sidekick since Iago in `Aladdin'. The other voice cast members, all appealing, include Emma Thompson as Captain Amelia and David Hyde Pierce as Dr. Doppler; but it's the gifted Brian Murray as John Silver that makes the most impact, bringing sensitivity as well as menace to a role that is exactly what the underlying text calls for. A great film. ",/review/rw2957969/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2020,MissSimonetta,6," Probably THE Disney cult film
","TREASURE PLANET is more often than not counted among Disney's underrated titles and in the years since its initial flop in 2002, it's become a cult film. I can see the appeal-- the aesthetics are cool and the animation is great-- though honestly, every time I rewatch this one so much of it feels rushed, particularly the growth of the bond between Jim and Silver, which is the heart of the story. Still, it's an enjoyable movie and deserved better than it got 18 years ago.",/review/rw2957969/?ref_=tt_urv

Treasure Planet, a Disney film which I've decided to re-visit after many years of forgottens. And a spectacular journey through the ages it was, and one's memories who for so long has been lost is now reclaimed.

31 March 2006,tama_otaku,10," Disneys greatest film yet? could be....
","What a film!, action, drama, suspense, adventure, not to mention many other qualities any good film should have and qualities lacking in all but one other Disney film, namely the hunchback of Notre dame. the story focuses on young Jim Hawkins who through the greatest adventure of his life undergoes an incredibly emotional character transformation, from thug to respected spacer(sailer, but in space, get it?). and along the way is morally guided by a rather gruff and cynical cyborg, john silver, who happens to see in Jim ""the makings of greatness"", and so his heart is melted by Jim's situation(namely the loss of his father at a very young age) leading silver to disregard the ribbing's of his crew and lead young Hawkins to greatness. the film has its heart breakers to as at the end of the adventure, silver being found out as a pirate, must leave Hawkins side for what is quite possibly forever, don't forget the Kleenex, but leaves with him his beloved pet morph, an adorable little... eh... thing that can take on the shape of whatever it wants, and so if you want to see what i believe to be the greatest Disney film of all time, see treasure planet, you will not be disappointed!",/review/rw2957969/?ref_=tt_urv

","Disney decided to adapt another classic this time in the form of Stevenson's classic Treasure Island, giving it a futuristic make over in order to give us Treasure Planet. To be honest I think this is probably Disney's most underrated modern feature, it doesn't get mentioned often even though it works as a great update of the novel and as a fantastic film in its own right.",/review/rw2957969/?ref_=tt_urv
