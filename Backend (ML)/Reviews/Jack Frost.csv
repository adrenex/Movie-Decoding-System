","A chilling psychological thriller, that is cleverly written and superbly portrayed.",/review/rw1107978/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2016,Leofwine_draca,9," Hugely underrated, one of my favourites of the decade
","With a clever central premise and a refreshing lack of any special effects work whatsoever (apart from a nifty 'demon vision' which is used occasionally), FALLEN is a cut above the standard fare of today's American horror films. With a more complex plot than usual (for once, the film doesn't underestimate the intellect of the viewer) and plenty of suspense and nightmarish scenes built up, this will be a refreshing treat for any horror fan.",/review/rw1107978/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2005,Boba_Fett1138,8," A supernatural thriller with a great story!

18 November 2015,seymourblack-1,8," Detective & Demon In Deadly Dual
","Shortly after thinking that he'd brought an end to a series of murders, a homicide detective starts to realise that the perpetrator is still at large and is also someone who couldn't possibly be arrested or brought to justice by conventional methods. The way in which his investigation leads him to these findings and the formulation of a highly unconventional plan to end the killings, provides ""Fallen"" with its extremely offbeat plot. This well-written story begins very colourfully in a way that raises a lot of questions and then proceeds through the investigation stage before reaching it brilliantly twisted conclusion.",/review/rw1107978/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2006,ccthemovieman-1,8," Legitimately Creepy
","This gets good marks simply because it is such an interesting, involving story that hooks you right away and every time you watch it and doesn't overwhelm you with violence and gore.",/review/rw1107978/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2005,hengir,7," Fallen Up
","Came across this film in a video store sale bin at a giveaway price and bought it on the strength of the cast, Denzil Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland and Embeth Davidtz. Found it to be surprisingly good. Not a horror film as such, no gore or unconvincing CGI effects but a gripping story with supernatural elements. There are subtle shivers, particularly the 'touching' scenes and the sense of something evil hidden behind the everyday. The setting is bleakly autumnal and it is finishes with a nice twist. If you watch the film again knowing the ending it makes more sense.",/review/rw1107978/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2003,Idocamstuf,7," Better than you would expect
","This was actually a pretty clever supernatural thriller.  When released it failed at the box office, but has deveolped a following since.  It's quite fascinating, hardly ever boring, has a nice cast, and is pretty creepy. It probubly failed due to poor marketing, because if a piece of crapp like ""Hollow Man""(2000) can be a hit, this film should definately have been a hit.  If you like supernatural thrillers, this will be right up your alley. *** out of ****.",/review/rw1107978/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 1998,Jedi-24,9," Chilling yet intriguing
","Fallen is not your typical suspense film. There is very little gore, a clever plot, gorgeous cinematography...but it all adds up to the scariest movie I've ever seen. Why? It plays with your mind. The horror is confined to your brain and not shown onscreen. Some people will (and do) hate this film; it eschews graphic storytelling for a visual, intellectual approach. The ending, which has been criticized for many reasons, is actually the only plausible way it could end. Yes we like to see the human spirit triumph, but more often than not things do not work out the way we like them to. It's refreshing to see a movie which ends on a real level, giving the film a true-to-life credibility which enhances the terror even more. Highly recommended for the intellectual person. Those easily bored stay away.",/review/rw1107978/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2021,iwalrus,8," Slow burning thriller
","Just caught this film for the first time on TV, drawn to it by the cast.
The suspense builds with good acting by Denzel Washington, Donald Sutherland, John Goodman and James Gandolfini (just before the Sopranos).
Proving that you don't need too much blood and guts to create a good thriller.
Definitely worth a look.",/review/rw1107978/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2005,BigHardcore,9," More Than Your Average Supernatural Suspense Thriller!
","After my initial viewing of the movie, Fallen, I knew that I had just seen a brilliant film. However, I did have a few questions, mostly concerning plot holes and things of that nature, so I immediately watched the parts in question again and found that everything ties in nicely with very few, if any, plot holes. If there are, I can not find them.",/review/rw1107978/?ref_=tt_urv

25 July 2005,bob the moo,," A solid thriller with good pace and nice twists that benefits from a strong lead performance from Washington
","Homicide detective John Hobbes is a clean cop with a good reputation; a reputation built on many closed cases including his most recent conviction and death sentence for serial killer Edgar Reese. Moments before his death Reese starts speaking a strange language and threatens Hobbes with revenge. Gassed to death and buried, Reese is just another reason for Hobbes to be smug on television but soon murders start happening with such a level of detail that it can only be that Reese had a partner who has carried on in his vein. Investigating this only produces more impossible findings and Hobbes soon runs out of answers; however it soon transpires that things beyond the human world are at play and this is much more than murder.",/review/rw1107978/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2022,I_Ailurophile,10," Thrilling, chilling, smart, and fulfilling
","I remember very well when this movie came out, and I feel a bit silly having taken this long to get around to it. The wait was worth it, though, because there's a great deal about this that I don't know I would have been able to appreciate 24 years ago. Three specific names attached to it have solid records, and in one fashion or another I've come across them before, but the combination of all their skills is a tremendous result. Accomplished composer Tan Dun contributes an absolutely terrific score, defined largely of strings and light percussion, that all by itself lends a powerful, hair-raising tension and unease to the picture. Director Gregory Hoblit, notable for no few great works in film and TV, demonstrates a deft, expert hand in combining facets of the police procedural genre with a dark, gripping supernatural thriller, and the fundamental arrangement of shots and scenes is fabulous as it builds to that end. Last but not least, writer Nicholas Kazan carries weight of his own, and his screenplay is frankly a small marvel as he exquisitely blends together elements of horror, crime thriller, and psychological thriller. The result of all this is a feature that is genuinely chilling, and absorbing, with a fantastic atmosphere at once unsettling, haunting, and sorrowful. It's one matter to read the premise of 'Fallen,' and know what it's about; it's another matter to experience it - this is outstanding.",/review/rw1107978/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2020,SimonD1900,8," Denzel Washington is fantastic
","I started watching this movie, knowing nothing about it more then it was a crime thriller about some serial killer, which usually is decent entertainment, not gonna lie. This movie started out in the usual way that these type of movies usually goes, still seemed promising, I really liked the characters and the vibe. Then it took a turn and first I thought ""oh no, it's turning in to one of those movies"" but then I realized it was still good, even better, I actually liked it a lot, it just wasn't what I first thought it would be. I believe this script could easily had become somewhat of a cheesy horror movie in the wrong hands, but not here, it's very well directed; has this gritty vibe and feel, like a David Finch movie kind of. And you're kept in suspense trough the whole movie, not knowing what's going to happen or how things will go down. And the acting is very good, supurb really. Very good dynamics between all characters, even side characters. I think this is Goodmans best role in his career. And Denzel takes the whole movie to another level, he is one of those actor that can do that, I think he must be one of the, if not the, greatest actor in American cinema actually. Anyway, this a good movie all I can say. Kind of an underrated movie but a real gem. I also appreciate it when movies can be creepy and scary without having to use gore or torture scenes. This movie is actually kind of refreshing, even if the premise isn't completely new, this movie really has it's own character.",/review/rw1107978/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2005,groohl,10," Overlooked movie
","This is a psychological thriller with every ingredient you could ever want for a great movie-experience in that genre. Denzel Washington acts brilliantly as the highly renowned detective Hobbes who's in for quite an experience. Co-actors, including John Goodman, Donald Sutherland and James Gandolfini also shine in this movie. Great acting, a story full of suspense and surprises, great score and some nerve-rattling scenes makes this a perfect movie worth buying for your collection. It's not only a great murder-mystery detective movie, but it probes deeper into the realms of faith, religion, philosophy and imagination and thus stands out as a movie more memorable than most. If you like ""Seven"" and ""The Ninth Gate"", you're certainly gonna like this one. I've seen it at least 6 times.",/review/rw1107978/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2001,robbik,9," little recognised classic
","Denzel Washington gives a strong performance in this surprisingly little known gem from director Gregory Hoblit. A classic detective thriller with a demonic edge, this film managers to keep the suspense running until the very end. With one of the most dramatic and scary personal chase sequences ever brought to the big or small screen, this film has it all, including a strong cast (Donald Sutherland and John Goodman in a surprisingly convincing non-comedy role as Hobbes partner to name but a few.)",/review/rw1107978/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is my first review on IMDB. Why now? Because this movie deserves to be watched. Over 20+ years ago I owned this on a VHS tape and made everyone I could watch it and everyone really enjoyed it. Why? Because it is wonderful screenplay with an amazing cast. I love a great thriller and this one truly is one of the best. I've seen it at least five times, holds up well and makes you think.",/review/rw1107978/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2005,Movie Nuttball,10," Excellent film!
","Fallen is a great film that has a great cast including Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, Embeth Davidtz, James Gandolfini, Elias Koteas, Gabriel Casseus, Robert Joy, Frank Medrano, Bill Clark, and Graham Beckel! The acting by all of these actors is unbelievable. Washington once again performed great. Goodman and Koteas arguably have the greatest performances in this picture! Sutherland is excellent and Davidtz is just wonderful. Gandolfini is very different and Beckel has a brief but one heck of a performance! I thought The horror is good and some of it is surprising. The movie is filmed really good. The music is great by Tan Dun. Ecellent directing by Gregory Hoblit! The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end. This is a great and thrilling film. If you like Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, Embeth Davidtz, James Gandolfini, Elias Koteas, the rest of the cast in the film, Horror, Mystery, Thriller, Action, Crime, and interesting films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today!",/review/rw1107978/?ref_=tt_urv

1 February 2020,Muhammad_Rafeeq,10," Fallen is Unforgettable Movie of my life. The Best ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10
","There is a sort of film making style that I really like, one where the director gives off many plot twists and thrills at you and then as it goes on, you would be confused about everything. Then in the end, the director will trick you, showing you everything in the very beginning itself but you will never be able to recognise it. making you the fool . If you like these sort of films, then Fallen is one that you should not miss. This film has a slow start, but once it passes the first half, you would then only understand what the whole thing's about and then this film catches a heft pace. What I really liked about this film is the ending where the director ending to you in the beginning itself, but you fail to notice it till the very end. Fallen is severely underrated for sure.",/review/rw1107978/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2003,Silverzero,," Bleak, ominous gothic thriller spirals into mediocrity.
","This is one of those films which gets a fair amount of publicity on cinematic release, but afterwards is never heard from again. I suppose the main reason is that there isn't much here that we haven't seen before. The concept of a demon passing from one person to another is fresh, but the execution is bland and dull. Very hard to engage the mind at first, once it grips it soon loses its way following on from one `it-wasn't-me' event to the next. ",/review/rw1107978/?ref_=tt_urv
