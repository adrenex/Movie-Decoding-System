",After reading a half-dozen of the reviews convinced that a lot of folks who didn't like it were expecting a typical cop show. It isn't. May have been an experiment on Bruckheimer's part - turning cop show conventions on their head.,/review/rw3838928/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2012,enochpsnow,10," A Somber But Often Poignant Detective Series
","I am sorry that ""Without A Trace"" went off the air after five years, though I agree with other reviewers that it had probably exhausted its possibilities. The show had many things going for it: a first-rate cast, a set of often surprising plot twists, and an ability to look at some of the darkest parts of New York city life. Anthony LaPaglia, as the head of the FBI missing- persons unit, gave a set of performances that were truly gripping: his character was always tough, devoted, and often very reserved, but there was always an enormous amount of passion locked within him which would come out at the most desperate moments. The rest of the cast were uniformly good, and I agree with many other observers that Marianne Jean-Baptiste was a superb actress and a perfect colleague for LaPaglia's plain-spoken FBI man.",/review/rw3838928/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2008,KUAlum26,," On Second thought
","A little while ago,I'd written a user comment that was faintly praising and perhaps a little more than cruel in dismissing this show as a sort of pedestrian,superficial attempt at sincere drama that is acted well-enough and scripted competently enough to be interesting. After watching more episodes(mostly in re-runs) and getting roundly unsupported by those who bothered an opinion of my review,I decided to do a rewrite.",/review/rw3838928/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2020,Bluesradio62,8," Social Justice Issues
",I always enjoy a good mystery and this is definitely one of those.....They are not afraid to tackle social issues like Abortion and Middle Eastern politics and much more.....Definitely a great series and I wish it had lasted even longer...but it did have a long run..........,/review/rw3838928/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2009,Angelus2,8," Good solid television
","I am not a fan of addict of this show and only caught episodes before leaving for college. But I have to say, the writing is very good and the actors are just as good.",/review/rw3838928/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2006,stonestroke2003,," Marianne Jean-Baptiste
","WAT is the show I look forward to watching most every week (comes in a close 2nd after The Closer). I don't know why so many people think the show has gone downhill. It still holds my interest for that hour. My only criticism (and it's not about Rosalyn Sanchez) is that they have one of the most talented actresses alive today, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, and they hardly use her! She deserves much more character development and depth to her role. It's the same story with S. Epatha Merkerson on Law & Order. Another underused great talent. However, perhaps after being recognized for Lackawanna Blues, NBC will wake up. Let's see more Marianne in the future. At least let her express an emotion every now and then. Even Tony LaPaglia is allowed to do that.",/review/rw3838928/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2004,cu_ee,," Contrarian viewpoint
","I find this show engaging enough to watch fairly regularly but have to disagree with all the glowing reviews that have been posted. The plot lines are often simplistic and sensationalist and the long music-driven ""emotional"" scenes are pandering and boring. The characters are one dimensional and any ""development"" seems forced. I feel like Lenny on Law & Order is my good buddy even though that show hardly has any character development, whereas the WAT characters seem more like bullet points--""the wise, good hearted leader with family problems"", ""the tough blonde going through an emotional crisis"", etc. The show is okay but it's really a slick presentation of something that could use a few more IQ points.",/review/rw3838928/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2020,catfanatic888,9," One of the BEST PROCEDURAL SHOWS EVER
",I love this show so much. I have watched every episode multiple times. The cast is one of the best ever assembled. The basic premise is a team of FBI Agents who search for missing persons from fascinating cases. Not every episode is perfect but there are few that aren't very good. Part of the excitement is the search and there's always the anticipation as to whether they are okay or not. a WHY did they disappear? Where are they? Who is responsible? Are they okay now? The stories are well written and intriguing. You will quickly become hooked on this show once you start.,/review/rw3838928/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2006,Antagonisten,5," Repetitive

21 March 2021,stewiec85,9," A show ahead of its time
","Without a trace is a show unlike any other. Watching this show takes to place of the missing person and the characters assigned to find them. Every case takes you to places you never expect which makes it more watchable. Not only it works as a mystery show but it also has a great cast including Anthony Lapaglia who gave one of his best performances as Agent Jack Malone who leads the missing person task force and wow does he steal the show. The other cast members including Marianne Jean-Baptiste and even Poppy Montgomery etc as the task force. Seeing their chemistry and showing how much dedication they put in their roles makes this a memorable show to watch. If you catch the reruns, I suggest giving it watch. It might have cancelled in 2009 but as of 2021 I'm happy to watch this show with such admiration unlike the crap we see today.",/review/rw3838928/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2020,bbewnylorac,8," Intelligent series
","I really enjoy this very meaty FBI series, which treats the viewer like they have a brain. it's a really reliable, entertaining show.The plots and scripts about missing people are snappy, and they're genuine mysteries. With lots of different strands and dead ends. To me, the best thing is the cast. If you have charismatic actors, it makes it easy to like and believe them. As others have said, the wonderful Marianne Jean-Baptiste is never given much air time as the wise, experienced detective Viv. As the boss, Anthony La Paglia is fantastic, as are his young team: Poppy Montgomery, Eric Close and Enrique Marciano. They're really relatable, and the series never gets bogged down in the characters' personal lives.",/review/rw3838928/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2007,just judit,7," I wish the 5 original players would be reinstated in the future.
","The show is still very good though my friends and I, who watch it together, agree with another viewer that Ms Sanchez ruined an excellent #10 show. There were already two women and a Spanish-American on board, so the show was politically correct and the ensemble fantastic. I never wished anybody (besides Hitler and heads of the soviet Union) to die, but I heartily wish that Ms Sanches' character would be shot for good and the show would return to its previous magnificence. Well, then I could purchase the following seasons' disks as well as those I had without Ms Sanchez' not enjoyable and unwanted presence. Could there be a possible hope in that direction? What a great thing it would be.",/review/rw3838928/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2010,TheLittleSongbird,5," Another good example of a show with pluses and minuses
","Now I liked Without a Trace when it first started. It wasn't brilliant, but somehow it kept my attention. But later around the time Rosalyn Sanchez came on the scene, while not as badly as Special Victim's Unit did, it jumped the shark a bit. Without A Trace is slick, with nice photography and interesting locations, while the music is great. The best asset though for me is Anthony LaPaglia, who is excellent as Jack. That said, Without a Trace does have its problems. The story ideas are interesting and are decently written in general, but there is a lot of ponderous pacing in this show. I appreciate it is for character development and atmosphere but there is almost every episode with one scene with nothing happening other than haunting music and reflective facial expressions it does get a bit too much. The show's writing is not exceptional either, not awful granted but it can get uninteresting and repetitive on occasions. I also have to concur about Rosalyn Sanchez, I personally don't think she adds anything to the show, and her character does come across as rather cold and difficult to empathise with. Overall, it was decent, but it is a show of pluses and minuses. 5/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw3838928/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2006,ccthemovieman-1,," Flawed, But Better Than I Figured
","If this hadn't been on sale for an extremely low price, I would never have seen it, which would have been my loss. This was good. Interesting stories, usually well-told and a cast of likable ""good guys.""",/review/rw3838928/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2008,xredgarnetx,6," Doesn't quite measure up
","As much as I admire Aussie actor Anthony LaPaglia, WAT is generally a very dull show, about people gone missing. LaPaglia is the head of an FBI unit specializing in finding missing persons. Unfortunately, he sleepwalks through most episodes. And his team, with the exception of Marianne Baptiste, is made up of typical B-level TV actors, all very generic and interchangeable. LaPaglia's character initially was introduced on one of the CSI shows. I can recommend watching WAT for one reason and one reason only: If there is no LAW & ORDER or LAW & ORDER SVU episode playing. Then it is better than nothing. It's like COLD CASE or CROSSING JORDAN: They are good enough to watch while waiting for LAW & ORDER. And I will say WAT is a cut above any of the CSI shows.",/review/rw3838928/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2006,LoneObserver,3," Weakest of the cop shows on TV
","This series started off with promise but has quickly faded to the back of the pack. The show is light on character development, which can be alright (see ""Law & Order"" with Benjamin Bratt and Jerry Orbach). However, the plots are hackneyed and played out in overly dramatic fashion, which doesn't work for a show that should be grittier and uglier. Also, I don't mind figuring out the mystery a few minutes early, it happens from time to time with all shows, but figuring it out 15 minutes early and then having to suffer through melodramatic moments and elaborate epiphanies accompanied by music that sounds as though it came from a ""Soundtracks 101a"" class is just gut-wrenching. My recommendation? Skip this copycat and stick with the winners: L&O (original), CSI (original), and The Shield. If you want a show closer to Without a Trace but with a bit more body, try ""Criminal Minds.""",/review/rw3838928/?ref_=tt_urv

18 May 2008,anachain,1," What a waste of what could be a great show
","I've come to hate this show--the agents are so over the top and the events are so badly done that to say it stretches reality is greatly beyond an understatement. Malone is off-kilter so much he should be in jail for all the stuff he pulls. The personal drama between the characters detract too much from what's going on. The agents consistently abuse, threaten, and brow-beat suspects, witnesses, and victims that that whole unit should be looking for new jobs...or suspension at the least. I've stopped watching this show...no originals, no reruns, no more TiVo season pass.",/review/rw3838928/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2018,josephesposito-33313,10," Sweat Dripping Right 'Till the End
","Almost every episode has its own predicament and the protagonist is a phenomenal actor. One episode there was a hostage situation. For 40 minutes straight I was sitting on the edge of my seat. The tension grew every single second, the hostage showing real emotions as if it wasn't even a show. The smallest details are shown from sweat to dialogue to how people act in certain scenes. If you like mystery, YOU WILL LOVE THIS SHOW.",/review/rw3838928/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2021,mstylianou7,7," Worked well for a while!

7 May 2006,goldenhummer78,2," OK First Season, Great Second Season and then it's all downhill
","What a waste! It took the WAT producers a half season until they hit their stride (the pilot was oh-hum but the show showed potential for growth, in particular with its great cast.) The second season was excellent, with better photography and more interesting writing and decent ""persoanl arcs"" for each character.",/review/rw3838928/?ref_=tt_urv
