1 January 2020,jtindahouse,9," Ritchie returns to the crime genre and does so masterfully
","Has there ever been a bad performance in a Guy Ritchie movie? If there has I haven't noticed it. He has an ornate ability to take average actors and make them great, and to take already great actors and get even more out of them. There are a few directors around who specialise in this but Ritchie is right near the top. The cast in 'The Gentlemen' is admittedly fantastic, but it doesn't change the fact that they are an absolute treat to watch. Matthew McConaughey is in his element in a role that he was born to play, Charlie Hunnam plays one of the coolest characters I've seen perfectly, Colin Farrell is hilarious and ridiculously cool as well and then Hugh Grant gives one of the best performances I've ever seen from him. In fact Grant was so good I didn't even recognise his voice and had to wonder if they'd dubbed it. They hadn't, he'd just nailed it.",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2020,planktonrules,9," That's Hugh Grant?! It seems so unlike him in his other films!
","Aside from a few very marketable films like ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" and ""Aladdin"", Guy Ritchie is a writer/director who makes incredibly violent films. That is, incredibly violent films which are also brilliantly constructed and near perfect. While I rarely ever watch violent films, I eagerly look for his next dark British crime film, after seeing his ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch""....and so it's not surprising I'd see ""The Gentlemen"". And, like these other films, it's near perfect...and a film you ought to see if you have the stomach for this sort of story.",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2020,sala151183,8," Guy's Best Since Snatch.
","It's Guy Ritchies Best since Snatch, it's where he is most playful and comfortable in a film genre he knows well.
The Cast is perfectly picked, especially Hugh Grant giving a different but yet so funny performance.
Sit back and enjoy 2 hours of a British crime drama, which doesn't take itself too serious
If we hadn't had lock stock or snatch then this would possibly looked at in a more classic Ritchie film so don't expect it to be as great as those.",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2020,muamba_eats_toast,9," Perfect slow burn
",At first I thought it started a little slowly but in hindsight it was just right. A perfect execution of a classic British gangster film epitomised by a charismatic Colin Farrell who stole every scene he entered and left me crying out for a coach spin off. All in all very enjoyable classic guy ritchie film.,/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2020,kosmasp,9," Guy Ritchie
","Yes, I am tempted to say he's back. It's not that he went away or didn't have at least some decent movies over the last few years. I haven't seen Aladdin, but it was succesful sort of. But this is right up his alley! This is pure and enjoyable Guy Ritchie, with timeline cuts and jumps and characters that one may think only he can write.",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2020,boblipton,8," Ritchie Back In Form
","Matthew McConaughey, who has become one of the major players in the British weed trade through science, paying poor noblemen to let him stash his farms on their property, and a judicious amount of leg-breaking, thinks it's time to retire. He offers to sell his business to a fellow entrepreneur for £400,000,000, but other people in the illegal fun trade have their own agendas.",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2020,eelen-seth,9," A ruthless first-class kick in the teeth!
","The rather unconventional visionary Guy Ritchie has been stuck in a Hollywood rut for the last ten years, ever since he committed to big budget, visual effects heavy films, such as Sherlock Holmes, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and this year's underwhelming live action version of the classic Disney, 'Aladdin'. The British director goes back to his roots with the highly entertaining gangster film 'The Gentlemen' and surprisingly nails every bold punch he makes.",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2020,pobratim,10," Guy Richie back to his best
","After seeing the film at an advanced screening I was left pleasently surprised. It is one of the best crime films I have watched and the best from Guy Ritchie...even better than Snatch and Lock Stock, which is something.",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2020,watch_umean,9," I don't understand the critics, this is brilliant.
","The writing, directing, acting and the general production are all top notch. I have not had this much fun watching a movie in a long time. This will go down as a cult classic, so do not miss it.",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2020,Ashraile,9," Snap, Crackle, and Oink
","Whip-smart 1-2-3 dialogue and film-editing, tension, some seriously laugh-out-loud moments, and a killer unorthodox script equals The Gentlemen.",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2020,rainbowzs,8," Hugh Grant is amazing
",Fun film! I was greatly impressed with Hugh Grant's performance. Had to do a double take when he first appeared on the screen. Colin Farrell was a scene stealer and Michelle Dockery makes a great mob wife.,/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2020,johntenneson-44812,10," What an excellent film
",Every now and again I go to the cinema and watch a film that grabs my attention straight away and keeps it right to the end. This is one of those films. What entertainment! Better than anything else I have seen for a considerable time.,/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2020,TxMike,," It's not enough to act like the king, you have to BE the king.
","This is a typical Guy Ritchie movie, there is a story, it isn't always easy to follow, but style is even more important. Matthew McConaughey is American Mickey Pearson who went to England as a young man on a Rhodes Scholarship. He soon learned that he had a knack for selling drugs to fellow students and that eventually blossomed into his vocation on a very broad scale. Now in middle age has decided to sell his marijuana empire, which included a dozen well-hidden farms, and retire to a leisurely life and maybe have a few rug rats with his beautiful and devoted wife. The price? Just 400 million British Pounds.",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2020,classicsoncall,9," ""I'm basing my crescendo on the sum of it's parts.""
","Any Guy Ritchie film I've seen, he always delivers, especially when he's writer and director. This one follows in the tradition of ""Rocknrolla"", ""Snatch"", and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", the story layered with multiple sets of gangsters trying to outdo each other for the grand prize at the end of the flick. I got a kick out of the opening scene in which the bartender pouring Michael Pearson's (Matthew McConaughey) pint pulls down on the bar tap handle reading 'Ritchie Sewing Company', a self promoting piece of business I found pretty clever.",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2020,Her-Excellency,9," For THE film to watch and THE tracksuits to wear in 2020, look no further than The Gentlemen
","In Love Actually, Hugh Grant, who coincidentally also lends his acting talents to The Gentlemen, tells a group of reporters: ""We may be a small country, but we're a great one too. (The) Country of Shakespeare, Churchill, The Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter, David Beckham's right foot ... David Beckham's left foot come to think of it.""",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2020,BA_Harrison,8," Must hold the record for the most frequent use of the 'C' word.
","Having spent a decade or so making Hollywood blockbusters (with varying degrees of success), director Guy Ritchie returns to the genre that first made him famous: Tarantino à la UK. Some might see this as a backwards step, but in my opinion, it's what he does best.",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2020,Kdosda_Hegen,8," Awesome.
","I'm glad Guy Ritchie finally made another of his crime movies once again, it's been awhile. And guess what, it's as good as his other crime comedy movies. It's smart, confusing, well written, unpredictable and funny. Must watch if you love crime comedies.",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2021,Tak005,8," Guy Ritchie at his best
","This is good all the way round and in time should be considered a classic. The core of this movie and its excellence is the story. In classic Guy Ritchie style there are several stories going on within one, all making their twisted way to one unexpected conclusion. There are solid performances from all concerned which adds to the quality. Hugh Grant deserves a special mention as it is like you've never seen him before. If you do not like Ritchie's previous films ""Lock,Stock.."" or ""Snatch"" then you probably won't enjoy it...but if you do, you'll love it...",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv

19 April 2020,alansabljakovic-39044,5," Ritchie lost all of the orginality he once had
","Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is one of my favorite comedies of all time... and The Gentlemen is trying to be that and Snatch but massively fails. The jokes aren't funny, the whole movie's humor is based around racist and sexual jokes... The plot is quite simple and all the characters are unlikeable, like I didn't care for any of the characters. Also, the rape scene was so out of the place. Yes the movie is entertaining but I don't think it adds something new to Ritchie's filmography (feels like recycled stuff from his other movies) and I don't think I will watch this again soon.",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2021,deloudelouvain,10," Ritchie back at what he does the best. Probably his best movie yet.
","After a couple movies that didn't really fitted Guy Ritchie's style and that were a bit disappointing in my opinion, he's finally back at what he does the best. If you liked Snatch, or Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels, you definitely will like The Gentlemen. I thought this one was even better than the two mentioned before. The Gentlemen is a well constructed story that starts slow but that will end in a rollercoaster of emotions. Nice twists, good suspense and action, excellent acting from the entire cast, to me one of the better movies if not the best movie I watched this year and that on the last day of 2020. A perfect ending for a miserable year.",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2020,g_cotterell,9," Razor sharp script
","Richie's best film since snatch. Hugh Grant gives his best performance. He is simply brilliant , funny, little camp, but deadly. Go and watch ASAP.",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2020,kuangzao,8," ebtertaining movie
","This is a remarkably entertaining movie. The twists and turns keep you on your toes and the acting is great.
Good combination of laughs and drama.",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2020,brianjohnson-20043,3," Not my cup of tea
",I wanted to like this film. But I just couldn't. It wasn't comedic to me. And it didn't strike a cord of being a real-life engaging thriller to me either. It's very stylized. And although style can work in certain circumstances when the viewer is appropriately brought on-board. I felt like the plane left without me. A style really doesn't work if the characters become too artificial while trying to play-off an essence of reality at the same time.,/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2020,ultimatew,10," Bloody brilliant.
","This is a bloody brilliant movie.
The cast is perfect. Hugh Grant was a delight and Colin Farrell is again like in Horrible Bosses just showing off.",/review/rw6401396/?ref_=tt_urv
