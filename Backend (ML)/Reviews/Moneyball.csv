30 November 2016,TheLittleSongbird,9," Much more than just a baseball film
","Despite being a non-sports fan, let alone a non-baseball fan, there are still a lot of great sports films out there...of which 'Moneyball' is an example of one.",/review/rw4589054/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,8," Moneyball isn't focussed on just playing Baseball but instead the inner workings of building the greatest team.
","Hundreds of sports films, hundreds of them. Pretty sure Hollywood has tackled every type of sport, including Baseball several times over. Why should this one be any different? Well, this is the true story of the Oakland Athletics to which their General Manager at the time used a new technique of deciding a team: the Moneyball model. Using statistics and logic to pick the most effective players at the cheapest price, therefore building the ultimate economical team. Such a model could change the Baseball industry and negate years of traditional intuition. This is not so much about changing Baseball, but a personal journey for Billy Beane. He himself was chosen to play professionally, ditching his chances of further education. It didn't work out, and so he desired to change the system and defy the industry as a personal vendetta against them. Completely unconventional, having a computer system pick the most suitable players as opposed to listening to veterans who have something that algorithms do not: experience. Thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I can say I have no interest in Baseball (not particularly huge in the UK). A screenplay by Aaron Sorkin was destined to keep me captivated. Every script he writes is filled with sharp, concise dialogue that keeps you hooked on the characters. Brad Pitt looked effortlessly natural, owned every scene he was in. Jonah Hill...get ready guys...I actually liked. Finally!? A film I like him in. Cool, calm and calculated, was perfect at playing a graduate economist. Bennett Miller's direction was clean with a great mixture of old footage of Baseball games with the reconstructed acting. There's a scene towards the end where the result of a game relies on Chris Pratt hitting the ball. When he does...silence. I felt the tingles, was beautifully executed. Whilst the sport of Baseball does not interest me in the slightest, I loved the focus on the team building and thought it was brilliantly acted by everyone.",/review/rw4589054/?ref_=tt_urv

","Moneyball tells the story of the 2002 season of the Oakland Athletics, a team that rose to notoriety because of its low payroll and unorthodox player selection. Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), a former player turned general manage, grows tired with the ancient, inefficient ways of the game he has committed his entire life to. When a transaction goes awry he stumbles across Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a Yale, economics graduate who believes he has a system to rating players based on numbers.",/review/rw4589054/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2011,napierslogs,9," More than a game of numbers
","It has long been said that professional sports are more a game of politics than an actual game. Major League Baseball is not just a game of money, but in ""Moneyball"" it's a game of numbers versus a game of people. It's callousness at its highest when general managers trade away people as if they're objects with little regard for them or their family. Brad Pitt as Billy Beane, the GM of the Oakland As, seems to take that even further, treating people as if they are only numbers, and yet there was something refreshing and humanistic about the whole thing.",/review/rw4589054/?ref_=tt_urv

However, one cannot deny the impact that some have, like for example in recent years The Fighter and Aronofsky's The Wrestler.

2 October 2011,KnightsofNi11,8," A high quality crowd pleaser
","America's pastime has returned to the big screen and it is more witty and elegant than ever. Moneyball is the inspiring story of the Oakland A's, a team that was all but bankrupt but managed to beat the odds through intelligence and perseverance. Brad Pitt plays Billy Beane, the team's general manager who has run out of ideas on how to make his strapped for cash team successful. This is until he meets Pete Brand, played by Jonah Hill, an economic major from Yale. Brand devises a formula that analyzes players in a way nobody else does, thus revealing statistics about players that no one else can see. Beane and Brand use this formula to build up their unlikely roster of misfits. The themes of this film run deep through our aspiring minds. It's a film about beating the odds, going against the current, and standing up for what you believe is right. It is a moving and inspiring film that really only uses baseball as a backdrop for its deeper and more universal themes. It's a moving film and you don't have to be a baseball fan to love it.",/review/rw4589054/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2016,cdjh-81125,8," I Don't Even Like Baseball
","I hate sports, I really do but I love movies and this one peaked my interest and I decided to watch it and I was thoroughly impressed by what I saw. The filmmakers To a really good job of making you care about the success of The Oakland Athletics because they take the time to show you just how bad a state they are in. They also take the time to build the characters so that you understand how important it is for them to succeed. Brad Pitt was fantastic in this film not only did he have some really great one liners but he had a great heart to him you felt sorry for him through seeing his last failings and I really loved his chemistry with Jonah Hill who was also great in this film up until The Wolf of Wall Street this was his best performance ever, I loved his character because he was easy to relate to, that new kid quality does that and I thought Hill did a great job with some of the more emotional scenes. The baseball scenes are filmed terrifically there done in a very documentation style which makes them feel more life like. The relationship between Pitt and his daughter was a really nice touch it made you care more about him and gave you a sense of who he was as a person not just a manager. I liked the fact that they made this film feel real, you completely understand how bad the odds are against this new system, you see them be put down, get angry at defeats and face dismissal and it makes you care all the more about this team succeeding. The late great Phillip Seymour Hoffman was in this movie and he did a great job, I really liked his character he didn't agree with this system and it let you get the series of events from the players perspective and added a more personal touch to the games. I do have a few flaws with this film, for one Chris Pratts character was very wasted, at first it seemed as if they were setting up a good arc for his character but they don't give it the time required to make you care and just ends up being unnecessary. I also thought that they should have taken the time to see the teams success instead of simply shown it in a montage as it didn't give the victories any emotional weight and was an unsatisfactory conclusion to such a good story arc.

","I have another rare chance to catch a film more than a day before its national release. Usually when this happens there's a horde of folks queued up. When the doors to the theatre open, phones are sequestered, and a rush is put on to find prime seating. Those were movies starring a bunch ofÂ… well less than household names. Surely a sneak to see a Brad Pitt movie would be even more chaotic. Unfortunately the waning popularity of America's pastime is as much of a deterrent as a movie star and free entertainment are agents of attraction. ",/review/rw4589054/?ref_=tt_urv

","Moneyball ""changed the game forever"" (the baseball-movie game).

9 January 2012,estebangonzalez10,10," Who thought Baseball and Economics would make an interesting movie?
","Â¨There are rich teams and there are poor teams, then there's fifty-feet of crap, and then there's us. Â¨ Moneyball was among the best films I've seen this year. It really caught me by surprise since I'm not a big baseball fan and wasn't expecting much considering the subject matter. Baseball and economics seemed like a bad combination for me, but since Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman were all starring in this film I had to see it. It's impossible not to fall in love with the Billy Beane character and the relationship he had with his young assistant Peter Brand. They are really the center of this movie so if you're doubting wither or not you should see this worrying about the subject matter all I can say is go see it anyways because it is much more than simply another baseball movie. There are some very strong and emotional scenes where I couldn't help but get goose bumps over a team and a sport I really didn't care for. That is how good this film is. Moneyball is directed by Bennett Miller, who also directed Capote in which Seymour Hoffman won an Oscar for his lead performance as Truman Capote. Miller has proved he can make some great films. The movie was adapted from the book written by Michael Lewis (Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game) which focuses on the true story of the Oakland A's General Manager, Billy Beane, who managed to put together the 2002 team on a very low budget by using computer-generated analysis to draft his players based on a formula which was perfected by his young assistant. This would change the game forever. Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network and Charlie Wilson's War) did a great job at adapting the screenplay for the big screen.",/review/rw4589054/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Moneyball"", directed by Bennett Miller, respects the viewer's intelligence so much it elicits a rather unexpected non-emotional response towards sport. Sure it's one of these movies that are more about the business than the game and one thing for sure, the way odds never work as we expect is part of sports' beauty; still, the film isn't concerned about the beauty of the game.",/review/rw4589054/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. While reading ""Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game"" by Michael Lewis, I never once considered what it might look like as a movie. And I am the kind of guy who looks at a mailbox and wonders if a movie about a mailman might be interesting (Costner proved me wrong). If you are a baseball fan, you should see this movie. If you are not a baseball fan, the movie works very well as a metaphor for any business maverick who takes a risk and analyzes their company or industry from an entirely new perspective.

","In a league where the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox regularly field teams with $100 million-plus payrolls, how do you field a competitive team with a payroll that is a mere fraction of that, at $37 million? This question could have been the basis for a dry documentary, only appealing to a legion of die hard statistical analysis baseball geeks, but instead, it forms the basis of a film that shows a great deal of heart and spirit which moves it into a statement I never thought I would be making, but here goes: Moneyball is possibly the best baseball movie I have I ever seen.",/review/rw4589054/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2011,bjones,," A Home Run
","Well, when purchasing my ticket I expected to see a good movie about 
 baseball. I was rewarded with just that. Overall I thought the film 
 excellent, both as a finely crafted film and as a representative of 
 baseball. To demonstrate that I had no preconceived prejudices, I can 
 say that I'm not really a fan of professional sports any longer. My 
 fond memories of baseball are mostly from playing the game when I was a 
 kid. We lived in a neighborhood with a lot of boys, all of whom were 
 involved in sports and we played baseball a lot. But, that was the 
 1950's and times have changed. No one now days can hold a candle to The 
 Mick.
 
 The film centers around the Oakland A's in the early 2000's and it's 
 controversial General Manager, Billy Beane, skillfully played by Brad 
 Pitt. The premise is the real story of how, with an extremely small 
 budget for a professional sports team, he managed to win a surprising 
 number of games, including setting an all-time major league record of 
 20 consecutive wins. The method used by Beane was not of his invention, 
 having already been around in theory and known as ""sabermetrics"". The 
 crafting of the team into that form is credited to have been begun by 
 Beane's predecessor, Sandy Alderson. Beane himself was thrust to the 
 forefront as the focus of a successful 2003 best-selling book 
 ""Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game""; which ultimately led to 
 this film.
 
 The film was very well done, really succeeding in sucking in the 
 audience to it's ebb and flow. The audience I was in clearly enjoyed 
 the film, there was a lot of laughter in the right places and applause 
 at the end, which is rare enough. The setting had the look and feel of 
 realism and the same with regard to the actors portraying the players. 
 There was a fairly long list of good character actors peppered 
 throughout the film, all of whom added considerably to the film's 
 realism.
 
 But the lion's share of the film, and the credit for it's quality, goes 
 primarily to it's major stars, Brad Pitt, Philip Seymour Hoffman 
 playing Team Manger Art Howe, and Jonah Hill, as the fictional 
 character Peter Brand who is said to have been based on Paul DePodesta 
 who was Beane's assistant during the period covered by the film. 
 Hoffman is great as usual but played his character a bit understated. 
 Jonah Hill nearly ran off with the attention altogether while he was on 
 screen. But Pitt clearly controlled the central attention and did so 
 with ease and excellence. He managed to make the character look smart, 
 fair and quite human.
 
 Pitt's humanity was helped by the presence of tidbits of his family 
 life, mainly focused on his relationship with his 12 year old daughter, 
 well represented on screen by the young Kerris Dorsey as Casey Beane. 
 The interplay between them added a lot of humanity to the film that 
 would have otherwise been lacking. There was a small part played by 
 Robin Wright as Beane's ex-wife Sharon. It was the closest anything in 
 the film came to a romantic involvement.
 
 Many of the character actors made important contributions, such as 
 Stephen Bishop as David Justice, Chris Pratt as Scott Hatteberg and 
 Brent Jennings as Ron Washington. There was even a cameo by Joe 
 Satriani playing his guitar as superbly as usual.
 
 Leaving the theater I thought that one would have to have at least a 
 working knowledge of the game of baseball to get the most out of the 
 film. I wondered how it would play to someone without that knowledge 
 and I think a lot would be lost, but it would still be enjoyable for 
 it's basic story of struggling to overcome long odds to achieve 
 something good and the exploration of the people and personalities 
 involved. That's a pretty good accomplishment for any film to make and 
 this one does it with a lot of fun and class.",/review/rw4589054/?ref_=tt_urv

","As an Australian, the thought of seeing a movie like this a few years ago would have been inconceivable...watching a movie about baseball would be on my ""things not to do"" list...but watching a movie about statistics and baseball? Even more inconceivable! What changed? In the wake of Sri Lanka beating Australia (I think) in the one day cricket World Cup final many years ago (a form of the game that cricket 'purists' would no doubt deride as 'baseball' and not the 'real form' of the game...heaven knows what they now make of of the Twenty20 form of the game!), I did happen upon an article which argued that Sri Lanka had revolutionised this shortened form of the game with their batting tactics. That story intrigued me...I doubt if Sri Lanka's batting strategy was created from statistics or maths, but it was persuasively argued in the article that it had mathematical or statistical logic to it (no doubt with a big helping of common sense too).",/review/rw4589054/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's as patient as a baseball game, and 100 times more engaging. For a movie so focused on numbers and sports analytics, it's incredibly soulful. Miller takes Sorkin's unsurprisingly clever dialogue and surrounds it with long shots of character's still faces, and beds the whole movie on beautifully atmospheric music.

","On recommendation from a friend, I recently saw Moneyball and thought the movie was quite great. The storyline is intriguing to say the least and though a lot of people already know the plot the movie made it come to life. The cast was great and specifically Jonah Hill, who usually does a great job in comedies, should get nominated for best supporting actor in it.

","I have to admit that Moneyball is one unique baseball film. Usually films are about players like Lou Gehrig, Grover Cleveland Alexander, or Dizzy Dean to name three of the most successful players that successful films were made about.

14 June 2015,magnuslhad,9," keeping the faith
","Baseball and submarines: American cinema seems to thrive in these two arenas. Baseball may be a minor sport globally, its rules lost on the vast majority of Europeans, Africans and Asians, but in cinema it lends itself perfectly to myth and grand narrative. Pragmatic GM Billy Beane comes across a nerdy Peter Brand who seems to have worked out an algorithm to get the most effective baseball squad for the lowest cost. This is just what the cash-strapped Oakland franchise needs, decides Beane. Philosophy meets strategy in a perfect pairing, as Billy and Peter go to work implementing 'moneyball' with an almost religious zeal. Pitt brings his now taken-for-granted charisma and complexity to Beane. The casting of Jonah Hill is a gamble that pays off as he manages to give Peter a backbone, when it would be all too easy to lampoon this character. And when you have Philip Seymour Hoffman stepping up to play a small but crucial part, then you have a movie that is intriguing and compelling in equal measure. Very few people have the courage to choose a transgressive path, and of those that do, fewer still will stick with it in the face of adversity. A film of quiet determination, with occasionally explosive conflict, it is at all times humane and authentic. One to watch again and again.",/review/rw4589054/?ref_=tt_urv

","26 September 2011. Surprisingly, this movie is less about the baseball game than the game of baseball. What is striking about this movie (and it's not about outs) is the raw audio sound technique used in this movie that is usually found in documentaries than feature films which helps make this movie come alive. There is a the ambiance of background sound and the echo that seems to resonate and bring the movie closer to the audience and present a much closer to realism experience. There isn't that much actual continuous footage of baseball in this movie, but rather the management of it.
