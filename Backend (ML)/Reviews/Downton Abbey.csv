15 January 2023,steve-valliere,5," Marlow is not an action figure
","Everyone has their interpretation of Philip Marlowe. As for the books that Raymond Chandler gave us, Marlowe is most often more interesting than the characters he encounters, and more interesting than the plot. He is a loner by nature, he's articulate and funny. He plays chess puzzles and reads. He is also tough. His character is what makes you want to come back for more. The movie is fair, but it would be much better if Marlowe were actually in it. This is the eleventh interpretation of this character and it would be such a novelty if at least one would give us the character as he was created by Raymond Chandler.",/review/rw8570524/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,seanmeggesonrp,5," going down a rabbit hole...
",...more like going down a corn hole. A poorly interpreted Marlowe. Robert Mitchum was much better. This dialogue here was muddy and dull. The acting was okay but I really expected much much more given the iconic nature of the material and the legendary status of Raymond Chandler's novel and character. The writing should have been lighter and more vicious. I do think old Hollywood was better portrayed in films like Chinatown. Hard to compete with such classics but Hollywood really does like to eat itself for dinner and then feel satisfied that the fried chicken was too deeply fried in old and rank grease.,/review/rw8570524/?ref_=tt_urv
