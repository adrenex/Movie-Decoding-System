6 June 2021,harrylosborne,3," Season 3: The Impossible Sell
","Aziz Ansari has taken a serious gamble. For this third season, he has scrapped the main characters, the flavour and the overarching story, all to try and tell a more emotionally grounded and empathetic tale.",/review/rw6961666/?ref_=tt_urv

26 June 2021,carobertson95,," Great 1 & 2 season. Season 3 is bad
","We miss little bud, big bud. Eric and Aziz are the best part of the show. Very disappointing having to sit through season 3 just because the title says ""Master of none"". It would make more sense as a completely different show. I honestly wish they could just remove season 3 and try again.",/review/rw6961666/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2021,Jim_Screechy,5," A Spin-Off Would Have Been Better
","Seasons 1&2 have a pretty well established appeal, and the shows in general are quite well regarded. Season three focuses on Denise, the changes in her life & living arrangements and more so, the details surrounding her love life.",/review/rw6961666/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2021,swordsnare,," Season 3
",Different/adjacent stories are necessary. Possibly would have been better to be a new series named 'Moments in Love' rather than the expectation of a story continuation focused around the character 'Dev'. It doesn't seem as though the first two seasons were intended to be a 'Limited Series'?,/review/rw6961666/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2021,jleeharris-36991,6," First two seasons great
","The first two seasons were really great, funny and meaningful. When I started season 3, I had to go to the previous screen to see if I was watching the correct series. It was a complete change of the story. The dance scene in the laundry room was cute, but it just wasn't interesting after that. It wasn't funny.",/review/rw6961666/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2021,nancybw,5," Two Great Seasons Negated
","By an absolute snore fest of a third season. If you were going to make something completely different then . CALL IT SOMETHING ELSE. This is what happens when some creative people get rich and powerful and decide they can do anything. No, just no.",/review/rw6961666/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2021,thompsjf,2," Season 3 is a total snooze fest!!! A big let down from the first two seasons
","I truly do not understand the audience they were going for. Season 3 is a total snooze fest. It is slow as molasses in January. It is a total departure from the first two seasons. I understand the ""Art House"" style Ansari was going for, but please do not bore your audience. He should have just stated a new TV series and not ""bait and switched"" us with this show, calling it ""Master of None"". You have been warned, your patience watch these five episodes will not be rewarded.",/review/rw6961666/?ref_=tt_urv

24 May 2021,mjhzzz,1," Season 3 absolutely horrible in so many ways

","What is going on these days? I used to watch this show to LAUGH and as an escape from my everyday. I stopped watching within the first 5 minutes because it was painfully obvious this wasn't the same as season 1 and 2. It's incredible that i can't escape my everyday with my entertainment anymore. STOP TELLING ME TO THINK LIKE YOU. I stop listening the moment someone tells me how to think. Good God! Enough already. Get back to entertaining us. You are comedians, not Buddha. Get over yourselves.",/review/rw6961666/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2015,politically_incorrect204,10," Warm and Funny
","If you've seen Aziz's latest comedy special this show will not surprise you. In his latest special Aziz was both funny and clever while at other times vulnerable and thoughtful. I would say his humanity, warmth, and huge talent for being funny come out in this show in spades. And as it should since I'm guessing it's only a slightly different version than real events he's gone through on his own. There have been many comparisons to Louie and I would agree that the style of the show is similar but what makes it different is the completely different perspectives that Aziz and Louie have. Even in his stand up there's this boyish charm and innocence that Aziz has and that comes out in this show. Many of the funniest moments are Aziz being boyish and charming. He's not convince all is evil, he still sees the the best in things but is sometimes nagged by pessimism and doubt whereas Louie tends to think everything is crap and is pleasantly surprised when there is humanity left in people. All and all this show is well worth watching if you want something that is mostly funny but also has some poignant and touching moments. I agree that the last 3 or so episodes take a less funny and more drama tone but I don't think that's a bad thing. I felt like this show almost felt like an Aziz diary. He wanted to portray the things he has obviously thought about and bring to light certain social issues that have given him pause. Lastly the supporting cast is awesome. It's nice to see Eric Wareheim actually be funny as the Tim and Eric Awesome Show is pretty awful in my opinion. You got to see him be much more of a human here and be really funny while at times poignant as well. The rest of the supporting cast was great too. Although Claire Danes being in a couple episodes felt a bit odd. Regardless a show worth watching and perfectly worth binging on!",/review/rw6961666/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,nfpritchard,," Season 1&2 are great. Season 3- so sloowwww
",The first and second seasons are great. The third season is so slow and drags. More comic moments and levity desperately needed. Don't watch the third season unless you need sleep.,/review/rw6961666/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2021,wainscoat-1,1," Season 3: What was Aziz thinking?
","I was a huge fan of seasons 1 and 2 - which I still recommend as original, insightful, and funny. In fact, I rank Master of None (S1 and S2) in my top 5 Netflix series. Master of None - season 3, however, ranks as the worst Netflix show I have ever seen.",/review/rw6961666/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2021,linear-descent,6," Season 3 was so disappointing. Such a letdown
","I loved Season 1. Season 2 was a decent follow up. Not as great as the first but still funny and engaging and thoughtful enough that I was anxiously looking forward to see what Season 3 had to offer. Well... Season 3 is a total letdown. You're just left wondering ""what happened to this great show?""",/review/rw6961666/?ref_=tt_urv

7 April 2018,lesleyharris30,9," A Massively Unconventional, Funny, Meaningful Series,
","Master of None is a terrific television series with very well written episodes and an excellent cast that are capable of going from zany comedy to sincere effortlessly. It is not at all what I expected from Aziz Ansari, it is so much richer and more developed than anything I have seen him do previously, Netflix clearly gave him freedom to do what he wanted and he did not hold back for a second. The cast and crew clearly made the effort to make every episode stand out and never having one be like another, and you can see this. While there is great plotlines that continue over the course of the first two seasons, there are also out there episodes, like one that follows Dev on multiple dates, and another that follows a whole host of new characters from different parts of their town, the show continued to surprise me.
