8 March 2022,julieshotmail,8," Fargo-esque with two very likable leads
","""The Tourist"" has a very ""Fargo"" feel to it, set in the vast open fields of Australia which makes it the more fascinating. Starting out with action and a mystery, this short series has enough eclectic elements to keep you captivated. First, there is a mysterious guy, followed by a very sympathetic ""cop,"" delightfully played by Danielle Macdonald. This actress is the biggest revelation here. Danielle portrays the character with so much heart that every scene with her character Helen just shines. More quirky characters are introduced, notably the American cowboy played by an Icelandic actor, the detective, and the cop trainee. The plot does get convoluted but loose ends are still tightened up so you don't lose your grip. The cinematography, camera work, and editing do justice to the sweeping Australian Outback beauty. Best of all, there is some snide dark humor that's quite enjoyable from characters that you least expect to be funny in real life.",/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2022,paul2001sw-1,8," Ambitious, clever and uneven
","'The Tourist' begins when a man wakes up after a car crash in the Australian outback unable to remember who he is, and a viewer might think they're about to watch a familiar kind of drama series. Instead, what follows is uncommonly inventive, in terms of both plot and presentation, frequently blackly comic but just as frequently, plain black. The protagonists vary between those who are purely evil, those who seem decent but with unforgiveable histories, and a few nice guys who mostly don't last very long. By design, it's tonally uneven, though persistantly creative and clever.",/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2022,SnoopyStyle,7," endearing Danielle Macdonald
",A man (Jamie Dornan) is run off the road by a truck in the Australian outback. He wakes up in a hospital with amnesia. This series may be a limited series. I don't know if there is going to be a second series. Most of it is wrapped up although there is a thread or two if the show wants to continue. Jamie Dornan is the big name and he does well as the lead. The more compelling performer is the endearing Danielle Macdonald. She plays the Frances McDormand role in Fargo and reminds me a lot of Merritt Wever. She really needs to be the co-lead of this show and her getting left behind is felt in a couple of episodes. I would modify some of her dialogue in the last two episodes. She sounds a bit too schoolgirl-like. This starts with an interesting premise and Macdonald becomes its heart. It's a good short series and who knows if they're coming back for seconds.,/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,randymcbeast,9," This one is special
",I was absolutely loving this mini series. The first five episodes were brilliant and this was easily headed for a 10. The final episode was a bit choppy though and knocked it down from perfection but it did manage to finish strong.,/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2022,godsnames,8," It's a slow burner, but man, wow! Powerful as hell
","I do not want want to go into serious details about this, mostly because it just hitting the 8 out of 10 mark for me with basically everything. Story, script, acting, dialogues, camerawork, score, all making it way above average. However, the female lead, the policewoman Danielle Macdonald, is a revelation. She manages to be extremely cute and horribly annoying at the same time. In that case, I reckon, I also have to give credit to the director. The conclusion of the story is profoundly shocking. What a ride!",/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2022,gladys64,8," Only let down by episode 5
",A good solid thriller. So many twists. Just when you think you've Sussed it your served another curve ball. Top notch acting from all the cast. Especially the guy and the police woman. Was sceptical at the start as it's an Aussie drama but this show cased our Australian talent very well. Amazing scenery of course. Ending was so good and unexpected and I hope that tiny thread at the end means there will be a season 2. Episode 5 was just too much and too convoluted that I just wanted it to be over. I understand it was an episode that pulled stuff together to a certain extent but it could have been done in a better way. Watched the whole series over 2 nights as we wanted to see where the next twist took you.,/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2022,rich-mac,8," Builds momentum
","I was drawn to this show when I noticed Damon Herriman (Justified, Mr Inbetween) was in it - for me he's usually a signpost that something good is going on.",/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,mgumsley,8," Something Different
","This series features Jamie Dornan, so i figured it had to be worth a watch, and for the most part, it has been. I couldn't even begin to explain the plot, which is so convoluted I would get lost, but for the most part it has been an entertaining ride, with car chases, shoot outs, and perhaps best of all some really engaging characters. I say engaging in the loosest sense, because poor old Jamie has amnesia, which isn't very helpful considering the trouble he is in. One of the ladies, Helen the unlikely cop, is an absolute scene stealer with a bumbling manner and a cute face, and good though Dornan is, once she is on the screen your eyes are on her. There are other memorable characters, notably the Icelandic actor whose name I can never pronounce, who is a bit of a scene stealer as a horrible villain.",/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2022,irnbru-333,7," Intriguing outback thriller that draws you in and holds you till the end
","An Australian set and shot thriller from the Williams brothers, (Liar, The Missing, Baptiste etc.) with the excellent Jamie Dornan.",/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2022,ianlouisiana,9," Thank Heaven for Little Pearls....

incomprehensible thriller.",/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2022,dmerrill-537-56275,8," Not what you're expecting. Excellent!
","How many times did I look at the guy leaning on the car, the title Tourist and read the description before i decided to watch this? It had to be like 8 times. When i read the description, I thought Duel. When I looked at the title and pic, it just didn't seem like anything. For some reason i finally clicked the button and tarted the first episode. I'm really glad I did. All of the things you first engage with doesn't do this mini-series justice.",/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2022,neil-douglas2010,8," Decent Aussie based thriller.
","Very easy to binge watch thriller serial, Doran is good as the main character but the star of the show is Danielle MacDonald as wannabee Police Officer Helen Chambers. Well paced at all times and Miss Fisher Murder Mysteries fans look out for a small cameo role from Nathan Page.",/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,a_prill,8," A pretty good attempt at an Australian Fargo.
","Despite a few clunky plot points it's a very engaging story and the two main actors are wonderful, especially Danielle MacDonald. We had a great weekend binging it.",/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2022,bgsmall,8," A thrilling, but occasionaly dark journey
","Caught on BBC iPlayer over January. This was ostensibly sold to the viewer as a drama, but it was a drama that really utilised the full range of human experience and emotion. Opening as a thriller in which we're tyring to work out who the 'unknown man' is and why 'they' are trying to kill him, it progresses via some cunning plot twists, veering between occasional comedy, suggested romance and then towards some dark, dark and tragic corners of what human beings are capable of.",/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2022,arrmeen,8," Slow burner but a good ride
","This is one of the shows which isn't a Reacher going frame to frame with Pacy action and thrill in a heartbeat , it's not fully loaded with action completely but it doesn't let you stop from binging it either cause of the story elements and the thrill. The characters playing their part, The Man, The lady cop, The mystery girl, and the Cowboy executioner all play their parts to perfection. By the time it ends it's first season you definitely want a second season. So watch this for it's unique story, presentation and cinematography and you won't be disappointed. Worth a a season 2.",/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,justahunch-70549,9," I wish there had been an episode 7!
","Not perfect, but quite the trip down a rabbit hole with two wonderful performances and some fine supporting ones as well. This tale of a man who suffers amnesia, after a car crash, trying to find out who he is while others seem to want him dead is a fun thrill ride full of oddball characters that entertain throughout. Danielle Macdonald is a charming delight from start to finish, however Jamie Dornan is the focal point and he is captivating as a man mystified, surprised and puzzled by everything presented to his thoroughly blank mind. It's a tough role to pull off, but this increasingly fine actor makes it work.",/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2022,Zomabur,8," Entertaining!
",Firstly I don't understand why people write reviews of a series when they haven't seen or have 'no intention of watching' every episode.,/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2022,wheatley-20230,7," An enigmatic story ...
",... which leaves me less than certain as to what to think of this series. Unusual characters in quirky situations is a promising start. Jamie Dornan's presence elevates whatever he is in. Australia's threatening landscape adds flavour.,/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2022,gallagherkellie,6," Please have a shower
",Ok as an Australian I am slightly embarrassed for international people to watch this as it isn't a true representation of Australia or Australians. But I'm hoping everyone realised this.,/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2022,sallye-65221,8," Really rather good
","I'm not entirely sure if I'm reviewing the same thing, looking at most of the others who are panning it. The characters are great and well cast...with a bit of humour here and there. Possibly Brit and Aussie humour that some wouldn't appreciate or get. It is laughing at certain stereotypes in a humorous way.",/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2022,walttechbc,9," Good entertainment
","Unlike some,I don't pick apart a series or movie because I strictly watch it for entertainment. True stories or documentaries,I mostly watch for info,education,or because I'm interested in the subject. I also read many history books.",/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2022,sameldenlee,8," Everyone's seems to be missing the humour!
","Great mini series. Jamie Dornan is a great actor. I first saw him in The Fall, his brooding presence and hints of psychopathy in this gave me nightmares for a while. He has the ability to convey what lies beneath his exterior just with a look. The fifty shades series sadly did not allow him to show his full potential and was a dire set of films based on a dire set of books.",/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,jewellz48,8," Quirky and compelling , but flawed
","I enjoyed this a lot. Good pacing, interesting story, and well acted. I also enjoyed the setting in the Outback. I do think the story got a bit convoluted and complicated. I liked the mystery around The Man's identity, but thought that the unraveling of his previous life was a bit rushed, especially the reveal at the end. I would have liked to see his previous life a little more fleshed out and dimensional. It never really felt like he actually had those experiences. But I enjoyed what they did show, and especially appreciate the odd bits of humor sprinkled throughout. Worth a watch.",/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2022,c-pemberton1,8," Atmospheric Aussie Drama
",Twists and turns through a desolate Aussie landscape keeping you guessing all the way til the end. Amnesia victim Jamie Dorman is on someone's hit list but who is he and what has he done to get this attention. No one is what they seem in this Aussie acid trip. Slow burner that draws you in and intrigues you all the way. Interesting characters and some stylish photography keep you watching. Really enjoyed this quirky series.,/review/rw7722842/?ref_=tt_urv
