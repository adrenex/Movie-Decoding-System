12 June 2018,jaredpahl,7," Spielberg Magic, This Is Not. Still, a Visit to Jurassic World Is Worth the Price of Admission.
","You may have heard some critics champion Jurassic World as ""The best Jurassic Park sequel"", some fans declare that it ""brought them back to their childhood"", and others who may have made the absurd claim, ""It's better than the original"". Don't believe the hype. Jurassic World is nowhere close to the best Jurassic Park sequel (Spielberg's own, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, will always have that title). It is not going to bring you back to your childhood, and it doesn't hold a candle to what Steven Spielberg and crew accomplished with the original Jurassic Park. That being said, in a time of dark, self-serious, and pretentious blockbusters such as last year's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes or Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight films, Jurassic World is a refreshing antidote. Light, wholesome, and heavy on adventure, JW harkens back to the big Hollywood ""event"" blockbusters of the 80s and 90s. Let's just not pretend this is anything groundbreaking. The fourth Jurassic Park movie remembers to have fun with its premise, but Spielberg's magic touch is still sorely missed.",/review/rw3421976/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2015,TheLittleSongbird,7," Not a patch on the original Jurassic Park, and is an uneven film, but by far the best of the sequels
","The original Jurassic Park still is a personal favourite, it is an enormously fun, thrilling (with some nail-biting moments) and brilliantly made film, with one of John Williams' most memorable main themes and scene-stealing dinosaurs. The Lost World has its admirers, but for me it was a major step-down and one of Spielberg's weakest films, and Jurassic Park 3 was even more disappointing.",/review/rw3421976/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2015,mmcgee282,10," Great 3D movie
","This film combines the stories taken from king Kong and The lost world,25 version.Bryce Dallas Howard Plays a Bitchy corporate executive ,who can't get with her nephews on Christmas holidays ,played by TY Simpkins and Nick Robinson, that her sister has sent them for visit,played by Judy Greer.Bryce works for a huge corporate amusement park that focuses on dinosaurs.Bryce can't make time for her nephews,so they wonder on their own.She a a troubled working and personal relationships with a dinosaur trainer and activist play by new movie star Chris Prat.Though owner and designer of the a park Irrfan Kahn ,who is more concerned about people having fun than how much profit has increased.Chris has a problem working relationship with Vincent.Vincent believes that the dinosaurs should focus on killing each other ,but, Chris believes they should be trained for peace.Well, there is one dinosaur that was create artificially ,for a new part of the park ,to be open soon.I call him T.Rex Kong. A problem arises he not following instructions and eats another dinosaur .All hell breaks loose when he jumps the wall and terrorizes the customers the customer of the park making a nice meal out of some of the worker and security guards .The dinosaurs were so realistic and were digitally created . Earlier Jurissic Park had used some puppets .The movie is made in style of an amusement park .It seems that the character development is shorter for the sake of the action.In some out takes that was shown ,flat, indicated that may be some of the shots should have been kept of the character development.It was not even.Did you see the little old fashion camera that the smaller nephew was carrying?could indicate Hollywood dislike towards home digital cameras?Chis originally did a you tube joke about him getting a job in Spielberg's next Jurassic movie .I think it was you tube.His dreams came true. Another problem was that the characters and the whole atmosphere of the movies and sets were cold and stoic.Even the kissing scene was cold and the family reunion scene,which Claire's sisters husband was played by Andy Buckley, was also not warm..E.T ,Poltergeists and Star Wars was far more Warmer.What's the problem?I am afraid it's a real world currently problems in general.Hollywood has always pretentiously serve the establishment ,for profit,then claims they serve the masses.This movie reflects our phony liberal side of big business and the wealthy running our government and exploiting the animal rights and environmentalist ,who are desperate for a quick answer to protect animals and the environment as well a s fanatics and those who have a contempt against the human race ,due to constant warmongering ,for profit and political power.This reflects pitting animals and the environment against humans ,very subtle, in this film,but,this is an outer problem.In spite of this it is an excellence film,Gorgeous sets and realistic dinosaurs ,Bryce in her 1970's hair do,which has become popular again and handsome leading man Chris Pratt.I was certainly satisfied with this movie.Both 3D and flat were good. The sound was arousing and excellent .No out of synchronizing problems here,since both images are in a folder stabled .Great for Dino fans and 3D fans. 10/21/15",/review/rw3421976/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2016,Enchorde,6," Diluted ideas with good action
","It is quite easy to sum this up, it's another Jurassic Park. There is the same misguided attempt at growing dinosaurs for a theme park. Some or all of the dangerous dinosaurs will escape and go on a killing Spree. And finally, yes, some kids will end up in the middle of it. Knowing that, it delivers what is expected. The effects are really good (it feels wrong to call them realistic when they're creating dinosaurs) and the action is evenly spread throughout the movie. The entertainment was good.",/review/rw3421976/?ref_=tt_urv

","I knew right from the get-go that this would not be as good as the original 1993 masterpiece. The only thing I wondered was if it would be in the same league. Although not as good, it is inferior by little. Although not a masterpiece, I call it a ""near-masterpiece"" like The Outsiders and The Aviator.",/review/rw3421976/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2015,Figgy66-915-598470,10," Another watchable instalment
","17 June 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Jurassic World. Let's just say I'm a BIG fan of these movies, right from the minute we saw Sir Richard Attenborough clutching that cane with the amber head, I was hooked. I don't care that it's fiction and highly improbable, what matters is that these films take me to another land and in many ways another time.....65 million years ago to be precise. To be honest there wasn't anything terribly new in this film, two children, a rugged hero type, a woman running around in her high heels and a man with an alternative agenda. What we did get however, was dinosaurs on our side, and I love that. As portrayed in the film, the public want bigger, scarier attractions and a film going audience in a sense want that too. In this film however, we got more of the thinking man's dinosaur and a gaggle of well meaning people whose intentions were good but misplaced, a a couple of characters who really need to get eaten. I watched it in 3D, and I'm selective about the films I watch in 3D these days, but I have to say I was pretty darn good. Wouldn't mind watching it again......oh and Chris Prattt.....yum.",/review/rw3421976/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2015,PWNYCNY,10," A great science fiction movie, a take off on the Frankenstein story. Total mayhem on the screen.
","This movie is about what happens when people dabble in areas of research that are best to be left alone. It is about what happens when military and business interests conspire to engage in projects without any outside controls. It is about what happens when people become smug and complacent to the point of recklessness. It is about what happens when science is perverted for the sake of profit. It is about what happens when caution is tossed into the wind. It is about what happens when nature is violated. It is about what happens when freaks of nature are produced for all the worst reasons. It is about what happens when the scientist loses his moral compass. It is about the arrogance of man. It is about the consequences of unrestrained materialism. This movie contains all the elements of a great science fiction movie. First, it has an excellent and highly inventive story. The idea of dinosaurs working with humans is engaging. Its rationale as explained in the movie is not beyond the realm of plausibility. Second, the special effects are spectacular. The movie contains numerous scenes depicting many different species of dinosaurs, some friendly, some lethal. Third, the dinosaurs are not demonized. Instead, they are portrayed as creatures who are being manipulated. Fourth, the story includes good guys and bad guys. Fifth, the action is nonstop. The principle characters are literally running throughout the movie. Sixth, the script includes many clever and corny lines that evoke laughter. Seventh, the movie dramatizes what happens when safety is sacrificed for profit. The cast is excellent. Vincent D'Onfrio is especially strong as the head of park security who is actually a sell out for the profiteers. But the biggest star are the special effects which in this movie are entirely necessary and in no way gratuitous. For this movie to succeed as a drama, it has to be able to depict the total mayhem and terror caused by the irresponsible conduct of those who sacrificed the public good to make a quick buck. One other point: This movie succeeds in drawing from other great science fiction movies, like Predator, Frankenstein and Jurassic Park to produce an original, unique and powerful dramatic story.",/review/rw3421976/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2015,Leofwine_draca,6," One heck of a mixed bag
","As a huge fan of the original JURASSIC PARK - I was twelve years old when I saw it in 1993, pretty much the perfect age - I was eager to check out this all-new and revamped sequel/update/reboot of the premise. At the same time, I pretty much dismissed memories of the previous two sequels, which were entirely forgettable and sub-par popcorn flicks. The new JURASSIC WORLD is one heck of a mixed bag as a film. It contains many, many flaws and parts I hated, alongside some good moments that I enjoyed. It's very similar to the new TERMINATOR GENISYS in that respect, although an improvement over the Schwarzenegger movie. The good parts of JURASSIC WORLD are invariably those which involve the dinosaurs; when the dinos are on screen, the film is fun; when they're off, it's a failure.",/review/rw3421976/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2015,Anurag-Shetty,10," An instant classic that lives up to the original and improves upon it.
","Jurassic World is set 22 years after the events of Jurassic Park(1993). Jurassic World is a fully functioning dinosaur theme park & has fully realized John Hammond's dream all those years back, of creating such a spectacle(John Hammond appeared in Jurassic Park, played by the wonderful Richard Attenborough). Jurassic World has been in operation for about ten years. However, the theme park's visitors have been steadily losing interest in the dinosaurs, over the years. The scientists who have created these dinosaurs come up with a plan to reignite visitors' interest in the park. On the order of the chief executives who own Jurassic World, the scientists create a new & terrifying genetically modified dinosaur to up the 'scare & wow' factor of Jurassic World & bring the park to its former glory. Unfortunately, this new 'attraction' escapes. Now, it is up to a dinosaur handler named Owen(Chris Pratt) & Claire(Bryce Dallas Howard), one of the head employees at Jurassic World, with help from the technical team of Jurassic World to find & stop the dinosaur before all hell breaks loose at the park.

","Dull, cliche ridden, hackneyed, predictable, stupid and those are the reasons I give it a 3 instead of lower. The characters do predictable stupid things over and over.. Is there danger? Yes so RUN OUT IN THE OPEN instead of going inside. As the dino's are attacking we see people running OUT of buildings right into the path of the toothy dinos.",/review/rw3421976/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a film for families, like all Jurassic movies so far, so they have to use a pseudo-family unit as the main character. They also have to tell you how to feel at every moment with blunt soundtrack bits that leave nothing to the imagination. The evil corporation, the arrogant rich man, the uncaring secretary and the opportunist need all be punished for their sins. Not so the sexy redhead who got everybody killed in the first place or the annoying children who do whatever they feel like it while a killer dino is on the loose .

","People really are too serious these days, Jurrasic World is a fun exciting thrilling film and a I really enjoyed it a I feel like I've waited almost all my life for another Jurrasic Park type film to be realised and I'm so happy they did! All these negative reviews are actually sad what did people expect? The film is obviously going to be slightly similar to the others there's only so much you reasonably can do. Anyway I loved this film I literally cried at the end everyone in the cinemas was clapping clearly we all enjoyed it. I'm a die hard fan of the jurrasic parks and maybe because I loved all the other films so much this was just brilliant it brought me back to my childhood made me remember why I loved them films so much there so exciting and entertaining and it makes you feel all the emotions. This is what I want when I go to see a movie I want to feel the emotions I want to be excited. I mean I literally haven't stopped talking about this film since I saw it. I love Jurrasic World, best film in ages.",/review/rw3421976/?ref_=tt_urv

A girl changes her shoes and/or shirt and becomes a superwoman in about 30 seconds, instantly gets expertise in gymnastics, combat, weapons handling, strategy and kills monsters together with a handsome guru (although the monsters had no problem with killing 1000 heavily armed troopers.

13 June 2015,baehr_adam,10," Pratt+Blackwater+Dinosaurs= A Masterpiece
","OMG I don't even know where to start. I will start I suppose by saying this is in my opinion the Best movie in the series thus far and I know there will be a debate about this but that is how I feel. I watched it in IMAX 3D. I will start with the story which is basic it's about the park finally being opened to tourists after twenty plus years and everything going to Hell. I loved the pacing of the movie though because it doesn't just start with guns blazing it's a slow sizzle to some Fantastic set pieces in cinematography. I would also like to note that they had everything you would want to see in terms of tourists interacting with the park and enjoying it before the fun begins. I would compare it to ""28 Weeks Later"" and them settling down before the Zombie outbreak starts. I will move on to the acting which was very well done Chris Pratt killed it as Owen and was by far the star of the movie. I also have to mention Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire and also Vincent D' Onofrio who played Hoskins. I also enjoyed the banter between the brothers in the movie. Overall they all did a wonderful job of bringing life to the movie. I will now move onto the final part which is the action. I absolutely fell in love with the action set-pieces they were utilized perfectly and not overused. I can only compare it to Godzilla 2014 in terms of fight scenes between the Dinosaurs. I must say that once Blackwater or AKA InGen soldiers came into the mix I was sold. I will say this without spoiling anything that they had a nostalgic scene with Raptors just like the scene in ""The Lost World"". I will close by saying that if you are debating on watching this movie just GO and watch it and I guarantee that you will love it. The final fight scene was Phenomenal.",/review/rw3421976/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2015,Zulfmanauthor,10," A Monster-sized adventure !
","The emergence of another 'Jurassic Park' sequel after the failure of 'Jurassic Park III' was bound to open the movie to criticism as exploring the world of dinosaurs seems to have been exhausted. However 'Jurassic World' doesn't try to be anything new, in fact it goes back to the original movie and adds on a few tasty elements. The film is set twenty two years after the original park was closed down after the disastrous events, and an Indian tycoon has now invested in a bigger and better park. However events take a disastrous turn once again due to genetically created experiments that are taking place behind the scenes. The story is good but not too inventive and the action sequences are breath-taking, whereas predictably some of the characters are abit two dimensional. The film is huge and highly enjoyable whether you are a fan of 'Jurassic Park' movies or not, this is old fashioned mayhem. In fact it is much better then the highly rated 'Godzilla' movie from 2014, which never got going. Jurassic World does what a great sequel should do, which is to take what the original had and change a few things while adding on a few sub-plots. Take the family and settle down to a a couple of hours of summer movie fun!",/review/rw3421976/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2015,zardoz-13,2," Pathetic Compared to Spielberg's ""Jurassic Park"" Entries
","""Safety Not Guaranteed"" director Colin Trevorrow's summer blockbuster ""Jurassic World"" surpasses director Joe Johnston's lackluster ""Jurassic Park 3"" (2001). Comparatively, Steven Spielberg's infinitely superior ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) covered most of what transpires in Trevorrow's new the monster-run-amok-in-a-theme-park movie. Despite its attractive cast and scenic jungle locations, ""Jurassic World"" delivers considerably less suspense in its standard-issue shenanigans about juveniles in jeopardy. If you haven't seen the first and second entries in the ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy, this franchise reboot with its polished production values and robust 3-D might amaze you, especially if you're sixteen years old or younger. Size is the primary factor ""Jurassic World"" contends with, and Trevorrow shrewdly addresses this liability during the first half-hour. The female protagonist who manages the dinosaur park concedes, ""No one's impressed by a dinosaur anymore. They need to be bigger, louder and with more teeth!"" Indeed, the new hybrid dinosaur that a fiendish scientist has concocted represents a leap forward. Nevertheless, this 50 feet long and 18 feet high monster doesn't really emerge as that monstrous. The Indominus rex in ""Jurassic World"" could serve as ""Godzilla's"" seeing-eye dog. Moreover, ""Jurassic World"" appears to have been designed to sell plastic toy dinosaurs. The dinos themselves display a clean-scrubbed, laminated look. When the franchise first rampaged across screens with ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) and its sequel ""Jurassic Park: The Lost World"" (1997), nothing looked either more realistic or intimidating than those truculent dinosaurs, especially the Raptors. Unfortunately, the time when ""Jurassic Park"" set new benchmarks for CGI is long past. The people who made ""Jurassic World"" must have ignored Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" (2005) as well as ""Godzilla"" (2014). In an arena with either of those, the welterweight Indominus rex in ""Jurassic World"" wouldn't last a minute. ",/review/rw3421976/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2015,CalRhys,," Worthy Sequel To One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made
","Let's start this by stating how much of a die hard fan I am of 'Jurassic Park', I love that film, always have, always will. 'The Lost World' is a worthy followup, but at the same time lost the panache the first one had, as for the third entry, I'll overlook it because it just got too silly for my liking... anyway, on to 'Jurassic World'. First of all, the positives outweigh the negatives by far, so to start I shall begin with the flaws. 'Jurassic World' near enough scraps the use of animatronics that made the original films so realistic in comparison and instead overuses CGI, but that aside the visual effects are stunning. And the story, well, it's a little too far-fetched to say the least, but not to the point where it's completely ridiculous, just enough for you to have a laugh but still enjoy it nonetheless. Trevorrow's direction, Pratt's acting and Giacchino's score are all superb, and these combined make the film a worthy watch. The film perfectly blends drama, emotion and action, and when I say action, I mean full-on awe- inspiring action. The closing battle is just rife with intensity, to the extent that I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat in the cinema, it was perfectly choreographed (if maybe a tad predictable) but my heart was racing, I hadn't felt that excited with a film's conclusion for a long time. All-in-all, it's a well- executed and beautifully-crafted sequel, but will never outdo the original, the best 'Jurassic Park', but a second spot grab? I think so.",/review/rw3421976/?ref_=tt_urv
