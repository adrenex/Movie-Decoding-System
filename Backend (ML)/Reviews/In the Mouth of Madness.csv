3 December 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," Funnier than the first one
","The Brady Bunch Movie that was released a couple years prior to A Very Brady Sequel was a decent success. The movie was actually pretty funny, I was obsessed with it when I was a kid. As I grew up, there was a flaw that I found with the film, the point of that film was to show how the Brady's were so different from the world and the real life family, no matter what decade. The Brady Bunch Movie was missing one main thing, the reactions from others around them. So A Very Brady Sequel, that's not only what they did, but they did it extremely well and this movie is one of the funniest comedies that you will ever see.",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2010,planktonrules,8," What's not to love about this film?!
","I hated the original ""Brady Bunch""--the show was totally saccharine and about as edgy as a basketball! When the Brady movie came out in 1995, I was thrilled--as the saccharine Brady family was gone and the movie had a wonderful way of making fun of itself. Because of this good-natured lampoon, I was excited to see the sequel--and it did not disappoint--being MUCH better, even, than the previous film.",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2004,liammurphy1,," Groovy!
",This quick cash-in sequel to the 1995 Brady Bunch Movie is surprisingly really quite good - The wonderfully tongue-in-cheek Shelley Long and Gary Cole make this worth watching just for their performances alone and the story is quite good if a little far-fetched. Tim Matheson stars as Shelley Long's EX-Husband or is he? If your feeling low - this movie will certainly bring a smile to the face if nothing else!,/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2005,ruinously,7," Well performed.
","A Very Brady Sequel is a very good movie. All the actors did well here, especially Shelly Long, Gary Cole, Jennifer Elise Cox and Tim Mathieson. The funny situations, quotes, tone and style of this movie help hide the fact that not all that much really happens and the premise of this film is absurd.",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2003,Not2Ghetto420,," Uproarious!
","This movie is one of the funniest films I've ever seen.  Way better than the first which is very unlikely.  This movie just makes you laugh from the first frame to the very last.  Not much more to say, a perfect comedy.",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 1999,G-Man-25,," A Good Sequel
","If you were a fan of the first ""Brady Bunch Movie,"" you'll probably find this sequel enjoyable as well.  The whole cast has now slipped effortlessly into their roles (especially Gary Cole's absolutely spot-on mannerisms of Robert Reed/Mike Brady)  The story and jokes this time tend to start petering out near the end, but on the whole there are enough laughs, satiric jabs and nostalgic winks to inspire good will towards the whole film. It's fluff, to be sure....but entertaining fluff.",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv

","Just a year after the original comes out, they make a follow-up, which is just as good as the original. ",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2007,fedor8,," A cheerful comedy that is actually funny.
","A sequel that's even better than the first part is a rare occurrence, even more fun than the first film. Once again, it's Jennifer Elise Cox who steals the show with a number of hilarious moments. This overlooked actress has (or had?) the potential to be another Goldie Hawn, but, alas, the major hindrance in her career going forward is that she isn't a Spelling, a Coppola, an Arquette, a Fonda, or a Barrymore. Having lack of powerful family connections is a truly unforgivable crime, and probably a major reason why she didn't make a breakthrough. If Drew Barrymore, for example, had 5% of her talent, she'd be the no.1 female star in the past 2 decades. I don't think much of child and teen actors, but Cox is possibly the funniest teenager I have ever seen in a movie, and one of the funniest actresses, as well. Her semi-retarded, ultra-naive facial expressions, so perfectly suited to this role, and her delivery of lines are absolutely perfect. Matheson is also very good, as is the guy playing the oldest son.",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2005,jwfisher-1,9," A Very Underrated Movie
","This satiric sequel is a rare exception--it's better than the original. Highlights include Jan's made-up boyfriend, George Glass, Marcia and Greg's awkward sexual attraction, a cameo by Zsa Zsa Gabor and Rosie O'Donnel, not one but TWO musical dance numbers, Marcia's obvious wig in her scene at the pool, Jan losing her contact lens while driving, Mr. and Mrs. Brady's hilariously obvious sexual innuendo, Alice's spaghetti with ""special mushrooms,"" the family trip to Hawaii, and the (brief) return of Tiger, the dog. There's a lot more funny stuff too!",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv

1 October 2004,SajeevaS,," And still more 'Brady-ier'
","There are some movies, that just do not deserve sequels, but this was NOT one of them. Again even in this, we see the family of the 70's stuck in the 90's Â– completely outdated and completely clueless.",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2015,Wuchakk,8," Greg and Marcia discover they're not REALLY brother and sister
","After the great success of ""The Brady Bunch Movie"" in 1995 the producers didn't waste time in offering a sequel the very next year that's even better. Both films poke fun at the Brady's wholesome and unified spirit, but also highlight their early-70's outlandishness by having the stories take place in the mid-90s. Yet these movies are never meanspirited; there's a welcome warmheartedness.",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 1999,Wizard-8,," Better than the first
","This is one of those rare sequels that's better than the first. The reason it works is because more time is spent with the Brady family, and the humor is more savage to the family (though wisely, the Bradys still remain quite likable.) The cast is great.",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2007,dpags01,10," Must see for Brady fans
","Another of the rare breed of sequels-better-than-the-original movies, A Very Brady Sequel continues with the idea of the 70's Brady's being stuck in the present (in this case, the mid-90's) from the first film. While the original movie was very funny (grunge music nonwithstanding), the total lack of a plot was a pretty obvious hole.",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2006,Isaac5855,7," A Pretty Good Sequel to a classic spoof...
","A VERY BRADY SEQUEL was the 1996 sequel to THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE which tries to touch upon all the episodes of the classic TV series that the first movie didn't. The paper-thin premise of this sequel centers on the appearance of a shady con-man (Tim Matheson) who arrives on the Bradys' doorstep claiming to be Carol's long-lost first husband, who, according to this film's opening scene, was lost at sea. The con-man is really there to get his hands on a statue that has sat in the background of every episode of the TV show and we now learn that it is part of a set and worth a lot of money. But the funniest part of this movie for me is a subplot in which after Roy's arrival, Greg (Christopher Daniel Barnes) and Marcia (Christine Taylor) learn they may not be brother and sister and start lusting after each other. This is, of course, a knowing nod to all those who have read Barry Williams' book GROWING UP BRADY where he confesses to having been madly in love with Maureen McCormick and had trouble looking at her in a sisterly way when they were working. This movie addresses this in a hysterical scene where Greg and Marcia are sharing the room in the attic and start undressing in silhouette. This scene is cleverly shot and perfectly performed by Barnes and Taylor. The rest of the cast has settled comfortably into their roles for this sequel, especially Gary Cole, who is just spooky as Robert Reed as Mike Brady and Jennifer Elise Cox, who steals every scene she is in as Jan. The fun peters out before a truly lame finale, but for true fans, there is fun to be had here.",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2004,PowerPadMan,10," A Huge Surprise
","Wow. I didn't think I would like this movie at all, since the first was very lackluster. I was wrong. This is MUCH funnier than the first film, and is a fresh change. A man named Trevor (Played by Tim Matheson) claims to be Carol's (Shelly Long) long lost husband. But, Trevor's partner was Carol's husband, who had died, and Trevor is trying to get a treasure he left her. Mike (Gary Cole) and the kids must help stop this from happening.",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 1999,Doc_Who,10," As good as the first movie!!!
","This sequel of the Brady Bunch continues their lives in the 90's. They meet a man who claims to be carol's long lost husband. In reality he is a con man running a scam on the brady's. Eventually the family must go to Hawaii to solve their family problems. There is a couple of subplots involving the older siblings falling in love with each other(yuck!!), jan trying to find her boyfrined etc..Almost of the brady children have some problems to solve!!In Hawaii, John Hillerman (Magnum P.I) has small part in this sequel as good the first!!Also look for Rosie O' Donnell and Zsa Zsa Garbor as themselfes as a charity auction!!One of the cast of a Law and Order aslo plays a cop in this cool summer comedy sequel!!!",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2007,Sylviastel,7," Groovy and Out of Sight!
","Okay, I'm glad that they made a sequel to the original film. In this film, Carol's first husband, Roy Martin, supposedly returns to reunite with his beautiful wife and three blonde daughters. Unfortunately, he's not who or what he appears to be. He seems trapped in Brady's world where cable television is far too out there for them and where dysfunctional seems to be the norm. Greg and Marcia get new digs in the attic with creepy sexual tension between them while Jan fakes a new boyfriend. I love the coffee house scene where Greg and Marcia are double dating and where Jan and her fake boyfriend show up. Well, the fake first husband is only after Carol to get a horse that could pay him 20 million dollars to Hawaii to the anxious buyer. Yes, the plane ride to Hawaii is one to remember. There's singing and dancing and those Bradys are at it again. It's just a fun film to watch over and over. Nothing serious!",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2012,StevePulaski,7," Guilty enjoyment
","After The Brady Bunch Movie was a surprisingly success in 1995, just a year later, A Very Brady Sequel was made, continuing the line of Brady Bunch movies that were paying homage to the original series, but also lampooning them by parodying their cheeriness and their persistent nice-ness.",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2003,shrek2004,," Great fun!
","This movie is so  funny! It's a great spoof of of the Brady shows that were on TV in the '70s and '80s. The first movie is probably better than this, but the second is just as good, maybe a little funnier. The innuendo is great! And the ending is so clever, an award should be given to whoever thought of it!",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2001,Scootman78,10," If you thought the show was weird and cheesy, you'll love the movie
","There may be some who might think that this movie is nasty in how it approaches Greg and Marcia's relationship.  Yes, they are step-brother and step-sister, although that's as far as they're related.  They are not blood related, so technically there can't really be anything sick about it. The whole idea about them having ""almost intimate"" moments in the movie is because it was an obvious way for the producer(s) to poke fun at the show. On the show, Greg and Marcia got along a little ""too well"" for step-children.  If you noticed this in the show, as well as all the other quirks with the Brady clan (not excluding Alice), then you should watch this movie.  I found it hilarious mainly because I thought the show was incredibly cheesy.  This movie also closes some of the chapters that were left open with the show.  For instance...whatever happened to that dog the Brady's had?  And there's a prequel to this movie too.  It's also a good movie.  You just got to have a good sense of humor to enjoy the jokes and low-brow fun.",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2005,Siel_O,9," I loved it!!
","it was very funny and light. what i found really unique and i really loved was that it had so many undertones containing really messed up stuff like sex, violence, drugs, the corrupt society of our time, homosexuality, incest and more. i LOVED that Marcia and Greg were attracted to each other - it was very cool! (i'm only sad we didn't get more information about what really ended between them *hopes they got married as well* XD XD XD) also the conflicts Carol had regarding the return of her ""real"" husband. i loved the combination of CRAZY humor with a touch of serious issues. the jokes were very funny and i loved the gags they entered which involved the original show and other shows from that time (Gilligan's Island, I Dream of Jeannie and more(?)). most importantly the actors were beautiful to look at (*loves Greg*). XD",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 1999,jaws!,," an improvement over the first one
","the first one was almost never funny. but this one has a lot of funnier gags. i watched the re-runs of the tv series a few times,and i liked them,but never kept watching them. the second one is pretty much a lot funnier than the first one. it had the laughs,just needed to be a little more entertaining. i give a very brady sequel **1/2 out of ****",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 1999,Tito-8,9," A very funny sequel
","Thanks largely to a considerably better plot, this sequel manages to outshine the 1995 movie.  The same terrific cast is back, but this time, they don't just imitate the actors from the original series.  Here, the jokes are often a little more suggestive, and it works well as a contrast to the innocence that dominated the television show.  Like the first, this is nothing but fluff, but it's some very entertaining fluff, and this is a must-see for Brady fans everywhere.",/review/rw0398882/?ref_=tt_urv
