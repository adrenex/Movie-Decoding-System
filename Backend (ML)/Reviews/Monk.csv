29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," All-Time Great Show!
","Monk is a classic. Tony Shalhoub is incredible as a former detective with obsessive compulsive disorder. It's such an original show that will keep you laughing and entertained throughout its entire run. I didn't start watching it until it was almost off the air but heard such good things about it that I finally thought I'd gave it a chance. So glad I did because it quickly became one of my favorite comedy/detective shows I've ever seen! It is the perfect blend of comedy and mystery. Even though Tony Shalhoub won a ton of awards for his work as Monk, including numerous Emmy & Golden Globe awards, he still is such an underrated actor who was just perfect in this as Monk! I miss this great show so much and still try to watch it whenever I see it's on.",/review/rw7697184/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2022,atlasmb,10," A Television Classic
","Many sleuths of literature, film or television have idiosyncrasies or handicaps to overcome. It's a common theme that many of them use their personal foibles as an occupational aid. Adrian Monk (Tony Shaloub) is one such character. As a P. I. he has a reputation as a wunderkind, super sleuth, savant, and deductive virtuoso. Despite his OCD, his panoply of phobias, and a lingering emotional wound from the loss of his wife, Trudy, Monk is called in when the police can't solve a murder. He uses his debilitating attention to details to view a crime scene or piece together clues as no one else can. And it is all done in humor.",/review/rw7697184/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ah Mr. Monk, how I miss this show, there's nothing quite like it. It caught my interest right from the beginning even though I was slightly annoyed by Monk. Sharona made up for it though, she was pretty and fun and I loved the friendly chemistry between them. I remember thinking, if she leaves the show I will stop watching it. Then came Natalie and guess what, love at first appearance! Not only is she incredibly cute and adorable, the character she played was perfect and the relationship with Monk even better! Whoever did that is a genius.",/review/rw7697184/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2022,dbarr123,10," Fantastic!!!!
",I almost never give shows 10 stars. Every single episode in Monk is uniquely entertaining to watch. I am never dissatisfied with any of the cast. Each episode has it's own crime so you get to see one solved every time as you learn about how the characters relate to one another. It's so much fun to watch Monk!,/review/rw7697184/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2006,ccthemovieman-1,," Monk Mania Is Upon Us
","Here's a cable television that, by word of mouth, is really gaining in popularity..... and it's easy to see why. It scores a bullseye by combining interesting crime stories with humor. When you have that combination and it works, you have a winner.",/review/rw7697184/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2005,jwhale9382,," Mystery/Comedy...who knew?
","I used to watch Murder She Wrote with my parents, but I never really got into the stories. Mysteries just weren't my thing back then. Then, a few weeks ago, my parents introduced me to this show on USA network about a neurotic detective. So I watched it and after one episode I had a new favorite show.",/review/rw7697184/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2022,hannahroseimagery,9," Thank You, Mr. Monk <3
","I love this show. My husband and I watched and enjoyed all 8 seasons. We were struggling to find something we both enjoyed, and Monk had the perfect balance between sweetness and dark humor.",/review/rw7697184/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2022,JoeKulik,10," Being disabled doesn't need to mean giving up on Life !!!
","For me, Adrien Monk is a VERY Brave Man who was determined to make a life for himself in spite of his apparently permanent disability. Not ALL Disabled People are like Monk. Whether disabled from birth, or at a later time, there are far too many disabled people ""who just roll over and play dead"". They give up on Life and are content with cashing a monthly disability check which enables them to sit in front of a TV set all day. The story of Adrien Monk is a direct antithesis of such an empty and meaningless life. NO One would have blamed Monk if he had NEVER returned to work from disability. NO One !!! EVERYONE in the story line accepts that the death of his wife injured him mentally beyond repair. Yet Monk was that rare individual who would not let Life defeat him. He came back as a very quirky detective who many ridiculed. But this weird little man projects courage in every episode by simply doing his job. The World needs MORE Adrien Monk's, people who are willing to Fight the Good Fight, even after the World serves you a lethal blow.",/review/rw7697184/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2009,benjamitesandwich,10," It's time to say goodbye

18 April 2022,Cilica,8," Going back again to watch all 8 series again
","I thought I'd seem most of the Monk series. Back when it aired on TV we had to watch when scheduled. Watching this past couple weeks the full 8 series, I found I had missed many. I love the comedy to make light of a challenging mental health issue by illuminating that regardless of therapy, and personal 'I want to get change' sometimes it isn't our will that can change our brain's direction. Wonderfully done.",/review/rw7697184/?ref_=tt_urv

26 January 2022,contact-01770,10," I never understood what this show is about-until now
","Due to the lack of good TV shows coming out (or so it seems) I started to rewatch older shows...like all of them. King of queens, Seinfeld you name it. One show I could never get my head around was Monk, until now. Once I started with episode 1, it just felt right. It's easy, funny and if not careful you will start to reminisce and go back to times when SFO was on your bucket list to either visit or live. I don't know what it means to operate under those medical conditions but Tony plays it brilliantly and it's fun to watch. What makes it unique (I think) is putting his conditioning to solve crime in a fun and easy but also heart warming way. Almost every episode has one laugh out loud scene like him being surrounded by sniffing and sneezing kids...enough said. You will enjoy it and feel good.",/review/rw7697184/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,definedrdcg,10," The funniest Detective show ever!
","Monk was always hilarious, touching and endearing. Whether it was his obsessive compulsiveness or his sadness about his murdered wife this show made you feel for this character! Not to mention all the supporting characters were great members of the show. This is a rare show that got better the last few seasons! The show finale was the best I've ever witnessed! Monk is missed til this day!",/review/rw7697184/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," I really like this show!
","Monk is a very entertaining detective series, that is excellent if you want some chuckles for 45 minutes. Tony Shalhoub is fantastic in the lead, giving the character a sense of charm and humour. Monk suffers from OCD. However, because of this, Monk's actions are priceless, as he is obsessed with everything. There was even one episode, when he was at a school, and he wrote his name very neatly on the blackboard, and rubbed it off again, after he was unsatisfied with how it looked. Bitty Schram is lovely as Sharona, and Traylor Howard was a very worthy replacement in the later series as Natalie. Ted Levine is amusing as Stottlemeyer,(I loved the episode with the chimpanzee and Levine jumping up and down in the interview room) there was one episode, when he was exasperated when Monk was convinced that a man who is ""conveniently"" in a coma sent bombs to two people, Levine's reactions were priceless. Jason Gray-Stanford has his moments as Lieutenant Randall Disher. There have also been some great guest stars, one of my many favourites was Tim Curry as Dale ""the Whale"" Biederbeck in the episode Mr Monk Goes To Jail, as well as John Tuturro as Monk's estranged brother Ambrose. I am not hugely keen on Randy Newman, so I don't know what to think of the title song. Other than that, I really like Monk. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",/review/rw7697184/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2020,UniqueParticle,10," The most accurate representation of OCD and comforting
",Tony Shaloub is legendary! I've seen all of Monk twice this will be the 3rd time maybe 4th I love it all so much! The quirkiness is magnificent especially to me since I have ASD. Music in it is perfection so is the acting throughout. All the crime cases consistently stay interesting at least for the bulk of it. I'm glad I got back into this show and would definitely recommend it.,/review/rw7697184/?ref_=tt_urv

5 June 2004,ncm215,," Absolutely AMAZING
","Tony Shalhoub is a genius in inhabiting the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of this character. I myself am an obsessive-compulsive, and he gets the experience of suffering from this disease exactly. I watch this show regularly. It's therapeutic (partly because I get all the OCD jokes and get to laugh at myself) - and HILARIOUS, even if you don't know anything about OCD! Shalhoub completely deserves the Best Actor Emmy and SAG Awards he's won for this role. Shalhoub's sweet, anxious genius, Adrian Monk, is dead-on. And Bitty Schram as his nurse is also hilarious and so marvelous! I highly recommend you watch this show!",/review/rw7697184/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2004,Spooky2001,," A Fun, Funny, and Entertaining Show
",I don't have cable but I was happy when the first season of Monk came on DVD.  I always wanted to see that show because I heard good things about it. I finally got to see the show.  I loved it.  It was funny and entertaining. There was never a dull moment in any of the episodes.  It held my interest. I have heard bad things about the second season but I will still watch it. For anybody who said murder isn't funny(like the last reviewer) it is not the murder that makes the show funny but Monk himself and the other characters help too.  I can't wait to see what the writers will think of next.  If you like detective mysteries and you like comedy then this show is for you.  I can't wait for the second season to come out on dvd.,/review/rw7697184/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2021,hassanm-30449,10," Brilliant feel-good detective show
","After revisiting Monk after 10 years, safe to say it is a family favourite. I love how Monk is able to pick up on seemingly trivial details to solve murder mysteries. Although there is an overarching storyline of Monk solving his wife's murder, each episode can be watched as a standalone which means you can pick and choose your favourite episodes whenever you want without having to recall previous episodes. Also, they perfectly casted Monk's assistants - I love the relationship between Monk with Sharona and Natalie - they don't judge him but support him and believe him when others may doubt him.",/review/rw7697184/?ref_=tt_urv
