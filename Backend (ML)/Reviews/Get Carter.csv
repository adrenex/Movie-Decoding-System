1 November 2020,classicsoncall,7," ""Is there any house big enough to hold him?""
","I hadn't seen any reviews for this film before watching it so the CGI threw me off for a minute. I mean it's really well done, but you have to acclimatize yourself to the fact that Buck and every other animal in the picture was computer generated. I haven't read the Jack London novel upon which the story is based, but as so often happens after I see a movie of similar circumstance, I make it a point to do so in the near future. (Which I'm currently doing with 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo').",/review/rw5991341/?ref_=tt_urv

3 May 2020,eddie_baggins,6," Far better than the trailers made it look
","For a $135 million dollar costing financial flop that stars a much ridiculed CGI dog as its main protagonist, The Call of the Wild is a surprisingly watchable family affair that is nowhere near as bad as its terrible trailers or marketing campaign made it look to be.",/review/rw5991341/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,AlsExGal,6," Harrison Ford saves this film
","This film was really meant to be a post Christmas family film, and it probably succeeds at that. What really bothered me is that the dogs are completely CGI. I can understand it for the scenes where the animals would be in peril, but for the close intimate scenes between man and dog, it really hurts the film to not have a real dog in the part of Buck. Also, this tale is of a kinder gentler Buck, not the tale in the Jack London novel.",/review/rw5991341/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2020,Karynsiegmann,7," Cheesy but good
","As it's dads 92nd birthday we went to see a movie I knew he'd love, Call of the Wild. Based on the classic novel by Jack London the movie tells the story of Buck the dog and his adventures as a comfortable city dog to a working dog in The Yukon, this is squarely aimed at the family market, playing down the cruel treatment of sled dogs and the harsh life. The CGI animals were good but didn't take me out of myself. It's schmalzy and cheesy but good fun and I shed a few tears. 3.5 stars
George: A very dramatic movie with fantastic scenery of The Yukon! The animal animation was fantastic and Harrison Ford played a good role as the curmudgeonly loner. I remember reading Jack London's novels and I enjoyed this adaptation very much. 4 stars

19 February 2020,masonsaul,7," Heartwarming adventure
","The Call of the Wild is a familiar but heartwarming adventure that's surprisingly funny and emotional. The CG dog is great and conveys lots of emotions and the CG in general is also great, though it has moments where it dips in quality. Harrison Ford is amazing and Omar Sy gives a really good supporting performance. Chris Sanders' direction is great and there are some thrilling set pieces. It's well filmed, well paced and the music by John Powell is fantastic.",/review/rw5991341/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2020,MR-ODIN,," Great movie for the family
","I am not sure how the story in the book goes, but the movie was great! It had adventure, beautiful scenery, laughter, and sadness. The entire film flowed well, it had intensity and kept your thoughts wanting to discover what happened next.",/review/rw5991341/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2020,TxMike,," Jack London's 1890s Yukon novel brought to life.
","There have been several movies ""Call of the Wild"" but this is the first time one has told the entire story in Jack London's book. The real main character is the big dog, Buck, and his transformation from house pet to sled dog to alpha male of his own hybrid Timberwolf pack.",/review/rw5991341/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2020,robfollower,8," The Call of the Wild : Review
","The Call of The Wild is a solid, incredibly well made movie. Buck is an extremely likable protagonist who goes on a compelling journey of self discovery. Despite being a dog and not having a word of dialogue, Buck is an incredibly interesting, three dimensional character with a well developed arc. The CGI used to bring him to life is amazing. While it doesn't always look natural, Buck's CGI model is so expressive and can cause the viewer to experience a variety of different emotions, despite not even being there.",/review/rw5991341/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Call of The Wild is a solid, incredibly well made movie. Buck is an extremely likeable protagonist who goes on a compelling journey of self discovery. Despite being a dog and not having a word of dialogue, Buck is an incredibly interesting, three dimensional character with a well developed arc. The CGI used to bring him to life is amazing. While it doesn't always look natural, Buck's CGI model is so expressive and can cause the viewer to experience a variety of different emotions, despite not even being there. Harrison Ford also does well as the elderly, depressed John Thornton, carrying a great deal of tragedy and mystery about his past throughout the movie. The movie also features stunning cinematography, with several beautiful shots and camera angles. It's a true joy to look at. However, there are a few problems with the movie. For starters, John Thornton narrates a lot throughout the movie, despite not being present for, and therefore having no way of knowing about, the events that he's describing. Another issue is Dan Stevens' character; Hal. Hal is an entirely unnecessary, one dimensional antagonist, who just doesn't work with the story this movie is trying to tell. His presence also completely derails John Thornton's resolution. However, despite these problems, I still recommend The Call Of The Wild. It's a fantastic movie, with an incredible protagonist and stunningly beautiful visuals that you shouldn't miss.",/review/rw5991341/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2021,deadbull-95171,1," Jack London would turn in his grave
","London is one of my favorite authors. Eloquent, brutal, who always has something to say. A great story teller who was in the Klondike, didn't get gold, except by writing about those who made the effort, the vast majority of them failing or dying.",/review/rw5991341/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2020,dylanhorne-76909,6," I was expecting the wrong thing
","This is a great family movie. It has all the aspects of what makes kids smile. However, this is not the adaption of Jack London's book that I was looking for. In my opinion, in searching for that feel good vibe, it lost the character that defined the original story. Everything was made PG and the raw unforgiving reality of the book was lost in translation. Additionally, the CGI was good, but over used to the nth degree. Its worth a watch, just keep in mind that this movie is a rather loose adaptation.",/review/rw5991341/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2020,pegadodacruz,6," When a dog barks instead of talking...it is a dog!
","Not sure what the critics saw that was so bad with the CGI on buck the dog... if anything the ability of having animal like emotions displayed felt much better than looking at lions trying to speak...I thought the movie was well put together. Harrison Ford does a very simple yet good performance, the narrative is simple and easy to figure out for adults but still very relate-able and, the whole journey of the protagonists is really good a true adventure of self-discovery... What really told me that the movie nailed it, was when in the end I asked my 9 year old, what was it all about... and she goes it's about being you, not letting others tell you what you can or cannot do... and my 12 years old, goes like it's about finding your place in the world...take the kids, have them be quite and listen...they might just get some life lessons out of it.",/review/rw5991341/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2021,v-56289,4," expected more...
","I am not really fan of this animation style... Also the narrator wasn't particularly good and the authors manipulated the story too much... The main plot remains, but it's a different story.. Basically, they took out the roughness and replaced by love, thrill, inclusion and personification of animal behaviour... (not that something is wrong about these values... maybe apart the latest one.. but it just makes the message of the movie totally different).",/review/rw5991341/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2020,DinosaurAct86,6," The Call of the Wild-lite
","While this film version is indeed a visually-pleasing family adventure epic, it is better suited for those who are not looking for any of Jack London's naturalistic tone. It is what I would deem The Call of the Wild-lite, meaning it does provide the gist of the original story without all of the violence and death.",/review/rw5991341/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2020,archanademonia,8," Good family film
","I went into this not knowing anything about the movie except a friend of mine said ""once you know you know"" (referring to our favorite movie as kids - Balto). I did not know it was based on a book, I did not know it was going to be CGI. At first I was a bit taken aback by the CGI, but I quickly learned to love Buck, and I feel like the team did a great job with the animals in this movie. I thought they looked good and were pretty naturally animated. The story seems very mild, and I guess it has to be for a family friendly movie. After reading some comments I guess the book tells a bit of a different story so I'll be heading over to read that now! But all in all, this was a decent watch - perhaps for a movie night with kids, or if you just want something very chill.",/review/rw5991341/?ref_=tt_urv

","There is a gold rush in the Yukon and sled dogs are needed. Buck is a big dog. He has the run of his town due to his influential owner, the Judge. He is dognapped and shipped up to Alaska where he is sold to kind mail carrier Perrault (Omar Sy). He is also befriended by drunken recluse John Thornton (Harrison Ford). When the mail route gets canceled, he is sold to vicious reckless guide Hal (Dan Stevens). More and more, he hears the Call of the Wild.",/review/rw5991341/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2020,iboso64,5," Maybe it should have been called ""Call of the Mild"" or ""That Darn Buck!""
","Very, very loosely based on one of the great adventures of literature, this movie frequently plays more like a 1970s Disney film. While I think it's awesome, using a CGI dog to put him and the others through the harsh action scenes, did they have to make him look so cartoonish in the more personal scenes? A dog's reactions should be that of a dog, not a human. About half of the names in the cast are in blink and you'll miss it cameos, and the film only really comes to life when the focus narrows down to Ford and Buck, getting in touch with nature. It's only the last half hour or so, with them, that keeps me from giving this an even lower score.",/review/rw5991341/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2020,theojhyman,7," Sweet, innocent, old school movie
","I was actually very impressed with the CGI dog, who became more and more real as the film went on, probably because of how emotionally involved you become with his character.
Harrison Ford is great (though in the film for probably 50% of the time).
Anyway, it's all about the story of Buck the dog and it's a sweet, lovely, story with an old school feel. The CGI expressions on Buck's face are just slightly hyper-real, as in a bit overly emotive compared to a dog in reality, but it works, and if you like dogs, then you'll love Buck and his adventures in this movie. He gets treated quite harshly and violently at times, but that makes his story all the more emotional at the end.
Great for kids aged 7 and up and great for parents who like an old school movie or fans of Harrison Ford too!",/review/rw5991341/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2020,Calicodreamin,6," Decent
","The cinematography throughout this movie was quite beautiful, with the landscapes and the cgi on the animals. The characters were well acted and well scripted, but they had no depth. I didn't find myself very emotionally invested in the story. It was a decent movie in all aspects, it just wasn't too much of anything which left it a bit underwhelming.",/review/rw5991341/?ref_=tt_urv

22 February 2020,paulbarboot,8," A very loose interpretation of the novel
","And thank goodness for that. The novel is beautifully written and also heartbreaking. The movie pulls at the heart strings enough to be effective without ripping said heart apart.
I watched this in an AVX/Dbox theatre. Lots of kids and laughs in the theatre. Go and see it.",/review/rw5991341/?ref_=tt_urv
