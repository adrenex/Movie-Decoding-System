","This movie feels like it was wrote by a teenager. It is so melodramatic and self pitying, it is a disaster.",/review/rw5887803/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2020,Sport_Ho,1," Seems almost intentional
","To make characters this unlikable. Not sure if the casting, the writing, the editing, the directing or a combination of them all made this movie so bad. The lead is supposed to have a high IQ? Not believable. This movie missed its mark on so many levels. It really could have been an inspirational, funny and entertaining movie however it just emphasizes how sh!tty entitled teens can be. Oh and the music? So annoying!",/review/rw5887803/?ref_=tt_urv

13 July 2020,carobearo,2," Screw college, just become an influencer
","Great advice for rich kids of LA. Who needs to actually work for what you get? Just go viral one time, turn down scholarships, and instead jaunt around Europe with your crush.",/review/rw5887803/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2020,nicole_paradis04,1," Terrible. Hard to like the main character
","I wanted to like this movie, I did. The main character Just so hard to like... he is obnoxious and entitled like your typical gen z. He doesn't apologize or take responsibility for messing up, values social media fame over getting an education. Watch something else!",/review/rw5887803/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2020,SkepticalSy,4," As I was watching ...
","As I was watching this movie I thought to myself ""this really is a bad movie"", the acting and the direction isn't the greatest.",/review/rw5887803/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2020,odolcha,2," Bul..it list
","Brilliant story about a guy, who found everything ready in life, got bored and blew everything just to have fun...
Let's just change the characters. Instead of rich white guy with wealthy parents, put a hardworking kid from the poor family.. Will he behave the same way? Easy to go wild when you drive fathers' Mercedes and live in the huge house with the pool. Screw it! Let's go crazy, not care about people, environment and other things, let's burn books, schools and other thing.
Millions of kids nowadays do not have even access to schools and sharing books as treasures. So I do not really understand the message of this movie, especially during this crisis we are going through now.",/review/rw5887803/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2021,daisyisabaker,2," Filled with cringe
","Completely missed the mark with trying to be ""relatable and edgy"" with the teenagers of this generation.",/review/rw5887803/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2020,MattFish47,1," This entire movie wreaks of privilege
","What an interesting time to release this movie when half of the country is living paycheck to paycheck and 40 million are unemployed. I honestly don't see how anyone without a trust fund could enjoy this? O you burned your school down, told off multiple Ivy League schools and yet you still have enough money to buy a condo in a European beach city? Wow so relatable",/review/rw5887803/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2020,ainna-61891,1," I made an IMDB account just to rate this movie.
","This movie is so terrible that I made an IMDB account for the sole purpose of rating it one star. There are no lessons to be learned from this movie, besides the lesson that movies like this shouldn't be funded, created, celebrated, or shared. If you are above the age of 14, this movie is a waste of your time and a disgrace to our society. If you are between the ages of 10-14, this movie will turn your brain into a can of worms.",/review/rw5887803/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2020,abhi-bhatt-72,2," A bad half an hr
","Another movie that I couldn't finish. The characterization wasn't good, and lacked cohesion. A bunch of aimless high schooler doing their thing. It was uninteresting.",/review/rw5887803/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2020,ferrojas,1," Everything that's wrong with teens these days...
","Summary: a spoiled and entitled brat, with everything and everyone on his side, who has never encountered adversity of any kind on his life, suddenly decides to throw everything away because Harvard, Yale etc are not good enough for him. He gets acussed of blowing his school up and not even gets a slap on the wrist. He changes a good college education for a couple of Instagram followers. The end.",/review/rw5887803/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2020,phoebscheetos,2," boo hoo, i got into harvard
","Very anti-climatic and really has no point aside from, ""haha, school sucks, why not just quit? it's not like you can't afford it :)""",/review/rw5887803/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2020,Culwenimos,1," Shockingly abysmal movie
","A young, attractive teenager who is smart, lives in great house with a swimming, has rich parents who sole goal is see him success, has also quite attractive and cool friends and a potential girlfriend. I mean that's really relatable to the average teenager right? Nope. And we're meant to gun for him as his popularity on social media explodes? No thanks. While I did enjoy gawking at the youth that is Brett Blackmore (played by Eli Brown), I can't say there's much substance to this movie. It's never going to happen. Built on a dream. If anyone can relate to this, then lucky you but it leaves a bitter taste of why our lives sucks. I also don't approve the token black friend who is ALSO gay. I mean, is that just so you can tick some boxes. That story branch is lame. It adds little to an already shockingly abysmal movie.",/review/rw5887803/?ref_=tt_urv

","Imagine that your ultra wealthy parents can provide anything and like a BRAT you rebel. You blow up a school with NO REPERCUSSIONS cause your parents pay off the school. In a fit, you steal their Mercedes and decide to go to the desert to have a pity party. Your video allows you to become an influencer and then you can chase your girl around the world and then travel the world.",/review/rw5887803/?ref_=tt_urv

19 August 2020,delzog,2," Pretentious piece of garbage
","This show is so stupid and will p'u'ss most people off. Its tantamount to the guy who is born with everything, has everything, gets everything and then moans and cries over what? NOTHING!",/review/rw5887803/?ref_=tt_urv

5 August 2020,sammybeno,1," Waste of time
","An unbelievably unrealistic try too hard comedy with interjections of PC culture that are distracting to the narrative of the story. Mix that with horrible acting, and a story that has no clear path creates a teen movie disaster. Watch literally anything instead.",/review/rw5887803/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2020,stevenpicozzi,1," Garbage
",I mean I usually am able to sit down and enjoy just about any movie I watch. This is one of the few I've ever felt so compelled to register to IMDB for just to let everyone know how much of a piece of trash this was.,/review/rw5887803/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2020,bjpwtpcjr,1," Horribly Boring Movie
",The main character is a unlikable entitled d bag who is constantly whining. The writing is horrible. The parents are idiots because parents are dumb. The love interest is a boring and stupid girl that wants to become a model who is prostituting herself out. Bottom line is Netflix needs to start producing some quality content or I'm dropping it.,/review/rw5887803/?ref_=tt_urv
