24 September 2018,Aaron1375,5," I'll take the cartoon version thank you
","Disney has gotten on a kick of making live action versions of their classic cartoons, and why not? People are flocking to these things, so much so that this one made over 500 million in the US alone. Why come up with something original, when you can just redo the same thing and the people act like it is the best thing since sliced bread. Saves writers the trouble of being creative as you already have the basic structure of the story in place, just tweak it a bit and in this one they did not even bother to tweak it very much at all. Same movie essentially, but with a few added things here and there and a look that to me looks cheap. The beast looks good and some of the effects are alright, but it has a look of a movie that should have come on ABC as a special rather than a 150 plus budgeted movie meant for the big screen.",/review/rw3684905/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2017,claudio_carvalho,7," Magnificent Computer Graphic Imagery and Cinematography
","""Beauty and the Beast"" retells the Disney's version of the French fairy-tale written by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve and published in 1740. The story is very similar to the magnificent 1991 animation and highly attractive. However this 2017 version is uneven, with the most boring songs that anyone could imagine and reasonable acting despite the great names in the cast. But the top-notch Computer Graphic Imagery (CGI) and the cinematography are worthwhile watching. Keep awake along the musical scenes and you may like and be surprised by this version. My vote is seven.",/review/rw3684905/?ref_=tt_urv

1 April 2017,moonspinner55,3," Expensive but not expansive...everything money can buy or manufacture except charm and spirit
","Disney trying to top themselves. This live-action rendering of the studio's 1991 animated version of the oft-told fairy tale is Disney's way of giving family-friendly audiences a 'treat' while raking in big money the easy way: by delivery a presold product, one with name and song value--and built-in approval ratings. At a debutante ball in 18th century France, an old hag casts a spell on the partygoers after she is rebuffed (seems she's an enchantress in disguise, though we have no idea why); the selfish prince of the manor is then turned into a beastly creature, while his attendants are turned into (talking) objects. Her spell will be broken once the prince learns about true love, though this must happen before the last pedal on the enchantress's rose falls... Ideally, this material is timeless and should entertain those who do not know the story and approach it with a fresh perspective. However, while Disney's previous version broke new ground for animated musicals, this dark, lead-footed endeavor never lifts off, remaining flatly earthbound despite the familiar songs and characters. When trying for a little humor, scenarists Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos cannot come up with anything other than dry sarcasm, which doesn't wear well on their princess Belle, played by a miscast Emma Watson. Whether feigning indignation or attempting to register awe, Watson approaches her part with a firm jaw and a righteous tone, as if this were a feminist mock-up; when she asks the Beast if he's joking when he offers his castle to her, she sounds like the captain of a cheerleading squad. The art direction and design of this preconceived blockbuster is fussy and forgettable--no one will come out of this movie saying that it transported them to another time and place--while the unobtrusive supporting cast plays it safe, perhaps so as not to be in competition with their animated counterparts. Somewhere, French filmmaker Jean Cocteau (who helmed the 1946 version, ""La Belle et la BÃªte"") is smiling, for trendy blockbusters come and go but art remains truly timeless. *1/2 from ****",/review/rw3684905/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2017,mike48128,10," Walt would have loved it. Rated 11 stars and a box of tissues!
","An almost perfect adaptation with many subtle changes that many people will probably miss. What I dislike is the obvious ""gayness"" of LeFou. A magnificent marriage of live action, animation, and CGI. ""Agathe"" is the ""enchantress"" who changes the Prince into the Beast, and yet this is never quite obvious to the townspeople. Additional songs and reworked lyrics, plus a more complete ""background story"" about Belle's and the Prince's parents. Only one or two scary spots and a rather pleasing interpretation of the Beast in ""human"" form. Belle's father is portrayed as a very clever man and not as an absent-minded buffoon. Gaston shoots The Beast several times and it's ""almost bloodless"" Hollywood violence. In 1991, he stabbed the Beast to death. Gaston dies as he traditionally should; never by the hand of the Disney hero or heroine. When a film or stage-play is ""reborn"" it's impossible to please everyone, but this one tries very hard to do so. Amazing cinematography, costumes and art direction. An outstanding cast and very well performed. I thought Emma Watson was just fine. I want that White Stallion with his built-in ""GPS""! I miss the (extra) song ""Human Again"" and it should have been there! Enjoyable and entertaining ending titles. A great marketing idea would be the packaging of the 1991 animation and this 2017 version as a double Blu-Ray? For almost everyone except extremely small children. Curiously reviewed, as people either totally loved it or hated it!",/review/rw3684905/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2017,planktonrules,9," A visual masterpiece that you MUST see....
","I have to admit it...I was dead wrong about ""Beauty and the Beast"". I had absolutely zero desire to see it because I really hate remakes. The only reason I did was because my wife insisted we go. And, when the wife insists...we go! I have now to thank my wife and must admit she was right...the film is terrific. The only reason I don't score this one an A+ is simply because so much of it is a regurgitation of the wonderful 1991 cartoon version by Disney.",/review/rw3684905/?ref_=tt_urv

16 March 2017,LaLaLandSucks,1," An Autotuned Mess
","This adaptation is a disgrace to the original. Watson's voice is auto- tuned to death and the Beast CGI wasn't good. Each time the Beast popped up, he was very off putting. Watson's line deliveries are poor and doesn't do the animated princess justice. She also seems a bit too young for the role. She is a total miscast. Despite the Beast's CGI, at least his performance was very good as both the Beast and Prince compared to Watson. Emma Thompson's rendition of Tale as Old as Time does not beat the animated tea cup, but at least she was not auto tuned to death. There are very few moments of originality as it is a frame by frame copy to the animated film. It's very uninspiring and unnecessary.",/review/rw3684905/?ref_=tt_urv

",As a fan of the original Disney film (Personally I feel it's their masterpiece) I was taken aback to the fact that a new version was in the making. Still excited I had high hopes for the film. Most of was shattered in the first 10 minutes. Campy acting with badly performed singing starts off a long journey holding hands with some of the worst CGI Hollywood have managed to but to screen in ages. ,/review/rw3684905/?ref_=tt_urv

8 June 2017,drrap,8," A classic in its own right
","As an unabashed fan of the 1991 film, I came to this version ready for a fight -- more than one! Who dares tamper with a classic? But bit by bit, and moment by moment, I was enchanted all over again: the human performances ""fleshed out"" the old animated ones; the coggier Cogsworth and more limited Lumiere charmed me afresh with their differences from memory. The new songs, though surprising, fit remarkably well, and I never felt that the score missed a beat. And when all was added up, the sum was far more than any of the new and varied parts: this is a fresh masterpiece, beginning as a riff but ending with something much much more than a ""cover"" -- if Disney can do this as well with its other planned live-action/CGI versions, then count me in. This is a brilliantly-crafted film that honors and yet moves beyond its beloved original.",/review/rw3684905/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2017,suroorzehra,1," Plain
","Where do I start. This adaptation of Disney's 1991 Beauty and the Beast was an utter disappointment. Emma Watson as Belle was extremely unconvincing from the start to the end. She had the same expressions as the actress from Twilight. The animators did a terrible job with the Beast. He looked fake and lifeless. They could have used special makeup to create the beast similar to the Grinch where we get to see Jim Carrey's expressions. The side character animations were poorly executed. Overall I felt the film was rushed as there was lack of compassion and chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of CGI and green screen which could have been replaced by normal acting, because then why make an animated version of an animated film? This is by far the worst remake of an animated classic.",/review/rw3684905/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2017,amandawillett0,10," Reliving a childhood classic film
","My first thought of a real life film Beauty and the Beast I thought disaster was gonna brew. I have been disappointed before with remakes especially to Disney classics. And hearing that Emma Watson was gonna play the lead I was like ""No, no! Please no"" She's Hermione Granger from Harry Potter and nothing more. So it was pretty intense to see the social media talk about it and hear their own opinions. But when the first photo came out for Emma as ""Belle"" I was blown away and my thoughts changed to hopefulness. As time came to see the trailers I braced myself yet again. ""Would they stay true to the Disney classic or totally take it on a opposite roller coaster?"" When it came out I was totally moved and in tears of joy. They did everything as they possibly could to make it real, and true to the Disney version. Little changes happened yes, like one or two songs, but they were all beautifully done and made for great reasons. All casting was beautifully done, music was perfect and it left me feeling like a child again. ",/review/rw3684905/?ref_=tt_urv

","Adapting Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve's original French story about a beauty and her beast is no easy task.
