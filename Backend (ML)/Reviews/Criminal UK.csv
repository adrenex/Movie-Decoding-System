19 October 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8," A claustrophobic and suspenseful mystery-thriller.
","Arguably, the worst aspects of '10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)' are those that tie into its franchise roots, which is understandable considering that this started life as a completely original screenplay before it was contorted to fit into the 'Cloverfield (2008)' ""universe"". These issues are really only limited to a somewhat rushed finale, though, and the final result is still a much finer film than its predecessor. It's an incredibly intriguing and evolving mystery-thriller that's consistently entertaining and suspenseful, as it uses its small core cast of well-realised characters to drive the tension within its (mostly) single, increasingly claustrophobic location to expert effect. It's incredibly compelling mainly because of its intense focus on character, while it's the several subtle twists and turns that keep us on the edge of our seat as our reading of the situation (always seen through the lens of the protagonist) continues to organically change. Ultimately, the piece becomes perhaps one of the most enjoyable entries in its genre. 8/10",/review/rw3432373/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2016,purrlgurrl,8," What are people throwing shade on this movie?
","Pluses: 1. Great cast. Really good chemistry among them. Terrific performances from all. Mary Elizabeth Winstead gets better with every film she makes. 2. Story keeps you guessing until the end. 3. There are references in it to some popular films in the genre (that are likely film maker favorites) from the past 30 years or so. 4. Director shows great promise while still early in his career. 4. Story more important than special effects or pointless action sequences (always a plus for me). 5. Sound effects, usually unappreciated in non-action films, well used to add to the intensity of the drama.",/review/rw3432373/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2016,DVR_Brale,7," Slow building & plot alternating claustrophobic bunker movie with a sloppy ending
",I've always loved movies with strong atmosphere. Three people locked together in an underground shelter is a recipe for making a movie which is going to draw you in a rather small but peculiar world.,/review/rw3432373/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2019,spookyrat1,8," The Right Postcode!
","I'm probably in the minority, but I disliked Cloverfield ... intensely! So many of these found footage films as far as I'm concerned, are just an invitation to watch someone's tarted-up home movie. Their producers/directors should be commended for being excellent marketing strategists in being able to convince punters to part with their hard-earned, to watch some (generally) cheap, tacky B feature. Cloverfield was no exception.",/review/rw3432373/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2016,deloudelouvain,8," One of the better ones this year
","I explicitly avoid watching any trailers or reading any reviews from 10 Cloverfield Lane just because I wanted to be certain to be surprised by the story. I just heard from some people that it was good and that's all I needed to know. And I'm glad I did because during the whole entire movie you wonder what is really happening. You think about all the possible scenarios and still you are never sure what is going on. I like those kind of movies, mysteries, that keep you on edge all the time. The cast did a perfect job with their respective performances. And even though there are almost no other actors then the three main ones, John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr, the movie never gets boring. It's full of twists and that's how I like it. One of the better ones I saw this year.",/review/rw3432373/?ref_=tt_urv

22 July 2016,michaelRokeefe,8," Trapped in a doomsday bunker.
","J.J. Abram's divulges us a thriller this time. Not necessarily manipulative, but we are enticed into this one and it promises us some suspense. After being knocked out in an auto accident, Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) wakes up shackled in a basement. Not just a basement, but the underground bunker of a dour survivalist named Howard (John Goodman). Consumed with paranoia, this man is sure than the world has been depopulated by a nuclear attack. He has prepared for years for this; and as far has he believes, if the damn Russians aren't responsible, aliens are. Michelle soon finds she is not the only one sharing the bunker. Is Howard a cynical captor or the savior, he professes? This movie really has no connection to Abram's CLOVERFIELD (2008). Although it is a bit unnerving with some surprises. Miss Winstead is outstanding and Goodman is very convincing as the cunning survivalist. There are some scenes of dread, doom and violence. A minimal soundtrack features tunes by Frankie Avalon, the Exciters and Tommy James & The Shondells.",/review/rw3432373/?ref_=tt_urv

9 March 2016,NonSequiturL,8," Great claustrophobic story with fine performances... and a twist
","Full disclosure: The year is 2007. A trailer hits cinema screens advertising a mysterious film named ""Cloverfield."" Nobody knows what it's about, except that it's riding on the wave of the found footage genre, and that it seems to depict a giant monster attack on New York. Speculation immediately breaks out all over the internet, but nowhere more fiercely than on the IMDb forums, with many folks being caught up in the genius viral marketing. I myself was one of those people, along with my wife. Yes, we met on IMDb's Cloverfield forum. She moved from the US to Australia a few years after, we got married, and we've lived together happily ever since.",/review/rw3432373/?ref_=tt_urv

13 September 2016,MUFCOK,7," Brilliant movie until the final 15 minutes where it takes a massive nose dive.
","Now, I knew going into this that it wasn't in the same ball park as the 2008 movie Cloverfield. I was aware of the basic plot but I had stayed clear of trailers and reviews before viewing it as I didn't want to ruin my viewing experience. It was painfully obvious that before I watched the movie it was going to have an alien/monster aspect. The fact that is is named Cloverfield and that I saw a movie poster of the house glowing like a spaceship pretty much confirmed to me, before viewing that there was to be some form of sci-fi element outside of the bunker. And when a movie spends most of its energy keeping you guessing to whether the outside world is infected, when its glaringly obvious (off my two previous points alone) that it actually will be, is a whopping plot hole in my personal opinion.",/review/rw3432373/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2017,mhodaee,5," Fantastic, gripping, thoroughly enjoyable, until the final part ruins it...
","I give the 5/10 out of the credit I owe to the original writers of the fascinating psychological horror that takes place inside the bunker. The mystery is compelling: Is Howard telling the truth? Is there any real threat outside? Is Howard a crazy child-abusing maniac? Did he plan all this to own Michelle? etc. I could all go on pretty well had the film ended with the heroine's escape, but then, all of a sudden, what the? REAL ALIENS? Are you kidding me? Just how ""lost"" are you Mr. Abrams?! You turned the fantastic, gripping thriller about a deranged paranoid old man into a totally irrelevant tale of worm aliens taking over the earth? The ending ruins everything. The character of Michelle was well portrayed as a woman running away from problems instead of facing them, finally managing to ""grow up"" and learn to fight her problems. The ending, however, turns her into a completely different person. From a timid girlfriend, Michelle turns into an alien- smacking badass chick straight out of a classic sci-fi alien flick who blows up a giant alien invader with a bottle of liquor and a matchbox and, not frightened in the least, decides to take the fight to the aliens herself. The movie begins and proceeds as a psychological thriller/drama about paranoia, claustrophobia, and insanity and in a split second turns into the worst moments of the Resident Evil franchise. I literally thought I was watching a remake of the ending of The Thing, with the same actress and all. Great job uncle J.J., you did it again. Had I know he was involved in the plot, I would've thought twice before watching this film. You CAN enjoy this film, just turn if off as soon as the hero goes free. keep watching and it'll turn all the fun you had into utter disappointment, frustration, and resentment.",/review/rw3432373/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2016,jtindahouse,9," A brilliant mystery that will keep you guessing until the end
","The first thing I'll say is that I'm not going to spoil a single thing about this film (other than how good it is), because everyone deserves the chance to see this film as I did - without a clue to the answer of the mystery and simply looking for any shred of evidence to guide my opinion. I actually had very little idea what kind of a film I was in for with '10 Cloverfield Lane'. I had seen 'Cloverfield' years back and mildly enjoyed it (according to the rating I gave it on IMDb) but could remember very little of it. I knew what the plot was about and that it was a ""found footage"" film but could remember almost zero specifics. I can tell you though that I won't be forgetting specifics about this sequel for a very long time.",/review/rw3432373/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2016,jigsaw-91,9," Much better than the 2008 ""Cloverfield"" movie, this is about a gripping & intense story and raw tension rather than special effects and crushing things.
","If this is going to be an anthology or if this is going to be followed by that rumored third installment that has been recently spoiled by J.J. Abrahms, I can say that nobody doubts about the secretly marketed ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a great movie on its own. And a movie that if it were spoiled by someone here or at any review would be cruel.",/review/rw3432373/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2016,areatw,5," One almighty anticlimax
","I can't help but feel disappointed with '10 Cloverfield Lane'. Despite being glued to the screen for the vast majority of the film, I almost feel like I've been conned. The ending just didn't come close to what I was expecting. An hour and a half of tension and drama, and for what? One almighty anticlimax that felt like it had been given next to no thought or preparation.",/review/rw3432373/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2016,Matt-Canalcon,9," The secrecy made everything better! (NO SPOILERS)

16 March 2016,CineMuseFilms,4," The ending transforms this film into an incoherent and unforgivable mess.
","Many movie lovers will leave this film with a dilemma swirling in their mind: can a poorly conceived and poorly directed ending be ignored while you hang on to the memory of the brilliant film that almost was? In cinema, the answer is usually no because we remember a film backwards via the way the story ended. The ending is also the key to how we read a film and how we apply genre codes to make sense of cinematic storytelling. This film traverses three totally different but often compatible genres: the psychological thriller, the horror/gore, and the science fantasy, in that order. Note that the last one is not the same as science fiction, a respectable genre that creatively draws on the logic of science. The film 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) starts brilliantly as a thriller, drops a gear or two as horror, and then has an inexcusable brain-snap as mediocre science fantasy.",/review/rw3432373/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2016,jesussanchezfdez,9," Powerful and shocking mystery
",10 Cloverfield Lane gives all the development and the meaningful story that its blood relative installment lacked completely. This is not a spectacle full of screams and special effects. This is a spectacle of tension and suspense of epic proportions. This is a really feel-bad movie at certain points.,/review/rw3432373/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,9," Tension, shocks and lots of tension, a very good watch.
","I've been a little critical of The Cloverfield franchise, particularly the recent offering, The Cloverfield Paradox. However, this film has some serious quality. 10 Cloverfield Lane has intrigue, mystery, surprise, shock, masses of tension and some unexpected sequences. As you watch you start doubting what you're being fed, you wonder if Howard is telling the truth (however crazy it sounds) or if he's a run of the mill psycho. The monster element is used to tremendous effect here, it really works on all levels, especially the shock factor, its presence is woven into the story well, unlike in the Paradox, where it's merely plonked in just because. Excellent performances all round, John Goodman is terrific.",/review/rw3432373/?ref_=tt_urv

13 August 2016,pal05052003,8," A young lady finds herself in an underground house with a mentally unstable 'savior' who claims that the air outside had been contaminated.
","10 Cloverfield Lane is a lean movie that is packed with tension throughout. It does not dwell on over dramatizing the character's situation but manages to keeps a very tense atmosphere throughout the movie. John Goodman's performance as Howard is excellent as he is both menacing but can make the audience sympathize with him. He manages to exert a sense of firm authority that would make anyone fall in line in real life. The cinematography helps too. It creates a claustrophobic atmosphere and gives a sense of helplessness. This makes it easy to also empathize Mary Elizabeth Winstead's situation. Throughout the movie, I could feel the awkwardness, the tension and the menace throughout the atmosphere without the use of gore. This is a very clever psychological horror movie with a great twist at the end. (But given the title has a reference to Cloverfield, it should not be much of a twist, however, it still packs great surprise and tension.) The finale is rather open ended, you can see it as either hopeful or bleak. In short, this is an amazing movie and I wish Hollywood could make more movies like that.",/review/rw3432373/?ref_=tt_urv
