7 August 2018,hazeleng,10," Guilty pleasure
","If I saw the movie now for the first time I know I probably will hate it, but the 11 year old me was so love struck with it. Honestly no movie these days makes me this happy anymore. Also I think this one (the first movie) is so much cinematically pleasing. I enjoy the dark blue rainy vibe & the shaky camera a lot. This movie is my guilty pleasure. 10 for the nostalgia feelings.",/review/rw2029119/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2020,taj-james-holmes,7," Undeniably Atmospheric
","There's an atmosphere to Twilight and that much you simply cannot deny. I can't help but be engrossed by the way that this movie captures the beauty, dreariness and nature of the Pacific Northwest. A memorable score and soundtrack heighten Catherine Hardwicke's broody, yet still enchanting tone. Elliot Davis' cinematography under her direction replicates the indie flair prominent in her other features, this is what separates it apart from the commercially realised sequels that followed. It's a hot and cold, gothic romance with just enough high stakes to enchant you until the very end. If it's raining, you can best believe that I'm slipping into something comfortable and putting Twilight on.",/review/rw2029119/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2008,Smells_Like_Cheese,5," Twilight! Twilight! Oh, my... Twiiiiiiiiliaaaaaaaaaaght!
","That was my interpretation of this weekend that I had to endure working at my movie theater, all these little hormone crazed brace wearing under developed young girls who I think would've just about died with the anticipation of seeing Twilight, I'm not kidding, I personally witnessed a twelve year old say that she wanted to have Robert Pattinson's baby. OK, so how I saw the movie, my sister, ironically my older sister has been just raving about the Twilight series with her friends and told me that I have to read these books, after weeks of bugging me with it, I finally broke down and read them. Actually it's kind of a fun series, it reminded me of the same love that I had for the TV series Buffy the vampire Slayer when I was a young teen. But of course she has to take me to the midnight premiere with 100,000 crazed fans who were knocking each other down and crawling all over each other just to see a movie.",/review/rw2029119/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie deserves an 8 purely for the soundtrack - one of the best movie sound tracks EVER (in my opinion) and beautiful scenery and cinematography. sure, the acting isn't great, nor is the script writing, however this movie is an enjoyable watch and a romance classic",/review/rw2029119/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2008,AnnaShade,," Pretty Good for What They Had to Work With
","I have read the books, and the first thing I noticed was that the story wasn't about a plot line at all. It's about the characters and what's going on with them. Stephenie Meyer focuses on interaction, not on dialog, plot, or setting, which is fine. But it makes for a bad movie.",/review/rw2029119/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2016,Horst_In_Translation,8," Like it or not, the relevance cannot be denied
","""Twilight"" is the first film from a series of five movies based on the literary works of Stephenie Meyer. I do not want to say this took over from Harry Potter as the big movie franchise as Potter was still running at that point, but it had pretty much the same impact on young people back then. ""Back then"" sounds somewhat strange, but the first film is already almost a decade old, so it is an appropriate description. In order to appreciate this film (and the sequels), it is essential what you expect before actually watching them. If you expect a new ""Godfather"", you will of course be disappointed. But if you expect a fantasy film that is not scared of going over-the-top on many occasions during its two hours runtime, then you may have a pretty good watch here like I did.",/review/rw2029119/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2008,pyrocitor,4," Vampiric romance lacks real 'bite'
","After the enormous flurry of attention Stephanie Meyer's literary series attracted (a unique hybrid of Romeo and Juliet style teenage angst and hormonal lust and supernatural horror), a cinematic adaptation seemed not only inevitable but almost expected, providing sultry visuals to the tale of starstruck lovers and proving the definitive date movie for months to come. However, the curse of mainstream literary adaptations proves inescapable, with excitement surrounding the release leading to the film being somewhat unreasonably over-hyped. And while Twilight is hardly a complete failure of a film by any standards, there remains the inescapable sense of its existence being geared to match up to a set standard rather than simply aiming to succeed as a film, making for the overall result being uniformly disappointing, whether for fans of the source material or those unfamiliar with the novels.

14 September 2013,Chrysanthepop,," Teenage Vampire Romance At Its Dullest
","I've been avoiding 'Twilight' for years and was only open to watching it if it was on a had-to basis. And so, as that basis has presented itself, I watched it. After the immense popularity of the novels, particularly among the young crowd, a Hollywood movie seems to be the next step in further cashing in on the popularity these days. Famous examples include the Harry Potter films and 'The Da Vinci Code'. ",/review/rw2029119/?ref_=tt_urv

","To preface this review, I read all four Twilight books in one weekend (last weekend, actually) when I picked the first one up at the airport, and could not put it down. I zipped through the other three and went to the midnight screening on opening day. To say the least, I was captivated by Twilight (and I'm in my 20s...).",/review/rw2029119/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2011,Leofwine_draca,4," Sparkly vampires & one awful leading lady = a film that's tough to watch
","I'm about as far from this movie's demographic as you can get (I'm no 12-year-old girl), but in the interests of vampire cinema I forced myself to sit through this film in the hope of somehow enjoying it. Of course, I was bitterly resulted by what I saw, which is nothing more than an angsty teen romance that tries, and fails, to be a hip vampire movie. Vampire movies have long contained simmering sexuality – Chris Lee positively exuded it in his Hammer outings – but the theme is reduced to a superficial level in this film, as vampirism is just yet another problem – like acne and the in-crowd – that our young lovers have to deal with.",/review/rw2029119/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2008,PWNYCNY,1," Why was this movie made?
","Some movies are so good that they are talked about, often quoted and thought of almost with reverence decades after their first release. Twilight is not one of those movies. Twilight is fluff, utterly forgettable, and gives cause to wonder why anyone would want to make this movie in the first place. This movie is so nondescript and so devoid of anything that is even remotely interesting that calling it a bad movie would give it too much credit. In times past this movie would have been assigned to the B portion of a double feature and be given little if any notice. The story contains certain interesting features but at no time does it make any dramatic impact worth noting. The movie may work as escapist fare if you feel like going to the movies to take a nap, but given the high price of tickets today, that is not an advisable option. So if you feel like taking a nap, go watch this movie when it comes out on a DVD or better yet when it is shown on network television at which time you can start watching it and then go to sleep in the comfort of your own home.",/review/rw2029119/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2020,Impartial-Reviewer,," Didn't Know Vampires Need Public Education!
","Not completely sure if this should be considered a parody for the vampire sub-genre or an adaptation of a couple of teens meet in public school one of them Edward who belongs to a vampire clan and the other is a human Bella who stays with her dad, they both develop an attraction towards each other.",/review/rw2029119/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2022,I_Ailurophile,7," I can appreciate what this wanted and tried to be.
","To say that 'Twilight' carries baggage is a dire understatement. The books' reputation precedes them, carrying questionable writing and strong themes of abusive relationships, and it's impossible to watch the movies in 2022 without being aware of much derided special effects, acting, and more. At the same time, one tries to approach movies with an open mind, and it's important to recognize in the first place that these titles were written for a ""young adult"" audience, and all the horrid awkwardness that immediately greets us with scenes of high school age characters is actually very fitting, for good or ill. And secondly - there are a lot of recognizable performers here that have more than proven their capabilities elsewhere, before or and or since; I think most viewers should be well-rounded enough to recognize that even the best actors, given poor material to work with, will look bad in a lackluster feature.",/review/rw2029119/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2009,thesar-2,1," No fangs? Sunlight doesn't hurt? Oh, this MUST be a vampire film!
","'Twilight' was one of the most hilarious movies I've seen in awhile; at least that's how it started. Reminding me a lot of 'The Happening,' I found myself laughing out loud during the first half and then simply hating life during the last half. I have heard this was meant for teenage girls. Fine, I get it and I'm not one. However, how I wish more for them. They deserve so much more. It's absolutely no wonder why this movie dropped its audience 62% on weekend 2. There are so many points to cover for this two-hour tragedy, I'll at least attempt to cover the incredibly bad aspects: awful, laugh-out-loud acting and dialogue/narration, horrible soundtrack, special effects were downright amusing, the bad (""Johnny Suede"") hairdos and the desperate attempts at a franchise  let's just set up every scene to set the stage for the inevitable part II, III, etc. I'm just going to assume the people playing the parts (it's too nice to call them actors) read the original material. Well, the ""I can't live without you"" wooden dialogue seems like they are seriously reading from the book rather than playing the parts. And one of the worst aspects of this film was the fact that after all the lovey-dovey stares, (oh, God, the constant stares Bella and Edward give each other. STOP, please, God, STOP!) they seemed to forget one of the most basic elements in any plot  the adversary. OK. Well, let's introduce one 3/4s into the film in the shape of Brad Pitt. Why does he want Bella? To get back to the family? Why? Oh, I guess I'll have to wait for Part II. And yes, I plan on waiting in line for that film. I'm always in the mood for a good laugh or dozen.",/review/rw2029119/?ref_=tt_urv

7 December 2009,JoeytheBrit,," How is it possible to make a dull vampire movie?
","There's no doubting that I'm not a member of the intended market for this film (a good thirty years too old, alas) and it's equally true that I'm also of the wrong gender, but the phenomenal success of this film is puzzling to me. It's quite difficult to make an uninteresting film about vampires – although quite a few have succeeded – but this, the first of a franchise, set amongst a high school milieu recognisable to its target demographic, is as dull as the palette director Catherine Hardwicke chooses to paint her picture with.",/review/rw2029119/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2009,TheLittleSongbird,5," Not a terrible movie but all means, but not exactly my cup of tea
","I didn't think Twilight was a terrible movie as such, but it is not a fantastic one either. I will admit it wasn't my cup of tea, hence my mixed score, but there are redeeming qualities. I haven't read the book, so I can't judge its faithfulness or lack of to the text. I am going to start with the negatives. The dialogue felt very clunky and awkward, and I honestly felt the actors didn't have that much to work with. The plot takes a very long time to get going, and while it gets going, there were parts that felt underdeveloped sadly. And there were a number of bits towards the beginning that were unintentionally funny, and I think that was to do with Robert Pattinson. He is a real heart-throb I know, but his acting came across as rather hammy and even overdone. When me, my family and my sister's boyfriend saw it at the cinema, there was a lot of laughter at the scenes where the character Edward Cullen was staring into the camera. However, there are some good points. Kristen Stewart does give an assured performance in the lead, and Cam Gigandet does give one of the better performances of the movie. The soundtrack was somewhat decent, the camera work was good on the most part, and the scenery was splendid. Overall, I had mixed feelings on Twilight, it wasn't bad or good, just a little on the average side. It was a vampire movie but without the bite. 5/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2029119/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2020,brookenichole-98054,10," Gets me every time.
","I love Twilight and the whole saga. I'm not ashamed of it because I personally think they are some of the best films. Every scene is captured beautifully and the romance is compelling. The story flows naturally and made me excited the whole way through. The acting definitely improves, but for what we're given, it's quite good. And I got some laughs out of it.
Overall, I love this movie and it's definitely worth your time.",/review/rw2029119/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2008,Jacques98,1," Liberate te ex inferis: save yourself from hell . . . by not watching this.
","The only reason I never read Twilight when it first came out, long before it was popular, was because I read a book review stating that it was a clichéd and traditionaltwo things that I hate more than anything. The only reason I watched the movie was so I could actually understand what the vast majority of America was talking about when they raved about it. I came with low expectations and an open mind. I reassured myself, after all, I do enjoy love stories when they're original and memorable, so this couldn't be too bad, right? Three hours later, I left the theater feeling as if I was just released from a torture device and struggled desperately to my car on weak legs that just walked through hell on earth. Is my last sentence melodramatic? Maybe, but compared to the cheesy melodrama that IS the plot of Twilight, me sitting through that atrocious movie looks downright life-or-death.",/review/rw2029119/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2009,Quinoa1984,2," whoever you are, girl or boy, man or woman, Twilight is shoddy, pretentious film-making
","Look, whoever-you-are-readers, I'm not a teenage girl. I'm a 20-something gent who just likes watching movies, usually good ones. I can also go for the occasional really stupid/fun bad movie or incredible guilty pleasure. With Twilight, I knew it was, according to what I heard and read and seen about it, *meant* for teenage girls, I suppose, since it's one of those super dated and tried-and-whatever stories of a girl falling for a guy she's not supposed to and bad stuff happens - only with vampires.
