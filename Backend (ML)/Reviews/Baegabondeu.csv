","First of all, I have to say that I'm generally not a fan of biopics, they just aren't the type of movie I seek out. I got tickets to the sneak preview and my wife really wanted to go. Anyway, that preamble out of the way, I really did enjoy the movie.",/review/rw3425691/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2018,paulclaassen,7," Feel-good inspirational film.
","If ever there was a feel-good movie, this is it! Based on a true story, this film is suspenseful, dramatic and hilarious all in one, resulting in an insanely entertaining feature. Taron Egerton is brilliant as hero Eddie Edwards. He conveys emotion so well that you feel every feeling, every failure and every triumph. He is perfect as the nerd, likable hero and champion. Hugh Jackman is perfectly cast as a has-been champion who unwillingly becomes Eddie's coach. His 'Bo Derek' scene is fabulously hilarious and brilliantly acted.",/review/rw3425691/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2016,RforFilm,8," Eddie the Eagle is no downhill crash; it flies with upbeat spirit and lands with a comedic tone.
","As a Southern-Californian, snow might as well come from a different world. We receive at the most, a few flurries in the winter, but even then, it needs to be on a full moon on a leap year if it's not Tuesday. That said, we can still provide a wealth of athletes in sports that are played in the winter. Both local ice hockey teams, the Anaheim Ducks and the Los Angeles Kings, have won the Stanley Cup and are seen as some of the best hockey teams in America. Shaun White, famous snowboarder, hails from San Diego and Michelle Kwan, the figure skater, is from the L.A. area.",/review/rw3425691/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2016,lisafordeay,9," Finally got to see this movie and it was really nostlagic and feel good
","Eddie The Eagle stars Taron Egerton,Hugh Jackman,Jim Broadbent and Christopher Walken and tells the true story of a young British boy named Eddie(Egerton)who dreams of being an Olympic skier ever since he was a little boy. His father of course(Keith Allen)doesn't want Eddie to become an skier but a plasterer. Now all grown up Eddie goes to the headquarters in England (led by Tim McInerney from the live action 101 Dalmatian movies)who tells Eddie that he just isn't good enough to become a skier. All that changes however for Eddie as he travels to Germany and tries the 40m jump,the 60m jump but failed at the 60m jump,that is until he sees a tough cookie named Bronson Peary(Hugh Jackman)a former Olympic skier who lost out a long time ago and all he does is drinks heavy and smokes. At first Bronson doesn't want to help Eddie out as Eddie,but the two form a bound and he helps Eddie compete with the Olympic games by travelling all over from Austria and even Canada. But will Eddie's dreams of winning the Olympics in 1988 come true?",/review/rw3425691/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2016,ThomasDrufke,7," Important Thing is Not to Win, But to Take Part
","Everyone loves a good underdog story, and sports films have always been a good avenue for those stories to thrive. I know a lot of people like to complain sometimes about 'biopics' and how they should be as close to the source material as possible, but I look at it a different way. I go to the movies for an experience. Whether that be to laugh, cry, smile, or whatever, I go for the experience. If a film would be better off taking plenty of liberties, I'm all for it. Eddie the Eagle definitely took that philosophy, and for the most part, it really worked.",/review/rw3425691/?ref_=tt_urv

","The British love a plucky loser. ""Eddie the Eagle"" tells the astonishing but true story of everyman plasterer Eddie Edwards who qualified for, and then competed in, the Calgary Olympics in 1988 (probably most famous for those other plucky losers – the Jamaican bobsleigh team of Disney's ""Cool Runnings"" fame). I have absolutely no idea how the traditionally more success-driven and competitive American audience will see it, but the packed English showing I attended all clearly loved this film as a feel-good classic.",/review/rw3425691/?ref_=tt_urv

","The movie is based on a real story and you kind of will be able to predict many of the things happening. So it is predictable, but that does not make it less fun to watch. Even if it's just for seeing Wolverine being as cold as possible (which seems impossible, I know). But while Hugh Jackman is great, it's the main actor/character who steals the show (quite literally).",/review/rw3425691/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm a sucker for an underdog story. Movies like ROCKY always get to me. I find myself cheering along the hero of the film in the hopes that they will achieve their dream, that they will win, that they will become larger than life. EDDIE THE EAGLE is that type of film. Based on a true story it's not about what ski jumper Eddie Edwards achieved but more about the journey he had to get there.",/review/rw3425691/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2016,dave-mcclain,8," ""Eddie the Eagle"" soars!
","We all have a dream or have had a dream at some point, at least. You may not have achieved your dream (yet), but I'm sure you remember what it is, even if you're not currently pursuing it. You may have been stopped or been hindered from seeing your dream come true because people told you it wasn't realistic or refused to support you when you needed them to (or both). Or maybe you chose to give up on that dream because you decided yourself that it wasn't practical or because you came to believe that you were too old, too busy, too poor, too ""whatever"" to dream anymore. If any of this sounds familiar, then ""Eddie the Eagle"" (PG-13, 1:45) just might be your kind of movie. (And if ALL of this sounds familiar, you need to drop everything and go see this movie immediately – before it's too late!) The movie poster says ""Inspired by a Dream Come True"". That's appropriate (even if it's also a bit of a spoiler). In other words, this film is indeed inspired by a true story, but it's a highly fictionalized account of what really happened. There really is an Eddie Edwards who was nicknamed ""The Eagle"" and became Britain's only ski jumper in order to realize his childhood dreams of Olympic glory at the 1988 winter games in Calgary. Except for a few more details, that's about where the similarities between the film and reality end. Personally, I think the omitted details of Edwards' story are even more interesting than what appears on screen, but maybe they were left out to simplify the movie or make it even more of a crowd-pleaser. If that was the goal, mission accomplished! The filmmakers did, however, cast an actor who could act and be made to look like the real Edwards, right down to his gestures. It is impressive.",/review/rw3425691/?ref_=tt_urv

","Although his character wasn't real, it still made this biopic movie really well deserved as a feel good one to watch! I've heard of the real Eddie The Eagle on and off throughout the years, but I never knew exactly who he was in deep detail until a few days ago!

","I've seen some sport films through the years but I've actually never seen one about ski jumping. Eddie the Eagle is the truth based story of the British ski jumper Michael ""Eddie"" Edwards who participated in the 1988 Olympic winter games in Calgary, Canada. Eddie has since childhood, dreamed of becoming an Olympic participant. When he gets older and is denied to compete in downhill skiing by the British committee, he decides to try ski jumping instead. The problem is that the Olympic games is one year away and Eddie has never before in his life tried ski jumping.

","For as simplistically structured and utterly predictable as ""Eddie the Eagle"" is, it's only more amazing that it winds up being such a triumph of a film. A major-minor film, if you will; one that will be casually embraced or dismissed by critics (much like its titular hero) but truly loved and appreciated by audiences, especially audiences who love watching the underdog come out on top. While part of my unspoken duty as a film critic is to demand more from a film, to do so with ""Eddie the Eagle,"" a film that plays it safe and keeps everything entertaining thanks to its committed cast and the respectful treatment of its subject, seems foolish given on how well it stands on its own two-feet.",/review/rw3425691/?ref_=tt_urv

","Eddie the Eagle (2016): Dir: Dexter Fletcher / Cast: Taron Egerton, Hugh Jackman, Christopher Walken, Jo Hartley, Edvin Endre: Feel good true story inspired film about one's ability to dream big. Taron Egerton dons thick glasses to portray this British underdog who dreams of skiing the big jumps in the Olympics while representing England. He meets much opposition beginning with his father's discouragement despite happy cheers from his mother. His competition is less than good sports and apply cheat tactics to roadblock his progress. Finally the officials behind these events attempt every dirty trick to prevent him from moving forward. This is surprisingly well written and paced so effectively that we can forgive the formula and just celebrate its innocence. The one annoyance given is the clichéd and pathetic rival players or authority figures working against Eddie. Egerton makes an interesting transformation as Eddie playing off his naive nature with humorous innocence. We root for him as he attempts several steep and dangerous ski jumps only to crash to a crumpled heap on the ground. Yet through determination he sets his goals high. Hugh Jackman plays Bronson Peary, a former ski champion whose career faded as his alcohol abuse settled in. He reluctantly coaches Eddie and finds inspiration returning. Christopher Walken makes an appearance as someone who observed the fall of Peary's talent. Rounding it out comically is the opposite reactions of Eddie's parents. Dream big and never give up as one might discover that life's biggest jumps are God's ultimate gifts. Score: 9 / 10",/review/rw3425691/?ref_=tt_urv
