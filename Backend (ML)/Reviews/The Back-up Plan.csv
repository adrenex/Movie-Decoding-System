23 August 2004,bbhlthph,7," Not a Harlequin style romance.
","Before I comment on this film two introductory remarks are necessary. (1) I recommend anyone who is aware of the way in which it was panned by the critics (""puerile self conscious euro-trash"", etc) to forget these reviews. I believe it is an unusually rewarding work to see. (2) The title is very misleading, just reading it one cannot be aware of the irony with which it must have been chosen, and anyone expecting to see the film equivalent of a Harlequin novel needs to be warned in advance.",/review/rw0643226/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2009,Quinoa1984,5," at best a few curious intellectualized moments and some (appropriately) uncomfortable real sex. the rest...
","Someone hit the proverbial nail-on-the-head with Romance. A critic wrote that it's like a ""bad update of an Antonioni film"", and I think that's about as fair a description as one could ask for. It may also depend on how you feel already about Antonioni and his depiction of the precise lack of love or responsiveness of emotional contact in people - or, perhaps, if you've even actually seen an Antonioni movie. While Catherine Breillat probably (and, I would admit, rightfully) considers herself a thoughtful, passionate filmmaker interested in passionless people and in trying to pick apart the thoughts (or anti-thoughts) of a character like Marie, I have to ask after a while, in a film that doesn't have Antonioni-stature direction or compositions: what's the point? We have seen women like this in other movies, in loveless relationships or going out to spread or fulfill their empty wishes or such with others. Such as, yeah, Antonioni, but others too.",/review/rw0643226/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2006,jotix100,7," Romancing Marie
","Marie and Paul, who are lovers, are a mismatched pair. The fact that Marie's sexual expectations are not fulfilled by the elusive Paul, can be traced to the fact that he is a model, who might be bisexual and who might care for Marie, or just be repulsed by her directness. The sad fact is that Marie feels abandoned by the same man she loves.",/review/rw0643226/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 1999,Chris_Docker,8," A movie about realising identity - not about gender
","I was very confused at the end of 'Romance' as to whether I liked it or not, and whether I thought it was a good film or not. The best bit for me was probably the Q&A with director Catherine Breillat at the end. She was (especially with the help of a translator) very interesting and articulate - whether one agreed with her or not - and I found the film a valuable commentary on her thoughts rather than the other way round.",/review/rw0643226/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2001,Infofreak,," Why all the fuss?
","Romance achieved a lot of attention in Australia as it was initially banned. Now it's available from any decent video store so every adult can see what the fuss was all about. I think few of them will be able understand why the censors had so much problem with it. Basically you have several hard-ons and a bit of bondage in the middle of a talky French art-house movie. The fundamental problem with Romance is we can never understand what Marie sees in Paul. It's as simple as that. If we COULD understand then perhaps we'd have a provocative and thought-provoking examination of love, sex, loyalty and betrayal. But we don't. It's not to say the movie isn't worth watching, just don't expect too much. Last Tango In Paris was much braver and confronting (albeit less explicit) nearly thirty years ago. Closer to home, Breaking The Waves shares some similar themes and situations, and is a much more successful and emotionally involving experience.",/review/rw0643226/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2001,SanDiego,," Skip the R-rated version and go for the NC-17 version.
",Though I have a comprehensive review below I wanted to add that some comments here are from people who saw a severely edited version of the film (the sex scenes removed or cropped off).  This would be similar to removing the battle scenes from Star Wars.,/review/rw0643226/?ref_=tt_urv

3 November 1999,alice liddell,4," Not as dreadful as you've read, but too much TALK.
","Men hate it.  Probably because it's not quite the pornography its detractors accuse it of.  Women love it.  Because it restores a woman's voice to the erotic?  It also offers insultingly implausible solutions to genuine traumas; lacks the empathetic courage to embrace the dreamlike possibilities of its heroine's quest; and suggests motherhood as a woman's most fulfilling role.  The film only becomes dull in the second half, and is more amusing than you might think, but the dreary visuals, trite metaphors, unimaginative use of voiceover and dialogue, and self-pitying acting soon become enervating.",/review/rw0643226/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2009,Meven_Stoffat,1," Quick!!! Somebody get this girl laid!!!
","This is the second Breillat movie I've seen. And I already agree with the haters. Catherine Breilat is a pretentious hack, and this movie proves it. Watching this film, I kept thinking ""Breillat needs to get laid, so that she can stop making these 'MEN ARE EVIL!' films"".",/review/rw0643226/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2004,Coventry,2," Only half as interesting as it looks...
","I really wanted to enjoy this film but it just didn't work out. I was hoping to see a realistic and perhaps even educational story about relationship-conflicts and adultery but, to my regret, I saw an incredibly pretentious and isolated film...All very stylish and dared... I won't deny that... but overall un-involving and illogical. It's about a young woman who goes out on a sexual odyssey because her lover does NOT want to have sex with her. The obvious decision would be: brake up with him if it really bothers that much!! But no, she doesn't and therefore we get to see a series of semi-pornographic sequences and a whole lot of philosophical mumbo jumbo! Writer/director Catherine Breillat really tests one's attention span here. In general, I love films that are slow and atmospherically built sequence by sequence but this Romance X was a bit exaggerated. Sex sequences are explicitly observed and then you receive a whole analysis of them...You either appreciate this style or dislike it. Also, it didn't bother me that much, but Romance X clearly is a ""woman's film"". The portrayal of several men in this film isn't exactly anything to be proud of. Either way, there are better things to waste your life with...",/review/rw0643226/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2005,insomniac_rod,," Caroline Ducey worths the watch.

3 March 2017,MOscarbradley,2," Porn minus the fun.
","Gone is the romance that was so divine, except in the case of Marie and Paul there never appeared to be much romance to start with, nor sex either which is why Marie goes in search of her Mr Goodbar. Sex in the movies is only interesting if the context is interesting which is why porn gets boring very quickly. Catherine Breillat's film is boring because the characters are boring and because they exist in a vacuum, in this case a sexual vacuum. It's like being made to spend time with dull acquaintances who don't get along, in or out of the bedroom.",/review/rw0643226/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2008,lastliberal,8," It's certainly not Wedding Crashers!

","Same as the likewise French exploitationer ""Baise-moi"", which was released almost at the same time as this movie, there are some scenes of hardcore pornography added. But as ""Baise-moi"" only concentrates on surface visuals the message of ""Romance"" is to explain the emotional conflict of love and sexuality between men and women - told from a female point of view.",/review/rw0643226/?ref_=tt_urv

8 December 2004,Maciste_Brother,1," Precociously awful
","I never thought in my life that I'd see such a bad movie made in France. It's almost a first. I'm not saying that I've never seen a lot of bad movies from France. I have. But not THIS BAD! The main problem here is the director. The film looks like it was a made by a precocious little 12 year old girl who was told by everyone around her that she's very smart and advanced for her age and someone gave her the money to make a movie and the result feels like a 12 year old kid juggling adult themes all with the subtlety of an Ally McBeal episode. This movie reeks. Forget the so-called controversy about the sex scenes. The direction, the script, the acting are the real controversial aspects of ROMANCE, because they're so freaking bad!

8 February 2011,Imdbidia,8," Essay about the Female Erotic

28 September 2000,SanDiego,," The truth about the sex scenes...and why they are there.
","First and foremost, there has been some comment regarding the final explicit scene regarding oral sex whereas the man's penis is shown to be in the woman's hand not in her mouth.  This is a framing device that matches a scene at the beginning of the film whereas we quite clearly and unquestionably see the penis in her mouth (the first so-called ""shocker"" of the film).  Since we can guess that both scenes were shot at the same time we can easily deduce that there was no attempt to fool the audience, what the director wanted us to see is quite literally what we see, and what the actors and director chose to show us.  We have determined from the first scene that neither the actor nor the actress mind performing this scene in front of the camera (be mindful, even though her mouth is on the man's penis, there is no actual sex).  Quite clearly the FINAL scene was NOT an oral sex scene but merely an erotic stroking of her chin upon the man's penis (a common technique in sensual massage, which tells us that those commenting have had much less experience during their lives than the actors did while filming this movie!).  This is an important detail however because it tells us much which happens between these two scenes...and literally the moral of the story.  At the beginning of the film we meet Marie, she wants sex, lusts for it, and her mate is unable to match her desire.  Her mate seems quite satisfied with the sensual contact, but for one reason or another (never quite clear) sex is something that is not on his agenda.  The shock of the audience seeing her pull his penis out and provide oral massage is merely because we have not seen this type of explicit scene in mainstream cinema.  In comparison to other scenes in the film it is really quite nothing, and a similar scene at the end would have proven anticlimactic. She spends the rest of the film searching to quench her sexual desires, yet sensuality is something that is not on HER agenda.  So she has meaningless sex considering herself just a ""hole"" until by the end of the film she has experienced all that she is going to experience for a while, returns to her mate, and meets him on his terms, for a night of sensual pleasure...namely the final scene as described above (with penis seen in her hand--yes you were suppose to see it there!)

11 April 2019,Bored_Dragon,4," Pretentious crap
","I have encountered this film on some list of the most controversial films of all time. It was one of the few I haven't already seen, so I decided to correct this oversight. It turned out that I didn't miss much. The author of this film is not nearly intelligent, deep and interesting as she thinks she is, and the film completely misses its goal, if I understood it well, and I think I did. Nudity and pornography are anything but erotic, the philosophical aspect is superficial, banalized and prone to generalization, and the film is not shocking but quite boring. It is not unwatchable, but it is largely irritating and total waste of time.",/review/rw0643226/?ref_=tt_urv

","Oh, the existential anguish, to feel like lost luggage! For the first fifteen minutes, I thought the problem might just be a goofy translation. But it soon became apparent that the filmmaker wasn't kidding, so I pretended she was and had a good laugh. Caroline Trousselard was a trouper, though. Sublimely silly, as only the French in full Sartre mode can be. The ""This Is Spinal Tap"" of French sex flicks, despite (or perhaps because of) its pretensions to art.

25 May 2000,eibon09,10," The Best Foreign Film of 1999
","Romance(1999) is an example of couragous film-making with a taboo breaking presentation.  What I find amazing is that the sex scenes in were real and were shown in a realistic manner.  This film deals with a woman who's in search of control in her life and needs someone who she can have an emotional as well as a physical relationship with.  Romance(1999) is a film that deserved an Oscar for Best Foreign Film for its a movie with raw intensity, and tremendous acting.  This film not only deals with the physical aspects of sex but also the emotional aspects as well.",/review/rw0643226/?ref_=tt_urv
