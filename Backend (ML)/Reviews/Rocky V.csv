27 January 2016,cinemacy,8," Much more than just fart jokes, 'Swiss Army Man' is deep & unpredictable
","Usually, fart jokes are associated with bad raunchy comedies in the likes of Adam Sandler's recent career, or really uncreative family movies. Insert, 'Swiss Army Man' â€“ the Sundance title that's generated the most vocal reaction amongst festival goers for it's ridiculous, now infamous, farting dead body played by Daniel Radcliffe. This is only how the film begins, and let's just say it toots even louder from there.",/review/rw3798648/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2016,freekyfridays,10," Love it or hate it, it's one film from 2016 that most definitely will not be forgotten.
","The Jury Prize for Best Directing caused more than a few controversies at this year's Sundance Film Festival with some audience members walking out, while others complained about the film's uncouth behavior. What might get lost in the mix is how impressively this unique and uncompromised debut feature can be seen through completely opposite lenses.",/review/rw3798648/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2016,Ramascreen,10," The best movie of 2016
","When you look up the word 'original' in your dictionary, you might find a poster of SWISS ARMY MAN next to the definition. This is simply the best movie of 2016 in my book. It's outrageous, it's visionary, it's full of humor and heart. To those of you who often complain that there's nothing original to watch in theaters anymore, writing/directing team Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert have come to the rescue.",/review/rw3798648/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2016,mike-82085,10," Don't be fooled by many of the reviews; Swiss Army Man is a rigorous and unflinching portrayal
","In my view, Swiss Army Man is an unflinching and clinical documentary of the emotional life of a mentally ill, severely repressed adolescent boy named Hank, whose diminished mental capacity has been exacerbated by a repressive and dominant father. The father's violations have induced excessive shame with regard to normal bodily functions (farting, pooping, fantasizing about girls, masturbating); the boy is disturbed by the powerful sexual urges experienced by any teenager, and is painfully shy, lonely and socially isolated. Hank has been laughed at by others; his father has called him retarded and presumably diminished his sense of self in plenty of other ways. His mother appears to be kinder towards him but his father is dominant.",/review/rw3798648/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2018,orion-canning,10," For everyone who thinks this movie is just fart jokes...
","I was compelled to respond to all the 1 star reviews. As someone who actually really dislikes fart jokes, finding them to be lazy writing that only attempts to appeal to the lowest common denominator, I can sympathize with anyone who would be skeptical of this movie at first.",/review/rw3798648/?ref_=tt_urv

24 September 2016,BecauseIAmBATMAN,9," Creatively mind-blowing
","One of the most insanely creative and original film ever. Its often strange with crude humour about farting corpses and boners, but there certainly is a deeper meaning to it rather than being crudeness for the sake of it. ",/review/rw3798648/?ref_=tt_urv

",".. is actually a very good description of this movie.
Like many others I imagined it to be some kind of cast away with a corse for the volleyball but it was suprisingly different. At this point you should know that farting is an essential plot device in this movie and that it is actually used to underline it's statements. If you cant get over this fact don't even watch it, because it is very heavily featured.",/review/rw3798648/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2016,pathriciagullberg,10," Heartfelt and beautiful
","This movie was truly beautiful. Don't get scared of the dead body and farts, stick with it until the end. It contains beautiful scenes of friendship and love and acceptance of all human beings. Really teaches you about a deeper mening about life. The desperation of being unloved and all alone, and the lengths we go to fight it and find some deeper mening in life. It's not just about action and saving the girl, sometimes you just have to find the one person in life willing to accept you for you. Perfect movie for the society of today, where so many suffer from depression and loneliness that could be cured if someone would just be willing to take the time to accept weirdness.

25 April 2017,deloudelouvain,3," Weird doesn't mean funny
","Swiss Army Man is one of those movies that will divide everybody. You will or hate it or love it. I just hate it. And I'm normally not that picky. But when a movie doesn't make any sense at all then I get bored, in this case really bored. I'll give it a three star rating just for the fart jokes, because fart jokes are always funny. For the rest the story-line is just weird and most of the time ridiculous. But not ridiculous in a funny way. Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe didn't act bad or so, it's just the story that is bad. I honestly don't get why this movie gets such a high rating on here. I saw so much better movies with a lower score that sometimes I wonder how we can all be so different when it's about taste. I would not want to debate with somebody that liked this movie because that's just wasting my time and I already wasted enough time watching this nonsense.",/review/rw3798648/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hank Thompson (Paul Dano) is a castaway on a deserted island. He's preparing to hang himself when a body (Daniel Radcliffe) washes ashore. Using body gases, he rides the body like a jet ski back to the mainland. He starts talking to the body giving it the name Manny and teaching it rudimentary skills.

26 September 2016,Boristhemoggy,1," Probably the most ridiculous film I've ever watched.
","I love Paul Dano, so watching him make friends with a corpse that farts, gets an erection, talks, sings and dances is quite surreal. Dano's acting is as usual excellent and that's the only real positive I have to say about the movie. Daniel Radcliffe is not bad playing the corpse, but to be fair I have no precedence for anyone acting as a farting, singling dancing corpse so I can only guess he was good, someone else might have done it better or worse. I get that's it's a fantasy film, but I would call Lord of the Rings fantasy, not this tripe. I think they put fantasy simply so people were less harsh in their critique about it. Anyone who says they like it is in my opinion trying to be 'arty' and pretentious cos no-one could sit through an hour and a half of this tripe and truly think it was fun. Don't waste even 3 minutes on it, really, it's utter drivel.",/review/rw3798648/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2016,dave-mcclain,1," ""Swiss Army Man"" is like a rusted version of the tool mentioned in its title - potentially multi-purpose, but basically useless.
","According to the Cambridge English Dictionary, the word ""weird"" means ""very strange and unusual, unexpected, or not natural"". However, most people use the word as a way to demean and dismiss anything that they don't agree with, understand or are not a part of, the implication being something like ""everything that I do, say and think is normal, but everything different from that is just weird."" In short, the proper use of ""weird"" is for things ranging from the unusual to the unnatural, but things that are simply different from a given individual's experience don't quite qualify. Now, having made that distinction, I'm here to tell you that ""Swiss Army Man"" (R, 1:37) fits any and every definition of ""weird"".",/review/rw3798648/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2016,ez-xbox,10," A strange, brilliant, and mind blowingly hilarious self aware film
","Like abnormal? See this. Like intelligent? See this. Like funny. SEE THIS! Swiss Army Mans diversity was not only noticeable but its strangeness was not only quirky but hilarious. This is easily the best comedy of 2016. It has Daniel Radcliffe who was perfect for Manny, and Paul Dano who was also perfect for Hank. I swear there is no way of telling this is Daniels first film from the perfected direction and writing. The humor has funny build up and is really farcical. I think this film did everything correctly with how it wanted to do it. I recommend this to film goers who like strange but intact.",/review/rw3798648/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2017,kosmasp,10," More than just a one joke idea/film
","Yes you can reduce this to the one thing that's probably very prominent in the trailer. But the farting ""joke"" is more than meets the eye. You can smell, I mean tell by watching. Seriously though, the movie does not run out of ... fumes. You know it's easy making even more jokes, but the movie itself or the filmmakers are serious about being funny and inventive at the same time.",/review/rw3798648/?ref_=tt_urv

18 October 2016,Horst_In_Translation,2," An abomination that fails with all its ambition
","""Swiss Army Man"" is a 95-minute full feature film from this year (2016) and it is the first long movie by writers and directors Daniel Scheinert and Dan Kwan. It is basically a two-man show starring Paul Dano (""There Will Be Blood"") and Daniel Radcliffe (""Harry Potter""). The former is stranded on an island and the latter plays a corpse who becomes best friends with Dano's character. But it is never clear at all what is going on inside this film. Is it all a delusion from Dano's character? It seems likely as we see not only him interacting with a corpse, but the corpse even moves and replies back to him. Sounds to me as if Dano's character completely lost his mind on the island and we see the direct effects and consequences. So from that perspective (and from others too), it is actually a somewhat realistic film, but all the filmmakers' ambition when it comes to authenticity is lost quickly because of the way they try to make it entertaining and funny. The jokes are about farting (it is not funny for over 20 minutes the same again and again, even if it may be true biologically), about thinking of your mate's mother when masturbating, about boners and about vomiting into each other's faces and drinking the puke afterward. So yeah, the comedy approach here is high school humor of the worst kind.",/review/rw3798648/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2017,dbs630-697-952794,1," w. t. f.? Perfect last words
","Perfect last line of the film. That was about the summation of this absolute abomination of a film. I never watched a preview never knew anything about this movie until I turned it on. At first I thought it was going to be a movie like ""Castaway"" that showed some textbook uses for a corpse in survival (shedding light on the wasted pilots bodies that Tom Hanks buries). Wow was I wrong. My second thought about a half hour in was that maybe he was on some Pacific island where he would come across some WWII ruins to add to the story and that he was perhaps just loosing his marbles to a corpse friend. Then about an hour in I started to wonder how a man lost on a deserted isle (as the description states) could have enough strength to hump around a bloated decomposing body that probably weighed over 200 lbs. Not to mention how he could drink the bile that came out of his mouth and not vomit at the very smell. How is it that he wasn't waking up to a body covered in crabs every morning? Or seagulls? Then it finally came about 20 minutes from the end. He's a homeless mentally ill stalker who's been camping out behind his victims house stealing their trash and making crafts with it. What could have been the making of a great suspense thriller was wasted on fart and boner gags and just flat out duping the audience to watch it for the first hour and a half by lying to them and not in an ironic good plot structure way but just by confusing us to death. In my opinion the best part about the movie was the woman's reaction at the very end. ""Wtf?""",/review/rw3798648/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'll admit it, this movie was weird as f*** and certainly not a block buster but don't let that stop you. As weird as it can be (it will have you wtf'ing through out) its still full of deep meanings and hidden messages. its like a double sided coin, one side full of slap stick and off the wall comedy while the other has you thinking about life while hitting you right in the feels. its an interesting combination that shouldn't work but in my opinion is masterfully done to create an overall good movie that will leave you thinking yet with a smile on your face and a lot to talk about. go see it folks and don't let the beginning deter you, its got more to offer then just fart jokes.",/review/rw3798648/?ref_=tt_urv
