15 May 2021,arod_85,6," You're killing Me, Hollywood
","I cannot remember the last time I've seen a truly ""good""movie put out on the big screen. They appear to be getting more and more mediocre as the years go by. Those Who Wish Me Dead was no exception. Actors I used to love, all staring in movies with weak, cliche plots. Big names like Angelina Jolie, Tom Cruise and Denzel Washington hardly mean anything anymore. Nothing new or clever here. This movie is fine as background noise while you scroll through Instagram or Pinterest lazily on a late Saturday night but if you are looking for something to get into, this is not it.",/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2021,neil-476,6," Yes, but what was the point?
","When his father is killed while fleeing from hitmen, young Connor flees into the forest where he falls in with Hannah, a firefighter whose mojo was injured during a forest fire tragedy. Together they must escape not only the hitmen but also the firest fire they started.",/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2021,paulclaassen,4," Felt like a late night TV movie.
","If it wasn't for Angelina Jolie being cast in the lead, I might have mistaken 'Those who wish me dead' for a TV movie.",/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2021,wisemanfromtowne,2," A film paying homage to forest fires.
",Absolutely no story whatsoever to follow. I mean why did the two hitman go after the father? What did the boy's father write in that letter? What was the need for Tyler Perry's cameo scene? And Jolie was ridiculous with that bad wig on. So my only speculation is that it had to be a film paying homage to forest fires because nothing else made sense.,/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2021,JoBloTheMovieCritic,4," Those Who Wish Me Dead
",4/10 - I'm surprised at how well this movie was received given that it felt like everyone from the writers to the director and most of the cast phoned it in.,/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2021,SnoopyStyle,6," unremarkable thriller
","Forensic accountant Owen Casserly goes on the run with his young son Connor. His D. A. colleague has been murdered by an assassin team, Jack (Aidan Gillen) and Patrick Blackwell (Nicholas Hoult). He had uncovered high-powered political corruption. With no one to trust, he heads off to small town Montana where his brother-in-law Ethan Sawyer (Jon Bernthal) is a Deputy Sheriff. The assassin team catches up to him before that. His son Connor escapes and finds help from smokejumper Hannah Faber (Angelina Jolie).",/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2021,christopherluke-18264,6," Lose ends
","Decent movie. The loose ends were the most annoying to me. What was the info his father had? Other than Tyler Perry's brief cameo, who were the ""big bad"" who sent the hit men? What happened to them? Did the baby survive? I even sat through the credits hoping for a hidden scene... nope.",/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2021,Calicodreamin,8," Well made movie
","A well made and well rounded movie. The characters were well cast and well acted. A good mix of action, heartfelt moments, and a few comedic lines delivered just right. Loved Jolie's character and the kid did an amazing job.",/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," Sloppy, unbelievable, far-fetched and lazy writing with lots of plot and technical issues.
","Too many unnecessary scenes and infantile dialogue riddled with foul language you'd never expect to hear from those spewing it. There was way to much time spent on filler and not enough on substance. What was the point of that entire outdoor drinking on picnic tables act? The pick-up truck parachute and arrest scenes? The constant repetitive flashbacks only inching each time just a little more facts on her past incident also became annoying. Just spit it out, and move on with the current drama and all too little excitement. Never mind it was totally boring and pointless for the movies plot-line. Even the idea of the cat and mouse wasn't concluded, nor why it even started or who ordered it. The screenplay felt like it had random scenes cut out and/or was poorly edited. The 100 min runtime felt much longer with all the boring filler. I'm not sure if the book is as bad at the screenplay and direction, but this one had a great conceptual idea that ultimately burns out quickly. Jolie was the worst casting choice, and for the most part was unconvincing in her role and her acting abilities. Her swearing trying to act all tough with her long stringy hair was just getting annoying and unbearable. The little boy was more believable than her. Too bad, the premise was great, was it was poorly executed.",/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2021,ferguson-6,5," if not for AJ ...
","Greetings again from the darkness. Taylor Sheridan was Oscar nominated for his screenplay of the superb HELL OR HIGH WATER (2016). He also wrote and directed WIND RIVER (2017), wrote the screenplays for both SICARIO movies, and is the creative force behind the TV series ""Yellowstone"". He has excelled in generating slow-burn tension and conflict. For his latest film, he's back in the director's chair after co-writing the script with Charles Leavitt (BLOOD DIAMOND, 2006) and the 2014 novel's author, Michael Koryta.",/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2021,elliotjeory,2," Those that bore me to death
",This film is awful. There is no plot. Angelina Jolie's character is not believable. Little finger should of made project blue book season 3.,/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2021,kaefab,6," okey way to pass the time
","Its not the best movie ever but not the worst good action, you hate the bad guy they do a great job at it, the fire takes a back burner.",/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2021,matthewssilverhammer,3," More Pretentious Sheridan Tripe
","Taylor Sheridan directs straight-to-streaming-quality films but has somehow convinced people that he's prestigious. This is lazy grief porn that is so serious it's almost laughable. Every character is filled with cheap writerly motivations, and no amount of A-list, brow-beating acting can hide the sense that nothing unique or interesting is really happening here. Still, a pregnant lady sets some dudes on fire, so that's awesome.",/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2021,Gordon-11,," Intense and engaging
",I didn't expect this film to be so good. The fire and assassins provide plenty of adrenaline. There is a lot of emotional subplots the touches hearts too. I really enjoyed it.,/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2021,educatexan,7," A bit of refreshment, a bit of disappointment
","I basically enjoyed this movie. I don't require a movie to have a multi-level plot and deep character flaws to be entertained. Most everything was fine here. The actors did well with the script they were given. I didn't see anything wrong with the CGI as others have commented. The action was fine, and pretty much everything made sense.",/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,cdc123,1," Waste of time
","Completely predictable. Poorly written. Two dimensional characters. What were they possibly thinking? This is a ""paint by numbers"" film with two colors. And the title is awful. I'm just amazed at the mediocrity. Good grief what a total waste of time, money and talent.",/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,joiningjt,9," What's with all the hate? Excellent action film with heart!! Fantastic kid!!
","To those of you that said the 14 year old boy was annoying and a terrible actor, your not only DEAD wrong but couldn't carry his lunch box!! Its funny how the people that cut down others have NO talent or lack intelligence. All the actors we're excellent Angelina Jolie was very good as always but it wasnt her movie to shine it was the kids and he did!! Also people saying she was anorexic, because she's not FAT hey morons thin is HEALTHY!! And what does that have to do with acting. My hats off to the whole cast and crew EXCELLENT action thriller!!!!",/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv

7 May 2021,iamianiman,5," Those Who Wish to See this Movie...
","There are times when a movie comes out of nowhere, only a few weeks before its theatrical release, the trailer is released and the poster is revealed and we then only know that it's acted by some famous celebrities and this time around, it's Angelina Jolie. Those Who Wish Me Dead is one of those movies where it feels so sudden, and the next thing you know, it's right there in the list of 'Now Showing'.",/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv

20 May 2021,imseeg,7," Nothing spectacular, but still a decent thriller, with good acting and impressive photography.
","The bad:
Seen these kind of action thrillers before. They are pretty much all the same. There is nothing new to this story either and there are a few pretty implausible plot turns, that prevent it from becoming a spectacular thriller. BUT it is still a rather enjoyable action thriller, for those whose demands are not too high...",/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2021,classicsoncall,7," ""You got to win one, I see.""
","Against a backdrop of a huge forest fire, Forest Ranger Hannah (Angelina Jolie) attempts to lead a young boy (Finn Little) to safety after his father was murdered by a pair of brother hitmen. The premise for that murder was never made clear, only that the target was a forensic accountant who turned up something incriminating enough to warrant a hit on him and his employer as well. At the same time, Jolie's character suffers a guilt riddled angst over the deaths of three teenagers who perished in a separate fire when she miscalculated on the direction of the conflagration. Tied into the story is a small town sheriff (Jon Bernthal) and his pregnant wife, a survivalist who knows how to handle herself when the assassins come calling. The unseen stars of this vehicle were the special effects team who made the forest fire behave like a killer in and of itself, leaping across expanses of forest and river in a furious spectacle. Considering the nature of the story, the name of the film doesn't quite capture the essence of what occurred along the way, since the 'Me' in the title seems to refer to Jolie's character, who became an equal opportunity target of the vicious assassins only when she took the young boy Connor under her wing.",/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,aidanratesmovies,2," Shallow and mistoned little action thriller with literally no purpose
","An incredibly tedious, needlessly violent, and poorly compiled little action thriller- Those Who Wish Me Dead feels like a lost film that's been sitting on the shelf since the 90's- and honestly they should have kept it there. Angelina Jolie stars in this bizarre action thriller where she plays a smokejumper/firefighter character that is as generic as can be. She's your typical action heroiness, with a generic tragic backstory you won't care about for a moment. The film tries so hard to shove each characters pain down your throats, it's truly bizarre how you'll end up not caring about nearly a single one of them. The bad guys are as generic as can be, and the plot is never really explained- secret information is out there but we never quite learn what it is that's so important, and the film doesn't seem to really care- just as long as it finishes. Jon Bernthal and his characters wife played by Medina Senghore are perhaps the only remotely interesting characters throughout the film- but there presence is largely overshadowed and in the end rather pointless in the whole scheme of things. The film is weirdly violent for no reason, just trying to provide shocks from the audience without any true purpose. It just feels gross- it wants us to feel so bad that we sympathize with what is going on- but there is nothing to truly latch on and acre about. Some action scenes are entertaining, and I was intrigued at first by the plot, but in the end this film is just a huge mess and I don't think I'll remember it by the end of the day.",/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2021,paul_haakonsen,6," A fair enough thriller...
","I sat down to watch the 2021 movie ""Those Who Wish Me Dead"" here in 2021 as I was sort of made to do so, given the fact that my wife wanted to watch it. So I buckled in and went to watch it with her.",/review/rw7114590/?ref_=tt_urv
