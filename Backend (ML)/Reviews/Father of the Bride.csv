16 June 2022,Bgappl07,7," The Latino version
",I see all the mostly negative reviews of this movie and I'm actually surprised I know it's been done before but so have a lot of themes Andy Garcia can take anything and make it good Gloria Estefan is very good in her role and it's just a pleasant time to be had by all it's like nothing to pre ponder or post ponder but it makes some points and it was fun!!!,/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2022,christopherstamp,5," Standard Remake in this era style.
","Take a beloved movie - force fit, gender swaps, nationality and sexuality to appear inclusive. And at the end of the day - for the political cash grab using nostalgia to gain money.",/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2022,joriethomas,2," Nope
","I walked in with an open mind, the Steve Martin one was a remake and I loved it. Not to mention, I love Andy Garcia and Gloria Esteban but this was a waste of time. Not all remakes are bad but this one was. No heart, no humor, no enjoyability. Sad really.",/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2022,vittorio-13,3," Remake that forgot what made the original so great
","Look I have great respect for father character, but talk about wrong casting and wrong direction. This remake forgot what made the first and the remake such a good movie. It was the father of bride. The way the daughter acted you would think you want the father to leave the house. This movie lacked emotions, fun, and creativity. Yes it's a remake and everybody know what is going to happen and the original was the best the remake was great because of one guy Steve Martin the third round it lacked everything that made he first two so great. To bad it could have been great but just because you have a great location and you spend money it does not mean that the character of the movie would be good. To bad.",/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,lisafordeay,5," Good but I prefer the 1991 version
","Father of The Bride is a 2022 remake based on the 1950 original and the 1991 version of the same name. Starring Andy Garcia,Gloria Estefan and Isabella Merced,this version focuses on a Cuban family The Herrera's who are going through a tough time as Bill and his wife Ingrid(Garcia and Estefan) are going through a divorce. Things take a turn however when their oldest daughter Sofia announces that she is getting married to Adan Castillo(Diego Boneta).",/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2022,grlym-46849,1," Over the top negative
","I thought this was going to be like the Steve Martin version. A little of The father cliches, but mostly funny",/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2022,atdmv,2," Bashing traditional Latino values doesn't a good movie make
","Let's set aside that this is another remake no one asked for, and that you can't improve on the perfection of the 1990 version. They could have done something unique and amazing with the Latino culture of this movie - the traditions and cultural values. Instead, they decided to bash it with the modern values (lack thereof). This made for a bad movie with bad lessons in it.",/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,helenahandbasket-93734,1," But Why?
",You just know there's far too much money floating around Hollywood when there's enough to make this tragic excuse for a movie.,/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,jakethesnake-42007,2," Boring boring boring
","Don't bother wasting your time
On this bad remake. I give it props for not being an exact remake and adding a few things here and there but it's not enough to save this bland movie. The acting is so bad and the music played throughout the film is so bad. It's just a boring flat film. It's like they targeted the audience to be for 60 plus but then at other times it's not it's just a misfire.",/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2022,nmottel,2," Believe the bad reviews
","This two hour movie was interminable. They tweaked this remake to not only give us the Latino aspect, but added a divorce, a lesbian, lectures about the environment, provided by a wimpy script and terrible acting. Save yourselves and watch anything else.",/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2022,rich-fouts,2," A Film with no Soul
","Is this a comedy? A bad drama? Neither, it's just a bad movie. It begins with a great premise. Sofia, the daughter, proposed to Adan, they forego the Catholic wedding, but then everything moves into bad chaos as the groom's father starts to take over. While that could have been ripe for comedy it was just a bunch of yelling and screaming insults. The movie just treads water.",/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2022,jeppepalmari,8," I enjoyed this
",Don't know why people are so mad about this movie. I enjoyed it. It was perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon.,/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2022,JosiReviews,1," This movie is sooooo boring and predictable
","I finally said enough and turned it off 30 minutes early. I just couldn't anymore. This movie is boring, predictable, contrived, lacks chemistry between characters, and missing the comedy element that made the first two thrive. A lot of eye rolls on my end due to the ""didn't see that coming"" moments. Ugh. Just so bad.",/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2022,bangel3322,1," What on earth???
","Only managed to get 34mins into the film before switching off. Did not laugh once. I was expecting them to replicate the comedy of the original film, crossing over with something like My Big Fat Greek Wedding.",/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,killercola,9," Pretty pretty good
","I see a couple of ridiculously low score reviews but it's pretty clear it's the ppl who fear diversity. You know, the ""everything is woke"" knuckleheads. It's a solid movie, entertaining and well worth the watch.",/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2022,supermellowcali,3," It's like going to a wedding
","If you enjoy weddings and the family drama that goes with it, maybe you'll like this extremely well done, extremely boring story about an insecure old man, his daughter and her fiancee. I saw no reason to make this movie and, unfortunately, found it not even a little bit funny.",/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2022,TRISROUGE-83,1," BELIEVE THE BAD REVIEWS!!
",This movie is complete trash. Don't waste your time. There's nothing like the 1991 version with Steve Martin: fun and sweet movie with heart and soul.,/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,deborah-90424,1," Don't bother
","Boring, boring lacks the humor and sarcasm of both the Spence's Tracy version and the Steve Martin film. Boring and bad acting
From a mostly unknown cast. Gloria Estefan and Andy Garcia have no chemistry.",/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2022,bmiller59,8," Bravo
","Didn't know what to expect except after seeing the latest version, and I wondered WHY? Why attempt a remake and from a classic too, by the way that worked.",/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2022,cgvsluis,6," Not riddled with comedy, but a gorgeous backdrop for a Latin family drama carried by Andy Garcia.
","I am going to start by saying that the original Father of The Bride (1950) with Spencer Tracy, Joan Bennett, and Elizabeth Taylor is still my favorite, of course I am a classic film fan and in response to those who think that it is dated...I don't think the sentiment of a loving father who is going to miss his beloved daughter when she leaves the home in marriage is outdated, and if it is...I think that is a sad commentary on our current society. Second confession, I love Steve Martin and I think the version pairing him with Diane Keaton (1991) was comedy gold. And my final confession I have a Latin bias...so I was thrilled to see Andy Garcia back on the big screen especially in a role where he isn't a criminal and I really enjoyed seeing Gloria Estefan. I appreciated that they had Cuban actors playing Cuban roles and Mexican actors playing Mexican roles...and don't think I didn't catch the Latinx commentary.",/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv

","Oh my godddd! One question for the investors, producers of this #Movie!! Exactly WHAT. WAS. THIS? That I Wasted my precious time watching the first 15 minutes & used the FWD button through the rest of this WHATEVER it was?!?!?",/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2022,cejoyce-69284,1," Unwatchable
","Unwatchable and often offensive. The majority of characters are generally such horrible people I couldn't even make it through the entire movie. I hope the fianc√© cut and run - he'd really dodge a bullet. The one shining light is Isabella Merced. Even so, stick to the classic.",/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,rdstephenson,8," Latin cast adds fun twist to a great classic!
","If you like Latin culture, Miami views and a good romantic comedy, then see this movie. Love the blend between the Cuban and Mexican influences. The movie is definitely better second half of the film. !Que disfruten!",/review/rw8243945/?ref_=tt_urv
