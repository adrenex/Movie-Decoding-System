26 October 2022,IonicBreezeMachine,8," An engaging true-crime drama fronted by strong performances by Chastain and Redmayne
","Set in 2003 at Parkfield Memorial Hospital, Amy Loughren (Jessica Chastain) is a single mother with two daughters working as night nurse in the ICU who suffers from a heart condition but is without Health Insurance and must continue working long hours while keeping it a secret for the next few months before she's qualified for insurance. The hospital is soon joined by nurse Charles ""Charlie"" Cullen (Eddie Redmayne) who strikes up a friendship with Amy and even helps her during her cardiac episodes at his own expense. However when the death of a patient is put under internal review by Parkfield's risk mitigator, Linda Garran (Kim Dickens), the hospital brings in homicide detectives Danny Baldwin (Nmamdi Asomugha) and Tim Braun (Noah Emmerich), per the directives of the CDC for suspicious hospital deaths but are massively uncooperative only bringing them in 8 weeks after their internal review and with the body already released to the family and cremated. However, when Braun and Baldwin begin examining Charlie's history, they come to believe he may have been involved in the death as does Amy.",/review/rw8688922/?ref_=tt_urv

27 October 2022,madanmarwah,7," First rate acting of Jessica and Eddie in this dark, tense thriller.
","This one is a thriller dealing as it does with a serial killer who is a medical attendant in a hospital and who poisons patients during treatment. It is based on real events, there are no mysteries associated and the narrative is straightforward. The plot is therefore predictable and actually there is no suspense or surprise at any time. The movie apparently does full justice to the book titled "" A true story of medicine, madness and murder"". It is slow no doubt but director Tobias Lindholm must be credited for making it a dark, tense filled and sinister exercise which keeps the audience gripped. In this he is helped tremendously by talented actors Jessica Chastain and Eddie Redmayne who have given riveting performances which will surely fetch them awards. Eddie has nailed it as the vicious and brutal killer going about his task in a cold calculated manner. Jessica scores as the sick mother of two infant girls who has to cling on to her job in order to claim sickness insurance and continue working. In fact their acting is the highlight and mainstay of the movie. There are elements of realism throughout in the scenes at the hospital, of the deaths, and the following interrogations. Despite being slow I did not find the movie sagging or boring at any time because of the fine performances, a matching background score and catchy dialogue.",/review/rw8688922/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,grahamvandyke,7," Better Than Average Netflix Film
","After reading through some of the reviews here on IMDB, I could quickly surmise the people who didn't enjoy The Good Nurse had the movie being ""plain"" and ""boring"" as their main gripes. Granted, the film is slow with very little flash, but since when has this become a bad thing? The ADHD generation needs quick cutting and seizure inducing visuals to keep their attention, and this is the complete opposite.",/review/rw8688922/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2022,thewalkingpuns,6," perfromances better than the movie
","To me the standout of this film were the performances. But first looking at the movie itself it was a slow build up in the first half hour till charles comes onto the scene. I'm not sure though this film works as a thriller or mystery its more of a dark drama and if labeled as such would be better understood. But as based on real life films go this does at atleast do the job and is still an interesting watch. Eddie redmayne playes charlie, the nurse the film is about. He comes off as creepy and off putting making it a great role that he filled well. The same goes for jessica chastaine as amy, the other nurse who suspects something is up after a pateints death. Her performances is just as good and both are really good. Overall an interesting film to watch. Little slow in places but overall ok.",/review/rw8688922/?ref_=tt_urv

","Surprisingly captivating film. Really. You should not be fooled. If you didn't read any overview about this film prior to watching it, you'll think this is a a feel-good film because of the title. But it's a veritable thriller.",/review/rw8688922/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,pjdickinson-27822,8," Chilling
","The two leads are excellent in their roles and Redmayne deserves particular praise for his portrayal of a serial killer who committed his crimes as if they were just an ordinary part of his professional life. People like Cullen and Shipman, medical professionals who killed hundreds of people, are just unfathomable to ordinary people because of the enormity of their evil and Redmayne captures the mundane manner of Cullen's crimes which, like Shipman's, seemed to be just something they did at work in the same way most of us decide to tidy our desk or have extra sugar in our coffee. This kind of madness is beyond ordinary comprehension so it must be very difficult to portray. It's done very well but I'm not sure we get any insight into what drives such people to do what they did. Chilling, indeed.",/review/rw8688922/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2022,cdcrb,8," drop by drop.
","Its not really a mystery, since you can tell from the trailer who the bad guy is. Mysterious deaths in a hospital bring in the cops and silence from the management staff, with a reminder to the employees to keep their mouths shut. The acting is top notch, natch, with this cast. The two cops are very good and both new to me. Even tho you pretty much know what's going on, you'll be on the edge of your seat. Trust me. Supposedly based on a true story, its hard to believe this could actually happen over and over again. One really weird thing. Could eddie and jessica be twins. He really looks a lot like her. As i said, weird.",/review/rw8688922/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2022,ferguson-6,6," enabling evil
","Greetings again from the darkness. A film focusing on a single mom who works as a dedicated and caring and overworked ICU nurse, and who is diagnosed with a heart condition requiring a transplant, and who is trying to hang on to her job long enough to secure medical insurance, and who is a loving mom to her two young kids, would normally have enough drama and stress to carry the story. But that's not nearly enough for filmmaker Tobias Lindholm, who has written three outstanding screenplays: THE HUNT (2012), A WAR (2017), and ANOTHER ROUND 2020). Here he's directing a Krysty Wilson-Cairns (LAST NIGHT IN SOHO, 2021) adaptation of Charles Graeber's book about the man who may very well be the most prolific serial killer in history.",/review/rw8688922/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2022,danieljfarthing,8," High-quality slow-burn true-crime drama starring two superb talents at the top of their games
","In true-crime drama ""The Good Nurse"" Jessica Chastain & Eddie Redmayne (two superb talents at the top of their games) are nurses in a New Jersey hospital ICU where unbeknownst to them a mysterious death on their ward is under investigation (involving cops Nnamdi Asumgha & Noah Emmerich (and hospital 'Risk Manager' Kim Dickens)). As different facts slowly come to light the cops help Chastain begin to realise that her kindly close friend may actually be a killer... even a serial killer. Excellently directed with slow-burn tension by Tobias Lindholm, and written at good, engaging & growing pace by Krysty Wilson-Cairns, this is high-quality film-making.",/review/rw8688922/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2022,andrewbentley,8," Fantastic performance
",Eddie Redmayne is just effortlessly portraying a wide variety of characters but not nearly as many as I would like to see. His performances are always outstanding and this performance to date is my favourite for Best Actor. Eddie and Jessica carry what seems to be a not so thorough look on the serial killer that is Charles Cullen. Very basic and shocking story carried by a powerful lead performance. I recently just finished Dahmer and this was the perfect come down from what was one of the most thorough portrayals of a seriel killer I've seen on television. Highly recommend The Good Nurse and a solid 8/10 from me.,/review/rw8688922/?ref_=tt_urv

","Two Oscar winners go head-to-head in a dark and disturbing story inspired by true events. Jessica Chastain stars as Amy, an overworked nurse suffering from a debilitating illness that puts her in financial peril. She thinks she finds the perfect ally in Charlie (Eddie Redmayne), a new hire who helps with the workload, meds, and even her family. However, when patients begin dying under suspicious circumstances, Amy begins to question both Charlie and the system that brought him there.",/review/rw8688922/?ref_=tt_urv

",This 2 hr movie is based on real incident where a male nurse had murdered as many as 400 people by injecting fatal medicines into IV fluid bags. It took courage of another nurse to identify n get him confessed. Worth a watch to know the story of serial killer's madness but a very slow burner!,/review/rw8688922/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2022,segaltoons,10," One of the Best Films of the Year
","Dark and foreboding, this film starts slowly and builds eerily and suspensefully.. Don't let the darkness and the brutally realistic portrayals of medical procedures scare you away from one of the best films of the year. The performances by the two leads Jessica Chastain and Eddie Redmayne are intensely believable. Also worth mentioning are Noah Emmerich and Malik Yoba as the two detectives assigned to the case, they seem very real and unlike typical movie detectives. There are no car chases and no last minute capures. Just frustratingly slow and with infuriating bureaucracy. But it's clear that there is evil sometimes where you don't expect it.",/review/rw8688922/?ref_=tt_urv

",I was very much impressed with the direction of the film and the two main characters performance. I was very surprised by the high caliber of the film as a whole. Definitely not your typical Netflix crime drama. It felt more like an HBO movie. Both Eddie Redmayne & Jessica Chastain belt it out of the park.,/review/rw8688922/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,Kirpianuscus,," admirable acting
","After so many films/ series about same subject, it is difficult to not admit than the motif to see this film is, the first one, the presence of Jessica Chastain and Eddie Redmayne. As admirer of the last one, my expectations were not very high about subject and its development ( after Coma by Michael Crichton, I suppose, it is not just easy to innovate on this theme) so the target was the manner to play with the pieces defining his character of Redmayne.",/review/rw8688922/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,krasi_asenova,10," An Oscar worthy performance by both lead actors
","I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for the whole duration of the movie. Jessica was giving one of her best career performances, but so was everyone else. The case of Charles Cullen and the tragic death of his victims ( their death was impassionately called ""patient expiration"" in the movie) and how hospitals covered up his murders to avoid liability towards the victims' families is all very very disturbing. The creators of the movie placed the emphasis precisely on the greedy hospitals' carelessness and the brave but sick heart of the nurse who actually helped sentence this sick killer. An amazing picture by Netflix!",/review/rw8688922/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2022,katiefanatic-791-306918,10," Eddie Redmayne is coming for that second oscar!
","I saw this film two weeks ago at a screening with Jessica Chastain and Eddie Redmayne. I'm disabled and have been a fan of Redmayne's
Since his deserved oscar winning performance in 'the theory of everything'. I've had the pleasure of meeting him and he's one of the kindest gentlest souls. In this movie, he scared me half to death! His performance was phenomenal! I have always preferred subtle villains to over the top performances like Heath ledger in 'the dark knight'. Redmayne delivers here. He's absolutely chilling in this performance! I met him again after a screening and he was so kind and sweet and I told him he scared me half to death and he apologized. 2nd best film of the year, after 'thirteen lives' but I sadly don't think that film will get acting oscars. Redmayne would be well deserved for his second one here.",/review/rw8688922/?ref_=tt_urv

",This movie was based on a true story and it was adapted into a screen play and I could remember this happening seem like it was in the 1980s. Jessica chastein and Eddie We're excellent in this film and I hide it right back recommend this film. I thought the special effects were really decent the cinematography was very good and the fact that it was a true story is what drew me to this in the 1st place and I think that most people will find this movie very believable. So do yourself a favor if you like movies based on true stories and you really love this one here.

","I have not much to say about the movie. It's a proper movie based on a true story of yet another serial killer who took advantage of his work as a nurse to perform his nefarious deeds.
