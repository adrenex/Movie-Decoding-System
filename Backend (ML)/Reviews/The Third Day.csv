13 October 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Not too bad
","I finally gave in and gave Yellowjackets a try after hearing so many great things about it. I liked it much more than I thought I would, I'm actually mad at myself for putting it off as long as I did. All the twists and turns will keep on the edge of your seat every episode to the point it becomes addicting. It has everything you want in a good show...drama, mystery, comedy, action, etc. The acting is what really carries the show though. Melanie Lynskey deserves every bit of praise that she's been getting for her role. She's so good that it's the type of performance that's going to lead to even bigger things for her.",/review/rw8561739/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2021,aarpcats,7," It is NOT ""Lord of the Flies""
","Ã‘or is it ""Alive!,"" although that's what the people who watch one trailer and the first episode want you to think.",/review/rw8561739/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Pretty Good!
","Yellowjackets was so much better than I thought it was going to be. It has a very Lord of the Flies feel to it. I know a lot of people are comparing the two. I really wasn't that interested in it but after reading all the great reviews and having friends recommend it I thought I'd finally give it a chance. I'm so glad I did because it was really good. It's an intense mystery that will keep you guessing and wanting more throughout the series. There's not a bad episode in the series. You end up becoming so invested in it that you can't wait to see what happens next and you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible. The entire cast is great here but Melanie Lynskey and Christina Ricci are the real standouts here. Both were just nominated for an Emmy, as was the show itself for best drama. That's how good this is, it's being nominated for every major award their is. I'm really looking forward to Season 2 because there are still a lot of unanswered questions that need to be answered still.",/review/rw8561739/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,Nightmarelogic,8," Trauma
","This is not exactly an easy show to review which might be part of the problem. Trying to compare it to other shows would be a mistake. It is alot like ""Lord of The Flies"" and ""Alive"" but with teenage girls. However that is just a simple explanation. Basically a successful girls soccer team crash lands in the remote wilderness and are forced to learn how to survive. 25 years later the trauma the survivors face is still haunting them. Part survival epic, part psychological horror and part coming-of-age drama. Its about not dealing with your past and what happens years later when it comes back to haunt you.",/review/rw8561739/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,kevin_robbins,9," This series isn't perfect but I still loved it
",Yellowjackets (2021) is a series that I started when it first began and just recently finished. It's available on the Showtime App and Peacock. The storyline follows a high school girl's soccer team whose plane crashes in the wilderness. The series depicts both how they survived in the forest and how those events impacted their lives as adults.,/review/rw8561739/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2022,laurynl,10," Fantastically Written
","This series was just insane! I really hate when people call something ""slow"" simply because it's lacking action. Yeah, if all you want is action, then you'll probably not like the beginning of the series. Personally, I like to watch things that have intelligence to them. I find blasting nonstop action to be ""boring,"" so I guess I'm the opposite. Yellowjackets is HARDLY slow, though. I was engaged the entire time and I absolutely could not stop watching. The show is a psychological thriller, so it's supposed to keep you thinking, which the writers never fail to do. I can't wait for the second season!",/review/rw8561739/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2022,gridoon2023,7," Addictive and ambitious but flawed
","""Yellowjackets"" is addictive like a drug, very well-made, exceptionally well-acted by all, almost perfectly cast in matching the younger with the older versions of the same characters (with one exception: Juliette Lewis, whose performance is very good but I never really felt I was watching the same person as Sophie Thatcher was playing as a teen; the teen version was cooler and more positive), with some remarkably genuine portrayals of teenage girls friendships, especially between Jackie and Shauna. At the end of each episode, you immediately want to start the next one. BUT.....there is also something irritating about the way the showrunners keep stringing you along, teasing things in the Pilot that STILL haven't happened when the season ends! ""Yellowjackets"" season 1 could be described as the longest cinematic foreplay ever; the ending is disappointing as it resolves just one mystery while adding about five new ones (this tactic did not work for ""Lost"" in the long run). Also, the 1996-1997 scenes are definitely more compelling than the ""present"" storyline, though the writers do manage a shocking twist in the latter regarding the identity of the blackmailer (and Christina Ricci, especially, is fantastic). If the show had stayed more in the past and had finished a complete season arc, I might have given it an 8 or even a 9 out of 10, now it's a 7 (I probably would have cut out the two major male characters of the past as well, to give it a more unusual all-girl dynamic). Will I be watching season 2 when it comes? Sure....but in a lot more impatient mood for concrete answers and events.",/review/rw8561739/?ref_=tt_urv

31 January 2022,MovieQween-33622,6," Had potential but it let me down...
","With this cast And this premise, I really wanted to like this show. However, it just wasn't enough for me. Plot holes, lack of suspense, corny dialogue and lack of emotion. I'm not entirely sure where this premise took a nose dive for me but I can tell you I didn't feel an ounce of horror. There was so suspense on my end. It was dull and I can't believe I made it through all of these episodes. The ending was so lackluster and gave us next to no pay off. I don't know if I even care what happens in season 2 if there is one. This was lazy writing, it had such potential.",/review/rw8561739/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2021,jennfinn,10," I LOVED IT !!!!

24 January 2022,Matthew0725,7," Superb Acting, Unsatisfying End
","My real rating is a 6.5. I really like the premise of this show, and the acting is truly great, so I have no complaints there. The downside? I think this would have served better as a mini-series that wrapped up in one intense season. I don't want to have to sit through 3+ seasons to watch this story flesh out. As other reviews have said, it seems like the writers aren't sure what direction they want to take the show and which story they want to run with. Is it horror? Is it supernatural? Is it survival? Is it suspense? You get teased with supernatural elements that are quickly dropped & forgotten for several episodes, only to get a tiny tease of it again. The entire 1st season is a slow buildup that doesn't even end at the 10 minute series opening scene. The season ends with no answers as to how they suddenly decline into primal depravity, other than teases of answers. I wanted more out of an ending. All in all, I like the show, but I don't love it. I think the audience deserved more closure for a first season.",/review/rw8561739/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2021,hafaball-1,5," Horror/Suspense at a snails pace
","Imagine watching Friday the 13th... except Jason doesn't kill anyone until the 7th movie. That's, unfortunately, how I've felt watching the show so far. 6 episodes in and the mysteries are still mysterious, and what little mysteries there are I'm finding myself not caring as much as I once did after the first 2 episodes. The present parts have only been fun to watch for Christina Ricci, who does an amazing job as a friendly psychotic nurse and Aiden Stoxx, the son of Taissa, who's straight out of a Jordan Peele horror.",/review/rw8561739/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,animegamer420,3," Drags... Episode 10 should have been like episode 3 or 4
","This series has a fantastic pilot, but the rest of the series is filler. If they had consolidated all the subplots from episodes 4~9 and had the finale be the halfway point it would fix the glacial pacing and repetitious foreshadowing. This is one of those show seasons that feels like its just setup for the next season.",/review/rw8561739/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,julieshotmail,10," Oh what a perfect balance
","This show has heart, humor, horror, and it jolts you back and forth through two timelines, effectively chronicling the impact of trauma at such a young age carried through adulthood. The earlier time period shows how the structured hierarchy of a privileged, talented high school girls soccer team quickly devolves for the sake of survival in the wilderness. You care about the plight of these characters, so you are comforted to see some of them in the present-day timeline as functioning adults. However, you quickly realize that it is all a facade and that the experience has left deeper scars than any of them would care to admit. Kudos to the younger cast, as they are all solid, giving us outstanding performances. Then we get the bonus of their adult versions being portrayed by none-other-than veteran actresses, the damsels of the 90s - Juliette Lewis, Christina Ricci, Melanie Lynskey, who are a hoot together. I have not seen casting this perfect in a long time, and with an actual good storyline presented in a way that keeps you captivated, ""Yellowjackets"" without a doubt is one of the top shows to come out in 2021.",/review/rw8561739/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2022,athanasiosze,5," 5/10. Not recommended

21 March 2022,FKDZ,5," Yellowjackets
","Directing and acting are really great. Music and sound is good as well. I can see why people like the show but I think it's not working for me. Honestly I've been let down by this after seeing a bunch of hype about it. I just don't see it, the major fault of this show is the pacing, it's...so...slow. And not in a good contemplative way, but scenes of dialog that make you want to fall asleep. I'm sorry but none of the characters here are interesting nor do you want to care about them. The only parts that are actually interesting are the ones after the crash. Aside from that, I was expecting more horror and it's about 1% horror 99% mediocre drama. That's nothing to say about the acting though as that was good overall. Nitpick though but the so called ''ugly'' girl in this show is absolutely not ugly, but the show tries really hard and it simply does not work, all the scenes feel fake. I barely got through and decided not to waste my time. This would've been an interesting movie. As a show, it fails to keep my attention sadly.",/review/rw8561739/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2021,catfanatic888,8," Off to a great start! Love the premiere episode!

17 January 2022,donb-519-335075,2," Just a set up for season 2
","This show had a lot going for it - interesting story line - good flashbacks - good acting BUT it was basically a set up to make you watch season 2. The producers of The Killing learned not to do that the hard way - and I hope it is true for ""Son of Yellowjackets"" as well. I will not watch season 2 - what if they decide to string us along til Season 3? It's too bad.",/review/rw8561739/?ref_=tt_urv

","First 2 episodes. Great Great cast, performances, storyline...
I assume this is looking for an under 35 demographic . Perhaps not. I'm a young 64 yo. I'm jaded when it comes to entertainment almost to the point that I lose interest. I'm still watching TWD even though I cannot stand anything about it lately.",/review/rw8561739/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2022,NicholasMCG,5," Not as good as some reviews might say and nothing special or original
","I much prefer reading the synopsis to each episode which I did as well as watching 7 episodes. The show drags on, it is ALWAYS heavy, which is tiresome, and it's not an original concept - in fact I am surprised it hasn't been mentioned more about the original show Amazon had on literally last year where teen girls crash on an island and go all Lord of the Flies. Is this one done better than that one? They are equal in every way. I was disappointed and bored :(",/review/rw8561739/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,Likeafrisbee,10," Christina Ricci perfect to that role!
","As always Christina Ricci nailed this role! She is such a talented actress. She portrsit it so realistic with her face expressions and even bodylanguage. Juliette Lewis is also perfect to her character. I cant wait for season 2,3,4... etc! Keep it coming!",/review/rw8561739/?ref_=tt_urv
