6 June 2006,ccthemovieman-1,7," A Few Twists Make This A Fun Movie
","This was a pretty entertaining comedy with a few twists added, such as a talking gorilla, which made it fun to watch. We also see an elephant act like a dog and along the way our hero (Brendan Fraser) is a likable boob. Sometimes it's just plain stupid but that's what you get with any comedy.

30 August 1999,Budd-5,7," It's so stupid, it's hilarious!
","Thumbs up to the director and the stars of George of the Jungle. They have made one of the funniest children's films that you will ever see. You know that they had a great time making it because it's clearly evident on the screen. George of the Jungle is simply just a Tarzan parody. (Ape-man meets girl, falls for girl, leaves for city, returns to jungle). But the predictable plot doesn't destroy the performances and the movie is peppered with some laugh out loud jokes.",/review/rw4475265/?ref_=tt_urv

","Brilliant smashing comedy movie! The characters are original and fun. As if you're seeing a big family in a movie, everyone's interacting perfectly.",/review/rw4475265/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2004,DarthBill,," ""Run Shep! Run for your life!""
","Big screen adaptation of the much beloved cartoon character recounts how George (admirably played with affable density by Brendan Fraser) met his wife Ursula (played by the adorable Leslie Mann). The only thing standing between them being Ursula's mom (played by Holland Taylor), Ursula's obnoxious fiance Lyle (Thomas Haden Church) and poacher duo. Helping George is his loyal elephant/dog Shep, the toucan, and the Ape Named Ape (voiced with biting cynicism by John Cleese).",/review/rw4475265/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2000,EmperorNortonII,8," This Movie Swings!
","A lot of movies have been fashioned after cartoons, but not all of them are successful.  ""George of the Jungle"" is one of the few that score a hit in that department.  The movie captures the slapstick feel of the original cartoon.  Brendan Fraser plays his part well, as the dimwitted but lucky George.  And I can't really imagine a different voice for the ape named Ape than that of John Cleese!",/review/rw4475265/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2006,bob the moo,," Unrelentingly silly but quite fun if you get into it
","Years after a plane crash in the heart of Africa saw him separated from his parents as a baby, young George has been brought up by the animals, specifically his friend Ape (who is an ape). Many decades have gone by when George's quiet existence is interrupted by a group of explorers and their guides. When two of the party get attacked by a lion George is forced to intervene and carries the unconscious Ursula back to his tree house. As her boyfriend tries to track down the mysterious ""white ape"", George and Ursula get to know one another.",/review/rw4475265/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2020,jaredpahl,8," Exceptionally Dopey, Unusually Delightful
","George of the Jungle is a seriously goofy film. A slapstick live-action summertime cartoon aimed directly at young kids. One might be tempted to review it with bumpers; because it's for kids, give it a break. But George of the Jungle is better than that. It's a smart, witty family comedy, bursting with charm and good cheer. It may be silly, but it's a real film, with real filmmaking qualities, and a real heart.",/review/rw4475265/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2008,Woodyanders,8," A hugely enjoyable hoot
","Brendan Fraser, looking really buff and fit in a loincloth, gives an endearingly goofy performance as the lovably dim-witted and accident prone titular character, who's kind of like Tarzan's dumber and more good-natured primitive man cousin. Things seem to be going well for the extremely luck George when he encounters his first ever female human being, the spunky, pretty heiress Ursula (the adorable Leslie Mann). Alas, big problems ensue when Ursula's smug wealthy jerk fiancÃ© Lyle (a sublimely smarmy Thomas Haden Church) won't take no for an answer. Leslie's snotty mom likewise disapproves of George and when two greedy mercenaries kidnap George's best friend, an intelligent, sarcastic, bespectacled talking ape named -- what else? -- Ape (Monty Python's John Cleese supplies Ape's marvelously plummy Brit-accented voice), it's up to George to save him.",/review/rw4475265/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2006,Lady_Targaryen,6," Watch out with that tree!
","'George of the jungle'is a silly movie,but we can have some laughs. One of the reasons why the movie is worthwhile is Brendan Fraser's hot body,because in all his career I personally think this is the movie that he is in his best, physically speaking.",/review/rw4475265/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 1999,Scurfield,10," My children have never grown tired of this movie.
","This is a great family movie! My children, aged 4-8, love it and it has become one of my all time favorite live action family films. I have enjoyed watching it many times and it is a welcomed addition to our family video library. The drums beats never fail to get me in the mood for George.",/review/rw4475265/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2020,MissSimonetta,8," A masterpiece of joyful stupidity
","Words alone cannot do justice to this wonderful comedy. It's the best attempt to turn a live-action movie into a cartoon I have yet seen. The movie is very self-aware, mocking the usual tropes in these kinds of kid's movies, and Brendan Fraser is just a treasure.",/review/rw4475265/?ref_=tt_urv

1 March 2003,lgilbertom,8," George is a very funny movie
","Really, i don't understand because the rating of this movie is low. In my country, this movie bring on the theatre thousands. I give to this movie rating 8. ""George of the Jungle"" is a adaptation of the cartoon that has the same name. Really, i prefer a thousand times the movie than the cartoon. This movie it's very funny, Brendan Frasier is hilarious played George also his co-star Leslie is lovely. Also, we don't forget the George's friends, Ape and Elephant that are responsible for very good moments in this movie. There are few movies that i laugh so many times as ""George of the Jungle"".",/review/rw4475265/?ref_=tt_urv

2 December 2016,ironhorse_iv,5," George! George! George of the Jungle, friend to you and me! Indeed, he was. This movie is a guilty pleasure of mine.
","'George of the Jungle' is one fun goofball movie that most people will love. After all, the movie humor is based off the 1960's cartoon of the same name made by Jay Ward & Bill Scott, the same guys that help made 'the Rocky and Bullwinkle show'. A parody of author, Edgar Rice Burroughs's novel, 'Tarzan of the Apes'; the show and film tells a fish out of water story of an extremely clumsy and dimwitted, wild man named George (Brendan Fraser) trying to live with his wealthy love interest, Ursula (Leslie Mann) in the big city. However, the call of the wild is calling him back, to save the jungle, from some unwanted poachers wanted to capture, his friend/mentor Ape (Voiced by John Cleese). Without spoiling the movie, too much, if this plot sounds familiar, yes, it nearly a carbon copy of the plot of 'Jungle 2 Jungle', also released by Disney on the same year. Honestly, if you take away, most of clever take itself not so serious, self-aware humor from this movie, you're left with a generic somewhat cheesy tiresome plot with bad CGI, and men in badly made ape costumes. Thank goodness, the movie directed by Sam Weisman is so funny, that we can overlook that, and see it for what it is: a light-hearted parody. It's as close to being a live-action cartoon as possible. Surprising, that's a good thing since the plot is so plain. The way the movie was shot in slapstick form remind me, of the Looney Toons shorts with the Roadrunner and the Wyle E. Coyote. As the narrator explains, in this film nobody dies, but they will ""get big boo-boos"". George smashing into trees is particularly a Running Gag. Even without the dialogue jokes, the physical comedy is that universal. While, yes, the violence might led to kids accidentally hurting themselves emulating moves learned from the film, but I have to say, it's a risk worth taking, because physical comedy in a live action Disney movie has never been so funny. While, yes, there is some cringe-worthy dark moments, like apes wanting to rape the villain, Lyle (Thomas Haden Church) or a bird getting shove in somebody ass. For the most part, the childish slapstick and toilet humor, are used correctly to the point, that it's not too annoying, or offensive to watch. Surprising, most of jokes are not even that low brow. I like how the film has some wily humor to counteract the few amounts of juvenile absurdity. The way the film used cool, 'breaking the fourth wall' moments, risky sexual innuendos, exaggeration narratives, smart wordplay and puns, and some fun surrealism were great. Not only, did those jokes hit the funny bone for adults, but it was clear enough for kids to understand as well. Perhaps, that might turn off, some viewers off, but I do like comedies which the whole family can enjoy together. Also, I like how the actors delivered the jokes, throughout it. Fraser, Cleese, Mann & Thomas Haden Church gave us, some of the best facial reactions ever. I wouldn't call it, the best acting, but it was fine, for what they were given. All of the characters were pretty likable. Nevertheless, I like George the most. He's sweet, soulful, courageous, in touch with his emotions, and spends most of the movie running around in nothing, but a six pack chest and small loincloth. So, it was no surprise that most women love this movie. The title song is catchy, however, I can do, without the flashing light, title opening, after the cartoon, as it can potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. I also can do, without the fake looking locations mixed with the real-life locations. It was a bit distracting. Plus, I didn't like the whole shooting in the head gag. It probably should had been change. Better yet, have it cut like the delete scenes, where George saving Ursula from a quicksand pit, George exploring the mall and Lyle returning from jail with a shaved head and eye patch. It was not funny. It was a bit disturbing. Still, it's weird that everyone thought this movie was going to flop, but its things like what I listed, that made this movie into a box-office success and relatively well-received with critics. Even Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert love this film. Indeed, Disney presents the smash hit comedy that families everywhere went bananas over! Overall: For a movie that clearly should've been dead on arrival, it's actually very enjoyable. Kids love it, adults seem to like it, what's not to enjoy? In the end, go ahead and swing on it. It's that fun to watch. Highly recommended.",/review/rw4475265/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2001,cToTh-2,6," Even though it's a Disney movie...
","Even though it's a Disney movie and can be viewed by the whole family, the movie was quite funny.  Not Naked Gun funny, but still funny nonetheless. It is definitely worth the price of rental or purchase, so long as you like silly/unrealistic circumstances, talking animals, etc.",/review/rw4475265/?ref_=tt_urv

",How many times can you laugh at George swinging into a tree? Every single time!! I fell out of my chair laughing the first time I saw this movie and every time since.

20 February 2001,grahamsj3,," A great kiddie movie
","I can't believe I actually sat thru the whole thing. This film is silly and inane, just the sort of thing that kids will absolutely love. I found it a bit too silly. The sight gag of George hitting a tree every time he swings on a vine wears very thin after the first few times. The story is entertaining and there are a few places for an adult to find the film funny, but overall, it's definitely for kids.",/review/rw4475265/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2020,jeffgoss-91523,9," Silly but holds up since my childhood
","I watched this movie all the time as a kid and haven't seen it since I was ten. It's definitely made for kids but I understand far more of the jokes as an adult. The comedy isn't necessarily high-brow, there's a lot of slapstick humor (George falling off things, hitting trees), but if you don't take it too seriously, it's enjoyable for kids and adults especially with the 90s styles and technology dating it significantly, adding an unintended layer of humor (""Ursula, I found your scrunchie""). The bridge-swing scene still thrills me.",/review/rw4475265/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2002,Mr Parker,," Tooki Tooki!
","Laugh it up you insensitive ruffians but I actually like this movie. Yeah, it's really stupid but the film does have some semblance of charm. How can you not laugh at the ridiculousness of it all? I say, watch this movie when you're not functioning normally and you'll dig it. I don't know, I'll chalk it up to guilty pleasure. If you think I'm an idiot for digging this one, so be it. I don't mind watching someone swing face first into a tree from time to time, just to stray from the norm. Or to see a lion get clotheslined. Rating: *** out of *****.",/review/rw4475265/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2010,TheLittleSongbird,7," ""George, George, George of the Jungle, watch out for that treeee!""
","What can I say? An entertaining and fun movie. It is however a little too overlong, Thomas Haden Church is underused and some of the story leans towards the predictable side of things. However, it is very nice to look at, the scenery is colourful and the sets are splendid. Even the cinematography is very good. The music is fun and catchy, it is probably just me but after seeing this film I have had the main title song stuck in my head for days. The script is witty and quotable and the jokes are funny. And then the performances really do add to the sense of fun. Brendan Fraser gives a very likable lead performance, and Leslie Mann is appealing as Ursula. As the intellectual ape ""Ape"", John Cleese is fitfully amusing. But the star of the show is the sardonic and hilarious narration from Keith Scott. Overall, a fun and entertaining movie, not perfect, but I recommend it. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw4475265/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2018,cricketbat,8," Yes, it is silly. Yes, it is sappy. Yes, it is juvenile.
","I never really watched the George of the Jungle cartoon, but I watched this movie a lot when I was younger. Yes, it is silly. Yes, it is sappy. Yes, it is juvenile. Nevertheless, this movie is a nostalgia trip for me. I even still laugh at some of the jokes (and I still kind of have a crush on Ursula).",/review/rw4475265/?ref_=tt_urv
