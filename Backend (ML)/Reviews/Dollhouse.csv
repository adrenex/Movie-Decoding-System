26 March 2021,j-a-julian,10," I Think this is the First TV Series I've ever given a TEN
","Fantastic. Compelling. Brilliant. A complete package. Well connected episodes and a very satisfying ending. I can't say enough about Dollhouse. Eliza Dushku was amazing as she flawlessly play many characters. Fran Kranz was the anchor as he played a well developed character. I fell in love with Dichen Lachman ... beautiful, exotic, wonderful actor ... I just don't understand why her career has languished, she deserves more. Highly recommended.",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2009,Zen416,10," Kind of a shame....
","...that FOX is letting this one go. The time-slot didn't help (Friday night is usually the go-out-and-party-night) so most folks (like me) would TiVo this or DVR it for later viewing (which doesn't count to the networks, I guess). More's the pity. This show is really picking up steam and the story lines are getting better and better, especially now that the Echo, Sierra and Victor characters are being fleshed out more and given extremely interesting back stories. Eliza Dushku is a find as the tough, enigmatic protagonist of this series and since FOX isn't going to allow this cool show to go past two seasons, I sincerely hope they have the common sense to keep her on the payroll for other projects. Her chemistry with both good-guy Paul Ballard (Tahmoh Pennikett) and with brilliantly insane psycho nut-job Alpha (Alan Tudyk) is palpable and riveting. The casting of Olivia Williams as the ice queen in charge of the Dollhouse is spot on while Harry Lennix and Fran Kranz (as cool head security dude Langton and as genius programmer nerd Brink, respectively) add another dimension to the whole show. I'll continue watching this unique and entertaining series until it finally bows out a short time from now and hope that some other network may step in at the last minute and save it though that seems unlikely (again, pity). This is just a cool, pseudo sci-fi type show that probably had the misfortune of a cruddy time slot because everything else (the acting, writing, casting) was brilliant. Too bad more people didn't watch it or give it a chance.",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2009,hbabcock_28,9," Love it. Dark and thoughtful.
","This show is amazing. And dark. Very, very dark. This has clearly made many people uncomfortable. However, Helo, sorry, Paul, essentially spells out the message in the pilot: when seemingly helpful technology is created someone finds a way to use it for evil.",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2018,scubafiend,10," Brilliant
","In typical network shortsightedness, Fox cancels an INTELLIGENT program that doesn't pander to the least common denominator. Dollhouse is extremely well written, visually interesting, and consistently holds attention. Viewers who are negative clearly don't understand it. The concept is unique and well handled with a great cast. I own both seasons and wish there were more!",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2019,Tweekums,8," Another fine series from Joss Whedon
","This series is centred on Echo, a young woman who is in the 'fantasy fulfilment' business. Having committed certain offences, which are revealed later, she has been persuaded to give five years of her life to the Dollhouse. During this time her mind is wiped and she will live as a doll. When hired the required personality will be downloaded into her mind and she will fulfil that person's desires. Echo isn't the only doll, over the course of the series we get to know other dolls, who are both male and female, their handlers and key workers in the Dollhouse; notable Echo's handler Boyd Langton; Adelle DeWitt, head of the LA Dollhouse Adelle DeWitt; Laurence Dominic, her head of security; scientist Topher Brink and Doctor Claire Saunders. Outside the Dollhouse and its wealthy clients it is considered an urban legend but FBI Agent Paul Ballard believes in it and is determined to expose it; something that will put him in considerable danger. Early on we get many 'client of the week' stories but gradually the overarching plot takes over. Then we learn more about the Dollhouses and the shadowy corporation behind them.",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2022,RogerDelG,10," Over A Decade Late...

20 September 2011,Maleplatypus,10," Another work of genius
","Almost anything that Joss Whedon creates bursts with imagination, intelligence and spirit. He has that Mida's touch. Also, most of his work unfortunately gets canceled. But that's probably the destiny of genius. Since I've watched Firefly & Serenity, I've became ""fan"" (""browncoat"", so to say) of Whedon's work. Now, it is obvious that his work is not for the ""general population"", people with average (or below) IQ, which ""businessmen"" at Fox recognized canceling this one also. The ""light"" (or shall I put it - stupid) stuff brings commercials and money (which is what this ""show business"" is all about anyway), aiming at general population. Dollhouse is not for them (as it was not Firefly, for example). Anyway it's comforting to know that there are people out there (like Mr. Whedon and the crew he's been working with all these years) that ""take care"" of the needs of ""more demanding"" the viewers (although being a minority). Mr. Whedon gives us some sort of Dolls from his Dollhouse, and I'll never be able to thank him properly for that. Don't give up, Mr. Whedon.",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2013,captainbanana16,10," Phenomenal but with a few dud episodes
","This show is simply amazing. I'm not an acting expert, so I can't comment on whether they performed it well, I can only say that I was convinced. The plot was fantastic; a brilliant concept that was really well explored in places that we didn't expect, in ways that we didn't expect. Joss and his merry band of writers really knew what they were doing. There were a few episodes that I thought didn't really work, especially ones nearer the end of Season 1 and the start of Season 2 where it felt the plot was rushed, (and I expect this was simply because Joss was scared that Fox'd go all Firefly on him and stop at the first season, so he had to rush it) but they managed to 'stable it out,' and get back on track toward an amazing ending that had me in tears. The characters were all amazing, I can't think of one that I didn't like for some reason or another, and they all had more than the one standard ""He's the funny one,"" ""She's the cold one,"" personas (in fact, regarding Echo and the concept, I'm sure there's some kind of deep analysis you could do about how she parallels everybody else. But that's the English A-level in me talking.) And it totally get's you thinking! It explores what it really means to be human, and what it really means to be you, who you are, who you want to be, capitalism, personality flaws, immortality, all that stuff! Watch this show; if you can't connect with at least one of the characters or fail to be amazed at all the plot happenings, then I'm surprised if you can enjoy any show.",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2011,spuffieschilde,10," Grieved... A lot.
","How anyone can call this show boring and complete garbage is mind boggling for me. What hurts even more? Some of them claiming to be Joss Whedon's ""fan"" had actually said he lost his potential.",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2013,kingderella,8," Dollhouse is a very smart show; I love it despite it having some significant flaws.
","I love Dollhouse. It's one of the smartest, deepest sci-fi shows I've ever watched. It explores themes of identity, memory, free will, gender, and the very essence of humanity, while keeping you entertained with lots of awesome spy-fi geekery.",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2012,Afflock,10," Another amazing Joss Whedon creation

14 February 2009,Beginthebeguine,," Is this show it's Own Worse Enemy ?
","Very similar to Jason Smilovic's My Own Worse Enemy; now canceled. At first I though it might be a hit with the Tweens because there was a possible romance and some bright, flashy colors during a motorcycle race that ended in a poorly staged dance scene where Ms Dushku was all gushy in love with some guy who gives her a hearted pendant, but then the show got down to business. That business was an episode of My Own Worse Enemy not starring Christian Slater, but Eliza Dushku. Not a format for those who flock to tween movies like High School Musical 3 or read tween authors like Stephanie Myers, because there is just not enough distribution of inane characters that have no purpose in life but to strike a pose and have some deep feelings about the death of puppy love. Sure Joss Whedon takes a swipe at that dribble in the opening, but then it becomes an adult drama. So who is your audience Joss ? Is it the Buffy/Angel crowd now grown up (wasn't that Firefly ?) or are you trying to cross that threshold into the Adult Drama World. Following Smilovic's canceled show into oblivion will not help such a career move. I give it 5 out of 10 because it's Whedon, and I give it a shot for the same reason, but I doubt it will even see 9 episodes like the show it seems cloned from did.",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2012,miller-jmiller-jason,10," Genius. Absolute genius.
","This show is phenomenal. It keeps throwing curve-balls at you. Just when you have it figured out, something changes or you are surprised out of your mind. The acting stuns me constantly. As actives must change personalities frequently, the acting must do so as well. And the actors/actresses do not disappoint.",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2019,mark-532-636690,9," Way Ahead Even 10 Years Later
","See it all the Way Through To The End. Many judgements were made after only a few episodes before the plot arc was revealed. Brings both hope and terror for the future. Genius. Reminds me of the creativity of the best of Twilight Zone and Outer Limits, with a bit of Phillip K. Dick thrown in.",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2014,spuzer55,9," It tries to be its best
","I began watching this show not knowing what to expect after hearing about and reading mixed reviews stating its lack of popularity and untimely demise. I was surprised to find that every episode I watched made me want more at an exponential rate. The premise is well thought out and big on ideas. Each episode is exciting, being its own cohesive whole impressively put together with cleverly presented themes, while at the same time continuing and adding to the overarching plot development of the series. At no point in its fifty minute per episode run time does the story or dialog seem like filler or unnecessary to the plot development, and the story telling format is also often modified for extra effect and variety. The show doesn't regress into boredom or run out of ideas the longer the series continues, as some concept shows with high potential have been known to do in the past. In fact, the more you watch, the better it gets. ",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2009,UncleTantra,10," A Love Supreme
","In season one of ""Dollhouse,"" Joss Whedon (creator of the series) wrote only two of the episodes -- #1 - ""Ghost,"" and #6 - ""Man on the Street."" True-blue fans (of which I am one) tend to think that they were the two best of that season. In season two, Joss wrote episode #1 - ""Vows,"" but has remained absent as a writer until now. So along comes episode #8 - ""A Love Supreme."" If you know the works of John Coltrane, everything you need to know is in the title. ""A Love Supreme"" was Coltrane's masterwork. I suspect that ""Dollhouse"" -- short-lived as it may be -- will be regarded in the future as somewhat of a similar masterwork.",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2012,ccrunner3234,10," Why was this canceled!?
","Let me start out by saying that I don't really like most TV shows and was looking for something a bit different when I found this on online. Frankly I'm not surprised that one of the few TV shows I liked is cancelled. Dollhouse is such an intriguing series that brings up quite a few questions about humans, what is humane, and what being a human means. This series to me draws on life and being able to make free choices. Someone else wrote a review stating this series reminded them of Stepford Wives and I completely agree with them. There is an eerie and off balance feeling that the Dolls give off. Whether they realize something is wrong, whether they care, or whether they even have the capacity to care, is inconclusive.",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2019,cjonesas,8," Interesting and powerful series
","I won't be repeating what others have already skillfully put and commented about the series.
What I admire the most about the heroine of the series is her fighting skills.
She is very good at that, believe me. Unlike any other fight that you have ever seen. Watch it and rub your eyes.
As always, looking purely at the ratings, the Network decided to cancel it and leave many fans half-way and very unsatisfied.",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2015,skoobydoo6789,10," Fun, Intelligent and Amazing to Watch
","As with Firefly, I finally got around to watching Dollhouse last year. I was blown away with how awesome the show was. It's definitely one of Joss Whedon's best works along with the Avengers, Firefly, Serenity, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Angel. It became one of my favorite TV shows. Dollhouse will make you think differently about what is the human soul and if it's possible to erase the things like memories and personality that makes us human.",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2011,maniaclikeme,10," Season 1 is slow moving and subtle, season 2 really shines.
","Season 1 of this show is great. It's dark and it's powerful and it's unique and it's interesting, but it's pretty slow moving and you can find yourself wanting more. Then came the season 1 finale ""Epitaph One"", and my like of this show turned into obsession. Then came the AMAZING season 2. Every single episode in season 2 is a great one. In fact most episodes don't seem like they're from a TV show at all, they seem like short movies! The acting is phenomenal in season 2, and season 2 is just so freaking smart! Tell me the Chaucer stuff in ""Belle Chose"" wasn't brilliant, or the camera angles in that episode weren't extremely beautiful... the pair of episodes ""The Public Eye"" and ""The Left Hand"" are the most genius I've ever seen on TV! They are so edgy and provocative and kept me entertained the full way through. I can go on and on about how good season 2 is honestly! And Eliza man, Eliza!!! She holds her own with the other unbelievable actors in season 2 and even manages to outshine them on more than one occasion. Yeah she definitely proves that she is worthy of headlining her own show in season 2.",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2009,dalton0804,9," 2nd season brings on darkness and rewards fans
","As with any show ""Dollhouse"" took a bit of getting into for me. The 1st season had some amazing episodes but nothing that really jumped out and grabbed you. As a fan of Whedon's I chose to stick with hoping that he had something up his creative sleeve. Thankfully we were rewarded with the Alpha episodes of season one and the 'unaired' episode which showed us what he had planned for the future and hope against hope this amazing second season.",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2010,thebiddler-2,10," An emotional roller coaster that delves into the human soul
","To ask oneself how to review a television drama that lasted only two seasons poses many questions. The obvious: why did this show get canceled? And then the not-so-obvious: why did this show get canceled? Think of it like a double-sided coin, the probability is 100%. Eliza Dushku, or Echo, the main protagonist and co-producer of Dollhouse in interview expressed her concerns about how this might have come to be. Advertising being one, but mostly it was the Friday night time slot she recalled as ""death"" that inevitably would drag the series down.",/review/rw2274983/?ref_=tt_urv
