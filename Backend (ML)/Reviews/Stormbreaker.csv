","This is an entertaining film version of The Runaways story. I say version because there is another film on this band called ""Edgeplay,"" which complements this movie perfectly. Essentially, ""The Runaways"" is Joan Jett's and Cherie Currie's version of things. In ""Edgeplay,"" which is a documentary, the rest of the band has its say.",/review/rw2487545/?ref_=tt_urv

21 March 2010,JoeKarlosi,6," The Runaways (2010) **1/2
","I became a huge fan of Joan Jett with her first #1 single, I LOVE ROCK N ROLL, back in 1982. For years I remained a devoted follower of her albums, saw her in concert up close at small venues, and even got to meet her in person on a few occasions including getting to go backstage after a gig in 1985. It was only once she'd become popular that I discovered that she was originally in an all-girl rock band called The Runaways. Thus I found myself going back and collecting Runaways records too. So for me, this film was something to look forward to.",/review/rw2487545/?ref_=tt_urv

","On occasion, the atmosphere of watching a movie at a theater in a certain circumstance adds to the ambiance. Case in point, The Runaways: I saw it at my local cineplex, where, unbeknownst to me since I last ventured into a particular screen, the one where The Runaways played on (good old theater 8), the sound had gotten a little worse. It was crackly, though one could still hear voices and sound fx and music reasonably well, and on the side of the frames of the 2:35:1 aspect ratio, there was some black fizzle or something. For a more prestige picture or big blockbuster, it might have been a hindrance. For the case of The Runaways, it was just about perfect. This mid-1970's trip through a kick-you-in-the-ball girl rock group complimented the flaws in the stereo-sound and the picture, and it was like listening/watching a worn vinyl LP. This coupled with the attitude of the performances, and some of the songs featured, made it like a near Grindhouse event.",/review/rw2487545/?ref_=tt_urv

","THE RUNAWAYS chronicles the run of one of the most successful all-girl rock bands of all time. The film is based on ""Neon Angel"", the autobiography of the band's original lead singer Cherie Currie, and it gives us a glimpse into the world of rock and roll as seen from the perspective of a group of teenage girls on their way to super-stardom. I had heard some good things about the film when it was first making the festival circuit, but I wasn't as impressed when I finally got a chance to see it myself. The cast did an amazing job in their roles but the film wasn't as great as it probably could have been.",/review/rw2487545/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Runaways is a biographical film about the 1970s all-girl rock band of the same name. The film was written and directed by Floria Sigismondi, who based the screenplay on the book Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway by the band's original lead vocalist Cherie Currie. It stars Dakota Fanning as Currie, Kristen Stewart as guitarist and vocalist Joan Jett, and Michael Shannon plays record producer and band manager Kim Fowley.

","I really wanted to like this movie. Grew up with the Runaways, love Joan Jett & Lita Ford, was hoping for so much more. Kudos for costumes & music, not to mention Stewart nailing Joan Jett's look. But the director confuses shock value with ""deep meaning,"" and the editing leaves you with a very distorted picture of the Runaways' career. No mention of touring with the Ramones? Or the fact that they played with Van Halen, Cheap Trick, etc? I guess that's the price you pay for being based on Cherie Curie's book.",/review/rw2487545/?ref_=tt_urv

","Released in 2010, ""The Runaways"" chronicles the quick rise and fall of all-girl rock band The Runaways who released four albums from 1976-1978. I mean ""girl"" literally since they WERE girls at the time; for instance, when the band was formed in late 1975 singer Cherie Currie just turned 16 years-old. The movie is lightly based on Currie's book Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway and therefore focuses on the friendship of Cherie (Dakota Fanning) and Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) and their relationship with their eccentric manager Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon). Riley Keough plays Cherie's ""better looking"" sister while Scout Taylor-Compton and Stella Maeve play band members Lita Ford and Sandy West.",/review/rw2487545/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've been a Runaways fan since 1976, so I had been anticipating this film for a long time. Having read Cherie Currie's book, Neon Angel, on which the film is very loosely based, I was pretty familiar with the broad outlines of the story. As with any film adaptation of a book, I knew they would leave some things out and streamline other things, and I also suspected the film wouldn't be as dark as the book, which turned out to be true.",/review/rw2487545/?ref_=tt_urv

16 March 2010,jickweez-1,10," Engrossing tale of innocence lost ... with great music!
","Just caught a special screening of The Runaways last night at the Laemmle on Sunset, and it more than exceeded expectations. The leads (Kristen Stewart, Michael Shannon and Dakota Fanning) do an admirable job playing the sullen budding rock star, whacked-out manager and reluctant front girl. At first, it looked as though Stewart was going to fall back on her woe-is-me (woe-is-us who have to suffer through it) Bella character in Twilight, but her performance as Joan Jett soon showed a shyness and vulnerability that made the role three dimensional and overall enjoyable. Shannon gives a wonderful turn as Kim Fowley, The Runaways' too-brilliant-for-his-own-good manager and has some of the best lines in the movie (my friend and I were giddy every time he opened his mouth). But the real star here is Fanning as the innocent Cherie Curie, who didn't ask to be a star but was thrust into the spotlight nevertheless. Watching her downward spiral from innocent young woman (the film opens with her getting her first period) to trying to buy a jug of vodka for breakfast is where this movie soars above others of its ilk. With her big baby blues (wow, those eyes), Fanning portrays innocence lost more effectively than any other actress I can remember. She should be considered for many awards for her performance. Did I mention those eyes?",/review/rw2487545/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2011,JimBeam49,4," Entertaining, but overall disappointing.
","Let me start by saying that I was in my early 20's when the Runaways first came on the music scene back in the mid 70's. I've enjoyed their music all these years and as a fan have always wanted to know their story. There are two movies about the Runaways, this movie ""The Runaways"" and a documentary called ""Edgeplay - A Film About The Runaways"" from 2004. Unfortunately, neither film was made with the support and cooperation of all of the band members. This film was produced by Joan Jett and is focused on her and Cheri Curry. Lita Ford and Jackie Fox didn't get on board, so in my opinion a huge part of the story isn't being told. The bio Edgeplay has the same type problem, Joan Jett didn't get on board with that project, so again, a huge part of the story is missing. The bottom line for me then is this, was the moving entertaining and worth watching. I'd say yes with some reservations. First of all this isn't a documentary by any means. A movie based on true events maybe? Well, based on Joan Jetts and Cheri Curries rendition of events that they chose to portray. I believe Joan's ego got squarely in the way of how things really were back then. Perhaps why all the members didn't participate? Also, I wasn't really impressed with Dakota Fanning's performance. I couldn't quite buy into her character portrayal. I just kept seeing Dakota, not Cherie and this was quite distracting. Maybe someday, someone will make the truly definitive biography of the band with all the legal squabbles left behind, but I doubt it. So watch both films, and you'll be getting the best representation possible of what the Runaways were and went through all those years ago. One thing is for sure, the music was great back then and still is today.",/review/rw2487545/?ref_=tt_urv

","I thought the movie was a good portrayal of Joan Jetts early days. I will give Joan all the credit in the world, she is still making music and performing to this day. What about Lita Ford ?? I mean, when I think of Joan Jett...I think of ""I Love Rock and Roll"" ...When I think of Lita Ford, I think of songs like ""Kiss me Deadly"" & ""Close My Eyes Forever"" which were both huge hits in the 80's. The movie hardly mentioned her. The Movie did not even mention her at the the end when it was giving the updates on where Joan, Sherie & Kim...I think Lita should of at least been mentioned...she is still considered by many to be the Queen of Metal still to this day.",/review/rw2487545/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2011,moonspinner55,5," The Jailbait Chronicles...great attention to the visual detail, but the narrative drifts and then splinters
","Five teenage girls living in and around Hollywood in 1975 form a hard rock band which is fueled by sexual exploitation and driven to exhaustion by an adult manager with a talent for salacious promotion. Director-screenwriter Floria Sigismondi, working from Runaways vocalist Cherie Currie's autobiography ""Neon Angel"", does a fabulous job at recreating the look (and feel) of mid-'70s Los Angeles; from the stifling suburbs of the Valley to the street punks and dopers of the inner-city, Sigismondi's film has a visual pull and a gritty elegance that is, at once, immediate and nostalgic. Unfortunately, the time-line of events is a mess, with the band seemingly reaching international success (and finally imploding) in less than a year. The filmmakers are too concerned with getting to the cautionary aspects of this tale without giving us enough of the band's history. There was a lot of hard-hitting drama going on behind the formation and packaging of The Runaways (including distinct personality and musical differences between the real band members--Currie, Joan Jett, and Lita Ford among them), but this facile exploration of the group is mostly interested in headlines and druggy montages (which just eat up time on the clock). The costume design and art direction are spot on, and Sigismondi gets a lot of energy going in the film's early stages. However, when the band falls apart, the movie quickly follows suit. The narrative, choppy to begin with, skitters along to a wobbly conclusion; it is unsuccessful in building an emotional impact due to a basic failure in shaping and sharpening these characters. ** from ****",/review/rw2487545/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2010,mcw6957,6," Jailbait Jackpot
",Like most good rock biopics The Runaways thrust the audience into the artists shoes by giving you a first person account of their rise & fall. Sometimes its two members of the band who burned the brightest like Lennon & Mccartney.Often it is one like Morrison or Wilson. Well this generation Twilight version hones in on Jett & Cherie played by Dakota Fanning & Kristen Stewart. Stewart steals the show as Jett & Fanning moves ever so closer to becoming a legitimate actor. I cant say that im a huge fan of the band only that I went to see this purely to be entertained & that I was. Until the last 1/2 when it felt like they had to wrap it all up neat & quick.Something feels missing like they just jumped ahead too suddenly too fast. Michael Shannon as Kim Foley is right on par with Stewart. Then again I've yet to see him in something where I didn't like his performance. Floria Sigismondi is better known for her surreal & abstract videos & photography.Being that this is her first movie i'd say she did an exceptional job. I will be looking forward to see what she does next.,/review/rw2487545/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2010,airguitarprincess,8," Artistic but in a good way
","SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! I saw this movie in January at a Sundance event in Madison Wisconsin with Cherie Currie actually in attendance. There's a lot of two things in The Runaways, drugs and sexual references but really what can you expect from a movie about a 70s rock band. For those of you who have read the script in advance only small details change for instance Joan doesn't actually steal the leather jacket in the beginning nothing bigger then that really. The music is amazing of course even if you're not a Runaways fan it's a pretty catchy and weaves itself easily into the story line. You don't see even a glimpse of Bella in Kristen's portrayal of Joan Jett, having seen Joan Jett live, Kristen really captured her essence. Dakota Fanning was noticeably a better actress then Kristen Stewart, Dakota was Cherie and stole the show hands down. When the real Cherie Currie did a Q and A after the movie was over I got to see just how perfectly Dakota mastered even her personality. The movie it did drag at parts but the highlights definitely made up for it. The scene where Joan walks out of her first guitar lesson and Cherie at the talent show are two of my favourite movie moments. I don't know the actual filming lingo for the artistic angels and blurriness for the lack of a better word but it was all used very effectively creating an artistic feel not just another high budget Hollywood film. This movie may bring up a lot of questions about Cherie and Joan's possible romantic relationship during their time in the Runaways but when asked at the Q and A Cherie said it was nothing more than friends experimenting. To address the debate over the whole Kristen Stewart-Twilight audience this movie will attract all I can say as a Twilight fan who was a Runaways fan before Twilight was invented, I think some of the content in the movie will disturb the stereotypical Twilight fan. There's a lot of drug and sexual references made that I think a younger audience like that might not understand for instance Cherie masturbating in the shower to images of Farrha Fawcett (behind a shower curtain of course) or I believe it was Joan pissing on a guitar. Overall it's a good movie not my favourite but still solid, some parts dragged but with all the star power, great music, a pretty crazy story and a lot of heart I think this movie has the potential to top the box office in March.",/review/rw2487545/?ref_=tt_urv

21 July 2010,estebangonzalez10,9," Here Comes the Cherry Bomb
","The Runaways is a biopic about the first all-girl rock band from the 70's with Cherie Currie as the lead singer and Joan Jett as the second voice and guitarist. The movie is directed by Floria Sigismondi, who is mostly known for directing music videos. Floria also adapted the screenplay for this film from Cherie Currie's autobiographical book Neon Angel: The Cherrie Currie Story. What makes this an interesting movie is that Joan Jett actually produced this film so we have both views from the main stars of The Runaways that paved the way for other female rock bands in the future. I really enjoyed this biopic and found it one of the most entertaining films of the year so far thanks to a good screenplay and some great performances from the entire cast. The music in the film is also great and Dakota Fanning surprised me with her good vocals. I was not familiar with The Runaways before watching this movie, but I did recognize some of their songs. Cherie Currie might have received all the praise during those early years, but who later rose to fame was Joan Jett, and anyone familiar with the rock industry has heard of her. This is the story of the band she first played for before reaching true fame with Joan Jett and the Blackhearts. Whether you enjoy rock music or you don't the movie still is worth your time because it has some great performances and is really well produced, and I guarantee you that by the end of the film you will want to read more about their story.",/review/rw2487545/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2010,zadkine,10," Still running
","I've read sentences longer than the scenes in this movie. It starts off at a sprint and keeps going and going and going. It's all about hair, shoes, uppers and downers, teenage angst, loneliness and heartache, and it all feels true. Rather than father hatred there's father longing, the sex is raw but not exploitative, and the performances are sensational. Riley Keough (Cherie's sister) and Michael Shannon are terrific, and Tatum O'Neal nails the very small role of Cherie's mother. ""It seems that two qualities are necessary if a great artist is to remain creative to the end of a long life; he must on the one hand retain an abnormally keen awareness of life, must always demand the impossible and when he cannot have it, must despair. The burden of the mystery must be with him day and night. He must be shaken by the naked truths that will not be comforted. This divine discontent, this disequilibrium, this state of inner tension is the source of artistic energy."" That was written about Goethe a long time ago, and could be written about Joan Jett today.
