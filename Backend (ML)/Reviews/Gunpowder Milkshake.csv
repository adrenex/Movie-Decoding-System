9 November 2008,aharmas,10," One of the best cinema offered in 2008
","Danny Boyle has come up with some interesting cinema, certainly defining himself as someone above average. What he achieves in ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is transcend the line between inspiration and a miracle, awakening an emotional connection to the very special element great cinema can deliver. The packages might have changed, and the contents are more controversial and maybe a bit more tied to reality, certainly taking us to an exotic local, teaching us that our world extends beyond our freeway and limited perception of how more than the other half of the world's population has to deal without certainly preaching to us.",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2009,tieman64,," It is written?
","Jamal, Salim and Latika, three abnormally cute little kids, live in the Dharavi slums of India. Jamal is a dreamer, proud of his signed photograph of Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan. Salim's a pragmatist. He sells Jamal's picture - the photo epitomizing Jamal's fantasies of upward mobility - for money. Latika sits between them. She's the female trophy who exists to either be corrupted by Salim or saved from the slums by Jamal's undying love.",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2009,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," What I'm feeling for this film isn't love, it's pure admiration
","Slumdog Millionaire, the best film of 2008 by far, I saw this back in December after hearing a little bit about it on the net. I was so excited to see that it was playing at my local theater and I didn't hesitate to see it when it was released. There are a lot of people who are just asking why this film is so popular or loved, the reason why in my opinion is that it's just a happy film. We usually have a best picture winner that is depressing, but instead Slumdog Millionaire just lifts your spirits and makes you cry in joy. I couldn't believe how much I loved this film, after reading a summary on what it was about, I was just confused and wondering if this film was really going to be good. But we have these unknown young actors: Dev Peitel, Freida Pinto and Madhur Mittal who pull in heart wrenching performances and you can't help but love their characters and just keep rooting for them. All in all, this film is a love story. Most film lovers fear those words after Titanic because everyone thought it to be a predictable puppy love story, this love story however is made in strength and faith and you can't help but keep wanting Jamal and Latika to be together. Even though I saw the film a while back, I still remember it like I saw it yesterday.",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2009,bob the moo,," An energetic, stylish and engaging fairytale that has enough about it to cover the main weaknesses it has while you are watching
","This film came to the UK on a wave of Oscar hype and critical praise and I was looking forward to see it even though the reasons ""why"" it was good seemed a bit vague to me. On one hand it seems to be set in the gritty poverty of India, with descriptions of some very unpleasant scenes but then, on the other hand it was described as being uplifting and the feel-good movie of the year. I was curious how this conflicting information resolves itself within one film without off-balancing it.",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2008,ametaphysicalshark,," A crowd-pleasing masterpiece?
","The editing, digital cinematography, and Danny Boyle's direction (with co-director Loveleen Tandan) create a fascinating aesthetic which is perfect for the material. However, barely anyone (among the vast minority of people and critics who didn't care for this massively acclaimed film) is complaining about the film's technical virtues however, so how about all that contrived, sappy melodrama?

22 December 2008,Movie_Muse_Reviews,9," ""Slumdog"" beautifully bridges life in India and Western film
","It doesn't seem like a stretch to suggest that America might now be ready to embrace films in the style of India's Bollywood films. While ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is far from a Bollywood tragic love story filled with singing and dancing, the way director Danny Boyle will rivet audiences with his film that is authentic to Indian culture while using a distinctly Western style of film-making might be enough proof that there is a profit to be made here.",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2008,anhedonia,10," A stunning achievement: The best film of the year and one of the most exhilarating film-going experiences
","I won't see a better, more exhilarating movie this year than Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire."" If Academy voters have any sense, they will nominate this for Best Picture and Best Director and then vote overwhelmingly for it for both awards.",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2008,vince_cadena,10," One of the best films of the year
","Danny Boyle has been a favorite of mine since I saw Shallow Grave, since then he's gone on to make three masterpieces(Trainspotting,28 Days Later and Millions), a near perfect film(Sunshine) a guilty pleasure(The Beach) and a total miss(A Life Less Ordinary). Slumdog Millionaire comes out of nowhere and it could very well be his best film and one of the best films of the decade. Visually like Boyles previous work it's stunning, Apocalypse Now and City of God come to mind and there are dutch angles galore. The raw style mixed with the amazing locations make this film one of the most cinematic experiences you'll ever see. The Sound is perfect, I haven't heard audio like this in a while. This film needs a Sound Oscar nomination, it sounds that good. I went into seeing this knowing very little about it and the person I took with me didn't know anything about it, so I'll just say it's about a young man that goes on Indias Who Wants to be a Millionaire, it's a very unconventional film where they tell the story of his life in flashbacks while he plays the game. It's funny, sad, thrilling, basically a very enjoyable film that deserves numerous Oscar nominations. Also the lead actress is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen, if she isn't a huge star after this I'd be extremely surprised. If the academy doesn't honor this film with numerous nominations it will be a shame but this film will be studied in 20 years and whoever sees this will love it, so even if it doesn't get a single nomination it won't matter. Don't miss this film, it's perfect!",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2008,evanston_dad,6," The Final Answer Is: Fake
","""Slumdog Millionaire"" is the kind of film that many people will probably rabidly adore, because it's energetic, invigorating and, at first glance at least, feels like something we haven't seen before. But a whole other group of movie goers may find themselves resistant to its questionable charms, as I did. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a fake. An accomplished fake, to be sure, but a fake nonetheless.",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv

30 January 2009,alexkolokotronis,7," City of God Has One Vital Thing Slumdog Millionaire Does Not
","Slumdog Millionaire is one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2008 but the hype surrounding it is a bit undeserved. Don't get me wrong, this is at the very least a good movie and is quite a terrific movie 2/3 the way through. What the movie does though in the last 1/3 is make the fatal mistake of turning into a Hollywood or maybe in this case a Bollywood movie. It takes away from that genuine and satisfying feeling.

2 February 2009,tedg,," Slum Dogma
","Bless us all, Danny Boyle is in his prime. His ""Sunshine"" was lifeatleringly effective for me. He does things with a camera that are new, effective. He does better than others in providing a story foundation that fits the cinematic effects. He's visually clever. Its all more than enough for me.",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2008,katiemeyer1979,9," Just What The Doctor Ordered
","An exhilarating realistic fairy tale that will make you feel like flying. I certainly felt it. Rewarding without being opportunistic. This tale of two orphan brothers in a slum of Bombay is a mixture of heart wrenching and uplifting emotions. I didn't know anything about the film other that what I just mentioned and that was part of the enjoyment so I won't talk about the film to allow you the same discovery I went through. Let me just say that this is Danny Boyle's best film and the cast of unknowns is truly extraordinary. The last few minutes of the film will have you on the edge of your seat hoping against hope that what ""is written"" is really written.",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2009,ccthemovieman-1,8," Deserved The Oscar For Cinematography
","I thought the best part of this movie was the photography. Check this film out on Blu-Ray, if you have the opportunity: it's magnificent-looking. They even make slums look beautiful! I'm glad it won the Oscar for cinematography. Scene after scene is gorgeous.",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2009,johnleemk,10," A modern fairy tale...for the ages
","I had heard some grumbling about this movie being overrated, and until about halfway through the movie, despite enjoying myself, I was willing to give it maybe 9 stars out of 10. But then it became more than the story of a couple of kids from the slums - it became a great retelling of two ancient stories: the kid from humble beginnings who makes history, and the boy who gets the girl, loses the girl, and...well, let's not spoil it, shall we? The second half, as we see the protagonists mature, combined with the climactic finale of the game show, is easily one of the best pieces of film I have ever seen in my life.",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2008,R4J4P,9," The little movie that will wow audiences this year
","There has already been some talk coming from Telluride that this film is set to be this year's 'Juno.' It does have the same distributor and it is set for the same release period, and for anyone who hears this buzz, they will definitely not be disappointed.",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv

18 October 2017,classicsoncall,7," ""When somebody asks me a question I tell them the answer.""
","A lot of buzz when this film came out, both from movie goers and the industry itself. Since I'm usually well behind the curve on pictures like this, my reaction today with almost a decade gone by is that I don't see what the fuss was all about. It may have been a good old fashioned rags to riches story, but it was a contrived rags to riches story. One expects the kind of coincidence needed to carry a story forward in films of the Forties, Fifties or Sixties, but this was 2008, and seemed to require some lazy writing to pull off. To wit, each and every question that Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) was presented, there was some association with it during his past life. I won't deny that there may be occasional times when some element of cosmic serendipity enters one's life but the repetition that took place here defied the laws of probability. And the idea that Jamal would actually be hauled off and tortured by authorities because they thought he cheated, well I don't know, that seemed brutally excessive, don't you think? I think the game show moderator, if he felt that his popularity was being challenged by the chai wallah whiz kid, could have fixed the show's questions with ones that no one could have possibly answered. Heck, I got half of them myself with a lucky guess or two, same as Jamal. Well, you just never know. Best Picture with four additional Oscar Wins? Good deal if you can pull it off, but I just don't see it.",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2009,CineCritic2517,1," Krusty presents: The Cheesy and Schmaltzy Show.
","Since it received no less than 8 Oscars, I foresaw that Slumdog would not be of my liking, but I was frankly still baffled that the picture did not even meet my poorest of expectations, turning out to be just another overcheesed melodrama and an altogether quixotic mess of a film.",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2008,jackhajduk,10," WOW is right
","I also saw this film at to Toronto Film Festival. The audience gave it  a well deserved standing ovation. This story is told seamlessly. The  revealing look into the Mumbai slum is just one of the beautiful and  terrifying story lines. The use of flashbacks to tell the story took  you on a journey in time and culture. They used three sets of actors of  three different ages to move the story. The use of the youngest actors  (actually slum kids from Mumbai) stole the show. These kids were  incredible showing both the beauty and the horrors of growing up in Bombay. And that's not to take away from the amazing  performances of Freida, Dev, and the actor playing the older Saleem.  There performances moved many to tears. See this movie it won't  disappoint!",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2008,J_Trex,9," ""City of God"" with less blood
","This is a story set in the slums of Mumbai, about two orphaned brothers who grow up on the streets. Like ""City of God"" (set in the slums of Rio De Janeiro), one of the boys is good (Jamal) and one is bad (Salim). They both love the same woman (Latika). Each brother watches out for each other as they grow up, but it's clear that Salim is a ruthlessly violent character.",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2008,JABKool,10," One of the top 5 movies of this year
","I just saw this at the Savannah Film Festival (on Friday October 31st, 2008), held by the Savannah College Of Art and Design (SCAD) and as soon as the credits started rolling for this movie the first word that came out of my mouth was ""WOW!!!"" This movie is easily one of the best of 2008, I honestly don't know how the people have given this movie a average rating of 7 here on IMDb. This movie is the heart wrenching tale of a person who has everything he ever loved taken away from him, only to try with everything that he has to regain his true love and gain more than he could ever hope. It is preformed and put together in such a way that it forgets and bypasses every love story cliché. The movie starts out a little confusing but is very quickly sorted out and understood. Danny Boyle has made a film that inspires and encourages people of all ages.",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2010,planktonrules,9," Not quite up to all the hype and perhaps not for everyone...
","With eight Oscar wins (including one for Best Picture), you can't help but assume this will be one of the best films ever made. Well, although it is very good, it's hard for ANY film to live up to this much hype I was a bit disappointed as a result.",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2009,jon.h.ochiai,10," It's About the Girl
","Young Jamal (Dev Patel) is a contestant on the verge of winning 20 million rupees on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" How it is it possible that orphaned ""slumdog"" Jamal can answer all the questions so far, when so many others have failed? Sergeant Srinivas (stalwart Saurabh Shukla) would also like to know, in his interrogation of suspected cheat Jamal. I had heard about much of the storyline of Director Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" prior to finally seeing it. The ""Millionaire"" game show plot device initially on the surface seems contrived, as a way for Writer Simon Beaufoy to explore the story of Jamal through a series of riveting and captivating flashbacks.",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2008,slseel,8," Must-See
","This is an extraordinary film. From the original concept of the novel on which it is based (Q&A by Vikas Swarup), the screenplay by Simon Beaufoy (Full Monty) but especially the masterful creation and direction of the film by Danny Boyle. From the opening moments until the final scene, the audience was fully engaged. I was completely lost in the world that Danny Boyle created. This is not a story that has been told and retold, hashed and rehashed. It is fresh and engaging - all at once quickly moving, romantic, violent, culturally insightful, desperate and slightly fantastic. There are some comic elements to the film but to describe it as a ""comedy"" seems inappropriate. The film was shot on location in India, mostly in Mumbai. Slumdog Millionaire is yet another testament to depth and range of Boyle's artistic talent who has directed such diverse films as Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, 28 Days Later and Sunshine.",/review/rw1939058/?ref_=tt_urv
