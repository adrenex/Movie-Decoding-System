10 July 2020,charleski2000,9," A great procedural movie, and a great tribute
","This is a movie about the procedure of command. This is an innately more complex task than the more common episodic approach that buries the procedural reality under a mask of plot and character. But this film pulls it off, largely by not shying away from the task.",/review/rw5900862/?ref_=tt_urv

17 July 2020,SnoopyStyle,8," He is the Captain Now
","During the early American involvement in WWII, the ""Black Pit"" refers to the Mid-Atlantic gap where Allied convoys are left without air cover. They are at the mercy of the German submarine wolfpack. Commander Ernest Krause (Tom Hanks) captains the American destroyer USS Keeling, codenamed Greyhound, on his first convoy leading three other warships and many slow moving transport ships.",/review/rw5900862/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2022,arthur_tafero,7," Worthy WW 2 Navy Saga - Greyhound
","Tom Hanks is like a fine wine; he gets better with age. He was very entertaining when he started out several years ago, and now he is as good as any actor in Hollywood. And now, he is also an accomplished screenwriter. He did a great job with this one, and I look forward to his next work. Greyhound is about a convoy vs a wolfpack of German subs. Simple story; complex features. The cinematography and pacing is first-rate. Thankfully, the film is not bogged down by romantic devices often found in WW2 films; it is strictly meat and potatoes warfare. Don't miss this one, and don't forget the sacrifices that generation made for us.",/review/rw5900862/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2020,quidam-brujah,8," All action and subtle character development
","Funny... reading the other reviews is what encouraged me to write mine. Most of the low scoring reviews complain about poor character development or thin plot lines. We've had 80 years of movies giving us lots of historical detail, real or imaginary characters development and simple or convoluted plot lines from the World War II era. This movie didn't really need a lot of that to tell the story it was trying to tell. If you're paying attention, you can see the characters develop as the story is told. You can see the scared people gather their courage, the dedicated and loyal people that ""take one for the team,"" and the dedicated captain who will change out of his service shoes bloodied from days of constant wear into the slippers that his girl friend gave him as a gift.",/review/rw5900862/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2020,fricketesc,9," Deja-vu for a 92 year old destroyer officer!
",I served on a destroyer during the Korean War. This movie really captured the excitement of being on the bridge during convoy duty.,/review/rw5900862/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2020,rodpevoto,9," Intense, compressed, brief...
","Having served in the Cold War on both a destroyer and on a submarine, I found this story contrasting the tensions between both worlds. The action is shown from the bridge, CIC, and decks of the Greyhound, which BTW is the slang term for destroyers and those who serve on them. Hanks subtly conveys the ache of leaving a loved one behind and her presence with him during the battle. He and his crew feel the presence of the subs stalking the surface ships and the deaths of sailors both above and below the icy water. There is no perfect rendering of combat in film, but the repeated commands and protocols between naval personnel and vessels are accurate enough to convey a sense of proper urgency to the story. Compressing roughly 48 tense hours into a ~2 hour film doesn't give much time to absorb all that's happening, and that's the point. Training and subsequent reactions shape the story in the faces of the bridge crew as they watch the captain and follow his orders which he does not explain. This is about relationships between combatants, among the ships in the convoy, and between U.S. and British allies. This film, The Enemy Below, and Das Boot make a reasonable trilogy for a weekend marathon. Enjoy this story from either a technical or a relational view as you see fit.",/review/rw5900862/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2020,Draysan-Jennings,8," Loved it!
","Great film. I wouldn't necessarily call it a submarine film, but wow that was awesome. Great action sequences and CG. Definitely a pleasant surprise. Wish I could of watched this film on the big screen. Two thumbs up for me üëçüëç",/review/rw5900862/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2021,kagey-28769,8," Gets straight to the point !!
","Not sure why there's so much criticism. This was a thoughtful showing of what must have been a terrifying time for all the crews in the Atlantic
It gave us nothing more than getting straight to the point kill or be killed in 24 hrs and to think the reality would have gone on for weeks .
I thought the effects were great and the realism worked well , really saw what a cold , wet and very hostile place and they were stuck in a very cramped tin tub without a break .
Because it was only about a day then the film is kept very short , especially compared to most nowadays.
Just watch and enjoy and thank it will never be like that for any of us",/review/rw5900862/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2020,lsmuller7679,9," Great movie
","Finally a movie that isn't conventional. We don't have to have character dev. This is a movie about war. If you need a backstory, learn some freaking history because it's pathetic how dumb Americans have gotten when it comes to history. The war in the Atlantic was very long and would be hard to make a movie out of it. How this movie is done, shows how the captains and crew would hunt and destroy Nazi u boats in that era. I'm glad the movie wasn't over 2 hrs like everything else in today's time. If you want to learn what it was like crossing the Atlantic during WW2, this movie is for you. If not, then yea I guess you'll say it's missed potential. I'd have to disagree, though",/review/rw5900862/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2020,dsk-917-14713,7," Entertaining movie without over doing it
","Spectacle? Dramatization? No. This movie allowed me to experience ww2 naval combat without the bombast of the usual action movie. It felt realistic with a decent amount of suspense, a glimpse through the eyes of the captain.",/review/rw5900862/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2020,leftbanker-1,6," Wanted to Like This More than I Did
","It was just OK which is reflected in my 6 star rating, which I think is generous. They made little effort at any sort of character development. Hanks has some sort of love interest that is hinted at, but that's it. I thought they were going to build some sort of bond between the captain and his Black cook, but that never got off the ground. We know almost nothing more about the man at the end than in the beginning.",/review/rw5900862/?ref_=tt_urv

","In the World War II, the rookie American Captain Ernest Krause (Tom Hanks) is assigned in his debut to escort thirty-seven (37) Allied ships through the Atlantic to Liverpool on board of the destroyer Greyhound and commanding two other destroyers and one corvette. When they reach a spot out of the range of the air cover, they are successively attacked by German U-Boats along the next days and nights.

19 July 2020,Zaffy-1,5," Good reenactment of a WWII sea battle, but nothing else really
","Good production, quite intense, very interesting reenactment of a battle at sea, although I am not sure how realistic and accurate it is (those submarines liked to fight a lot in plain sight over the water, right?).",/review/rw5900862/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2020,thor2029,8," An excellent naval war movie
","If we start by looking at all the flaws before reviewing a movie, of course other than the masterpieces, we wouldn't like much. So, you have to put things in perspective with the movies that you liked first and that for many positive things that you took away from them, then comes your criticism from the heart: I liked, liked, adored or not liked or hated, there, your score will be subjective and therefore personal. Just a little clarification. Personally, I really liked this war film in connection with one of the episodes of the famous Battle of the Atlantic which was: the longest battle in history, starting on September 3, 1939 and ending on May 8, 1945. Just for information. It is still a very beneficial movie with very beautiful naval combat scenes, it is already a long time since I had felt this for a recent war movie of the genre (must be specified), I spent a excellent moment of cinema (TV) and which is above all the basis of the positive things to appreciate all the beautiful things which the cinema offers us. In addition here the charisma of Tom Hanks and his excellent interpretation gave a plus to the film (yes, as already said, I am a big fan of Tom Hanks) even without it I found this movie well done and entertaining, so 8/10 is a minimum rating for me.",/review/rw5900862/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2020,tccandler,3," Dull Thud...
","One of my most anticipated 2020 films lands with a dull thud. Excluding credits, this movie is 78 minutes long... and 75 of those minutes are spent listening to Hanks scream orders like, ""Left Full Rudder! Bearing Two Niner Zero! Hard to Starboard!"" There is zero character development... and Elisabeth Shue (who gets second billing) has exactly 15 seconds of screen-time. What a disappointment.",/review/rw5900862/?ref_=tt_urv

15 August 2021,cjonesas,9," [8.7] Simply yet dramatically depicted
","A great and very enjoyable movie full of very good acting, emotion and thrill. Had it not been for the too loud dramatic music over voices, a little unsuspenseful flow and some artificial/unrealistic felt momentum, especially in the Wolf taunting and canons shooting like ""plastic"" shells, it'd been greater.",/review/rw5900862/?ref_=tt_urv

","Great movie. It was 90 minutes long and it stuck to the main plot throughout the movie. It was intense, it was gripping, it was emotional and it taught me about an important aspect of WWII in the most exciting way possible. I appreciate how the movie jumps right into it without too much building up to the action sequences. Amazing special effects.
