31 July 2022,annette-87536,7," Ok but the music....
","I enjoyed this movie even tho it was a bit predictable. Very good story, the music was great BUT her singing was annoying! I could only understand 1/2 the words. Stop trying to be so breathy. Just sing.",/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2022,wahlers83,1," Veteran here...
","This is like a bad hallmark movie... As a veteran myself and someone who reviews veteran's military discharges everyday I can 100% tell you that the main character would not get a bad conduct discharge for this. He is married. It doesn't matter what his intentions were, as long as he is married he is entitled to the benefits that come with it and so is she. The idea that this movie even exists bothers me to no end. Completely inaccurate on multiple levels.",/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,JonnyDR75,7," Luke Warm
","Nicholas Galitzine is excellent in every movie I've seen of his, but I feel like he's never gotten the right role in the right movie at the right time to propel him to the proper level of success and status which he deserves. I don't want to get into the negative opinions I have about this movie. I think its flaws are apparent, and I don't think it's necessary to drag down the hard work everyone clearly did. I just wish Nicholas was given a meatier role in a A-list project, so more people could appreciate his talent.",/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,teiixeiral,5," A shallow, escapist romance.
",Purple Hearts is messy. The political and socialist commentary that the film starts off with is dropped half way through for a romance story that's unrealistic given the differences between both characters established at the beginning of the movie.,/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,jldivelbiss,7," Good, dramatic, cheesy slice of love
","This was pretty darn good. It's definitely a romantic, fictional-based story in every sense of the imagination but still oh so cheesy good! A must watch for the hopeless romantic who wishes to stay hopeless in reality but hopeful in fictional love storylines.",/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2022,randyunseen,3," I wanted to like this movie
",I really wanted to like this movie. The chemistry was off in all scenes. The singing was horrible especially the opening song. A little to political for me and not very believable... This movie just didn't work...,/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,rynrox,5," Pretty Cringey
","I wanted to like it, was hoping to enjoy it as a lighthearted cheesy romance - but I could not sit through any more cringey liberal and conservative stereotypes. No one talks like this. It was painful to watch and a little too clich√© for my liking.",/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,pigues,9," Actually, better than expected
","Ok it might be predictable but the development of the characters is slow and realistic, and you witness how they end up caring deeply for one another.",/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,Manly1947,9," Completely blindsided
","Didn't know the actors. (I'm Australian, cut me some slack)
Sounded like a dud rom-com.",/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,TharsheyN,10," Predictable But Beautiful!
","To start this review off I will say that yes the ending was predictable, along with a lot of what I knew would happen; Like them getting caught, realizing they've actually fallen in love over the course of the movie and having a happy ending after all is said and done.",/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,jpcjcpd,3," Cute and had potential.......but Netflix
","It seems like whomever wrote this knows nothing about how the military works (from deployments, to advance pay, credit unions, etc.). It's the typical tropes that are meant to add to the story but become a distraction.",/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,blebbe,7," Surprisingly good
","I didn't have high expectations for this, but I ended up actually kind of enjoying it. The story itself is sweet, I liked the tension between the main characters. The acting was great and the pacing was pretty good too. It was a little predictable, but nothing too bad.",/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,t-d-t-m82,5," Tedious Straight-To-Netflix Movie
",An unrealistic plot-line which was made-up in five minutes. An obsession with her 'career' being successful as an recording artist but it never really making sense.,/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,soumyabratamajumder25,7," FAITHFUL ATTEMPT TO NICHOLAS SPARKS REVIAL
",Yes I had to bring up Nicholas Sparks coz if anyone remembers Nicholas Sparks's Rom-coms were a genre of their own and this movie reminded me exactly of those movies which we all love to see in a weekend but hate to admit. What I liked about this movie is that it knows that it is a feel good rom-com and it is committed to it. I felt good because it turned out better than I expected it to be. Bonus for using that dreamy sunlight glow filter in the movie which made it look like an actual movie not like a TV movie.,/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,skpn123,10," What a lovely quirky surprise - Stunning
","A story about redemption and finding light in each other, in the total differences. Love in the fire of growth and change. This film has so much heart, chemistry, and genuine feeling I was totally mesmerised and any faults just melted away. I cannot tell you one and encourage you not to look for them, rather be swept up in the ride........ Sofia Carson and Nicholas Galitzine are stunning together and the whole cast is memorable. I will look for these actors from hereon.....",/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,fersiaf,9," I don't get the bad rating for this movie.
","There is too much hate in the world already and give this romantic movie a break y'all. First, why be so critical on a romantic movie? I just don't get it. The movie is like a breather especially when you have seen a lot of serious movies or series. Appreciate the simplicity and immense yourself into something that somehow would allow yourself to escape reality. Who wouldn't like to have a love story like theirs? This movie tells us how great it is to have someone who really loves us and I guess the poor critiques are all so bitter enough that they fail to see the beauty of falling in love or they are too serious with their lives having no time for some love.",/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,deesirius,5," The singing was soo cringe...
","Im not sure why young female artist have to sing this way. I can barely understand what she is saying?? Why do they do the breathy baby crooning? Its hard to enjoy the songs. Shes not untalented, just annoying. Also am i supposed to believe these two come together after their clear stances on political views. I see what Netflix tried to do and don't know that it worked. Dont get me started on the military taking the word of a blitz out drug dealer...i literally facepalmed! But i did manage to watch the whole thing, so theres that?? Its okay for what it is.",/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,hakmajik,8," Better than it had any right to be
",Formulaic? Absolutely.,/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,sarah_sle,1," LOL!!
",More of the same crap from Netflix! Is this what my $20 a month funds?!?! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è No wonder why so many people are leaving and streaming direct from the free internet sites!,/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,reidandphyl,5," Really wanted to like this but.....
","This movie ended on a high. But to get to this point you had to watch the most insufferable female character in history. Sofia Carson's character was so incredibly selfish and unlikeable. I found myself yelling "" What a B"" too many times. The male lead was great. It just wasn't a romance movie that left you with a satisfying feeling at the end. As other viewers commented her making a wounded vet sleep on the sofa, giving him a hard time while he's trying to recover and being mad that he didn't tell her about his debt when it was her idea that they break the law to begin with. She was just gross. Her redemption at the end wasn't enough to save this character. Sofia should really stop choosing parts where she is so narcissistic. She's starting to typecast herself.",/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2022,squchan-90528,5," It was Ok but the sometimes super frustrating
","Well, I won't lie, the visuals were good, not exceptionally magical, but it was acceptable, the soundtrack, ok, the scenario, I can work with that, maybe a little rushed but I can live with it, I liked the political perspectives of both leads clashing, it was funny sometimes.",/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2022,KristinaGeorgievaBG,8," I wasn't expecting this!
","Every time I watch a romance I don't expect much. Every romantic movie has three basics. In the beginning they like each other then hate each other and finally they love each other. But this film has something different. It has something real. They show us how two people fall deeply in love. And they show it to us slowly, step by step. They didn't rush anything. Yeah it's not one of the greatest movies but the story line between them it's amazing. It was a fresh air. Something new.",/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2022,micaml,6," Enjoyable but slightly predictable weekend movie
","This movie was quite enjoyable to watch, but it had some flaws.",/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2022,Misss25,3," I was looking for chemistry the whole time
","People are praising much more than this movie and storyline actually deserves. Some of my friends literally requested me to watch this otherwise I wouldn't have. I'm so disappointment. There wasn't any character development rather martial law and bla bla. There wasn't any chemistry between two main lead. When the male lead was injured, I thought, this is time, maybe she will be gentle towards him. But, she actions was just irritating. This movie just disappointed me at every level.",/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,martin-683-192101,4," Terrible
","I gave it a chance and watched it to the end. Its very predictable all the way through. Many of the songs are old hits until she write her own songs, which isn't good. I think she is a terrible singer, which would never get a hit song in real life.",/review/rw8389884/?ref_=tt_urv
