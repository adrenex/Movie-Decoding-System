6 December 2022,ar_brierley,9," Quirky dry humour, VERY smart!!!
","Irreverent is a really well-written comedy, gentle and quirky, lots of 'in jokes' that only Aussies will get (sorry Yanks!). Colin Durrell in the lead is SO good, becoming more likeable with every episode. The supporting characters are great, with skilled actors delivering ridiculous lines with deadpan accuracy. This is SMART comedy, very witty & dry, not 'laugh out loud' stuff most of the time, even better than that (I think). I found it an absolute joy to watch, and so uplifting!! Congratulations to all those involved, we need more of this intelligent stuff to enjoy; so much of the rest is just sensationalistic hyperbole; this one is a REAL GEM!! Thanks so much for raising my spirits.",/review/rw8717352/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2022,logannugen,9," Funny show with a heart
",Stumbled on this show by accident and glad I did. I binged the whole season in one go. It's funny but has some delicate sweet heartfelt moments and some random city gangster action to keep you the story interesting.,/review/rw8717352/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2022,robd-50235,9," Slow stereotype start but gets better
","Okay I approached this with trepidation. Looked like a series trying to have more cliches than Crocodile Dundee. But surprisingly the more I got into it the less I thought of it as stereotypical Australian tv show. Yes the mob guys are a bit unrealistic, the original ex rev going Zumba is stupid, but the character development of the rest of the cast as it goes on is good and the scenery is great to watch. Worth more than the low ratings it has received. Overall it is worth a watch if looking for something to invest a bit of time in. With different characters it keeps it interesting and makes a nice change from the normal tv series.",/review/rw8717352/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,flgtrn,9," Enjoyable
","I thoroughly enjoyed this series. I found it funny, quirky with dry humor. The actors are believable and entertaining. I do see that several reviewers do not agree with me but I see several do agree that it is a great series. Some people do not appreciate witty, dry humor. And for those that don't, I am sure this show is a disappointment. I found the location and scenery beautiful which made the show even more entertaining. I am glad that Peacock took a chance on producing this somewhat unusual series because it made a weekend of binge watching fun. I am hopefully for a second season because I enjoyed the show.",/review/rw8717352/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2022,A_Different_Drummer,6," have you ever tried to mix oil and water?
","The single most important thing you need to know about this series is that it was a corporate idea. This is not merely your humble scribe talking. If you take the time to review the PR releases on the show, you will see that the producers actually boast about how a couple of corporations got together and decided to produce a comedy/drama out of Australia based on a Chicago hood who is on the run from the mob, and pretends to be a Reverend. Think ""Ozark in the Outback."" The second most important thing you need to know about the show is that the first key scene is stolen from BANSHEE. Maybe I am a little biased about that, because I have done over 2000 reviews here. And BANSHEE remains my all-time favorite series. So, I am thinking, if you are going to the trouble to steal from the very best, the result had better be worth it. And that is where we get bogged down with Irreverent. The production values are solid, the casting is good, and everyone does exactly what they are supposed to do. But at the end of the day that may not be enough. Because it is a fundamental principle of story-telling that comedy and drama do not mix well. Only a handful of creators, in the history of TV, have been able to pull that stunt off. And, respectfully, the ""corporate auteurs"" behind this show may discover they have bitten off more than they can chew. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

4 December 2022,angelaloyd,10," An enjoyable experience
","A very enjoyable show. After watching the series I find myself comparing it to the likes of Northern Exposure. He is the fish out of water with these quirky characters. Each episode introduces a new character and builds onto this whole plot and uniqness. Its true that the initial basis is similar to previous shows, but that is where it stops. The rest of the series changes from these shows we have seen before to give the series its own unique spin while throwing in those reminisces of other loved shows. A truly enjoyable show. I hope this is renewed. I want to see where the next season would be handled. Worth your time. Give it a watch.",/review/rw8717352/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2022,alicechisnall,9," Wonderful Aussie fun!
","I was looking for something to keep on in the background, but this one was a gorgeous surprise! The characters are kooky and easy to love, the story is quirky and fun, and the Australian actors are brilliant in their small town character roles. The pace is quick and the writing combines the best of antipodean humour and American family drama. I've been looking for a reason to move from New Zealand to Queensland for a nursing job, and if anything would convince me, it would be this! The tropical locations are stunning, and I'm really looking forward to the next season. Cute, off-beat fun. Definitely recommend!",/review/rw8717352/?ref_=tt_urv

13 December 2022,xyzgold,10," Watch this show!
","Irreverent took me by surprise. I didn't expect it to be that good! I don't like spoilers so didn't know almost anything before diving head-first into this Colin Donnell's-led show on Peacock. I loved him in Chicago Med and still miss him there. One other thing that was intriguing to me was the name of the show, Irreverent. Underused word, for sure. It was described as a Drama, but you will laugh most of the time. It's also heart-warming and yes, irreverent. All the time. I enjoyed the storyline, the characters are well drawn, and there is also a crime. Or two. Or more. There is a community of people who you don't think you can care about. But you will surprise yourself. Just watch!",/review/rw8717352/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2022,gandf-15728,7," Review based on first episode.
","I loved the opening scene in far north Queensland. Yes its a comedic exaggeration of reality, but it does show the beauty and the - possible - terror of that location.",/review/rw8717352/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2022,hrolf-78887,8," Far North Queensland at its most quirky.
",Follows an ensemble cast of believable eccentrics and is set in a very country part of Far North Queensland that is over four hours drive from the capital. It is a place where crocodiles are a far greater risk than sharks and cassowaries even more so.,/review/rw8717352/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 2022,tamsyn-matthews,10," Best bingeworthy show I've found this year.
","I've been incensed by reviews before when they've rated shows and movies too high or too low. Never quite enough to write my own first review though. I LOVED this series. So here goes..it has everything; great plots, characters, comedy, drama, scenery and an understated romance. I don't care who commissioned it, it's great! Sure, you can see where the story's headed in places, but it's not trying to be a suspenseful thriller with a shocking twist. Please don't be put off by other reviews. I was hooked by episode 2 and finished all 10 in a weekend. Similar dark humour to Mr Nobody and Preacher.",/review/rw8717352/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2022,davidlgraham,4," Irreverent is votrect
","Irreverent to the soul. A cliche ridden hot mess set in a town of whackos and a fool on the run. As you watch the first episode have a drink everytime you correctly predict the outcome of each cliche. You will be drunk halfway through. A bit woke. A bit sad. A lot foolish. And blah, blah blah blah. The second episode is no better. Dialogue ripped right out of every disgusting sit om ever watched. Just blithering here to get 600 words in. Pretty stupid requirement if you ask me. Elon Musk is a modern day genius. Oh, and the lead character is a baffoon and a fool. All of the characters are stock for a substandard sitcom. Fools are not funny. Quit making shows about fools.",/review/rw8717352/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2022,anttom-18263,8," Enjoyed it
","Really good show..... was unexpected and took me awhile to get to it... but just about binge watched it once I did ... entertaining, a little drama, few twists, a little funny, a little suspense .... Recommended
The show starts a little slow, but it's builds up nicely... the Australian actors do a great job, but still over do the Aussie ocher sometimes, but mostly getting better at being normal Aussies
The only thing that's annoying .... Most of the world thinks Australia is a super dangerous place
and this show makes it even more believable, even though Australia does have lots of dangerous, venomous animals ... it's still a great place to visit .. lol.",/review/rw8717352/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,Headturner11,7," And a half: Update spilers
","So far! I rarely use my Peacock app anymore because of the abundance of commercials even tho I pay extra NOT to have them! Any ways I have really run out of things and went on there and saw this. Now if it wasn't an Australian serie I wouldn't have tried it. I only got 2 and a half episodes in and the app kept closing so on like the 5th time ( this happening) I decided I will revisit it tonight. There's many actors in it I like, Wayne Blair( he's in about every Aussie series out there) , Rhys Mitchell( super funny, talented. First saw him in the fantastic Upper middle bogan. Didn't know he was behind many popular series I like) Martin Sacks ( Wentworth)!!! Wish he had a bigger part ( or perhaps he does since I've 7 episodes to go. Any ways excited to finish tonight and if needed I'll update my review.. Well I finished this last night and I must say I really did like the first 3 episodes and then it just didn't turn out like I thought it would. It seems I nw know what bad editing is. It seemed like whole parts were edited out. Martin Sacks basically shouldn't of even been in it as he dies before the even has a full scene. It seems they also went no where with the love interest either and in the end it was just a jumbled mess and ends as if there was at least one more episode but no and there probably won't be another season. So in the end I was disappointed.",/review/rw8717352/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2022,Macca50,2," Another rip-off

11 December 2022,Stephanie4040,1," Proving Australian TV is rarely funny
","This movie consists of Aussie humour that is stuck in 1980 and has the intelligence of an 8 year old boy... I guess Australians will find this funny but the rest of the world will just think it's the height of cringe. Cliches, really awful attempts at jokes that miss 99.9% of the time, and loads of cheesy church stuff that's supposed to be funny but isn't. As well as all that, the actors are crap other than Colin Donnell, Tegan Stimson and. Ed Oxenbould. The rest are shockingly bad, and is just really embarrassing to watch. It's keeping the stereotype of Australia as a blokey culture who are a bunch of idiot bogans - whether true or not, it's just not funny.",/review/rw8717352/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2023,sonrisaparatu,10," Fresh and Fun
","This is finally something worth watching. The story line is decent and overall engaging, drawing you in, making you want to watch what's next. I love the dramedy of it all. I love all of the characters of Clump - I think Cam and Daisy are my favorites. It's good to see TV bring in God - a message for us all. I love to see the softening of the main character (Mack) as he begins to be involved in all of the townspeople's lives. This little town of Clump shows a simple beach life but how drama exists in every corner of the world, but humanity and love eventually prevails. More please!

4 December 2022,yrgcc,1," Crime/Drama/Comedy/Dramedy/RomCom???? All of these but not remotely entertaining
","This show doesn't know what it is. Opening on Queensland's sunny Gold Coast where crocodiles don't actually jump out of the water and eat people, a wedding party is disrupted when the priest is eaten by a croc. This attempt at comedy is pretty appalling. It tries to capture the brilliance of iconic Australian comedy films like Muriel's Wedding but fails abysmally at that. Suddenly we jump to Chicago USA to an unoriginal ""crime mob"" scene in a parking lot where everyone dies bar one. We are left with the vague hint that the mafia man who survives will go to Australia and take over the job of the recently deceased priest. This show is really pathetic. What a waste of money and talented actors. Makes you wonder if anyone at Netflix read the script before it went into production.",/review/rw8717352/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,pruemiller-65852,1," It's dejavu all over again
","How bloody heartbreaking to see yet another local production ( sic) that curls your toes in the first five minutes. The location porn is short lived, and messed up with a $100 set 'bar', and character actors by the pound. The crook hiding as a priest has been done and and done - and each version better than this. Script is vintage Aussie soap; a touch of Seachange, a touch of Rake, a slosh of Ramsay Street. The lady copper actor is the only glimmer of positivity. A fresh face, she manages to dodge the worst of the direction. I know, without reservation, that Australia has some great screen talent... one can only assume they ran for the hills when this project was first mooted.",/review/rw8717352/?ref_=tt_urv
