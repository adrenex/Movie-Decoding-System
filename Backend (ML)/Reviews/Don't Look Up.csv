1 January 2022,siderite,9," A really good movie, yet painful to watch
","I understand why some people hate this film. It feels real in its entirety, it shows you how stupid and insignificant we are and it is extremely apropos today. Also, it was marketed as a comedy, when in fact is a dramatic film that is humorous only in its accurate portrayal of humanity. Then again some people try to ""tell you"" what it is about and, while it is certainly metaphoric, it isn't about anything more specific than ourselves. It is a mirror. Some people don't like what they see in it.",/review/rw7698482/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2022,nogodnomasters,8," We really did have everything
","This seems like a film about a comet headed to earth to destroy the planet. It is really a satire about society. It spoofs the social media and how politics and truth deniers argue about facts while killing the planet. If you look up into the sky, you will see the comet. The title in the mantra of those who believe the comet is a conspiracy. Tech industry leaders and talk show hosts are also satirized.

8 December 2021,ferguson-6,8," a look in the mirror
","Greetings again from the darkness. What happens if Chicken Little was right, and the sky really is falling? Writer-director, and Oscar winner, Adam McKay proved with THE BIG SHORT (2015) and VICE (2018) what occurs when he turns his unique commentary towards a target. Two questions remain. Is political or social satire just too easy these days? Has insanity permeated our globe to the degree that pointing out the lunacy has become ho-hum? McKay wrote the script from journalist David Sirota's story, and it's even more extreme than his previous work, and likely meant as a wake-up call to all of us.",/review/rw7698482/?ref_=tt_urv

13 December 2021,paul-allaer,8," Devastating and depressingly effective political satire
","As ""Don't Look Up"" (2021 release; 138 min.) opens, Kate Dibiasky, a PH. D. student at Michigan State, discovers a large comet that is heading for earth and bound to kill all life as we know it in 6 months and 14 days, to be exact. She and professor Randal Mindy are headed to the White House to brief President Janie Orlean but alas are informed by the President's son and Chief of Staff that the President is too busy that day. When the finally see the President the next day, they are weirdly unable to convey the urgency of the situation, and the President orders them to ""sit tight""... At this point we are 10 min.

31 December 2021,aidanratesmovies,10," The fact this film has so many negative reviews is the exact reason why something like this will definitely happen
","Scavenging through the many negative reviews of this film, I find myself incredibly against any negative thing people have to say about this one, and honestly find myself dumbfounded it isn't receiving more support from critics. This film is brilliant, and many of the negative reviews towards it only point out the stupidity of those watching it. It's quite embarrassing to say how little people understand what this film is trying to do, or instead try to focus on its style instead of what it's trying to say. This film is a brilliant political satire, a tour de force from Adam McKay entirely capitalizing his frustration with the stupidity of those in the political system and all those it effects. It's so incredibly well written in both story and character depth, focusing on the many ridiculous decisions and scandals in the political system, as well as personalizing them for each character- showcasing on their level of ridiculousness. I share deeply in the frustration this film encapsulates, and never has a film made me feel more seen and sane in my own opinion of our current world that I simply couldn't believe how well it seemed to be reading my mind. Not to mention how well made this film is, a nearly 2 and a half hour political satire, that manages to be entertaining all the way throughout as well as brilliantly acted from veterans Jennifer Lawrence, Leonardo DiCaprio, Meryl Streep, Mark Rylance, and so many more. In the end, Don't Look Up is easily one of the best films of the year for me, and might just be McKay's best film yet.",/review/rw7698482/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2022,evanston_dad,8," Much Better Than Its Metascore Would Indicate
","With a Metascore of 49 at the time of this comment's writing, I expected a much worse movie than ""Don't Look Up"" gave me. I also mostly hated both ""The Big Short"" and ""Vice,"" so I believed the Metascore would probably be reflective of my own reactions. But I always go into movies wanting to like them, so here's to keeping an open mind. You might find yourself surprised.",/review/rw7698482/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2021,Draysan-Jennings,8," Great Film.
",This is definitely one of my favorite films of 2021. I'll be surprised if it doesn't take home the Golden Globe award for best Comedy / Musical Motion Picture. Nevermind the bad reviews. The people leaving those reviews are the same people that paid $17 to watch Space Jam 2 in the theaters. I highly recommend this film. NETFLIX nailed it! 8 stars.,/review/rw7698482/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2021,paul_haakonsen,6," Well-placed jabs at the society and world today...
","Initially then I wasn't really overly hooked on watching the 2021 movie ""Don't Look Up"" since I wasn't really won over by the movie's synopsis. Granted, I hadn't checked out the movie's trailer, so I wasn't really sure what I would be in for here. But as friends started to praise the movie, I opted to sit down and watch it.",/review/rw7698482/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2021,JoBloTheMovieCritic,8," Don't Look Up
","8/10 - while there was some editing and pacing that was not 100% up my alley, I found myself finding plenty to laugh about and being more deeply affected than I expected by this well-done satire (and Ariana Grande's big screen debut) that gives you plenty to think about.",/review/rw7698482/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2021,jtindahouse,9," Smart, funny and powerful
","I had the chance to be one of the first in the world to see 'Don't Look Up' and I didn't take it up. It looked like an overly long, overly star-studded, boring mess to me. Boy, I could not have been more wrong. This film was a treat from beginning to end.",/review/rw7698482/?ref_=tt_urv

24 January 2022,classicsoncall,8," ""This is just some sort of alternate reality, right?""
","There may be some current event topics that this film doesn't parody, but off the top of my head I can't think of one. It skewers capitalism, crass commercialism, fake news, disdainful politicians, censoring opposition voices, illegal 'Chilean' immigration, the country's ideological divide, and billionaire space travel wannabes like Elon Musk and Richard Branson. There's no mistaking President Orleans' (Meryl Streep) 'Don't Look Up' baseball cap as an overt slam against a former resident of the White House. Without trying to be, (or maybe it was), the satire is often hilarious, as it examines a culture that's too wrapped up in it's cell phones and social media to care much whether the world comes to an end or not. All of the principal players are brilliant in their roles, which for me is saying a lot, as none are particular favorites of mine. Dr. Randall Mindy's (Leonardo DiCaprio) lament, which turns into a historic rant on TV, is really at the heart of the film when he asks ""How do we even talk to each other?"", highlighting what political events and a world pandemic can do to sew dissension and distrust in all directions. And yet, isn't it the purpose of film makers to put out a product that makes money and win awards? In reality, the picture mocks itself for what it is, a brutal examination of where we've come to in the twenty first century amid all the distractions to real life that can possibly be imagined.",/review/rw7698482/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2021,tygertygerburningbright,9," Well-written and witted satirical film
","I loved it from start to finish. The dark humour, the sad truth about some of our current realities, human emotions, weaknesses, ethical dilemmas, tribulations, the depth and all the meaning about existence and life along with all the details they placed in the background of every scene make it the best movie I have seen in a very long time. Music by Nicolas Britell is also a marvellous touch to the film. Absolutely brilliant!",/review/rw7698482/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2021,gielvdsteenhoven,8," Horrifyingly realistic
","Its quite likely that humanity will be faced with a calamity in the near future that will threaten our excistence as a species. Dont Look Up explores how we would deal with a comet-implosion variant, without walking on eggshells. What scared me most was that the story was, in most part, highly believable when it came to humanities deficiencies in planning short term vs long term, and gain of the individual vs gain of the collective. So much so that I need to go get a pint of icecream to eat my Weltschmertz away now.",/review/rw7698482/?ref_=tt_urv
