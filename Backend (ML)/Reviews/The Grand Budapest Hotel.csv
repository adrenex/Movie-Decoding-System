19 July 2021,ThomDerd,6," Liam Cage vs Nick Neeson.
",Not sure who is my favorite from the 2. But both seem to love the 1-man-show kind of films which have absurd and nonsensical stories.,/review/rw7064046/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2021,Calicodreamin,3," So bad
",Watching the ice road was like watching a movie in slowmo. The fight scenes were terribly coordinated and dragged out. For such a simple objective the actors spent a lot of time standing around and bumbling about. The script was poorly written and the plot was thin. Shaky science and lame CGI. A poorly made mess.,/review/rw7064046/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2021,SnoopyStyle,5," company non-sense
","American trucker Mike McCann (Liam Neeson) is struggling to care for his mechanic brother Gurty (Marcus Thomas), a former soldier with brain issues. He gets a needed job opportunity from Jim Goldenrod (Laurence Fishburne). A diamond mine in northern Manitoba has a cave-in. Needed drilling equipment is getting trucked in over the ice road despite being weeks after the driving season. The ice is thinning and the operation is full of dangers. Tantoo (Amber Midthunder) is the third driver and Tom Varnay (Benjamin Walker) is the company man joining the trip.",/review/rw7064046/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2021,just_in_case,1," Bizarrely stupid. Just strangely bad on every level.
","It's hard to describe without actually experiencing it, but the dialog in this is one of the strangest things I've ever seen. Imagine if a 5 year Chinese child wrote an entire script for a movie and then a 5 year old Finnish child with some secondhand knowledge of English translated the script and it was phoned in by actors needing a quick paycheck. There's an actual line where an adult explains to another adult what the word ""redundant"" means. Not in context or for comedy. It's just a random, serious dialog exchange in the film. I've honest to God never seen anything I could compare this to. This not ""bad"" dialog, it's almost as if the script was auto-generated by a learning computer.",/review/rw7064046/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2021,nebk,3," Ridiculous And Bad
",In The Ice Road Liam Neeson stars as a down on his luck trucker offered a large amount of money to drive one of three trucks carrying industrial machinery in order to save trapped miners who are quickly running out of air due to an explosion that trapped them in a diamond mine. The mission is sabotaged by the greedy owners of the mine who don't want evidence that they were not following safety measures and are responsible for the explosion and cave in that trapped the miners.,/review/rw7064046/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2021,random-70778,," Unbelievably bad, simply one woke cliché after another in a nonsense script
","1. The Native American woman actress entire entire identity and dialogue in the film is about being native American. Do they insult Laurence Fishburne and African American viewers by making his character all about being African American? The makers (who are not native American) are ham-fisted ""woke"" attempting to show bigotry -- yet it is their own bigotry that shows through.",/review/rw7064046/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2021,flyingmouseplus,1," REALLY BAD SCRIPT
","A script full of flaws, ridiculous situations, not believable at all. Nobody reviews these stories before financing? I couldn't even finish it, it was absurd. Poor Liam, this movie is really bad for his reputation.",/review/rw7064046/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2021,brianearley25,8," I needed a distraction and it worked
","Some people on here were obviously looking for an Oscar worthy contender. Me, I was just looking for an escape for a couple of hours. It worked. Was it brilliant? No. Was it watchable? Yes. Liam made it better than it should of been. Supporting cast was capable. Yes the CGI was off in some places, but it's Netflix not a big screen release. Watch it for what it is. It'll pass time.",/review/rw7064046/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2021,chris-h-3,2," Poor Filmmaking on every level
","I was going to say this is like a movie from the Hallmark Channel but that does the people who make those films a disservice. A combination of the direction, editing and a mediocre script manages to stamp on any possible sense of drama or suspense in this film.",/review/rw7064046/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2021,iceman88869,1," Two Great actors and a bad script
","It's obvious the production value of this movie is extremely low. With two great actors such as Liam Neeson and Laurence Fishburne, you would expect a blockbuster type movie, but that is not the case here.",/review/rw7064046/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,kosmasp,7," Thin Ice/Plot
","If I understand it right, the Ice Roads are a real thing. The movie takes it to a new level of course. With cliches that will make you cringe and a predictable plot and twists that you will be able to see from miles away (no pun intended).",/review/rw7064046/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2021,paul_haakonsen,6," It is a long, cold haul...
","I must admit that whenever Liam Neeson stars in a movie, then it is a movie that I feel that I must watch, because he definitely has a track record of some rather impressive movies these last many years.",/review/rw7064046/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2021,ferguson-6,5," a particular set of driving skills
","Greetings again from the darkness. Somehow, it's already time for Liam Neeson's semi-annual macho thriller. In this one, he gets to drive a big rig. Over a frozen river. He also gets to wear flannel, chew on a toothpick, and punch two guys (but no wolves) ... all while doing the right thing in order to save some trapped miners. And it's not about the money. Well, it starts out about the money, but in the end, it's not about the money!",/review/rw7064046/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2021,bombersflyup,2," Nope.
",The Ice Road has a thin premise and thin characterization also.,/review/rw7064046/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2021,Leofwine_draca,6," Not bad for what it is
","Another modern day action thriller with plenty of bad reviews. I'm convinced that audiences only care for superhero and comic book adaptations these days. In any case, THE ICE ROAD is influenced both by reality TV shows such as ICE ROAD TRUCKERS and the Friedkin classic SORCERER in the story of a convoy of trucks racing to rescue some trapped miners in an icy north Canadian province. A grizzled Liam Neeson heads the small cast, with the welcome Laurence Fishburne in support, and the acting is generally better than expected across the board. The film is over reliant on some slightly repetitive action scenes towards the climax (shades of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK) and has some very dodgy CGI at times, but otherwise it works quite well. It's fast-paced, character-focused, and has plenty of twists and suspense scenes which make it an amiable watch. Not a patch on SORCERER but not bad for a modern flick.",/review/rw7064046/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2021,zach-medearis,4," It's like die hard 5 but with trucks and ice
","This movie didn't need to be made. I'm surprised the eggheads at Netflix didn't just cast Adam Sandler. I'm neither a trucker or a miner, but I'm Insulted on the behalf of both professions.",/review/rw7064046/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2021,FixedYourEnding,6," Enjoyable if you ignore all the nonsense
","I like Liam Neeson movies. His rugged 'Mike"" character is back at it again. As a Netflix production ""The Ice Road"" suffers from the same illnesses that plagues many of their studios, mostly due to tight budget limit, such as cheap CGI, no connection to reality at parts, quick production that leaves erroneous shots (truck models that switch etc) and not being able to keep highly-paid actors for the length of the film.",/review/rw7064046/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2021,leesimon-26357,1," Flowers for Algernon, and weak stereotypes about the disabled for the rest of us

10 July 2021,classicsoncall,7," ""Mount up..., we're on a bull run!
","Definitely a movie to set your rational brain aside and watch simply for the sheer fun of it. That seems to be Liam Neeson's forté lately, and he does it in overdrive in this flick. Call the movie bad if you want, but one has to marvel at the way the film makers produced all the disasters in the picture, the first of which removes Laurence Fishburne from the story in a pulse pounding scenario. I'm watching this with my wife and she's got a blanket over her face every few minutes trying to ward off the inevitable. The backdrop to the story involves corruption at a regional level in which a company skimps on methane detectors and pays its miners to shut off their sensors. The cave in that develops results in Neeson's character and his disabled brother (Marcus Thomas) in a high stakes race over the titled 'Ice Road' to deliver a wellhead that's needed to save the men from suffocating. Starting out they're not alone, but conspiracy and espionage undermine the effort and at the finale, it's a race to the finish that defies credibility, but you don't watch this for a credible story, just the adrenaline rush. The mission is completed successfully for the most part, but not without it's share of misery for the brother truckers.",/review/rw7064046/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2021,jonasatmosfera,1," I wonder....

5 July 2021,wsawyer2,6," Not bad - suspenseful and interesting
","I went into this screening with low expectations, because I had been told it was not a particularly good film. And, yes, some parts are just a bit hoaky, some characters are stereotypes, and there are some inconsequential goofs (dry clothing in the truck cab, after full immersion in the lake).",/review/rw7064046/?ref_=tt_urv
