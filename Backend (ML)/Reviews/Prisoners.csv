28 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," An amusing film from the popular TV series ""The Addams Family""
","""The Adams Family"" is a very funny film that is very under rated. With a great all star cast you get just what you expect, a great comedy. The TV show was already funny enough, and then the movie came and I was on the floor laughing. It's fun to see a happy dysfunctional family. No, I'm not talking about ""The Osbornes"". All the characters are great and you really get into it. If you can tell me that you honestly did not get one laugh from this film, there is something very wrong with you. Because it is a very funny film. I would recommend this to anyone. It's a good watch on any day.",/review/rw3471983/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Addams family are far from being normal but they are rich and as such are their attorney's only chance of getting rich. Tully has debts up the yazoo and the only thing that stops his knees being violently replaced with fresh air is the fact that Abigail Craven's son Gordon looks eerily like Gomez's missing brother Fester. Shaving his head, Gordon enters the Addams home as Fester and tries to use his spare time to get into the family vault. However Gomez's joy at his return is gradually marred by a sneaking feeling that Fester is not himself Â– meanwhile Wednesday has no such doubts at all and is out to expose the impostor.",/review/rw3471983/?ref_=tt_urv

30 January 2006,nycritic,8," Gothic Kookiness
","Charles Addams' dark characters get the film treatment in Barry Sonnenfeld's THE ADDAMS FAMILY, which is something of a cross between the actual New Yorker comics and the 1960s television show. Not trying to lean too far to either, the movie stays at a safe plane, even incorporating a vague plot involving two grifters, Gordon and Abigail Craven, posing as Uncle Fester and a renowned psychiatrist (Christopher Lloyd and Elizabeth Wilson) who are in cahoots to rob the Addams of their fortune and house. The problem arises when Craven seems to go against his take-the-money-and-run attitude and when the Addams themselves appear to enjoy every minute that they're being taken advantage of. It suits the dark humor well, because since the Addams live in an alternative universe of their own creation in which dark is light, repugnant is beautiful, pain equals pleasure, death is life, and chaos equals order, it leaves the door open for many of their Gothic eccentricities to pull the rug over Lloyd and Wilson over and over again. It's clever, although its only problem is the ""needing to introduce the characters we all know"" setup which like in all movies based on comics or television shows, looks obvious.",/review/rw3471983/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," Great fun from the Addams Family!
","Well, I finally managed to write a review on this, and I have to say, I like this a lot. I do think Values is marginally better, but both are solid entertainment, two good examples of films, driven by character not plot(though there was a very good one in both films). Like Values, the rating is too low, why? My only criticism, is that I don't like the rap song over the end credits at all. Apart from that, it had spirited direction, great incidental music, great performances, and a gem of a black humour filled script.",/review/rw3471983/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2017,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,8," ""The Addams Family""- An amusing and stylish 90's revamp of the classic comedy franchise!
","For some reason, the 90's and early 2000's were a bit of a heyday when it came to contemporary adaptations of kitschy old TV-shows and stories. Everything from ""The Flintstones"" to ""Charlie's Angels""... from ""The Brady Bunch"" to ""Dudley Do-Right""... they all got remade, rebooted and re-imagined for then-modern audiences. But strangely, almost all of them were redone in typically either a self-satirical or self-deprecating way. Almost like the filmmakers were ashamed of the properties they were meant to be paying tribute to. But one particular film among them stands out for doing quite the opposite. For creating a respectful, honorable and faithful adaptation that kept changes to a necessary minimum while simply delivering a bigger and wilder version of what came before.",/review/rw3471983/?ref_=tt_urv

24 March 2005,jboothmillard,8," The Addams Family
","Based on the popular TV series (which there were a few of) and New Yorker cartoons - from the characters created by Charles Addams - comes this live action feature film about the kooky, spooky, eccentric and darkly comical humorous family, from director Barry Sonnenfeld (Men in Black). Basically The Addams Family are the strange scary movie stereotypes filled clan, with wife/mother Morticia (Anjelica Huston), husband/father Gomez (Raul Julia), the witch-like Granny (Judith Malina), Frankenstein's monster like butler Lurch (Carel Struycken), and the kids, Wednesday (young Christina Ricci) and Pugsley (Jimmy Workman). Notice anyone missing, yes, Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) disappeared 25 years ago after a fight with brother Gomez, and Abigail Craven (Elizabeth Wilson) wants to try and get the Addams' fortune, by using her ""son"" Gordon (Lloyd again), who has a striking resemblance to Fester, to con his way into the family, and find the fortune. As time goes by though, Gordon slowly finds himself settling very nicely as if he really was Fester, oh, and by the end, you realise it is really him, Craven found him with amnesia. Also starring Dan Hedaya as Tully Alford, Dana Ivey as Margaret Alford and Paul Benedict as Judge Womack. The dark comedy is wonderfully strange, the performances from Julia, Huston and Lloyd are marvellous, young Ricci also shines with her moments as the daughter, just a very good dark comedy film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Make Up Artist and Best Production Design. Very good!",/review/rw3471983/?ref_=tt_urv

He is soon visited by a lawyer who is hoping the get his hands on the Addams' family fortune so he can pay off his debts; his initial scheme fails but when he meets the son of the woman he owes money to he seems a striking resemblance to Fester. Soon the look-alike is trying to get into the family and most of them believe he is indeed the long lost Fester; young Wednesday is more suspicious though.

","Finally a movie with the Addams Family! I have always been a fan of this family. I saw some episodes of the original series, even though I never saw it all, nor am I old enough to have seen it on TV. They are adorable in their way of being out of the ordinary. And the film is very true to its essence. I think the film will please adults and young people a little. By its nature, I believe it is not suitable for children, but young people over 12 years old will perfectly adhere to the film.

28 April 2004,Coventry,9," Black > blacker > blackest > THE ADDAMS FAMILY!
","Being a kid from the 80's, this film was my very first acquaintance with the legendary ""The Addams Family"", and only watched the mid-60s TV-series (starring John Astin as the original Gomez Addams) much later. I am a big fan of the concept of sarcastic black comedy; however, and therefore I was very much looking forward to Sonnenfeld's film. The daily rituals of this family are just great! Mom and dad and their macabre passion for each other, siblings constantly thinking up games to murder each other, and a bodiless hand racing around the massive Gothic mansion! It's all very sinisterly and depressingly portrayed, but the humor is hilarious and ultra-effective. Admittedly, the whole concept exclusively revolves around one gag, namely a sort of behavioral inversion, but it works every single time! The characters remain serious no matter what crazed madness they proclaim, and even the driest forms of vulgarity are considered to be the most normal things in the world. The scenery and locations are simply brilliant, and all the supportive characters that walk through the screen (Cousin It, Dr. Pider-Schloss, a Siamese twin, ...) carry a special place in my heart. Uncle Fester Addams, Gomez' long lost brother, returns to the family, but he's brainwashed into an imposter by greedy lawyers in order to steal the Addams' family fortune. My best advice is to repeatedly watch ""The Addams Family"" and its sequel, because the number of gags, hidden references, and little trivia details there are to discover is endless. This is simply one of the funniest comedies I ever saw, although not for everyone's taste. Barry Sonnenfeld's direction is occasionally very uneven, but it was only his first major assignment after primarily working as a cameraman. Still, you can't help thinking how even more awesome this film must have been if Tim Burton (the producers' preferred choice) would have helmed it.",/review/rw3471983/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2019,RhapsodyReviews,8," Great Family Film.
","Review:
'The Addams Family' is a supernatural-black-comedy film directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. It is based on the characters from the cartoon created by cartoonist Charles Addams and the TV series produced by David Levy.
I don't have much experience with older incarnations of the Addams Family. So, I can't make an educated comparison. However, this film excels in every way with disturbing humor and just plain eccentrically absurdity.
The movie is centered around a family that aren't like your typical family. They enjoy the strange and unusual rather than the normalcy of life. After losing a family member a con artist by the name of Tully Alford (Dan Hedaya), claims he can steal the family's riches he gets the help from Abigail Craven (Elizabeth Wilson) and her son Gordon (Christopher Lloyd). Having Gordon pretend to be the family member they lost, Uncle Fester.
Raul Julia, Anjelica Huston, and a young Christina Ricci all deliver. They're truly a delight to watch, delivering the most macabre lines without even coming close to cracking a smile, yet having me in stitches every time. Even Christopher Lloyd, playing a far more energetic character, manages to bring in a maniacal edge to the performance. I don't think there's an actor in the movie who doesn't understand the role they play.
This movie does a lot of things right. One of which being the perfect blend of dark humor with the slap-stick humor that was popular in the 19990's. This is Barry Sonnenfeld's first feature film he directed and what a debut he brings us.
Overall, from beginning to end you love this family we are watching. Even though they are strange and like things a considered to be normal person would never like, you can understand why. Also, the chemistry between Morticia and Gomez in this movie is crazy, the actors did an amazing job.

19 May 2015,mark.waltz,7," Creepy characters you can't help but love in spite of their ""dark"" side.
","Certainly there are going to be those who take this comic variation on ""Tales From the Darkside"" as something that was influenced by the devil with its irreverent take on family structure and focus on characters who obviously seem to take great pleasure in following some seemingly morbid characteristics. Yes, they are indeed absolutely ookie, with gorgeous mom Morticia (that's Anjelica Huston, not Cher...), extremely sexy dad Gomez (a very dreamy Raul Julia), the witch-like Grandma (Judith Malina), portly Pugsly (Jimmy Workman) and the very dour Wednesday (a delightful Christina Ricci) not the Brady Bunch, not the Cunninghams, not the Cleavers, and very far even from the Munsters. Gomez has been mourning the disappearance of his brother Fester (which means ""to rot"") for years, and every year like clockwork on the anniversary of his disappearance, they do a sÃ©ance to try and find out where he is. Thanks to some con-artist clients of the family attorney (Dan Heydara), ""Fester"" does show up during the sÃ©ance, actually the son of a hard-hearted con-artist (a very funny Elizabeth Wilson). She pretends to be his psychiatrist, having ""discovered"" him in the midst of the Bermuda triangle. Cynical Wednesday is suspicious, and this eventually leads to the Addams being removed from their own home so ""Fester"" and mommie dearest can find out where the family fortune is being hidden.",/review/rw3471983/?ref_=tt_urv
