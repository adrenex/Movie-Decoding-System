16 October 2019,perica-43151,9," Fun, weird, authentic, indie feel good film
","This movie has an authentic vibe but is at the same time a very sweet movie, that honors the nonconformist and weird. A romantic comedy of sorts, but quite quirky and original, it is one indie gem. Not easily forgotten, great fun that will leave you uplifted and optimistic, a movie filled with authentic positive energy - truly recommended.",/review/rw5877932/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2012,KnightsofNi11,8," Sincere and enjoyable feel good movie
","When a man puts a classified ad in the newspaper asking for a companion to time travel with him, a magazine writer and two interns go find him to find out his story. Aubrey Plaza plays Darius, one of the interns who at first seems pretty disinterested in the whole situation, ends up being the one who has to pretend like she wants to time travel. She expects to be working with a total nutjob, completely off his rocker, but instead she finds that Kenneth, the man who put the ad in the paper, is actually an incredible insightful, sweet, and softhearted person and that time traveling is more a facade for finding yourself and it's more of a metaphor for fixing old mistakes. It's a surprisingly touching film that has a lot more to offer than one might have expected.",/review/rw5877932/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2019,Sleepin_Dragon,9," Loved it.
","I've watched so many sub standard films recently, that I feared for the worst with this one. It's so nice to be genuinely blown away by a film, and this one did the job. It is just a lovely, sweet, enjoyable film. It doesn't have massive action, gore or big special effects, but it has depth, it's as much about relationships as it is about time travel, the time travel aspect of the film is secondary to the complexity of the relationships.",/review/rw5877932/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2019,imseeg,8," One of those rare movies that fascinated me so much that I kept watching the end credits till the very end, filled with a joyous feeling of delight and surprise.
","What a wonderfully, joyous, uplifting, quirky story about a man who puts an ad in a newspaper, in which he is searching for fellow humans who want to TIME TRAVEL. Safety NOT guaranteed. A newspaper magazine thinks this might be an interesting news article and sends 3 young reporters to check out this mysterious guy who placed the ad for the time travel. During researching this time travel guy, things quickly get out of control in a very amusing and quirky way.",/review/rw5877932/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2018,cricketbat,8," Not a laugh-out-loud comedy
","Safety Not Guaranteed is not a laugh-out-loud comedy, but it is an amusing comedy. Aubrey Plaza plays herself with a twist of emotion and Mark Duplass gives a very convincing performance as an amiable crazy person. This movie has heart, it has quirk, it has cheese and it appropriately balances the three. Some may be put off by the strangeness of it all, but that's just the government implant in your brain talking.",/review/rw5877932/?ref_=tt_urv

","LOGLINE: Mark Duplass (Puffy Chair & Humpday) plays Kenneth, the local small town weirdo who bags groceries and places a classified ad seeking a companion for time travel. Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Recreation & Funny People) plays Darius, an intern sent in on assignment with her co-workers (Jake M. Johnson & Karan Soni) to secretly pose as potential time travel candidates and get the scoop for the entertainment magazine.",/review/rw5877932/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2012,buzzbruin,9," Amazing
","A wonderful film. The story is science fiction, fantasy and real-life relationships. The plot is unique (I know some reviewers have likened it to the back to the future series which was for fun and was fun). It is not only funny, (laugh out loud funny) but mysterious as to what is really going on and stir in some fantasy and science fiction-- but underneath is the inspection of all human beings and their lives and relationships. The casting was superb and the scenic northwest photography was great, I didn't know any of the actors but suffice to say they were chosen by a director of amazing talent. His idea his plot and his script were really really fine. I saw it in LA in Burbank and the audience was mostly the internet set and they loved it. All of their generations electronic things were a big part of the film, but this masterful director reached me, a senior--explaining the kids and yet reaching me with the love stories and those of friendship. Thus the director brought the old universal story of love among all of us. I can only say he is in for a tough career because with this film he has set the bar for himself and his crew very very high. Based on this work he will be great!!",/review/rw5877932/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2016,alanpgini,7," Why I keep watching Indie films, is for the few Gems like this.
","Very slow, but its worth it. Great ending, but the last words of the ending could have been better. These two things helped bring the film down a couple notches. Plus it also didn't stay true to the ad in the paper, which had inspired this story-line. Add in a small plot hole near the end, and a 9 of 10 movie becomes a 7 of 10. But they can be forgiven for these small sins. You've got to give credit to the producers who made this on a 4 thousand dollar budget, and made 4 million out of it. Who am I to nit-pick that kind of success? It's these kind of shoestring budget movies, few as they are in this quality, that makes Hollywood look like an idiots playground. Even with its problems, its well worth the watch, based upon the total package of being a sci-fi love story that works. This came out in 2012, near the same time as ""The Adjustment Bureau"" film. Sadly, these two didn't start a trend. Like all good films, it makes you think, after the final credits roll. I myself have always said, that regrets are for people with time machines. After all, we were who we were back then. But I'm also a sucker for a good film, or even just a good love story, that tries to answer those regrets.",/review/rw5877932/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2012,napierslogs,7," With witty lines and well written characters we're entertained through to the original ending.
","""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is based on an actual classified ad placed in a magazine, looking for someone to go back in time with. The real ad was just a joke for last-minute content. The movie, though, wonders what if it wasn't a joke. One young writer and two young interns are assigned to the story to figure out who is behind the ad, and how crazy he is.",/review/rw5877932/?ref_=tt_urv

10 June 2012,gortx,," SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED - SF lite, Quirky heavy
","Another entry in the recent lite Sci-Fi sweepstakes: Films such as ANOTHER WORLD, MELANCHOLIA, SOUND OF MY VOICE which use a slight SF tinge in what would otherwise be 'straight' non-genre movies. The film that SF fans will probably most closely associate it with is HAPPY ACCIDENTS. Both are Rom-Coms with a woman entering into a relationship with an oddball man who claims to be a time-traveler.",/review/rw5877932/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is really good, enjoyable, and entertaining. A great balance of drama and science fiction withe the ending that I excepted. It is well acted. Aubrey Plaza is very believable. and likable. One of the best things is the story never looses tract of the objective. This movie is worthy re-watching many times.",/review/rw5877932/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2020,shkamath-01355,8," Hilarious! Insane! Feel Good!
","""Safet Not Guaranteed"" is this hilarious time travelling movie that just makes you feel warm inside. It's a good mix of comedy and romance with a hint of sci-fi to keep you hooked and entertained. Aubrey Plaza and Mark Duplass make for an unusual yet amazing pair that are the heart & soul of the movie. Loved Karan Soni too! It keeps the story fairly simple, little twists & turns, little conflict towards the end and then the explosive finale. It has something for everyone and I highly recommend it!",/review/rw5877932/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2012,Cinnyaste,2," Synthetic Mumblecore RomCom
","First, the poster touts ""From the Producer of ""Little Miss Sunshine."" It's actually only one of the Producers. The true genius behind the terrific ""...Sunshine"" is sadly lacking here. This film is the venue of the Duplass brothers of mumblecore fame. (Brother Mark took the lead role.) And mumblecore ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is. (One wonders if the Duplass boys will ever move forward.) ",/review/rw5877932/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2012,mrtrsharp,9," How does a film get a standing ovation?
","Every so often I stumble across the kind of film that captures both heart and soul, the kind of film that makes me laugh and cry, makes me scoot forward on the edge of my seat, not because of the thrill of the chase or the climax of dramatic tension, but simply because I am cheering for the characters to make it! Because somehow my hope has found a way to attach to the hope of the characters, because I have felt strangely welcomed into their journey, because I am longing to believe that this world is more than a cold, cynical place, and that something beyond the natural may just be possible. There are lots of ""feel-good"" movies about relationships and love, but not quite as many that touch a chord deep within all of us that is usually reserved for the realm of religion or spiritual experience. Sometimes, a movie is made that feels transcendent. For me, that is how I left the theater after watching Safety Not Guaranteed at Sundance. It helped that the packed theater erupted in a cathartic cheer at the movie's final moment, which tells me that something else was going on for my fellow film-goers as well. In short, I think that this funny, engaging, interesting, character-driven, heart-warming independent film shot on a shoestring budget on location in Oregon touched that part in all of us that longs to believe in the unbelievable, that wonders if the ""impossible"" might, just might possibly be true after all.",/review/rw5877932/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2012,sherilcox,9," Sweet Summer Sleeper
","If you like smart dialogue, an imaginative narrative, and well developed character, SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED is your film. The premise is well articulated with believable relationships portrayed by a talented cast. Audrey Plaza's star turn took the dopey outsider and added her own understated charm that illuminated every frame, especially the campfire scene with Mark Duplass. His performance was perhaps the riskiest.....playing a lonely but driven crusader whose character took a little from FISHER KING, a little from HEROS, a little more from BEAUTIFUL MIND and added a touch of STARMAN.",/review/rw5877932/?ref_=tt_urv

3 July 2020,JoeytheBrit,," Safety Not Guaranteed review
","Essentially a relationship movie disguised as a time-travel adventure, Safety Not Guaranteed is based on a spoof advert that appeared in Backwoods Home magazine back in the 1990s. The ad, reproduced more or less verbatim, offers up an infinite number of creative opportunities, but Derek Connolly's screenplay focuses on what kind of character would place such an ad if it was genuine. Again, plenty of options, but Mark Duplass's eccentric supermarket worker is your stereotypical conspiracy theorist with little to set him apart from others of his type. It's watchable enough, even though the plot occasionally goes AWOL, and it's impossible for Jake Johnson not to steal every scene he's in..",/review/rw5877932/?ref_=tt_urv
