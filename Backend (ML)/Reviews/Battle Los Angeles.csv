15 September 2009,Cinema_Fan,5," Enjoy it for what it is: A picture show and nothing more.
","The Picture of Dorian Gray, as penned by the Irish wit Oscar Wilde (1854 - 1900), is a tale of high-brow debauchery and limitless pleasures of body and soul and the corruption, by one Lord Henry Wotton, of the young, handsome and soon to be narcissistic 19th century rock 'n roll hell-raiser Dorian Gray.",/review/rw2367387/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2020,AlsExGal,5," Update is more of a horror film than the 1940's original
","Updated version of Oscar Wilde's story geared to modern sensibilities that would perhaps appeal especially to horror genre enthusiasts.. . It seemed more or less conventional period piece for awhile but about 40 minutes in, an event occurred that nearly killed the whole thing for me. But the acting was so good I stayed.",/review/rw2367387/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2011,ma-cortes,6," Haunting Oscar Wilde tale of a young man whose painting ages while he retains youth

17 February 2010,nyc10012,2," Did the screenwriters even read the original story by Wilde?
","There's not a single thing inherently wrong about adapting old stories in new and surprising ways. Unfortunately the writers removed all of the original class and gender subtext in the original story and then added naked ladies. Really that's all there is to this adaptation. Some unusually bland acting goes with the bland writing. I have a feeling the actors knew the movie wasn't going well, took the paycheck, and just went a long for the ride.",/review/rw2367387/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2010,fivebyfive_6,4," What a disappointment!
","When I first heard about the Picture of Dorian Gray becoming a movie I was excited and overjoyed. I thought with this new technology the 21st century has, The Picture of Dorian Gray will receive the justice it deserves. However, I was very wrong. I just finished watching the movie and I felt compelled to write a review about it.The movie was horrible. A grand disappointment which had such potential to be great. Firstly, the movie should have claimed to be inspired by the novel not based on it. I say this because the movie was very different from the novel. All of Oscar Wilde's wit and beauty which truly made the novel classic was ruined and overshadowed by the changes the movie made. I understand that there can be biased when reading a novel before seeing the movie adaption, but this movie adaption was appalling. I wont give anything away but the movie seriously ruined Oscar Wilde's vision and above all his memorable characters. Once the movie changed aspects in the novel the whole thing became horrible. Trust me, you'll agree if you've read the novel first. ",/review/rw2367387/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2011,claudio_carvalho,8," Enjoyable Version of Oscar Wilde's Novel

13 November 2011,itamarscomix,4," A disappointing and shallow adaptation
","As is, The Picture of Dorian Gray is pretty much unfilmable. The 1945 version was close to doing it justice, but changes must be made whenever an adaptation is attempted. Still, when I see a new version coming out, I hope that it would bring more to the table than this sorry affair.",/review/rw2367387/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2014,ModroMore,6," What a waste of pretty costumes
","Well, it seems they have taken some liberties with adapting the story from the original novel, which sadly for Hollywood films, almost always leaves the movie just a bit worse than than the book. My first thought about the movie after the ending was : ""well they had some gorgeous outfits"".",/review/rw2367387/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2009,irisheyes317,1," Promising concept. Horrendous execution
","It is inevitable that when any classic novel (Oscar Wilde's being no exception) is adapted for the screen, certain liberties will be taken to make it an engaging story to an audience present for 2 1/2 hours. In this 21st century execution, Oliver Parker includes an interesting theme certainly real in Wilde's Victorian era and widely discussed on the social AND artistic scene today: the failure of paternal figures. The longing for an admirable father figure serving as Dorian's ultimate Achilles' heel is a fascinating theory to draw from. It could've certainly presented itself as a unique theme to distinguish the film from Albert Lewin's 1945 version.",/review/rw2367387/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2019,TheMovieDiorama,4," Dorian Gray paints a tediously dull portrait of a lifeless character portrayal.
","A little known fact about me, Wilde's gothic novel 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' is in fact one of my favourite pieces of literature to ever be put on paper. It's views on hedonism, immoral life choices and the representation of the deadly sins, gives its narrative an overbearing sense of dread. That's without mentioning that cursed portrait. This adaptation however seems to miss the point entirely and settles for a soft-pornographic approach as opposed to a philosophical perspective. A young naive Dorian Gray enters London (like a lost child!) and is quickly swept up in an aristocratic lifestyle of excessive pleasure, inadvertently cursed to a painting that grants him eternal youth.",/review/rw2367387/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2009,Cs_The_Moment,8," picture perfect
","i have to admit, i had my doubts about this movie at first. After reading the odd couple of reviews, i wasn't entirely sure if this film was for me. i am not a fan of horror and, like quite a few people i suspect, was put off slightly by the ""horror"" classification that most reviews seemed to mention. However, as it turns out, it is not like your conventional thriller.",/review/rw2367387/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2017,paul_haakonsen,4," A visually great presentation of a hollow story...
","Being somewhat familiar with the essence and the story of Dorian Gray from literature, but not having actually read the book, then I must admit that I had some expectations for a movie such as this 2009 rendering of the story by director Oliver Parker. However, it is not before late in 2017 that I actually got around to find the time to sit down and watch the movie, despite having owned the DVD for years.",/review/rw2367387/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2009,larry-411,8," Excellent modern adaptation, does Oscar Wilde justice
","I attended the World Premiere of ""Dorian Gray"" at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Starring Colin Firth and Ben Barnes, this newest adaptation of Oscar Wilde's classic Gothic horror story was directed by Oliver Parker from a Toby Finlay script. Set in Victorian England, Gray (Barnes) and his mentor Lord Henry Wotton (Firth) embark on an adventure that will lead them down paths they could never have imagined. I'll leave it at that for those unfamiliar with the story.",/review/rw2367387/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2013,s-young835,4," Half cocked
","Haven't read the book in years and was very much looking forward to watching this but from the opening shot I knew I was in for a big disappointment. It looked and felt like an episode of a period TV series, even making the first shot a quick flashback to last weeks episode. It felt like a cheap dated effect.",/review/rw2367387/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2012,Sjhm,1," I gave up
","A frustrating, irritating CGI'd mess, filled with swirling cameras and predictable orgy scenes that ultimately failed to accurately portray Victorian London or the contents of the book. In between bouts of depravity people wander around in Victorian clothes looking very pretty and completely lost. Ben Barnes is neither pretty enough, nor possessed of sufficient character to be the eponymous Dorian. In his hands, Gray is lifeless and somewhat uninteresting. Sybil Vane appears, there is no chemistry, and she drowns herself after his rejection. There are no reasons for his rejection, he just rejects her and she drowns. In the book the reasons for Sybil's suicide are more complex and interesting, and her death is through swallowing poison not drowning. After that incident the film careers downhill with the brakes off. Unlike the source material it is devoid of any kind of personality and just limps on. Basil the artist goes in the river in Gray's truck, which any number of people could have identified, yet miraculously Basil's body is found. There is no rhyme or reason to any of it, rarely has Colin Firth been as dull as ditch-water, but he is both boring and irritating in this story. There is no sense of time passing. The action of the story takes place over at least a couple of decades, there is no suggestion that this is the case. Unfortunately, the complete lack of time-line, charisma-free zone, and just the sheer tedious drudgery of it put me off to the extent that I did not make it to the end. My advice, if you want a ghost story of significance, this is not the one for you. If you are looking for Dorian Grey, Stuart Townsend played him with verve, wit and charm in The League of ExtraOrdinary Gentlemen.",/review/rw2367387/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2009,kester_gillard,7," Thoroughly enjoyable
","I've been puzzled by the negative reviews i've seen for this as i really enjoyed it. It looks superb, with some excellent atmospheric Victorian locations. Ben Barnes is perfect as Dorian, good looking but not bland & still sympathetic throughout the film. The character of Emily which has been invented for the film works very well, and Colin Firth is magnificent in his pivotal role. Dorians gradual deprivation is well shown without heading off into exploitation and he is given real depth. His tragedy is very obvious.I must admit to not having read the original book as yet, but I do intend to now. I really enjoyed it but for its full benefit I recommend seeing it at the cinema.",/review/rw2367387/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2011,dawejon-113-632078,2," Laughably Bad Movie
","I hardly know where to start describing just how bad this movie is. First I will say that the movie, especially the first half, feels terribly choppy and rushed. The relationship between Dorian and Sybil, for example, from initial meeting to marriage proposal, to break-up and suicide is covered in the space of TWELVE MINUTES. This is including the scenes in between in which she is not involved. The director probably could've put a montage of them running through tall grass and painting each other with paint rollers while giggling merrily and it would've done a better job of establishing this relationship in believable fashion.",/review/rw2367387/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2009,Sapfarah,4," Brilliant - until the last 20 minutes where it becomes the picture.

29 April 2012,kirstycaddy87,2," Just no!
","I decided to watch this film two days after I finished reading the book. In short, it missed out every single thing that makes Oscar Wilde's book great. As well as the subtleties, it misses out the great speeches, and even fails to enforce the real themes in the book to any depth. Henry, Dorian, and Basil's characters are poorly explored and established, which I would say is a massive part of the books appeal. This is further enforced by very poor acting! I was dubious about Colin Firth's suitability for the role, but with some more time i believe that he could have worked, but the scripts didn't allow it. Dorian's character possibly has the look, but depth of acting just wasn't there. I'm hardly a film critic, but this is my opinion. Incredibly disappointing to say the least.",/review/rw2367387/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2011,archwordsmith,7," watch this for Ben Barnes and Colin firth
","I have never read the real novel on which this movie is based but am well acquainted with the legacy of Dorian gray. so when i sat down to watch this movie i wasn't having any pre screening expectations like i had for da vinci code, harry potters and countless other films based on novels and stories i have read. so i sat and watched, and i sure loved this one. its a well made movie with some stellar performance by 'prince Caspian'. mark my words folks, given the right opportunity he can be the next breakout star of Hollywood, he can be cause in this movie he has shown such a myriad of emotions as his character gets transformed from a simple handsome youngster to a devilish man.",/review/rw2367387/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2012,Leofwine_draca,4," Looks nice, goes on a bit
","DORIAN GRAY suffers from the same problems as other recent adaptations of Victorian-era novels (I'm thinking the 2011 BBC dramatisation of GREAT EXPECTATIONS): it looks great, but in the screenwriters's attempts to present relevant themes and concerns to modern day viewers, it loses something in the execution. The result is more often than not a production in which the actors look like they're playing dress up while there's no real heart involved.",/review/rw2367387/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2011,garyvanhorn,9," I wish Hollywood would make films like this.
","Based on Oscar Wilde's novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, Dorian Gray is a compelling story about a young English nobleman who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for eternal youth. The story begins in late nineteenth century England, where Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes) has just inherited his familial estate following the death of his father. Gray is young, naive, and wholly innocent, at least until he befriends Lord Henry Watton (Colin Firth). Watton is an avid believer, though not a practitioner, of a hedonistic lifestyle. Every pleasure should be sampled, every desire indulged. The young Dorian Gray is completely taken in by this philosophy, thus begins his long, slow decent into corruption and madness.",/review/rw2367387/?ref_=tt_urv
