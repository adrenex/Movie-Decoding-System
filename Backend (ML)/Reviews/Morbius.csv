31 March 2022,FeastMode,3," I'm BEGGING you, please make Rated R movies
","Movies like Venom and Morbius need to be Rated R. They would be significantly better if they weren't restrained. And we've now seen multiple highly successful Rated R superhero movies (Deadpool, Logan). I'm BEGGING the movie studios to have the courage to go all out.",/review/rw8021944/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2022,Thanos_Alfie,6," Simple start...
","""Morbius"" is an Action - Adventure movie in which we watch Dr. Michael Morbius, a biochemist trying to find the cure behind an extremely rare blood disease. He infects himself and he is completely changed by it.",/review/rw8021944/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2022,paul_haakonsen,7," Turned out to be rather enjoyable...
","I have to admit that I had really been looking forward to watching ""Morbius"" ever since I saw the first trailer. And having been reading the comic books, I will say that Michael Morbius is one of my favorite Marvel characters, so it was nice that the character was finally brought to the big screen.",/review/rw8021944/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2022,aidanratesmovies,6," Overdone CGI and editing aside- I enjoyed this one
","Entertaining and very atmospheric, Morbius manages to serve up yet another helping of campy superhero indulgence despite many little flaws. I'll start off with the problems I had with this film- that mainly being its blatant editing and CGI. I know many people say this about a lot of superhero films, but coming from a horror lovers perspective- as well as fitting the atmospheric and tone Life director Daniel Espinosa seemed to pair within it- this movie really should have been rated R. It feels like Sony really did censor and edit this one as much as they could have, with the blood and violence being as limited as possible. It takes away from the experience as a whole, one moment in particular where a man acts like his throat is cut open but there is LITERALLY NOTHING THERE. Unsurprisingly, as with the case with a lot of films like this, the CGI can be a bit overused at times. For the most part I liked the look of vampire blood hungry Morbius taken on by Jared Leto- but other similar CGI and at times that CGI itself can feel a bit too ugly and forced for comfort. The fight scenes towards the end in particular are also overdone with CGI, and I just really wish Sony would have let the people working on this film give some life to the project instead of worrying about its box office gross. I know i've complained a lot so far, but in terms of a film- I oddly did enjoy this one for the most part. Sure it's messy, Matt Smith's character is a bit over the top and it has some formulaic moments- but it is a very entertaining film. Leto and Arjona give their all to their performances and it has a lot of cool ideas and concepts that are interesting to see fleshed out on screen- particularly with Morbius in particular as he begins to learn how to control himself. There's a lot of humanity hidden beneath the surface in this film though, even with some formulaic moments, there's a lot of depth and heart put into the titular character and it really allows you to empathize both with the film's story as well as Leto on screen. In the end, I enjoyed Morbius- it is far from perfect but it was a solid superhero endeavor and I'm curious to see what they may do with this character next.",/review/rw8021944/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2022,JoBloTheMovieCritic,6," Morbius
","6/10 - I don't know what all the fuss is about with this one when the quality matches that of either Venom movie and while I didn't love the visual design of the vampires, I thought the cinematography, VFX, sound design, and Adria Arjona (who is now on my ""Actors to Watch"" list) really elevated the relatively weak story.",/review/rw8021944/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2022,DeadMansTrousers,7," People need to learn to enjoy movies without comparing them
","This is not your favourite huge budget Marvel movie like No Way Home, this is a introductory film of a somewhat niche character and if you compare any comic film to something like No Way Home it will fall flat. I went into this with an open mind and I had an enjoyable time. It's a different type of Marvel film with dark humour and I enjoyed myself while watching it. I am familiar with the character and have read the comics and I was not disappointed with what Leto and Smith respectively brought to their roles. I think if you are able to enjoy a film without nitpicking at it then you'll have fun with this.",/review/rw8021944/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2022,Nixon_Carmichael,3," A profoundly bad movie. Sony is 100% guilty of false advertising. Early review.

31 March 2022,AdrenalinDragon,2," Venom doesn't seem too bad now
","No surprises this was awful. Jared Leto is terrible and Matt Smith was annoying. CGI was laughingly bad and the slow-mo action and wonky editing made things borderline unwatchable. Writing was all over the place too with some terrible dialogue. There's little fun and it took itself way too seriously. Honestly, this made Venom seem alright in comparison.",/review/rw8021944/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,rjgrund-123-603438,7," Better Than Expected
",From all the bad press and reviews I suspect that people were looking for more then it intended to be. Seeing it for free on Netflix might have dampened the pain. This is not an MCU movie. It's trying to be one in the Underworld flair. Maybe too much Underworld. One of the problems is that Jared Leto cannot carry a movie. He needs a stronger lead to work off of. When he has that he's more than enough. The subtlety of the effects works for me. The bad guy Milo was a little too one dimensional and flat. Predictable. Weak writing in that regard. Not enough character development. I can see Morbius working in an ensemble MCU cast. Hopefully he will be given that chance.,/review/rw8021944/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2022,DarkVulcan29,8," Not great, but I liked it more than The Eternals
","Michael Morbius(Jared Leto) a doctor who is slowly dying from a rare blood disease, struggles to find a cure, when he thinks he has, but things work a little too well, until he discovers there's more supernatural to it, then he could have imagined.",/review/rw8021944/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2022,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,3," ""I... am... Venom""? Movie, just because you aim low doesn't mean you can reach it, not if you're gonna put in this little effort
","Dr Michael Morbius(Jared Leto, playing the role fairly lowkey, perhaps to avoid reminding people of Juggalo Joker. ...I mean, he's playing a vampire. Just saying, iIt's not unreasonable to expect some ham) has a rare blood disease. He figures that the answer is bats, and tests it on himself. Let's be honest, who of us wouldn't do that, in that situation? Of course, it goes wrong and he becomes a creature of the night, which is a slight upgrade from merely dressing, talking and moving like one.",/review/rw8021944/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2022,goswamidiptanshu,8," Its a Decent movie!
","The pacing is tight and the action was awesome, the colors effects while in a fight was looking amazing, the story was decent as a origin, The 1st half was good although the final act the last 30mins were little meh, the villian's suddenly gone rogue was little odd felt like it just happened and the Nurse's stuff felt lost at the end with it the post credits just didn't make no sense considering the man morbious was. Overall 1st half was good and the ending felt little mess although its a part entertaining and a decent watch.",/review/rw8021944/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2022,eddie_baggins,1," A toothless and inept Marvel offering
","Delayed a total of 6 times on its way to its eventual release this week around the world, Sony and Marvel's collaboration to bring its anti-hero Dr. Michael Morbius to life appeared to be one of those cursed productions that was doomed from the start and upon seeing this toothless and spineless comic book adaptation on the big screen its safe to say that the world would've been far better off had Morbius stayed delayed permanently.",/review/rw8021944/?ref_=tt_urv

",A vampire film without blood. That says it all. And it clearly shows that the film has been poorly thought since the start. Not to mention that the character is probably one of the most unknown and uninteresting comic book characters.,/review/rw8021944/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2022,kevin_robbins,7," This is not a great addition to the marvel universe but it is an entertaining one, much like the Venom movies
",Morbius (2022) is a movie my wife and I recently watched in theatres. The storyline follows a doctor with a rare blood disease that is in his final days. Him and his childhood friend do their best to cope with being on their death bed. When the doctor has a breakthrough he discovers the cure is as much a curse as a gift...that doesn't prevent his friend from wanting a taste. Can Morbius find a way to save him and his friend and modify his cure or will his friend get his hands on the cure and cause all new problems?,/review/rw8021944/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2022,tresm87,7," Morbius is another interesting yet scattered offering from the Sony-verse that delves into the more horror aspects of this anti hero.
",Much like venom it seems people are going to either love or hate anything from the Sonyverse. Some hate it because it's not in the MCU and still uses characters from the MCU spiderverse. Some love it for its more dark delivery and darker comedy. I actually enjoy what Sony is doing by making movies for the more vicious anti heroes while making them grounded for the most part. The MCU rarely touches on those important details. Morbius is very much like the first venom in its set up. Gives a nice origin story with some intriguing body horror and more gruesome than normal imagery for a comic book film. Definitely has some scattered plot pieces but it's serviceable. Also leaves more room for expansion in the world if the Sonyverse. Leto was great imo and still proves he's a fantastic actor. Visuals are very effective and vibrant. Overall the film is what I expected and it was solid.,/review/rw8021944/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2022,stormbailey,7," This movie does not deserve a 4.8
",This movie is definitely not as bad as the critics have rated it. It's nothing amazing but it's not horrible either.
