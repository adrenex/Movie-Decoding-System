23 March 2022,paul-allaer,8," Startling and disturbing movie is one of this year's best so far
","As ""Fresh"" (2022 release; 115 min.) opens, we got to know Noa, a twenty-something woman who is not having much luck on the dating scene. Then one night she gets to know a guy while at the grocery store. They hit it off, and before we know it, they are off on a weekend vacation...",/review/rw7974202/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2022,ferguson-6,6," a particular taste
","Greetings again from the darkness. Discotheques and Night Clubs were regularly referred to as 'meat markets', and all movie lovers are familiar with the term 'meet-cute'. It's rare for meat and meet to merge into a cautionary tale of modern-day dating, but that's what we get from director Mimi Cave's first feature film and a script from Lauryn Kahn (IBIZA, 2018). This twisted film should slide easily into the Midnight Movie rotation for those looking for a slicer, rather than a slasher.",/review/rw7974202/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2022,kevin_robbins,9," This is a fantastic ""new"" addition to the horror genre at a time horror fans are starved for something new and original
","Fresh (2022) is a movie I recently watched on Hulu. The storyline follows a single lady a little desperate to find a half decent date. She finds a nice guy and they date for several weeks and then he pops the big question, ""would you like to take a cabin trip?"" She's excited and goes changing her life forever...",/review/rw7974202/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2022,JoBloTheMovieCritic,8," Fresh
","8/10 - Daisy Edgar-Jones, Sebastian Stan, and Jojo T. Gibbs all turn in solid performances in this unique, wonderfully weird, slightly repulsive, and entrancing horror comedy (with a fantastic payoff) that is perfect for fans of fellow Searchlight release, Ready or Not.",/review/rw7974202/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2022,paul_haakonsen,5," It needed a bit more seasoning...
","I must admit that I was initially intrigued by the synopsis for this 2022 thriller titled ""Fresh"" from writer Lauryn Kahn and director Mimi Cave. However, I hadn't heard about the movie prior to sitting down to watch it, so I wasn't sure what I was in for here. But with it being a new movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I opted to give the movie a viewing.",/review/rw7974202/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2022,AfricanBro,6," Well, that took a turn
","Firstly imagine how much money Steve would have made off of Sheila from Santa Clarita diet. Fresh is not what I expected, it's not a comedy and even though it's quite gory I can't call it a horror either but that's the nearest genre you could give it. It's not there to scare you out your couch or sleep; maybe out of your dating life but that's about it. It's a romance gone wrong. I like how it combines two of my favorite genres because I'm a sucker for lovey dovey movies but then it takes a turn. The first part of the movie is quite normal, girl with an inauspicious dating life to say the least, meets a seemingly nice guy and they hit off. A meet-cute I believe it's called. The opening credits roll in after 30min as if to signal the end to that and start of something else. A 30min intro.",/review/rw7974202/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2022,eddie_baggins,8," One of 2022's unexpected surprises
","A refreshingly unpredictable and off-kilter debut feature from director to watch Mimi Cave, Fresh is a horror hybrid with killer energy and memorable lead turns from its main duo Daisy Edgar-Jones and Sebastian Stan, as the two play their parts in a depraved and gripping tale that refuses to play to convention as Edger-Jones Noa finds herself in a whole new world when she begins dating Stan's charismatic doctor Steve.",/review/rw7974202/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2022,Nevergivea10,7," Not a comedy
","First of all, there is not a single minute of this movie that would classify it as a comedy. It is a dark and disturbing suspense/horror movie.",/review/rw7974202/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2022,sweidman-28016,7," Entertaining Debut
","Fresh depicts the horrors of modern dating seen through one young woman's defiant battle to survive her new boyfriend's unusual appetites. This movie goes pretty off the rails and for good reason. Writer Lauryn Kahn is no stranger to rom-coms having several flops in the past. For this feature, she toys around with the horror genre to give a unique perspective both taken literally and metaphorically. The first 30-minutes are setup like a pleasing romantic movie. I quite enjoyed that beginning. Daisy Edgar-Jones and Sebastian Stan have a cute relationship and great chemistry, which lasts throughout. After that first half hour, the movie starts to pick up and show a darker side. In fact, the opening credits don't happen until then. What comes next is absurd and chilling. Without Mimi Cave's direction, her feature debut fun fact, I doubt the movie would work. She makes this both an uncomfortable and entertaining watch all together. Her techniques may not all be foreign to the horror genre and it definitely can be predictable at times, yet I feel she pulls it off.",/review/rw7974202/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2022,jtindahouse,9," Works on every level
",'Fresh' explores one of my greatest fears. Ever since I saw a particular scene in 'Hostel: Part 2' the concept has really bothered me. I won't say what it is because the surprise element is one of the great things this movie has going for it. All I'll say is it bothered me greatly.,/review/rw7974202/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,msbreviews,8," FRESH is an unforgettably shocking start to another Sundance Film Festival, holding all of the characteristics to end up as one of the absolute favorites.

10 April 2022,kosmasp,8," Exciting ... she's so exciting/inviting to me
","You may also think of the Kool & the Gang song when you hear the word Fresh. But the movie has nothing to do with the song - well not in a traditional sense. I reckon if you have a twisted mind (which is not a bad thing to have, if you want to enjoy this twisted movie - see what I did there?), you may see some connections.",/review/rw7974202/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,julieshotmail,5," I like the two lead actors but this is just silly
","Daisy Edgar-Jones of ""Normal People"" fame and Sebastian Stan currently portraying Tommy Lee in ""Pam & Tommy"" have cemented themselves as favorites in my book, so just seeing their names attached to this project turns this into a must-see. Furthermore, the premise description and trailer are respectful enough not to give out spoilers, and instead the movie actually goes out of its way to keep the mystery until about 50 minutes into the story. When it gets going though, it's all silly, full of contrived moments. However, the one specific revenge act is quite satisfying to watch, I must admit. Overall this is a mixed bag, which you can actually follow along by just having it playing in the background while doing something else.",/review/rw7974202/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2022,ChrisBeaken,4," Fresh
","This film presents itself as a basic romantic comedy that deteriorates into a dark comedic thriller. What could have been an intriguing horror, however, sadly proves to be just as basic as the premise it begins with. Although the cast does well with what they are given, the most interesting characters are not fully illustrated, creating a missed opportunity to study the characters and their mindsets. This film attempts to be an homage to psychological horror films but lacks the screen presence and insightful characters to do so. The tone is inconsistent, with serious issues being portrayed horrifyingly real while having the killer be over-the-top in his execution. The cinematography while at times spectacular also has a basic look to it that makes the film feel cheap and generic. The film also recycles plot elements of better-executed films, making this one feel lost in the mix. By no means is this an abomination to cinema, but because of its generic characteristics, lacks the elements to feel memorable, creating an overall missed opportunity of an intriguing concept.",/review/rw7974202/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2022,Eggoreluckadman,7," Enjoyable thriller
","The ending is a bit rushed and the third act is slower compared to the second and first, but with good performances, captivating cinematography and solid direction, Fresh culminates into an enjoyable thriller.",/review/rw7974202/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2022,andrewchristianjr,8," FRESH.
","Got me wondering whether this really happens irl (probably does). Sebastian Stan and Daisy Edgar-Jones had amazing chemistry that got me rooting for them to get together in the end. The ending gave me great satisfaction though. Overall, Fresh is an amazing thriller that sends a message to not be dumb and use your brain if you want to live.",/review/rw7974202/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2022,A_Different_Drummer,4," cognitive dissonance
","Quite the wild ride but not necessarily the ride you might expect. The first half hour, before the titles (!), promises a romcom as good or better than the A-list Hollywood stuff. Then we abruptly segue into a horror/tortureporn story without any real warning. The only really scary thing here is the realization that the producers of the film are not treating cannibalism simply as a mental illness, like HANNIBAL for eg, they are in fact glorifying it. THAT should keep you up at night! By Act III it is clear the budget and the creativity ran out at the same time, and suddenly all you are watching is a bad indie with nowhere to hide.",/review/rw7974202/?ref_=tt_urv
