28 April 2004,MovieAddict2016,7," Maybe you have to be a movie buff to ""get it""?
","To some people, movies are more than a passion. They are a way of life. For me, movies are not only one of my favorite hobbies, but I feel that all films express a certain reflection of the individual watching them. They say that you can tell a lot from a person by the way they act, talk, walk. I believe you can also tell a lot about a person from the sort of movies they like. ",/review/rw0380223/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2000,darkjosh,8," One of Carrey's Best Performances
","When first released, Cable Guy was such an unusual departure for Jim Carrey and his usual slapstick, manic, goofy comedies that people just didn't understand it or like it.  When word of Carrey's enormous $20 million paycheck for this film spread, hopes were high that Cable Guy would be smothered in Carrey's slice of hilarious dementia to the extreme.",/review/rw0380223/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2020,UniqueParticle,10," Cult classic, definitely underrated and hilarious
","I love this movie so much! So cute how Leslie Mann and Judd Apatow fell in love during the filming. In the prime of Jim Carrey with quirkiness that is glorious throughout. Regardless of being a movie buff this should be enjoyable for most anyone, warms my heart and makes me smile. Perfectly wild entertainment that never ceases to amaze me!",/review/rw0380223/?ref_=tt_urv

25 July 2004,Stevieheuge,8," A Different Slant...
","The Cable Guy has now all but been forgotten by the movie world. It was released when Jim Carrey was on his way to being the new A list comedian, and thus, was considered only a slightly funny version of 'Ace Venture'. or The Mask' Or whatever. Personally, I don't consider The Cable Guy a comedy at all. Sure, there are some side splitting moments - Carrey is hilarious alongside Matthew Broderick's by the numbers 'average Joe', but id suggest that anyone who was not taken in by this film to look at it a little differently...",/review/rw0380223/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2004,baehr76,," Hidden Comedy
","Regardless of what people say, this movie has some very funny moments scattered throughout. When I first saw this movie, I will admit I didn't find it that funny. But it's one of those movies that grows on you with time. Even if you don't like it at first, give it some time. You have to accept this movie for what it is. A dark comedy aimed at poking fun of the lighter things in life. Jim Carrey obviously carries the movie with his infamous quirkiness, but Matthew Broderick holds his own as the anal retentive guy which he is great at playing. Whether you are talking about the Midevil Times restaurant scene or the karaoke scene, this movie is a gem. Highly recommended.",/review/rw0380223/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2022,IonicBreezeMachine,8," A darker turn from Jim Carrey that was unfairly maligned in its day
","Following a failed marriage proposal to his girlfriend, Robin (Leslie Mann), architect Steven Kovacs (Matthew Broderick) moves into an apartment to reluctantly setup his single existence. Dealing with movers and waiting for The Cable Guy, he finally arrives in the form of eccentric Ernie ""Chip"" Douglas (Jim Carrey). On the advice of his best friend Rick (Jack Black), Steven asks Chip about a deal of slipping him $40 in exchange for full cable access which Chip agrees. Chip initiates friendship with Steven, who reluctantly accepts but as Chip ingrains himself more and more in Steven's life Steven gives him an ultimatum to leave him alone which doesn't go over well with Chip.",/review/rw0380223/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2004,mr_maximus-1,10," watch it again. highly underrated
","the most astonishing thing about the cable guy is that it simply wasn't liked by critics! however, this was to be expected given the way it was promoted. Not just another Jim Carrey ""stupid humour"" movie as it was unfortuanately promoted as, the cable guy was an entirely different genre; a comedy so dark it bordered on horror/thriller. and it is utterly brilliant.",/review/rw0380223/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2007,ametaphysicalshark,," Carrey's best comedic performance, and a terrific dark comedy
","Jim Carrey has only been better than this in two movies, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", and ""Man on the Moon"", but both were more or less dramatic roles. Aside from the classic ""Dumb and Dumber"", none of his comedy roles can even begin to compare to his superb, electric performance here. Most people I know don't really enjoy this, but that's because they can't really relate, or they don't want to. Carrey plays 'Chip Douglas' (which might be his real name, or it might not), a Cable Guy brought up on TV and movies. His performance works so well because he normally goes too far with his antics, making himself seem annoying on occasion, rather than funny. Here, he plays a lunatic, so there are no limits for him to adhere to, and where he would normally seem over the top (the Medieval Times sequence), he is genuinely hilarious.",/review/rw0380223/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2004,Guardia,9," The Future is Now...
","This movie is one of Jim Carrey most perfectly crafted. His subtle style slipped through the cracks after his horribly obnoxious endeavours in both Ace Ventura and The Mask (but they were funny too). He actually addressed this phenomena in a SNL sketch, where in his opening monologue a fat guy in the front row refuses to laugh at any of the jokes except his trade-mark lines i.e. ""Sssssssmokin'!"", or ""Alllllllrighty-then!"", or ""Le-hooo... -zeherr"", and so on. This sort of attitude continued onto the Truman Show set, where none of the crew were allowed to comment on any other of his ""meatball"" sort of films. Ahhh boy.",/review/rw0380223/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2018,benjaminweber,10," Carrey at his hilariously sinister best
","This is the perfect Jim Carrey film: a comedy, but also a horror film with a more serious message at its heart. ",/review/rw0380223/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2004,georgejo,," I liked it
","Some people really hated the movie. I saw it, I'll note I saw it on video and frankly I loved it. I think this was the start of Carrey really coming out although it has a couple of crude jokes I could have done without. You really feel for Broderick who starts out having a slightly annoying friend and ends up dealing with a stalker! Somehow the stalker goes from being exceedingly annoying to outsiders gaining acceptance from everybody around his victim. He casts a spell having his victim believe that he is in danger of losing everything if he does not co-operate with his tomentor. Anyway, if you like a bit of light dark comedy and order a pizza, I think the movie is worth a watch.",/review/rw0380223/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2019,eric262003,8," Shows a Darker Side To Jim Carrey's Manic Ways
","Even at the most absurd movies to come out, Jim Carrey still can find ways to make them all the more plausible. Before landing a role in ""The Cable Guy"", Carrey's movies were surrealistically cartoon-like nonsense like ""The Mask"", ""Dumb and Dumber"" and the ""Ace Ventura"" films. But now with age and experience, it is great that Carrey was trying out new films and new angles so he wouldn't be regarded as a one-trick pony. ""The Cable Guy"" still has Carrey playing out his usual over-the-top elastic man persona, but here he's now taking his act in more serious and at time darker territories. It's also very well balanced that the straight-guy character was played to effectiveness from Matthew Broderick as his foil.",/review/rw0380223/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2005,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,8," Laugh-out-loud, on-the-floor hilarious film!
","In my opinion, THE CABLE GUY is a laugh-out-loud, on-the-floor hilarious film! When the cable guy (Jim Carrey) sang ""Somebody To Love,"" I laughed really hard. One thing I couldn't stand about him was his lisp. Also, he just couldn't seem to leave Steven (Matthew Broderick) alone. If my cable guy was like that, I'd get a restraining order. When the cable guy whispered a part of a woman's body when he and Steven's family played ""Password,"" I was really grossed out! In addition, Robin (Leslie Mann) was a very beautiful woman... especially in the clothing she wore when she went out on dates. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""Be careful who you trust. Also, find out if your cable guy is really a cable guy."" Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this laugh-out-loud, on-the-floor hilarious film to all you Jim Carrey fans who have not seen it.",/review/rw0380223/?ref_=tt_urv

25 November 2005,lee_eisenberg,7," Under-appreciated
","When ""The Cable Guy"" first came out, it flopped and most people considered it sort of lowly. But I immediately found it impressive - if dark - and I hope that in years to come, more people will. The plot of course has bummed-out everyman Steven Kovacs (Matthew Broderick) getting cable installed by a TV-raised cable guy (Jim Carrey). After that, the cable guy starts treating Steven to many things, apparently wanting to be friends. But then, it turns out that he wants to be more than friends. And he's not taking no for an answer.",/review/rw0380223/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2019,dylankraft91,10," Criminally Underrated
","Many would say this film was ahead of it's time, released in the wrong decade even. Jim Carrey can always make you laugh with a simple frantic flailing of his limbs, but this time he's somehow out done himself. Out acted. Out crafted. Out witted. The dynamic between Jim and Matt Broderick mirrors perfection in every way possible. Also, It's the perfect movie to trip on acid or mushrooms to. It's hilarious at all the right moments, and settles down when you need to relax yourself and catch your breath... which, if you're tripping, you probably won't need to much. The amount of hate towards this movie is not only a crime, but a true tragedy.",/review/rw0380223/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2016,clacura,9," Excellent...but must remember time period
","The reason this movie did not do as well or Carrey was slammed was because he came off the very kiddie friendly Ace Ventura, Dumb and Dumber, Batman and The Mask. Now that will start anyone's career off to a blazing start! What was Jim's audience expecting? More silly comedy. Parents take their kids to The Cable Guy (title fits a dumb silly JC comedy) and wonder what is going on here! This is a movie for today's kids, not back in 96. That is why this movie holds up so well. It is an adult dark comedy.",/review/rw0380223/?ref_=tt_urv

11 October 2001,Howlin Wolf,4," The movie is as schizophrenic as its main character... (SPOILERS)
","""The Cable Guy"" can never decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a drama, a thriller, or a social satire. Not enough of the comedy is funny, or of the same type; any attempt at drama is undercut because of the annoying lisping of Carrey's character, and the movie is never particularly thrilling because we don't care about any of the characters. The one small area where the movie succeeds is in its satire. Even here the points made have a slight whiff of familiarity about them. Whilst the one thing ""The Cable Guy"" can never reasonably be accused of is unoriginality, the theme that TV can be a corrupting influence is hardly groundbreaking insight.",/review/rw0380223/?ref_=tt_urv
