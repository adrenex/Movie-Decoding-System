6 June 2002,capkronos,9," This is a fine, fine film.
","I guess different people can extract different meanings from GHOST WORLD and all nail exactly why it was made. For me, it was the chronicle of that small group of people who don't, and probably never will, quite fit into this world. They're here on the fringes though, just existing in their own parallel universe, or their own ""ghost world."" Though it sounds depressing, this film is hardly a downer, it's full of humor, satire and acute observations on life. The overall production is excellent (the brightness and colors in the photography, costumes and sets is stunning)... plus it pulls off the impossible by successfully steering toward dead-on seriousness near the conclusion to drive it's point across.",/review/rw1729265/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2002,moonspinner55,7," Deadpan comic revulsion
","Two female high school grads plan to get jobs and hang together, but bonds become frayed and paths separate after one of the girls ends up on an unintended journey of self-discovery. From the comic-book which takes a perverse delight in celebrating the geeky side of all of us, ""Ghost World"" is profane and cynical, but also surprisingly blithe and bright. I rather enjoyed it but realize it's not for every taste. Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson are incredibly rich and vivid in their roles (low-keyed, deadpan, but not blanks); their love-hate friendship is convincing and blessedly free of melodramatics--even they seem to cherish the personality conflicts that come up, it may give them more ammunition. As for the ending, I'm not sure whether it is ingenious or a cop-out, but it did leave me touched (in a bemused, nostalgic way). A movie with much to offer. *** from ****",/review/rw1729265/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2019,FrenchEddieFelson,8," Adorable advocacy on the end of adolescence and the anti-conformism
","For a few weeks, the daily life of Rebecca and Enid, two teenagers who spend their time complaining and pesting, with a decided opinion on almost everything, without any diplomatic filter. One could almost think they were educated in France, at least partially. Thus, following their 4381st perfidy of the week, they meet Seymour, a lonely middle-aged music aficionado. Surprisingly, in contact with Seymour, Enid discovers the concept of benevolence. Despite the 25-year gap, they seem connected with real affinities. In fact, the film takes place at a time when Rebecca and Enid have just graduated from high school, and what seemed to be gratuitous malice is probably more an uncontrolled anger based on the fear of leaving their adolescence to join a world they hardly appreciate: the adult society. They fear to grow up and move on. In a way, Seymour was a transition or a key milestone for Enid: the perfect guy, at the perfect time. Thanks to Seymour, Enid has matured and learned to live differently, with a significantly more open mind. The world does not revolves anymore around herself: she is now part of it. Time to take a bus to discover it! Like Jules Winnfield said during the coffee shop conversation, within ",/review/rw1729265/?ref_=tt_urv

Enid and her best friend, Rebecca (a 15 year-old Scarlett Johansson) discuss how much they longed for their graduation day, and when it finally came, it wasn't as cheerful as they were expecting. While Rebecca finds a job and tries to move on, Enid doesn't know what to do with her life and spends most of her time with Seymour (Steve Buscemi, playing the most humane variation of all the 'losers' he's been playing his whole life, and that's why he's so great at it), a lonely older man whose biggest pleasure is collecting rare, old records.",/review/rw1729265/?ref_=tt_urv

11 June 2002,JHollis,9," Mature, intelligent and haunting (but in a good way)
","Movies that criticise the world can fall into many traps, leaving the viewer to feel jaded by the film's experience.  Ghost World's witty appraisal of 'America' successfully avoids being childishly caustic or self-important and thus emerges as one of the best films of 2001. We sympathise with Enid (the luscious Thora Birch) without being expected to completely believe that her cynical world-view is necessarily the right one. Enid's (and her best-friend Rebecca's)negativity is turned on all around them, and their obsessive need to be cool but on their own terms sees them take post-modernism to its absurd conclusion.",/review/rw1729265/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2004,tfrizzell,," Walking Through Your Life As Nothing Else Moves.
","Two high school outcasts (Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson) graduate and it appears that the duo will continue to be best friends. They seek out work and a place to live, but before that they go around and make fun of seemingly everyone around them. The situations are quirky and hilarious, but soon they pull a prank on a lonely man (Steve Buscemi) that leaves Birch feeling sorry for the stranger. Thus Birch, with Johansson in tow, decide to meet Buscemi and the results are mixed at best. However the strangest of relationships starts as Birch makes it a goal to find a woman that Buscemi can date. Meanwhile Johansson accepts what she must do and starts to work at a local Starbucks. Birch, totally unsure of what she wants to do with her life (both personally and professionally), begins to drift away from her best friend just as Buscemi finds a woman he likes (Stacy Travis). Oddly Birch becomes jealous of this development and does her best to keep Buscemi single and miserable (like herself obviously). Birch struggles through with all this plus a home-life that she dislikes as her father (the priceless Bob Balaban) starts to re-create a relationship with a woman that she has always hated (the uncredited Teri Garr in a short cameo). She also spends her days taking a remedial art class so she can indeed finalize her high school diploma. ""Ghost World"" is an immensely interesting experience as Birch (best known for ""American Beauty"") and Johansson (who is an amazing young talent, just think ""Lost in Translation"") are totally believable as youngsters with quiet angst and sadness issues. Their slow divergence as the film progresses is a hard thing to view because you know that neither want that. Buscemi is amazing as a loner who mirrors the two youngsters (Birch in particular). Co-writers Terry Zwigoff (who also directed) and Daniel Clowes received Oscar nominations for a script that was actually adapted from a comic book (no kidding). This is a wonderfully smart and poignant black comedy that is arguably the best production from the teen genre. It is to the 2000s what ""Rebel Without a Cause"" was to the 1950s and what ""American Graffiti"" was to the 1970s. There are also shades of Bob Rafelson's ""Five Easy Pieces"" here. An under-rated and exceptional gem. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",/review/rw1729265/?ref_=tt_urv

","Terry Zwigoff has created an excellent parable about disaffected youth in ""Ghost World"". The character of Enid (memorably played by Thora Birch) is a sardonic iconoclast, and a bit of a hero to me. She has her own style, speaks her razor sharp mind, and truly doesn't care what people think about her. Picture a female, proactive version of Holden Caulfield.

14 July 2002,jamesdeanstolemyturkey,," it seems, from other reviews on this page, this is a widely misunderstood film
","A significant number of reviews I have read regarding Ghost World complain about ""nothing"" happening.  This is simply untrue.  Having read the book by Daniel Clowes and being sceptical and admiring of it in roughly equal measure, I was very pleased to see the film far surpassed the book in excellence.  Another book that can be likened to Ghost World is The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger, and even The Graduate shares themes with Ghost World.  The narrative revolves in all three around characters who have reached a juncture in their life where the road splits many different ways, causing confusion.",/review/rw1729265/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2021,nickenchuggets,8," ""I can't relate to 99 percent of humanity""
","Ghost World is a good example of a recent movie that manages to have a complex storyline reminiscent of things I am familiar with, such as noir. This doesn't mean it counts as that, but I was a little surprised after seeing it because the plot has numerous twists and turns to it. At first glance, the movie didn't seem like something I would enjoy taking a look at, for the sole reason of it being about a pair of high school graduates. The movie describes high school as ""training wheels for the bicycle of real life"", which is a downright laughable statement, for me anyway. Almost nothing I learned the whole time I was there is applicable in adulthood. Regardless, the high school aspect of this movie is only really visible in the first few minutes, and no mention of it is made afterward. It's largely irrelevant to the story, but at least it does let you know the main characters are finished with mandatory education. Ghost World, as stated earlier, focuses on two girls who have recently graduated, Enid and Rebecca (Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson respectively) and the various problems that they come across in the modern world. Technically, this is a comedy movie, but the humor is so deadpan and laced with expletives that most people will not find it all that funny. Still, there are some exceptions. The movie starts with Enid and Rebecca graduating high school and are left wondering how to best spend their upcoming summer. They both come to the conclusion that they need a source of income and search around for various way to make money. This is difficult for them because they're both basically loners and find it difficult to form relationships with average people. Enid also resents the fact that her friend is more attractive than her in the eyes of local boys. To make things worse, Enid learns she has to attend school even in the summer for failing an art class. Later, the girls learn about a guy named Seymour (Steve Buscemi) who enjoys collecting old records and decide to visit him. Enid buys a record from him and they start to talk to each other more and more. Unbeknownst to him though, Enid's friend Josh has been making fun of him behind his back. Because she's antisocial, Enid finds a unique interest in Seymour because he essentially has her same mindset. He fills his life with material possessions because he can't relate to anyone. While this is going on, Enid shows up at her remedial art class, which is very awkward to watch. The students make various pieces of ""art"" and bring them in for examination. One depicts someone smashing another person's head with a large hammer, and the teacher remarks she thought it was supposed to represent the kid's father. After visiting Seymour's house again, Enid comes across an antique painting he owns, which is a racist caricature made into a logo for a chicken restaurant chain. Realizing she's taking a big risk by doing this, Enid decides to borrow it and bring it to her art class. The other students are understandably shocked, but Roberta (the teacher) likes it because she thinks it's a commentary on racism. This is where Enid's fortune really takes a turn for the worse. Seymour (on Enid's advice) starts seeing a girl named Dana, who says she doesn't like Laurel and Hardy movies because the ""fat one is always mean to the skinny one."" Enid is now envious because she's not the woman in Seymour's relationship. Rebecca's efforts to find a job finally pay off, which means she and Enid can no longer spend as much time together. In a way, this turns them against each other. Then comes a final blow. Enid's teacher takes it upon herself to display the caricature Enid took from Seymour's house at a local art show, and people are so offended by it that Roberta is forced to give Enid an F for the class. Not only that, but her promised scholarship goes out the window. All this bad luck and misfortune forces Enid to return to Seymour's house, even though she told him not to call her ever again. Seymour opts to let Enid stay with him, which requires him excluding Dana from his life. He also discovers from Rebecca that Enid drew crude, mocking images of him in a book she owns. Enraged, he drives to the store where Enid's friend works and tries to assault him, but is attacked and hospitalized. Enid goes there to tell him she is sorry, and informs him the later pages of the book depict him in a much more positive way. He just happened to skip over them. At the end, Enid sees a man we have been introduced to earlier in the movie. His name is Norman, and he waits on a bench for a bus that is out of service. Somehow, a bus suddenly shows up and he steps on. Enid goes to where he was previously waiting, gets on a second bus, and it drives away. Quite a complicated movie which a strange and mysterious ending. Many have theorized as to what the ending means, but in my opinion, it's an allegory for killing oneself. Towards the end, Enid has all these bad things happen to her, and can't seem to get a break. She even inadvertently ruins Seymour's relationship with Dana. She feels like nobody wants her around or likes her, so I think the ending implies she is dead. This would make sense considering the title of the movie. Ghost World was directed by Terry Zwigoff, who also did the dark and humorous documentary on the life of Robert Crumb in 1994. Ghost World shares many similarities with that film, since they both feature a strong presence of dry humor and laughing at other people's expense. Crumb is also involved in this movie because the drawings of Seymour in Enid's book resemble his style greatly. To summarize, Ghost World is a strange and somewhat depressing movie to watch. There are lots of moments in it that just make me cringe to the point of not wanting to continue watching, simply because they're a little too relatable. A good instance of this is when Seymour is talking to Enid at a diner, and Dana appears suddenly, causing him to spill his drink on himself. I've been in too many situations like that and it hurts to watch. There's also a post credit scene that shows Seymour actually winning the fight he has in the store against Enid's friend and the manager. The acting and dialogue in this movie is also quite good, even if it is meant to make the audience feel extremely self-conscious. Thora Birch as Enid resembles me in many respects because she can't seem to get along with many people and prefers to be alone. Scarlett Johansson is a lot more sociable than her counterpart, which ends up making Enid jealous and annoyed. Steve Buscemi here reminds me a lot of various people I know who are into the business of collecting things nobody seems to want, such as old books or cameras. He's also probably the funniest character because it doesn't take much to set him off. To summarize, Ghost World is not what I would consider a groundbreaking movie, but it is entertaining at least. My main gripe with it is that it was so difficult to watch because the fights, confrontations, and arguments the characters get into are too relatable.",/review/rw1729265/?ref_=tt_urv

","I liked this movie very much, not so much while watching (we were expecting more of a comedy), but upon reflecting that night. To me, ""Ghost World,"" the title, refers to a world that's no longer alive to the main characters, especially Enid, though also to a lesser degree Rebecca and Seymour. Enid's life is no in longer in the world in which she has grown up, certainly not with her father, and not being carried along with the mainstream thoughtlessness and a lock-step life (e.g., just going to college cause everyone else does). But neither is the plan she long shared with Rebecca -- working in a whatever-type job and living independently -- working out.

","this movie caught my attention when i was 14. i was going through an amazingly difficult time in my life, and this movie changed my view on everything. i had not read the graphic novel or even really heard about this film, which my mother rented and to be honest i looked at it and judged it as another stupid chick flick i didn't care to see. but my mum wanted to watch it, so i decided to sit down with her. from the first scene overlooking middle class America it struck me, as a well made movie. the character Enid, was almost a mirror image of how i was feeling at the time, and now when i watch it i almost see her as selfish, but i still feel a lot of emotions for her. now i see myself as Seymour (played by the amazing Steve Buscemi) me, myself being a somewhat excessive compulsive collector (of film not 78 records) and also not being able to get on with 95% of humanity. Terry Zwigoff is a master director who i believe deserves a lot more credit than he gets. this movie captures not just female teenage life, but teenage life wonderfully. i actually have a tattoo of this movie it means so much to me, i love it and always will have a special spot in my heart. i watch it twice a year and i don't get sick of it, in fact i pick up more every viewing.
