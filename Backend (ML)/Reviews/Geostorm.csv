","Hollywood studio boss: ""Okay, folks, I want you to use everything that's been going through the global press for the last two years: Occupational disasters, storms, climate change. Just mix it together like a salad. And because my son has just turned twelve, I want this film to be dedicated only to twelve-year-old males. Okay, my son is not the brightest and he loves explosions and space ships - preferably exploding space ships - so make something he'll like for sure. Blow something up and stuff like that.""

16 February 2019,lee_eisenberg,1," Can some natural disaster deal with the people who make these movies?
","Dean Devlin produced the likes of ""Independence Day"" and ""Godzilla"", so his directorial debut is a similar movie. ""Geostorm"" wants to see itself as an environmental movie, but it's the sort of flick that belongs on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". Indeed, the YouTube series CinemaSins points out everything wrong with it. Just avoid it.",/review/rw3829634/?ref_=tt_urv

",Bad science. Bad plot. Bad script. Bad acting. Why would anyone sign up to be a part of this disaster?,/review/rw3829634/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2020,kosmasp,5," CGI good, movie not so good
","And when I say good, I don't mean like excellent. But it's good, you should not be offended by it. I never watched this in the cinema, where I guess the movie might have impacted some people more than others. I don't even want to go near a comparisson with Jurassic Park (way better handled overall as a movie), but when it comes to story vs. technical achievements, there are similarities ... also when it comes to what you consider to help like a movie more or less.",/review/rw3829634/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2018,SnoopyStyle,3," frustratingly stupid without the campy fun
",An international team led Jake Lawson (Gerard Butler) creates a global network of satellites to ameliorate the deteriorating weather. The system called Dutch Boy is controlled by a group of scientists from the massive International Space Station. Politicians push aside Jake and install his brother Max (Jim Sturgess) as the new leader with the UN set to take over from the US in 3 years. It's 3 years later and unexplained errors occur. Max recruits his estranged brother Jake to investigate any design problems on the space station.,/review/rw3829634/?ref_=tt_urv

31 May 2018,doc2120,3," Before Watching, remove Brain and put on table
","All I can say is... WOW. I truly Hope Gerard Butler, Andy garcia, and Ed Harris were able to buy their additional vacation houses or pay off IRS with this CGI poopfest!! It reminded me of those cheesy 80's action flicks with the horrible one-liners, yet this lacked any of the charm. If you ARE going to watch this, I highly suggest watching it in a group, while you're all high, and straight Mystery's science Theather this thing!",/review/rw3829634/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2019,JessaKat18,," Whattttt!? How did this get low ratings?
",Man I thought this movie was great! Had tons of action and I enjoyed the story. Not sure why other users gave this such low ratings. I say give this movie a chance!,/review/rw3829634/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2017,joshualawrencepike,7," Not bad if you ignore the science
","Just to get it out of the way the science on Geostorm is... not good. It reminds me of The Core or Armageddon. You just have to accept it and move on, I feel it unjust to judge the movie on something that they obviously put little emphasis on. ",/review/rw3829634/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2021,turdymac,7," People just forget what movies are
","This film is Science Fiction. Let me repeat..SCIENC FICTION. I thought it was entertaining. However, I see other ""critics"" basing their opinions on the fact that this film was too fake, bad science. Seriously? Look, if you look for realism in film, stop watching film. If you look for realism in science fiction films then don't watch Alien (or it's sequels), Avatar, Terminator, Ghostbusters, 2010...in fact, stop watching science fiction movies all together. Read biographies. My opinion, this movie was entertaining. Nothing more. A good time waist like any other science fiction film. People have to stop looking into syfy for some deep meaning or realism otherwise it makes no sense to even watch them. They're not called science fact films people. It's about imagination.",/review/rw3829634/?ref_=tt_urv

26 October 2017,matiasbravojara,2," One of the worst movies I've seen in years
",I went to see Geostorm because it was the only movie playing on a night where I really wanted to go to the 4D-cinema. Since it was a disaster movie I figured it would go well with the big screen and the 4D-effects.,/review/rw3829634/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2019,pmtelefon,3," Too dumb to be enjoyed.
","I knew when I sat down to watch ""Geostorm"" that I was going to be watching a preachy propaganda movie. That's fine. It wouldn't be the first one that I've seen. I wanted to see ""Geostorm"" not for its politics but because it's a disaster movie. Disaster movies are one of my favorite movie genres. Unfortunately, it doesn't succeed at either one of those types of film. It's story is so poorly told that I lost all interest in any point it was trying to make. The disaster parts of the movie weren't very interested either. The cast seems to have been thrown together at the last minute. Some of the ""names"" didn't have much to do. They cast members that did have things to do didn't hit the ball out of the park with their performances. The special effects were okay. I wish I saw this movie in 3D. ""Geostorm"" plays like a sub-par SYFY network movie but not nearly as fun. Dishonorable mention: Gerard Butler.",/review/rw3829634/?ref_=tt_urv

12 October 2017,phd_travel,3," More of a disaster than a disaster movie
",This disaster movie starts off with good intentions with a warning about what climate change can do. We get little snippets of disaster weather wreaking havoc in cities. Then a tedious conspiracy theory plays out on earth and in a space station that regulates the weather that is going haywire. The disaster scenes seem short and TV movie like - surprising from director of Independence Day. There is a cheap feel about them. Snippets of disaster interspersed between tedious stretches. The subsequent car chase exploding space station and weather calamities all at once is just too much at the same time. Quality over quantity ought to have been in the minds of the film makers. There is a grand climax but in the end this will probably go down as one of the lesser disaster movies.,/review/rw3829634/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2017,BuddyBoy60,7," Despite familiar tropes, Geostorm is surprisingly timely, entertaining and with a lot of heart.
","In Geostorm, Earth is beset by natural disasters. In facing adversity, mankind developed a satellite station to prevent these catastrophes. While people overcame this problem, another conflict arises when it becomes opportune to use the technology as a weapon for sole global domination.",/review/rw3829634/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2017,Fujiko-san,2," Disaster is correct
","When the movie ended, the 8 year old behind me said, ""Thats the end? Mom, they didn't show the Geostorm!"" and I kid you not, he started to cry. ",/review/rw3829634/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2017,abisio,9," A very decent thriller on a sci-fi background disguised as a disaster movie
",First of all do not be fooled by the trailers; GEOSTORM is really a thriller on quite believable SCI-FI scenario. An international space / satellite based system created for control climate and to avoid the impeding disaster of global warming. After a successful launch; government officials take control of the system firing the project head. Three years later accidents start to happen killing many people so the main scientist is convoked and sent back for an audit. It does not requires a lot of thinking to understand there is a conspiracy somewhere and that one of those old but great actors must be the culprit. In any case; the movie pace never slows down to let you think about the obvious and to stop being entertaining.,/review/rw3829634/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2017,danielcalegari,1," Worst disaster movie of 2017
","THERE IS NO GEOSTORM! Only a family drama and bad acting, some nice CGI effects about tornados at Asia, tsunami on Dubai (shit), cool climate changes at Rio de Janeiro (who are those people there? they don't look Brazilians), a lovely drama about a couple working at government, the conspiracy government that is not fault of the great president of that great united states of America (terrorists are always from other countries).
