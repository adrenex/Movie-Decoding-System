11 February 2019,plargreg,1," do you like butt kissing?
",Jimmy fallon isnt fun or funny HES SO FAKE! also he was the weakest link on snl when he was there how did he get his own talk show? because on weekend update tina carried him 100% GARBAGE SHOW,/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2019,chiguy17,1," Just not funny
","I never understood how Fallon got the gig. When he was on SNL, he was the least talented of the cast, and couldn't even stay in character for a full skit. I've accidentally tuned into his version of the Tonight Show just because I was already watching NBC, and just shocked at how unfunny he is. The only thing I can think of is that they're going for a super young audience (which doesn't make sense in the late night crowd).",/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2019,plargreg,1," Jimmy isn't funny
",HOW CAN JIMMY FALLON CANCEL NORM MACDONALD WHAT A WIMP! way to defend yer fellow snl comedy roots you dork instead lets watch two b list celebrities try and make each other laugh over some lame party games instead of having an actual funny person on,/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2019,Sober-Friend,1," Fire Higgins and get rid of the games
",I have given this show plenty of chances to improve and it doesn't it get s worse. From the increasing annoying Steve (Greasy) Higgins and his stupid games its a chore to finish and most of the time when it goes into a commercial breaks in the 2nd half I fall asleep. If you watch the 2nd half there is a real long string of commercials. There is 5 minutes then a quick promo from Jimmy then another 5 minutes.,/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2015,jmcd2007,3," ""The Tonight Show"" without class
","To sum it all into perspective, I cannot stand Fallon. I tried watching a couple of episodes of his version of ""The Tonight Show"" but just couldn't go on. Carson would be rolling in his grave. Whatever class ""The Tonight Show"" once had is now gone and has been replaced by immature tomfoolery. What probably annoys me the most about Fallon is his over-emphasized laughter over the littlest things and the worshiping of his guests, which is absolutely atrocious and unnecessary. These things make him look immature, fake, and desperate for the attention and ratings. Although some of his games aren't bad, his monologues are weak...but nowhere near as bad as Letterman's, whose monologues and humor are about as dry as a desert. Anyhow, Fallon's house band, The Roots, also look like they were picked out of an alley from the 1970s. The set and furniture are bland, and so is Fallon's brand of humor. If you like toilet humor and other jokes that you'd probably hear in a middle school hallway, then this show is for you. Furthermore, if you like a ""host"" that lollygags around the set while barely giving his guests enough time to talk during an ""interview,"" then this show is for you. Many of the once great hosts of late-night have either retired or are starting to wear out their welcome. For instance, although I was glad to hear that Letterman finally decided to retire, I cringe at the fact that someone like Stephen Colbert will be taking over for him come May 2015. Kimmel isn't bad, but could be better. Late night is dead, folks, and NBC just helped put another nail in the coffin here.",/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2015,duraflex,3," No longer watching the TONIGHT SHOW
",Jimmy Fallon has a modicum of talent and can pull off some funny bits but hosting the 60 minute TONIGHT SHOW 5 nights a week is obviously more than he can handle. He seems like an okay guy but he's an example of The Peter Principle in play.,/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2017,stanheckjr,1," Steve Higgins Is Too Weird
",The Tonight Show needs an overhaul! The shows host acts like a drunk frat boy and his sidekick (Steve Higgins) is weird & not funny. Jimmy Fallan also has these stupid games he plays with his guest and they are boring to watch.,/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2016,ShadeofMisery,1," He would be great if he can just stop talking all the time.
","Fallon is that kind of a friend who always needs to have the last word on everything. Like, if a topic comes up he just happens to know something about it or has to say something because he wants people to know that he's so smart and worldly and funny even though his facts are wrong. He's an okay, decent human being but I don't want to be around him for ten minutes.",/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2015,futurechange,1," Jimmy Fallon is annoying and childish
","I use to watch Letterman just because he was calm and grown up even if boring. I find Jimmy Fallon and his false sounding,extremely worded appreciation of every guest and their talent as about untruthful as I have ever seen. Most guests look so uncomfortable. His laughter is forced and false as if him laughing will make things that are not funny magically become so to the audience. ",/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2014,mohancraig,1," Dumbest host ever
","Even worse than Leno, is NBC allergic to real late night comedy? Who's funny? Craig Ferguson, Jimmy Kimmel, David Letterman, Stephen Colbert... even the watered down version of Conan Obrien on TBS is still funnier than the comedy bereft Fallon.",/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2019,brianyru,1," So much for maturity!
","Letterman was entertainment. Fallon is an immature child. He acts like a 12 year old. He has no business trying to entertain adults. He sounds insincere, disinterested, and forced when interviewing guests. The only time that he seems genuine is when he is doing stupid immature jokes or games that aren't any better than fart jokes. He is a child.",/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2019,bradfrick,1," Great show to fall asleep to....
",Because it's no longer funny and easy to ignore...,/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2014,afijamesy2k,," Fallon is not funny at all and the tonight show is no longer tonight.
","This is absolutely the most pathetic version of the tonight show I've ever seen, fallon is not funny and brings no distinct impression the way the late johnny Carson and jay Leno, the set is atrocious, the lines are funny, the musicians are pathetic, joan rivers look as lost as usual and everything else is plain trash, I Remember when I Was the tonight show with johnny Carson back in the day, he has charm, style and heart that most talk shows don't have (even arsenio hall has that), but this guy is not funny, embarrassing, he is a globalist left wing garbage filth, just like the neocons, their all on the same boat, Junk, this is the worst tonight show of the last 60 years and it's a shame, because Carson and Leno truly made the show for what it is, laughter, time and honesty.",/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2021,swhite_1119,1," How is this show still on
",People actually watch this. I hadn't seen any late night show in years and it came on after the news my remotes batteries died it took 3 minutes for me to get up and change it. Those were emerge worst if you want to call them jokes I've ever heard. No one can actually be that stupid to find this show entertaining.,/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2014,qormi,," Train Wreck...I give it 6 months at best
","Jimmy Fallon is absolutely talent-free. He is immature, awkward, and clueless. He's a 13 year old trapped in a 39 year old man's body. His monologues are so lousy as to make one uncomfortable...I even pity him at times. Whenever he interviews a guest, Fallon shamelessly kisses their butts like there's no tomorrow, eagerly giggling at everything they say. I believe NBC made a huge mistake in dumping Leno for this amateurish fool. I predict that once the ratings hit the cellar, NBC execs will look back on what made Leno Number One...talent and the ability to connect with people. Leno will be back hosting the Tonite Show by September...from beautiful downtown Burbank.",/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2018,rob_4,1," Where's Johnny?
",What was NBC thinking? Jimmy Fallon is not funny! It's an embarrassment to that great institution.Jay Leno did his best and actually paid homage to the show. Late night comedy is a thing of the past now. Nobody is funny.......only using their venue to spread hate.,/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2014,bushape1,2," Worst host ever of The Tonight Show
","My wife and I never like Jimmy Fallon. what is with the crap about reading those annoying cards? We never could understand that. Every host brings their own sense of humor and style. I just happen to not like Fallon's style. Even though Jay Leno left after screwing Conan out of The Tonight Show, I believe that NBC should of offered the job back to Conan instead of Fallon. Conan paid his dues at NBC and worked harder and longer at NBC than Fallon ever did. So I believe The Tonight Show should still be Conan's and I refuse to watch Jimmy Fallon. Maybe I am wrong but that is my choice. There is probably so much of behind the scenes that we don't see or even hear of. The ultimate decision will be made by the viewers.",/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2014,lfletch03,1," Poor Jimmy......a real snooze.
","I watched 10 or so shows, thinking Jimmy needed to ""warm up"". But the show is just terrible. It might be better without the loud mouth, obnoxious side kick. I have always liked Fallon and thought he'd do really well with this show but not so. I feel embarrassed for Jimmy. I don't care how you cut it; this show simply does not work for Jimmy. I agree with the reviewer who said something like: this is a teenager in a 39 year old's body. Monologues are corny and the skits are just horrific. I can't imagine what has happened to Jimmy. I just loved his humor but no more........not as a host anyway. He seems very awkward and unlike himself. I was really looking forward to the show as I never did warm up to Jay Leno....Jay repeated his jokes too much. I still love Jimmy Fallon but I feel very badly that he can't seem to carry this off. Like I said, it might be better if the sidekick is removed or replaced. Steve Higgins is SO loud and SO irritating. Sad, really sad !",/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2017,Hollywoodwhore99,2," Steve Higgins is too weird and annoying
","If you are under 50 you know miss the good old days of ""The Tonight Show"" with Johnny Carson. The ""Johnny Carson Era"" is the gold standard. When Jay Leno hosted it least we had more clever segments and a funny opening MONOLOGUE. ",/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2014,climbingivy,," Idiotic replacement for the likes of Leno and Johnny Carson
","N.B.C. aka the National Broadcasting Network has lost their liberal minds.Steve Allen,Jack Paar,Johnny Carson and Jay Leno knew that the Tonight Show was not about the host, but about the guests appearing, and the give and take between the host and the guests.Now with Jimmy Fallen as the host, the show is garbage.What is to like?Jimmy Fallen with Justin Timberhead, rapping and dancing around like a couple of fools.I believe that you N.B.C., dumped Jay Leno because he dared to make fun of Republicans and Democrats.We can't have a N.B.C. host making fun of Democrats can we? Fine N.B.C.! What you have done is to destroy another American institution with a liberal punk who has no talent.Keep it up N.B.C., you have ruined the Olympics coverage with liberal puke hosts.Now you have destroyed what Steve Allen,Jack Paar,Johnny Carson and Jay Leno worked so hard to build up.",/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2015,jidavis-225-549846,5," Weak and getting weaker
","Agree with reviewers who say that Fallon can pull off some funny bits but doesn't have the stuff to produce a consistently funny and entertaining full show night after night. Understand that a younger guy is supposed to appeal to a younger audience but the incessant giggling/shouting/screaming/hiding under the desk makes it unlikely that he will ever graduate from the third grade. He doesn't engage very well with guests on the show; the silly games are not a substitute for either serious or comic interaction with those appearing on the show. He might consider letting some of his accomplished guests, Seinfeld for example, do a comedy bit on their own. Also agree that the band doesn't add much to the show; would be better just to have higher quality musical guests and have them do two performances as on SNL. Bottom line - Comedy has a lot of staying power but silly gets old in a hurry; Fallon doesn't seem to know the difference between comedy and silly. At the end of the day (haha - get it?!), Jimmy seems to have succumbed to the same problem that plagues SNL; maybe he spent too much time there - take a one-time clever and humorous idea and then repeat it over and over until viewers are sick of it.",/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2016,Ed-Shullivan,10," Well balanced entertainment with Jimmy getting the most out of his guests
","Every night there is one thing you can expect from The Tonight Show hosted by Jimmy Fallon and that is ...every night you don't know what to expect Jimmy will do with his guests. I love the Roots band and emcee Steve Higgins and how they interact with Jimmy, his guests, and how the Roots band music brings this late night talk show to more than just a conversation but brightens an otherwise endless conversation to great blends of music, with dance, and with comical skits that interact with Jimmy and his guests that have us the viewing audience crying of laughter.",/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2015,Irishchatter,10," Hilarious!!!!!!!!!
",Seriously Jimmy has taken this show to another level and of course by storm. He gives us something different in which no other chat shows can do. Even though I know Jimmy Kimmel does the same but not as much as Fallon would do with his show.,/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2014,photoe,4," Opened OK, uncomfortable with U2
","The monologue was OK. It was a bit mushy and maudlin, but had some funny moments and self-deprecating lines that took the pressure off. The studio is smallish and low-ball for the Tonight show. It feels like a college auditorium more than a top-flight spectacle like with Carson and Letterman. It's not a late night stage, and not up to the standards of either Kimmel or Letterman. NBC supports its talent once again. You really wonder about these TV execs sometimes - their lack of ability to put together a show in the classic sense, but that's Hwood nonsense at its peak isn't it?",/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2014,randyw01,," Talk shows hosts have their own way, and that's that
","Fallon doesn't have the raw guttural humor of someone like Ferguson, nor should he expected to be. Fallon's semi-worship of guests has actually toned down a bit....it may drop as he ages, or not.....sometimes people just don't change.",/review/rw2974044/?ref_=tt_urv
