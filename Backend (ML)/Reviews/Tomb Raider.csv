","After a hiatus of over a decade Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau came gloriously back in parts to suit their senior citizen status in Grumpy Old Men. They may move a little slower, but their comic timing hasn't slowed up one bit.",/review/rw1447488/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2006,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," A very fun and sweet film
","I don't know why, but I recently had Grumpy Old Men stuck in my head, I saw it when I was 8 years old with my grandparents, but I figured that I should watch it again before I would comment on it, since your opinion changes when you grow up. So, I rented both Grumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men and I was excited to see a decent rating on IMDb, and I love Walter Matthau, so this was a film to look forward too. Well, I finished it this morning and I have to say that it had it's good laughs along with a very heart warming story for the holidays.",/review/rw1447488/?ref_=tt_urv

14 December 2011,compi24,7," Review Of ""Grumpy Old Men""
","""Grumpy Old Men"" is a 1993 Donald Petrie film about two feuding old men (Lemmon, Matthau) who step up their game to woo their new neighbor (Ann-Margret). Let me start off by saying that I love both Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon and I have heard of how the two of them are often paired together on film. This is the first film I've seen with the both of them in it and I can tell why they were paired together here. The chemistry between Matthau and Lemmon is really noticeable throughout this film - they really love working with each other. Everyone else's performances were also very well done. The movie was also pretty funny overall, but what surprised me the most was that this film featured some very touching and heartwarming scenes within it. Honestly, I can say that this movie surprised me all together. I thought I was only going to get a 90 minute film of two old men swearing at each other. What I got was that, but with very great acting, subplot development, tonal diversity, and more. ""Grumpy Old Men"" is a film that I watched with a genuine smile on my face.",/review/rw1447488/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2005,annmason1,10," A family reunion
","It is sad to watch this wonderful film and realize that most of the actors in it are dead. Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Burgess Meredith, Ozzie Davis...all fine men whose loss to movie goers is felt- at least by this one. Ann-Margret, Darryl Hannah, Kevin Pollak, while still among us, are also perfect for their parts.",/review/rw1447488/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2000,Petey-10,," Great fun for seniors and juniors
","John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon) and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) are neighbors living in snowy Minnesota who have been fighting with each other for several years.Then a lovely widow called Ariel Truax (Ann-Margret) moves to the street.That means competition between John and Max.Grumpy Old Men from 1993 is great fun for seniors and juniors.I'm only 18 but I'm getting older all the time.Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau were great together.Unfortunately Walter died to a heart attack last July at the age of 79.There are also some other great actors in the movie, including Ossie Davis, Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak.Burgess Meredith (1909-1997) is brilliant playing Lemmon's father in the movie.Grumpy Old Men is a heart warming comedy with lots of terrific scenes with Lemmon and Matthau.Don't miss the bloopers during credits.And don't miss this movie.",/review/rw1447488/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2000,Quinoa1984,," A feel good comedy
","This is a good movie because it is a feel good movie.  We see the characters and we don't feel that bad about ourselves.  Another Lemmon and Matthau film, where this time they are two old guys in Minnesota.  Content, until a woman (Ann-Margaret) is the apple of they're eyes.  Great fun, especially from Burgess Meredith, who is hilarious as Lemmon's dirty talking father who is even funnier in the out-takes.  A",/review/rw1447488/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2021,planktonrules,7," To me, it was more a sweet slice of life movie instead of a comedy.

14 July 2002,xflrocks,10," The Actors are Mortal, The Comedy Eternal
","The opening credits in this film roll to the tune of ""Heat Wave"", and it was during a recent heat wave that I dusted off my well-worn copy of ""Grumpy Old Men"" and settled in to once again watch the first of four movies that made up the ""second coming"" of the Jack Lemmon/Walter Matthau team.  To those who have not yet seen the movie, (yes, there may be a few) it was set (and filmed) in snowy Minnesota, which give the film an authentic small town feel that the talented set designers of Hollywood would be hard pressed to duplicate.  From the stars' first lines in the film (""'Morning ****head"", ""Hello moron"") we know what to expect, and the movie doesn't disappoint us. The verbal sparring between Max and John continues non-stop through 100+ laugh filled minutes.  Both the plot and the ending are not quite believable, but who really cares? For those who want reality, there are many depressing films out there, not to mention the news- papers and CNN. I have never read if all the cast members were the first choices for the parts, but every one of the cast fits their roles perfectly.  Ann-Margret has evolved from her dancing, grinding ""sexpot"" image in the 60's to a wonderful, natural actress. Burgess Meredith....what can I say?  He's perfect as John's father, a crusty, lovable old man.  The interplay between Jack and Burgess is so easy, and why not?  Who better to play a 94 year old than the 80+ year old Meredith. While Burgess is lovable, Daryl Hannah is lovely. As John's daughter Melanie, I have never seen her look more beautiful and heart-melting as she does in this picture.  Ozzie Davis, Kevin Pollak, and Buck Henry round out the cast, and bring their many talents to the picture. While much has been written about the comedy, very little is said about the realistic side of  ""Grumpy Old Men"".  There are a few fleeting scenes that reveal the heartache and loneliness of growing old.  And John's dealings with the I.R.S. in the movie, while hilarious, points out what can happen when the machine-like IRS process starts to roll over an individual not caring about the human-real life side of the situation. The only ""downer"" for me in again watching this movie is the knowlege that the string is over.  Walter and Jack and Burgess are gone.  I can't watch this movie without feeling just a tinge of sorrow.  When most actors their age pass on, we feel sorrow, and then watch their classics from decades ago.  With Walter and Jack the best was yet to come. I have read elsewhere that scripts were in the works for ""Grumpy Old Men 3""  and ""Odd Couple 3"".  Who knows how many more successful films this brilliant team could have made together.  I doubt if the formula for their success would have grown stale, because both Walter and Jack no longer acted....their roles where just an extension of themselves.",/review/rw1447488/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2005,au_law2001,9," Classic Matthau and Lemmon
","This is an instant classic and a very recognizable film of the two, that if you ask someone about them, they will always mention this. A grreat and memorable role of the two, and and very hilarious, you'll want to see it again. They are a bunch of bumbling and feuding neighbors, who are in love with the same woman. Every scene with them in this one is unforgettable and outrageously funny. Especially the scenes with Matthau, with the fishing pole that sinks into the ice, he screams loud. An unforgettable scream and very funny too. He does the same when Ann Margaret drops the big fish before he can get a shot of it, and again when he discovers the dried fish that Jack Lemmon put in his car without him noticing it, and I like his line there, ""ya shmuck!"" That was funny. Boy those two are really funny, but at the same time they know how to make dramatic scenes that are almost teary, and sometimes serious and heart-warming ones, but they still become funny at the end and seem to keep it like that. Recommended to all fans of the two.",/review/rw1447488/?ref_=tt_urv

24 July 2005,theowinthrop,8," Our First Visit to Warbisha, Minnesota
","There is a strange graft regarding the Matthau - Lemmon or Lemmon - Matthau ""buddy"" comedies. They start out on high notes with THE FORTUNE COOKIE and THE ODD COUPLE and then make a couple of comedies again with Billy Wilder together (one is Wilder's version of THE FRONT PAGE) which are not well received. They also do a film KOTCH, where Matthau stars in a straight role as a lively octogenarian, and Lemmon directs him (for his only time as a film director). But while they remained close friends Lemmon and Matthau did not seem to consider making any further films together without Billy Wilder. ",/review/rw1447488/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2006,moonspinner55,6," Friendly enough sitcom with shock-laughs
","In a chilly Minnesota ice-fishing town, two lifelong enemies (who live next door to each other) compete for Ariel, the free-spirited new redhead on the block (Ann-Margret, doing her best with an underwritten role). Comic vehicle for Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon isn't strenuous, it breezes right along, but this type of farce, an insult-slinging sitcom, has been patented and packaged along a cinema assembly-line reaching back many years. The plot is constructed (and constricted) by its one-liners, like a foul-mouthed Neil Simon; the grouchy leads play up the old coot business for all it's worth, but they are so cantankerous that it isn't too likely life-loving Ariel would want either of these guys (her rapport with shopkeeper Ossie Davis, though seen at a distance, appears to be much warmer). Still, there are some laughs on occasion, the locations are well-captured, and the smartly-picked supporting cast is winning. **1/2 from ****",/review/rw1447488/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is a laugh riot. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau play two neighbors that have known each other their whole lives. They have been arguing about anything and everything for the last thirty years. The still vivacious, Ann-Margret moves into the neighborhood and now the fun really begins. Both old grumps try out doing the other in order to get the possible affection of the new comer. Burgess Meredith plays Grandpa and just about single handedly steals the show. Playing cardboard parts are Ossie Davis, Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah. Buck Henry is as always...funny.  You will laugh till your sides hurt.

","Sort of reprising their roles from ""The Odd Couple"", Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau play a pair of elderly rivals in a small Minnesota town whose mutual hostility gets agitated by the arrival of a younger woman (Ann-Margaret). OK, so this story seems to get used a lot, but ""Grumpy Old Men"" shows - if nothing else - that Lemmon and Matthau still had it, and that Ann-Margaret's pretty hot. Much of the humor comes in Lemmon's and Matthau's pranks against each other.",/review/rw1447488/?ref_=tt_urv
