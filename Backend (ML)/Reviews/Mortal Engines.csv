23 July 2010,fred-kolb,," My favorite book of all time was turned into an ambitious, dramatic and emotional miniseries, that could hot have been better!
","I always wondered why nobody ever thought about turning Ken Follett's brilliant epic ""The Pillars of the Earth"" into a movie. Without a doubt, it is the greatest book I have ever read, with a cleverly constructed and well-researched story, engaging characters and is full of intrigues, violence and sex. There is so much going on in the book that not a single page seems to be wasted, which is saying a lot about a novel that has over 1000 of them. Now, over two decades after the novel hit the bookshelves, Ridley and Tony Scott bring you an eight-part miniseries that promises to be one of the best ones I have seen in recent years.",/review/rw2335065/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2010,dave-sturm,9," Epic novel brought grandly to the screen
","I have read everything Ken Follett has written, but I pretty much had him pegged as a writer of extraordinarily readable suspense potboilers. Better than Stephen King, but no Cormac McCarthy. Then, in 1989 he unveiled ""Pillars of the Earth"" and I was stunned. Follett gave full rein to his incredibly vivid and compelling storytelling abilities. When I finished I was sad. I could no longer follow the adventures of these heroic and scheming English men and women in the the tumultuous 12th Century, a time of uncertainty over who should be on the throne.",/review/rw2335065/?ref_=tt_urv

6 August 2010,gradyharp,," An Ambitious Epic for Television: Year 1
","PILLARS OF THE EARTH is an ambitious cinematic adaptation of Ken Follett's novel by the same name. This first season is to be eight episodes, with a 'Season 2' already suggested. The overall message of this historical novel can be summarized as follows: this is a story 'about the building of a cathedral in the fictional town of Kingsbridge, England. It is set in the middle of the twelfth century, primarily during the time sometimes called the Anarchy, between the time of the sinking of the White Ship and the murder of Thomas Becket. The story traces the development of Gothic architecture out of the preceding Romanesque architecture and the fortunes of the Kingsbridge priory against the backdrop of actual historical events of the time. Although Kingsbridge is the name of an actual English town, the Kingsbridge in the novel is actually a fictional location representative of a typical market town of the time'.

13 March 2012,Leofwine_draca,10," Gripping brilliance
","Ken Follett's lengthy historical novel THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH is far too intricate to adapt into a feature-length production, so producers instead opted for this miniseries treatment which gives a full 8 hours to the plotting. And, quite simply, it's wonderful. THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH has it all and is up there with the best miniseries of all time – I'm thinking BAND OF BROTHERS et al. From the very first episode I was engrossed in the wonderful storyline which brings history to life via living, breathing characters caught up in intrigue, danger and romance.",/review/rw2335065/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2011,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8," A rough-handed angel
","Set in England during medieval times, this is a fictional account of what happens after a dying king's proper heir dies in a shipwreck. There are many characters(including a family that seek to construct a grand cathedral, two siblings who lose their nobility and try to regain it, and several men of God with more or less pure intentions and granted, not everyone is actually necessary) and a lot of plot, and it can be dizzying at first, but it is worth your attention(if you like what you see early on it ain't gonna change). While I have not read the novel and can make no comparisons, I watched this with two people who love it and they both said that it wasn't the exact same and that they still enjoyed it a lot. This is gripping right off the bat, and it keeps to an intense pace throughout. There are many developments, and while it can at times come off as just going back and forth between the same couple of options, you tend to follow them with interest surpassing that of the best banks. The tension and suspense are great. This has good and well-delivered dialog, with many memorable lines(and razor-sharp points about what it was like back then). The exploration of the awful situations that people could be and were stuck in back then, on account of the system, religion and their lack of rights is excellent and chilling. This is realistic(a lot of the way), authentic and has an incredible richness of detail. The strong feminist behavior of the women in this would not have been tolerated as we see here. This has mostly credible psychology, including for the villains(if one or two are black and white in depiction). The acting, writing and direction are marvelous, and the music is as well. This has amazing production values. No one is sacred, anyone could die at any time in this. The twists and unexpected turns of events keep you guessing how it will end, and it is fairly satisfying. There are power struggles, deception, politics and manipulation aplenty. This does seem to think itself Shakespeare at times, using effects right out of Macbeth and Hamlet. There is dramatic license leading to things that couldn't happen happening. This has some humor. There is some action, and it works well. You can tell this was executive produced by the Scott brothers. The atmosphere is fitting, this always builds the right mood. This can be called a soap opera to some extent, though I would classify it as one of the better ones. Redmayne is a Christian Bale wannabe once he starts talking(he does thankfully refrain from the pitiful Eastwood impersonation). There is a lot of disturbing content, a bit of blood and violence, sexuality, nudity and a little strong language(largely it isn't gratuitous). I recommend this to any fan of epics. 8/10",/review/rw2335065/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2010,Caps Fan,6," Worth Watching
","Ken Follett's graphic, brutal, but compelling portrayal of life in 12th-century England during the chaotic reign of King Stephen has long been a favorite of mine. I even had a sneaking liking for the villains! So I was looking forward to this ambitious television version. It is a true international effort - produced jointly by Germany and Canada, shot mostly in Hungary with a mostly British cast – and weighs in at 480 minutes of TV time.",/review/rw2335065/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'll admit that I almost gave up on this series after the first episode. So many plots shown briefly and so many characters! But I had just taken a course on the period so I battled through it. Luckily, they've been doing many repeated showings of the episodes, so I watched the first episode a second time and the series has won me over.",/review/rw2335065/?ref_=tt_urv

","No one seems to understand their character so they all just kind of mail in ""Medieval townsperson"" cardboard cutouts. Sarah Parish, in particular, is in the wrong production. She's doing an impression of a drag queen doing an impression of Lady Macbeth. If she was any more camp, she'd be carrying around a bag of marshmallows.",/review/rw2335065/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2013,jjnxn-1,1," What a sorry mess
","Almost total bastardization of a great novel. Whoever adapted the source material obviously didn't understand it and its strengths. They weakened both of the major characters, Philip and Aliena, and for whatever reason brought the royals who were just shadowy supporting characters in the novel too much into the fore. This IS NOT a worthwhile version of the book but some tired retread of the battle for the throne of England during the same time period with the novel's title stuck on. Aliena is miscast with an actress without the necessary fire to make her live on screen and although Matthew MacFayden is a fine actor there is little he can do to make Prior Philip the strong central character he should be since he has been adapted into a gullible milksop. The less said about the distortion of the character of William, a truly reprehensible devil in the book, into a dominated rather churlish mama's boy here the better. There are some good performances, notably Rufus Sewell as Tom Builder, but it is just not worth the effort to sit through this sorry enterprise.",/review/rw2335065/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2010,dtuttle,," Better than anyone could have hoped for.
","One of my favorite books of all time turned into a TV series that shows up out of no where. I was expecting something truly disappointing. After watching the first two episodes I can honestly say this is beyond my highest expectations. The plot development is different from the book, but the emotional impact of the story is fully present. The character development draws you in just like the book did. Your desire to know what happens next will surpass that of reading the book. It is such a wonderful thing to see an adaptation that captures it's source so fully and even surpasses it at times. I can't wait for the remaining episodes. This show will win many awards. Addendum after Episode #3: Things dipped a bit in this episode. If I was rating this show using the 10 stars that IMDb uses, I would have gone from 9 previously to 7 now. There were some overly cheesy moments in this episode that seemed to dilute the storytelling skill from the first two episodes. Hopefully this is a rare occurrence.",/review/rw2335065/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2010,amexspam,4," So-So
","The good news is it's over. A formula miniseries that manages to be confusing, boring and historically inaccurate. Spoilers Follow. I don't have a problem with the time compression - that there was 15 years between the drowning of the prince and the death of the original king. I do have a problem that half the series was spent building King Stephen into a type of ogre only to have him essentially removed from the script in the final two episodes. I know King Stephen was a lousy king and that he adopted Henry II to make a successful and peaceful transition after his death, but why was none of this mentioned? And although Rufus Sewell is supposedly the creative star of the series the final church construction ignores anything he contributed. But the fatal dramatic flaw is everything is resolved in the last 40 minutes of this massive and turgid melodrama. The bad guys all die, the good guys almost all win, and events that were unexplained remained unexplained. This was a mediocre series and the reason for the high rating was over TV this summer was even more boring.",/review/rw2335065/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2019,dailerenee,3," Disappointing Adaptation
","If you haven't read the book, then you'll likely view it differently, but if you have read and enjoyed the book, be a bit wary. This adaptation boasts a spectacular cast but it utterly mangles Ken Follet's story. Most of the raw plot elements are there but the depth is replaced by a lot of superfluous drama and sex. The story obviously needed to be simplified to be scaled down to a mini-series, but why add a weird oedipal element to an already complicated story? Many of the changes are so strange that they seem to simply get things wrong in addition to making necessary omissions.",/review/rw2335065/?ref_=tt_urv

","Very good, it is always difficult to find 'drama' that is quality and not overdone, over-the-top or tired. The acting in this is excellent all around and it is definitely worth watching; at least from the two episodes that I have seen thus far.

13 January 2015,edmund-marlowe,5," Pillars built on false foundations
","To explain why this television series is a disappointment, it suffices to compare with historical reality the outline of events depicted in just the first few minutes. We begin with a brief depiction of the White Ship, with English King Henry I's only son and heir and his wife on board, going down in fictitious flames ""off the coast of England"". Actually, it struck a rock just off the coast of Normandy and the prince's wife was far away. The King is dismissive of the promise of his little daughter Maud (actually then a married adult living faraway in Germany) to provide him with heirs, while his unhistorically wicked nephew Stephen (whose real decency is well-known as his undoing) plots his own succession. We then flash forward to 1138 when Henry I (actually already dead for three years) celebrates the birth in Winchester of Maud's son Henry (actually born five years earlier in France) as his prospective heir. The old king then promptly drops dead of a poisoning that has no basis of suspicion in reality and his grieving daughter (actually then in France and at war with her father) narrowly escapes abroad.",/review/rw2335065/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2010,sonicingandentering,," An epic masterpiece that should be a classic.
","Now I did not have the good fortune of reading Ken Follet's book, but when I saw the promos and previews for this, I know I wanted to watch it. The characters are so well done, every one of them has a story element to bring to play and not one of them is poorly written. Everything that happened, and the way it happened, made it believe that it really happened. There was not a single dull moment in the entire miniseries. I never knew that building a church could be the basis for such a gripping storyline riddled with events that never stopped entertaining me. It has a little bit for everyone. For those who enjoy romance, there are several love triangles and paradoxes, for those who enjoy action, there are plenty of bloody sword-wielding fight scenes, there are laughs, there are cries, its not just a miniseries, but an experience; a life. Its absolutely wonderful and I will hope to see it amongst television classics someday.",/review/rw2335065/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2010,darkshadow538,6," Good for thrill seekers, bad for book lovers
","Being a reader of the book this show was a great excitement for me. I was extremely surprised to see it being made but it was a happy surprise for they where making it the right way, in a mini series not a movie, a movie would have been horrendous and ruined the whole thing. That being said I went ahead and viewed the entire series from start to finish. To begin, the actors that played all the parts were absolutely fantastic, they were exactly what i was led to believe when i read the book to perfection. The story was not to far stretched from the truth and I was not entirely disappointed. However with this being a miniseries i was to believe that they would have kept the story as the author had wrote it, a master piece, while this show is good it is by no means a masterpiece. The story that they tell in this show does not stray to far out of line until the last 3-4 episodes. Then it becomes a great a reckless attempt at making a show more on a budget then on what the author created. There was no Richard going to the crusades for the king in the book he went because he killed Alfred for raping Aliena. There was not incest subplot between William and his mother. Williams wife did have a child but because she was so young when she did was unable to bear another. William became sheriff much sooner. William killed a bishop and thats why he was hanged not for some accident. The list goes on and on. If the creators of this miniseries had simply followed the book and extended the series a little bit then maybe they could have made a better show. All this being said, as i stated before, I was not entirely dissatisfied with the show. It was good in its own way. It was simply a disappointment to not see so many stories told by Follet that were either misrepresented or not represented at all. All in all its a good statement of what the book was sort of about but because of the so many eliminated plot lines and characters I ended the series thinking.. That kinda sucked. If your into swords medieval times and ways of thinking this series is for you. If your a strong supporter of the book not so much. As always this is simply my opinion and i am perhaps too in favor of keeping written things in there true form. Please make your own opinions, perhaps watching the series will prompt you to read the book, if so then the series has accomplished something better then itself..",/review/rw2335065/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2010,Finklein,," Beautifully done!
","""Pillars"" is amazing! Yes, it does differ some from the original book but it's another story-telling device that enhances an enthralling tale from the 12th century that is fascinating and exquisitely portrayed. I read the book as well as its sequel and thoroughly enjoyed both. The characters in the mini-series were intriguing, beautifully casted and totally believable. There is no way every detail from the book could be worked into the 8+ hour movie for TV. Critics can take exception to some of the what-was-left-out rather than realizing reading a book and watching a movie involve entirely different enjoyment method levels. The mini-series is worth every effort to view. I sometimes watched episodes 2 or 3 times again to take it all in. The sets, special effects, displays of church control vs. every day life for many was portrayed amazingly well. Say what you will about fractured details, overall ""Pillars of the Earth"" is a fabulous experience that captivates and informs, most of all, invites interest in the metaphor of the building of some of Europe's most gorgeous reaches for heaven architecture-wise as well as the corruption and deceit of many who defied religious belief in the worst ways when they should have been stellar examples of loving leadership.",/review/rw2335065/?ref_=tt_urv

","I usually don't review series, but this is more a 7 part movie than a string of episodes. Based on a book that I have not read, it is about the world of politics and betrayal in the 1100's.

","Can live with bad effects, the setting is OK. But historically so unbelievable bad. And the historical errors mostly not from the book. This isn't a movie in a medieval setting. This is a bad dream of the middle ages. The importance of Follet's first Pillars-Book to bring light in the ""dark ages"". They weren't dark. But the series brings all to dark black night. A monk who should been hanged? In the middle ages? Prior Philipp really ask Jack if he would be praying! Never a people in the European middle ages would ask such a question. Never somebody would think, you would not pray! Thiefes who get burned? Nonsense, they were hanged. In the middle ages ""witches"" were not often burned. This happened mostly in the later times until the french revolution. But yeah! A bit incest, so we have something to look at! Please - don't bring the really bad second book to ""life"".

","This series is currently showing on UK television. Unlike many series it wasn't given a big build-up. Someone in the scheduling team obviously has a conscience. The series is, to use a good old British phrase, total tosh. Strangely entertaining in a so bad it is almost good sort of way. Rufus Sewell does what he can to redeem the early episodes. Ian McShane plays the ""baddie"" with relish but no great depth. Donald Sutherland plays Donald Sutherland and sticks out like a sore thumb. The female leads are all unconvincing as medieval women - behaving with 21st century manners and mores. Strange that the Scotts were involved with this since I liked Kingdom of Heaven and Robin Hood. I will continue to watch to find out what happens (I haven't read the book) but it even makes Cadfael (based in the same period) look good.",/review/rw2335065/?ref_=tt_urv

31 May 2011,klein_joanne,5," Good cast wasted on poor history
","I have not read the book and mainly watched this as a fan of many of the actors and as a historian. I am perfectly willing to allow that an author can take liberties with history in order to make an engaging story that works in a mini-series. However, that is no excuse for getting basic facts just wrong. Many of the royals were grossly mischaracterized, either as idiots, monsters, or both. Prince Eustace, for example, was not some craven boy but notorious for quite the opposite, and Prince Henry did not kill Eustace in battle. Stephen was not involved in any plots to murder Prince William or Henry I. Maud was empress because she married the Holy Roman Emperor, not because she took the title on a whim. Mistakes in basic monastic and village life were endless. It all got quite ridiculous. I hope no one watching this series believes that any of this supposed history was accurate. I enjoyed the story as a story, though I thought the bad guys were rather cartoonish in their evil. The cast was terrific, and made what was rather a soap opera into something much better. Kudos go especially to Tony Curran as Stephen, Natalia Wörner as Ellen, and Rufus Sewell as Tom Builder. So, if you like a good drama, this is fun and over the top. If you like history, this isn't it.",/review/rw2335065/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2010,lastcall-1,7," Godd, but could have been great
","Ken Follett's novel is an all time classic,and it was great to see it put on screen. The result is good. I watched the whole miniseries in one day; once you started you cannot stop, like when you read Follett's book. The cast is perfect. Ian Mc Shane is brilliant as always, and all those wonderful English actors and actresses are perfect. One thing bothered me a lot though; the monuments, the clothes, the furniture look more renaissance than 12th century, and it's a shame because it spoils the credibility of the movie. It did not surprise me though, knowing that it was produced by Ridley Scott. After his awful Robin Hood, you knew what to expect. I wish it would have been as accurate as Jean Jacques Annaud's ""In the name of the Rose"". It would have been a masterpiece instead of the pleasant mini series we have here. Ar least, it is very entertaining .",/review/rw2335065/?ref_=tt_urv
