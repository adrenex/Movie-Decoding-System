3 May 2021,MartynGryphon,9," Like the Sexify app, this series hits the right spot.
",What does one do on a boring Bank Holiday weekend in the UK? The answer is to plumb the depths of Netflix looking for a series to binge watch.,/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2021,iconians,9," Fun but with serious understones
","This is obviously, this series is not meant to be too serious, but since this is a Polish series, I was not able to just enjoy it but also found it to have serious societal undertones. Poland can still be a fairly conservative society, and this series offers a good look at the generational shifts with the discussion of certain taboo's.",/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2021,qui_j,9," Smart, clever, and modern comedy series!
","This is a change from the dismal offerings that have come out of Poland in recent years. Usually, those series seem not to use a story board so the plot is often confusing and the production done at a low level. Sexify changes all that. The production is slick, and the writing smart and clever. It is a well cast series with very believable acting. Don't know if there'll be a second season as the story arc seemed complete! Well worth the watch!",/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2021,anotherfigaro,9," Surprisingly good for the recent series trends on Netflix.
","When I saw this being advertised on Netflix and being polish and female... I was like "" oh probably another embarrassing series"" but it turned out to be exactly the opposite.",/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2021,kanavchopra-43376,8," Something light and entertaining
","If you are watching some long and serious series and you want to lighten up your mood, then this series is for you. It will keep you entertained and no boring scenes at all!",/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2021,elisateis,10," Great series !
","First, I loved to hear Polish and loved the atmosphere of the film (the music was fun). To me it was an easy to watch series with a feminist touch. As a woman, I am glad that this kind of subject comes up. I was a bit tired of the classic high school (childish) American series to be honest.... Or the old mums that try to finally live their life after realizing that their lives suck. I believe that women are much more than theses stereotypes ;)",/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2021,agnieszkaka-09208,9," Very entertaining and easy to watch
",I really enjoyed watching it. I also enjoyed the music and the flow of this series. It gets better from 3rd episode.,/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2021,lorensmits,10," Exactly what we need in this day and age
","It's nice to watch a series that actually makes me feel better about myself from time to time. Especially when the series shows humor, realistic main characters and is from Poland, a country I knew nothing about!",/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,davidpetty-38596,8," Very well done!
","Sexify is a well-written and executed romp through a younger Polish generation's thoughts on dating, relations, and sex. Given the historically conservative nature of Poland, it was quite a satisfying surprise to see all the pushback from a younger generation. Set initially on a college campus, it follows the lives of the three female protagonists who develop the Sexify app. I found the dialog quite enjoyable, particularly the interchanges between the girls and their occasional mates. I also much enjoyed hearing Polish spoken; I followed with English subtitles. The music fit the scenes. In all, a strong 8, at least! Kudos!",/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2021,dharmitdholakia,9," The f....king great show man!!
","The background music, story building, emotional connections with actors and great acting by all actors, especially an actor mokinaüëèüëè her facial expressions is top of the world.",/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2021,AnnaPagrati,10," So great!
","I enjoyed this show so much! I honestly did not have the highest expectations for it, but it surprised me for good. I'd LOVE to watch a season 2!",/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2021,alice_ok_,10," The only disappointment: the app doesn't exist irl
","Loved the series, loved to watch a polish series :) I'm Swedish and spoiled with being able to watch series where everyone speaks English without subtitles. But I love to watch series and films from other countries too, recently did on the Gothenburg Film Festival which was digital last year.",/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2021,marcinowski_w,8," The soundtrack is awesome and the story is too!
","I rarely review TV shows but after reading a few comments about how bad the soundtrack is, I started wondering what's wrong with people. I found it to be one of the best soundtracks ever and it's repetitive on purpose, that's the whole point and people don't get it. Geez. Overall, great topic, so happy to see they
female orgasm as the main subject of a Netflix TV show, yesssss, feels like 21st century. Well done :)",/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2021,beeandwax,9," Binge-worthy
","Watched first two episodes and I think I'll continue watching. The way Natalia, Pauline and Monika are changing their lives around just for a graduation project, It's amazing!",/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2021,vargamolnarb,10," It's not a Sex Education copy...
","In fact this series is more moving and the vibe is more gripping. Yes, the music is amazing.",/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2021,Chris_Ego,10," a secret highlight in the jungle of new series
",I live in Austria which is not far from Poland and I admit you will understand the characters and the setting better if you are from around. Nevertheless this Polish gem from directors Kalina Alabrudzinska and Piotr Domalewski are worth binge watching. With 8 episodes going approx. 1 hour each you get a fine developed script starring interesting characters of a Warzaw university in their process of programming an app while struggling with their environment.,/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2021,penkejk,3," It touches an important topic but...
",... that's about it. It doesn't make you think about anything. It doesn't present the topic in any interesting way.,/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2021,ronandrews-10872,10," A really, really good show
","There were times the show's development became a little slow but it came together extremely well at the end. It reminded me of research I did when I was in college and the ups and downs that go with it. But this had a little bit of everything: a decent comedy, some romance, and some drama.",/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2021,avinashrodda,10," It's Mind Blowing .. series
",I never seen Polish web series but.. it's fantastic . Looking forward for 2 season.,/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2021,sourabhhemnani,10," Brilliant
",In starting this really seems to be copy of sex education but this is the conflicting one.,/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2021,rakibulhat,10," I'm in love with this series
",Brilliant üëå Now I'm a Fan of this dorm and the Friend circle of these girls. üíô Story is outstanding üëå,/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2021,jacekpoplawski,9," nice and cool comedy show
",I am not a fan of comedy movies from Poland but this series is suprisingly good.,/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2021,bluemanmtl,10," Sexify is sexy, yes, but also fun and quirky, watch it
","I really enjoyed Sexify from Netflix this quirky, fun, sexy, heart touching polish dramedy, is a wonderful, well acted and awesome show to watch! Looking forward to season 2!!",/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2021,fionadelondras,10," Enjoyable!
","It is certainly a hidden gem waiting to be discovered, just like the app if it was real! The storyline is great, the characters are well structured and developed, 3 female leads, each having their own story and journey to discover.",/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2021,jnrthor,4," Silly Show
","I was interested early but it took a lot of time to get to the punchline. It's an innocuous silly show and while the actresses gave it their all, the material wasn't there. I can say that the three lead actresses are cute and they grew on me over time. And now it sets up for a second season that will likely just revisit season 1 except that these ladies will likely be working to commercialize the app. Unless they can expand that topic there's not much to work with. But it is entertainment. The plot is not nearly compelling as Sex Education.",/review/rw6939770/?ref_=tt_urv
