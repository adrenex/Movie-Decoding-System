",Uncle is a well written comedy and Nick Helm is an underrated talent.. ,/review/rw2943837/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2014,Kookyburra,8," So far so good
","Three episodes in and so far this is a well written and likable sitcom. Don't be put off by the trailer which didn't really do it justice or the fact that it's screening on the home to some of the worst crimes against TV comedy in recent years, BBC3. ",/review/rw2943837/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2014,SceneByScene,," Superb characterisation. Humour; but also great pathos & the realism of humanity. Plus great interludes of original music as mock pop/rock band videos !
",This is a super new comedy.,/review/rw2943837/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2014,ianlouisiana,," like tuning in for the first time a soap that's been running for years
","Relatively few TV comedies even in the 21st century start with the central character about to commit suicide in the bath by cutting a string holding a portable radio above the water.Just as the eponymous Uncle tells himself he will allow his ex a few seconds to phone him and save his life the phone does actually ring,but it is his sister wanting him to pick up her son,his nephew,from school.Just the encouragement he needs to postpone the felo - de - se to a more convenient time. The boy,as weird in fact as his uncle,is pressed to accompany him on a strange odyssey to the gym where his ex's father runs a school for male pole dancers.The father is an ageing transvestite,looking like a cross between Freddy Mercury and Alice Cooper,but less feminine. A completely random musical number is inserted here and my cup runneth over. At last the BBC have realised the true meaning of ""off the wall"". ""Uncle"" makes absolutely no sense whatsoever - it's like suddenly tuning into a soap that's been running for years and having no idea what's going on.I loved it.",/review/rw2943837/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2015,djprice-24081,10," Fantastic Comedy Laughed from start to finish
","This is a really great comedy drama TV series. I laughed all the way. I particularly loved the music video ""No Survivors"" ",/review/rw2943837/?ref_=tt_urv

26 January 2021,nowego,9," Took Me Two Goes
","This show took me two goes to watch it, eight years apart. The first time I tried to watch it I did not even get through the first episode before I gave up. Eight years later I binge watched the entire 3 seasons in one day.",/review/rw2943837/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2020,maxlascelles,10," Beautiful, touching comedy
","Uncle is a sitcom I truly wish more people had seen. Throughout its (woefully short) 3 seasons, it deals with some very heavy themes, particularly depression and addiction, whilst still being very funny. The writing is sharp, hilarious and sincere. It's laden with pathos and there's clearly an understanding of mental health issues, yet it never strays into the realm of being patronising or sappy. I often find that sitcoms of this nature sacrifice a lot of the humour and begin to focus too much on tragedy and drama, Uncle does not, nor does it linger on the dark subjects unnecessarily. Maybe I'm alone in my love of this series, but it really resonated with me. I've experienced some very dark times (most of us have) but the one thing that kept me going was always laughter. Even at rock bottom, you can usually find something to laugh about, and that to me is what this series excels in conveying. It really struck a chord with me, and I highly recommend that everyone give it a try!",/review/rw2943837/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2021,mckaymalcolm,9," Only just discovered this yesterday
","Such a great find, and I can't believe that I somehow missed this series when it originally aired.
Filled with heart, laughter, pathos and addresses more serious issues such as suicide. drug dependency and bullying without mocking them.
The acting's great, especially from the young nephew Errol.
I've binged 5 episodes so far and looking forward to the next 15.
Bravo!",/review/rw2943837/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2020,samraff-86689,7," I love loved it
","Really great and surprising. While it may not be the most original, the characters really hold it up. It's much more of a character comedy more than a situational comedy.
It has it's own personality, I LOVE the songs, and it got me so invested and connected I was in tears at one particular episode, and while season three isn't as strong as the first two, due to it falling into British tv tropes more than I'd like, it still got me. I was genuinely quite sad and close to tears by the finale, I loved the moment with Val, and the final mortal kombat game between Andy and Errol.
It was so cathartic and heart wrenching simultaneously to see Andy do what he's been struggling with the whole series, show his feelings.
Overall, great show, I can recommend it, and it struck quite a chord with me so yeah, great.",/review/rw2943837/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2017,DavidYZ,7," Funny sitcom
","This is a BBC sitcom that is set in London. Nick Helm plays Andy - a poor, unemployed man in his thirties who lives alone and wants to become a successful rock musician. He finds a purpose in life when he becomes involved in the life of his divorced sister's son, Errol. He is 12 when the show starts and is quiet, geeky and unpopular.",/review/rw2943837/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2019,krweg,9," Well done!!!
","I saw the pilot and turned it off. I thought the characters were anoying and the plot cooked up.
But I gave it a second chance and the following episodes were much better than the pilot. It got Much funnier and characters became more likable.",/review/rw2943837/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2021,lindee-20510,9," Surprisingly very good
","When I started watching,as I was up a friend's and they started watching,and just carried on till the last series,reminded me of hugh grsntd about a boy but more superior Con O'Neill as Val fantastic,Nick Helin,and Elliot Speller-Gillott make a great duo,nice to see Sandra Dickinson on the screen again",/review/rw2943837/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2018,hoakley-97603,8," Enjoyable,easy going comedy
","Uncle is a great comedy from its first series to its superb third one, Series three of uncle is phenomenal and tackles cancer with such a comedic effect which makes you want to cry and also laugh hysterically. If you're thinking about watching this I seriously suggest you do because its a great comedy with an amazing soundtrack with the songs sung by the main actor Nick helm.

24 May 2021,dearssilver,8," Great series
","Can't believe I've only just discovered this gem, brilliant casting and characters, really funny and some of the songs are great.",/review/rw2943837/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2014,baronmanipul,5," Freshly unfresh
","While watching the pilot I couldn't stop thinking about how much it was reminding me of something else - right from the first scene to the last one, simply the whole thing. The story is just so similar to a short movie called Curfew (maybe watch that instead, if you're gonna watch this show), plot and details are almost the same (even the name-giving: Andrew because of his uncle, Sophia because of her uncle's flip-book), but Curfew is in my opinion so much better. In Uncle the only thing that was ""missing"" was the last scene with another suicidal attempt. But anyway... I'm curious how the show is going to evolve in next episodes and what the story will be like.",/review/rw2943837/?ref_=tt_urv
