17 January 2023,PuckerFactor,6," It needs a different approach to the sport.
","The jump cuts are annoying and the cheerleading sycophantic background commentary can be cringeworthy at times. The series needs a toned-down perspective rather than the fanfare it injects into every situation. Instead, we get contrived setups of personal moments (especially with ditzy girlfriends) and a whole episode on Nick Kyrgios throwing tantrums because he's a ""misunderstood"" and ""troubled"" boy...Oh boohoo! Give us a break!",/review/rw8849419/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,lovemichaeljordan,8," Intimate Look Into the Life of an Athlete in One of the Most Mentally Demanding Sports in the World
",You can know nothing about tennis and still enjoy this show. The rules are explained in a way everyone will understand. Simply watching highlights of a tennis match will not give you the same insight as this show does. Viewers will gain a new appreciation of the mental and physical tests tennis players go through.,/review/rw8849419/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,ukxenafan1,9," Enjoyable but not much new for tennis fans
","I'm a big tennis fan, and mostly women's tennis. For anyone who follows the sport, there is nothing that revealing but it is still good to see behind the scenes a bit. I can't stand Nick Kyrgios so the way he was pushed as the mercurial, misunderstood genius was irritating. Let's hope they include him being charged in a domestic abuse case in the next part!",/review/rw8849419/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,etspettroll,7," solid documentary so far
","As a tennis fan I think it's important to show the inside of the sport which I think lacks access to the fans at times. Sport of more than about hitting a ball, it's about the history, the drama, the psychology and getting to know the players. A few of the players gave good access, I wish more would have done.",/review/rw8849419/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,lesiopiwo,4," Too much Instagram
","For most of it, I felt it was more of an Instagram platform for tennis players girlfriends than tennis players themselves. I hope the next part will be more professional, more tennis oriented. However, I like the whole psychology of the game, the stamina of the players and all the insights. Hopefully more of this in future episodes. Also , please include more new faces, more newcomers , young players and concentrate more on their relationships with their coaches and family, how they spend the free time, than short relationships with the models. How about more information on famous tennis venues around the world? This could be an endless series if done right !",/review/rw8849419/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,cindyrellaexists,5," If you like watching tantrums
",I hated the first episode. Can someone tell Nick Kyrgios that the whole tantrum thing has been done and he should get over himself.,/review/rw8849419/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,nyzgg,5," So many stories to tell, but so few are told.
","In the first episode, they talk about 164 male players, and 164 female players vying for a trophy at the Australian Open. I was hopeful to hear about some of the stories, but each episode seems to focus on only one or two people, so I found this lack of storytelling very disappointing.",/review/rw8849419/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,twentyviii,6," Break Point
","I love tennis, so I feel like this definitely could've been done better. I'm not entirely sure I liked the player focused episodes-I enjoy seeing how they prepare and overcome/deal with criticism and frustration, but if it had just been tour focused the ground covered could have been better. I know Drive to Survive has specific talking points and is sometimes driver focused, but it really makes you feel like F1 is this big great thing you want to be a part of-this is lacking on the tennis side. It's sort of like ""A week in the lives of"" instead of the ATP and WTA tour. The best episode was the one where the new kids are trying to figure out how to beat Rafa-and it only kept my interest high because, well, Rafa. Also, why is Maria Sharapova in this? Roddick does commentary, so I see how his points of view would be insightful-he knows a bit more about this next-gen class. Anyway, I'm obviously going to keep watching, but as I said-I love tennis, and even I was bored during some points of the show.",/review/rw8849419/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,lucifer345,10," unbelievable and super exciting series to watch!
","I enjoyed this show so soo sooo much! I stopped playing professional tennis two years ago. It was awful, cuz i have loved it. This series made me want to play again. Its unbelievable! Fascinating! And super-duper exciting! Like ""your heart starts beating faster""...
tho its good if u know the rules of a tennis match, in my opinion someone who never played tennis before can also enjoy it.",/review/rw8849419/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,Aleigh558,3," Good idea but pretty boring
","Obviously made off the back of the success of Drive to Survive but this seriously lacked the drama. Too much focus on the background of the players, none of which were particularly interesting and not enough about the actual tennis.",/review/rw8849419/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,todd-ramirez,7," Why is Kyrgios the first episode?
",Disclaimer: 17 minutes into the first episode here.,/review/rw8849419/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,gergelyjandrasits,8," A good glimpse into the toughness of tennis
","Very enjoyable portraits of the new(er) generation who will have very little time winning anything after the big 3 is gone and before Alcaraz and co. Kick in the door. Shows very well how mentally tough tennis is beyond the obvious physical aspects. I cannot understand people (also in the reviews) who dare to question some players who sometimes don't handle the immense pressure 100% correct...but haters gonna hate. One thing that baffled me in the series though is that they dedicated a mere minute to one of the (if not the) biggest comebacks in tennis history in episode 2. Otherwise good insights, suspenseful scenes, great atmosphere.",/review/rw8849419/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,ari20981,6," Hard to get through
",Being a huge tennis fan I was a bit disappointed with the series. I was put off when I saw that an entire episode was dedicated to Nick Kyrgios! He may be talented but has zero ethics and is a horrible example for future generations.,/review/rw8849419/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,antonyp-42221,8," Solid start to Part

",The documentary speaks about great players and young talents coming up in the world of tennis yet were forced to listen to Maria Sharpiva that cheating doping crook who stole feom women's tennis???

3 February 2023,abhinav-manchanda,4," Good stories, bad on-court camera work
