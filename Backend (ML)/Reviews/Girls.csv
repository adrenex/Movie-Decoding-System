3 September 2017,TheLittleSongbird,7," Gets under the skin
","Despite being a box office failure, 'Under the Skin' was a critical success with a lot of critics citing it as ""an unforgettable experience"" and one of the best films of the year. Audience reaction, as one can see here, has been much more divisive.",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2014,3xHCCH,7," Bizarrely Mesmerizing
","From the beginning shot of this film depicting lights and eclipses, we will already see that this will not be just another run-of-the-mill motion picture. When we see a nude Scarlett Johansson for the first time in that pristine white room, we definitely know we are in for a different sort of ride. ",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2016,Tweekums,8," An intriguing film that probably requires a second viewing
","As this film opens a motorcyclist drives along a remote Scottish road and retrieves the body of a woman from a field and takes in to a white van. We then see her in a pure white space where a naked woman proceeds to undress her then put on her clothes. She then drives the van to Glasgow and starts asking men for directions, as she does so see asks if they are local and have friends or familyÂ… when one doesn't she offers him a lift. She then lures him back to a dilapidated house where, in what can best be described as a black space, they start to undress. He walks towards her but gradually sinks into an oily liquid without noticing. She continues this emotionless behaviour until she finds a disfigured man; for some reason he is spared. She then heads to the highlands where she abandons the van and meets a man on a bus. While they spend the night together the motorcyclist, who has 'dealt with' the man she spared, is driving north towards her location.",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2015,jon1410,," Feeling for the alien
","In the film Under the Skin there is no story line or development of character(as in the book), the almost non-existent story must be created from what we see. Johansson plays a blank,humanoid void of personality, filling in (like us) the blanks of what she knows with what she sees. The stroke of genius was dropping an A-list star into the streets of Glasgow and her mixing with non actors using a Kiarostami-type -10 approach to filming in and from the white van, with all the sounds of the street filtering through. I wonder how much this film traded on Scarlet Johansson's celebrity glamour rather than her acting skills as she seems like a passive observer, almost mute, apart from a few encounters with stranger pick-ups on the streets, where the recognisable husky voice and seductive tone reels another unsuspecting victim into her lair. There are some brilliant,stunning visual effects, making the film realise the the alien presence with the eye image from the spherical globe, to the birth of her human identity in the all-white space, where she dons the victim's clothes and identity. The heroine knows how to drive a car and turn a sentence, and the use of red lip-stick as she kerb crawls.",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2015,Daggerborn,7," The film that truly proves what a visual medium film is
","I implore anybody that has seen this movie once, and not liked it, to watch it once more. This time, however, take into account that film is a visual medium. Instead of expecting a narrator or a character to easily explain to you what is happening try paying attention to what is happening. Examine and truly THINK about what is expressed visually. The brilliant part about Under The Skin is how well it tells a story without dialog, without running commentary, and without the central character saying much at all.",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2014,The_moan_of_all_moans,4," Someone kept pausing the film....no wait they didn't.
","I would like to start by saying i am a fan of films that are ""different"". I don't need a million gunshots or explosions to entertain me. I am not set on good guy vs bad guy and good guy winning. I like thought provoking films; i enjoy them much more than the soul sucking films that are manufactured on a daily basis. So i was intrigued by this one. The trailer was dark and seemed full of suspense. The critics had made bold comparisons with Stanley Kubrick, which in itself is a massive compliment. And as someone who lives in Scotland it had a little sentiment to it. ",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2014,markgorman,9," Jonathon Glazer continues his ascent with another fabulous movie that will entirely divide its audience
",You have never seen a movie even remotely like this.,/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2015,bongo_x,4," The problem here...
","The problem with movies like this is that you have the people who hate slow, mysterious movies and it's automatically 1 star because there were no car chases or dubstep, and the people that feel they have to defend anything quiet and ambiguous like this and give 9 or 10 stars. ""So boring"" vs ""You just don't get it, man"". These types of films always only get 1 or 10 ratings. Really, it's not possible to make a so-so version?",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2014,davidgee,1," Long shots and long silences
","The last time I was this bored in a cinema it was during the era of the French New Wave: films like Last Year In Marienbad and Hiroshima Mon Amour, which were all about Style (if you can call it that) rather than Substance.",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2015,Turfseer,4," Brilliant cinematography can't save empty vessel sci-fi art-house script
","Jonathan Glazer waited nine years before coming out with his next movie, ""Under the Skin,"" and one wonders why he couldn't have spared us and waited another nine years. The project only shines in the visual department as there's some beautiful cinematography by Daniel Landin, particularly of the Scottish Highlands. Glazer based his script on the novel of the same name by Michael Faber.",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2014,iwatkin,6," Not for everyone...
","Until I read someone's explanation of the opening of the movie, there was no way I was going to understand it. It culminated in an eye (which I kind of anticipated). Beyond that, I was clueless, but knew that I was in for an ""interesting"" 90 minutes.",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2014,RaveReviewerzzz,7," If your open minded give it a try
","I am surprised by the amount of negative criticism about this film as I found it mesmerising and intriguing. If your expecting some Hollywood movie about a sexy alien killing lots of dull characters in a gory and sensationalised way (with lots of explosions thrown in), then you will be disappointed. The pace is slow however I felt that this contributed to the whole feel and atmosphere. I liked the use of Scotland as a setting especially the way it contrasted the natural beauty of Scotland with some of the urban ugliness that exists. I also liked the way Scarlett Johansson played the main role - cool, sexy and almost emotionless. I am glad I didn't watch this at the cinema as watching it at home meant I could discuss the film during the many periods of calm. There were a few arty scenes in the film but I did not feel these were pretentious or contrived, again they added to the feel of the film. The ending was a little disappointing in my opinion but I still feel this film is classy, original and will make most people think!",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2014,postmortem-books,1," If you fall asleep you will have missed nothing.
","At the end of this film someone shouted out ""What a load of old pony"" and a cheer went up from a fair proportion of the audience - that part that either hadn't left before the end or hadn't fallen asleep. To continue the metaphor then this film is up there with the old nag that Steptoe and Son keep in their back yard.",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2014,FlashCallahan,3," Deeply disturbing and ultimately, depressingly pretentious.....
","Johannson plays an alien,who is sent from her planet to harvest Scottish men,because they are the most tasty.",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2014,adrian-15,10," The non-spoiler trailers represents this wonderful movie perfectly
","Did any of the 100+ 'one star' 'worst film ever' reviewers see the trailer for 'Under the Skin'? If they had, they would have known exactly what they were in for. I'm just guessing that the prospect of seeing Scarlett Johansson naked had many of them them throw caution into the wind. And then they felt cheated. Serves them right.",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2014,tedg,," Seduction
","A fair enough way to divide filmviewers is between those that come for a coherent sequence of facts (to call a story) and those that come for an experience induced by any means. Most films address both communities, but grand experiments in contrasting the two can be powerful. For me, the greatest evocation of love in film was ""In the Mood for Love;"" little happens in terms of conventional story. In fact, what story is invoked is in the mind of a science fiction writer and not seen at all in that film, constituting the sequel.",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2017,MihaiSorinToma,2," An extraordinary bad movie

1 January 2015,CinemaClown,," A Reflection On Humanity Through The Eyes Of The Other
","How do you even rate a film when you sort of loved almost everything about it yet have no concrete opinion on what it was all about? It's pretty rare in cinema to find yourself constantly struggling with your very own feelings, unsure of which side to settle with for whenever a step is taken in either direction, something from the opposite end of the spectrum keeps bringing you back in the middle.",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2014,utgard14,4," Stargirl
","Mysterious woman seduces Scotsmen into following her to an isolated house where they're swallowed up by the floor...or something. Pretentious art-house sci-fi movie is dull and borderline incomprehensible. Its only selling point for those who aren't film snobs is that Scarlett Johansson appears naked in it. Admittedly, that's a pretty amazing selling point. But you'll have to sit through lots of wangs and hairy asses as well. There's not much you can say for the acting. Johansson is the only person with significant screen time. Most of that time she is silent and stone-faced. When she does have to speak, she uses a terrible accent that I believe was supposed to be English. It's not a very good movie and certainly not an entertaining one. A surefire favorite among the ""you just didn't understand it"" crowd.",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2013,spacejunk001,," Amazing but not for everyone
","This is a film that will divide audiences, for sure - but, don't forget, so did 2001: A Space Odyssey when it came out. Despite the presence of a mainstream actress, and a science fiction premise, this is an art film 100%, inviting a very subjective response from audiences. Which isn't to say it doesn't have a plot, though. Addressing the confusion of previous IMDb comments - the men that Johansson's alien traps have their innards sucked out and transported through a cosmic portal. One scene makes that pretty hard to miss! The film is about her developing a morality based on her actions, and trying to escape the purpose on earth that she's functioned for, that her overseers (the people on motorbikes - also aliens in human form) make sure she goes through with) ",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2014,UtopianUK,8," Strange and hypnotic.
","With its art house feel, this film delivers something very unconventional and intensely strange. If you expect action and gory horror, you will certainly be disappointed. But maybe you will end up hypnotised by the eerie world Scarlett Johansson traverses. The gritty, bleak environment feels like a mixture of grim reality and shadowy nightmare. At times it feels like a surreal dream you want to wake up from, but one that is so compulsive, you can't resist continuing.",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2014,tomsview,8," Mortal skin
","Although we are used to movies that break from the conventional, thanks to filmmakers such as David Lynch and Denis Villeneuve, Jonathan Glazer's ""Under the Skin"" pushes the boundaries even further. It's a film that allows us to view humanity in another light â€“ the good along with the bad.",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2014,proterozoic,10," It's OK to be different, it's OK to do your own thing.
","Interesting how it worked out for Scarlett Johansson this year: first, a voice-only role in 'Her,' then this one where she's highly visible but says almost nothing. Merge the two, and you have a full-blown talkie.",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2014,rb-66,10," A truly disturbing masterpiece

25 March 2014,bob-the-movie-man,7," Strange, troubling, but artistically special movie
","I was intrigued by this film: the (UK) Times reviewer gave it 5 stars; the Sunday Times reviewer gave it 1 star. Such diversity of view has to be investigated! Let's get one thing straight before we start; Under the Skin is very much an 'art house' film, so don't go and see it if you are looking for a nice, linear 'popcorn' movie. It starts very much in '2001' style (or, actually, Close Encounters style) and the poster commentaries about director Jonathan Glazer ('Sexy Beast') being 'the new Kubrick' are not misplaced. The start is decidedly abstract, as is much of the rest of the film.",/review/rw2986437/?ref_=tt_urv
