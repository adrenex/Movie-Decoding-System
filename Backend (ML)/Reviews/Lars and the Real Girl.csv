10 April 2020,ahmedgorshy,10," Yes yes yes this is the show that I waited for years
","Yes yes yes this is the show that I waited years ago dont tell me about all the boring shows that entered the imdb list like Dragon Ball 1986 and there is not one offer from this great series.
Well, I will be biased towards Laban 10, as long as you are alive. It is not a damn kids show. You will watch and forget it. It is a four-series show, and this series is the best.
Yes, Ben 10 fans are excel at all only because they did not vote enough, because the show did not know enough.
What is this show less than Justice League or Young Justice tell me.
How many unworthy programs earn ratings that exceed 8.5 and they do not deserve 6,0, but only because fans of those programs desire to reach imdb listings and get prizes.
Let's go back a little to Ben 10. In this part, Ben has become ridiculously famous, but it does not matter. Evils were presented in this show like Agrigor and Dagon, a great show.",/review/rw3712843/?ref_=tt_urv

8 March 2011,TheLittleSongbird,9," Not bad at all, in fact it is pretty darn good
","I don't think Ben 10:Ultimate Alien is quite as good as Ben 10:Alien Force, which in my opinion is superb and outdid its predecessor, which I also liked. That said, I wasn't expecting much and I got more than I expected in a good way. Ultimate Alien is not a bad show at all, in fact as I have said already it is pretty darn good.",/review/rw3712843/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2020,kwesib-32179,10," What a great way of keeping consistency.
","The original Ben 10 won the heart of many kids because it introduced a new unique way of writing super hero stories just like how some Japanese mangas do not feel shounen at all, in the case of kimetsu no yaiba, attack on Titan etc. The original was great and went well and could have ended there perfectly. But there was a successor. We all believed that a kids show could not transition into a darker theme. But guess what it did and proved us all wrong.
Alien Force came with a new arc which saw our characters mature. Unique villains were introduced into the system and a bigger cast emerged. Ben's love interest was deeply invested in too. Everything was perfect and it could have ended there but nope, another successor emerged.
Ultimate Alien begun with a bang! The first episode fed straight into one of the franchise's biggest and wildest arc; Agreggor. This meant that even though we wanted AF to end the Ben 10 franchise, we were sucked into a great new arc that changed our minds in UA. Ultimate Alien improved the battle scenes to an overpowered level which for so long Ben deserved. Most of his fight scenes in the previous enabled villains victorious with plot armor since it was a show meant for the younger. But now Ben fights and puts his all into it, causing destruction and shockwaves that his powerful aliens must deliver.
For the Ultimate Aliens, they were the superb factor of the show. Problem is that there are just few ultimate aliens. They also eradicated that silly timer because most of the plot arcs brought powerful and demanding villains such as Eon, Aggregor, Ultimate Kevin, and many others. For me I believe ultimate alien is a great way of at least keeping the consistency of a great franchise.",/review/rw3712843/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2010,mttbowerman9,10," Great
","This new series is a big improvement from the original two series! New villain for the new series, and new conflicts! One thing I have to say is he uses the same characters over and over again. With a new watch and main plot for things they stopped with the old characters and got new ones! The first episode had me excited for the series! With cliff hangers having to wait a week to find out the end! A conflict is always what this show starts and ends with, unlike the other two series. But this one is a huge improvement from the original two, which were also great shows.But overall great series!! Good Friday night show to watch and a good way to start the weekend! This is probably the most popular Cartoon Network show that's on TV. At the moment.",/review/rw3712843/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2011,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,9," Not bad. In fact, it's pretty damn good
","Since I liked the original along with Alien Force, I gotta say that never have I been so impressed when the Ben 10 franchise to make another show. So, I watched some of the episodes and I had a very good time. Looks like Cartoon Network has brought another great TV show made for kids.",/review/rw3712843/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2010,ben_gmeiner,10," Very Entertaining
","I like watching this with my kids. They love the show, the toys, the movies, t-shirts, video games, and any Ben 10 stuff they can get their hands on. I am able to watch and be interested in the Alien Force and Ultimate Alien incarnations. There is good storyline. Not overly mature for kids or too juvenile for teens to enjoy. The characters in the show go through different personal issues with each other as well as working together to fight against a common enemy. They are usually morally correct from my point of view. I DVR every episode and it drove me crazy waiting for my boys to want to watch the finale. It was a lot of fun enjoying it together. I am really looking forward to playing Ben 10 Cosmic Destruction for PS3. Highly recommend the show to dads who want to share something with their sons.",/review/rw3712843/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2017,pefre-19402,10," The best
",Ben may be a little bit cocky but when there is a situation he stands up to it. Ben 10 ultimate alien had some cooler art styles and better in terms of action sequences. The series introduced much stronger and competing villains that helped make Ben better himself over and over again. The introduction if the ultimate too was good. It made Ben super human. Most of the fight scenes in the series are now superhuman and dirtier. ,/review/rw3712843/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2013,OleFr-Skj,8," Thank you, Dwayne
","Much as I like Ben 10 - and I do - Ultimate Alien wasn't really up my alley when I first saw it. I got on board the Ben 10 train around the time when Dwayne McDuffie took over in 2008. I really enjoyed Alien Force (which remains my ""nostalgic"" favorite), and have since gotten around to watching the original series, after this, I was confident Ben 10 was a series I liked.",/review/rw3712843/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2010,Bartunek,9," Not bad
","I was worried about the new season, but have so far seen nothing wrong with it. Not overly obsessed with romance, good mix of action and humor, a bit of drama here and there: the ultimate alien works. Sure, some may argue 'the physics in this show are illogical' blah blah blah. It's a cartoon, made to entice children into watching it. While the children do enjoy the fight scenes that occur often in the show, and no doubt the humor, as well, I believe the show also puts in 'moralistic' type lessons in, as well, to teach the children in the show the difference from right and wrong. Though, thankfully, it's more about the fighting then the learning.",/review/rw3712843/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2020,Animany94,8," Not much new, but still enjoyable.
","While Alien Force was a surprise by adding much more depth to the characters and expanded the world, Ultimate Alien continued in the same vein but didn't add enough to reach its full potential. The angle of having Ben's identity revealed to the public and how it affected his sense of judgement was quickly dropped and not picked up later.",/review/rw3712843/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2011,onlymeandmyguitar,10," Yeess (:
","Everyone says the Ben 10 series's are for boys from 7-12. I disagree. I'm a girl who started watching this when I was what, 9? And I've grown up with this show. I've always been worried about the next season not being as good as the last one, but i've never been disappointed. Good action, good plots, great jokes, awesome for kids of all ages. Maybe to lots of people it isn't good but that's mostly because they didn't grow up on the show! Give it a try! Ben can be very cocky sometimes, which can get on my nerves-and the way that Kevin is always turning bad gets really repetitive. Yet the show is growing up, along with the characters. There is drama for the older kids- action for everyone. It's one of the best shows out there, and I can't wait for the next episode. I just hope that the episodes to come will be creative and unique!",/review/rw3712843/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2011,aasimonline,10," And there was a classic ... an ULLtimate classic in the making
","Honestly, after classics like VOLTRON, THUNDERCATS i thought cartoons were just dying away ... till i accidentally came across BEN 10 (fault of my remote)...then alien force - which began to restore my faith that classic animated shows are out there!!! Ben 10 ultimate alien shows wonderful creativity, deep meaning. Storyline - amazing,entertaining;and once u get hooked, u have the makings of an ultimate classic. Every transformation has good thought done about its powers .. origin and my my some CRAZY TWISTS and TURNS in the series ... Big Chill,Cannonbolt, Echo Echo are among Ben's ULTIMATE TRANSFORMATIONS and you understand a bit about the ULTIMATRIX and the origin of some of Bens' aliens...what Ben can do and struggles to do as well!!! Thank u albedo(and u guys behind the scenes)- this evolution function totally rocks!!!",/review/rw3712843/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2016,syedarshan,10," Awesome My favorite Ben 10 series
",Excellent my favorite Ben 10 Series of all time Ben now having Ultimatrix to turn into Ultimate forms so awesome season and crossover with generator Rex was awesome Kevin jokes and darker tune of show was SO great Ben 10 ultimate alien is my favorite Ben 10 series and they should continue the show with same animation which was very similar to action show in the past of cartoon network. Ben 10 ultimate alien not only bring back old alien and give them ultimate form but reveal more and more backstories back character past after original show ended in 2008 show should have continued Ultimate alien was a perfect shot alien force need and Ben 10 ultimate alien in Season 1 whole Agra's story-line was good then the Kevin being mutated and finally Diagon and vilgax they did really good there and i miss Ben AF/UA Animation,/review/rw3712843/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2021,JWick23,," Probably the best out of the 4..
",Good start. New aliens. Less uncessary drama and more focused on plot and character development. Writing seems better. Probably the best Ben 10 series out of the 4 excluding the reboot. The villians were more complex and 3d dimensional compared to the two previous series. The voice acting and the intro was perfect. And brand new ideas instead of the old and reused ideas.,/review/rw3712843/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2022,mehedi-00330,10," The greatest show ever.

28 November 2021,stefanantonie,10," Ultimates!
","Love the Ultimate aliens in this show, the best one in my humble opinion is the Ultimate Humungosaur! I love how Ben got more mature into this show, it's obvious that the writers realized what's wrong with Ben's personality in the third season of AF and brought Ben's seriousness back. I love the Ultimatrix and Gwen's new look! Another great Ben 10!",/review/rw3712843/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2011,fizzypinnaple_44,8," love to hate it!
","My cousins got me into watching this. I would mostly just talk though the ones they had seen an pick out stupid stuff to make them laugh. But now I find myself addicted to it! When I'm watching it on my own I still pick out the stupid bit and mostly yell at the screen when there missing the obvious, or ripping off old horror movies (the cube... watch perplexahedron again... just no!) An even though i mostly give my lungs a workout I still love this show an I don't know why!!!!........................................................ and now i need to make 10 lines apparently, so please enjoy my life story. 4 scores and seven years ago... i forget the rest but basically I'm Abe Lincoln and i doubt i even got that quote right... sigh",/review/rw3712843/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2010,bluhmfamily,6," Ben 10: Ultimate Alien is an okay show

11 March 2022,Mysterygeneration,8," Still the same, but it's enjoyable.
","This is a fantastic television show. Its theories all add up. It's a lot of fun, and I really wish they'd keep these Ben 10 series going. People nowadays have substituted another child who isn't good enough for the best Ben 10, the one in Ultimate Alien. I sincerely hope this is resurrected on television.",/review/rw3712843/?ref_=tt_urv
