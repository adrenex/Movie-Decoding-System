31 October 2004,vchimpanzee,," Adorable, funny, perfect voice casting for the lead roles
","I thought Billy Crystal and John Goodman were great. I like them anyway, but I can't imagine anyone else in their roles. John Goodman comes across as a warm, fuzzy teddy bear type in so many of his roles, and this time he was actually drawn that way. Crystal and Goodman were great together, even when their characters showed signs of not getting along. And Boo sounded so natural, so childlike. There's no way an adult could have done her lines the way they were executed.",/review/rw1671550/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a very entertaining animated film. I've seen it twice and enjoyed even more the second time. Billy Crystal said he enjoyed making this film as much as any film he's ever done, so that's a good testimony that you'll get some laughs and enjoy this movie as an adult, too.

25 October 2001,jdesando,," `Monsters, Inc.' is the best animated feature this year and one of the greatest of all time.
","You may admire the hair detail on Sully the Yeti's arm, but you will be amazed at the warmth of characterization in `Monsters, Inc.,' surpassing even the great `Shrek' earlier this year. Goodman and Crystal are a comedic team reminiscent of the zaniest Martin and Lewis days. Crystal's Borscht-belt routines brought smiles even to this jaded and admittedly tough-on-comedy critic.  I thought Eddie Murphy's donkey in `Shrek' was smart and funny; Crystal's one-eyed monster is even better with its wry and annoying wit.",/review/rw1671550/?ref_=tt_urv

19 September 2002,TxMike,," Superb animation, a most inventive story, fun for the whole family.
","""Monsters Inc"" came out on DVD this week, and now I have my own copy!! It is not very useful to try to evaluate this one against others since such an evaluation is so subjective. But I put it in the same superb category that such animated films as ""Toy Story"", ""A Bug's Life"", ""Shrek"", and ""Disney's Tarzan"" are in. ",/review/rw1671550/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2002,Spleen,10," The best computer animated film of them all, and the most adult
","Until now I couldn't bring myself to believe that computer animation was the equal of either stop motion animation or hand-drawn animation.  All computer animated films looked a little (usually more than a little) too sterile, many were animated poorly (""Antz"", ""Shrek"", ""Final Fantasy""), and even the single unqualified success (""Toy Story 2"") provided little evidence that a computer animated film COULD reach the heights other kinds of animation could.  ""Toy Story 2"" had flawless character animation, but nothing as inspired as the best in ""Tarzan"" (released the same year, although I could have chosen almost any other Disney cartoon to make my point); effective art direction, but nothing to match ""Fantasia"" or ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".  And I thought that ""Toy Story 2"" was as good as the art was ever going to get.",/review/rw1671550/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2019,jamesrupert2014,9," Monstrously clever and funny early Pixar CGI feature
","Sully and Mike (voiced by John Goodman and Billy Crystal) are employees at Monsters Inc., a scream-fueled plant that provides power to Monsteropolis. Screams are generated by 'scarers' (and Sully is the best), who enter children's bedrooms via the closet and are harvested by their partners (in Sully's case, his best friend Mike). Extreme care must be taken, as children are highly toxic to monsters, so when one is accidently transported to the factory, pandemonium ensues. The film is the fourth of Pixar's full length animated features and like most of the studio's work, is excellent. The story is fun with a clever 'twist' to the ending, the animators manage to inject a tremendous amount of character and personality into the CGI characters, and the choice of voice talent is perfect (I especially liked Steve Buscemi as the chameleonic villain Randall). CGI technology has advanced considerably since the film was released but the imagery still holds up and the vast 'closet door' storage facility is great. Typical of the studio, there are a lot of amusing details in the background that are worth watching for. Good, timeless fun for all ages.",/review/rw1671550/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2001,ahill-1,10," Now here's a story children and adults can relate too. Monsters in the closet.
","While monsters in the closet may seem to be a scary reality for some children, `Monsters, Inc.' makes it light hearted by showing them it's all in a night's work.  The characters are as charming as the cast that speaks for them.",/review/rw1671550/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2019,jackgdemoss,9," The animation even holds up at times.
","I was recently gifted a ""100 movie advent calendar"" for Christmas. When you are ready to watch a movie you scratch one of the boxes off and it tells you what to watch. The first draw was Monsters, Inc. I haven't seen this classic for over 10 years, but my wife was pulling quotes out verbatim. The opening 10 minutes are executed to perfection. The characters are introduced nicely, the plot and obstacle to overcome laid out, the world built, and the comedic timing perfect. The compilation of Mike training Sully with scare exercises had me rolling. The movie does lose steam after this first 10 minutes but it certainly never sputters out. Monsters, Inc. is a classic for a reason, and is a must see.",/review/rw1671550/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," Definitely one of the best films of 2001!
","This was a wonderful movie, with colourful characters, a fun storyline, and a funny and sometimes touching script.(I liked Shrek as well, but I slightly preferred this) I don't think it is quite as good as Toy Story, but I found it an enormously entertaining film, it was much better than I expected. The animation was truly excellent, with colourful and engaging backgrounds, and no stiff movements as far as I could see. I wasn't hugely keen on the song playing over the end credits, but compared to the overall goodness of the film, that is such a minor criticism, and it is fair to say that people have different tastes in music. The script was very, very funny, particularly with the character Roz. The voice talents were fantastic, John Goodman and Billy Crystal were brilliant as Sulley and Mike, Steve Buschemi clearly has a lot of seedy fun as Randall, Jennifer Tilly is wonderfully innocent as Mike's girlfriend, and the late James Coburn is wholly convincing as Waternoose. And I loved the character of Boo, she was so cute, and I loved the ending, people complained it was overly-sentimental but I thought it was so sweet. The story, as is always the case with Pixar films is highly original and charming, and doesn't drag at all. Overall, a wonderful film, truly entertaining and a must-see, and if you are starting to lose faith in Disney and their countless sequels, this is perfect for you. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox.",/review/rw1671550/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2003,MLDinTN,," Funny and creative
","This film had really cool, imaginative animation.  Plus the plot was entertaining.  I liked the idea of children's screams powering Monstropolis, cute and funny.  The little girl, Boo, had such a funny, little laugh.  I liked how all the monster characters had their own personalities.  From the striking colors to the way the hair moved on Sully to the snow blizzard, the CGI was great.   I also liked the expected chase scene because it was  a little different in this movie. Here, Sully, Mike, and Boo travel through doors and come out in different places and out of different doors as they are being chased by the evil Randall as they search for Boo's door.  I just really liked the uniqueness of these scenes.  Also, the final scene was touching, and we get to see how Sully's character transform from a scarer to someone who just wants to make kids laugh.

9 February 2002,Howlin Wolf,7," Light, enjoyable fare that proves animation is still on top...
","... when it comes to producing well-rounded, realised and consistently entertaining movies.  Is it just me or have there been no REALLY awful animated films from the stables of the top studios like Pixar and Dreamworks, etc?  The movie industry as a whole should perhaps sit up and take notice of the craft that goes into these movies.  Both 'suits' and audiences are sure to benefit if that ever happens.  Long may the tradition of quality animated movies be, I say!",/review/rw1671550/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2006,ManyGentleCuttlefish,10," My personal favorite Pixar movie
","Pixar. With only seven movies you've built yourself a reputation as the greatest current animation studio of them all. Dreamworks has made some good ones and 20th Century Fox's movies have made me chuckle a bit, and Disney has gone downhill in recent years. But you can consistently produce quality work with almost no stain on your track record (except A Bug's Life, the one Pixar movie I did not enjoy). But I've lost track of my thoughts.I'm here to talk about Monster's Inc., my personal favorite Pixar movie.",/review/rw1671550/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2005,Pigalina,10," Fantastic
","This film is great. It made me laugh out loud and made me feel sad when I was supposed to too. The monsters all live in a city called Monstropolis and they need the screams of children to power everything. Sully (the big blue furry monster) is the top scarer and he and his one-eyed green friend Mike work together at ""Monsters, Incorporated"" gathering screams. The monsters are terrified of the children however, thinking that if they get touched by a child they will die. One of the children (she ends up being known as Boo) gets into the monster world and everyone goes into a panic. Sully and Mike must return her to her home before she gets caught. Boo is a cute little character and that's a lot coming from me (I am not a huge fan of small children - it may be because she isn't real). There is also an evil creepy monster called Randal who is planning on kidnapping children to harvest as much scream as possible. The animation was great, I am always amazed at the patience that must go into animating hair, Sully is very hairy. As with all Pixar films there are ""bloopers"" during the credits which were really funny. With some of the rubbish that Disney seems to be coming out with (Little Mermaid 2, Jungle Book 2 anyone?), Disney/Pixar has to be the wave of the future.",/review/rw1671550/?ref_=tt_urv

10 June 2007,planktonrules,9," Of all the Pixar movies, this is among the very best
","Aside from TOY STORY II (which I loved), this might just be the best film Pixar has released. It's a really close race between it and THE INCREDIBLES for second best. And considering how wonderful their movies are, this isn't a bad place to finish. Unfortunately for the good folks at Disney, MONSTERS, INC. could not have come out at a worse time. Just days after its release, the even better and more timeless SHREK was released--thereby stealing MONSTERS, INC's thunder and resulting in its just being lost in the shuffle. It's a real shame, though, as this is a wonderful film from start to finish. The voices of the characters were great, computer animation tops and the story line, though silly, worked. But for me, the biggest surprise was that as a jaded adult and very critical person, I loved the cutesy addition to Baby Boo to the film. She was, without a doubt, the cutest thing I have ever seen but also was not gratuitously cute or nauseatingly cute. She was just a perfect addition to an otherwise great film. If you haven't seen this film, get off you behind and see it--it's great stuff and kids as well as adults will love this film.",/review/rw1671550/?ref_=tt_urv
