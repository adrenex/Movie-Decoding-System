30 November 2021,DLochner,8," Incredible! With an important message.
","A Nepalese shows it to the world. Anyone who goes mountaineering themselves can certainly assess the enormous performance of the man a bit better than a layman. Nevertheless, it should be said that great things have been achieved here. And the film shows that too. Perhaps he cannot match the emotional strength of Jimmy Chin with his film Free Solo, but it has an important message in it: Sherpas are the real heroes of the mountains, without them many of the western mountaineers would not be able to climb all the 8,000-meter peaks. Nirmal Purja, a little hero.",/review/rw7628581/?ref_=tt_urv

5 December 2021,paul-allaer,7," Riveting and inspiring documentary--almost too much to take in
","""14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible"" (2021 release; 101 min.) is a documentary about a Nepal mountaineer's seemingly impossible attempt to summit the earth's 14 mountains that are higher than 8000 meters, all in a single season (April through October, 2019). ""Don't be afraid to dream big"", reflects Nirmal Purja, the man at issue. We then go back in time as we learn of Purja's modest upbringing and his eventual joining of the UK Special Forces. Along the way we are also introduced to Purja's family, non more so than his now-ailing mother, who looms over the family's history. At this point we are 10 min into the documentary.",/review/rw7628581/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2021,radhrh,10," Stick your superhero movies up your......
","Nimsdai (Nims ) Purja was born poor in Nepal. He joined the British army Ghurka regiment where he served for six years before joining the elite SBS where he served a further ten years. That would be plenty for most, but not Nims. After his first mountaineering experience in 2014 he decided to climb 14 of the World's highest and most dangerous peaks. This feat had been achieved before but took eight years to complete. Nims Purja attempted it in 7 months! A single climbing season.",/review/rw7628581/?ref_=tt_urv

30 November 2021,brockfal,8," High achievers
","I love films about people taking on great challenges, but this is something else! Gurka Nimsdai Purja and his team of four scale the 14 highest mountains over 8000m, and in just 7 months. Spectacular in every way, it's quite a ride, and though there isn't much time to dwell on the details of climbing the individual mountains so it all feels a bit rushed at times (14 mountains in 110 mins) the film still gives overviews which are illustrated well. You wonder what they'll top this achievement with!!",/review/rw7628581/?ref_=tt_urv

",Loved watching the journey of Nims. He is extraordinary. He truly represented the Nepali climbers and proved himself as a strategic fearless leader.

2 December 2021,austin-19993,5," Too fast, moments not captured
","Was waiting for this since a year, was searching all over youtube for his documentary. When it was finally here, they could have captures the moments and the journey properly. Less then 2 hrs for such once in a life time achievement, its like they show him at the base camp, then in the middle somewhere and then the summit with the date. What about the challenges, difficulties, the whole story about each mountain, and the joy of reaching the summit, how he gathered funds initially. The 3rd phase especially got over even before it started. Such nice photography and pictures but somewhere theres a feeling of incompleteness. You could watch some of the non-netflix youtube videos and how they have captured all the important things.",/review/rw7628581/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2021,new859,10," way better than I expected
","Don't have any expectation when I start watching it. The achievement this guy had is huge. As he said in the movie, if a westerner did what he did, the public recognition would be10 times bigger. I watched many documentaries on mountaineering. All of the movies are telling one peak climbing. And it is already owe inspiring. Now this guy did 14 peaks. I can't help thinking the other climbers are kindergartner comparing to him. He makes climbing mount Everest seems so easy. What he have done is not 10times harder than climbing mount Everest. It's 100 times harder because he has to do 14 peaks within 7 month. I doubt anyone else in the world can do it. As a movie, this movie has a lot to improve. It fails to show the difficulty of climbing these peaks. It's also fails to show why this guy is so strong. Michael Phelps has unique body features. This guy has huge belly. It's against common sense. Scientists need to do some research on him.",/review/rw7628581/?ref_=tt_urv

7 December 2021,dannylee-78082,8," Pushing the boundaries of human capacity
",For anyone who's ever hiked a decent mountain may have a small grasp of what an incredible feat Nims has achieved. It truly is unbelievable. Beautifully made documentary as well. The views at the summit were quite stunning and a handful of people can get footage of those even for just one summit. I really loved that Nims was doing this not because for his own ego but for the representation of his own country. Nothing but the most utmost respect to the man and also whoever made the documentary so that more people are aware of him.,/review/rw7628581/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2021,ayush-kadel,10," Giving up is not in blood
","The new Netflix documentary ""14 peaks : Nothing is impossible"" is highly inspirational story of the Nepali mountaineer Nirmal Purja. It documents his biggest dream to summit all 14 of the world 8000 meter + peaks in just seven months. We also get glimpse of his early days, his physical and mental preparation for this seemingly impossible quest.",/review/rw7628581/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2021,phillpdodds,10," Superhuman
","I've followed Nims' journey on social media for a while so I was expecting something pretty special from this documentary. I'm massively understating it by saying I wasn't disappointed. Nims and his team are nothing short of superhuman. The documentary itself is beautifully presented. Inspiring and emotive. The feat is incredible and downright ridiculous to even consider possible (I mean, who thinks about climbing 3 x 8000m+ peaks in 48 hours?!?!) But the special bond Nims has with his native Nepal and the awareness he brings to viewers as to the special nature of its climbing community is just beautiful. Add to that the film's presentation of the obvious love, pride and respect of his family and it all makes for a very special documentary that pushes the boundaries of what the human body and mind are capable of. He says he'll be back with something bigger next time...how is that even possible?? Well for Nims I guess ""nothing is impossible.""",/review/rw7628581/?ref_=tt_urv
