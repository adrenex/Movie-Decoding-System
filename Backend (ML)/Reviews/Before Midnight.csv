4 June 1999,g-man-22,," Funny, resonant and worth checking out
","This is simply the best ""Big Chill"" movie since, well, ""The Big Chill."" The cast is terrific; the writing is even better.  I've seen Josh Hamilton in several other films, but somehow he never has caught my eye except in this role (interestingly monnikered Grover, by the by).  What makes this film work above the usual rabble of 20-something angst films is that you genuinely understand, can relate to, and feel for the characters.  And the bits of business that have nothing to do with the ""main"" storyline, Grover's, are every bit as amusing and resonant.  Highlights: Eric Stoltz and Carlos Jacott's ""book club.""  Chris Eigeman ducking the ""cookie guy."" Carlos Jacott trying to remember the last ""Friday the 13th"" film.  Any scene involving Parker Posey.  I think I've watched this film about 10 times in completion.  The ending, I've watched about 30 times.  It's that good.  I don't think I've ever seen a more tender, memorable, perfect scene than the parting one between Hamilton and Olivia D'Abo, where she takes out her retainer, smiles shyly at him and then there's a fabulous music cue that leads us into...the unknown.  Of course, we know the ending, because Jane and Grover's fate has basically been the subject of the whole film, but the way Baumbach ties all of this together is truly inspired.  Grover's speech at the airline ticket counter may be the best monologue in the history of cinema.  Am I gushing irrationally here?  Perhaps a little.  But this film needs to be seen and recognized as the little gem (that's often better than anything else in the same genre done by a major studio/director) that it is.",/review/rw6692652/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2006,tobias_lane,10," rare film
","Noah Baumbach's Kicking and Screaming is one of those rare films that actually gets it right when it comes to understanding the angst of being a young adult right out of college. Baumbach's dialogue matches each of the feelings that newly graduated students go through, but doesn't stoop to the level of condescending. We all identify with the characters of Kicking and Screaming whether it is Skippy and his wanting to further his education because there might be something he missed out on or if Skippy doesn't subconsciously want to become his friends Max, Grover, or Otis. We might identify with Max who blatantly doesn't know what to do now. Max's only hellbent on not looking back on his college years, ""I'm nostalgic for conversations I had yesterday. I've begun reminiscing events before they even occur. I'm reminiscing this right now. I can't go to the bar because I've already looked back on it in my memory... and I didn't have a good time."" Kicking and Screaming is a film deserving to be recognize as a journey through the minds of graduates and self-discovery of oneself.",/review/rw6692652/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2009,NumeroOne,7," A self-conscious film that almost manages to be profound
","""Kicking and Screaming"" shows a considerable degree of self-awareness for a film about college graduation directed by a 25-year-old, but it is still an awkward, self-conscious film that is no more confident than its insecure characters. ",/review/rw6692652/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2009,Movie_Muse_Reviews,5," Talk-heavy indie is fresh and witty but boring
","Apparently, I watched ""Kicking and Screaming"" at the perfect time -- not even a month after graduating college. Still, I don't find myself identifying with its characters or empathizing with their struggles other than the basic ""I wish I didn't have to leave."" Granted graduating college is different now than it was in the 1990s, but if this film were truly very good, it would resonate with college graduates of all generations. The problem is that as sharp, witty and original as the dialogue is, it's unnatural and it pushes us toward nothing.",/review/rw6692652/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2003,edawstwin,10," Hilarious, fantastic portrayal of disaffected college grads
","If I had to pick one movie that I was forced to watch again and again, it may be this one.  Not that this is Citizen Kane or The Godfather, it's just that it speaks to me.  Never has anyone dealt with disaffection in such a witty manner.  Every character has something to say on the subject, and it's hysterical.  I really GET all of the characters, even if I can't identify with some of them.  None of the actors appear to be TRYING, which most seem to do in films of this genre.  Josh Hamilton's portrayal of Grover is subtle but outstanding.  Olivia d'Abo is radiant, and (retainer and all), I can't take my eyes off of her.  Chris Eigeman steals every scene he's in, as usual, and missed his calling as a stand-up comedian - he's that funny. Baumbach's use of flashbacks is one of the most effective I've ever seen, and the transitions to flashbacks look amazing.  And finally, this movie is infinitely quotable.  ""Cookie Man, go away"", ""I gotta go - I gotta sleep with a freshman"", ""Jane 2: Electric Boogaloo?"", and ""Oh, I've been to Prague"" still crack me up after 20 or 30 viewings of this film (need the DVD to come out before my tape wears out).",/review/rw6692652/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2000,drocta950,10," The best of its kind
","Kicking and Screaming is easily my favorite film.  It is a funny and intelligent look at the identity crisis that follows graduation.  A brilliant script lifts the film out of gen-x romantic comedy hell.  First time director Noah Baumbach does the impossible by keeping such a talky film constantly moving.  With more insight and heart than most movies, Baumbach has created something timeless.  A must see for all who are scared about taking that next big step.",/review/rw6692652/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2019,patriciogl10,6," Respectable, but easily forgettable.
","When I came across this film, I initially had no idea it was directed by Noah Baumbach. At first is rather difficult to immerse yourself in what is going on inside the screen, because there is no context whatsoever, only dialogue coming from obnoxious pseudo-intellectual grad students.
It is definitely a low start, but Baumbach takes the steer and lets his characters breathe a little, with interaction in small doses among only a few other characters. Their relationships start growing and we finally get a sense of their context, not just time and place but also how everyone relates to one another and how do they feel specifically about youth, growing up, responsibilities and the future. It is only at the middle where things actually get interesting; the handling of dialogue is not great by any sort, but moderate, although not that interesting to begin with.",/review/rw6692652/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2003,teddyryan,," a hidden treat
","KICKING AND SCREAMING is one of the few indie talkathon pictures worth seeing.  It is extremely funny, well-written, and perfectly executed by its cast.  It also displays the magical talent of a man who goes by the name of Stoltz.  Yes, all the perfect ingredients.  And only one way to see it--after graduation.",/review/rw6692652/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2003,george.schmidt,," The best male bonding comedy since ""Diner""
","KICKING AND SCREAMING (1995) **** Josh Hamilton, Olivia d' Abo, Chris Eigeman, Parker Posey, Eric Stoltz, Jason Wiles, Carlos Jacott, Cara Buono. To label this the perfect Generation X film so far would do an injustice to this exceptionally brilliant and dead accurate depiction of twentysomethings embarking upon The Real World and grasping futilely to remain in their comfortable existence at college.  More like an update of ""Diner"" with five college pals griping, searching and dealing with their recent shift of reality with some truly biting dialogue and wholly believeable sequences. Written and directed by Noah Baumbach (who has a cameo in the ""cow f***er"" exchange).  Perfect.",/review/rw6692652/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2012,zetes,5," Not good
","Armond White was right! Noah Baumbach's mother should have had him aborted! Nah, that's more than a little too harsh, but his debut film isn't very good. It shows a bit of promise, since some of the dialogue is okay here, but, overall, this is a talky, indie bore. A bunch of college students graduate but don't know where to go from there. Most of them just hang around campus, drinking and smoking and trying to bed students. The main story surrounds Josh Hamilton and his girlfriend, Olivia d'Abo, who doesn't even tell Hamilton she's going to Prague after graduation. This story is never at all compelling because Hamilton is such an unlikeable little douchebag. D'Abo probably isn't much better, but she's so attractive you can't want her to hang around Hamilton. Eric Stolz and Parker Posey are the most famous actors in the cast. Chris Eigeman has little to do but remind us how much better a director Whit Stillman is. Baumbach made a couple of other indie failures before hitting upon The Squid and the Whale. That and his subsequent two films, Margot at the Wedding and Greenberg, have been very good, so he did finally find his footing.",/review/rw6692652/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 1998,K8-2,," preppie angst fest
","There's a lot of angsting and whining in this movie that I didn't relate to when I was an optimistic college student, but now that I too am joining the ranks of the confused and unemployed post-graduate, I look upon its memory more fondly.",/review/rw6692652/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2006,scotteagan,5," Pseudo Intellectualism
","For an ""indy"" film it is good, but every scene is too long. I'm sure there are a lot of people that can ""get"" this film, but I'm glad I do not have friends like any of these characters. The characters are very boring and intellectual, or at least they think they are, intellectual that is. If you like to pretend you're smarter than everyone else, and enjoy Kaffka references you'll love it. There is one good joke in the movie, and I'm sure it is not original to the movie but it goes: How do you make God laugh? Make a plan. By the end of the movie I was just glad it finally ended, if this was on TV I would have turned it off early.",/review/rw6692652/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2011,jzappa,8," A Wry Gen-X Word Painting
","Like the subsequent work of Noah Baumbach, there's ample wittiness on the face of this debut, but the grief of lethargy prevails, piercing and lucid. Having spent six years at a stunningly insulated school, I could and still can see ample grounds to relate to the four despairing rapscallions of this brittle slice of life, who graduate from college then go on to spend the next several months on or around campus, doing things as trivial as possible.",/review/rw6692652/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 1999,nsexton,3," Good for young college grads, but not for others!!

25 March 2009,ametaphysicalshark,," Devastating look at disaffected college grads
","""Kicking and Screaming"" really depressed me. I'm not sure what I was expecting, having seen only ""The Life Aquatic"" as an example of notable writer-director Noah Baumbach's work (and of course that film was written with Wes Anderson, and directed by Anderson, so I wasn't sure how much of it was Baumbach's), but nothing I read specifically about ""Kicking and Screaming"" lead me to expect what I got: one of the most devastating films ever made, and one which while not on par with stuff like ""The Graduate"" formally, remains one of the very best 'where-is-my-life-going-after-college' movies ever made. It also boasts perhaps the smartest use of flashbacks in a recent American film.",/review/rw6692652/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2006,jay4stein79-1,9," I'm reminiscing this right now...
","I saw this film when it first came out on VHS because it had Eric Stoltz on the cover and, I thought, anything with Eric Stoltz must be good. It was the mid-1990s, after all, and I had first become acquainted with the man through Pulp Fiction--he was so cool! He was also everywhere, even in some particularly banal films (Killing Zoe, anyone?), and, at the time, I grouped this flick with those. ",/review/rw6692652/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 1999,plantboy,10," esoterica
","This is an all-time favorite. Not just for the nuanced performances and witty banter, but because my particular group of friends my senior year of college bore striking resemblances to the ""hawks"" (or ""cougars"" or whatever the hell Skippy wants to call the group). One of our girlfriends actually made the comment, ""you guys all talk the same.""",/review/rw6692652/?ref_=tt_urv

19 November 2015,StevePulaski,8," A film that speaks to millennials by talking their language
","Noah Baumbach does a similar thing with Kicking and Screaming that Amy Heckerling did with her film Clueless of the same year, and that provide the people from high school/college that we loathed seeing every day with some semblance of identification and humanity to make them into people. The people in Kicking and Screaming may indeed be satirized and heavily romanticized versions of people you'd encounter on a liberal arts campus on any given day - and for me, currently attending a liberal arts school, this one hit a bit too close to home - but their commonalities with their real life counterparts that you can't deny the satirical dial isn't turned up all the way past human recognition.",/review/rw6692652/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2007,jamesonnephi,4," A waste of time for anyone who values their time and brainspace
","This movie is not great. It is an accurate portrayal, nothing more. All the characters are the clichéd prototypes of college life, all those who are interesting for the first part of school but get gradually more and more annoying as semesters plug on. And eventually, you no longer really want to spend time with them, because they are going no where and doing nothing, and haven't their entire ""career"" as students. Its just a bunch of high schoolers without boundaries or parents, and it isn't art, or even interesting once the initial humor and novelty wears off and the realization comes: this movie is the people I hate. Because they are pretentious posers unwilling to put forth the dedication necessary to become masters of any craft, much like the director at the time when he made this. Hopefully he will at some point, The Squid and the Whale is at least moving in the right direction.",/review/rw6692652/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 1999,Tito-8,8," Succeeds as a drama
","It took me quite a while to warm up to this movie, but once I finally did, I was sad to see it end.  I found that too much of the beginning of this film was mildly amusing but lacking in character development.  Once I got to know a little more about the people in this film, this film really took off.  The scenes with Grover and Jane really stand out as the best in the movie, and I would have to say that this film works MUCH better when the emphasis is not on the comedy.  The comedic moments were generally appealing, but were not nearly enough to make this film stand out, nor did they make me laugh very often.  This movie was best when it tried to be serious, and I must confess that the bittersweet ending is one of the best that I've ever seen.  As a comedy, I'd call this an average movie, but as a drama, I strongly recommend this film to one and all.",/review/rw6692652/?ref_=tt_urv

","Upon writing, deleting, and re-writing comments, one thing has become clear to me.  The movie is funny.  It twist sharp wit with comical character mannerisms.
