22 February 2020,jamesjustice-92,6," This is NOT Star Trek
","After the greatest disappointment that was Discovery I had really high hopes for this one, especially after hearing that Patrick Stewart will return to reprise his iconic role he seemed to have abandoned long time ago and after watching 5 of the show's 10 episodes I have to admit that this is just as crappy as Discovery. A good show is supposed to present the characters you will sympathize with, root and care for, find something in common or at least anything - Picard does not have any of those characters. Even the titular JL is wasted and you just don't see him shine as brightly as he once was. Patrick tries his best to be Jean-Luc but after half of the first season I just don't see him in this role anymore. Overall the show is completely different from what you would expect from Star Trek: it doesn't have the depth, good characters, well-written stories and anything to think about after the episode is over. The original series was a masterful show, the Next Generation was a glorious comeback and superb continuation, Deep Space Nine was good in its own way, Voyager was a nice touch to expand the universe and Enterprise was a beautiful way to end the saga with the beginning. After that there were no Star Trek series no matter how frequently the writers and producers are eager to call them that. Picard is another piece of garbage that parasitizes on a great idea adding its nonsense into a fully grown and finished masterpiece no one asked for. I give it a six only because of Sir Patrick and the fact that I haven't finished the season yet and I think I'm not going to.",/review/rw8036210/?ref_=tt_urv

10 May 2020,xTkAx,," Tried very hard to like it.
","Star Trek Picard started out all right for the first episode. By the 2nd episode, it started to become obvious that this was never going to be as good as the Star Trek shows and movies between 1966-2005.",/review/rw8036210/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,cherold,8," Season 1, terrific. Season 2, snoozefest
","I thought Picard season 1 was absolutely great. Then season 2 came, and it immediately put me off with an episode that seemed to be more about Picard's emotional state than, you know, space, frontiers, that sort of thing.",/review/rw8036210/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2020,tom992,9," This is so good! Finally they got it right.
",I'm giving this show a 10/10. From the start on you now that they put in a lot of work! After seeing the first episodes I can say that there is a good story line and tho Picard is older he has still got it! He gets involved in another mission (mystery) and he wants answers. And there is the fire in Picard we all know. I can honestly say that my Trekkie heart is full of joy after watching this! Enjoy every moment!,/review/rw8036210/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,9," Way better than I'd expected.
","In these days where returns, reboots and long standing shows all seem to be going down the shoot, Picard does the reverse, I watched a few episodes and totally enjoyed them, this has been a huge surprise as I was unsure what to expect.",/review/rw8036210/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2022,lord_orsum,6," Could be good if not for the lazy writing

23 January 2020,DJNormand,9," Great new beginning for Picard
","Someone wrote ""what were they thinking"" because Patrick Stewart will be 80 this year. Well, he still has the Picard character and now even more so fully. I thought he was brilliant. It looks like a great beginning to a fantastic story that most Trekkers will want to see no matter Patrick's age. As a 61 year old Trekkie I remember when Star Trek was in prime time in the 60s as a child. I've loved every minute of every Trek interpretation. But Picard was always my favorite Captain. I'm willing to give this show every opportunity to succeed if the millennials can get on board and get over the ""ageism"" complex. The extra supporting cast are many of my favorites as well, especially Santiago Cabrera from The Musketeers. So I'm stoked about the entire show. I hope CBS will give it a chance and not cancel it midway through. Here's hoping. And thank you for bringing back Jean Luc Picard. May he live long and prosper.",/review/rw8036210/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2020,Bosrs1,10," Same Picard! But definitely not where we left him...
","Before I start my recommendation is to go into this completely spoiler free. Don't listen to any of the nonsense about political agendas or the like as they're not being written by anyone whose seen the show. Got to see a pre screen of the first 3 episodes though I'm no critic or studio person, just a fan. It's not a super dark take on the future that the Children of Mars short leads some to believe (think of that short as a Wolf 359 or a Dominion War moment that is many years in this show's past that informs what happens but doesn't define it).",/review/rw8036210/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2021,dragracer1260,6," Dissapointing from a Trekkie
","I can't understand why a show like Firefly gets cancelled and rubbish like this is supposed to take its place. If the TV exec's think that us old Trekkies will watch this just because of a few of the original actors then they are very sadly mistaken. I've tried, really tried to watch it but it just not going anywhere, where is the sci-fi ?. Don't take my word for it, you have to give it a go yourself but DON'T get suckered into paying for it.",/review/rw8036210/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2020,sbulgacs,8," Good But Not Perfect
","Having just finished the first episode I can say that I enjoyed it. There were no wtf? Moments as occurred with the first episode of Discovery. It was great to see Patrick Stewart return to the role of Jean Luc Picard. The first show basically introduces the characters and sets the scene for what will effectively be a 10 hour movie. There is nothing especially revelatory going on, other than explaining Picard is not the man he was due to a series of tragic events starting with the loss of his good friend Data. I notice some saying this isn't the same Picard we were used to seeing on TNG. Well obviously not, 20 years have passed and life has taken its toll on the character. That's actual reality! What did these people want a rehash of their favourite TNG episodes? Well I can categorically state most of us Trekkies absolutely did not want that. There's also absolutely no politics in this first episode, other than a reference that Picard makes to the Federation failing. How it's failed I'm sure will transpire in future episodes. So you can take all the reviews here about it being anti Trump and Brexit at this stage as complete made up nonsense. Just as Discovery I'm looking forward to seeing how this show plays out.",/review/rw8036210/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2020,borislav-us,10," 'Earl Grey. Decaf'
",I avoided reading any reviews prior to watching the first episode. I think it was good decision as it would have inevitably either set my expectations high or disappointed me in some way.,/review/rw8036210/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2020,mattturner-17923,10," Make it so.......
",I grew up watching Next Generation and was apprehensive about Picard. I was so wrong. The first episode was wonderful. A perfect mix of nostalgia and a more edgier feel. Picard and Data are back together and all is well. I feel like a kid again. Definitely gonna watch this show and I recommend you do as well. Engage.,/review/rw8036210/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2022,dth-78499,6," Too much prattle
","I enjoyed the first series but the second one was far too wordy and full of silly introspection. It had its moments when it did the ""Star Trek"" thing and it was watchable and good but that was hidden in a lot of unfollowable rubbish.",/review/rw8036210/?ref_=tt_urv

",And that's the problem. If you have to try and like a show or the only reason you keep watching is because you're hoping it will get better then you're just wasting your time. I really loved the Star Trek series as a child and was hoping this would make me feel the same way but it did not. It's slow and boring and I just couldn't like any of the characters and the story is just meh.,/review/rw8036210/?ref_=tt_urv
