3 May 2009,ccthemovieman-1,9," Winslet Impressive In This Two-Movies-In-One Story
","Kate Winslet is just outstanding in this very interesting film that is almost two stories-in-one. The first part is a sexual story of an older woman having affairs with a teenage boy and the second part is her war crimes tale and what happens afterward. The first is a somewhat happy jaunt of a short story and the second is a very serious and depressing story. That's where Winslet really shines. Obviously, she's developed into an an outstanding actress.",/review/rw1997677/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2009,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," Never underestimate the power of guilt
","Kate Winslet, I absolutely adore her, she's my favorite actress of all time. I still can't believe that she hadn't won an Oscar, her first nomination was in 1995 with Sense and Sensibility. Finally after 14 long years, she finally won the coveted award with the movie The Reader. I finally was able to see this movie the other day and it blew me away, I'm still debating if this really was my favorite Kate Winslet performance, but once again with a strong cast telling a powerful story, The Reader was definitely one of the best films out of 2008. So many holocaust films have been made, it's hard to make another that stands out, but we really haven't had a story where the Nazi guards were on trial. A lot of people debate if this movie is trying too hard to push sympathy on Kate Winslet's character, but my love for this film is to just show that they were human as well, hard to believe, but that our mothers, sisters, friends, whoever could have done something so shameful.",/review/rw1997677/?ref_=tt_urv

24 January 2009,jaredmobarak,7," Only one thing can make a soul completeand that one thing is love  The Reader
","What is guilt? I believe this is the central question behind Stephen Daldry's new film The Reader. Based on the novel by Bernhard Schlink, the story asks its audience what a true monster is. If you know a secret, one that could exonerate someone from being found guilty of murder, should you help her even though you know she's accepted her guilt despite being unable to stop it? What if that person was someone you loved? There is some heavy material thrown about in the second half of this film, emotions run high and people must make decisions concerning some very dire situations. One thing is for sure, though, once that decision is made, no matter which side of the fence you fall on, some shred of guilt, some feeling of remorse, is inevitably going to follow you around for the rest of your life. This is what we call being human, because as Bruno Ganz's Professor Rohl says, ""our justice is governed by laws, not morals."" It doesn't matter whether something was right or wrong, it's whether it was legal or illegal. Unfortunately our souls don't work that way.",/review/rw1997677/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2009,Michael Fargo,10," A victim's guilt
","The film is a series of profound moral dilemmaswhile contrived by the author, they are fair questionsthat resonate deeply in the 21st Century: The role of guilt in victims, perpetrators, individuals and collectively, as well as justice, forgiveness, redemption, shame and, of course, literacy and its role in Western thought.",/review/rw1997677/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2017,lee_eisenberg,10," I read it in German
","While taking a German course in undergrad, I read Bernhard Schlink's 1995 novel ""Der Vorleser"" (which more accurately translates to ""the narrator""). I naturally thought that it would make an interesting movie. Sure enough, they eventually made one. It took me several years before I got around to seeing it, but now I have.",/review/rw1997677/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2010,weltraumpirat,10," An insight into the humanity of the inhumane
","Before I start reviewing, let me say something personal: As a German, one can hardly watch movies about the Holocaust, WWII or any related topic unbiased. As I have discovered myself, no German family is without a history related to the Third Reich, almost none are without grave guilt, or at least the fear thereof, and most who say otherwise either lie knowingly, or simply try to evade further inquiry.

14 October 2017,classicsoncall,8," ""It doesn't matter what I think. The dead are still dead.""
","Wow, I don't know what to make of this picture. It's so good as a fictional story that it feels like it could be a true one. It presents many moral dilemmas, not the least of which is it's treatment of Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) as almost a sympathetic character when in reality she was something of a monster. During her trial, Hanna uses a standard defense used by many former Nazi defendants who stated that they were merely doing their job in whatever capacity they were employed. In one respect, one could almost make the case that there was an element of mental illness involved in her make up, particularly when she comments on why she didn't allow the prisoners in the burning church an opportunity to escape and survive. There's that, and Hanna's overwhelming obsession to keep her illiteracy a secret, to the extent of taking the fall for the other women on trial with her who may have had even more culpability, if that were even possible.",/review/rw1997677/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2009,blanche-2,9," Evil often has a human face
","Directed by Stephen Daldry and written by David Hare, ""The Reader"" is a thought-provoking and surprising drama that takes the viewer in several different directions. Though some reviewers on this site are critical of Daldry and the film, in lesser hands, ""The Reader"" would be a total, erratic mess.",/review/rw1997677/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2009,Buddy-51,9," Powerful Holocaust drama
","Like all works of art that endeavor to ""illuminate"" the Holocaust, ""The Reader"" ultimately finds itself looking for answers where none can be found. Yet, the beauty of the film is that it seems to acknowledge the impossibility of its task. Thus, rather than trying to resolve all the issues it raises, the movie simply lays them out before us, trusting that, in the final analysis, we will be able to come to our own conclusions about what, if anything, it all ""means.""",/review/rw1997677/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2009,The_Film_Addict,10," The Reader is a brilliant, sexually charged, and oddly heartbreaking tale about the complexity of human morality and the lifelong repercussions that result from our actions.
","There's an urgency in human nature to understand. When it comes to the Holocaust, history's bleak, unsettling period, it doesn't matter what book you've read, film you've seen or account you've heard; in the end, your response it halted by its incomprehensible conclusion. How could humanity course its way towards such a violent, destructive path? How could people knowingly send men, women, and children to their impending doom? Most puzzling, how could the world allow it? Even though its been 63 years since the blood-drenched annals of World War II, its aftermath today is still bone chilling.",/review/rw1997677/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2009,hopek-1,10," A thoughtful and plausible examination of guilt.
","Very well acted and presented and a faithful representation of the main points of the novel on which it is based. This film encourages us to look closely at very difficult issues surrounding the atrocities of World War II. I am at a loss to understand why so many critics have been so damning of it. Perhaps it is too subtle for them to understand. It seeks to outlaw the false and intellectually lazy theory to explain the holocaust, namely that the horrors were committed by monsters. In its place we are offered contextualization, not as excuse but as explanation of how quite ordinary people were able to do extraordinarily dreadful things. We avoid these uncomfortable facts at our peril.",/review/rw1997677/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2009,aharmas,10," What Did We Learn?
","Stephen Daldry knows how to tell a story, knows how important it is to  make each of those characters relevant and indispensable, more  importantly, emotions are finely portrayed, but it is the cerebral  quality of his work that both impresses and irritates the audience.  Somehow, he let go of his control and made ""Billy Elliot"" exuberant and  glorious, with each note and emotion spilling out of the screen. His  restraint might have lessened the impact of the dark nature of the  tragedy in ""The Hours""; somehow the balance continues in ""The Reader"",  a powerful testament to the complexity of humans and their  interactions. In ""The Reader"" learning occurs, consequences, origins,  and motivations are carefully explored and analyzed, leaving out some  of the mystery for us to decide. Choice is key here, and some choices  are carry a bigger weight than others.  The marvelous Kate Winslet, who should be honoured for the quality of  her work, with as much recognition as it is humanly possible portrays  the central character of the story, a woman whose life might have been  shaped by unfortunate events, mostly undisclosed to us, and some of her  own genetic makeup. We, as the lawyers and the students in the film,  get to evaluate the evidence and choose to make a statement to justify  hers and our own ethical standpoints. It is the intricate and deft  interpretation of Hannah that anchors the story. Although, the story  follows Michael and their relationship from his teenage years to the  devastating conclusion, the film succeeds because Winslet is able to  show every bit of the confusion, rationale, and emotion that her  character possesses. She seems cold and detached, but as we look, we  discover that there is more to her than we can see from the moments we  see her on the screen. Hannah carries secrets inside her soul, somehow  keeping herself alive, surviving, living an austere existence that  hypnotizes, seduces, and repulses those she encounters.  Michael is seduced by this mysterious woman, and his own future is  shaped by those moments they spend together. What he doesn't realize is  how big of an effect their time together will have on his life. Their  early scenes are powerful and presented with a strong sense of realism  and brevity. They're probable the best of the film and might have to be  reviewed to understand how key they are to the further growth of  Michael's life and reactions to others. Winslet does not say much, but  her manipulations provoke her desired effects.  As their paths diverge and meet, their relationship changes as one  observes the dramatic turn of events that brings them together again,  and how Michael's actions have dire consequences for both of them. It  is during this period that we think we begin to see how relative  everything: what is moral and immoral, logic and emotional, simple and  complex. Highs and lows are hit again, as we become more involved in  one of the most powerful and dramatic moments of their lives.  In the final act of the film is when Winslet and Feines do some of  their most outstanding work ever; she even surpassing her masterful  turns in ""Revolutionary Road"", and ""Eternal Sunshine"". Every gesture,  every look, every enunciation add details and shed light to who they  were, are and might become. It is subtle work, haunting, and  bewitching, the work very few people are able to do.  ""The Reader"" reaches its amazing conclusion with a couple of scenes  that might break whatever little strength we might still have left.  ""The Reader"" isn't an important work, but it is a work that should be  recognized by the quality of its work, a finely tuned and produced  piece of cinema by people who recognize how magical, powerful, and  intelligent films can be.",/review/rw1997677/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2009,Hitchcoc,9," Incredebly Balanced
","This is an amazingly believable film. The types of dilemmas faced by the characters are the kinds of things that easily could have happened. There's pride and anger and self doubt. This is really a story about a man who has been shaken loose from innocence, who must face the fact that someone he loved or thought he loved could have been a monster. Still, even if she was a monster, we cannot totally condemn her. Kate Winslet is incredible from the sexually driven streetcar conductor to the perpetrator of an event that killed hundreds of Jews. The amazing thing is that she can't get her mind around what she has done. She saw it as a way to find work since everyone was at war and she needed the employment. She is painfully honest which is hard to fathom for the courts. Roy Fiennes has a connection to her because of their affair, but he is still repulsed by the events. Because of his basic human kindness he continues to read to her as he did by recording books on audio tapes (he comes to realize that she can't read or write). There are not simple answers and no last minute discovery; it's about people trying to connect. This is a fine film.",/review/rw1997677/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2011,planktonrules,9," The most morally neutral film I can ever recall having seen.
","This is a very strange movie in that there are MANY moral dilemmas and situations that clearly are unsavory--yet the film takes a completely neutral stance in presenting the plot. I am sure this offended some but it did make for a very memorable film. As for me, I am still not sure what I think about this strange style of film making.",/review/rw1997677/?ref_=tt_urv

",The Reader is one of my favorite movies from the year 2008. It is incredibly complex in the way you react to the characters of the movie. It carries many emotions from sensuality to anger all the way back to that of sympathy and resolution. Many moves advertise themselves as unbiased and fair but nothing gets close to that like The Reader which is able to build sympathy for a character you would never think you could feel towards.,/review/rw1997677/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2008,Chris Knipp,7," Storytelling troubles
","This isn't meet-cute. Fifteen-year-old schoolboy Michael Berg (David Kross) first encounters his 36-year-old future lover Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) by throwing up in her doorway. It's a dismal rainy day in a German city in 1958 and he has taken ill on the way home from school. She cleans him up and accompanies him to his family. He turns out to have scarlet fever, and is kept at home for months. Once he's well again he goes back carrying a bunch of flowers to thank Hanna for her kindness, but realizes he's turned on, and bolts in embarrassment while she's bathing. Eventually Michael returns and happily loses his virginity. A regular ritual of reading, bathing, and lovemaking develops between him and Hanna. He reads to her; she bathes him; the sex is mutual. She is a tram conductor with a harsh manner, and several huge secrets. She seems to be using Michael, but she's also enjoying him mightily, and he is reaping enormous rewards, though his affair puts pressure on his relations with family and schoolmates.",/review/rw1997677/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2009,moutonbear25,8," A Great Read
","We don't know. We think we do but we don't. We make decisions or sometimes decisions are made for us but we think we've made them. Then suddenly, there we are. We can't be certain how we got there or where we will be when everything settles but we do know that we are alive. Some experiences are life altering and we can run from them or embrace them. Staying to see them through though can bring incredible bliss but also tormented turmoil. We just never know. One such experience was had by a young Michael Berg (David Kross) and is chronicled in Stephen Daldry's THE READER. How could he know that when he pulled into an alley to be sick that he would meet the woman who would shape his entire life? How could he know that getting close to her would pull him the furthest he's ever been from himself?",/review/rw1997677/?ref_=tt_urv

","Okay, now I've seen the two simultaneous Winslet movies. Both are celebrated. Both seem to understand Kate's gift as an actress  that she is one of those rare players who can convey what a character does and also, via another channel, what she thinks or rather what motivates what she does. Its what I've called folded acting, with that second layer being a direct communication with the audience that annotates the first.",/review/rw1997677/?ref_=tt_urv
