","Avan Jogia does an all around phenomenal job with Door Mouse. The film starts out the gate with stunning visuals and a killer soundtrack (with both only getting better as the film goes on). The beautiful color grading and well-timed graphic novel components combine to create a world that's so familiar, yet just out of reach.",/review/rw8801273/?ref_=tt_urv
