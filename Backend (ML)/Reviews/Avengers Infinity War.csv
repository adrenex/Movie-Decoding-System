24 January 2021,RJBrez,10," Best movie of the MCU, incredible from start to finish.
","Infinity War is remembered mostly for how it ends, with good reason. But for me, the entire movie is incredible. Action, humor, cinematography, heartbreak, etc. It was a culmination of 10 years of character development. The benefit of that hard work? The movie can start with incredible action and never let up. Most wouldn't agree because of the ending, but I feel it's the best movie of the MCU (so far). Endgame was awesome, infinity war was better. I think the best part of it was the fact that we had so many cool character meet ups that as fans we never thought we'd see. Thor with the guardians? Wow. Star Lord and Iron Man? Rocket and the winter soldier? We could go on and on. They also mastered the art of humor to help offset some deep deep hurt throughout the story. Thor and Star Lords interactions are pure gold. Thor calling Rocket ""rabbit"" pure gold. Dr Strange and Tony going toe to toe is worth the price of admission as well. I'm going to stop now or I could type forever.",/review/rw4201100/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Great
","This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.",/review/rw4201100/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2021,Alex_Lo,10," Best Cliffhanger of all Time
","A meticulously planned film down to the last detail, where you can see how much love is behind it. Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out. Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars.",/review/rw4201100/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2021,andreascaloni,9," EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER
","Avengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Joe and Anthony Russo create a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking.",/review/rw4201100/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2021,grztxks,10," Better than Endgame
","Infinity war is one of the best MCU protects. It has a great story, great acting, and awesome looking. If you aren't a Marvel fan or haven't watched most of the previous MCU movies this however, won't be something for you. Let's start with Thanos, definitely one of the best villains, he has a motive, is well played, you can even say that Infinity war tells his story and not the story of a hero. But also most of the other cast members were great in their role and again, if you love Marvel, watch this movie.",/review/rw4201100/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2021,Abdulxoxo,8," A superior avengers sequel
","Although this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by.",/review/rw4201100/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2021,Filmdokter,8," It all led to this: superhero film at its best
","#MCUrewatch. A confrontation that has been in the making for dozen of films. Thanos finally arrives. And boy he doesn't disappoint. He is by far the most interesting MCU villain: strong, nuanced and perfectly performed by Brolin. This really is HIS movie. The film has a train like speed and one impressive sequence is followed by the next. Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...). As a stand-alone film it might not be as good as some others but as a showcase of what MCU has achieved, it has never been better.",/review/rw4201100/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2021,uzair-36867,10," To this day one of the most impossible films to pull off

21 April 2021,Puroo,10," How MCU should have always been like
","It was only after the release of Infinity War that I got interest in MCU. Before that I wasn't very much into superhero movies. So a couple of months after this movie released, I skimmed through all the MCU movies from Iron Man to Black Panther. I didn't put much focus into watching them all, since most of them were just following one pattern. Iron Man? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Captain America? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Thor? A guy ""loses"" and then gets superpowers, beats the bad guy and saves the day. Even in The Avengers and Age of Ultron it's just ""now all those guys come together, beat the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and save the day"". But Avengers: Infinity War is very much different.",/review/rw4201100/?ref_=tt_urv

","A wonderful movie and the action scenes in the film are some of the most wonderful, especially in the Battle of Titan. I liked the fact that Thanos was capable of defeating all the battles in the film and he did not use a plan and the end was sad, especially the death of Spider-man",/review/rw4201100/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2019,michaelhowell12,10," Way better than endgame
","This film is way better than endgame!
The actions better
The writings better
The dialogues better
The cgi is better
More shocks and more emotional.
Watching both in the cinema , the reactions to this in cinema was unbelievable compared to endgame. Dont get me wrong endgame is good but to say its the best marvel film is jus marvel fan boys being stupid.
I just dont see how people are saying endgame is the best marvel film when theres clearly other marvel films better than it!
But trust me this is the film that changed the mcu , lol maybe it because i wanted them to lose because thanos is badass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",/review/rw4201100/?ref_=tt_urv

","I consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations. ",/review/rw4201100/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2021,eva3si0n,8," The first Marvel film I really liked
","The first Marvel film I really liked. Surprisingly in the film there are many spectacular scenes, which are well held and the main transition between them is made seamless, which does not make you miss. And the main thing that surprises the film - the ending, it really makes it clear that Marvel now plays big, since began to break up with the main heroes of the giving films.",/review/rw4201100/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2018,shawneofthedead,10," This movie will blow your mind and break your heart - and make you desperate to go back for more. Brave, brilliant and better than it has any right to be.
","Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. ",/review/rw4201100/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2021,miacoop,10," Amazing
",With Thanos come into play you think that the avengers would be able to tackle this problem but no. After re-watching Infinity War multiple times it still gets me because it's sad the ending really is just another cinematic masterpiece which Marvel always pull off and the fight scenes are amazing. Marvel have some of the best actors and the best casts I'm not applaud them for that. No mad Steve was just sexy after mate and I loved it a lot.,/review/rw4201100/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2018,TheLittleSongbird,9," Extravagant clash of the titans
","Have found myself liking or loving a lot of Marvel's previous work, while finding a few faults with most. It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me.

",It's great film apart from 5 minutes of utter stupidity in writing and directing. Who or how or why does one no see that they make him go to sleep so they have every opportunity to just kill him or chop his arm off or anything they want to stop him. Why would no one think that's a ridiculous thing to put in the movie. Just really gets on my nerves.,/review/rw4201100/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2021,cartermain,," A film that pulled off the impossible.
","Avengers: Infinity War is a film that should be utter crap. A franchise stretching almost twenty films is unheard of. And making a great and satisfying climax to that franchise is nearly impossible. Considering how many characters Marvel had to juggle together with this movie, there was almost no way this movie wouldn't suck.",/review/rw4201100/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2021,Dello_,10," The standard for every crossover movie
","Though this is not my favorite MCU movie I think ""Infinity War"" is the best product the studio produced both because of the really high scope and because of the execution itself. I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in ""Endgame"" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly ""Infinity War"" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn't have asked for more.",/review/rw4201100/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2021,numenorsniper-66396,9," Marvel's best
","I saw Iron Man in the cinema when it first released in 2008, and still remember it being ground-breaking and awesome. Since then I kind of lost interest in Marvel movies in general, as their quality was very variable, with a few gems here and there. Ultimately in hindsight, the MCU is a really fun and generally well-made series of movies, with the persistent flaw of deflated stakes, contradicting rules and muddled plot points. Not quite brainless entertainment per se, but sometimes feels like that.",/review/rw4201100/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2018,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,8," Breathtaking
","Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It's a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields. ",/review/rw4201100/?ref_=tt_urv
