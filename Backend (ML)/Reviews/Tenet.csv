24 September 2022,CinemaSerf,5," Blonde
","What a truly disappointing film this is. It offers us a really slow, sterile and disjointed - almost episodic - depiction of just how Marilyn Monroe's life might have panned out. For a start, I couldn't decide whether Ana de Armas was really Lady Gaga or Scarlett Johansson (both of whom would have acquitted themselves better, I'd say) as she offers an admittedly intense, but remarkably uninvolved performance. We move along from chapter to chapter in her life hindered by some fairly weak and uninspiring dialogue and seriously intrusive scoring in what becomes an increasingly shallow and lacklustre fashion. The photography does try hard - it does offer us a sense of intimacy, but the whole thing is presented in such a stylised and un-natural manner that it is frequently difficult to tell whether she is/was a ""real"" woman. Her marriages are treated in an almost scant manner - and her relationship with JFK is reduced to something rather implausibly one-sided and sordid showing nothing of how their relationship might have come to be. It has no soul, this film. Aside from her glamour - which was, even then, hardly unique we are not really introduced to any of the nuances of her character, we are left guessing a lot of the time as to just how she did become such a superstar, and how she spiralled so inevitably into a maelstrom of booze and pills. It relies to a considerable extent on the viewer's existing knowledge of, and affection for, this flawed lady. Adrien Brody and Bobby Cannavale don't really have much chance to add anything as her husbands and the highly speculative relationship between her and Charlie Chaplin Jnr (Xavier Samuel) and his sexually ambiguous partner-in-crime Edward G Robinson Jr (Scoot McNairy) does suggest something of the rather profligate and debauched existence that some lived in Hollywood, but again their characters are also largely undercooked and again, we are largely left to use our own imagination. It is far, far too long and in a packed cinema, I could see people looking at the ceiling just once too often. Watchable, certainly, but a real missed opportunity to offer us something scintillating and tantalising about this most of iconic of women.",/review/rw8575114/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,arungeorge13,4," A disjointed, episodic look at Monroe's miseries! [+42%]
","""Blonde"" is sadly reduced to the collective tragedies (and horrors) that the iconic actress went through in her short 36-year-old life. Don't get me wrong, Ana de Armas totally owns the role and gives it her all (God bless her cheekbones!). She also gets worthwhile support from the cinematography, production design, costume, and make-up departments. The biggest letdown is the script that heavily lacks connective tissue between what feels like various disjointed episodes in Monroe's life. Again, each of these episodes are stripped down to repetitive plot-points such as the absentee father, the abortions, the failed marriages, and most importantly, the male gaze.",/review/rw8575114/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,marcelbenoitdeux,5," Poor Marilyn
","If you're going to fictionalize the life of one of the movie icons of the 20th century why go there, to the darkest dark. There are some ""invented"" moments that are, quite frankly, unforgivable. What kept me glued to the screen was Ana de Armas. A tremendous show of talent and fearlessness. I was wondering what the experience would have been to watch it in a theater with other people? I don't know because in the privacy of my own home I was free to stand up and walk away to pour myself a drink and shout at the screen. The awful Kennedy episode for instance. Why? That episode in particular made me question the intention of the filmmakers. So, yes, I can say now that I've seen it. Loved some it and detested some it.",/review/rw8575114/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,ferguson-6,7," buck up for this one
","Greetings again from the darkness. For those who have studied Marilyn Monroe's personal and professional life, writer-director Andrew Dominik's (first feature film since KILLING THEM SOFTLY, 2012) interpretative adaptation of the 2000 novel by Joyce Carol Oates may send them into the early stages of shock. In fact, regardless of one's level of knowledge of the details of Marilyn's background, shock and bewilderment are likely reactions. It should be made clear for all viewers that it's a fictionalized account of her life, not a true biography. One should also know that this is cinematic artistic mastery to complement an incredibly in-depth and revolutionary performance from Ana de Armas (KNIVES OUT, 2019, NO TIME TO DIE, 2021).",/review/rw8575114/?ref_=tt_urv

","Blonde was already one of the most controversial and hotly debated films of the year before it hit Netflix, and therefore became available to the public at large. That's happened within the last day or two, and I expect that will blow up the discussion and discourse around it even more. It's probably going to be what most film news sites or discussion groups focus on for the next week or two, and maybe longer if it ends up earning some nominations for the upcoming awards season.",/review/rw8575114/?ref_=tt_urv

28 September 2022,adibshahriar,7," Mixed feelings
",Ana de armas gave an inspiring performance and she really acted her heart out. The story and it's execution was a masterpiece at places and the cinematography and aesthetics were on a new level. As I don't know that much about marlyn I don't actually care how they portrayed her. The main accomplishment of the film is that it shows the horrors of Hollywood masterfully and how sometimes famous people or actors lose themselves as a person underneath the limelight and become somewhat of a lost soul. In some respects they failed to make it feel impactful and it seemed disjointed sometimes. But to see ana de armas act her heart out and netflix do something new is truly refreshing. And it's such a long film but surprisingly didn't seem dragged.,/review/rw8575114/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2022,lovemichaeljordan,2," Why Tell Fictional Stories About a Real Person?
","Marilyn Monroe was a great artist and this movie could've been a great opportunity to teach younger audiences about who she was. But for some reason, they decide to tell a fictional story. She has the same name, plays in the same movies, and sings the same songs, but many events are made up. It's so misleading when movies do this. It's not a movie about Marilyn Monroe, it's a movie about a mentally ill actress. Monroe was more than a mentally ill sex symbol. She was intelligent and a great artist - which doesn't come across in this movie.",/review/rw8575114/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,Alexander_Blanchett,8," Two Personalities in one Body
",I really liked it a lot. Andrew Dominik showed us the dark side of Marilyn Monroe simply becuase nobody dared to do this before and there was (for sure) a dark side of her. I liked how he portrayed Monroe as two differnt characters that try to allign with each other. Ana de Armas perfeclty portrayed this rollercoaster of emotions. Showed us a pitch perfect - by the standards - Marilyn and her alter ego Norma Jean perfectly in ambiance. She truly gave one of the best performances I have seen all year and hopefully will get the deserved attnetion coming awards season for it.,/review/rw8575114/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,ghatbkk,7," Heartbreaking
","I have no idea how accurate this account of Marilyn Monroe's life is. I will say that there are some people in Norma Jean's life that, if this account is even close to accurate, are hopefully rotting in hell. This movie portrays a woman desperately in need of help who is tormented by many of the people that she chose to trust. A lot of ""heroes"" don't come out of this looking too good. Norma Jean comes out as a woman with massive insecurities and likely mental illness, who is abused and manipulated by many, many people, some of which claimed to love her, others of which simply wanted to make money off her,.",/review/rw8575114/?ref_=tt_urv

","Three hours of sheer boredom with the whole focus of the film being on Norma Jean's father who abandoned her mother before she was born. Nothing new on offer.

28 September 2022,tkdlifemagazine,7," A Unique and Visually Riveting Biopic
","I am not a Marilyn Monroe junkie, nor do I know that much about her life and career. I also was concerned that this movie is 3 hours long. This is a an Andrew Dominik film, based on a best selling book of the same title. The film is unusual and brilliantly done. It is a stream of consciousness that plays out more like a dream than a movie. It is visually stunning. The look and the details of this movie are stunning and breathtaking at parts. Ana de Armas is so unmistakeable as Marilyn Monroe that it is eerie. The effects working her into the actual Monroe films are seamless. The supporting case of actors are wonderful. This is a heavy dark movie in so many ways. It is a biography, but it is also the struggle of Norma Jean to distinguish herself from Marilyn Monroe, the character. It is also and ode to love, and to finding peace and identity through love. This movie is unique and brilliant, but it is not for someone looking for an easily digestible, chronological telling of the life of Marilyn Monroe. Much was made of the NC-17 rating; however, these scenes feed the story, not exploit it in my opinion. Netflix was bold in supporting this great project.",/review/rw8575114/?ref_=tt_urv

","As usual Hollyweird goes overboard and destroys another icon. Instead of telling us about both the bitter and the sweet - they settle on the bad. All the bad, ugly, dark and crazy, that's what they like to show us. No... they want to ram it down the viewers throat, again, and again, and again, and again. You think I'm being repetitive?

","This was so difficult to get through. It felt so messy and everything was one tone the entire way through, it was disaster after disaster with no room to breathe. I feel like even though this was a long film it didn't show who Monroe actually was, it focused on everything bad which I see what they were trying to do and what led her to taking her life but it was too much. There is also very sexual (sexual assault) scenes and they are so uncomfortable and unnecessary and felt a little disrespectful to show especially for that long! A lot of unnecessary nudity to be honest and abortion scenes which were too long and showed way too much and this happened 2/3 times it was horrific. This movie had these problems the entire way through and it was 3 hours! It was way too long for what we got, not worth the watch at all.",/review/rw8575114/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,EUyeshima,8," Ana de Armas Uncannily Channels Marilyn in an Overlong Movie Infused with Relentless Pain
","Look at her eyes. Look at the spot-on reenactments of her classic movie moments (especially ""Some Like It Hot""). Ana de Armas' transformation into Marilyn Monroe is devastating, heartbreaking, and so completely accurate that it comes across less as an imitation and more like an inhabitation of the legendary actress' soul. Lugubriously directed by Andrew Dominik, this overlong 2022 film is not a straight-up biopic but an episodic cautionary tale of pre-Harvey Weinstein abuse and power politics taken from a startling first-person perspective. Based on Joyce Carol Oates' 2001 novel, the story is not only tragic but painful to watch with trauma erupting in almost every scene. Look past de Armas' Oscar-worthy work if you can, and you'll see strong work from Julianne Nicholson as her disturbed mother and Adrien Brody as the Arthur Miller character. Why it received an NC-17 rating became clear toward the end.",/review/rw8575114/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2022,DavidsGuy,," So many cheap imitations
","First off, if I wanted to listen to someone impersonating MM with a Spanish accent, I'd go to a drag show in Tijuana. Secondly, this film (or whatever it's suppose to be) does a great disservice to MM to the point where I couldn't finish watching. Yes, I know it's FICTITIOUS and it's based on a FICTITIOUS book (which I read) but what's the point? It's simply one more grossly exploitive assault on her life and death and a badly done one at that. There are much better films about MM's life (15 others to be exact) and they don't scrape the bottom of the barrel to generate revenue and controversy. I'd recommend watching one of those instead. And always remember what Marilyn once sang: ""every baby needs a da-da-daddy..."" I know feminists won't like reading that, but it's true. Just make sure he's a nice daddy who will bounce you on his knee and not abuse and exploit you like this trashy, depressing, disrespectful mess does to MM. All involved should be ashamed and embarrassed.",/review/rw8575114/?ref_=tt_urv

29 September 2022,catebaum,8," It's a horror movie not a biopic
","People who wanted a Marilyn biopic turn away. It's not that. The book on which the film is based is a creepy slink through the darkness of Hollywood and the machine of goddess creation. Those who think Marilyn Monroe was a good girl are naive and uninformed. She was a real woman with needs and addictions who lived pretty wildly for most of her life. The scenes with the talking fetus are not for me, and seem rather by rote and pro-life, representing a full baby when it would have been a few cells at the point of her abortions. Also cloying is the suggestion she was obsessed with finding her father, which was overplayed here.",/review/rw8575114/?ref_=tt_urv

","Marilyn Monroe was exploited in life, and she's being mega-exploited in death. Blonde is pure unadulterated exploitation of a woman who simply should be left alone to rest in peace. I don't care what Ana De Armas or that bloviating director tries to say about this film or the multitude of excuses they use...it's trash. The entire film is a lesson in exploitation 101. De Armas is not at all convincing as Monroe and the utterly despicable scenes in Blond would make Attila the Hun cringe and look away. There's nothing more to say except...I hope this disrespectful piece of dreck is the last time someone tries to make money on Marilyn Monroe by constantly exploiting her and dragging her out of her grave just because they can.
