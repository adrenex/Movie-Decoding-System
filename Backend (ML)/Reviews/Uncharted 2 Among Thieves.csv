",I was looking forward to this and was cheering for it to work. Wow. Talk about a disappointment. (Note the 4 stars.),/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,afijamesy2k,4," night court should have been case dismissed
","Now i love the original 1984-92 night court, it was funny, hilarious and had a lot of style, this one however despite the comeback of john larroquette is truly banal and all over the map, melissa raunch who was hilarious in the big bang theory is wasted here is abby stone, the daughter of judge harry t stone and the rest of the cast is lost too, there's no brent spiner, no marsha warfield, no richard moll, none of that, the teleplay is real boring, the dialogue is ridiculous and what is a laugh track doing in this predicable mess, i know there a few good moments here and there, but this is just a bore, this is a very poor and boring intimidation of the original, rent the original night court instead.",/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,toncincin,3," Has potential ... BUT -
",Lose the laugh track! You insult our intelligence telling us WHEN to laugh and WHAT to laugh at. If the show is funny - we watchers know WHEN to laugh. Do it in front of a live audience if you want to include laughter or applause.,/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,david-thor,," Not ready for prime time
","What a dud. They should have made John Larroquette the judge; I keep thinking that the rest of The Big Bang Theory cast will go bad and end up in court. For one, Rauch - cute and potentially a lot funnier if only she had better material - looks like a friendly dwarf compared with the towering Larroquette, and the supporting cast doesn't have a bunch of standout goofballs like the original. The show's just getting started and may turn out just fine if the writing improves and the cast gels, but as of right now, it's a hollow shell of its predecessor. A few comments have mentioned how annoying the laugh track is, but I don't see how the show can function without it until it actually becomes worth laughing at. One of my favorite shows from the 60's, 'Green Acres', was pretty straight-laced until it morphed into a brilliant satire of rural life; here's hoping that this reboot has the same future.",/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,and_shove_it_up_your_butt,4," I want to like this, I really do.
","Thank God for John Laroquette. If not for him I wouldn't have bothered watching this reboot at all. By the way, who asked for this reboot? NOBODY.",/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,jp7570,3," A pale imitation of the original
","As a long-time fan of the original Night Court, like many others I was skeptical that a re-boot could capture the magic and heart of the original. Sadly, I was right, so what is wrong with the new version?",/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,VetteRanger,4," One star for each episode so far
","Most people reviewing here seem to be honest fans of the original show, and it was indeed funny .... every episode. Harry was a treat, and the surrounding cast played off of his humor very well, and he off of theirs.",/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,fabscott-18338,3," Canned laughter very annoying!
","This show has the potential, and the cast, that could work into successful series. BUT the very fake canned laughter absolutely ruins the show and makes it hard to watch. The producers should have faith in the cast to make it a show to watch. Too bad. Also, I'm not sure having the judge be the daughter of the previous judge is helpful in any way.",/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,wylfyr,1," not as good
","I had high hopes for this show and I really wanted to like this show, but after watching the first three episodes of this show, its just ISNT funny nor is it entertaining. Its Boring...there's no humor in the show except for the laugh track. The original series had a lot of great humor in it as well as great gags...like when Harry Stone criticizes Wile E Coyote for trying to catch/eat The Roadrunner.",/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,mhorg2018,1," Hollywood just doens't learn that Reboots should be canned...
","Honestly. Reboots should be canned before they even get approved. They don't work, are for the lazy and this is one of the worst. I barely got through the first episode and deleted it from my DVR. Trying to slip in Melissa Rauch, who looks WAY too young to be any kind of Judge, and who's delivery, along with the rest of the cast, is stilted, is silly. Harry had no kids. A cheap move on NBC's part. How about an original idea here? No. Why not take a show that failed and try to remake it into a success? Too hard, eh? As for the rest of the boring, forgettable cast, even Laroquette seems to be sleepwalking through this unfunny mess. How much cash did NBC pass around to get this show the good reviews it got? Just another gigantic miss.",/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,castlegirl09,7," Giving It a Chance
","The original Night Court went through 2 public defenders, 3 bailiffs, and 2 court clerks before the found the perfect mesh with their cast, so hopefully that can be the case with this iteration. Abby, Dan, and Olivia are fine. Neil could use some work, but Grug just doesn't work. It makes me thing that when Bull declined to come back, they scurried to figure out how to combine two bailiffs into one. Grug ends up being a Great Value Roz with Bull's childish mindset and it makes it seem like Lacretta can't act. (Also, why is Abby dressed like it's 2013?!)",/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,Sylviastel,7," We Need More Sitcoms! It's an Endangered Species
","I love sitcoms. Night Court was a staple in the eighties. Melissa Rauch played Judge Abby Stone, the daughter of the late Judge Harry Stone. She recruits a reluctant Dan Fielding as public defender. He was a prosecutor for years. There are a few kinks to work out with the other cast members. Dan is widowed and somewhat retired when she gets him to join the night court gang. I can see a great relationship between Dan and Abby. I would love to see others from the original series too. The first two episodes had done okay with a few laughs. I hope it lasts long. We need more sitcoms today. We need to laugh more. Too bad, Harry Anderson, Markie Post and Charlie Robinson aren't around.",/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,mj887,1," Canned laughter
","The canned laughter is so loud and annoying I couldn't watch it. Half the time, I couldn't even tell you what was said before the loud fake laughter overtook it.",/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,HelloBlockbuster,5," It needs...
",... Richard Moll and Marsha Warfield. BOTH OF THEM.,/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,wrogersmoody,2," Who thought this was a good idea?
","It's every bit as bad as anyone familiar with the original would suspect and fear. The original played off the late Harry Anderson with the tension and the interplay between John Larroquette and the late Markie Post. Richard Moll, the late Charles Robinson, and Marsha Warfield rounded out a solid ensemble cast that provided lighthearted usually ""silly"" humor umpretentiously.",/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,johnschubert-93854,3," Another remake
",This is a failed remake of a once brilliant series which unfortunately occurs far too often (see That 90's Show). Melissa Rauch is a talented actor and John Larroquette has been a quality actor for many years. It's not the acting that has failed this new series but the lame scripts and the direction to overact in order to accentuate the humor that isn't really funny. After watching the first 3 episodes this appears to be one of those programs introduced during the hiatus of other series to be forgotten as merely another filler in an off season. Resurrecting the past often is not successful and should not be attempted.,/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2023,steveknightvoice,3," The vibe is gone..
","Given the track record of ""rebooted"" classic sitcoms, I really didn't have high hopes for the ""Night Court"", but somehow, I was still disappointed. ""Night Court"" makes wrong turns at just about every level; The original blended dry humor with slapstick. The new version comes off as silly & forced. Melissa Rauch makes a valiant effort playing the daughter of Judge Harry Stone, but she lacks the comic timing & charm of Harry Anderson. John Larroquette returns as a kinder, gentler Dan Fielding, but as a defense attorney this time, it takes an arrow out of his quiver. Gone are the snarky comments about defendants, which is part of what gave the original the ""vibe"" that doesn't exist here.",/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2023,jpapanone,1," I had extremely low expectations...
",And this is even worse than I thought.,/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,sxct,2," Guilty as charged
","I am not going to change my rating but I do want to make an addition. When are they going to get rid of that insipid laugh track? I don't need something to tell me it's time to laugh because it usually isn't. In 1985 this show was really good, for the time period. Forty years later it doesn't work. The pigeon bit was ridiculous, and the wall painting made no sense.",/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,kevinwatt-home,1," Garbage
","Badly cast. Badly written. Horrible acting. There is noting redeemable here. All the charm and humour of the origianl are absent and you are left with a sad attempt at comedy. And even John Laroquette, who was the keystone character of the original, cannot carry the weight of this mess on his shoulders. He is just lipstick on a pig. And one of the worst things to learn is that Fryman directed this. She is a talented having directed the How I Met Your Mother series but clearly forgot how to make comedy gold. If this nightmare doesn't get cancelled I fear we will get more reboots of 80s and 90s shows like That 70s Show...oops, already did that.",/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,craigbenting,7," Many Flaws, But Well Worth Watching All Episodes
","I'm a big fan of the original series, mostly during the 80's, so when I heard they were doing this, I was 110% on-board.",/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,jacobstaggs,4," I See A Lot of Potential
","So Far, I have only seen the first two episodes but there is a lot of potential. Will it be squandered? I don't know. You have a great laugh track and some great character moments. On the flip side, it's too plot heavy even for the first two episodes of a series. Couldn't it have just started with a case where Dan Fielding is ALREADY the defense and approaches the bench and says, ""I don't know how you talked me into this. I know your Harry's daughter and all"" etc. The pilot is pointless save for the examination into Neil's character, played brilliantly by Kapil Talwalkar.",/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2023,ddio-26092,2," If this was the original....
",It would have been canceled. Sorry. Take the remake out of context with the original and it's rubbish.,/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,stevekweiss,2," No humor
","Never mind that I'm a huge fan of the original. The only thing this has in common with the original is the location. While John Larroquette plays a character named Dan Fielding, any resemblance to the original is coincidental.",/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,gcstubbs-31461,1," Nice to see Laroquette on tv again. Sad it's such a poor show
","I liked Rauch very much on Big Bang but this ""show"" is beneath her. The rest of the cast just ain't there. Their performances wouldn't land them a part in community theatre. The best joke this show had to offer was including this ""show"" as something resembling an NBC Original when this show is a reboot of of a once popular show that lasted two seasons longer than it should have. This ""show"" just NBC way of reminding its audience that if you want a quality show you're going to have to pay for it. So until you're ready to pay for it you're out of luck. If the medium is the message then the message is give us your money! (Insert laugh track here.) Next thing you know Fox will bring back Ally McBeal in a mash up series with Boston Legal that is set in psycho ward and the only returning 'star' of either show is Shirley Schmidtho playing a Nurse Ratched type character. Yes indeedy the nuts are running the nut house in this uproarious new comedy where every character has the same tag line: ""Sorry! Mad Cow!""",/review/rw8808352/?ref_=tt_urv
