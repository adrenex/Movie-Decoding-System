14 September 2019,Calicodreamin,7," Surprisingly good
","I went into this with an open mind, I didn't know what it was about. But I was pleasantly surprised. The acting is good, the plot is straightforward, and the action is well done. The cinematography and make-up are really well done. I quite enjoyed the pairing of Smith and Edgerton. Really well done.",/review/rw4025730/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2017,claudio_carvalho,7," Looks Like a Pilot of a TV Series
","In Los Angeles, humans live with orcs and elves in a world where fantasy creatures do exist. LAPD police officer Dayl Ward (Will Smith) is the first human cop having the orc police officer Nick Jakoby (Joel Edgerton) as partner. When Ward is shot by an orc and Jakoby does not capture the shooter, he questions whether Jakoby lets the fellow orc escape. During a patrol, Ward and Jakoby arrest a man that tells that there is a prophecy and Ward is blessed. Meanwhile, Internal Affairs press Ward to find the truth about the escape of the shooter so that they can fire Jakoby. The magic department of the FBI interrogates the man that belongs to the terrorist Shield of Light group and they learn that they are preparing the return of the Dark Lord that will destroy the world. Ward and Jakoby are summoned to attend a disturbance and they stumble upon a Shield of Light safehouse where they arrest the elf Tikka (Lucy Fry) and her magic wand. Soon they learn that Tikka is hunted down by the evil and powerful elf Leilah (Noomi Rapace) and her gang and they need to protect Tikka and the wand; otherwise the world will be destroyed. What will they do?",/review/rw4025730/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2021,brentn,7," Strange and awesome.
","Otherworldly and full of action which is why Will Smith took the part. Joel Edgerton is barely recognizable and the story is sort of predictable but it doesn't take away from the presentation. This is Street Kings for Will Smith. Noomi was a cool villain even though there is more than one. The gentrification was a nice touch since there is magic and sorcery involved it makes sense that there would be different classes of people/species and that it would be very prevalent. The action was relentless and bloody and Smith was a little more level headed and not as over the top as he is in Bad Boys or MIB. It seemed darker than his usual movies which is a good move on his part. Overall I enjoyed this and since a sequel has been announced, I guess I wasn't the only one. Solid action movie and recommend.",/review/rw4025730/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," I liked the new story line!
",To everyone who had not seen this show yet you don't know what you have missed!!!! This review is for everyone who has already seen this movie!!! If you have already watched this movie on Netflix you have to watch it again!!! It is totally different!!! Well same movie but they have changed all kinds of scenes!!!! All the little side dialogue scenes have completely different dialogue from the regional showing of this movie on Netflix !!! It's like a completely alternate telling of the same story but with more detail of the telling of the story ! If you've watched this movie already watch it again!!! It's like watching it for the first time they made it totally redone and more enjoyable and completely open to a sequel! I would be truly disappointed if there is never a sequel to the show !!!!!,/review/rw4025730/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2017,view_and_review,6," Underdeveloped
","In a present day world of orcs, fairies, elves and humans a new form of bigotry exists in which orcs are the object of all kinds of discrimination while elves enjoy exclusivity--as in they have all the exclusive stuff. I wouldn't call it racism towards the orcs because that would imply that orcs are a race when in fact they are an entirely different species (I doubt a human and and orc can procreated together (ugh!)). In any case, Officer Daryl Ward (Will Smith) is the unfortunate recipient of an orc partner, Nick Jakoby (Joel Edgerton), on a force in which no other orcs exist nor are they welcome. The two of them have to work together to overcome the bitterness between each other as well as the vitriol that comes from others on the force. They also have to figure out how to protect the world from a dangerous magic wand.",/review/rw4025730/?ref_=tt_urv

22 December 2017,boggie4758,8," Was so much better than I thought it would be
",I twist on buddy cop movie. Will Smith and the Orc play off each other perfectly. I could see this is how it would be if Middle Earth got pushed into our present day. The acting is good and the make up is excellent. Ok I loved the Orc and laughed at his one liners..If you want to watch something different then this is the movie for you. I liked it a lot.,/review/rw4025730/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2019,nancyldraper,6," Lost potential
",Lots of potential but the execution just got out of control. The dialogue could have been a lot more crisp but instead it was diluted by letting the characters riff out. The mood was uneven not able to balance wise cracks and action. It had the big budget bang but this could have been so much better with more incisive writing and mor streamlined direction. I give this film a 6 (fair) out of 10. {Fantasy Action},/review/rw4025730/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2018,kevinoneil-99062,10," Hollywood hates Netflix
","This is a horribly interesting thing.
I found Bright to be pretty damn enjoyable. It's a kind of run all night movie where the characters go against everyone and rightfully so with how the movie sets up the stage and the world it is set in.
I find this movie deserves a 8/10 but will give a 10/10 because of the weird hate revolving around it.
What was bad?
The acting was great. The story was great. The characters great. Also being able to make a world with different rules and make the characters so relateable was amazing.
The stage the music the mostly everything was great about this film.
So how was it so bad?
There is a very strange hate for this film and we should all take notice that Netflix is doing something to piss Hollywood off. 
Maybe making original stories and not another Jason Bourne/Transformers/Pos movie is what makes critics angry these days.
29 from Metacritic? There is more to the story here.",/review/rw4025730/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2018,cherold,7," Never as good as its brilliant title sequence but generally fun
","Bright has an amazing title sequence, using graffiti and posters to sketch out a contemporary Los Angeles where fairies and elves are real and Orcs are an oppressed race dealing with humans who fear and hate them. It's a densely packed sequence that promises something really cool.",/review/rw4025730/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2017,lunalovitt,3," I was hoping for more...
","I had such high hopes for this movie, but at the end of the day my hopes were too high. I loved the idea of it all, but when I actually sat down to watch it I found myself wanting to stop less than half way through because it was just... boring. I feel like a lot of the culture and world could have been built up and better explained. It doesn't have to be spoon fed to the audience, but really... It would have been nice to have some lore other than some spray tags in the opening credits. I think the hints of the world created by the writers was incredibly fascinating, but all of it was wasted.",/review/rw4025730/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2017,Leofwine_draca,6," Cop thriller with a twist
","BRIGHT is another cop thriller from the hit-or-miss director David Ayer, and yet another spin on his ever-popular END OF WATCH. This takes the concept of the patrolling cop duo and mixes it with some LORD OF THE RINGS-style fantasy in which orcs and elves live in the real world and mix with the humans of the cast. There are elements of ENEMY MINE and DISTRICT 9 in the story of Will Smith's and his orc partner Joel Edgerton's attempts to save an elf girl and her magic wand from coming into the possession of a vengeful dark elf killer. I really can't stand some of Ayer's movies - END OF WATCH being one of them - but others, like SABOTAGE and FURY, I've really enjoyed. BRIGHT falls somewhere between the two camps in terms of quality. It's predictable but watchable, familiar but engaging at the same time. An ageless Will Smith has more natural charisma than I remember, while Edgerton does well hidden in the orc suit. Other seasoned performers like Noomi Rapace and Edgar Ramirez don't disappoint. As ever, the action sequences are the highlight here, with Ayer adept at delivering blistering thrills so that the viewer's attention is held from beginning to end.",/review/rw4025730/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2021,pinobarbaritano-44840,7," Would have been better as a show
",I love the world building and the setting of this movie... the only thing that comes to my mind thats similar is Onward which was released 3 years later by Disney. To explore this world with a series would've been much more exciting... sadly the run time isn't enough for this and the weak story doesn't help with that... GREAT concept but wrong execution :/,/review/rw4025730/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2017,siderite,7," Not a normal body cop movie? It's exactly that.
","OK, it's got orcs and magic and elves and even mentions of dwarfs, but it's a simple cop movie. It features obvious foreshadowing, typical cardboard villains that are terrifying and effective only when not engaging our heroes who, by in some way or another, are regular folks, like me, and you, and Harry Potter. Only brave. Yet it was also a fun movie. The effects were OK, the world building was subtle enough to leave a lot of room for exploring and the acting was mostly good. And the plot feels so familiar as is similar to so many other movies like, say, Alien Nation. Wait... It's exactly like Alien Nation. And, alas, just like that movie is a cult film for just a few and some have never heard of it, so will it happen with Bright. At least that one spawned a TV series, which is the best possible outcome for this film. Too bad, since with a little bit of creative effort, it could have been both appealing to the masses and having something intelligent and inspiring in the background.",/review/rw4025730/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2018,gabriel_sanchez,5," It's alright.

26 December 2017,zardoz-13,8," ""Bright"" Is Radiant
","Clearly, Netflix wants to go toe-to-toe with Hollywood, and they are challenging it with their own provocative, slam-bang, $90-million, pulp-fantasy-thriller ""Bright,"" toplining Will Smith and Joel Edgerton as a rare pair of LAPD beat cops. Although Smith plays a human, Edgerton is cast as an Orc! Essentially, ""Suicide Squad"" director David Ayer has taken his superb police procedural ""End of Watch"" (2012) and retooled it as something like director Graham Baker's ""Alien Nation"" (1988) with the fantastic beings from Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" franchise. Clocking in close two hours, ""Bright"" conjures up non-stop action, nail-gnawing suspense, unbearable tension, complete with surprises and revelations galore. Smith is as charismatic as ever, but he isn't mimicking his ""Bad Boys"" character Mike Lowery, a role that he plans to reprise in two forthcoming sequels: ""Bad Boys Forever"" and ""Bad Boys 4."" As veteran patrolman Daryl Ward, he is mired up to his neck in devastating debt, and his chief aim in life is to survive long enough to get his pension. Meantime, Ward finds himself in a predicament like nothing any policeman has confronted. The world of ""Bright"" is as gritty, violent, and racially charged as 21st century America, but this imaginative epic takes place in an alternate universe where far-fetched creatures, such as Orcs, Fairies, Elves, and others have been co-existing with humans since the dawn of time. Were it not for these extraordinary characters, ""Bright"" would amount to little more than another foray in urban crime. Sadly, this inventive hokum suffers from two shortcomings. First, predictable plotting undermines the outcome because Ayer and ""Victor Frankenstein"" scenarist Max Landis paint themselves into a corner. Second, the filmmakers provide only the most basic backstory about this bizarre new world. Meantime, the original ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" actress Noomi Rapace keeps things exciting as a demonic elf who tries to ice our heroes, while Edgar Ramirez is equally as tenacious as another kind of Elf with a badge.

28 April 2020,JoeytheBrit,," Bright review
","Netflix's first attempt to muscle in on the major studios' blockbuster domain was always going to meet with contempt and ridicule from those syndicated critics who rely upon the studios for their sustenance, so the streaming service didn't really help themselves by kicking off with such a bizarre entry. Part cop-buddy movie, part alternative reality/fantasy, Bright gets bogged down in its misguided attempt to make a simple scenario appear complex and simply doesn't know when to call it a day. Smith is as reliable as expected in the kind of role he can play in his sleep, and the film is nowhere as bad as those critics would have you believe - it just isn't particularly good.",/review/rw4025730/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2021,cjonesas,7," [7.1] The Wand is Bright..
