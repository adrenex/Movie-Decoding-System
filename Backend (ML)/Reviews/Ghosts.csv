14 March 2019,feliciaa-08320,1," I used to like this show
","I really liked the first season, the second we're okay but the third I don't even recognize the series I once used to like.",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2019,tzuuuUUUU,1," First season good, second questionable, third season a 1/10
","While first season was cheesy it still had an interesting story to follow, it was a great watch all in all for what it was 7.5/10. In the second season they started to run out of ideas and it was just ""okay"", I would rate it 5.5/10. The third season though.. oh my god. It might be one of the worst things ever made in human history. The writing is SO BAD, like its written by a 10 year old kid, everyone's acting is awful, like ten times worse than the first and second season. Nothing makes sense, no weight to anything.. everything is just awful. I would seriously give season 3 a 1 out of 10 and I am not kidding. A goddamn 1/10. Horrible.",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2019,Ahmadkkotb,3," 100 m/h going downhill
","What started as a strong teen drama with thrilling mysteries and good twists and hit season two with a good plot, by season three totally lost it's charm, it no longer has any logic or reason begind it, simply a bunch of teens walking around acting like they're adults and adults letting a bunch of kids run the town in the most ridiculous ways to the point it's no longer in connection with reality",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,pawanpunjabithewriter,6," How is it still surviving?
","Season one was terrific. I honestly rated 8/10. Season two got better and bigger with greater character arcs, suspense and crime-drama. Betty is wonderful. Jughead and FP make a great team. As per me, Season two gets an 8.5.",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2021,MichalMizrachi,6," WHAT IS WITH THE SINGING?!
","Season 1 was great, the actors, the script, the storyline.",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2022,keonir,1," ????????????
","Literally what the hell is this show & how had it been renewed for so many seasons with how absurd the writing is. The writers must've been taking the ""good stuff"" in their room and just wrote whatever nonsense came out of their heads during their bender.",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2021,ethanjjacobs,2," Getting worse and worse
","Season 1 6.5/10
Is a promising start to the show , a negative is that it can have very cringy scenes but is a decent season overall and ends on a great cliffhanger",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2021,ginahiza,1," Unsatisfactory
","I can't stand the script, the storyline doesn't even make sense. Why is it a musical all of a sudden? What the hell is the director doing?",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2021,usuyami_13,1," How is this still getting renewed?
","It all went downhill after season 1, up to this point I can't understand why is this still getting renewed, specially when so many good shows get cancelled.",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,7," It's enjoyable fluff.
","I'm stunned by just how many episodes they've managed to churn out, talk about over egging the pudding. The characters transform inexplicably from week to week, and everything is so absurd, that 99% of it is impossible to comprehend. Yet there is something rather addictive about it, sure it's full of beautiful people, but there are some really interesting characters too, Cheryl in particular, great fun. They have recycled scenes from Carrie, Halloween, and just about every movie you can think of, but who cares, this is low brow, trashy, hugely enjoyable escapism. I would never repeat watch it, but I'll always sit down to a new series. 7/10",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2019,almabjellerup-53059,1," First season was good, the rest is not worth your time.
","Started out great interesting and intriguing. But not it's just simply the worst. One of the worst shows I've seen. Too bad, really liked the first season.",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2019,PsychoBeard666,3," Eurgh!
",I know I'm not the target audience but I at least expected some coherent writing or interesting plot points. Every episode is the same: nothing happens until the last 10 seconds which drops a bombshell to make you feel the need to keep watching.,/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,wandernn1-81-683274,2," Riverdale, The Community Run by 30 year old High School Students.
","I made it to Season 2 Ep. 12 before deciding, wow this show is just SO STUPID. I mean high school kids are running their parents, and running the town. Got sick of seeing Veronica tell her parents what's up. Got really sick of Archie who is supposedly the GOOD GUY WHO LOVES HIS DAD, not telling his DAD that he's spying on HIS DAD FOR THE FBI!!! LOL .... SO DUMB.",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2017,koffeekupkriminalk,2," RiverFail
","Yet another CW show about 30-something teens where every conversation is a confrontation, where every character is so enamored of their ""mad skills"" and implied superiority it now transcends pathetic and is just plain boring, where the portrayal of under-aged drinking, promiscuous sex, and statutory rape is just standard operating procedure, where adults are so explicitly simple-minded, unaware, ignorant and un-involved it seems they were taken directly from a cell phone commercial, and where, apparently, millennial TV is devolving to at an alarming rate.",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2019,flynnwcarson,1," Do people still watch this
",I actually used to like the show the first season was good the second season was questionable but the third is a complete mess,/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2019,armanwhannell,3," CRINGE
",First season was good. The second season was OK. But after watching the third season I wonder whether this TV show should be nominated for the cringiest TV series ever. Who else agrees with me?,/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2021,arod_85,4," Goes from intriguing to stupidly comical
","This show started off strong. Season 1 was good, fairly believable and the show's stylistic shots were really neat. Reminded me of a modern Twin Peaks for younger adults. However, as the seasons progressed, the seasons gradually became worse up to the point I stopped watching. The show completely lost it's way and became overtop with storylines that were downright stupid. And stupid is an understatement. I'm not sure why tv shows make shows about characters that are supposed to be 15 and 16 but conduct their lives like they are 30. So a highschool student has a hand in organized crime, owns a Speak Easy, can solve murder mysteries involving cults and serial killers that police cannot, can go on the run without any respectable parent looking for them, escape prison and hide out in a bunker, expose an organ harvesting ring, lead a a biker gang and the list goes on. There were also so many moments I found myself laughing hysterically at something that was intended to be creepy or add shock value, like one of the teens keeping her dead brother's body hanging out around the house while she talks to his corpse like he is still alive but then shows up shooting bow and arrows in the forest. Completely random. Like this review, the show is a ranting mess. Maybe watch season 1 then quit while you are ahead...",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2022,f-abdolian-481-414571,2," Another ridiculous example of why some shows have to end after the first season!
",I had to watch it in desperation of not having anything else to watch.,/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2017,GomezAddams666,1," My God, did this suck
","I knew going dark on the Archie Comics would be a bad idea, I just didn't know it would suck this much.",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2020,brookenichole-98054,1," Oh boy
","This show is a complete mess! Every character has somehow completely went insane. I hate every single one of them. There's the same ridiculous plot lines. It's never end. They especially love to add random sex scenes. And the one couple I keep hoping for (that's not toxic) won't end up together. And I mean Betty and Archie. But, we just get the same old toxic couple pairings. I really want to skip the whole show and stop but, it's such a train wreck. How could I? I suggest start with season 1 and finish at season 2.",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2020,man-96513,1," Increasingly Absurd Writing - hard pass on the current season
",Let me preface this review by saying I am a big fan of Riverdale.,/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2017,atlasmb,8," Don't Look For Comics In Riverdale
","The Archie Comics that originated in the 1940s were rated ""G"" for Goofy. Maybe not as goofy as ""Scooby Doo"", but it was a wholesome (you might say ""square"") universe. A version of ""Archie"" was even in bubble gum wrappers for a couple of years.",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2019,cerenkarakas1997,4," First season is the only good season
","In the first season i was really into the show ,then I quit watching at the beginning of season 3.I think the first season is for everyone to watch but other seasons are meant for teens/high schoolers.",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2019,trimblecali,," Don't take it too seriously
","This show is a teen soap opera. It's meant to be a bit ridiculous. Some episodes/storylines are better than others, for sure. But it's over the top-ness is part of the genre. It's entertaining.",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2017,preppy-3,7," Not bad
","A dark live action adaptation of the Archie comic books. All the characters from the comic are here--Archie, Reggie, Jughead, Betty, Veronica, Cheryl Blossom, Kevin Kellar...but there are differences. Archie is pumped up and muscular in this one a far cry from the comic. Ms. Grundy is an old ugly teacher in the comic--here she's young and hot. Kellar has blond hair and blue eyes in the comic--here he was dark hair and eyes. Also it seems Moose here is gay or at least bisexual. There's also no humor in this one. It's DARK dealing with mostly murder and sex. It moves fairly quick, the cast is young, attractive and can act. Honestly I was never bored. Worth seeing.",/review/rw3627850/?ref_=tt_urv
