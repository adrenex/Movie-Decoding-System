14 January 2016,Sleepin_Dragon,8," No way should this work, but it does.
","I must admit to being highly sceptical by the whole premise surrounding Dickensian. Having studied several of the great works for English lit the thought of combining characters seemed like a grand scale disaster, but to my utter amazement, it's cohesive, logical and has become utterly addictive viewing. I find the scheduling a little all over the place, it seems to go out at random times, so I enjoy catching up with it at work having lunch.",/review/rw3419377/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2016,l_rawjalaurence,8," Thoroughly Enjoyable Serialization Inspired by Dickens's Novels
","Produced by Tony Jordan (who also wrote seven of the twenty episodes), formerly of EASTENDERS, DICKENSIAN could be superficially described as a nineteenth century transposition of the BBC's popular soap opera. The action takes place in an unspecified London street teeming with people - beggars, hawkers, sellers, pedestrians - and lined with shops. A pub (""The Three Cripples"") provides a focus for much of the action just like the Queen Vic in the soap. The protagonists originate from a variety of socio-economic backgrounds and interact with one another on cold winter days, where the snow mostly lies thick on the ground or falls lightly. The only thing missing from DICKENSIAN that would give it the authentic EASTENDERS touch is the familiar line of dialogue where one character wants to ""have a li'le talk (tawk)"" with another.",/review/rw3419377/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2016,Lejink,7," Plot the Dickens!
","The idea of bringing together into one narrative different fictional characters has been done recently and brilliantly in the likes of ""Penny Dreadful"" but this new BBC series takes it up a few notches more, not only in the number of disparate characters but of course that they are all from the world of Charles Dickens.",/review/rw3419377/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2019,jandriod2012,10," Even better second time around
","I watched this series when it was first televised and loved it then. I have since binge watched it, having been shown again over the Christmas period.
This is a wonderful show and concept, following the characters before their tales in Dickens novels take off. Everything about it was of the highest quality, brilliant acting, fabulous sets and the right amount of tension. I particularly loved Amelia Havisham's story and found it quite heartbreaking; Tuppence Middleton played the character brilliantly. I also enjoyed Honaria and Frances Barbary's tale as the backstory for Bleak House. What thrilled me was how the series ended, neatly rounding off each of the characters journey's to the point where the books start - Amelia in her wedding gown, and the distant rattle of chains as Scrooge sits in his living room... just wonderful. It has inspired me to read Dickens again; any show which gets people to read more is a great achievement in my opinion",/review/rw3419377/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2016,beresfordjd,8," Surprisingly good
","Given that I totally loathe Eastenders and its dreary premise, I was so surprised to find just how enjoyable Dickensian is. I recorded quite a few episodes but once I started watching I have fond it compulsive viewing. My only complaint is the casting of Stephen Rea as the detective, Bucket. Rea is not a great favourite of mine so I find it hard to be convinced by him. The other actors are, in my opinion, fantastically well cast. Pauline Collins is great as is Ned Dehenny as Scrooge. Everyone inhabits their parts very well. Production values are high and Victorian Britain is well portrayed here. The story is well written and plotted and makes a pleasant change from the dreadful Eastenders. It is interesting to see the show's take on Miss Havisham's fate which was never really fully explained in Great Expectations. I just hope that the standard remains as high as the series has been so far.",/review/rw3419377/?ref_=tt_urv

16 May 2017,robertemerald,7," London in the 1800s is brought to life amid a community of fruity characters
","Dickensian lost points for me because its all centered around the same general set, that is, a few streets of old London town. That was a problem for me. The actors are fabulous and, in small and considered doses, and an intelligent pace, a joy to watch, truly. The script is fine and didn't need to be deliberately a Charles Dickens  what  satire  tribute  soap? Which just brings my current 2017 viewpoint back to this irritating problem. This show just stays home all the time. I found it claustrophobic. I am used to 19th Century movie and television treats such as Sherlock Holmes, Penny Dreadful, Dracula, and such, all of which leap to the country (or at least out of any given neighborhood) from time to time. Although I can only give Dickensian 7 out of 10 myself, I think there will be a big place for this experiment in future revisions of the genre, and this show will be remembered fondly.",/review/rw3419377/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2021,Blumanowar,8," Thoroughly enjoyed it
","Kept me wanting more, numerous story arcs going throughout the 10 hours and all were brought to a close by the end... I started to give it a 7 because I didn't really like the way a couple of them ended, especially with Honoria, but decided I couldn't budge from an 8. Great cast across the board. Rea and Rundle were very good, but Middleton was fantastic. I saw her in Sense8 and realized what a terrific actress she was (much better than rest of cast) but this showed what incredible range she has when contrasting her two characters....this certainly showcased her beauty as well. Stunning. As English period pieces go this was another great one. The Brits just do them so much better.",/review/rw3419377/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you never heard of Charles Dickens or read any of his works, you would enjoy this program immensely. If you are familiar with the works of Dickens, it is nothing short of magnificent. As soon as a Dickens' character appeared, I felt like I was seeing an old friend that I haven't seen in years. I loved it!!",/review/rw3419377/?ref_=tt_urv

30 June 2019,canadiense,9," The spirit of Charles Dickens continues
",Well done BBC. I was hesitant at first because I was worried about the tampering of Charles Dickens amazing work and especially over a story that combines many of his characters from other books into a murder mystery. The dialogue was as if Dickens himself wrote it and I believe he would have enjoyed it as much as I did.,/review/rw3419377/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2016,eapplebaum,10," I love it.
","I found this series thoroughly engaging and well done. I found it exciting and riveting, especially because the story is based on, or the more accurate versions of Dickens stories and then combines them. I love it! I would LOVE to see a second series where we follow Scrooge through his journey with the Ghost of present, past and future! I MUST know what happens to Arthur! Will Amelia remain in her dining room forever like that? Will she ever forgive Arthur and take him back into her heart? What about Honoria!? Will she find out what Francis has done? Wll she be reunited with her lovely man and their living child? where do the lawyer take the child? And most of all, What will become of Oliver? Will he eventually find his true family? The little actor who plays him is SO SO SO adorable I wish I could adopt that little boy and shower him in love and care!!",/review/rw3419377/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2021,Lincsobserver,9," Engrossing celebration of the world of Dickens
","I've enjoyed re-watching Dickensian during lockdown, it could do with some editing in places, but overall it's an engrossing re-imagining of the back stories of many well known characters, from various novels, all co-existing at the same time, in the same London neighbourhood. The most powerful storylines are those of Miss Havisham and Lady Dedlock, two of Dickens' most formidable female characters, here seen when they are still vivacious young women, full of life and hope. The events that befall them give depth to their characters, and emphasise the tragic wasted potential of their lives. The scene in the final episode, when Nancy sings to an enthralled audience in the local pub, happily believing she is in love with Bill Sykes, is also poignant, knowing what fate has in store for her. Was there ever any thought of doing a second series? There was certainly the potential for one. Perhaps viewing figures were disappointing; devotees of Dickens might have seen it as sacrilege, and it may have been perceived as too highbrow by the average viewer. Nevertheless, I found it a triumph, that celebrates rather than just exploits, the works of the author.",/review/rw3419377/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2020,rujane,10," Would have loved to hear the elevator pitch on this one...
","As someone else headlined, this program should not work, but it does, and beautifully. Drawing characters from at least a half dozen Dickens works into a single universe, and shaping a very Dickensian Victorian social melodrama/murder mystery would seem to be a formidable undertaking, particularly when juggling so many separate narratives. First rate production values, excellent writing and superb performances (Stephen Rea's Bucket is just wonderful) made this one of the very few truly must-see series I've come across.
I could not figure out whether this was: A) intended to be a limited series, or B) only Season 1 of something that did not get renewed. There was a loose tying up of a few narratives, but if it was B, what a shame - so many possibilities for a continuation.",/review/rw3419377/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have just gotten around to watching Dickensian and it's brilliant. The acting, the sets and the whole idea is so original. I don't want it to finish. Any concerns I have are small. I've noticed or think I have anyway that there are light bulbs in some of the oil-lamps and there's no effort to hide them. I'm surprised at the BBC as they are excellent. Is there a reason that Little Nell is mixed race and the artful dodger too. Dickens never said what they were but I think it's always been that that they were typical kids from London?
