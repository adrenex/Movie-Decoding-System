4 January 2021,cgvsluis,7," Follow the clues
","I have three favorite mystery series on Hallmark's Movies and Mysteries Channel: Murder she Baked, Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, and Mystery 101. Murder She Baked used to be my favorite, thanks to the lack of recent entries and the continued entries of Aurora Teagarden (that and Candace Cameron Bure's star power along with her fellow cast members)...I think Aurora has now eclipsed Murder she Baked in to my favorite. I mention these, because Mystery 101 has been a slow burn that I am really enjoying and thanks to the on-screen chemistry between our two stars playing Travis and Amy may be working it's way to the top of my list.",/review/rw6880989/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2021,kbarker83,10," The Best of all the Hallmark Movies and Mysteries franchises
","As an mystery enthusiasts, I will watch every mystery series that Hallmark puts on but there are none that I look more forward to with anticipation than Mystery 101. Kristoffer Polaha and Jill Wagner have insane on screen chemistry that leaves you wanting to watch Travis and Amy over and over. The cases are fun as well as they give you enough clues to help you figure out who dunnit along with them and things that may seem little at the beginning turn out to be big in the end. Another thing I love is how things the characters do and say carry over from one episode to the next. The progression of Travis and Amy's relationship is very organic and realistic. Give this a try!",/review/rw6880989/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2021,Reddragon84,8," Another feature-length TV mystery series of movies from THE HALLMARK CHANNEL...
","Which is NO bad thing in my house - being an avid reader and viewer of fictional crime/whodunnit-type mysteries, I have thoroughly enjoyed most, if not all of the various TV mystery Film series from the aforementioned channel over the last 15 years or so. The most recent of such series include ""HAILEY DEAN MYSTERIES "" RUBY HERRING MYSTERIES"" and AURORA TEAGARDEN MYSTERIES.",/review/rw6880989/?ref_=tt_urv

","So what is with the ending on the latest episode. That sure came out of left field, and I hope that the next episode is out sooner than later. Any ideas?",/review/rw6880989/?ref_=tt_urv

17 April 2021,bandameek-24307,7," Clean, Well Arranged and Excellent Movie
","This movie is very clean and well articulated. No nudity, no violence, no stupid dialogues, no cursing, no sex, no drugs and above all well arranged.",/review/rw6880989/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2022,michel-05066,10," Excellent Mystery
",Best series of Movies I've seen on Hallmark. Mystery 101 franchise pairs two leading actors who have the best chemistry and rapport. Its a much more adult like movie and the writer puts them in the most interesting situations. In addition to attempting to solve the mystery yourself as you watch you can see the awesome slow build of a bit of flirtation happening with the lead characters that leaves you waiting impatiently for the next movie to come out! Bravo Hallmark. Love Kris and Jill! (and Graham too).,/review/rw6880989/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2022,mamad9394,8," One of my favorite of the Hallmark Murder & Mystery series.
",I enjoy several of Hallmark's M&M's series including Mystery 101. These are written with interesting dialog and characters that have developed with each episode. I have enjoyed watching Amy & Travis's relationship grow and I like how it is a mature respectful one. Their characters seem to truly enjoy each other's opinions and have an almost geedy fascination with each other. I liked how at the end of the movie the finally got around to admitting how they felt about each other but then the end wasn't the end and all the sudden Amy has a fiance and it's not Travis WTH is up with that and more importantly when is the next movie coming out so you can explain what kind of BS you thought you were going to pull.,/review/rw6880989/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2021,hypzrkunt,5," More thoughts on what use to be a fun show
",I have lowered my rating to 5 because the ending kills all good will that the show has built up. I won't watch these episodes anymore and I have watched them at least 4 or 5 times each.,/review/rw6880989/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,memine23,4," what did i miss
",I love jill Wagners work but this is a dud - not on her part but as a project a yawn of no small effort - no chemistry between main protagonists and mysteries just plain silly - i tried to watch but ended up fast forwarding through most all episodes because of useless filler.....and nonsense dialogue - but i can say the scenery and back drop Quest university is just gorgeous... trying to compose a negative review in 600 words is a stretch - this was just not great - 4 stars is mean but i would not recommend this for a time waster to anyone. I don't understand how many of these Hallmarks get made - or continued - some are B works at best some are home runs....,/review/rw6880989/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2022,feck-58942,1," Painfully bad
","A mystery show as flat as, well, a Hallmark greeting card. The crime happens in a world, where only beautiful but brainless people live who say insignificant things to each other. The script shows no imagination. The characters are exchangable. Everybody has perfect hair. Everybody has a perfect body. Everybody wears designer clothes.",/review/rw6880989/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2021,roccof13-848-639431,1," Unwatchable
",So poorly written (implausible) and terribly acted. It appears that the actors don't believe what they're saying - they show little commitment and are almost hesitant to deliver the lines.,/review/rw6880989/?ref_=tt_urv
