7 March 2005,Wulfstan10,10," Hard to Beat
","This version of Pride and Prejudice is simply outstanding and excels in essentially every aspect. It is faithful to the book, particularly capturing the spirit of the book and the energy and constant tension of the story. It excellently portrays the world of the book as it relates to the story, with keen attention to the details of costume, the furniture, etc. Moreover, the actors were on the whole outstanding. I fail to see how anyone could have portray Darcy better than did Colin Firth, who perfectly captured the character's aristocratic refinedness, his shyness and sense of decorum that come across as apparent stuffiness and disdain, and his underlying passion, all at the same time. He perfectly blends all these different traits and is utterly convincing in portraying the outward stiffness as a simple facade for the strong emotions and character underneath, rather than simply being stiff and wooden. His looks, and especially his eyes, say so much of the complexity of his character and his feelings with subtle expressions. Similarly Jennifer Ehle excellently portrays Lizzie, showing her to be tender, witty, thoughtful, occasionally prone to strong judgments without all the information, yet trying to grapple with different feelings as her involvement with Darcy, et al., progresses. David Bamber is great as Mr. Collins and perfectly conveys his mix of traits. Alison Steadman's histrionics and fickle opinions are wonderful as the mom, and remind me very much of an actual relative of mine, while Benjamin Whitrow is a great counterpart as the father who is outwardly usually calm and peaceful, yet always able to rile up his wife. The others are great, too, but there is no point in listing them all. The bottom line is that I find it hard to beat this production, which is utterly gripping and keeps anyone interested in these stories completely entranced the whole way through.",/review/rw0353942/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 1999,Rosabel,10," Perfect book, perfect film
","A female journalist once wrote that no actress could ever portray Elizabeth Bennet to the satisfaction of a woman viewer for one very simple reason: every woman really visualizes herself in that role.  Jennifer Ehle has done the impossible - she is, and in my mind, forever will be, Elizabeth.  The beauty, wit, and sparkling liveliness of the character are perfectly captured in her performance.  And Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy is an exact match for her.  His smoldering good looks are wonderful, and he can portray reserve without descending into woodenness and blankness.  The scene where he and Elizabeth dance a long and stately dance together in the midst of a crowd is both controlled and exciting - with very little change of tone, and while preserving the most correct decorum, their conversation reveals dangerous undercurrents of emotion, and meanwhile the steps of the dance keep pulling them together and apart again. The rest of the characters are equally fine - David Bamber's obsequious Mr. Collins is especially unforgettable.",/review/rw0353942/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2009,pekinman,10," A great adaptation of Jane Austen
",This version of 'Pride and Prejudice ' is one of the greatest adaptations of any classic book that has yet been filmed. This is due in large part to the masterful screenplay written by Andrew Davies. He has managed to lace together all the pertinent dialogue scattered about the chapters into cogent conversations without resorting to anachronistic modernisms. This allows the film to flow seamlessly and in a very satisfying manner. ,/review/rw0353942/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 1998,ROCKY-19,," It's about time!
","After so many years of seeing adaptations of Pride and Prejudice on stage, screen and television, I had long given up hope of an entertaining and faithful adaptation. Then a miracle!  Class, style, humor and intelligence is alive and well! Direction, script and cinematography are all exceptional in A&E's production. Imagine watching a six-hour program over and over and over. It has to be done. Jennifer Ehle gives Elisabeth all the archness, tenderness, and homey wit that Austen could desire. Each individual cast member gives a memorable performance that makes the character real. Simon Langton, as director, has a real ear for dialogue and silence. Indeed, it is often the silences in conversation that are the most hilarious. The most serious fault in most previous productions was the casting of Darcy. A stiff actor in a stiff part gives you only a stiff character (even, God bless him, Olivier). If Darcy fails, the entire production is a waste. The inspired casting of Colin Firth in this production was defining. Putting Firth, a naturally lively chap, in the role was like harnessing energy. You can often feel that intensity of containment, which is just perfect for Darcy. This is a must-see for any loyal Austen reader or anyone else who likes romance, wit and social commentary all rolled into one. And pity Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility, which opened in the U.S. shortly after Pride and Prejudice debuted. Comparisons were inevitable and did not favor S&S.",/review/rw0353942/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2006,nycritic,10," The BBC Version
","At 300 minutes, it might seem a bit steep to sit through -- after all, the novel is barely under 400 pages and its plot is concise enough to garner a shorter transition from book form to images. But, when you sit and read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, widely considered to be Jane Austen's magnum opus, and savor its miniaturist style, its sharp language, the treatment of even its minor characters as a huge tapestry, there is no other way to create a complete vision of the novel but to do a televised re-working of her novel. (The advent of Emma Thompson and the 2005 movie now proves otherwise.) ",/review/rw0353942/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2005,keng5,10," Doing justice to Jane Austen.

8 March 2011,Qanqor,10," Perfection
","This is the most pointless review I've ever written here, since there are already tons of reviews, tons of praising reviews, and everything that I might want to say has already been said. So nobody is going to find my review, nobody is going to read it, nobody is going to find it useful. It is for this reason that I've put off writing this for so long.",/review/rw0353942/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2014,SimonJack,10," Excellent series of Austen classic not likely to be bettered
","Of the several versions of ""Pride and Prejudice"" I have seen, this 1995 BBC mini-series is by far the best. First, it gives us more of the story than any other version, with 5 Â½ hours of film time. The 1980 minis- series was more than an hour shorter; the 1940 film was under two hours; and the 2005 film was barely two hours. Second, it develops all the characters more fully, including the lesser supporting roles. Third, its script additions to the story seem to fit best Jane Austen's style and plot, so they enrich the story where otherwise we would have holes. ",/review/rw0353942/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2001,Adriane,," Very true to the book (that's why it was worth watching)..
","I am a college student and I love reading classic literature. Jane Austen is one of my favorite writers of all time, and I was very happy with the movie versions of both Emma (with Gwyneth Paltrow) and Sense and Sensibility (with Emma Thompson & Kate Winslet). Both of the books are classics, and the movies are very true to their predescesors. This was no exception. I have read the book, and loved it, and I absolutely loved this mini-series. I was told by my English professor that it was the best version, and I was not happy with the version with Laurence Olivier. The cast was perfect, and how I loved seeing the relationship between Elizabeth & darcy unfold! One of the best 5 hours ever spent on a movie. 10/10",/review/rw0353942/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2004,Tom_Benton,10," Quite simply the most flawless thing I've ever seen.
","Much had I heard of Jane Austen's legendary classic, ""Pride and Prejudice"", and so to kick off my summer I set about reading it. It was possibly the greatest book I'd ever read. I looked up the different screen adaptations of it, and found that Colin Firth had starred in one (I previously enjoyed him in ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" - which is, in fact, a semi-remake of Austen's tale - and ""Love Actually""). So I traveled to my handy-dandy Borders store and picked up a DVD copy. As I walked out of the store, I hoped that I hadn't wasted $40 for this thing. And you know what?",/review/rw0353942/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2012,planktonrules,10," Perfection.
","Having read Jane Austin's novel and seen several other versions of the story, it's easy to believe that I adored this 1995 mini-series. Most of it is because Austin's book is one of the best and most beloved of the 19th century--and all the films try to cram all this wonderful material into only two hours (more or less). You simply cannot rush the great story and so many plots and subplots are omitted or rushed in other film versions. Here, however, there is five entire hours and the story is given what it deserves. It also deserved wonderful locations, acting, costumes and a screenplay--all which it has here.",/review/rw0353942/?ref_=tt_urv

11 July 2006,denis888,10," Classical masterpiece made a fantastic movie
","If there's a film that may be voted one of the best screen adaptations, then Pride and Prejudice is the one. From the very beginning, from the opening captions and sounds of the clavichord, you are tuned to a wonderful atmosphere of the 19th Century Britain. Everything is a winner in this excellent serial. Think of Mr. Bennet Â cold, reserved, true English gentleman, kind at heart and somewhat ice on the surface. Think of absolutely unbeatable Miss Elizabeth Bennet, played by Jennifer Ehle, and here you see the marvelous portrait of a witty, smart, clever lady in full glory. And do not forget of Mr. Darcy, mastered by excellent Colin Firth Â what a brilliant role! He looks so proud, so conceited at first, but then, as the film progresses, he warms up a little and becomes a charming elegant knight. One of the best roles is there of Mrs. Bennet, she is so convincing that you almost have to pinch yourself reminding that it is only a film! Every part in the film Â Lady Catherine De Burgh, Lydia, Kitty, Jane, and Mr. Bingley Â is excellently chosen and played with an exquisite touch that says much about the classical British film school. Scenery is another achievement here, one may only admire and contemplate over the majestic hills, green pastures and severely looking castles all around. Dances, costumes, music, mimic, manners, even language and food Â all is executed with a precision that awakes admiration only. Solid 10 points Â a masterpiece!",/review/rw0353942/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2005,voltage11,10," Capital! Capital!!!
","You just don't get much better than Pride and Prejudice, whether you're reading the book or watching the mini-series. I first saw P&P about four years ago, and it was my first taste of Jane Austen. It opened the world of classic literature to me and film adaptations of those classics.",/review/rw0353942/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2007,lauraeileen894,10," Definitive Jane Austen adaptation
","The BBC miniseries version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" will undoubtedly be the yardstick by which all Jane Austen adaptations will be measured. Oh, there have been plenty of entertaining adaptations since then, such as ""Sense and Sensibility"" and the 2005 version of ""P&P"" with Keira Knightley, but it's safe to say that the classic miniseries is the definitive adaptation of a Jane Austen novel. Director Simon Langton captures the essential wit, satire, and suspense of Austen's most character-driven story. ",/review/rw0353942/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2001,pri_e,10," Can watch this thousands of times
","When I first heard of this movie I hadn't read the book yet so I just scoffed at the idea of it.  I finally did read the book and was absolutely moved by it. My favourite  movie is the 1996 version of ""Emma"" with Gwyneth Paltrow so I was looking up other titles and just figured since it was acclaimed worldwide I'd check it out for myself. I was addicted to it !! Once I started watching I had to go right through to the end, it was such a brilliant adaption. I thought Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth had amazing chemistry, they were perfect as Elizabeth and Mr Darcy. The rest of the cast were excellent as well, this is definitely one movie for the romantics and even for comedy.",/review/rw0353942/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Pride and Prejudice-simply sublime!
","The book by Jane Austen is amazing, and deservedly one of the best loved books ever. Out of the numerous adaptations I have seen of this fabulous book, this one is what I call the most definitive of the lot. To sum up this adaptation in one word, sublime would sum it up wonders.",/review/rw0353942/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2002,tazcat39,," Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) Stole my Heart!
","Never having read Austen before, I completely fell in love with this A&E mini series and, although I am a senior citizen,  with  Colin Firth who is wonderful as the Prideful Mr. Darcy. Jennifer Ehle is equally good as the charming but prejudiced Lizzy.  I also enjoyed Benjamin Whitrow as the father of ""the five silliest girls in England"" and Alison Steadman's hilarious rendition of Mrs. Bennett.  I immediately bought the tapes and have watched them over and over.",/review/rw0353942/?ref_=tt_urv

13 November 1999,engxladso,10," best TV series ever!!!
","I'm a typical guy I guess. I like football, sci-fi, action movies, but definitely not period romances! I ended up watching it because my wife had it on. I was quickly hooked, much to my surprise. When it came on again (thankyou, thankyou A&E) I was glued to it all from the start to the wonderful climax. But that wasn't enough! Now we have the tapes and watch them over and over again and I have read the book four times! I don't understand why I don't get bored, but I don't. I just totally love it. I'm not really sure why. Maybe its because it is so much more than just a romance.",/review/rw0353942/?ref_=tt_urv
