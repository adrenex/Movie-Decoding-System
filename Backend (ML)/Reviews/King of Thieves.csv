16 September 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,8," There really is no honour amongst thieves.
","The wealth of acting talent and experience prompted me to want to see this, coupled with an interest in the real life story.",/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2020,planktonrules,4," It's pretty amazing how little I cared about the story nor the cast.
","""King of Thieves"" is a movie based on a daring robbery in April, 2015 where a group of mostly elderly men managed to steal between 13-15 million British pounds. Oddly, however, the film is far from compelling and a bit of a disappointment.",/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2019,FrenchEddieFelson,5," Mundane and unimpressive
","The film is inspired from the true story of the Hatton Garden heist (thus, the script is already half-written) and the main actors are usually excellent. Despite this excellent a priori, the global result is bland, dull and devoid of passion. So boring that I was almost sleepy. As a synthesis: frustrating!",/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2019,Leofwine_draca,4," Awful scripting
","KING OF THIEVES is the third film I've seen dealing with the true-life Hatton Garden robbery in which a gang of elderly thieves made off with millions in stolen jewellery. The first was an awful independent production starring a guy from DOCTORS; the less said about it the better. The second, starring Larry Lamb, was better, but uneven. Sadly, KING OF THIEVES falls somewhere between the two camps, a film let down by very poor scripting.",/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2019,gy-att,8," What did you expect?
","For those who say this movie is slow and low budget: what did you expect? This is not Transformers, there is no Mark Wahlberg or Bruce Willis from the 90's, no CGI, no John Woo feat. Michael Bay. This is just a well delivered true story, brought to you by many of the best actors of our time. And it does not want to be more, so why do you?",/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2018,bob-the-movie-man,8," No honour among thieves.
","What a cast! Micheal Caine; Jim Broadbent; Tom Courtenay; Michael Gambon; Ray Winstone; Paul Whitehouse.... Just one look at the poster and you think yes, Yes, YES! But would this be a case where my expectations would be dashed?",/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2018,sbweightman,5," Great cast, but passable at best.
","A passable and down to earth presentation of the true story of the Hatton Garden Heist with a cast of big names, but little else. Although it shows the thieves as doddering old fools, it also shows them as bitter and greedy career criminals and as such, you can't really root for them, especially when they devolve into squabbling. There's a good sequence as it shows the effort put in to successfully carry out the robbery, but the whole thing lacks drama, and the police investigation in the second half has no personality to it.",/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2019,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," Awesome geriatric film!
","This film was funny and performances were outstanding. Great directing and writing based on true events. Not sure what everyone's whining about, this film was an awesome geriatric film! Don't listen to the wannabe critics, this film is plain fun and entertaining! A well deserved 8/10 from me.",/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2020,JoeytheBrit,," King of Thieves review
","Yet another account of the 2015 Hatton Garden robbery that was pulled off by a bunch of geriatric career criminals, and which seems to hold a strange fascination for filmmakers and audiences alike. This one benefits from a stellar British cast (Caine, Winstone, Broadbent, Courteney, Gambon, Whitehouse) and its decision to focus on the disintegration of the gang's initial cameraderie almost as soon as the heist is underway rather than playing safe with unrealistic feel-good vibes. The real gang were unpleasant men, and to portray them as anything else would be a whitewash. Caine is finally showing his age (he's barely seen moving throughout) but still delivers, as do the rest of the veteran players.",/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2019,TxMike,," Based closely on the Great Hatton Garden heist of 2015, by the ""over the hill mob.""
",I watched this movie at home on DVD from my local library. The cast features several of the best older British actors.,/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2018,nrmurray,4," A metaphor for the actors themselves.
","This film very much feels like a metaphor for the actors themselves, one last go at making some money and it all going wrong. ",/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2020,Prismark10,3," King of Thieves
",The 2015 Hatton Garden safe deposit heist seems to have captured the public's imagination when the robbers turned out to be pensioners. Although they were old lags with long records.,/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2022,bastos,4," Geriatric eleven
","Heist movie based on a true story where the true story seems much more interesting than this boring and uninspired tale. It's a wonder that with such a stellar cast you could make a movie full of uninteresting characters and make one of the biggest robberies in UK history seem like a boring and light affair. There's something wrong with this movie that I can't quite put my finger on, but I think it has to do with the fact that they transformed this story into a light comedy and then tried to correct course by making it a bit more serious but by doing so the movie feels very inconsistent and you just don't care for the outcome of the heist. Didn't like it at all.",/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2020,MadamWarden,3," THIEVES OF MY PRECIOUS TIME
","I can't believe I wasted hours of my previous time watching this twaddle. No twists, no amusing lines, no entertainment. A waste of time.",/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2019,SnoopyStyle,7," love the old dudes but there are issues
","This is reportedly based on the 2015 Hatton Garden safe deposit burglary which took place over the long Easter weekend. A group of old time criminals are gathered by Brian Reader (Michael Caine). His son Basil (Charlie Cox) works a straight job as a fibre optics technician who comes to him with an idea to rob safe deposit boxes in the diamond district. He gathers a crew of old timers, Terry Perkins (Jim Broadbent), John Kenny Collins (Tom Courtenay), Carl Wood (Paul Whitehouse), Danny Jones (Ray Winstone), and Billy ""The Fish"" Lincoln (Michael Gambon).",/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2019,pipedpiper,1," Totally disappointing
",So slow it could have been an advertisement for Geritol definitely disappointing not worth watching,/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2019,daz-31403,4," What a waste of talent
","Some of my favourite old time brittish actors, so this should have been red hot with lots of clever banter, instead just a lot of swearing, bad script, really dodgy music from an era that was rich in great music. Someone should make it again but do a proper job.",/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2019,mcleanmuir,7," This is an enjoyable film.
",It's about a bunch of old guys who performed a robbery so don't expect fast and furious. It's well acted and has some very subtle funny moments. Courtney is very good in his role.,/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2019,kosmasp,8," (not) too old for this s...
",Stuff? That's one thing you could say. You could also just relish in the fact that you have some great actors at work and let go of the fact that they are of an older generation. This may be something that some people may have issues with (identifying and all that).,/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2018,mediablackops,2," Slow, dull, and very disappointing.
","I'm still baffled how anyone can take a true story, gather a list of very talented actors, and then come up with such slow, dull and disappointing film. I actually fell asleep briefly, halfway through.",/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2018,danny-harris67,3," Very poor, slow and unnecessary
","I don't normally write a review but I felt it necessary in this case. For a start, the film is unbelievably dull and very slow paced. The only really exciting bit is the heist and even that has its low points. Great acting but otherwise not worth watching. Also lots of swearing! Normally I don't mind but it was just distracting and it seemed as though the writers didn't know what other dialogue to use",/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv

",The star-studded cast is woefully let down by an appalling script and even weaker direction. What on earth were they thinking?,/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2018,smith-c57,5," Disappointing considering the cast
","With the cast they got together and the true story it is based on this should have been a winner, sadly I don't think it was, poorly written and a bit dull to be honest, caine, Broadbent and company do their best but even they look a bit bored with the whole thing, could've been so good",/review/rw4366122/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2018,hughrcarson,7," Not a classic, but an entertaining nostalgia-fest
