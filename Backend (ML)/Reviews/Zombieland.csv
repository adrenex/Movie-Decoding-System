15 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," One of the best films from DreamWorks.
","Take it from me, this movie is brilliant. Don't go by it's silly child-pandering name, this film is for everybody. From little kids just looking for some simple fun for a little while to adults looking for a more compelling experience that makes you feel for the characters, this one's for everyone. Funny action adventure with some wise words scattered throughout.",/review/rw1898952/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2008,the-movie-guy,8," Cute animated comedy that inspires lessons in life
","(Synopsis) Kung Fu Panda is the story of Po, (voice Jack Black), a sweet, but clumsy Panda who has dreams of fighting with the legendary Furious Five and protecting the city against all threats. The only problem is that Po has no real life experience of kung fu, and his real job is serving noodles at his dad's noodles shop. News of selecting the Dragon Warrior is sent out from the Jade Temple, and the whole city along with Po, go to the celebration. The competition is between the Furious Five: Tigress (voice Angelina Jolie), Viper (voice Lucy Liu), Crane (voice David Cross), Monkey (voice Jackie Chan), and Mantis (voice Seth Rogen). Po accidentally enters the contest and is named the Dragon Warrior. Master Shifu (voice Dustin Hoffman) must find a way to train Po and make him a Kung Fu Master, especially, after they learn that the snow leopard, Tai Lung (voice Ian McShane), is headed their way.",/review/rw1898952/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2008,Chrysanthepop,," Awesome Colourful Kung Fu Creatures
","'Kung Fu Panda' is another delightfully entertaining flick to come out this summer. Osbourne and Stevenson do a fine job in directing. What I really liked about the film is the sincere effort behind it and its lack of pretension and use of clichés. The directors stay focused on the main story which is Po's struggle. I could really relate to Po's dream and love for Kung Fu and his disappointment and lack of faith in failing to be successful in doing what he loves. The stellar voice cast that includes names like Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Ian McShane, Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, David Cross and Randall Duk Kim is impressive but it is Jack Black's show all the way, followed by Dustin Hoffman. Black's comic timing is wonderful as he provides some of the very memorable laugh-out-loud moments and he brilliantly succeeds in making Po both endearing and funny. I would never have guessed that Hoffman was behind the voicing of Shifu. The actor does an excellent job. I wish Jackie Chan had more lines. The music and CGI are good enough. There's a lot of energy. It's colourful and very appealing to the eyes and it's funny as hell. What's not to love? In my opinion, 'Kung Fu Panda' is a winner with both adults and kids.",/review/rw1898952/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2011,claudio_carvalho,7," A True Warrior Never Quits
","In China, the big, fat and clumsy Panda Po is a great fan of martial arts and worships The Furious Five - Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper and Monkey – and their Master Shifu. He works in the restaurant of his father specialized in noodles, but he dreams on being a kung fu hero. When Master Oogway summons the population to announce who would be The Dragon Warrior, he surprisingly points out to the slacker Po, frustrating the expectations of Master Shifu and Tigress. Po joins the academy of Master Shifu that does not believe that Po might be The Dragon Warrior. Meanwhile the evil Tai Lung breaks out the high-security prison where he has been arrested for twenty years and heads to the temple of Oogway, expecting to get the Dragon Scroll and becomes more powerful. The Furious Five tries to intercept Tai Lung, but they are defeated. Now the only chance to stop Tai Lung is the glutton Po.",/review/rw1898952/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,Tweekums,8," Fun animation from DreamWorks
","I hadn't got around to watching this film but as I'd heard good things about it I thought I'd check it out when it was on television. Initially I wasn't sure I'd enjoy it as I'm not really into 'talking animal' films; soon I was ignoring that and enjoying the humour and the story. The story itself is hardly new but tat didn't stop it being entertaining. Po is a panda who dreams of becoming a kung fu warrior fighting alongside the greatest warriors in China; unfortunately for him however he seems destined to become a noodle chef! One day the local kung fu master Oogway prophesied that a dangerous former student is going to escape from prison and return to seek his vengeance and steal the scroll that will make him the legendary Dragon Warrior. Oogway decides that he must find a new Dragon Warrior first; to this end he gathers everybody together to appoint the new warrior. Po is desperate to see the ceremony and in his efforts to see finds himself at the centre of the ceremony and being selected himself. Not surprisingly the five greatest warriors and their trainer are not impressed that a fat panda has been selected over them. When their enemy does indeed escape they head off to meet him while master Shifu attempts to train him. As is the way with such films Po finds that he has hidden depths and learns kung fu, the only question is will he learn the secret of the scroll and defeat the dangerous Tai Lung.",/review/rw1898952/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2008,Gimmickthegnome,10," Finally, Dreamworks Animation has a classic.
","After various 3D animated movies ranging from lacklustre ""star"" movies (""Madagascar""), boring tripe (""Shark Tale"", ""Bee Movie""), and over-rated, over-hyped overkill (""Shrek""), Dreamworks can finally be proud of a truly great film. (Sidebar: I actually enjoyed ""Flushed Away"" and ""Over The Hedge"".) First, the bad. If I could complain about ANYTHING it may be a few of the voices. Besides Po, Shifu and Oogway, the rest of the cast seemed pretty 'phoned-in'. Thankfully, those characters are pretty inconsequential so they're not really missed.",/review/rw1898952/?ref_=tt_urv

","I really wasn't expecting much, other than a few laughs, which would have been OK for a Dreamworks animation movie. But KUNG FU PANDA exceeded all expectations. The story is simple but the execution is superb. It would be really difficult to find something to improve on the production. The voice-overs are really good, esp Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. The animation is very rich and the colors are crisp and bright. The action sequences are breath-taking. The laughs are mixed in at the appropriate moments. The theater was full and it was composed of a mixture of Adults and young kids. This is a fun for all movie. A testament to this fact is that almost the whole crowd stayed for the end credits. This is a very rare occurrence nowadays.\",/review/rw1898952/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2008,3xHCCH,10," The Best Animated Feature in the Past 2 Years !!!
","I LOVED this movie!!!! I even daresay that this is the best animated motion picture I have seen since ""Cars"" two years ago. Although the whole story of an underdog turned champion is admittedly an oft-told retread, the treatment is original and amazing and very engaging, and not corny (unlike a lot of the recent animated films). I cannot stop singing praises to this one. The artwork of the whole movie is fantastically rendered, no exquisite detail was spared in the scenery, the architecture and of course, the lead animal characters.",/review/rw1898952/?ref_=tt_urv

","From the very beginning, Kung Fu Panda had me practically falling out of my seat --- laughing. It was the perfect blend of comedy, heart, and action, all necessary elements in a successful and great animation/CGI film, in the tradition of The Incredibles and (less action, but containing the heart and laughter) Ratatouille, Finding Nemo and Monsters, Inc.",/review/rw1898952/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2008,jakubs-2,10," Exceptionaly visual, funny, action packed and intelligent movie for all ages.
","One of the best comedy movies I've seen, this animation feature is both packed with action and intelligent at the same time. It's yet another variation on ""You can do anything if you believe in yourself"" and carries strong morale and educational message. But the way it's done, the incredible visual side of the story, as well as the dialogs, is just exceptional. You can't but love the fat Panda boy who's dreaming about being the greatest warrior of all China only to wake up to the reality of hawing to serve noodle soup in his father's shop. Unlike his father, who also dreamed but never found the courage to act on it, Panda follows his calling and by ""luck"" get chosen to be the legendary Dragon warrior by the Kung-Fu grand master, the old turtle, to defeat the evil tiger. That's when his training and troubles start. It's really for anyone between 3 and 100 and I laughed and loved it from the titles in the beginning to the very end. Much recommended.",/review/rw1898952/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2010,Rectangular_businessman,8," The best animated film from Dreamworks
","""Kung Fu Panda"" is easily the best film ever made by the Dreamworks animation studio. It was even better than ""Shrek"" and ""Over the Hedge"" (Both very good films) The animation was quite well made: Not only the characters look more ""Alive"" than in many other CGI productions, but also the atmosphere looks stylish and more than adequate for the tone of the film. The characters were very likable and the action scenes were not only very funny to watch, but also were much better directed than other boring live action films like ""300"" or ""Pathfinder"". Jack Black was great in his role as the main character, and the cast did a great job as well. I highly recommend this film to anyone! It has fun, action and adorable and likable characters. This is one of the best films of the 2008, along with ""Wall-E"". ",/review/rw1898952/?ref_=tt_urv

4 June 2008,firstname-lastname-2,8," Wasn't Expecting much - Got a very good movie
",I was almost dreading seeing this movie - we won tickets to the screener and from the first scene I found myself laughing out loud. The movie is so much better than I thought it would be (and that was bad) - I expected the comedy to be slapstick/junior/potty but it wasn't. The story was also good enough to keep my kids focused glued to the screen. The animation is wonderful. Music is tasteful. I can't imagine anyone but Jack Black pulling off the voice though - he definitely made the movie for me. The only thing distracted me was that most of the movie I spent trying to figure out who was doing the voice of Tai Lung (Ian McShane). As mentioned previously in the forums about the pop culture references in this movie - I don't remember one - very nice indeed - it works with some of the other movies but I can do without. This is the first movie in a while I'd like to see again.,/review/rw1898952/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2009,planktonrules,9," Entertaining and quite beautiful
","I had the fortune of seeing this film the same day I saw another Dreamworks film in the theater--MONSTERS VS. ALIENS. Because of this experience, I think I enjoyed KUNG FU PANDA much more, as by comparison it was a much better film. In fact, though the Oscar folks would heartily disagree, I even enjoyed it more than last year's Oscar winner, WALL-E. That's because while these other films looked exceptionally nice, KUNG FU PANDA actually looked as good but offered a lot more entertainment and fun. Sure, it wasn't as deep as WALL-E, but it was enjoyable and didn't try to be a message film. And MONSTERS VS. ALIENS had a great idea, but the laughs were rather sparse.",/review/rw1898952/?ref_=tt_urv

","Kungfu Panda is marketed mainly as a children's movie with very childish style of cartoon-making and Jack Black.

6 June 2008,DICK STEEL,10," A Nutshell Review: Kung Fu Panda
","It seems like this is a movie made for all the fanboys out there,  regardless of what their obsessions are about. You know, being one who  idolizes certain somebodies or some things, and given a day that Fate  decides to throw you a curveball and give you that one opportunity to  come up close and personal to meet and greet your idol in the flesh, or  be thrown into the exact situation that you've always been dreaming  about. What would you do, and would you go weak in the knees or be  overcome with disbelief that you're actually, finally, realizing your  dream?  Panda Po (voiced by comedian Jack Black) epitomizes exactly that in  Kung Fu Panda, and that struck a chord in me and with many in the  audience as well. And for that, no matter how cliché the story would  become, it had already done its deal and made the connection. It is no  wonder it is rated G here, and I expect that the holiday season would  allow cash registers to ring, for animation fans with the different  styles utilized to tell the story (you must be on time and not miss the  opening sequence), for kung fu fans to get a kick out of classic kung  fu moves personified in their animal forms - Tigress (Angelina Jolie),  Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Monkey  (Jackie Chan) - collectively known as the Fearsome/Fab Five, and for  the kids, given the obvious reason that hey, the protagonist is a  cuddly bear. The marketing department, if not already done, should  stock up on the plush toys, not only of the hero, but the supporting  casts as well. And make their younger forms available too, for they  will sell.  Story-wise, I can't help but to note its tip of its hat towards the  Jackie Chan martial arts movie of the past like Snake in Eagle's  Shadow, Eagle Shadow Fist, etc. The formula which follows a misfit with  weak or zero martial arts background having to undergo harsh training  under a kung fu master, finally realizing his true calling in time to  defeat the villain everybody fears. With the Jackie Chan movies, the  demise of loved one always trigger off a chain reaction, but since this  is G-rated, you won't have the pleasure of having blood spilled, but  with so many splatter-type movies in recent times, I have to admit this  was refreshing, and even having animated animals that talked, didn't  irk me as they are just so lovable here, in their own right.  It's an excellent and very even mix of comedy and drama, even though  they are quite cliché at times if you grew up with the formula, but I  thought that was the point. While the trailers might have given away  some stuff, there are still lots more available which are hidden up the  sleeves, and some minor word replacement such as ""suck"" to ""stink"",  though you would likely be able to stay a step ahead throughout and  even guess whatever secrets the movie have, actually are. For its  stylistic training sequences, they became a throwback and a link to the  fore-mentioned Jackie Chan movies. The fight choreography isn't done  shoddily too with its designing of fights true to the characters'  forms, and integrating them all in a manner rarely seen before. Since  it's an animated flick, it was able to, and probably ramped up  whatever's possible in the kung fu fantasy realm, to give us everything  from rooftop flights to an incredible prison break. It didn't waste any  effort in tapping from the wealth of kung fu material, what with the  various names of deadly moves, secret manuals,  teacher-student feuds, and the best part of it all? Humour being quite  unexpectedly well placed, with more hits than misses to break out into  a hearty laugh by the panda antics.  For all its A-list voice actors in the movie, with the likes of Michael  Clarke Duncan, Dan Fogler, Ian McShane and those who provide voices to  the 5 key animals, Kung Fu Panda is clearly a Jack Black and Dustin  Hoffman vehicle. The bantering between the two is priceless as the  latter plays Sifu (duh) the master teacher, a highly-strung and serious  character who has a past they are shameful about (don't they all). And  as his own teacher Oogway (read: Wu Gui, aka tortoise, voiced by  Randall Duk Kim) advises, herein lies an opportunity for Sifu to  rediscover himself when training possibly the next-big-thing (pardon  the pun) Po, whom he foretold as the mythical Dragon Warrior. So begins  the forging of friendship, long lasting bonds and trust between the  two, even though they got off the wrong footing. And you can probably  feel for Po, because for a fanboy type, having your idols scoff at you  at first opportunity, is actually quite painful.  As a kids movie, there's almost always a message to take away. Here,  it's a reminder to believe in oneself, which I guess is a universal  theme to instill some confidence in the young ones. You might not look  the best, nor are the best amongst your peers, but so long as you have  that attitude to want to learn, that should put you in good steed. As a  summer blockbuster movie, it's fun, thoroughly entertaining, and  doesn't try to be too smart. It's likely to be a crowd pleaser across  all age demographics, and an ultimate popcorn fare, so long as you  manage to keep the popcorn away from the thieving hands of the panda.  And with this release beating local film Kung Fu Gecko to the screens,  I wonder what's the status currently on the Nickson Fong project.",/review/rw1898952/?ref_=tt_urv

","There have been many films about China that the Chinese themselves didn't like. They didn't like Disney's ""Mulan"", they didn't like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". This list goes on. Westerners have westernized the stories or included elements culturally offensive or unintelligible, and humour that, in the Orient, just isn't funny. Well, all that has changed. Last night I went to see Kung Fu Panda in Shanghai (in English with Chinese subtitles). Shangahai is the biggest city in China. The cinema was packed. And from start to finish there was non-stop laughter, excitement, and joy. The humour was universally funny, the culture was dead-on, and the story hit home with the Chinese. They could relate to the characters and their situations. They laughed. They laughed until they cried. Visually, the movie was just beautiful to look at. As an adult, I usually don't enjoy watching cartoons. But this one was more fun I've had at the movies in a long time. The timing of the film's release with the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing coming up is perfect. A job well done to all involved with the making of this little gem!",/review/rw1898952/?ref_=tt_urv
