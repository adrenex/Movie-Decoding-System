16 August 2022,irnbru-333,6," Above average young adult drama with strong horror tropes
",Made by the same company as 'Sex Education' this is a very different beast and no comedy. Yes its a bunch of teens at odds with the world and themselves - but this is a coming of age horror story set in Bolton. For once its not a bunch of rich kids at a posh Academy down south.,/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2022,aimesuk,8," Black Mirror with a teen twist
",Really good teen drama with a tragic twist. It has got a feel of Black Mirror combined with a ghost story so if that's up your street you might like it.,/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,roxmewild,6," Passable entertainment
",Before I begin my review I just want to reiterate this new idea from IMDb whereby all reviews must contain 600 characters this to me is ridiculous as there are certain shows series that are so bad it is very difficult to write that much in a review without listing individual plot holes etc which is something I do not like to do! So I end up waffling inherently just to fulfill the required characters.,/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2022,ehlphotography,8," Genuinely likable young people in this clever dark thriller
","What sets this thriller apart is its genuinely likable and believable group of young freinds. It takes its time to really build up their relationships and I loved its use of trademark northern big hearted insulting banter. When the story starts taking dark twists you really care about what happens to them and the bonds and rifts feel real. Red Rose is a sophisticated cyber thriller, but also a wonderfully portrayed warm hearted, realistic drama. Make sure you give it the time it deserves as it is more considered and less showy than a lot of dramas we are used to today,
but the pay off is worth it and it stays with you. There are some really powerful uses of music for key moments. I'm sure we will be seeing more of its talented young cast and I look forward to more from the writers too with their totally believable gritty writing.",/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2022,roobens,4," Really wanted to like it but...
","First and second episode were pretty good and had the makings of something interesting and scary, but the show quickly fell into sloppy, lazy writing and then devolved further until it was relying upon the basic cardinal sin of having characters make stupid decisions and/or not talking to one another properly in order to drive the plot forward. Even though the group of protagonists is supposed to be a Goonies-esque tight crew of friends, they somehow managed to be randomly stumbling around by themselves in various situations right up to the final episode, due to the bad writing and poorly planned or outright nonsensical motivations forcing them into ever more unlikely and dimwitted scenarios to force some level of suspense.",/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2022,Tweekums,8," A dark teen drama set in Bolton
","As this eight part BBC series opens a large group of teens are celebrating the end of their GCSE exams on the moors above their home town of Bolton. One of them, a girl named Rochelle, downloads an app called 'Red Rose' and installs it on her phone. Soon it becomes apparent that this was a mistake; her friends start seeing posts from her that she never made; they appear calculated to drive a wedge between them; especially between her and her best friend Wren. As the summer passes things get more dangerous for the group of friends as they try to discover who or what is behind 'Red Rose'.",/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,Good-Will,3," Decent enough up until the disaster which is episode 5.
",And then it crashes down to a 1/10 rating for sheer stupidity in every respect in that episode. So a 3/10 overall.,/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,kathmummybear,9," Loved it !
",Hats of to all the cast you were awesome ! .The writing was excellent and the dialogue between the characters worked so well and was believable something most writers don't get right .,/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2022,kerryc-95876,10," Brilliant
","Blew me away so gripping and makes you think!!! Very well written loved it,well done to all involved! Very good ending and left it so it could possibly carry on...creepy dark series..",/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,kjjames81,5," A half and half series.
","As my title says, this series had me half and half which means in some ways I was happy with the series and the other half disappointed with it.",/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,Sleepin_Dragon,7," A clever, twisted series.
","After she downloads an app called Red Rose, life spirals out of control for teenage girl Rochelle, who's phone seems to have a life of its own, others download it, and have to discover who's behind it to stay alive.",/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2022,heley78,6," A fair attempt at YA horror
",My husband and I enjoyed this. There was a fairly interesting premise and some good characters however like with a lot of series nowadays are stretched into too many episodes. The 8 could have been condensed to 5 or 6 and then it would have been greatly improved. The episode which seems to just be about getting their exam results was not great.,/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2022,goldingglenn,10," Great cast and an awesome soundtrack
","I love every single character in this series .it is funny but it's a bit freaky and weird,i love that it is made/set in Bolton it makes the characters more believable .not my usual kind of horrorish tv/ movie choice but this really is brilliant (also check out the soundtrack)...I genuinely hope to see a lot more of these actors in the future 10/10...",/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2022,veryprivateswag,7," Not bad...
",Not bad but typical stupid ending and frankly the kids were stupid all through the season. Could have been better but okay to watch if you got nothing else at the moment.,/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,AMZCali,3," Starts off mildly good, gets much better, then a stupid ending
","The first few episodes were just alright. They led us to believe something that wasn't exactly as it seemed to be as we find out later on. In the last few episodes things get much better, more thrilling, and then they end it all with a annoyingly stupid conclusion that has several things happen that in reality would absolutely not be the way people would deal with the situation. If not for the ending, I would have rated this series a 6.",/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2022,The_nibs,4," Blah YA horror
","Obviously intended for a much younger audience, nothing of value if you're over the age of twenty. Rather dull series that's more about tween relationship drama than horror. Any of the horror elements feel really cheaply done, suspense is minimal, story is really predictable. I can't believe people have somehow related this to Black Mirror or Derry Girls (?!) Where do they get off?",/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2022,debbieannwalker-40287,3," Definitely meh!
","Red Rose started off pretty well and I liked the story premise at first, however during episode 2 I realised that none of the characters are likeable especially Wren who is the protagonist. I've watched the whole 8 episodes and It a dragged too much with filler that amounted to nothing and was pretty boring.",/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2022,svader,3," BBC Please!!
",Another poor drama? From BBC.,/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2022,sogoodlooking,1," Yapping tedium had me out after 10 minutes.
",Absolutely nothing memorable. Not a single interesting or evocative line of dialogue. Not one shot or framing that lingered. Not a single character who stood out.,/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,emregan-84395,5," First episode decent
","First episode was ok but just doesn't make any sense after that lol ! Good young actors and actresses, I would of actually preferred this being a drama rather then a horror/suspense despite all the modern technology today an app that speaks to you without you having control over it is just stupid...Throw your phone away ... daft.",/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2022,whatsonstreaminguk,9," Black Mirrors replacement?
",A similar vein to black mirror.,/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2022,evalottieharris,10," Best show on TV right now!!!!
","Red Rose is incredible! It has the hearty, authentic feel of a classic teen drama, with the terrifying suspense and intensity of Black Mirror. The acting is amazing, all of the friends are brilliant! I can't wait to see how it ends! Praying for a season 2!!!!",/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2022,zer-misc,1," Slow, vapid, predictable, groanworthy nonsense
","With a Sex Education look, and decent budget and acceptable acting, this should have been at least average. But the storyline is just abysmal. If you are going to try to be Black Mirror, you need to actually have an idea that isn't completely vapid. Why did i watch this garbage to the end? Blame the wife who hates leaving something unfinished.",/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2022,davidhomer-50002,1," Erratic
",A group of teenagers that don't understand how phones work behave erratically and stupidly for weeks on end. It's annoying because there's some good underlying ideas but damn it's so frustrating.,/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2022,w-68354,2," Are They Paying For Good Reviews???
",This show was so bad!! The acting was terrible and the plot was weak. The characters are so unlikeable and make stupid decisions.,/review/rw8455193/?ref_=tt_urv
