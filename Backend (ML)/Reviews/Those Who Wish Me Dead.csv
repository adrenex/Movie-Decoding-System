12 September 2022,unpaid_movie_critic,6," The Vindicators is a new ""Futurama"", ""Drawn Together"", or ""Inside Job"" !?
","I don't know if I would watch it and like it as a ""Rick and Morty"" because it is just a spin-off. It reminds me about ""Futurama"" and ""Drawn Together"" which is not a good sign because it is kind of repetitive. However, maybe it can become something interesting like a ""Inside Job"" that was presented by Netflix. Honestly, I do not know if I would watch it as a cartoon series and it is so hard to even give a rating to this because again it is just a spin-off. Overall, it seems okay and even could be watchable but I am not super amazed.",/review/rw8539569/?ref_=tt_urv
