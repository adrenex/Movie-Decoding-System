10 January 2017,TheLittleSongbird,8," For a re-imagining, 'Pete's Dragon' impressed much more than expected
","The 1977 'Pete's Dragon' was a favourite as a child. As far as by today's standards, while not a great film and not as good through adult eyes (plus there are better live-action Disney films, especially the timeless 'Mary Poppins'), it's still well worth watching.",/review/rw3531293/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2016,jezfernandez,7," Packs some emotional heft
","This updated version wasn't quite what I was expecting, though surprisingly good. The dominant theme is friendship and family and they explore this through a rather subtle tension. Pete loves Elliot, but he also needs a family (which he finds in surrogate form through Bryce Dallas-Howard, her fianc√© and his young daughter).",/review/rw3531293/?ref_=tt_urv

26 April 2017,Movie-ManDan,9," Although Not A Masterpiece, It Is Still A Magical & Wonderful Gem.
","Ever have films that you know aren't beyond amazing but you love them anyway? Something happens to be hilarious or an old action movie happens to be a fun but you know it won't receive rave reviews. That is how I feel about the more serious remake of Pete's Dragon. Although it has received high reviews, its no ET or Its a Wonderful Life. There are flaws that this movie has, but none diminish the overall quality. In fact, most of the flaws work as both strengths and weaknesses. Regardless of what's good or bad, the movie really got to me.",/review/rw3531293/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2016,bp96-137-679777,10," Kid again
","Liked this a lot. I was 4 when I first saw Pete's dragon way back in '83 or whatever back in England. I remember how much I loved the idea of Pete's dragon. I watched the original a few years back and realized that it was a fairly average musical with an animated dragon. But still!!!! I remember how great the story or idea of a personal dragon was. The modern spin is very sentimental, but never cheesy. Everything was great; from casting to special effects. I really enjoyed this movie. If you remember the old Pete's dragon from back when you were a skid, you'll love this movie. To be completely honest, there were several tear jerker moments. I guess they really nailed down the aspects of a child becoming suddenly orphaned. They also did a really good job if propelling the story so that it never sat idle. Robert Redford played the integral old timer part, but played it exceptionally well as to be expected. It is also relevant to mention that I typically do not review movies I have just seen immediately after I have seen them. This film made an exception for me.",/review/rw3531293/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2017,Imdbidia,6," Lacking magic

28 August 2016,svorva,4," Pete's Big Green Dog
","I worry about taking pot shots at a movie like Pete's Dragon. No one wants a twentysomething's jaded take on a kid's movie. I am aware I am not the target audience. The ticket vendor's surprise at my selection was no surprise to me. What can I say? The other option was an anthropomorphic hot dog. I took the chance because a children's film can be a light fantasy. Disney has taught everyone that ""fun for the whole family"" is not a death sentence. So when I criticize Pete's Dragon, understand I am not assailing aspects of the genre, e.g. the simplistic plot. That's not the movie's goal nor should it be my point. Pete's Dragon fails because it is utterly devoid of wonder.",/review/rw3531293/?ref_=tt_urv

","I haven't seen the original yet, but this is a real family movie. And yes some may be surprised by the fact that the voice of the Crypt Keeper (Tales from the Crypt) is ""speaking"" the Dragon, but that would mean you are not familiar with the versatility of the guy behind the voice and also his body of work (no pun intended).",/review/rw3531293/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2016,AussieMovieReviews,7," A Remake way better then the Original.
","7/10. This is a remake of Disney's 1977 classic, in which a lost little boy (Pete) finds friendship with a dinosaur called Elliot. Now I must say up front that I really was never a fan of the original, I found it dull and boring. It is not a big classic like a lot of other Disney films, but it still has a big following of people that love it. However I am very glad that they went back 39 years later and remade it, I really liked this film and thought it was a great film for the whole family, with heartfelt moments, funny moments and also action scenes that were good fun for adults and children. I have heard criticism of the way this film starts off, with Pete losing his parents, but honestly this is not a put off for young children and is made in a way that is not sad. My two young kids were not afraid in this film at all, and absolutely loved it. Director David Lowery does a fantastic job in this remake for families. Oakes Fegley who plays Pete really does a great job for a young boy, I think he might be one to watch in the future.

20 April 2017,ljmdesign,9," Still teary eyed
","Having never seen the original Pete's Dragon I had no idea what the story was except that it evidently involved someone called Pete and a dragon! From the first few moments I was drawn in and captivated throughout. The dragon itself was wonderful - quite unlike other on screen imaginings. He was expressive and I loved that he didn't ""talk""....something that immediately ruins any suspension of belief - think Dragonslayer's Sean Connery voiced incarnation!!! Please! The film took me through intrigue, joy, pathos, anger, heartbreak and laughter - not necessarily in that order. I cried an awful lot! Great film and if it doesn't touch you then you have no soul.",/review/rw3531293/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2016,marko-kacanski,4," Looks great, feels fake
","I saw this at the recommendation of several critics whose opinions I respect, so perhaps I was expecting too much. Maybe it's just because I'm a 30 year old guy, and this is movie for children. However it may be, I was not moved nor entertained for the two hours of the running time.",/review/rw3531293/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2016,miguelneto-74936,5," Visually cool, but the movie sins very much in script and development of some characters, not to speak of moments very weak, and a direction that is lost in the way.
","Pete's Dragon is another Disney movie of the year, I've never been interested in watching this movie, even having good reviews, and having a good cast, Oakes Fegley, that's fine, Bryce Dallas Howard, Robert Redford, Wes Bentley, Karl Urban and etc, the direction of David Lowery (which I do not know much about his work), is only average, the visual effects are good, the Dragon is very well done, the film that is based on a very old animation , The movie has good points, the soundtrack is cool, the tone of the movie is good, the picture is good, and has cool moments, as well at the end of the movie, the script sins, More is not the biggest problem of the movie, Pete's Dragon amuses in some moments, but it is a weak film, with a script that sins a lot, a direction only median, and a lot of weak performances, and with tiring moments.

8 January 2017,leonblackwood,4," Watchable but I expected Better! 4/10
","Review: This is another bad live adaptation of a Disney classic! They definitely should have made the dragon speak, like Dragonheart, and I was surprised that Pete was able to fit into normal life so quickly, after living in the wilderness from 5 to 11 years old, with only a dragon as his companion. Anyway, whilst on a day out with his family, Pete (Oakes Fegley) survives a fatal car crash, which kills his parents and leaves him stranded in the wilderness. Out of nowhere, a big Green dragon saves Pete from a pack of wolves, and they instantly become the best of friends. From there, I would have liked to have seen how there friendship developed but the director chose to jump six years into the future, were Pete hears construction workers, chopping down some trees. He is soon gets noticed by Natalie (Oona Laurence) who points him out to her mum, Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard) and they decide to take him in. Whilst getting used to normal life, construction worker, Gavin (Karl Urban) sights the dragon, and he instantly sees it as his enemy, so he tries to capture the friendly giant, with his fellow workers. Pete, who named the dragon Elliott, misses his close friend very much, and Elliott constantly seeks for him in the night. When he finally finds him, he see's that he has settled with his new family, so he goes back into the wilderness longing for his close friend to find his way back to him. Meanwhile, Gavin is adamant about catching the dragon, so he continues to try and find Elliott, even though he has the ability to disappear. Anyway, Grace decides to take Pete to see his dragon, with her daughter Natalie, and her father, Mr. Meacham (Robert Redford), who tells stories to little children about seeing the dragon when he was in the woods. Meanwhile, Grace's boyfriend Jack (West Bentley), who happens to be Gavin's brother, gets a note from Gavin saying that they are going to the woods to hunt for Elliott, so they all head out to the wilderness with different intentions. After Gavin finally achieves his goal, Pete & Natalie fight to save Elliott, with the help of Mr. Meacham, and Pete soon realises that Elliott can only survive if he sets him free. A weird but magical tale of a sweet relationship between a dragon and a little boy, who lost his whole world at such a young age. Personally, I think this movie was a bit too serious, and with all of the technology that is available nowadays, the dragon didn't look that spectacular. I also wasn't that impressed with the plot, which seemed weak and lacked wit, and I did find the little boy slightly annoying. Anyway, it's worth a watch, because of the touching relationship between Pete & Elliott but it could have been much better. Average!",/review/rw3531293/?ref_=tt_urv

","In what is clearly the year of films about man meeting nature/animals (The Jungle Book, Legend of Tarzan, Pete's Dragon), Pete's Dragon doesn't manage to bring anything new to the sub-genre.

8 February 2017,Nebulous_Navid,7," A good soul among greedy souls
","Love, Just a one syllable four letter word. So simple yet so powerful. Hatred, a two syllable word, complex but powerful. Both the words are powerful enough in their ways. Both resides on us, but it's us, humans, who have to decide which side we will take, on which word we will act on! Animals are primitive, ferocious, vicious and wild, but it's ours, men's point of view. May be they think of us the vice-versa. We fail to see the beauty of them, beauty of this planet. It's because we look upon them with our greedy eyes and filthy souls. But what of a child, who looked in a different way, . He saw them kind, naive and innocent. He could see the goods in them because he acted on the first word, Love! The message was great. To talk about the direction, it's overall an average, sometimes down to the marks direction! The boy is a brilliant actor, with some help of a good director, he can deliver the goods.",/review/rw3531293/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2017,Wizard-8,," It tries hard, but it's too predictable
","I wasn't a fan of the original ""Pete's Dragon"" movie when I saw it as a kid when it first came out, and it didn't impress me any more when I rewatched it as an adult a few years ago. So my hopes weren't very high when I sat down to watch this remake. But I will admit that to a degree I was surprised. This remake did not fall into the trap of so many modern day family movies by being extremely juvenile in tone - it is surprisingly sober and serious for the most part. Also, this remake did not fall into the trap of other remakes by following the original too close for its own good. Instead, it takes the basic idea of the first movie and goes to a much different direction.",/review/rw3531293/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2016,seigneurou,2," Yawn
","I'm not sure how you can make a story about a dragon boring, but they did with this movie. From the soundtrack to the cinematography, to the acting and storyline, I've honestly seen better movies on Lifetime. My kids fell asleep about halfway through it and I suffered through the predictable storyline and cringe worthy ""feel good"" moments. A Disney movie about a dragon should inspire the imagination, excite us, surprise us, and touch our hearts. This movie fell short in all areas. The last ten minutes of the movie are worth seeing but the lead up to those moments takes far too long. A concentration on better humor to break the nonstop sentimental expression would have gone a long way with this movie. I love fantasy and adventure movies and hopes to share a great evening with the kids. Unfortunately we fell asleep at an overpriced B rated movie.",/review/rw3531293/?ref_=tt_urv

","Remakes are a really hard market to sell to, especially if the remake in question is of a film that's not very old in the first place.
