4 December 2022,icamlett,2," Painting by numbers
","This really is pure pap despite the very good cast and the absolute beautiful location. The plot is so convoluted and contrived that half-way through the viewer basically gives up caring who killed who and why and replaces it with will I survive for six episodes. I did but I have no idea why other than to upset the wife who wanted to switch it off after two. As for Ioan Gruffudd, who plays the lead,, he basically plays exactly the same annoying character that he does in the Australian drama Harrow where he spends most of the time as a voice-over describing the plot twists to the dozing audience. Do yourself a favour and give this a miss!",/review/rw8809639/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2022,hankbrns,3," Waste of talent and time
","Scenery and actors should have been a formula for success, unfortunately it didn't gel. From the disjointed beginning this looked like an bad mix--maybe they changed the script and directors every 20 minutes as a ""new wave"" in episodic drama. It felt like an editor came in with scissors and clipped all the good parts out.",/review/rw8809639/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,rossbadsey,5," Ridiculous
","Back and forwards all the time with irritating parts played by the young counterparts of the main characters and dramatic music score like in a B movie. I was immediately put off at the start by the terrible casting of Ioan's parents namely Rupert Graves and Dervla Kirwan. Considering Rupert is ten years older, Dervla a mere two years older than Ioan I initially thought oh they must be playing his brother and sister in law but no. They even gave Dervla a grey rinse to make her seem more authentic. They should have cast actors in their late 60s or 70s not two actors who are in their fifties. So the whole thing is ridiculous from that point as well as the daft plot. The only thing going for it is the scenery.",/review/rw8809639/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,heatherh-10415,2," Just pay attention to the reviews!
","Well I thought those reviews couldn't possibly be right so I'd give it a go. I have to give the producers 10/10 for their audacity in bringing this load of garbage to the general public. How the stellar cast they assembled actually got through the whole series without giving up is anyone's guess. There was a sort of ""I am Spartacus, no I am Spartacus"" vibe as one by one the characters said ""I killed her, no I killed her"". And the coincidences that just so happened as the series went on! That's six hours of my life I'll never get back so next time I'll pay attention to the reviews. I give it an extra star for the stunning scenery.",/review/rw8809639/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,lucasarts-88947,6," This could have been so much better!
",This could have been so much better! The first big mistake was to have Rupert Graves play Ioan Gruffudd dad especially as there is only 10 years between them both. Rupert is a great actor but you cannot make the father/son gap work without some serious makeup to make the gap would better. The other this is that as someone with dyslexia there are far too many subtitles and the speed is a bit fast so you cannot keep up with what is going on. Also the third point is that the stories didn't also seem to flow smoothly so you felt you bounce a long and jumps with some weird story plots that don't seem to fit or feel relieved to the over all story.,/review/rw8809639/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,christopherlewisallen,1," Worst TV drama ever
","Do not watch this. It is dreadful. It makes no sense. What happened to the book it's based on, how did that get published, who bought the rights and who on Earth finances this appallingly scripted, woefully edited, shambolic waste of everyone's time? There is not one redeeming factor or facet. I wish I could say something nice about any part of it but it is just lamentable tosh. The young versions of the characters are even worse than the older ones. I don't know how as they are truly irredeemable. The journalist is probably the worst character, but that accolade is hotly contested by absolutely everyone involved in this utter embarrassment.",/review/rw8809639/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,stndygx,3," Absolutely horrendous display of cinematography and acting
","This show frankly upsets me as a human being. I take three days off of my job to watch this utter nonsense. I'm crying right now and I hope that really tells you how utterly awful this show was. As I was watching I felt incredibly apologetic towards those who, like myself, had taken time out of their busy lives in order to watch this fantastic four spinoff. Absolutely atrocious. Wasn't expecting this to be so bad coming from a company as prolific as MGM. Incredibly disappointed. Wish I could have read some reviews on IMDB beforehand to save myself the trouble. Please don't waste your time and energy.",/review/rw8809639/?ref_=tt_urv
