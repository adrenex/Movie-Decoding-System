18 February 2021,dklecan,5," OK, but skip the personal stuff
","Was watching midsomer murder episode with the same actress Small just the week before. And I finally realized why midsomer is so popular. Midsomer offers a counterpoint of grisly murders with fun, positive family life and humorous work environment (think Sykes).",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2022,lopezpatricia-06139,1," eee by gum give season 3 a miss
","Season 3 is total t'northern t'crap. I come from that part of the country and after seeing this I shall never return. But by episode 3 of this season nothing significant has happened at all, it's just the mum swigging cheap room temp vodka. The only developments are with the family dynamic of the lead character (who's a really good actress and wasted in this) not interested in her silly Holly Oakes type kids. The whole thing got on my nerves!",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2021,msghall,5," Drab soap opera interrupted by occasional detective work solving murder
","The crime solving part of this series is indeed well done with some solid acting. However, that is only a small part of this soap opera, one that devotes most of its time to romance, break ups, bad relationships, family disfunction and other emotional baggage that have nothing to do with the essential plot. The dreary exteriors contribute to a sense of ennui, leaving the viewer without anyone for whom to cheer or empathize.",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2019,cheekymonkey1275,7," Enjoying it so far
",This is my first review but felt the need due to the criticism of the accents/dialect of the character's. Here in the UK we make programmes and films covering a wide range of accents and dialect. We don't adapt these especially so that none UK residents can understand them. They are what they are and represent the whole of the UK. So to slate a programme for the accents of the actors who are representing a particular part of Britain is rude in my book. I wouldn't do that about American shows.,/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2019,debbiebarnes66,8," Great Start!!
","I really don't understand the negative remarks about this new series..
People seem to watch one episode and pass judgement on a storyline
that hasn't even gotten started yet.
I really enjoyed the first episode.The characters look real and believable
and the underlining storyline,that is developing.",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2019,the_nephilim71,4," The story is the real problem
","It's not the accents or the actors that are the problem, it's the boring and unbelievable story. None and I mean NONE of the main characters are remotely likeable or sympathetic. The main character is probably the least likeable of all. I just can't enjoy a show where there isn't really anyone to root for.",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2019,hesketh27,3," Accent ""criticisms""
","Unbelievable that there are some criticisms about not understanding the accents in this programme. So what? In Britain vast majority can understand differing regional accents and this is a BRITISH programme made for BRITISH native English speakers. If you don't understand put the subtitles on your tv. Do you complain about not understanding Spanish , French or other foreign shows???? It's not particularly good by British drama standards but the accents have nothing to do with it. Deal with or or don't watch!!!",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2019,Lejink,5," Killing on the dock of the bay
","A single-parent cop with difficult kids gets embroiled in investigating a small-town child-murder. Paired with a new partner of the opposite sex, it's not long before sub-plots involving their offspring and naturally the immediate family of the victim rear their heads over six episodes before all is resolved one way or another, but not before a pageant of suspects is presented before the one what done it is surprisingly revealed. Sound familiar? Possibly the broad church of clues provided above will help.",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2022,duckboy-94171,1," They shouldn't have gotten rid of the MAIN CHARACTER !!!
","This show was 10/10 up until s03 but they cut their own throats when they recasted the main character ! Whenever a show does this it 100% guarantees that it will be canceled and myself & I'm sure many more loyal viewers will no longer be watching ""The Bay"" Good luck show runners because you're going to need it! ðŸ™„",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2019,vintagegeek,7," Good Binge Watch
","Overall a good series with splendid actors. A bit dark throughout with everyone's family issues. The working cop mother overload is getting to be an old theme in these series from the UK. All the adults seemed oblivious to their teens lives. The teens do make it difficult these days. Like I said above, it's a good binge watch, there's nothing gruesome and it moves along, for the most part.",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2019,davidsask,4," The Bay Does Not Slay!
","I wanted to like this but each episode became more tedious. It doesn't help that the female lead has no likable factor, her partner had no reasoning for being there, that was shown. The adult families featured, all the actors were so shrew, screaming, crying, acting out. It just goes on and on. One couldn't tell one from another or care about teens. Going back to the start with female cop lead, The beginning of her arc to how ends is for the stupid to belief. Skip It!",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2019,louise-westlake,7," Love a Brit cop drama
","Enjoying this. If you don't understand the accents, put subtitles on. This is a British drama made for a British audience, and we can understand it! Seriously I put on subtitles when I can't understand some drawling US accents",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2021,Sleepin_Dragon,7," It's a good series, with a few frustrations.
","The Bay, with Series two is on, I thought I'd revisit the first, and I have to be honest, my ideas haven't altered since watching this for the first time. Series one is a bit of a mixed bag, It's hit and miss, a good story, good concept, a shock twist, but irritations, mostly with Lisa. Series two, I binge watched over two days, it had me absolutely engrossed, I loved it.",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2019,jinxieb,7," Subplots were a bit much.
","I like the series, but found the subplots of the investigator's children a bit distracting, it's almost like the writers were looking to fill some time. As for the criticism of the accents. I had not problem understanding them.",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2019,e-j-corby-896-722546,8," Great Series, thoroughly enjoyed it.
","So after reading some of the other reviews and complaints about accents I don't know what everyone's problem is. I am not from the UK I'm Australian and had no problem understanding the accents. Maybe because I watch a lot of TV Series with a wide range of accents but seriously if people are having problems with this maybe they should learn to appreciate that other parts of the world speak differently.
Anyway, I really enjoyed the mostly realistic story. I found the characters relatable and likeable. Which speaks to the actors skills.
It was an enjoyable journey being convinced one suspect committed the crime and then a different one the next episode. I always thoroughly enjoy a female lead also.
Here's hoping there will be a season 2.",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2021,nancyldraper,7," Ok but not up to UK Crime Drama standards
","(After viewing the first season/series). It's not a top UK crime drama, but, then again, the UK sets the gold standard for Crime Dramas (or do they call them Police Procedurals). The lead actress seems to have one setting for all the different dramas in her life which limits the credibility of her character. The location is magnificent. The script doesn't leave enough breadcrumbs to allow the viewer to solve the crime before or along with the police so it remains a mystery until the writers decide to declare the criminal. I'm still going to give the first season a 7 (ok) out of 10 and hope for better in the second season. {Crime Drama}",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2020,rachaelgunther,9," Love it
",I am on episode 5 and I love it. Not sure what people are complaining about in regards to the accents. I am Canadian and I have no problems understanding what the characters are saying,/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2022,kjaney,1," I'd rather dig my eyes out with a spoon
","Seasons 1 and 2 of The Bay were just about tolerable. Season 3 however is the biggest pile of badly acted drivel I think I've ever seen. I got through two episodes then had to stop before the sheer awfulness of it made me throw myself under a bus. Grim, grim, grim.",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2019,Tweekums,7," A melodramatic crime drama set in North West England
","Set in the town of Morecambe, this series opens with a woman meeting an unknown man in a bar; shortly afterwards the two have sex in a back alley. The next day it emerges that she is DS Lisa Armstrong. She is called out when two teenaged twins, a brother and sister, have gone missing. It turns out that their step-father was the man she encountered the night before. Rather than tell her seniors she works to hide this fact. As the series continues one body is found but the search for the other continues. Various suspects arise, both inside the children's family and amongst the wider community. Away from the case DS Armstrong's own children are getting involved with some potentially dangerous people.",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv

11 August 2019,NatashaJAmos2015,1," Why such positive reviews? It's awful!
",I'm trying very hard to watch the first full episode but the acting is terrible and I don't like any of the characters. I'm not sure why this rated very well but it did. :/,/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2021,crumpytv,1," Series 2: Truly Awful
","An ensemble of C list support actors and an abysmal script is the best of this drama.
The acting is just shocking.
Daniel Ryan, Joe Absolom and Stephen Tompkinson all in the same cast??
The actors union did the decent think and saved the audience from 6 episodes of the latter by having him assassinated very early on.
I don't know why I put myself through watching until the end, and for what? The case relating to Meds murder was never concluded ... just left hanging it was as though the script writers ................................",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2019,Britinmiami,5," A Poor Broadchurch...
","The story is poor, and the writing is not anywhere near as good as Broadchurch and other similar programs. The red herrings are so obvious that they are boring. There is a lack of top-quality actors and the direction does not help. What it does is make you dislike the actors and characters... There is a lot of unnecessary shouting and bad acting. Unfortunately, the lead actress is not endearing and will never reach Oliva Coleman level. I got half way through the second episode and decided to read through it on Wikipedia as I couldn't watch anymore.",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2019,yutko2004,10," Excellent!
","I binged on the show. Couldn't stop watching. Some of the reviewers complained about the accent, or not being as good as Broadchurch. About the accent...put subtitles as I did. And about comparing to Broadchurch, I think it was as good. Why compare? Just enjoy a show. Nothing is new under the horizon, but the story was good, characters were believable and had a bit of enjoyment to know that even in a police family it can happen....
Watch it! It is good!",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2019,helpmemommy,9," Very enjoyable.
","Had been looking forward to this as I'm a big fan of Broadchurch type drama and it didn't let me down. Can't wait for the next episode.
I didn't have an issue with the accents at all, being from the UK I'm very used to hearing all different accents.",/review/rw4743170/?ref_=tt_urv
