2 September 2009,Terrell-4,9," ""That's Dr. Ellingham, if you please, and what's all this moaning about a little diarrhea?""
","Curmudgeons, if blessed with good writers, can be satisfying house guests. They're irascible, oblivious, often insulting (sometimes unintentionally), but usually with a hint of endearing rehabilitation. Dr. Martin Ellingham, formerly a top-rank London surgeon who now practices general medicine in the Cornish town of Portwenn, not only has first-rate writers, he's blessed by having as his impersonator the actor Martin Clunes.

10 January 2014,A_Different_Drummer,10," ""House"" in an alternate (and much sweeter) universe
","A British friend tipped me to this show, claiming it was the ""original"" House -- which somehow (typical British subtlety) implies that House is itself a knockoff...? Be that as it may, this show is an undiscovered gem. Martin Clunes, who is very empathetic in real life, plays an uptight Asbergery London surgeon with (no kidding) a phobia about blood. One way or another he ends up in coastal England in a charming little village called Port Wen. It is supposed to be temporary but, hey, every TV series ever made is temporary when it starts. He interacts with the locals and adventures ensue. Kind, gentle, interesting adventures, adventures that at the same time intrigue you on an intellectual level and also make you wish you actually lived in Port Wen. Caroline Catz as the local schoolteacher who our hero falls in love with, in spite of the fact he can barely handle a relationship with himself, is pitch perfect. Brilliant. And addictive.",/review/rw8545854/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2011,lee_eisenberg,," this doctor is always in
","""Doc Martin"" focuses on Dr. Martin Ellingham (Martin Clunes), a surgeon who develops hemophobia and moves to the fictional quaint town of Portwenn on the Cornish coast. Portwenn is full of quirky characters, a perfect contrast to Martin's straightforward attitude. As the series progresses, more and more about the various characters gets revealed. And there are always some neat secrets in store.",/review/rw8545854/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2006,justimarie,9," What a gem
","This gem of a series is lifted out of the sickly-sweet genre of medic/policeman in small quirky country community (often with 'heart' somewhere in the title and 'heartwarming' in the reviews - ugh!) by the spectacular social ineptness of the lead character, Doc Martin, perfectly played by Martin Clunes. Imagine the series if Doc Martin was an ordinary GP, and you'll see what I mean. I was first attracted by the wonderful scenery of Port Isaac in Cornwall (Port Wen in the series)but quickly got interested in how he was going to put his foot in it this week. The story lines are average I would say, some better than others, usually centred on a different medical incident each week, but the real interest is in the relationships between the villagers and the doctor, and how they develop over time. It is always entertaining (and even the not-so-good plot lines are enlivened by the beautiful landscape) and sometimes extremely funny - something to look forward to.",/review/rw8545854/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2006,topvegan,10," A delight every week!
","I thought that the story of an arrogant top-flight London surgeon trying to run a practice in a chummy town in Cornwall would make for a one-note fish-out-of-water series, but instead it has been a delight every week. Doctor Martin Ellingham, for a reason that will be revealed later in the series, decides to transplant himself to a seaside village in Cornwall where he spent a few summers as a child with an aunt, who presently runs an organic farm there. Being a terse, intensely closed, firmly impersonal fellow, he is appalled at the ways of the village people who consider themselves as one big, happy, nosy family. Of course, in a series like this, we expected the clash of cultures between the coldly efficient doctor and the quirky little town to be the main storyline, but it is the diversity of their quirkiness (some of which will surprise you!) and the inventive medical cases that call the doctor's attention, and the personal incidents that test his patience, that will keep you coming back for more each week. While there is a lead cast -- Doctor Ellingham (who intensely dislikes the too familiar ""Doc Martin"" that people insist on calling him), the head schoolteacher who develops an interest in him, despite herself, the affable teddy bear of a police constable, the exasperating receptionist with a chip on her shoulder, and the jokey, prank-loving plumber played by the wonderful Ian McNeice -- none of the characters that show up fleetingly in the beginning is actually a one-off. Eventually, everyone's back story is brought to the fore. This makes the town more and more three-dimensional and you may find yourself caring quite a lot for the individuals that make up this engaging little village; yes, even for the irascible doctor, whose own back story is rather quite poignant and makes his unbending personality more understandable. The best thing about the series is that it accomplishes all this without the schmaltz that usually ruins programs of this genre. For intelligent, humorous and charming entertainment, spend an hour in the village by the sea of Doc Martin. Who knows? Maybe someday, people will be trying to find Portwenn in the same way that fans of veterinarian-writer James Herriot have been looking for his fictional Darrowby. I would certainly give it a try.",/review/rw8545854/?ref_=tt_urv

","Doc Martin is as close as it gets to perfection. Martin Clunes and Dominic Minghella should (and I'm sure do) take intense pride over their creation. The writing is the best in the business, the director Ben Bolt is amazing, and the acting is subtle, natural, hilarious and touching.

17 October 2018,Bored_Dragon,7," Relaxingly addictive
","A prominent London surgeon suddenly begins to suffer from haemophobia, and therefore leaves surgery and goes to the small coastal village to be a general practitioner. But neither he feels good about local mentality and customs, nor villages like his uptightness and arrogance. Martin Clunes is brilliant in the role of a socially handicapped doctor who is clumsily trying fit into, for him, a totally abnormal environment. The series is slow paced and very relaxing, moderately colored by drama, comedy, and romance, and although it is far from the masterpiece of television, it is incredibly addictive. Last night I finished the first season and so far I rate it",/review/rw8545854/?ref_=tt_urv

11 May 2015,planktonrules,9," Basically, it's a soap opera in the guise of a medical show.
","""Doc Martin"" is a very enjoyable British series that has so far run six seasons--short seasons by American standards and often coming out a couple years apart. Despite this and the occasional turnover of cast members, the show is very well written and enjoyable. My only complaint is that a couple of the characters wear a bit thin, as the writers insist on a couple buffoon-like characters for comic relief. The worst of these is Police Constable Penhale who is just too idiotic to believe. To a lesser extent, the same could be said about Bert Large. Fortunately, the other characters and story lines are excellent and make up for occasional lapses. Overall, it's a very well crafted and enjoyable show about a curmudgeonly doctor with abysmal people skills and the bizarre, almost ""Green Acres""-like community in which he lives.",/review/rw8545854/?ref_=tt_urv

21 September 2012,snideelf,10," Great alternative to American Television
","That first receptionist on the first season of Doc Martin makes that season unwatchable. Happy they did not keep her for that role. The accents on Doc Martin are all good here, all different. Except for the accent used by that actress. Very difficult to hear. Grating. The absurd braided hair she wears is almost as if the writers are mocking an obnoxious black actor but decided not to look for any people of color to be on this series.",/review/rw8545854/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2012,pebbleannem,10," Doc Martin delivers!
","I do not understand why some people do not understand why they love this series nor understand why they love Doc Martin. Some dedicated viewers really don't understand why they are so hooked! So I shall tell them why they love Doc Martin. Doc Martin is real. I am a registered nurse and have worked in the Operating Room (theater, if you are picky) and I can tell you this man exists. That is why I switched to the Medical Floor, to get away from the Doc Martins of the hospital. Good grief, they are intimidating. It takes years to find out how weak and vulnerable and sad they are. When a patient codes and doesn't make it, the Doc Martins of the world are left to handle their grief and feelings alone. Isn't that sad? We notice (and love) Doc Martin first of all because he oozes alpha male chemistry and we react to that with a mixture of love and hate, contempt and admiration. We love him second of all because he has transcended most of his feelings (unlike us) and has moved to a higher plane of capability because of it and we benefit from his capability and confidence. We love him thirdly because he needs our love and he has been so mistreated and has such voids within him. There are all kind of subtle clues that Doc Martin is wonderful, but none so telling as the fact that dogs love him and are not impressed by his screams and sneers. You cannot fool a dog! Why does America love this series so much? Because the British do a much finer job than we do at so many many film endeavors. From the impeccable casting to the brilliant writing and believable dialogue to the ability the British have to plumb the depths and soar the heights of human drama and comedy without having holes and gaps that need filled with obscenity or worse. Thanks to the British for their genius. They are even brilliant in the way they use color to match the characters to the environment and create an ambiance that disarms the viewer. I love British films and ""Doc Martin"" best of all. I suspect another reason America is enthralled with the Doc Martin series is because we Americans are having socialized medicine crammed down our unwilling throats, and watching socialized medicine in action adds a certain little touch of horror spice to the story that Brits probably do not even notice.",/review/rw8545854/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2009,etc502,9," Nice to keep up with what's good about the UK while far away.
","Being an ex-pat Brit, I am well aware of how the country has changed in many ways not to my liking, but one thing they still do so well in the UK has not changed, and that is dramas of this genre. I lived in various parts of the English countryside as a kid, and I know that eccentric characters like this really do abound. As for the comment about the local lovelies, you should try the seaside towns of Cardigan Bay in Wales, a goodly number of beauties there, I assure you, it must be the bracing sea air. Regarding another comment, I too went to the church and lit a candle to pray that nobody in Hollywood will even think of making an American version of this very charming drama. Looking forward to the fourth series and also hoping for a happy ending, soppy romantic that I am.",/review/rw8545854/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2013,rodear,7," Charming show
","Doc Martin is a charming show and delivers on its promise of warmth and fun. The setting is charming with many warm characters in the town which are juxtaposed against the cold and overly clinical main character, Doc Martin. Viewers get to explore the frailties and oddities in the human condition in all the characters including the main one. There is nothing especially great about the show; it isn't groundbreaking or overly clever. Just simple charm. The show isn't hilarious but rather amusing, nice. This is a perfect show for people tired of the overly complicated, overly preachy, overly violent, overly sexual, overly PC shows provided by US TV.",/review/rw8545854/?ref_=tt_urv

I love every aspect of this from storyline, characters, dialogue to location filming. I've enjoyed every season and even the repeats.

21 May 2006,mitchell-81,9," Among the best TV dramas to come out of Britain
","This is a question as well as a comment. Following the final episode of the Doc Martin series just shown by the Australian Broacasting Commission was the caption ""Dedicated to John Coleman"". I can find no reference to John Coleman on the Doc Martin website. I am guessing he was one of the writers. Am I right? By the way, I loved the series, but one or two things bothered me. The plots were interesting enough and the most of the characters were beautifully drawn, but to some extent some of them were a bit two-dimensional. For example the professionally super-efficient Doc Martin was so rude to everyone that one could hardly believe that any of his patients would ever come back for more. The policeman was (at least until the final episode) unbelievably inept, if not dim-witted. Sorry but I couldn't accept the snake bite episode, when the Doc displayed more patience with the mad forest ranger than he had with the entire village of (reasonably) sane people. The final episode was by far the most believable and the best. On the credit side I found the casting perfect, the setting idyllic and the photography exquisite. The whole thing was so beautiful it made me wonder why I ever left the dear old place. Is there to be more? Dennis Mitchell.",/review/rw8545854/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2013,PartialMovieViewer,10," ""Welcome to the Wacky World of Pregnant Pauses and Awkwardness""
","Doc Martin is the man! Talk about someone being blunt – to the point – and never pulling punches. Give this man a cape, make him fly and put a letter on his chest – he is my medical super hero. I am not really into doctor shows since most tend to target women over men. I prefer shoot 'em ups, car chases and pointless violence, and – shockingly - this show has none of that stuff. The reason I started watching, 'Doc Martin', was because I lived in Cornwall for a number of years and just wanted to see the landscapes and seascapes of the West Country. Experiencing this part of Britain is unique since you almost become a part of a living postcard of breathtaking vistas and fantastic sights. Back on topic, I normally never watch doctor shows (except for 'House' maybe). U.S.-generated medical shows are usually overpopulated with politically correct whiners, and bloated with overtly 'sex centric' tokenism. The U.S. writers exhaust themselves embracing agenda driven story lines and tiresome 'in-your-face' social awareness messages. Doc Martin seems to be written by grownups and actually embraces reality (in a somewhat fun and odd way). Calling people stupid and ordering them to shut-up is a preferable bedside manner in some cases and such an important part of the character's charm. Martin Clunes and Caroline Cats work so well together. The two of them are so alike they are different (if that makes sense.) The rest of the cast are so well intertwined – the casting director(s) should be proud and commended for a job well done. The writing and direction are too good and I regret – there is not enough room to expound. All-in-all this is at the top of my list of favorites, I am addicted (as I was with 'Heartbeat' or 'Father Ted'). Keep up the good work.",/review/rw8545854/?ref_=tt_urv

","This started off brilliantly. And it has maintained it to the end. Some series that I have loved at the outset eventually got tired and ran out of puff. This never has. It is as funny and heartwarming as ever. Brilliant characters, the most wonderful setting, and consistently daft and funny, quality writing. I will miss this. Like Porridge and Fawlty, for once, thank goodness for repeats... the Doc and his posse of lunatics (and put upon dogs) will never truly 'die'..... Martin Clunes and his 'team' have created something very special that will stand the test of time. We in the U.
