26 March 2001,marcfantozzi,," I love ""Stand by Me"". I love this
","""Now and Then"" is very simular to ""Stand by Me"". Thats why I saw it. It is a girlie film but I did enjoy it and even own a copy! It's only flaw- it's cliched (but hey, I'm a horror fan, so I really shouldn't complain!). Four friends all aged 12, an over- weight kid that gets picked on. The four friends have to cope with loss, death and of course.... adolescence. All these things were brought up in ""Stand by Me"". Despite ""Now and Then""'s flaws, it is, in general, a great coming of age flick. Well acted and has a great cast of young and adult actors. The comedy is better in this film than it is in Reiner's 1986 hit. And seeing as this is a comedy, it delivers. A fun filled ride into adolescence!",/review/rw5072399/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2000,vmcdavidson,7," Grown-ups are a dull letdown
","In this coming-of-age story set in both the 1970s and 1990s, the younger cast is brilliant and natural, particularly Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffmann. The script soars with female teenage humor, friendship, and pre-puberty naivete -- a sprightly soundtrack of 70s tunes takes older viewers down memory lane. But then, just when the story about four best friends during summer vacation in a new housing development is clipping along at a compelling pace, SLAM! The film jumps forward 20 years and the girls are grown-ups. And at these points, the movie groans along like a garbage disposal with too many potato peels crammed in it.",/review/rw5072399/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 1999,SanDiego,," A movie that mothers and daughters can cherish.
","My daughters (ages 10 and 12) and I love this film, we cherish this film. We laughed, giggled, cried, hugged, and bonded.  I highly advise this film to all mothers and daughters.  Some warnings.  There is a brief scene where some skinning dipping boys are chasing the girls who have stolen their clothes.  It begins with a very quick shot of an older boy's penis as he flips into a pond (I didn't see at first, but my daughters did after repeated viewings and use of the pause button), followed by a discussion of male erections by the four girls.  The scene is so well written and handled that parents could actually use it to break the ice in the discussion of sex with their children.  I did.  The girls then proceed to steal the boy's clothes and are chased on their bicycles by the four boys who are seen nude from the rear.  This scene is played so innocently and cute that a parent need not worry about it, though I have noticed my girls rewinding that scene.  A parent should not worry about their children viewing this film, however, the parent should watch it with their children.",/review/rw5072399/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2001,movies2u,," Even Though It's A Girl's Movie, I Liked It.
","Now and Then is a good film that has a likeable cast and is funny and expresses friendship. Yes, it is definetley a girl's movie, but even though, I enjoyed it. The movie is like Stand By Me, except it shows girls's perspectives. The film is a good and fun movie to watch for fun. I give Now and Then a 9 out of 10.  :)",/review/rw5072399/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2003,Darkest_Rose,10," I Love This Movie
","Now and Then used to be my favorite movie when I was younger and it still remains one of my favorites. It's about four friends that have made a pact when they were younger that if one of them ever needed each other they would be there. Now that time has come. Chrissy( Rita Wilson) is about to deliver a child and she wants her friends to be there. Roberta( Rosie O'Donnell), Teeny( Melanie Griffith) and Samantha(Demi Moore) have all arrived and are about to reunite again. While all this is happening, Samantha is telling the story of their childhood and how their friendship began. In the younger days, samantha is played by Gaby Hoffmann, Roberta by Christina Ricci, Teeny by Thora Birch and Chrissy is being played by Ashleigh Aston Moore. This movie is absolutely wonderful, it puts me in such a great mood. The story is just so great, i could watch the movie all over again.It makes you think that real friends do exist. I would give Now And Then 10/10",/review/rw5072399/?ref_=tt_urv

27 November 2005,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,10," Very hilarious and touching movie about the power of friendship
","NOW AND THEN, in my opinion, is a very hilarious and touching movie about the power of friendship. If you ask me, it makes you and your friends stop and evaluate your friendship. I know it certainly made me stop and evaluate my friendship with my really close friends. All in all, this was a very good movie. In conclusion, if you enjoy buddy movies, and you haven't seen this very hilarious and touching movie about the power of friendship, I highly recommend it! You're in for a real treat and lots of laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. If you miss it, I guarantee you you'll regret it.",/review/rw5072399/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2018,classicsoncall,8," ""I say we make a pact. Here and now.""
","Enough reviewers here on IMDb have made a comparison of this film to ""Stand By Me"" that for me to mention it, it would be redundant. Nevertheless, the story did have a Stephen King vibe to it for a number of other reasons. It's a small town coming of age story told in flashback, with the character of Samantha (Demi Moore) narrating her experiences in the past and present with her closest childhood friends. The King novel ""It"", admittedly a horror story, possibly serves as a better comparison to ""Now and Then"" in as much as both have a cast of characters who have made a pact to reassemble as adults if any one of them needs help for a stressful situation. If that weren't enough, the storm drain scene had me dreading some demonic clown villain reaching out and grabbing Samantha to pull her under, until I realized that as the narrator, she would have to have survived that awful experience in order to tell the tale.

15 May 2007,eddiethomson,7," Cute, Wholesome, Family Flick.
","This was a great family flick. It was funny and charming. I watched this film with my girlfriend, when she picked it out at Blockbuster I cringed at the fact of having to watch it, but you know, I admit, I enjoyed this film a lot more than I though I was going to. It was cute, the plot was good, it actually kind of reminded me of another fantastic film called ""Stand By Me"", but in a girl's perspective of course. If you have young children, heck, if you don't have young children, give this one a shot. This is a film I think any Female would probably enjoy. If your a dude, put away all your manly inhibitions for about an hour and a half, don't expect too much going into the film, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",/review/rw5072399/?ref_=tt_urv

13 November 2005,whpratt1,10," Very Down to Earth Film
","Missed viewing this film in 1995 and was able to enjoy viewing all the great actors in the film and the wonderful portrayal of young girls growing into a very warm and loving relationship. Rosie O'Donnell, (Dr. Roberta Martin), played an excellent role as a young girl who had a very bad habit from childhood of eating food all day long, non-spot. Melanie Griffith, (Tina,'Teeny' Tercell) was a very charming gal who desired to become a great sexy movie star and arrived at the gals reunion with a stretch limo and driver. Demi Moore,(Samantha Albertson), played a very troubled young gal, who seemed to be lacking in love and the full meaning of life. This film showed very clearly how young gals confront young boys and in one scene in the old swimming hole of Summer, the gals stole the boys underwear and left them stark naked, except for a few towels the young boys were able to cover up with. Enjoy!",/review/rw5072399/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2003,jay50,," Stand By Me for Girls
","This is a cult classic girl movie and i still watch it today. Although I did not enjoy the 'Now' version of the film, where the four girls are grown up and re-uniting, mostly because i feel the characters dont really like eachother anymore, i loved watching the 'then' part with the four girls growing up in 1970's USA. The excellent soundtrack just adds to the uplifting feeling of this film. Watch as we follow Christina Richie and friends growing up through fun times (Devon Sawa getting his clothes stolen) and bad times (Richie finding out how her mum died). Look for an early performance from Brendan Frasier as a soldier back from war, and Thora Birch before she got all serious! Excellent film.",/review/rw5072399/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2014,Shopaholic35,10," One of the best adolescent nostalgia movies ever made.
",I see a lot of people comparing this movie to Stand By Me but the problem with that is if you were old enough to see Stand By Me when it was first released then hate to break it to you but this movie is not targeted at your demographic. Just because something feels like a remake of a movie made a decade before does not mean that the new movie is in anyway terrible. Take Heathers and Mean Girls for example both good movies but in my opinion Mean Girls appealed to me more as it was aimed at my demographic. If you can't judge a movie on it's own merits than perhaps you need to chill a little.,/review/rw5072399/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is a coming of age movie.
That shares the lives of 4 girls grown up to be respectable yet torn up by emotions from the inside. I loved this movie. All 4 girls & women grew up on a promise that they'd always be there for each other. Like there motto, ""ALL FOR ONE.""",/review/rw5072399/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 1999,Rumples,7," Cute and fun
","This is a nice example of a fairly popular genre, the nostalgic growing-up, adventure on the edge of maturity, friendship bonding thing. As already mentioned, the adults are irrelevant and add nothing to the film (not even acting talent). The roles the girls take are all nicely stereo-typical, the princess, the prude, the tom-boy, the 'normal' one - they could have been the Spice Girls! Anyways, if you want to see a cutsie flick that's nostalgic and fairly innoffensive, this could be for you.",/review/rw5072399/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2014,Kruzicle,7," A User's Movie, Not a Critic's Movie
","I watched this movie when I was 11. Like all movies you watch when you are 11, it has that nostalgia value that no critic can touch. Sure, it's not entirely realistic or in any way makes you contemplate your life on a deeper level. It's one of those movies you just accept, flaws and all, because it's catchy and fun and full of childhood nostalgia. The cheese factor is pretty low, compared to many other coming-of-age films. So yes, it may have a 19% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but I will always have a special place in my heart for this movie. And yes, because I'm sure everyone wants to know, I SO wanted to be Roberta. Ps Since when have you had to have 10 lines of text to be considered a review? Wtf IMDb, we are in the culture of efficiency.",/review/rw5072399/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2012,KineticSeoul,6," Can be a nostalgic flick for girls
","Watching this reminded me of the Korean movie ""Sunny"" although this came out first. Well it wouldn't be a shock if the director of ""Sunny"" was influenced by this movie. The dialogue however didn't seem as natural sometimes and seemed like watching some southern novel that isn't really down to earth. It just didn't seem like what a group of women would be saying to each other, but than again the story switches back from the 70's to 90's when it comes to the characters. The dialogue just seemed too safe to be natural despite the sexual stuff and it's a girly movie. Since the 4 main character are 4 girls in the 70's and women in the 90's. Anyways the story is about 4 women getting together after spending there childhood together and reminisce of the past and adventures they had together. Although most of it takes place during a summer. Now I am not a fan of Rosie O'Donnell, to be honest I think she is irritating to watch sometimes. Her character is like the main character or leader of the pack and I thought it was ridiculous her younger version would be played by Christina Ricci. Not that I am a fan of Ricci either, but the comparison is too big to the point you can get confused who is who sometimes when it comes to the younger version with the older version or visa versa. So yeah I don't know if Rosie picked her younger version but it's just absurd. Overall this is a touching movie that most girls and maybe some boys will probably enjoy watching and parents will probably enjoy it as well. It really does give off a nostalgic feel because of the friendship, even if you didn't go through the same things the girls did in the movie. I give this movie a 6.8 because the development of the characters aren't done all that great and somethings are not explained and not for good reasons. Some say this is a female version of ""Stand By Me"" and I agree to certain extent.",/review/rw5072399/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2018,tdh_fbi,8," An underappreciated coming of age classic
","In my honest opinion, ""Now and Then"" should be in the same category as ""Stand By Me"" and ""The Goonies"" as far as children/pre-teen/teen coming of age movies. To some people, it is, but I have yet to see it on one of those big retrospective lists detailing these kind of films.",/review/rw5072399/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2008,gcd70,4," Not incredibly memorable
","Would be ""Stand by Me"" for the girls, about growing up and making lasting friendships. The plot from I.

","Having just recently watched ""Now and Then"" again, I decided to check out what other people thought.
