30 September 2020,muamba_eats_toast,8," Surprisingly good!
",I had low expectations for this knowing it was teen based and thought it might be to childish but the cast was perfect! The action was decent just the right amount of cheesy humour and a pretty good storyline to boot! The DC Universe has itself another TV gem looking forward to season two!,/review/rw7422883/?ref_=tt_urv

","It visually looks good (relatively)
The plot is senseless and mostly childish ..
The characters are annoying and inconsistent..",/review/rw7422883/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2022,D4V1D2411,8," One of the best DC shows
","I was really surprised with how good this show turned out to be. At this point in time, all DC shows, mostly CW shows, were trash and this one seemed to have a lot of similarities with those ones. But I still watched it and Im glad I did. It feels like a perfect classic story of DC. The best of the show is by far, the characters, Stargirl, the entire JSA, all of the ISA, Courtney's family, all of them are the best. Watching them become superheroes and give their best is really cool and is done in a perfect way, they are almost the same from the comics and I love that. Season 1 is by far the best season, the way they introduce the characters and create the conflict is eprfect, I couldnt stop watching the show, and I binged it in like 2 days. The second season was a big downgrade, the characters were still good and the problems they had were interesting but at this point a lot of characters were starting to get introduced, making each character's screentime very little. The villain, Eclipso while good, it wasn't as good as the ISA and sometimes you even forget about him. But the biggest mistake in the second season was the finale, everything felt rushed, characters coming out of nowhere without any explanation and a bad ending for the villain. This second season was dissapointing, but only because the first one was perfect, so it was still good. The third season is the weakest one, because for most of the season instead of a main villain, we have a mistery plot, this sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. There are points in this season in which you feel that nothing has changed and you want something to happen, and while the characters get more development, its not a lot. It is until the last episodes in which things start making sense and are becoming interesting. Still a fine and entertaining season but not as good as the first one and more on pair with the second. It is a shame that this show was cancelled, ecause it was actually good and it felt like it had some more stories to tell. The finale felt very rushed but I prefer that over not getting a finale at all. All I can say is ""It was good while it lasted""",/review/rw7422883/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2020,robfollower,8," Pitch-perfect bit of casting is Brec Bassinger as Stargirl
","I don't think we've ever seen a series like this before. DC's Stargirl is pure, contagious joy, as Courtney gets acquainted with her inanimate-yet-animated staff and all the tricks she can do with it.",/review/rw7422883/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2020,nyxstrix,8," A great start for a pilot!
","This show is way way wayyyyyy better than the other superhero shows on the cw! The reason why is because the cw did not create it, dc universe did. The cw is just airing it on their channel and app so it gets more views! I like how this show revolves around a teenager and not adults like all the other superhero shows do! It makes it way more interesting by her having to go to school and dealing with teenage problems! The fight scenes and cinematography are just amazing!!!!! The only superhero show that even comes close to this is arrow and maybe black lightning! Hopefully this show doesn't just go episode to episode just stopping crime like all other superhero shows which make them boring but actually shows the characters lives and problems and them dealing with that type of stuff and not just stopping crime! From what I can tell it is not going to be like the other shows!!",/review/rw7422883/?ref_=tt_urv

","15 year old California girl Courtney Whitmore (Brec Bassinger) moves to Nebraska with her modern family. Her mother (Amy Smart) has remarried to Pat Dugan (Luke Wilson) who has his own son Mike. School isn't good and she's not happy with her new mixed family. She finds the Cosmic Staff in her basement and discovers that Pat used to be Stripesy, Starman's sidekick. Ten years earlier, Starman and the rest of the Justice Society of America were destroyed by their enemies, the Injustice Society.

They put on the old costumes to become a new young Justice Society.",/review/rw7422883/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show suffers from some of the laziest writing. I guess you get what you pay for... but when the main character, in every episode, seems to totally forget the life lesson learned in the previous episode and bullheadedly push forward, It gets old quickly.",/review/rw7422883/?ref_=tt_urv

27 August 2020,roopesh-chandra-bose,1," A Poor Show
","This is DC just playing up for the millennial crowd. The show is mediocre, childish and irritating at best.
This is what happens when you hire writers who have never read the original comic stories, have no sense of the history and ability that goes into reinventing a great group like the Justice Society.
I just hope there is no season 2.",/review/rw7422883/?ref_=tt_urv

16 October 2021,genbucadd,6," Started strong but ...
","I didn't hold out much hope for Stargirl, mainly because it's a DCEU series, but season 1 surprised me. I really enjoyed watching the main characters get into their stride and the villains, while being a little corny weren't too corny. But then season 2 came along and the moment I saw it was subtitled 'Summer Camp' I knew it was going to go downhill. And boy, has it gone downhill. It feels like the story could have wrapped up in four episodes but has been spread out to breaking point. Like The Hobbit trilogy. Which is a pity because the baddie, Eclipso, had the potential to be a really good villain and brought some dark moments.",/review/rw7422883/?ref_=tt_urv

","The first season was interesting and different. Despite all the negativity surrounding the second season having switched over to CW, I ignored the internet and started watching the 2nd season and MY GOD. SO BORING. Nothing interesting happens and episodes drag on forever on minor things. That Beth person also becomes more annoying and useless than she was before if that was even possible.",/review/rw7422883/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2020,rutedsmarques,4," Disappointing
","I was expecting a really good show because of the reviews but this show is just poor. The plot is just bad, it is shockingly unrealistic and childish. The performance of the actors are not also very good, it seems everything so fake that not even them believe in it.
Don't waste time with this show unless you really don't have anything else to see.",/review/rw7422883/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2020,cs_nighthawk,8," What Batwoman should have been.
","And no, I don't mean uplifting and comical. I mean solid, well-crafted, narrative and visually pleasing. This episode has a cinematography that could very well be featured in a movie. Still too early to tell anything about the plot, but I can already see which characters are going to be relevant based solely on the way they're framed when they show up. That's the director stating ""Hey! Pay attention! This guy is about to do something!""
Hard to tell if they used a double for the acrobatics, but if they didn't and that's actually the actress, then she an extra mark for that.
The only ""but"" I give it, is that they essentially rebooted the JSA we've seen in Legends, Arrow and Flash, which opens the possibility of introducing a new Arrow, a new Flash, and new *everyone else*s, which is not something you do when you have another version of the same character already developed.
A JSA show set in the 1960's would have been ten times better, without the plot devices of modern shows.",/review/rw7422883/?ref_=tt_urv
