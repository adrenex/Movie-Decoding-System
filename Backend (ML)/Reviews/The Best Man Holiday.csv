15 June 2019,bastille-852-731547,7," Well-Made, Thoughtful Yet Ever-So-Slightly Empty Drama
","This independent drama on the effects of gentrification in San Francisco played to strong reviews at Sundance. It's also distributed by A24, and their films are generally very high-quality. Judging from its trailer, the film looked to be a mix of understatedly beautiful aesthetics (including some extraordinary cinematography of the Bay Area,) searing character drama, and social commentary. The film is generally well-made, and some aspects of it are undeniably impressive for a directorial debut.",/review/rw7606286/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2019,howard.schumann,8," Captures the bonds of friendship that transcend changes brought by social and economic dislocation
","The San Francisco I knew as a young man was a place with a sense of community and culture that welcomed the adventurous, the imaginative, the creative, and the marginalized. Though, like every other major U.S. city, it was not always a place of harmony, and some neighborhoods had its dangers for outsiders, yet it was a city with a truly diverse population and a rich bohemian culture which has now all but disappeared. Joe Talbot's first feature, The Last Black Man in San Francisco, laments the heart of a city that has been broken by gentrification but celebrates the beauty that remains. Gorgeously shot by cinematographer Adam Newport-Berra, and aided by a pensive score by Emile Mossei, the film is an affecting work that is based on Talbot's lifelong friendship with Jimmie Fails who plays a fictional version of himself, a young black man estranged from a place that he once called home.",/review/rw7606286/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2019,TxMike,," Semi-autobiographical movie about the changing San Francisco.
","My wife and I watched this at home via Amazon Prime streaming movies. Quite different from most movies, some parts I didn't like, especially when there was lots of screaming or street arguments among the street guys. However the core of the story, involving a young black man longing to reassemble his family after earlier being evicted, is done very well.",/review/rw7606286/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2019,srdas-93585,10," Brilliant
","This movie began as a joke between friends...then those friends: Director Joe Talbot and lead actor Jimmie Fails worked on this project unofficially for 10 years. Each scene is thoroughly orchestrated, nothing is rushed in this film. Nuanced themes are pervasive throughout this visually beautiful movie. I do not believe a movie based in Hollywood could acheive the things this movie has. It is a masterful portait of delusions, the transitory nature of ownership, gentrification, friendship, growth, masculinity, the growing pains of the life, the City as a whole and much more. I give it 10 stars for the fact that I do not believe there was any room for improvement. A new classic.",/review/rw7606286/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2019,kjproulx,10," A Superb, Thoughtful Character Study
","I've been thinking about calling A24 one of the best studios making films today, but it really hit me while watching The Last Black Man in San Francisco. This is a studio that very carefully picks their projects and more often than not, finds great material to release. I now believe they are not just one of the best, but the absolute best of the best, especially when looking at the films released by studios throughout this decade alone. This character study is one of the best films you will see this year.",/review/rw7606286/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2019,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,6," A well-intended tale of melancholy that's sadly quite boring
","Beautifully shot, earnestly acted, effectively melancholy, with a plot that's pretty refreshing, featuring a handful of really strong scenes... but unfortunately as a whole the movie still manages to be quite boring to sit through.",/review/rw7606286/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2019,cgearheart,10," The Critics Weren't Lying
","I had read a review from a gentleman who had said this movie had moved his audience to audible tears and at that point I knew I had to see the movie. It takes quite a bit to make me cry so I took my chances. I was a slobbering mess. I honestly started weeping and I could not stop myself. This film is so special and I can't stress it enough. The fact that it was both a love letter to a friendship and city and that it portrayed two young men as being unique but strong individuals who weren't ridiculously manly was so impressive to me. I won't spoil the film for you but you must see this film, because it's the best I've seen all year. It's beautiful, it's real, it's The Last Black Man in San Francisco.",/review/rw7606286/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2019,earthgirl-54214,10," SPECTACULAR MASTERPIECE
","Wow. I had high hopes for this movie when I saw the trailer, and for once in my life, my expectations were exceeded. I cannot stress enough how beautiful this film is. Try to watch it in theatres if you get the chance because the cinematography is breathtaking. The film created such a dreamy atmoshpere while simultaneously mainting a harsh realism about life in San Francisco. Meanwhile, numerous human themes are explored, including masculinity, racial stereotypes, friendship, gentrification, class, etc. I also commend both Jonathan Majors and Jimmie Smalls (hopefully I spelled correctly) on amazing performances. Smalls' displays more subtle emotion, while Majors shocks you with an Oscar-worthy performance that packs so much emotion. I just wanted to cry the entire time. Sometimes because of the sheer beauty of what was on screen. Everything is enhanced by the brilliant score. I'm done raving, but please do yourself a favor and go watch this movie.",/review/rw7606286/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2019,starjosie,10," Almost more of a poem than a movie.

4 March 2021,IamROCKAS,4," Too many ideas, too little time
","There's no place like home for our main protagonist, Jimmie Fails, portrayed by Jimmie Fails. To him - the only place he wants to call home is the house his grandfather built in the 1950s. He grew up in that house, learning and retelling the story of its rich history until his family lost the house. The displacement Jimmie feels can be observer through most of the shots in the film and gives off a feeling of strangeness and melancholy, a sadness, that just makes you feel bad for the guy, which's interesting to see in the context of the film. And even though I did feel sad watching the story unfold, this movie didn't push out any strong emotional response from me and the whole movie felt like it's better at coming up with interesting ideas than exploring them.",/review/rw7606286/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2019,regonzalez-20510,8," An extraordinary poignant and beautiful film
","This movie is beautifully made, shot and acted. There's a good deal of comedy here. The City is a character and breathes in a way not shown before on film. It's the small places shown, the neighborhoods that don't make it into other movies, the light and the cold. The sense of longing is strong in this film. The characters, all of whom are a bit off, long for a stability that isn't there, but that they all hope for and work towards. This is a movie about people who are being crushed in a variety of ways by the workings of capitalism and keep struggling forward. It's not a political movie or an obnoxious ""message"" movie. Nothing to hit you over the head. It just shows you folks. This is a love letter to a city that ain't there anymore. A place where I grew up but am a stranger. Where the homes I grew up and played baseball in the streets in front of, no one let's kids play in the street in front of anymore. The kids like the housed are too expensive.",/review/rw7606286/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2019,Turfseer,4," Allegory of inner city house squatter remains ambiguous
","The Last Black Man in San Francisco stars Jimmie Fails as a poetic, allegorical version of himself. Jimmie plays opposite Montgomery ""Mont"" Allen (Jonathan Majors) who is his best friend. At first, one might speculate that the two might have a thing for one another-but as the story proceeds, it becomes clear that there is no hint of a sexual relationship between them.",/review/rw7606286/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2019,studiocity1949,9," Does what an indie film is supposed to do
","This one strikes two big nerves: the crisis of gentrification and displacement happening in San Francisco and other cities across the country; and the general absence in most movies of nuanced presentations of Black masculinity. ""The Last Black Man In San Francisco"" scores in both cases. It's a beautiful, moving portrait of friendship and a gut-wrenching story of loss. It does what indie films are supposed to do: make us see things differently. The score is gorgeous. The acting, by pros and amateurs, is excellent. (Jonathan Majors is a standout. And check our Rob Morgan's scene.) Above all the movie is different. Unlike just about anything you've ever seen. Quirky, pensive, angry, melancholic. And despite it's sadness, somehow hopeful. Director Joe Talbot and lead actor Jimmie Fails deliver!",/review/rw7606286/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2019,hrolandwhite,10," Majors is AWSOME.
","This movie may be the best "" San Francisco"" movie made. Jonathan Majors puts on a show, next to Jimmie Fails playing himself. The two of them are truly entertaining for the entire move. Must see if you like movies.",/review/rw7606286/?ref_=tt_urv

29 June 2020,eddie_baggins,7," A handsomely crafted love letter to San Francisco
","As a piece of debut filmmaking and as a love letter to the unique American city of San Francisco, Joe Talbot's dreamlike The Last Black Man in San Francisco offers much for audiences to enjoy as the up and coming director produces a beautiful ode to his every changing hometown, one that is constantly evolving around an every changing cityscape that harbors many stories, secrets and links to the nation's past.",/review/rw7606286/?ref_=tt_urv

","An artsy movie. Very good story, script, and plot. Excellent cinematography, really shows the beauty of San Francisco. Excellent message on gentrification, homelessness, and love. Very good believable acting. The pacing was a little slow, but overall a very good movie. Overall, I'll give it an 8/10.",/review/rw7606286/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2019,eileen2020,," Well-meaning but I would have loved a re-write
","By now folks know the story, or at least the premise. Who isn't against the brutality of the Bay Area tech sector, and its destruction via cash and more cash of the zeitgeist of San Francisco? The forcing out via arson and eviction of poor renters, ditto. Horrendous. But this is a quiet buddy movie, evidently, with a Victorian house as the object of their ... affection? Obsession? There are several women in it, bit parts of no importance. Why? It's all about the guys. Jimmie, the lead, believes -- implausibly to the point of absurdity -- that his grandfather built the house in 1946. He wants to own the house. It means everything to him. This conceit becomes an important part of the story. The music is beautiful, the acting is perfect, the cinematography is gorgeous, but this viewer wanted so much more.",/review/rw7606286/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2019,Red_Identity,," Poetic and lyrical, told with so much affection
","This was a fantastic film. So tenderly made, dripping with so much love and warmth, told so poetically and elegantly. On a technical level it's pretty great, but the story and characters at its core also really hooks you as the film goes along. To me the stand-out in the cast was the co-lead Jonathan Majors. What an incredible performance. I really hope the film is able to take off with award groups, but most of all for Majors' performance to be recognized (although I do wonder if award bodies will instead place him as supporting and whether people here will agree or disagree with that placement).",/review/rw7606286/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2021,SnoopyStyle,8," quietly powerful
","Gentrification is pushing black folks out of San Francisco. Jimmie Fails IV (Jimmie Fails) is obsessed with recovering the family home lost years ago. He would do minor fixes to the house despite the home owner's protest and is often accompanied by his best friend Montgomery Allen (Jonathan Majors). He's been told that the house was built by his grandfather. When a dispute forces the owners out of the home, he sees an opportunity to move in without permission.",/review/rw7606286/?ref_=tt_urv
