8 November 2013,SnoopyStyle,6," nice guy Steve Carell barely keeps the movie going
",Some of the characters from 'Bruce Almighty' return to the franchise. Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) is now the TV anchor from Buffalo who gets elected Congressman. He's living a nice life when God (Morgan Freeman) picks him to be the new Noah. Nobody believes him even his wife Joan (Lauren Graham).,/review/rw1688414/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2009,tml_pohlak_13,8," Don't expect ""Bruce Almighty"" all over again.
","Evan Almighty generated a lot of hype before its release. A lot of people loved Bruce Almighty, and were expecting something just a zany and hilarious in Evan Almighty. Most of them were disappointed: this movie was received negatively by most critics and audiences alike. Well, I liked it! First of all, this movie has been misunderstood, because it was mismarketed. It was marketed as a hilarious sequel to Bruce Almighty (and the trailer made it look that way, too). But, to be perfectly honest, this is more of a family film than a comedy. But it is a really good family film.",/review/rw1688414/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't understand all the negativity towards this movie, I loved it and thought it was just as good as Bruce Almighty (if anything, I think I may prefer it). It's creative, lighthearted, and overall a fun movie that I've watched several times!",/review/rw1688414/?ref_=tt_urv

19 May 2008,MLDinTN,6," a little above average comedy
","This movie turned out to be a little better than I thought. Steve Carroll was funny as usually. The animals were cool too. Some of them were real, but a lot of them were computer generated. I thought the film sent a good message. That spending family time is important and that is what God was trying to teach the Baxter's. I liked the part that Evan couldn't cut his hair or beard and then then the Moses robes added to the effect. I have to take away some praise though with the whole ark floating though Washington DC. That was just plain silly. Wanda Sikes gets some good one liners too.",/review/rw1688414/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2008,Chrysanthepop,," Is That A Llama With A Hammer?
","With a cast of hugely talented comedic actors like Steve Carell, Lauren Graham, John Goodman and Wanda Sykes, I was expecting a laugh out loud comedy. Sadly, Shadyac's 'Evan Almighty' only provides a few such moments. There just isn't enough comedy and at times it's a little too dramatic. Throughout the films, there are only but a very few dialogues that are funny as a result of which actors like Sykes and Graham don't have enough comedy to work with. Carell reprises his role from the prequel 'Bruce Almighty' but this time he's a little more of a nicer guy. Overall, Carell does a good job but he's more in the 'Little Miss Sunshine' mode which brings 'Evan Almighty' down a notch because that kind of character doesn't fully work for this kind of film and it is Shadyac to be blamed for not making something better of something decent. Yet, Carell's the only one who provides comic relief even though it's with limited quantity. His interaction with the animals are awesome to watch. Morgan Freeman is more cheerful and more annoying in this one. Lauren Graham plays the typical housewife and mother well and her reaction to Carell's transformation is excellent. In spite of all it's flaws, it is the last half hour that lifts the film. It builds up the drama and suspense very well and sort of has an adventurous feel. This entire sequence is very well executed. The soundtrack is well used and the songs are nice too. Thus, despite its shortcomings, it's still entertaining, but don't expect a laugh riot.",/review/rw1688414/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2007,hellokristen,8," Think of it as a Light-Hearted Religious Epic, rather than a comedy
","If you go expecting to see a gut-busting laugh-out-loud comedy like the usual Jim Carrey-Tom Shayac production, you'll be disappointed. (But it also doesn't have the bathroom humor -- a relief to me.) ",/review/rw1688414/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2015,anaconda-40658,6," Not As Mighty As Bruce.
","Evan Almighty (2007): Dir: Tom Shadyac / Cast: Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, John Goodman, Molly Shannon: Bruce Almighty regarded the nature of God. Here we witness His power through ordinary people. Evan Baxter is elected into congress and God tells him to build an Ark. He refuses but his hair grows and animals follow him two by two. Directed by Tom Shadyac with a rushed plot but a terrific climax with flood at hand and an enormous boat. Shadyac previously made Bruce Almighty as well as The Nutty Professor. Steve Carell plays Evan with manic energy from his dealing with sudden hair growth to animals taking a sudden interest in him. Morgan Freeman returns as God as a reminder of the Biblical account of Noah. One issue that arises in the screenplay regards whether or not this flood would actually threaten all wildlife?It seems a tad unnecessary to lure in every species for a flood that takes place in a remote place. Supporting roles are complete cardboard with Lauren Graham as Baxter's wife and John Goodman as his pig-headed boss. This will not likely be placed at the top of their resumes. Molly Shannon appears but to many she will always be Mary Katherine Gallagher. On the same level as the first film although the subject matter is different in that both reference different Biblical areas. In this film God points out the theme with A.R.K. Acts of Random Kindness. Score: 6 / 10",/review/rw1688414/?ref_=tt_urv

3 April 2007,marxthedude,7," Not Almighty, but quite All-righty!
","Steve Carell returns as prissy newsreader Evan Baxter, a little less mean-spirited this time around unlike his previous small turn in 'Bruce Almighty'. Of course, Carell was up and coming then but as his box-office success shows, the character responsible for arguably the only really funny scene in 'Bruce Almighty' deserves a film of his own. Shadayac and co. have approached it with a novel (if potentially expensive idea) to make God (Morgan Freeman) appear this time to instruct Baxter to build an Arc and, as Noah did before him, load it full of animals to protect them from an for an oncoming flood. It's an idea that's very entertaining, even if the jokes are less easy than the previous premise. Evan's transformation of appearance and being pursued by eager animals are the main areas of humour here, which means at times the film is thin on the ground. Sentiment comes in the form of Evan's neglect of his family; the audience will know exactly where this will be going, but fortunately the sentiment isn't as annoying as you might believe. It's also very much a family affair, the humour and the language very much for family audiences. Disappointingly, Shadayac, responsible for bringing out two of Jim Carrey's worst performances (namely 'Liar Liar' and 'Bruce Almighty') by letting Carrey overdo it by seemingly telling him to do the whole thing as an impression of William Shatner, mistakenly this time opts to take Carell down a notch. Carell's trademark hysteria and bizarre reactions are in short supply and we have an all together calmer 'Little Miss Sunshine'-esquire turn, which also means the film loses some of it's potential in this instance. Wanda Sykes and co. are merely stock characters needing better dialogue. Does this make it a bad film? Not at all. It's religious tie-ins (if rushed) are quite smart and it's very well directed visually with a great use of music and keeping a steady pace. It is what's on the label, but with a jaw-droppingly impressive final act which will really take you by surprise and could be up there as one of the sights of the summer! You could do a lot worse than enjoy 100 minutes of easy-going fun but if it's a laugh-out-loud roller-coaster you want, you will leave short-changed!",/review/rw1688414/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2017,tavm,7," Evan Almighty was as good a sequel as one would expect to Bruce Almighty
","After 10 years, I finally saw this-the sequel to Bruce Almighty-a few days ago at a hotel in Washington State on DVD with some relatives. We very much enjoyed it with many references to the Noah and the Ark story in the Bible. Compared to the Jim Carrey one, this one was more family-oriented concerning humor but there were quite many hilarious scenes and lines abounded. And Morgan Freeman is usually good in whatever he's in so that's a definite plus. Steve Carell was fine in his bit part in Bruce Almighty and I also loved him in ""The Office"" and The 40-Year-Old Virgin he made the previous year so I managed to find him mostly funny enough in this. Oh, and all those animals appearing was definitely a highlight for us as we were watching it! So that's a recommendation for Evan Almighty.",/review/rw1688414/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2007,ExpendableMan,4," Passion of the Christ, the blood-free version
","One hundred and seventy five million dollars is a hell of a lot of money to spend on even the biggest summer blockbuster. Not even Michael Bay had a budget that big for Transformers, so exactly how Universal Pictures spent that much cash making Evan Almighty is a mystery. They certainly didn't spend it on the script for one thing as the film is not so much a classic comedy as it is Christian flag waving and bar one or two quiet chuckles, you're most likely to spend the duration wondering where the budget went or why Steve Carrell felt the need to slum it in a decidedly average movie at the exact moment when his star profile has begun to rise.",/review/rw1688414/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2007,amit_kumar13,6," Did you say comedy
","Did some one say comedy... this cannot be categorized as a pure comedy and it doesn't come under the cadre of Bruce Almighty and Steve Carell though he tried hard is not match to Jim Carrey. This is not a pure comedy and has its own emotional scenes to counter your comic feelings while watching the movie..... Buy your popcorn and drink before you go to the movie and don't expect to have a pain in your gut because you don't do any big laughing exercise in it. Still it has kept with its pace, being a smaller movie of less than 100 minutes adds to its advantage.",/review/rw1688414/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2008,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,10," One of Steve Carrell's funniest movies
","EVAN ALMIGHTY, in my opinion, is one of Steve Carrell's funniest movies. God (Morgan Freeman) stole the show with every scene he was in. I also laughed when Evan (Steve Carrell) was attacked by the birds in one of his meetings with Long (John Goodman). When Evan was taunted for being asked to build an ark, I felt really touched. It's hard for me to explain why. Still, he was very funny. If you ask me, he was just as funny as God was. There is only one thing about this film that made me feel uncomfortable, and that is are Evan growing a pointy beard. I also felt a little weird, too. In conclusion, if you're a fan of Steve Carrell or Morgan Freeman, I highly recommend this film.",/review/rw1688414/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2007,intelearts,7," A good sequel

18 July 2007,Zingbot_9000,2," So disappointing
",Honestly one of the two most disappointing movies I have ever seen (the other being Big Top Pee Wee). Let me first state that I was really looking forward to this movie. I really liked Bruce Almighty (part one). I also thought the idea of having the sequel being centered around the Noah story was a strong idea. I felt you bring back Steve Carrell and bring back Morgan Freeman. That is was an interesting way to get by without Jim Carrey. Afterall Steve Carrell is a rising Hollywood starthe next Jim Carrey or Will Farrell. I saw the clips of Steve with his beard and Noah get upthe visual looked funny to me. I thought there was room for some funny scenes with Animals.,/review/rw1688414/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2007,TxMike,," Better than I thought it would be, a nice story.
","This is not a subtle movie. Near the beginning we see a dove flying with a twig in its beak, and know it will be a take-off on the Biblical Noah's Ark account. There are crooked politicians out for their own gain. And there is popular TV news anchor Evan Baxter who wants to make the world a better place.",/review/rw1688414/?ref_=tt_urv

29 July 2014,lesleyharris30,7," Steve Carell Does the Best he can with a Mediocre Script,
","Evan Almighty is a good movie with a very promising storyline that definitely could have been done better,and a good comedic cast.The movie is a spin-off to Bruce Almighty focusing on Steve Carell's character Evan Baxter,although in this the character is a lot more likable than Evan was previously.The script was certainly nothing outstanding and there was nothing extremely funny in this,but Carell did the best he could with this script and certainly improved on it,I also really enjoyed seeing Morgan Freeman reprise his role as God.Its nowhere near as good as Bruce Almighty and Jim Carrey's absence won't go unnoticed but Evan Almighty is still an enjoyable movie with some funny parts and also some surprisingly great special effects,I would recommend it to watch if you ever see it on television and have some time to kill.

28 July 2007,sarastro7,7," I can't believe it! They made a funny!
","Okay, this is another movie that has split the internet in half. Almost universally lambasted (by the professional critics, I mean), ""Evan Almighty"" is apparently only liked by people who hated its predecessor, ""Bruce Almighty"". The differences between the two movies are legion. ""Bruce"" was basically a series of sketches strung together by some overall but not terribly important plot line. ""Evan"" is the reverse; a coherent plot-line occasionally punctured by funny moments. I like a story rather than just a sitcom. So sue me, you half a billion people who disagree.",/review/rw1688414/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2007,RCWjr,8," Finally a family film that doesn't try to be anything else......
","The days of family films seem to be relegated to direct-to-video ventures or produced through cable channel production companies that go straight to the Hallmark Channel or elsewhere. But when someone has the audacity to do an all out live-action family film, with of all things, religious/Christian overtones, the paid critic sharks come out eating it to bits. Case in point is Evan Almighty. A film that isn't trying to be a slap in the face like the Shrek movies and the clones that have followed. It isn't trying to teeter on the PG-13/R fence to court kids but also give mom & dad something to smile about. It is a straight out PG film done in the same spirit as family films used to be done back in the 50's through the 70's when Disney was producing quality G and PG live-action films. Thank God we finally get one in the form of Evan Almighty.",/review/rw1688414/?ref_=tt_urv

","I didn't expect much when I bought this film, actually I never even heard there was a sequel to the wonderful Bruce Almighty until I noticed the similar names while browsing in a shop, and I remembered the name Evan. How could anyone forget Evan Baxter from the first movie?
