15 September 2013,rogerdarlington,," Bound to win Academy Award nominations - and rightly so
","In 1976, the rivalry between two brilliant racing car drivers, the British James Hunt and the Austrian Nikki Lauda, came to a head in the almost literally life-and-death struggle of the Formula One championship. American director Ron Howard (""Apollo 13"", ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Frost/Nixon"") and British scriptwriter Peter Morgan (both play and screenplay of ""Frost/Nixon"") have done a terrific job bringing the titanic struggle to the big screen, aided by some excellent casting and powerful sound and cinematography. Those were the days when most years a couple of drivers would be killed, so the stakes could not be higher.",/review/rw4634675/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2014,tomgillespie2002,8," Thrilling character study
","As Asif Kapadia's gripping and extremely moving 2010 documentary Senna  proved, cinema audiences have a thirst for the larger-than-life  characters that inhabit the Formula One track. The sport itself is  frightfully dull (although I'm sure plenty will disagree with that),  but the sportsmen willing to lay down their life for a kick and a  trophy are infinitely more fascinating, especially in the days of lax  safety rules. The sport nowadays is little more than advertising on  wheels, but when the likes of James Hunt and Niki Lauda battled it out  on the track, epic rivalries were created, and no matter how talented  these men were at driving these ""coffins on wheels"", every race could  spell out death.  Rush portrays the clash of two opposing personalities. The long-haired,  dashing Englishman James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) was all about the  adrenaline, embracing the post-race parties and lying with the many  women that would throw themselves at him. He was reckless, willing to  risk his life and others in order to win, but, as described in the  film, there was no better driver in the world in terms of raw talent.  His rival, Austrian Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl), was focused, clinical,  and even helped design the cars he would drive. He was the early-night  type, 'rat-faced' and cold. In every sense, he's the perfect villain.  But where Rush succeeds the most is challenging our early conceptions  of these two characters. There's little fun to be had with Lauda, but  played by Bruhl, he evolves into the underdog of the movie, perhaps the  only one that actually gives a damn about his own life and the life of  his opponents. This, naturally, leads to tragedy and a particularly  wince-inducing scene in which Lauda requires having his lungs vacuumed,  but it's at this point that we realise just what these two drivers mean  to each other. As Lauda watches Hunt claw back some points in the 1976  Formula One season, it becomes clear that these two need each other to  survive. Their hatred of one another only serves to fuel the flames,  and leads to Lauda's defiant early return to the driver's seat, scarred  and bandaged.  Fast cars, beautiful women and exotic locations hardly sounds like a  recognisable workload for Ron Howard, one of the most play-it-easy  directors out there. His past films have been unjustifiably successful,  critically and commercially, never stamping a recognisable directorial  trait onto his work. Yet here, although the bright sheen of the 70's  initially takes some getting used to, he has managed to create a world  that is very much alive, using snappy editing, a pumping soundtrack and  some growing sound design to re-create this world for petrol-heads. But  he doesn't neglect his characters, and evokes the great work done on  Frost/Nixon (2008), which was also a study of two giant, clashing  personalities coming together on the world stage.  Rush is an exhilarating experience, able to distinguish each race from  the next and literally putting us in the driver's seat with the use of  digital cameras. Although it occasionally drifts into formulaic  territory with the introduction of the 'wives' (played by Oivia Wilde  and Alexandra Maria Lara, respectively), Howard cleverly uses this as  an insight into Hunt and Lauda's personalities. Hemsworth is very good  in his first 'proper' post-Thor role, but it is Bruhl that you take  away from the film. How he gets you to initially loath him, only to be  cheering him on at the climax is the work of a great actor, and it's a  crime that he has been snubbed by the Academy this year. Hopefully this  will inspire a host of decent sports movies, as Rush proves that you  can mix character study and even existential musings with the thrill of  sport.",/review/rw4634675/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2013,CalRhys,," A Gripping, Adrenaline-Ridden Fuel Ride From Howard
","Just come out the cinema in York from watching Rush! Oh my god! One of the most intense films I have watched in a very long time with gripping performances from Hemsworth and Brühl! An extremely clever script from Peter Morgan in which he doesn't pick sides, but instead allows the audience to view these characters in their own light.",/review/rw4634675/?ref_=tt_urv

11 October 2013,Horst_In_Translation,8," No better script than reality
","Originally I planned on not watching ""Rush"" at the theater, simply because I lost interest into Formula 1 considerably since the Schumacher years. However, finally curiosity got the better of me and I decided to give it a go. Which proved a pretty great choice as Ron Howard's latest movie makes for a very entertaining two hours. I was vaguely aware of the year season 1976, the developments and outcome of the driver championship and Lauda's spectacular crash of course as you get pretty much reminded here every second weekend when you see him being the co-host of current Formula One coverage. Putting Daniel Brühl into perspective to what I see there, I think he nailed Lauda's character and his very own Viennese charm. Of course, it's different to compare with Lauda now being roughly 35 years older than in the movie and I was not even born the year Lauda ended his career, but I think he made a good job in portraying him. Aside from all comparisons to what Lauda was really like, he definitely created an interesting character that had your eyes glued to the screen during every scene he was in. It's not surprising Brühl is in talks for his first Oscar nomination and it's nice to see him back so strongly, after I was a bit disappointed by his work in recent years, especially in ""Inglourious Basterds"" where his performance wouldn't make my top5 of the film despite having a pretty interesting character.",/review/rw4634675/?ref_=tt_urv

",Those who have seen the trailer will know that Rush is the 'Formula 1 film'.

18 March 2014,Vartiainen,9," Way more than just a Formula 1 sports film
","I liked this film a lot more than I would have anticipated. Sure I knew going in that the two main leads were both brilliant actors - Hemsworth especially has become a recent favourite of mine - but they both exceeded my wildest expectations. They became James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl), down to the smallest of detail, the most delicate of nuance. The 1976 racing season was before my time, but even though I'm just a casual Formula 1 fan, I had heard about it and I knew who these two were. They were such large characters, such giants in their chosen field, that had this film not captured them perfectly, it wouldn't have been half as good as it is now. Luckily Howard's directing and the performances of these two are some of the finest I've seen in a long time.",/review/rw4634675/?ref_=tt_urv

Featured are the world champion from 1975, Austrian Niki Lauda, and his rival Brit James Hunt, seeking the world championship. Lauda and Hunt were quite opposites, the Austrian the focused, precise, calculating racer. It was a profession he was very good at.

","When my wife and I first saw the US trailer for ""Rush,"" my wife asked me, ""Do you want to see it?"" ""Well, it IS a 'racing movie,"" I replied. I have mixed emotions about NOT watching the international trailer, before watching ""Rush,"" because I would certainly have held much higher expectations. First and foremost, ""Rush"" is NOT about Chris Hemsworth's pecs; nor, for that matter, is it that much about about Chris Hemworth's character, James Hunt. ""Rush"" is about two extraordinary men's visions of life and their approaches to racing; and, it is viewed from James Hunt's most famous challenger, Nicki Lauder. Lauder is a technocrat; a man who, at least, appears to ""know the price of everything and the value of nothing."" Hunt is free spirit; one of simultaneously knows the value of everything and nothing. Hunt and Lauder are presented in much the same manner as the two main characters of ""Lonesome Dove"". Like, ""Lonesome Dove,"" ""Rush"" is majestic in its presentation of these two lives. ""Rush"" is poetic in its presentation, absolute precision,from its score, to its cinematography, to its performances to the most both memorable and appropriate score I have heard since ""The Good, The Bad & The Ugly"".",/review/rw4634675/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2019,CANpatbuck3664,10," Criminally Underrated and Extremely Involving
","Formula One racing isn't a sport that I watch regularly but I certainly respect it more than its competing leagues. The tracks are complex, the opportunities to pass are limited and the pit stops must be carefully timed. But this movie isn't current F1 racing, this movie largely takes place in the late 1960s till the mid 1970s where it was far more dangerous and that much more invigorating because of it. We get a classic storyline of two rivals with two very different styles, they had to respect each other due to the sheer magnificence of their driving.",/review/rw4634675/?ref_=tt_urv
