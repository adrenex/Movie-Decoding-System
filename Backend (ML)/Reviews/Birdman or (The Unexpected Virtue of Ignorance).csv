1 September 2019,ehret101,9," Vincent D'Onofrio's character made this show!
","I originally wondered if the character played by Vincent D'Onofrio was written that way or did he create his characters personality. I have since watched Daredevil and see that it is D'Onofrio's acting skills that create his odd character roles.
I believe that you can compare his character in this to Dustin Hoffman in Rainman & Billy Bob Thorton in Slingblade.
10 years was not enough for this show but I loved every episode and now find myself watching anything he is in.",/review/rw1430270/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2002,smokskren,," Series: OK Acting:OK with the exception of D'Onofrio
","Admittedly I am a huge fan of Law & Order, so I am probably a bit prejudiced with regard to Law & Order Criminal Intent.  I have found that the story lines are up to standard the original series set. I feel that the character development in LOCI has tremendous potential.  ",/review/rw1430270/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2007,ccthemovieman-1,9," I Have Certainly Enjoyed The First Three Years
","I have watched the first three seasons of this show, and that's it. (I became spoiled with DVDs and refuse to watch a show anymore interrupted constantly by tons of commercials.)",/review/rw1430270/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2005,draugwenL,," D'Onofrio is a genius.
","I originally didn't care much for Criminal Intent, focusing my energy toward Special Victims Unit. I have done this for years and never much thought about it. How wrong I have been. Vincent D'Onofrio has evolved his character to be hard-nosed, yet sensitive,intelligent, pure, tortured, and easily identifiable to the suspects, not to mention, able to solve a crime off the top of his head to a certain extent. His own past with sexual abuse is beautifully understated. Bobby Goren is the heart and soul of the entire series, constantly stunning me with his genius and beautiful crafting, even being a little bit sexy. I think Goren is magical. All the utter brilliance of his work has made me wonder: Why has D'Onofrio not won an Emmy?",/review/rw1430270/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2001,Christeen,," Intelligent and fun
","I am a long standing fan of Law and Order,the original series. I never could get into SVU, but I love CI. The intelligence of Vincent's character is wonderful and I have fun watching him ""trip"" the bad guys. There is humor and sarcasm that I find refreshing, it keeps the show from being too dark. I don't find this show overly violent at all. The acting and writing are top notch. Definitely my favorite series this season.",/review/rw1430270/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2020,jmat40,8," The more I've seen it the more I liked it.
","I was and am still a big fan of Criminal Intent. Vincent D'Onofrio was the best and it took me some time to appreciate Kathryn Erbe as Alex Eames. The more I watched the two of them together the more I liked their chemistry.
The only two characters I didnt like were Captain Ross who had his good moments and Fallaci who irked me in every way possible. I couldn't stand her. I always liked Alicia Witt who played her but not that character.
Logan, Barack, Wheeler, were also characters I really liked.
Jeff Goldblum and Saffron Burrows were good together alsi for their season.
I look back on CI now thru the repeats and I'm amazed at the guests stars and bit players who were just nobody's starting out back then and who became superstars today.
The number of actors who played multiple characters in multiple episodes is another thing I didn't realize until I started watching the repeats.
I still laugh about the fact that Jay O Sanders played a killer in season 2 and was the Major Case Captain in season 10.",/review/rw1430270/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2003,davezeppelin,," Makes you think more...
","After seeing this show and having watched the other 2 L&O shows, I must say that this one has made me think the most and always has me gripping right to the end just like the other two.  All 3 have become excellent shows and each stands out has forged its own identity.  D'Onofrio is so good it will give you chills at times.  5 out of 5.",/review/rw1430270/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2004,angie-p-ballard,," Can't wait for the sale of Law & Order: Criminal Intent II.
","Seldom do I get attached to TV series, but my personal interest in criminology got me started on watching Law & Order: Criminal Intent.  I came upon the series in its second season and was hooked.  I am fascinated with the ""ripped from the headlines"" plot and the unique way the stories unfold (i.e, the viewer knows something the detectives don't and vice versa). This coupled with the ending (always a surprise) leads one to demand more.",/review/rw1430270/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2020,chris-j-chuba,10," Robert Goren twists messes w/your head
","What makes this series unique is how Goren's character is able to empathize w/the criminals in order to see things other detectives might overlook. In a really great episode, you simultaneously sympathize with and loathe the criminal in equal portions. It's easy for a show to get you to hate someone or to portray them as a good person caught in a bad situation but it takes a rare talent to both feel sorry for someone and be be utterly repulsed by them at the same time.",/review/rw1430270/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2004,WarriorofAres,," Vincent D'Onofrio shines as Robert Goren
","Somehow when I first started watching Law and Order C.I. I couldn't help but laugh at the crook and their lawyers when Vincent D'Onofrio talks circles around them. By the time the criminal and their lawyer realizes what's happened he's already confessed and doesn't even know he's confessed to killing a person. If I had to pick four Detectives that I like, they'd definitely be Briscoe and Green and Goren and his partner. I some how prefer them to some of the Detectives that I've seen on other TV shows. I'd have to say that this is definitely where D'Onofrio shines at his best, if it's a child then he gets down to the child's level of understanding and intelligence and speaks to them using words that they understand, if it's an adult suspect then he simply just talks circles around them until they admit that they've committed the crime without even knowing about it.",/review/rw1430270/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2010,dataconflossmoor-1,10," Chris Noth
","Chris Noth was such a big part of the original series ""Law & Order"" and he was indeed my favorite actor on the show! After becoming world renowned on ""Sex and the City"" he has returned to ""Law & Order"" by way of the compelling spin off series ""Law & Order Criminal Intent"". I like the episodes that he stars in, I am not all that crazy about the episodes that those other two people are in (Ha Ha!!). ""Law & Order"" will probably be the longest running prime time series in the whole history of television. I definitely can fathom all of the ""Law & Order"" television show's appeal!! Chris Meloni is extremely convincing in ""Law & Order Criminal Intent"". I do feel that Chris Noth has been an integral part of the success behind ""Law & Order"" and ""Law & Order Criminal Intent""!! This string of ""Law & Order"" television shows has revolutionized the small screen in terms of how the average American perceives justice and criminal activity in New York City. Budget restraints are what determine a verdict of innocent or guilty. Plea bargaining becomes the necessary evil which placates all parties concerned! Chris Noth has always played a tough guy, and has always been very believable at doing so too! I strongly recommend seeing the television show ""Law & Order Criminal Intent"" and Chris Noth is a big reason why!!",/review/rw1430270/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2020,cbibins-35983,9," The unique detective in Law and Order is Vince D'Nofrio

16 February 2019,kofila,10," An absolute masterclass by Vincent D'Onofrio
","I am objectively obsessed with the darkness of the human mind. The incredibly savage and cruel things one can do to another. The neverending scale of evil. And, to me, that what this show is all about. Vincent D'Onofrio's character just steals each and every one of the shows with his incredible insight and craving for more knowledge, for understanding why. Eventhough the show itself is sort of a standard criminal procedural he brings an incredible depth and curiosity to the whole thing. You can even see on Kathy Erbe's face how honestly moved, captivated and surprised she can get from witnessing this incredible layered performance he brings again and again. He has brought me to tears, bursts of laughter, a feeling of absolute compassion and empathy.. What an amazing experience from a NBC show. Even more if you take into consideration how shallow and empty are all of the other shows not only from the Law and Order family but the whodunnit genre as whole. Thank you, Vincent.",/review/rw1430270/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2013,SnoopyStyle,7," Vincent and Kathryn great team
","This is a spin off of the popular TV series 'Law & Order', except it doesn't follow its formula. This show follows NYPD Major Case Squad's Detective Robert Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio) and his partner Alexandra Eames (Kathryn Erbe). The biggest difference is to concentrate on these two detectives. In that way, it is much more reminiscent of police procedural in the past.",/review/rw1430270/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2007,vlahov,1," Well, actually
","This show actually sucks. And it sucks because of the premise, because of the exploitation of the lower instincts left in the human body and mostly because of the all knowing detective genius Vincent D'Onofrio. In the real life, no one from the law enforcement agency has any possible right to abuse, yell and rant at the suspect without any proves. In the real world the cases are not so easily solved. In the real world, perverts and criminals are all around us but unfortunately, undeservedly, they do not acknowledge crimes as soon as someone wise ass from the police begins yelling at them. Not all suspects are psychologically abused maniacs who are on the edge of their nerves just as to allow some wise ass to smash them at the interrogation room. It is not real. After a few episodes it becomes perfectly clear that it is mr Wolf who has won (the money), not the audience. Cope with that.",/review/rw1430270/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2005,Boba_Fett1138,9," The fantastic Vincent D'Onofrio!
","Yes, this second ""Law & Order"" spin off can be truly called the Vincent D'Onofrio-show! His character is what makes the series always a pleasure to watch, he really is a most excellent actor. I already was a fan of him after ""Full Metal Jacket"" but after watching him in this I can truly say that I love him as an actor!",/review/rw1430270/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2006,Elborn,6," Great stories, but bad leading characters
","For me nothing beats the original LAW AND ORDER series. But Criminal Intent has sometimes great cases, great stories, where you really want to KNOW what's going on and why. Sadly what's really bothering me is how they are solved. It's OK to have a genius like Detective Robert Goren who is so much more clever than the usual detective or his partners. But he is an expert in EVERY little thing in the world, including special import candies from Europe and so on and so on. For me he is just an unbelievable character, no one can know everything. Always. He doesn't even have to sit down and study in a library, he just knows. Thats spoils the series a lot for me, cause solving the case is of course the main part of every episode. If just now and again he would be wrong in something....",/review/rw1430270/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2006,undura2000,," Gorens Character Going?
","I have been watching law and order c.i for a little while now and i think that the show is just great. I read a comment about cutting down ""Goren""'s time on the show. I really disapprove of this myself. That character is the only reason why i watch the show. I believe that he or his character makes the show what it is. Besides from being a devout loyal watcher of the show, this would break my heart. I love the way the char. moves and he talks. He is awesome, and a very important part of the show. There are very few t.v characters that pull me in the way ""Goren"" does. If this character leaves or takes time off of the show, than so will I. Does anyone else feel this way about his character? please respond. By the way the whole cast is just great, and the show needs to stay the way it is.",/review/rw1430270/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2004,robertconnor,," Worst Of The Bunch
","So the Law and Order stable continues to expand. Original Law and Order, SVU, Criminal Intent and soon Trial By Jury. We'll have to wait for Trial... but of the current three, Criminal Intent stands out like a sore thumb. A hallmark of the Law and Order franchise is the ensemble acting within each show, each episode. Special Victims Unit achieves a laudable balance between its nominal stars (Meloni and Hargitay) and other cast members. Each actor is given the opportunity to carve a fully rounded character, even the minor regulars like Tamara Tunie. The same can be said of original Law and Order, regardless of cast changes over the years. Watching L&O and SVU makes me realize how much Criminal Intent strikes a bum note. Characters on the former two shows complement each other, even when friction or tension is written into scripts. In Criminal Intent, there is no balance - how Kathryn Erbe carries on is a mystery. Erbe is as fine an actor as Hargitay (she was chilling in Oz), but is rarely allowed to carry screen time here. Her sole function seems to be to stand around looking amazed and grateful as Vincent solves the case again. The return of Chris Noth may restore the balance. Until then, L&O and SVU rarely disappoint. The 'D'Onofrio' Show rarely pleases.",/review/rw1430270/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2005,NYUndercover2,," Vincent D'Onofrio A Great TV Detective!!
","I first saw Vincent D'Onofrio portraying a GIANT COCKROACH (Men In Black) I thought to myself...wow that's an interesting concept!! A human being turned into an alien bug. But imagine my surprise when I saw Vincent's face, for the very first time in a commercial advertising Law & Order; CI. I just knew I had to see how a ""cockroach"" character could be taken seriously as a N.Y. crime detective. What a pleasant surprise! I fell head-over-heels in love with Mr. D'Onofrio's TV detective character. He's a brilliant combination of Sherlock Holmes and Columbo!! Frankly, he's the ONLY REASON I watch LOCI.

25 July 2006,vodopivec,3," Not the ""Law & order"" I loved to watch.
","After a while, I finally got annoyed with ""Criminal Intent"". The main character, Detective Robert Goren, is all-wise, all-knowing, can give a psychiatric diagnosis in an instant, finds clues right away, regularly breaks suspects when there is no evidence available, etc. All this with his ""stuttering"" approach that just looks like bad acting.
