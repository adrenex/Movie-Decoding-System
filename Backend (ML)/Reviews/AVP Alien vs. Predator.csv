26 June 2022,michael-kerrigan-526-124974,8," Best consumed if you have life experience
","Some of the 'reviews' on here are laughable. They clearly did not understand the nuance of relationships and how romantic obsession can take over people's lives. Ruth Wilson is brilliantly vulnerable, as is Tom Burke, the object of her desire. This is British drama at its best. Don't bother watching if you're wanting a twee romance..... This is bleak viewing at times - but essential viewing all the same. Brilliant from start to finish.",/review/rw8272144/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2022,tomcanning-01815,6," A Reflective Meditation
","This film probably won't change the world. It doesn't contain life-altering wisdom or beautiful moments of insight. It is a very restrained, very subtle piece, essentially a two-handed stage play, with a pair of talented actors delivering understated performances.",/review/rw8272144/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2022,bryanpenguin,10," From oppression to obsession to know I can see clearly
",Living an oppressed life by the standards of her parents and society to the point where you really could not make your own mistakes. By making choices and exploring options and making mistakes and learning from your mistakes brings freedom of I am responsible for my life. I may not like the place where I am at but I can undo it. That is true power. True personal power.,/review/rw8272144/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2022,steveinadelaide,7," Well-acted and intriguing
","I found the psychodrama, TRUE THINGS (2021), to be an interesting movie. It's about a young woman named Kate (Ruth Wilson) who lives on the outskirts of society. She is content with her life until she meets a man named Blonde (Tom Burke) who comes into her life and starts to change everything.",/review/rw8272144/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2022,xenafan40,6," solid six
","There are few films i will watch till the end, i give at least 20 minutes and if it is not absorbing me by then, off it goes and on to the next. It is not outstanding at all, it's general theme or feel is slightly disturbed, like the main character, but i was certainly intrigued to find where it would evolve to. In the end it was a little quirky, if not ""deserved"" ending, which did not really bring closure to the main characters ""position"", or State.",/review/rw8272144/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2022,Victor_Fallon,5," Banal fling.
","Ruth Wilson plays an isolated single woman with low self-esteem who hooks up with a 'bad boy' and that's the whole story. It plays out in slow, miserable, unsuprising ways. Plot development? Never heard of it. This a deeply uninteresting look at boring characters going nowhere. Think Mike Leigh, but without composition, character or compassion.",/review/rw8272144/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2022,Moviegoer19,10," A Great and Gritty Psychological Portrait
","I gave True Things 10 stars because of Ruth Wilson's acting and because of the excellent script. It's about a few phenomena that many women will be all too familiar with. Ruth Wilson plays Kate, a woman in her thirties who appears to suffer from not knowing what she wants out of life along with a healthy dose of depression mixed with low self-esteem and loneliness. She works as a bureaucrat behind a desk, a job gotten for her by her close holier-than-thou friend, Alison. Early in the film, a client sits down across from Kate, wanting to apply for benefits. I'm not sure that his name is ever given; he's simply referred to throughout the film as ""Blond"" because of his bleached hair. Blond has recently finished a jail bid and needs an income. Kate becomes infatuated with and attracted to Blond and they start having clandestine meetings for some hot sex, the kind that presumably has no strings attached.",/review/rw8272144/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,katedrizos,8," I'm entirely impressed
","This movie really accomplishes a lot. On its face it's very understated - there's limited dialogue, it takes place over a short amount of time, there are very few characters, and nothing overtly life- altering happens to anyone. No big speeches, no blow-up fights, no big set pieces, no significant investments of time or money that will haunt the characters. So it's pretty impressive how many complex human experiences it touches on while you hardly even notice anything has happened. It captures why someone might stick around to see where a relationship is going, even if there are some red flags. It captures the fact that sometimes this isn't a bad thing to do. And sometimes it is. It captures how we have to extend trust to new people in our lives, and ways in which extending your trust can be sometimes rewarding and sometimes disappointing. It captures why it might seem like a near-stranger understands us better than our friends and family do. It captures the dynamic of a best friend telling us something's not good for us or not something we can handle. And the fact that sometimes the friend was wrong, but sometimes they did know what they were talking about. It grapples with extending a second chance to someone who's let you down. And it deftly shows the dance we do when a relationship starts off as sexual and then we try to see if it could be anything else.",/review/rw8272144/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2022,radoskeravica,8," Excellent movie and acting
","Great movie that touches upon social expectations of how the life should look like and a struggle to fulfil them. I liked the scene when the main character scrolls through social media and only sees happy couples, relationship goals and crap like that and inevitable compares her life to those 'true things'. Ruth Wilson was great and you can literally feel what her character is going through. It's really difficult to understand all the negative reviews.",/review/rw8272144/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2021,FilmFlowCritics,4," Worse than bad
","So there are those movies, that are really bad and you instantly hate them or they even become successful and famous for how bad they are, like The Room. This movie here has good moments, but then drifts into nothingness and this will be a movie I probably wont remember at all in a few weeks.",/review/rw8272144/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2022,jencliff,7," Worse than bad ? I've seen a lot worse......
","I liked this film.......it has haunted me since I saw it.... Haven't we all in our time become obsessed with
a totally unsuitable boy or girl ? Ruth Wilson plays the "" should I text him or should I not "" character
really well.... Probably this film is suited for for a TV watch than a cinema outing, but held my attention none the less.",/review/rw8272144/?ref_=tt_urv

25 June 2022,jlalcaine,1," False things
","I dont understand why this movie is untilted True Things. The image is allways with the focus only at à point, à face, an eye, all the rest is absolutely out of focus. So the best title will be False Things we does not know anything only what the D. P., or the director want us to know. We lose allways what happens around them, and the context where they are. Ruth Wilson is splendid, but sorry, i look only to 20 minutes of it. It was boring overall all other point of view.",/review/rw8272144/?ref_=tt_urv
