4 December 2021,nancyldraper,7," Premise both interesting and problematic
","This is an interesting take on a current phenomenon, the crime podcast. Poppy Parnell (Academy Award Winner Octavia Spencer) is an investigative crime reporter turned podcaster. So the premise of the series is untangling a mystery per season. The cast and performances are solid. The tone and music are evocative. My biggest problem was with how the series is held hostage to its premise. Because each episode contains portions of a podcast, the pace is dampened by heavy handed moralizations and narrative. The first season's mystery was compelling enough to compensate for it (I consistently rated those episodes 8/great) but, despite the addition of Kate Hudson to the second season, the podcast narrative ground the series to a slow crawl. Overall, I give this series only a 7 (okay) out of 10. {Mystery Drama}",/review/rw7196953/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2021,Just-A-Girl-14,6," Not good!
",The idea of the show is not bad but the writing is just not good! The characters are all unlikable and there's no flow to the show. I'm not a fan of Octavia Spencer but I actually don't think it's her fault. The characters are written in a way that makes them look weak. One minute they have faith and care all about truth and justice and then all of a sudden they couldn't care less. In one scene they talk about how it's impossible to find a certain witness and in the next scene they're talking to that exact witness (just out of the blue). Not to mention that people seem to remember things that happened twenty years ago like it was yesterday. It's not believable.,/review/rw7196953/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2020,jackiee1970,6," Labouring my way through...
","... in order to see where it goes. But it's difficult. Poppy is extremely unlikeable and I'm not a great fan of Octavia's acting here. I also find her relationships with the two men (husband and ex) very mismatched - I cant see either of them being in a relationship with her to be honest.
Aaron Paul is great but he isn't seen as often as needed to hold this cast up.
The Lanie/Josie characters are a bit of a caricature and over-acted.
I'm hoping they will pull something out for the last few episodes that surprises us and redeems the series.",/review/rw7196953/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2020,aadams,3," Lead character is weak
","It's not so much the acting by Octavia, it's the contrast of her commitment to the case which is dramatic and yet shallow at the same time. For a journalist, she is constantly jumping to conclusions and seeming to derive deep insight from superficial efforts. Her lack of real regard for everyone around her -- especially her husband -- makes her unlikeable.",/review/rw7196953/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2020,cocol2,2," Ugh.
","Sorry, this show is so bad. So many good actors, and an interesting premise but the scripting. Good lord. Who wrote this???? And how did these top actors agree with it.
It's so over scripted. Nothing left to subtlety.
Incredibly predictable and goodness gracious, Poppy is the worst.
Basically the show is all about how Poppy is an expert at ruining everyone's life. She's a terrible person and this character is doing Octavia dirty.
I watched to the end out of respect for Aaron and Octavia.",/review/rw7196953/?ref_=tt_urv

26 October 2021,julieshotmail,4," A mixed bag not redeemed by the reveal
","I'm a fan of Octavia Spencer, and mix in the reliable and watchable Kate Hudson to the cast, you have yourself a winner. Or so I thought. The two leads are indeed what keep me going with this whodunnit mystery week after week, however there are some rather boring and uninspired characters like the dad, Shreve. Each scene with him is painfully stale and compels me to just give up on this. Luckily, he is not on that much. Then you have the Joshua character and the detective Aames who look exactly alike, so I keep getting confused if the scene is a flashback with Joshua or present-day with the police. Why utilize two lookalikes playing different roles is beyond me. Then the big villain reveal at the end is quite anti-climactic, as early on when that character first surfaces, you quickly suspect something sinister about her presence. So when she is revealed to be the villain, you almost feel cheated, making the rating of this otherwise-OK series plummet significantly.",/review/rw7196953/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2020,sensorshot,4," With all their Billions
","This is a shame. Apple are arguably the best poised to come up with original drama of all the big players. The writing is as bad as others have been saying. The actors are excellent and actually disprove Harrison Ford's alleged slur to George Lucas that, ""You might be able to write this s++t but you can't say it."" They do well with some utter crap lines and I can almost Imagine them wrapping their head round them. Watch it with subtitles, which I do with my non-native English speaking girlfriend and you end up wanting to applaud Mekhi Phifer for delivering utter drivel so well. Aaron Paul just does what he does and Ocatvia Spencer is excellent, too. But even with this talent.. which lifts it from a 1 to a 4/10 - I would steer clear unless you are an actor who just got a gig on a dull daytime soap and you want to see how grade A actors work with E grade scripts.",/review/rw7196953/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,tonyandsilvia1994,4," Inconsistent
","Series 1 was really entertaining. I'm a sucker for the wrongfully imprisoned trope. Good acting from Aaron Paul and Lizzy Caplan. Series 2 less so. None of the characters are likeable, and it's hard to root for Kate Hudson's character. My main issue is the length. 10 episodes is waaaaay too long. It could have lost 4 episodes easily.",/review/rw7196953/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,riverqueen16,9," Interesting show, keeps my attention
",I don't understand the negative reviews. I find the acting by Octavia Spencer and Aaron Paul (who I love) to be superb. My attention span is not what it used to be so I cannot watch slow moving shows. This one has kept my attention and I don't find myself wandering off because the story line is not just about the plot but also about the characters.,/review/rw7196953/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2019,foomagna,4," Good acting, bad writing
","How do good actors get into these bad shows? When you're reading the script it seems to me that you might just have to say ""well that doesn't make sense"" or ""that's now how the real world works"". I get that this is just a show but it's based is reality, right? I had to stop watching after 3 episodes because there was no improvement and it kept getting more cartoonishly ridiculous.",/review/rw7196953/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2022,sebring-92628,2," I agree with the 'giving up on this"" review
","This show starts off really well with great promise, but after 3 or 4 episodes becomes tedious, boring and very unrealistic. Octavia played her part well but her character....a one woman podcaster so-called police force who suddenly gets Aaron Paul's character to reconsider everything almost immediately after 20 years of prison. She argues with everyone and bites at everyone, a very unlikeable character who suddenly decides she was wring 20 years ago and then gets high on her horse to oppose everyone and everything related to the case, obviously to allay her own feelings of guilt. Repetitive and quite unrealistic. We gave up also. Why do producers now drag what could be a movie or 1 season show out into so many episodes that you tire of it, it moves too slowly and is very repetitive?",/review/rw7196953/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2020,casbarlow77,3," Terrible writing, poor characterisation, too many plot holes
",I find it hard to believe this show has a rating above 7. Rarely do I provide reviews but felt compelled to on this occasion because of the plot holes left by the lame ending. *Spoiler Alert* - it completely disregards the murder victim. Not only does this poor guy get murdered by his daughter based on a lie by his other daughter but no one bothers to correct the fact that he actually didn't abuse anyone. Where is his family in all this defending his reputation?!! And why on earth did Warren's dad shoot himself and lie about his son killing him if he didn't? This makes absolutely no sense.,/review/rw7196953/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is such a well rounded cast! Octavia Spencer is always amazing, I've been a fan for a while. Aaron Paul really surprised me here, he really brought So much emotion to his character. Ron Cephas Jones is also really awesome in here. Such an intense story that makes you feel so many emotions. It really makes you emotional for those who are wrongfully convicted and how much media can have an impact.",/review/rw7196953/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,fuzulu,6," Season 2 is a snooze fest
","I gave season 1 an 8 star review... It was pretty decent, it has a lil drama in it but still decent. Season 2 is absolutely infested with unnecessary time waste drama about the most boring characters, it's just a lot of utter crappy boring stuff added to the main story to kill time and elongate it, I would give season 2 5 out of 10 stars, the main story cudve been ok but they just tried to milk too much screen time out of nothing. Season 1 also has some of that boring stuff, like her family and all but that much could be tolerated but now this is just too much, nobody cares.",/review/rw7196953/?ref_=tt_urv

","Apple TV got it right. I have seen Servant, Home before dark, sending Jacob and now Truth be told. Great mystery series about who done it in a different perspective than a usual. I binged this series in 2 days. Good character development and unveiling of characters are unique. Cinematography is refreshing and adequate. I'd love to see the 2nd season of this.

5 August 2021,barryjames-mc,3," Awful show
","When the leading protagonist is a selfish, narcissistic, sociopath, who only cares about something as shallow as a ""podcast"", you have a shaky premise to begin with. The ridiculous access she gets to information and the potentially libelous, baseless accusations she spouts, is embarrassingly poorly written. She has a suspicion then blabs it out, regardless of evidence, accusing everyone of the crime, all down to her chronic narcissism. Awful, badly written, with albeit good actors. Ridiculous.",/review/rw7196953/?ref_=tt_urv
