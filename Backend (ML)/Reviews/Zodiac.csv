24 August 2004,FilmOtaku,9," There are few films that can make me laugh like this one can
","`Snatch', written and directed by Guy Ritchie is by far one of my favorite films of all time Â– it is easily in my personal Top Thirty.  In the film, about (what else?) several schemes that happen to go very wrong yet manage to intertwine and (for better or worse) resolve themselves in the end, Ritchie assembles one of the funniest cast of characters in recent memory. Let's see if we can keep this straight:",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2003,LivingDog,10," Perfect
","This movie is perfect in all its categories: credits, sound track, production, casting, writing, photography, editing, acting, and direction. 10/10.",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2001,Shiva-11,8," Lock, Stock, and Many Smoking Barrels
","The release of Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" in 1994 prompted a schism in the staid gangster movie genre: the standard hallmarks - serious characters, gunfights, intrigue and damsels in distress - were enhanced with snappy dialogue, and gallows humour.  The biggest change however was the introduction of the mobius strip-style plot line, where the concept of time is no longer linear, instead constantly folding in upon itself, flitting between past, present and future that forces the viewer to pay close attention lest they miss some subtle detail.  Inevitably, numerous copycat films emerged that tried to capitalize on Tarantino's success, but it wasn't until 1998 when Guy Ritchie, an unknown British director, took on the challenge that a successor was found.  Now Ritchie is determined to prove that his first time out wasn't a fluke.",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2016,Leofwine_draca,10," The pinnacle of Guy Ritchie's career
","This sleek, stylish and very effective black comedy-cum crime thriller is an excellent movie, and one of those rare 'perfect' films where it would be difficult to spot one flaw let alone a number. A follow-up to Guy Ritchie's powerhouse debut, LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, this sees the director in familiar territory with a haphazard plot involving a stolen diamond and an Irish gypsy boxer. It doesn't make much sense, there's no story, but what you do get are hundreds of twists and turns and confrontations, some absolutely hilarious scenes of comedy (anything with the dog in it is a classic) and tons of class acting and class actors.",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2002,sllovejoy,," I liked it, is that so wrong?
","I am a 33 year old woman in a flowered dress who doesn't drink, rarely swears, sleeps with a teddy bear, and has never raised a hand to anyone in my life.  But I liked this movie a lot, and according to someone who wrote a review earlier, that makes me personally responsible for the violence in America.  I'm sorry - I never intended to hurt anyone.",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2006,ccthemovieman-1,9," Subtitles A Must To Really Enjoy This
","I would imagine viewers would either really love this movie or be totally turned off. It is presented in a different format for its time (since copied), has very odd and profane characters, accents that are difficult to understand, and tells an unpleasant story with some disgusting scenes. So, why do I enjoy this film, being an old-fashioned so-and-so?",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2001,Keyser Soze-12,9," Just as much fun as Lock, Stock. Snatch is a great and entertaining movie.
","Imagine what would happen if you took 8 or 10 criminals of various professions, threw them into a maze, gave one of the criminals a diamond the size of a fist, and yelled out load, ""SOMEONE IN THIS MAZE HAS A HUGE DIAMOND!  WHOEVER FINDS IT AND IS THE LAST MAN STANDING, WINS!"" What do you think would happen?  Snatch is what happens.",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2000,SpudMons,10," A Comedy Masterpiece
","""Snatch"" is fantastic; and not least because it demonstrates emphatically that the British movie industry is capable of rivaling even the best of what Hollywood can offer.",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2004,marty_666,10," Do You Know What Nemesis Means?
","I was never really too keen on ""Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels"".  All my friends constantly quoted it, raved and ranted, and then when ""Snatch"" came out, everyone made an even bigger deal of that.  I watched Lock Stock, and though I did like it, it didn't really tickle my fancy.  But Snatch, that's a completely different story all together.",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2004,ratpac03,," The way movies -should- be made.
","Read this review carefully, please.",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2000,dazza11,," A movie that has it all
","A film about boxing, diamonds, gangsters pretending to be Jews, a fat getaway driver, a rather vicious dog and man eating pigs. Guy Richie has followed the success of Lock, Stock with an equally stunning and ambitious return just as Tarantino did with Pulp Fiction. The characters are so colourful they jump right off the screen, the dialogue so snappy you want to learn it by heart and the acting simply wonderful. Vinnie Jones reveals he can act and Brad Pitt shows that he is far more than a pretty face and could well win a best supporting actor oscar for his role as Irish Mickey. See this movie!!!!",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2000,willeniams,10," Guy Richie and Vinnie Jones have done it again!
","Guy Richie's follow up to Lock Stock and Two Smoking barrels is every bit as astonishing as its predecessor. The humour is better and I have never seen people in a cinema laugh as loud and as frequently as they did here. Vinnie Jones plays a similar role as Big Chris, here as Bullet Tooth Tony. His appearance is limited but boy does he make an impact. Even when he is not on screen there is much to savour from Dennis Farina as Avi and a trio of pawnbrokers who are sent to rob a bookies. Brad Pitt sheds his movie start personna and preforms impressively as an Irish gypsie. Unlike Lock Stock.. the humour will appeal to all nationalities. However they mind some slang expressions such as Pikey and blag hard to understand. Good preformances, fantastic characters, razor sharp diologue, expert direction and camera work and brilliant humour, Snatch will make you laugh more than any other movie this year. See it now.",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2020,auuwws,9," Snatch
","A very interesting movie, the black and gypsy people in the film were very funny, Brad Pitt created a movie. This is a Russian character who was enjoyable especially the scene of her death, the film villain could have used better, most of the comedy scenes in the film were funny I really enjoyed watching it",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2015,hitchcockthelegend,8," In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary... come again?
","Snatch seems to be one of those spunky British gangster films that critics are divided on, yet it's loved by the target audience. Guy Ritchie has done a Sam Raimi, he has remade the first film that put him on the cinematic map. Where Raimi remade The Evil Dead, and just called it Evil Dead II, Ritchie cheekily tries to get away with remaking Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and calling it Snatch. Sure the circumstances in plotting are different, and there's a big American star brought in to beef things up for the global market, but it's the same movie and without doubt it's lazy film making. But it still - like Evil Dead II - Rocks!",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv

14 April 2010,GirishGowda,10," For Every Action, There's A Pikey Reaction!
","I saw Sherlock Holmes a couple of months ago and it was very good. I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed that and my friends were raving about Guy Ritchie's style of film-making. So, now I wanted to see Ritchie's previous works & rented out Snatch as it was 135 in the top 250 of IMDb. I have to say I was very impressed. I didn't want to know anything about this film beforehand as it takes away something from the experience and told my friends to shut up about the plot of Snatch. This was Jason Statham's second film, he was not so well known and Brad Pitt was already a superstar. This is one of the best films out there and I totally agree with IMDb users.",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2020,meaningbird,10," Might be my Favorite Movie
",So I just saw Snatch and it might be my favorite movie I've ever seen. It is filled with so much fun and funny moments that it made the film so enjoyable to the point where it made me want to write a full review for it. All the cast is great and play their roles really well. The film's comedy is probably the best part about this film. My stomach hurt from laughter because of how funny this film is. This is the end of the non-spoiler section of the review. Another Great part of this movie is the great plot twists especially the one near the end.,/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2001,jcthompson76,," Upping the ante on lock, stock...
","I saw the first showing of Snatch in my town this past Friday.  I loved it. I am quite a fan of Guy Ritchie's first and was expecting more of the same with Snatch.  Rarely do a film's opening credits hype an audience as much as Snatch.  Quick paced action-to-freeze-frame-cuts introduce each cast member in situations that identify their character sort.  Then we're right in it. It's true, similarities abound between Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  From Vinnie Jones' character's tough as nails negotiating means, to oft referred to in-jokes between characters ('Zee Germans' here compared to 'Tubby Tommy' in LS&2SB).  Still the film is fresh and not really a Lock, Stock take 2 of any sort. The humor is more frequent in this one and a major difference is how dark this film is compared to the previous.  Alan Ford's Brick Top is the meanest SOB I can remember on film since Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs.  Brad Pitt is a standout too as the never to be trusted One Punch Mickey-he's not as incomprehensible as the trailers make him out to be, but still that pikey accent is a huge laugh.  And the scene where he is glaring at a burning trailer lumped my throat (when you find the context by which that scene is drawn it should get a reaction from anyone). The use of violence as humor is more embellished in Snatch as well (eg: the Bullet Tooth Tony and Boris the Blade showdown). Secondary characters are all over the movie and all grab laughs from their scenes , especially the dog and the tank of a getaway driver, Tyrone.",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2007,pyrocitor,10," Brutally funny, a stylish masterpiece
","The tightly knit formula for the average ""heist movie"", is constantly in danger of becoming predictable to the point of redundancy with each new increasingly formulaic entry, so to see a film quietly whisk in and reinvigorate the genre was a refreshing feat indeed. And if anyone was up for the task, it was visionary director Guy Ritchie, sweeping into theaters fresh off his cult classic Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels to deliver his most hard hitting, savagely funny and effortlessly stylish film to date - Snatch.

12 August 2013,planktonrules,9," Good, but it's not a film for most folks....
","My summary sounds a bit vague, so let me explain. ""Snatch."" is a very, very, very bloody and violent film. It also has a lot of very rough language and a bit of nudity. So, it's obviously not a film you show your kids, your mother-in-law or Father Jenkins!! This isn't as much a complaint as an observation--one you really should heed before you try watching the film. I just can't see most folks gravitating to a movie like this one, though if you do, it IS incredibly unique and well made.",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,dasa108,9," A work of art
","This film is masterfully produced, filmed, edited and scored. The casting is magnificent, the story is interesting because the very process of telling it is charming, captivating. It is a visual and aural enjoyment. It is one of those films born to be a classic and survive the years. They all act well, all the characters are believable, they all seem to enjoy their work. In short, a great movie in every way.",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2006,lee_eisenberg,10," Surely someone can understand Brad Pitt's accent...
","If you thought that Guy Ritchie's first movie was whacked-out, then get a load of this! ""Snatch."" has a rather convoluted plot, but the pace makes it worthwhile. Focusing on several groups of criminals trying to capture a diamond, it's basically a series of crazy situations. The weirdest (by which I mean ""coolest"") aspect is of course Brad Pitt's incomprehensible accent. But the other characters also have their own things to reveal about themselves.",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2020,Majikat76,9," 20 years on and still a great watch!
","A film I revisit at least once a year, the intertwining stories, the hierarchy of criminals, the simplistic, dark, comical dialogue and recognisable faces, make this a true Brit classic!",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2020,h-28658,8," Snatch is just a fun ride all around.
","Its filled with plenty of hilarious British dark humor. The story is interesting and is filled with many great and memorable characters. Guy Ritchie's directing is amazing here. Just like The Gentlemen , this movie is full of energy and great camera work.",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2010,jon-larsen,10," My stomach hurts! It literally hurts!
","Last year I was working on the IMDb Top 250 list, and I noticed that Snatch was on the list, so I decided to take a look at it. I was in Denmark at that time. I live in Faroe Islands.",/review/rw2352849/?ref_=tt_urv
