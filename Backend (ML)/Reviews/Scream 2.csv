29 September 2010,Tactrix,10," Case Closed!
","This series looks like a plain ol' cop drama from the outside but that couldn't be any further from the truth. Deputy Chief Brenda Lee Johnson is the head of a elite detective unit that solves homicides, now here are a few things you should probably know. First this chief has been trained how to interrogate by the C.I.A, secondly her entire squad is made up of detectives(that's right no rookies here), and of course her Husband is an F.B.I. Agent. Still need more? The way that this woman gets the job done is both masterful and incredible, on top of which she controls an entire unit full of men like a school teacher does in a classroom.

","The crime aspect of this show is pretty good, but not extraordinary. This should NOT be the reason to watch the show. If you're looking for that, look somewhere else.",/review/rw1143814/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2006,rogue719,9," Wonderfully character driven laughs and drama
","An outstanding drama that dances on the edge of being a formula cop show and a soap opera. Brenda Lee Johnson is an outstanding interrogator with a background of being difficult to work with but achieving great results. However, her personal life is a mess. She is hired from Atlanta to head LAPD's Priority Crimes Unit for those high profile crimes that need a resolution and need it quickly. Tensions arise immediately. Her brusque style makes her own people want to transfer away, her boss is a former lover who dumped her and she manages to make many more enemies than friends. The crimes are formula enough that you can probably figure out whodunit before you get to the climax but it's the characters and relationships that sell the show and make it worth watching. Not only is Kyra Sedgwick giving the performance of her life in this series but she has a terrific supporting cast that gives the series heart. The ability of the writers to also give us some great comic lines keeps the show teetering at times from comedy to drama. The first season is already out on DVD. Watch it from the first episode to the last, in order, and you can see why this show has become the most watched show in basic cable history.",/review/rw1143814/?ref_=tt_urv

","After watching every episode of ""The Closer"" up to the current one (final episode Sept. 2007), I feel it's time for me to commend every aspect of this series about an elite homicide squad.",/review/rw1143814/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2008,bkoganbing,9," Brenda Lee's Crack Squad Of Detectives
","The only problem I've ever had with The Closer is the whole concept of a Priority Homicide Squad. Just what constitutes a priority homicide, as distinct from your garden variety one? The answer as the LAPD brutally admits is one that has or is guaranteed to give them bad publicity if it don't get solved. ",/review/rw1143814/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2016,ma-cortes,7," Kyra Sedgwick gives a sensational acting as the stubborn Detective who runs the Priority Homicide Division of the LAPD
","Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson (who often thinks rules don't apply to her and was brought in by Assistant Chief Will Pope/J.K.Simmons , her former boss in the Metropolitan Police Department of Washington D.C., with whom she had an affair) as the head of the Priority Homicide Division of the LAPD , which was created to focus on high profile cases . Brenda runs the Priority Homicide Division of the LAPD with an unorthodox style , she is a well trained interrogator and has a great innate ability to get confessions and to read people resolving the city's toughest , most difficult , hardest cases . Later on , there appears Sharon Raydor well played by Mary McDonnell introduced to the Priority Homicide Division universe as the Captain of the Force Investigation Division , taking over the renamed PHD , which looks into officer-involved shootings , including one involving Detective David Gabriel/Corey Reynolds . It is a subdivision of Internal Affairs bound by federal oversight and is unpopular among LAPD personnel . She and Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson are initially antagonistic , although each is very dedicated to her job and believes in following the truth . Subsequently Raynor commands ¨Major Crimes¨ , a spin-off to ¨The Closer¨. Each series of ""The Closer"" has a theme on which its episodes are based. For Season 1, the theme is a woman in a man's world , the followings about partnerships , family , upon a meditation on power , the changing , and adjustment. ",/review/rw1143814/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2012,udarmohit,8," brilliant acting......
","The Closer is a show which has a fairly realistic portrayal of a working environment; there are relationship dynamics which have evolved over the several seasons and which explore the inter-personal connections made between co-workers as they solve cases. From the beginning episodes where Brenda's staff worked against her, sometimes with the expressed desire for her to fail, to the latest season where they appear to be firmly on her ""side"" there is an interesting dynamic in showing an intelligent and capable woman as authority-figure and the gradual and sometimes reluctant acceptance of her as the officers she works with see for themselves what she is bringing to the dept.",/review/rw1143814/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2005,MacLovesMoon,," 2005's Newest and BEST drama
","Sure, this could fall into the category with the other Law and Orders and CSI's but something about this show really stands out probably because its aired on TNT and you'd expect there to be some cheesy movie of the week quality about it. Like Law and Order the show puts more focus on the cases themselves rather than the personal lives of the characters, but The Closer opens the door a little more. Kyra is really what draws in people to this show, it's something about her character's charm despite the fact the character is from the often ridiculed south. The writers were also keen to make Brenda Johnson a real person, not some super-hero who always wins and always knows the every move of the bad guy; sometimes Brenda makes mistakes and pays for them and sometimes she is insecure about her looks or being freshly relocated to the big city of Los Angelos. The show just started this summer and I wish it the best of luck, I hope it can become as acclaimed as all the other crime dramas we've got on the airwaves today",/review/rw1143814/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2007,blanbrn,9," Great work from Kyra Sedgwick. A very entertaining and interesting cop drama.
","TNT has found a real winner in the cable TV series world with this series which continues to do well now three seasons in. ""The Closer"" is full of drama, love, passion, intrigue, humor, and seriousness. Kyra Sedgwick is great as Brenda Johnoson a real true southern belle from Atlanta, GA with both charm, wit, grace, and intelligence who starts a new life in Los Angeles as a chief deputy detective. Each episode Brenda always is very tough on each crime and murder case she works she's tough as nails in the interview asking tough questions to suspects. Brenda also is very witty and smart when looking for clues upon the crime scene her investigative work is hands on, but underneath it all she never losses her southern charm and nice gentle ways. Her love life is off and on but sometimes romance with an FBI agent is shown. She's certainly a tough woman cracking L.A.'s most bloody and tough cases with hard work and determination, her habit is a bad sweet tooth! I just love the way Kyra speaks and portrays Brenda so well with a deep and thick southern drawl a real twang of talent! Really this series is good a tribute to police detectives and their hard work of crime solving skills, even better it's nice to see the fine Kyra Sedgwick doing a role so well a real role model to every working woman!",/review/rw1143814/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2006,bunnylew,10," Great new exciting show.
","I am loving this series and it is the only show on TV right now that I really hate to miss. Brenda Lee Johnson is such a refreshing character. She has some slight skeletons in her closet, but has moved on to her new job and is getting it done with intense efforts, despite some members of her team being less than welcoming. Her love interest is hot and I certainly hope this continues and heats up during this second season. Fritz, I hope, will have a stronger part in this season and their relationship will heat up. He is very caring and thoughtful and hopefully Brenda will appreciate him and not mess this up. I would love to see their relationship be portrayed as healthy and happy--not like all the other junk on TV. I bought the First Season DVD set and haven't gotten tired of watching them. All of the plots have been suspenseful and interesting--the twists are super. Good writing--hope it lasts.",/review/rw1143814/?ref_=tt_urv

21 September 2005,danadavis67867,," Great show
","I didn't see the first episode of this series, but from the first time I watched it I could tell it would be one of my favorite shows. And I wasn't disappointed. There are so many things I love about this show, but most of all it is hilarious to watch the characters interact with each other. Kyra Sedgwick excellently portrays a tough woman who won't let people walk all over her. People complain that Brenda is a b****, but maybe that's the point. What fun would it be to watch a show with nothing but sweetness and joy between the main characters, no conflict whatsoever? The tension she endures and often causes just makes the show all the more entertaining.",/review/rw1143814/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2005,gbaker-7,," As a professional woman, I *love* this show
","And as a professional woman, why was I surprised by the nasty comments about the lead character? One poster missed the point entirely when he wrote that all of the detectives working for her submitted their resignations after the first meeting because she was a real bitch. They submitted their requests for transfer BEFORE EVEN MEETING HER. Under the circumstances, her behavior was pretty restrained. How I wish I could think up some of the responses she comes up with -- and had the guts to utter them!",/review/rw1143814/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2012,kayaker36,6," HOW does she do it?
","At just about 45 minutes into each episode, Brenda Leigh suddenly and brilliantly solves the case, the murderer being always the least likely suspect. The culprit is soon blurting out his, or rarely her confession, by then either stammering some pathetic self-justification to the Dep. Chief's stern and unforgiving gaze or simply reduced to tears.",/review/rw1143814/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2021,dirtphelia,2," Not believable. Horrible writing! Dislikable main character. *SPOILERS*
","The writing is really bad. Conversations are made unnatural in order to create problems and drama. Brenda, the main character, shows up at people's homes or workplaces and starts asking them all sorts of questions without telling them who she is, then gets aggressive with people when they get defensive and don't immediately answer her and do what she tells them to. One example that really annoyed me: one suspect asks to see his brother and, instead of saying, ""I'm sorry, that's not possible, he's dead,"" Brenda goes, ""That's impossible!"" Nobody talks like that!",/review/rw1143814/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2009,morganshs99,10," Love this show!
","A recent episode called ""Maternal Instincts"" was such a tear-jerker. Brenda really showed her true colors - a caring and compassionate person. Maybe the writers wanted to show how she has grown over the years from a rather self-centered person to someone who could actually be a mother. It was a brilliant piece of acting and writing for the entire cast.",/review/rw1143814/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2020,gary-64659,10," A lousy 7.6?
","This overall series score of 7.6 is about the right rating for ""Major Crimes"", its spin-off series. But ""The Closer"" with its brilliantly subtle writing, directing and acting for an adult audience outdoes it in every department. Amazed and dismayed that this series only equals the rating of its much lesser follow-up. It should be somewhere around the 9s.",/review/rw1143814/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2005,Linz48,," the Closer is the BEST TV Series to hit late night TV since Law and Order
","Dear TNT, I absolutely love Kyra Sedgwick. This part was made for her. I actually find myself laughing every time she ends her sentence with that little sarcastic ""Thank You, thank ya-ll very much"". She's adorable. It was great to see G.W Bailey cast as one of the cops. He is a terrific actor and is never given enough credit. He is very amusing as this character. I plan my Monday nights around THE CLOSER. I had recently seen an advertisement indicating that the series is only for the summer!!! Why would any network reel in an audience only to cut them off in September. This is a HIT series !!!!. Why is TNT not going forward with this fabulous show. And, most importantly, what am I going to do on Monday nights if this show ends.!!!! Please have someone re-consider keeping this show on the air. There are those of us out there who are educated and appreciate good TV: CSI, NYPD, Law and Order and THE CLOSER!!! We are sick of these mindless reality series, only made for idiots. Sincerely, Chris Lindsay R.N.C. in Poughkeepsie, NY",/review/rw1143814/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2009,sjb_can,10," Crime Drama With Heart
","Chief Deputy Brenda Lee Johnson, along with her co-workers, family, victims and suspects are combined in story lines dramatically different from the popular CSI, Law and Order and copycats. Personally, I'm over-saturated with stories ""ripped from the headlines"", grisly autopsies and cool cool cinematography. The Closer entertains. While the plots may not always be completely believable, the characters act like real people. If you like character driven stories, this is a show worth exploring. I've read complaints that there's not much mystery in the show. I agree, but it doesn't matter. That's not the intent. There was very little mystery in Columbo either and it was the most entertaining show of its time. And there's complaints about Brenda Lee's messy personal life. For me, it makes her fully dimensional and complex. She has a lot of foibles and she is definitely ""impossible"" as she readily admits, but her work is brilliant, inspired and she's a fierce force of justice. Her over the top southern accent adds a sweetness that is endearing once one grows accustomed to it. Her problems with her fiancé and parents may be a bit exaggerated and contrived at times, but Kyra Sedgwick carries Brenda Lee's life into the viewer's heart in such a way that any flaws are easily overlooked. The supporting cast is superb. I wouldn't change a thing.",/review/rw1143814/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2022,djrunngren,5," Brenda Lee Annoying
","I'm only about half way through the series. But I don't know if I can finish. Brenda could very well be the most annoying character on TV. Yes she is a great detective, but I don't think I can take her anymore. I like the other detectives too. She does whatever she wants and no one seems to do anything about it. I'll try a few more episodes, but I don't think I'll make it to the end.",/review/rw1143814/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2005,Luvjoy1948-1,," The Closer
",The Closer is one of the best new shows on television today. Kyra Sedgwick does an outstanding job. She shows that women can handle themselves in the law enforcement industry. She has a tough time fitting in with the male members of her team because she is so much brighter and more insightful then they are. I also feel they are rather intimidated by her actions. She is able to get more information from the law breakers then the men can. I believe she makes the show what it is. She is an amazing actress. I am also a fan of all the Law and Order shows. I feel this one is up to the same standards as those as are the CSI shows. I think this show should continue and will rank close with the other law and order shows. Give this show a chance and it will surprise you. I am glad the network took the chance with this new show because it shows that they looked beyond the negativity that some viewers might have with shows like this one.,/review/rw1143814/?ref_=tt_urv
