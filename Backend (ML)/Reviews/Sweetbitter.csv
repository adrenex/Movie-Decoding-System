17 June 2022,thejdrage,7," Haters gonna hate. It's a slapstick comedy.
","I love Melissa McCarthy and I appreciate her husband, Ben Falcone. BTW - he can sing! AND don't forget our favorite Gilmore Girls Frenchman, Yanic Truesdale (really a French Canadian).",/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,star_hazard,5," Premise is nice but it just didn't hit
",I get the appeal of this. The concept seems fun and it's light hearted. The characters don't pop out as like overly annoying to me. But the overall delivery for me was just quite bland. It just didn't hit the notes. Sometimes I feel like oh yeah this scene is funny but then they stretch it out and it just loses the appeal of it...so before I even go ha ha it just dies.,/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,digitalbrian,10," Great
","I wish people who do not like McCarthy would just stop watching, some of us think she is the best thing since grandmas knickers on a BBQ. This is a very specific kind of humor and some people just dont like that.",/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,anielsen-45670,8," A cute treat
","Very cute show, made me laugh a lot. Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone work great together. It's a very fun show and keeps you hooked right from the beginning. A very warm hearted show.",/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2022,g_uzman,10," Loved!
",We loved this and were sad when we watched the last episode and realized there weren't any more. I really don't understand all of the low ratings as hubby and I enjoyed this so much. I am rating this a 10 to try and boost the rating score. So many hilarious moments and we really fell in love with every character especially Frisbee. Hope we get to see more!,/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,kahast,9," Cute and funny!
",This show runs a bit slow but it's very sweet and gets better after the first couple of episodes of you give the characters a chance to grow on you. I look forward to the good guys winning!,/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2022,Blhhas2,9," Enjoyable
",I ignored all the IMBD review snobs and watched for myself. I really found this show to be original and fun. I think it was exactly what I expected this type of show to be.,/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2022,fandomfatale,9," Great characters
","I am a fan of Melissa McCarthy and really enjoyed her in this. I also really enjoyed all of the supporting characters a lot. I thought they were all very original and wonderfully likable. I especially liked Tom ad his development. I wish they were my coworkers! I think that is the strength of the show, but I found it funny and uplifting as well. I consider my time to have been well-spent and I hope there is a second season.",/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2022,cockezville,3," Oh No!
",Why does Melissa McCarthy continue to work with her husband in dismal material. She is so talented but this mess will continue to end a career. This is just not funny.,/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2022,laqsheyo,6," God's favourite sitcom?
","To be honest, I didn't liked the trailer of this show so had no expectations, but I just watched the 1st episode and it feels like a cool sitcom with likeable characters, some romantic tension, office comedy and a good storyline. Don't expect much from this show till now it's above average and easily watchable.",/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2022,ricoswivee,10," Stop the hate! It's a comedy, people!
","""Get off you're phone, you're not that interesting!"" Pretty sure these two could make watching your neighbors dog take a poop on your lawn funny. Not the best comedy ever, but definitely funny for people who have a sense of humor and folks who have evolved past posting bad reviews when they admit they ""only watched a few minutes"" of a movie. Think about that for a minute. Of course, if you're too uppity to enjoy this kind of thing, well...ðŸ™„ bless your heart. Haters gonna hate. ðŸ˜‰",/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2022,allnitediner,10," Critics ruin the fun for all of us. This show is a gem.
","I'm so worried this will get cancelled because critics don't understand what's funny because they're snobs whose opinions don't matter more than anyone else's. I laughed out loud by myself about ten times and the first episode had only been on for eleven minutes. Then I watched all of the episodes and now I'd like another season, please.",/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,pk-99172-97176,6," Not half bad once you get through half of it.
","I really hated this through the first four episodes. And I considered quitting it altogether, however I began to warm up to the storyline and its characters. Leslie Bibb's Satan is a riot and I loved the depiction of God as a grandmotherly nurse. Furthermore, its message that all faiths are equally right is refreshing considering how polarized the actual world feels. For that I give this a strong 6.",/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2022,AristarchosTheArchivist,8," Cute and very underrated. Not for cynics and psychopaths.
","It is pretty easy: If you rate this one low, you have no heart.",/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2022,ladylapel,10," Ignore the reviews below that barely even watched it
","Please ignore the useless reviews below that are trying to base a whole series on 10 minutes of watching it. Seriously, this is nothing new, some shows take a few episodes to build the plot, it does get a whole lot better and there is a point behind all the madness, crudeness, and ridiculousness in the beginning which wasn't that bad. I like it, it has a good message to deliver. And some really funny parts. It's nice to have something decent and easy to watch for a change. I really like all the characters, the actors are pretty good. I can't wait for more episodes. I like that they work together and can still have great chemistry, after so long and spending so much time together. To see 2 people genuinely enjoy each other's company is utterly refreshing. All the craziness you see in the beginning, is toned down as the episodes go along. So just give it a real chance. Don't be the reason why another good show gets canceled only for 2 or 3 years later people actually take the time to watch it and love it and wonder why it was ever canceled and start requesting that it gets another season.",/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2022,Chris_Ego,1," another cringe production by Falcone/McCarthy
",After several attempts to watch the productions of the married couple I again have to ask: why does this BS get greenlighted?,/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2022,zac-68274,1," Luv McCarthy But The Entire Script Is Deplorable!
",Even Melissa McCarthy couldn't save this fiery crash of a series. Someone tried too hard with each character boring the viewer to sleep waiting for any sign of sensible comedic Relief!,/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,danieljhill-34211,9," Funny and entertaining
",Really enjoyable if you give it a chance. I laughed through every episode. It looks like the cast had great fun filming too. Makes me wish I was part of the crew.,/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,JustinSookram,8," Sure why not I like it so far
",It's decent it goes back and forth through two different perspectives with the two main characters. Its interesting I feel like they are trying another approach to comedy.,/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2022,scottzanarky,5," Not a bad show to watch if you have a few hours
","Honestly, with the short episode and season length, it's worth it just to watch for some decent laughs.",/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2022,WatchAndSmile,10," 10/10 Great TV show
","I can't wait for season 2. If you like humor, dry, dark humor and willing to laugh at yourself, your ideals hangs up then you can handle this TV show. It makes some fun at religion and other things and all the bad reviewers don't like it as they only like to enjoy laughing at other's expense. Majority of bad reviewers only watched 1 episode. Not nice...
I am religious, I shake my head and smile. This is what this show was created for - to give you all a smile. If you don't like it, move over, go watch something else. Great show, nice cast. Please do the season 2!!!",/review/rw8241927/?ref_=tt_urv
