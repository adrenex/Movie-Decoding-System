29 March 2017,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,8," I actually really enjoyed this movie.
","Sure it's still got some of the dated gooey-ness of the original movie, sure Shrek's impact on savaging the Disney/fairy-tale formula can still be felt years after release, but Cinderella is a beautifully directed and cinematographed; and Kenneth Branagh did this?

15 March 2017,filipemanuelneto,8," Has the original version of the fairy tale gone out of style?
","This movie has been very poorly understood by the public. Unlike previous films, which seek to rewrite traditional fairy tales or watch them from new perspectives (""Maleficent"", ""Ever After"", or even the animations ""Brave"" or ""Tangled""), this film is the live-action version of the fairy tale in its more traditional version. Therefore, we know the whole story and very little has been changed or added. Any problem? Not for me. I usually like original versions more than any contemporary re-interpretations, but it seems that fairy tales have gone out of style.",/review/rw7327428/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2019,andrewchristianjr,8," LILY JAMES WAS AWESOME!
","First of all, Lily James was awesome! Wicked Cate Blanchet damn. Probably one of the best adaptation of disney classic.",/review/rw7327428/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2021,bheadher,10," An enchanting twist on the original...
","Frankly this movie was far better than the new musical version...I happened on this over half way through while channel surfing, and the surfing came to a screeching halt as I watched it only for a minute that turned into the final credits...it was enough to get me thinking of the first Disney epic from my childhood. I just cannot utter enough glowing praise for this outing of Cinderella really, it is that good. It follows the original story, yet with something of an updated modern theme...the acting is solid and the CGI for the coach and animals is superb...",/review/rw7327428/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2017,snperera,8," great film!
","Love this film! no it is not like the original but it is great in it's own way! The prince is more developed as a character, the step-mother is still great, and Cinderella is great too. I think this Cinderella is more quiet and with that a quiet beauty and strength comes through her and it really shines. I love this movie and I will always love to watch this one and the original one.",/review/rw7327428/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2019,jml1988,7," Beautiful portrayal
","This was well casted and I loved the visual effects of it. The infamous transformation was perfection. I wished there was more Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter) as she was expectedly fabulous, but her part was disappointingly short.",/review/rw7327428/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2021,gfrasmd,10," Should admire Kenneth Branagh artistic sensibility and courage.
","It is an enormous task to retell a story, a gentle fairy tale, at that, that has been re-proposed zillion times. The typical Hollywood approach, in the effort of being different, has educated the audience to expecting an increasing dose of violence, crudity, gore and perversions at every remake.",/review/rw7327428/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2020,j-00900,7," A beautiful fairy tale
","The story is still an old story, beautifully dreamy, fashion design and art director praise, Cinderella transformation and dancing two scenes are too beautiful. Blanchett really steals the show, Lily James is also quite cute, Helena has less drama, but what other fairy godmother is as interesting as her.",/review/rw7327428/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2021,svipul-18788,10," Far bette than the 2021 remake
",Watch this movie instead of the 2021 one because that one had a horrible cast and the music was bad. This movie although isn't perfect but is great to watch.,/review/rw7327428/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2020,shakthi-82794,8," A perfect remake of the original
",I don't understand what people expect out a Disney remake of Cinderella. The movie sticks to the story and core ideas of the original. Cinderella was written has a fairytale story and that's exactly what the movie conveys. THIS IS A PERFECT MODERN REMAKE OF THE CLASSIC FAIRYTALE STORY CINDERELLA. And I absolutely enjoyed it.,/review/rw7327428/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2019,nogodnomasters,10," HAVE COURAGE AND BE KIND
",The movie gives us some background information on Cinderella (Lily James). We get to meet her real parents before their expected deaths. We also see her privileged life and education prior to living with the cartoonish step-sisters and overly evil step mother (Cate Blanchett) who enters the film with her own ominous sound track.,/review/rw7327428/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2018,StregaAsuka,7," Bibidi Babibi Boo !!
","Not my favourite Disney cartoon pic but I liked this version much more, it's more real, cause we all know that animals don't talk! LOL! Yes, we all know the story by heart and if you had a childhood I bet you've seen the 1950's cartoon version, so you shall watch this one too.",/review/rw7327428/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2022,nitro72,7," Unapologetically Sincere
","Non-musical elaboration of the familiar fairy tale is (at times) teeth-achingly sweet, while remaining unapologetically sincere, warm, & fun. Blanchett chews just the right amount of scenery & James is pure innocence personified. #nitrosMovieChallenge.",/review/rw7327428/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2016,cecilecanonigo,10," Magical!
","This movie is just magical! The message of the movie genuinely touched my heart and spirit, it was breathtakingly gorgeous! The colors, the cinematography, the costumes just wow and love the music! The only thing i would change is i would love it more if there's singing..Lily James have a very sweet mezzo soprano voice i love her singing ""A Dream is a Wish"" at the end of the movie. And yes The acting was so good i cried like so many times..my fave was Prince Kit and the King's scene,Lily crying when her dress was ripped and the first dance oh god it was magic! and the gown transformation was so epic! The lead actors chemistry is so strong.. i fell in love with them. This movie is so uplifting makes me do kind deeds every time! People saying it was boring have a heart of stone for real. This is Amazing and i can't wait for Beauty and The Beast.. Well done Disney!ðŸ’™ðŸ˜˜ðŸ’‹",/review/rw7327428/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2016,seannasuti,10," A quite beautiful adaptation of a Disney classic
","Right now Disney's current trend with their live-action films has been a series of live-action re-imaginings of their animated classics. Obviously this has proved to be a rather polarizing tactic amongst certain fans, namely because they believe that these are intended to replace the original films. Well I can assure you that this ain't the intention. You see the internet has this mentality about remakes that they're supposed to replace the original when that's not the case. Hell, even if they don't end up being very good, the original is not tainted in any way. And that's been the case with Disney's live- action remakes, even the ones that haven't been well-received like the 'Alice' films and 'Maleficent'.",/review/rw7327428/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2021,rayres0708,10," A wonderful retelling

31 January 2022,AscendeSuperius,7," A beautiful timeless classic
","I believe its fair to say that when referring to the classic princess fairytale films, there's only one metric you need to measure, is it swoon worthy? And boy does this one do the trick. A world where good will always prevail, where one only marries for love, what's not to love?",/review/rw7327428/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2017,dforster,9," Stepmother portrayed with modern depth
","Although this is about the stepmother, I want to first say that I found all the characters well portrayed and supported by an excellent script, cinematography, and of course a great director. I scanned some of the user reviews and for all those giving a very low rating it seems to me that they missed the essence of Cinderella - it is not supposed to be an action nor hard/boiled tale that apparently even some children want today and should not become such.",/review/rw7327428/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2020,Chanandler-Bong,8," Magical
","Without thinking too much about the animated original, this film was truly magical. Cinderella was never a favourite of mine, but this new version certainly is. The step-mother was given depth and background to her character. All the acting was brilliant. The story had emotion and had me in tears a number of times. It was just sweet and beautiful. Warmed my heart.",/review/rw7327428/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2021,elyrov,9," very beautiful film
","I saw this film yesterday with my family and I have to say that it was magical. I thought that it could be boring because the story of Cinderella is always the same, but even though the story was basically identical to the original one we really enjoyed it and we loved spending time together watching this film.",/review/rw7327428/?ref_=tt_urv
