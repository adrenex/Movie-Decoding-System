28 March 2010,howard.schumann,8," Humorous, heartwarming, and satisfying
","In the fact-based film The Blind Side, a burly homeless black teenager Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) is taken in by the family of Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), a spunky white Christian mother of two and assisted through school until he achieves success as a football player in high school and college, eventually being drafted in the first round by the professional Baltimore Ravens. The film, written and directed by John Lee Hancock and adapted from a book by Michael Lewis, is undemanding entertainment that lacks a great deal of subtlety but is continuously entertaining and emotionally involving and redefines the true meaning of family values.",/review/rw2353068/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2010,itszombietime,5," I can see why Michael Oher was unhappy with this film
","First of all, Quinton did a fine job in the lead role. Let's get that out of the way. Great acting job. He took the material he was given and played the role very well.",/review/rw2353068/?ref_=tt_urv

21 November 2009,momomomomo,8," Better than I thought
","I've been reading lot of horrible comments that are based solely on the issues surrounding the movie rather than the movie itself. I wasn't excited to see this movie, I'm not interested in sports at all. The movie kept my attention though and well. It moved along quickly and pulled me into the story and left me feeling inspired. I wasn't excited to see a blonde sandy bullock in a sports movie, I think that's what might have turned me off the most, but she did really good job! It's rare to see a movie where there's a really strong lead female character. Whether you like Leigh Anne Touhy or not in the end, she is certainly entertaining and Sandra Bullock does a great job of bringing her onto the screen. The youngest son did an amazing job! So much talent in him. The character of Mike I think could have used a few more lines, even if he's supposed to be shy and reserved. All the actors really did a great job though for the most part. No it's not an epic Oscar winning film, although I wouldn't be surprised if Bullock got nominated for something for her acting. It is NOT loaded with propaganda as the other reviews might suggest. It's a light entertaining pick me up film that would be an excellent choice to bring the family to, most likely the reason why they released it over the Holidays.",/review/rw2353068/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2009,J_Trex,10," Bullock's Masterpiece
","I don't think I've seen a Bullock movie since ""Speed"" that didn't leave me watching my cell phone for the time. Her movies have been pretty awful and worth skipping. Not this one. The story received a lot of press and one has to give her much credit for snapping up the rights to it. She also did a fabulous job as the heroine. I was simply amazed. It was really one of the most amazing career rehabilitations since Travolta in ""Pulp Fiction"".",/review/rw2353068/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2014,Visitor_C,2," Whose Story is it Anyway?
","Time to complain about a film that would rather take away then include an important aspect of a true story. When watching the film, one should say this story is about Michael Oher, a man who, with the help of a supportive, slightly wealthy family, was able to overcome his hardships of homelessness and loneliness through perseverance and friendship. But the reality of this film is far from that description. It is more about the stupid sport of football and the rich family taking in Michael. I felt that the film did not put enough into the character of Michael Oher, they instead took away from him. I can see the potential of the character, but the story of the film limits him of almost everything except for being a mindless brute on a field. I know for a fact that the real life Michael Oher is nothing like this, nor ever really was. This film was to shine on the rich family, and the goodness they implanted on the world. In a way, it was selfish to put them above Michael in his own story. Sure Sandra has good acting qualities, but that should not be the basis of the film. Anyway, it was still a movie of an intermediate standard. It lacks in many departments, but the worst is the conversion from the novel to the film. If they had focused more on Michael and not the family, then maybe it would have been a better flick, but alas.",/review/rw2353068/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2009,jeremyscates,10," Very well done!
","I don't usually feel the need to leave comments, but this movie was just to well done not to. I went in expecting more football, more hits & highlights & as a huge football fan that was one of the main draws of the movie. The football actually takes a back seat to a wonderful story that is well executed by everyone involved. I've always thought Sandra Bulluck has been over-rated, but she nails this role & deserves some recognition down the road. The movie is so fantastic that anyone and everyone can relate and feel connected to the characters. The ideal target audience for this movie is children and adults alike. This movie should be an Oscar contender but I know these types of movies rarely ever win. Definitely deserves my vote!",/review/rw2353068/?ref_=tt_urv

15 November 2009,Chris-538,7," My take on the Michael Oher story
","I'm a sports snob. I strongly believe there's only a handful of truly great sports movies. It's just too difficult for filmmakers to recreate the drama that takes place on the field. So when the Creative Loafers at sportschump.net asked me to review The Blind Side, a sports movie I would never see,starring an actress I really don't like, I was skeptical. But they promised me Jujubees, so I agreed to attend the premiere.",/review/rw2353068/?ref_=tt_urv

4 June 2010,claudio_carvalho,9," Wonderful Heartwarming True Story
","In Memphis, when Coach Burt Cotton (Ray McKinnon) sees the athletic potential of the homeless Afro-American teenager Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), he convinces the other teachers of the Wingate Christian School to accept his application. However, the outcast Michael has serious trauma with his abused childhood and his grades are not enough to join the Crusaders football team of the school.

1 November 2009,tinanwoods,8," Skillful, compassionate and dignified portrayal of an amazing, true personal drama
","I have just returned from seeing the blind side. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie, particularly it's more poignant moments. Yes, this is a sports story, yes this is a biopic, but it is also in large part an interpersonal drama. It is rare to see a movie these days that relies on drama to carry it-not special effects, lush historically accurate wardrobe, or astounding make up- just a story that resonates with the viewer. That this story is based on contemporary facts makes it all the more resonant. Events that might have been handled superficially, predictably or exploited for dramatic purposes were instead presented in a nuanced and profound manner. Michael's biological mother was portrayed with dignity and compassion. In short, the aspects of Michael's story that make it moving and inspiring were captured with skill and integrity. As for the negative feedback regarding this movie that began when the only the trailers were available - I think the comments might be more a reflection of the world view of the authors rather than a reflection of the quality of the movie or the reality of Michael's story. Some people think the movie ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was a story about racism in the south, or that ""The Crying Game"" was a movie about the IRA - to me those were the settings for the drama, and not the drama itself. John Lee Hancock really bit off a lot when he took on this project-but as it turned out, it was not more than he could chew. Remember when Attorney General Eric Holder commented on how we were a nation of cowards when it came to openly discussing race? With this movie, Hancock has demonstrated he is not one of those cowards. He did not ignore the racial or class differences of the characters in this movie, and he avoided using the movie to make a social statement with the movie. He allowed these character attributes to be what they were in reality, and told the human drama in an effective and sensitive manner.",/review/rw2353068/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," love this movie highly recommend
","Sandra Bullock is rapid and compelling in this true story of tragedy-turned-triumph. The Blind Side is an enjoyable that some may consider a bit too soft or safe. Though it won't completely win moviegoers over, they'll still be in awe of the bold lead actress.",/review/rw2353068/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2010,Quinoa1984,5," nothing to really get too worked up about - not even Bullock can elevate it past its 'safe' quarters
","I'm sure Michael Oher is an inspiring sort of story. In fact his real story, the one glossed over in the film version The Blind Side, is kind of fascinating (unlike in the film, Oher was taken by several families over the years, some black, until winding up with the Twohey's as seen here). That he could make a difference, if only for himself, is a fine feat. But there's something about the movie that is sanitized, kept in the Hollywood bakery to make it fresh for a G-rated mass consumption. It's not even offensive to any great degree, except for the fact that the filmmakers relegate the main character to a secondary kind of role (rather, if he does have any real personality in real life, it's whittled down to make him a cypher, a character that does what he's told and never questions anything - not even why he becomes a football star).",/review/rw2353068/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2015,bkoganbing,7," A helping hand
",The Blind Side is a most inspiring film about Michael Oher a gentle giant of a kid who's not gotten too many breaks in life.

8 December 2009,thesubstream,4," Who knows if that guy even wanted to play football?!
","There's a word that I learned listening to smart people talk about issues and subtext and social justice and post-modernism: ""problematic"". When a person has a problem with something like a video game or capitalism or the way coffee gets to my house, when they think it's bad or wrong or unfair but don't actually have a solution or better, correct, more fair idea in mind, things are ""problematic"".

","This is a dumbed down excuse of a movie. Honestly, I felt a physical assault on my brain cells.

23 July 2011,MovieGuy109,6," The Blind Side's motivational, yet no character study.
","The inspirational story of Michael Oher, the performance from Sandra Bullock, and the good camera work, so why did it not come together? I think the blame is on the screenplay. The overall portrayal of Michael Oher seems stylized in a way that never really shows the true grit or sentiment of the character. It is all so glamored up. Yet the messages of the movie still stay true and the performances are finely tuned, especially Bullock's. The racism displayed is reflective and correct. Ther are lots of things the filmmakers got right, but there are plenty they got wrong as well. The results are a serviceable portrait of a very honest and fortunate man that never adds up the way it should have.",/review/rw2353068/?ref_=tt_urv

12 June 2010,FilmRap,6," A feel good movie- but no way did it deserve to be one of the top 10 of 2009
","A few months after the Academy Awards we decided to see this movie since it was nominated as one of the 10 best pictures of year and of course Sandra Bullock was named Best Actress. While it was a good performance by Bullock who had a fine southern accent for her character, we decided that she probably was given the Oscar for ""her body of work"". The movie was a predictable ""feel good"" story that in our opinion was not in the same league as the other nominees for best picture. It is based on a true story of Michael Oher, an over-sized black teenager from the wrong side of the tracks ( Quinton Aaron), who gets ""adopted"" by a rich Memphis couple ( Sandra Bullock and country music star Tim McGraw) with two kids of their own. The school football coach drools over his potential as a offensive lineman but it is not until his new Mother knowing that he has tested to have high aptitude in the ""protectiveness"" scale encourages him to ""protect"" the quarterback or the running back as he would protect his own new found family does he show his stuff. He now is able to use his size and power and become a great football player who is recruited by many colleges including his new parents alma mater ""Ole Miss"". In order to play football and stay in the game he had to be tutored by a teacher who also went to Ole Missplayed by Kathy Bates. There are a few mild twists and subplots in the story line but no big surprises. You come away from the movie with a warm feeling, especially as you look at the closing credits interspersed with photos of the real Michael Oher and the family that adopted him, as well as confirmation that he eventually made the NFL.",/review/rw2353068/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2009,dbutrfli,," Fantastic, heartwarming, fun and emotional.
","I just saw The Blind Side last night. As I have read even if you are not a football fan you'll like this movie. I am not a football fan (baseball is my sport) but I loved it!!! So many great performances by the actors. A charming story with laughs and tears. How nice to have a positive movie this time of the year especially. Everybody MUST see this movie. Quinton Aaron does a fantastic job of playing Michael Oher. In the early scenes he has no dialog, but expresses so much just with is eyes and facial expressions. Jae Head is charming as the young ""brother"" S.J. Camped up I am sure, but I go to the movies to entertained which the movie does in spades! Sandra Bullock as I have never seen her before, does a wonderful job, so different that the other roles she has had in the past. And Ray McKinnon as the coach has some expressions that John Lee Hancock should be awarded for his direction.",/review/rw2353068/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've discovered that you certainly don't have to be black to be offended and insulted by the candy-coated fable ""The Blind Side"". As I watched I couldn't help but be reminded of ""Harry And The Hendersons"", but with a decidedly racist slant, although in the movie's defense, I don't feel it was deliberate. All the same, this feel-good movie is the type of Hollywood production that blacks have justifiably railed against since ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"", and rightfully so.",/review/rw2353068/?ref_=tt_urv
