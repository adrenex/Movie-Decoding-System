","A movie titled My Bloody Valentine is clearly non trying to pander to art house crowds, nor does it even seem to be reaching for a higher ilk in the horror genre, but while appearing as a fully tacky horror movie entry (a 3-D remake) My Bloody Valentine succeeds in avoiding and ultimately reviving the never ending pitfalls of such films; a strong, unique opening and a surprising and completely plausible, non-ridiculous finale.

","My Bloody Valentine 3D is one of those really rare kinds of horror flicks. It delivers buckets of gore, brisk pacing, and a lot of in your face 3D goodness. Sit close to the front of your theater for the maximum effect (if you dare!). There is brutality in king size portions, sure to satisfy the most hardcore of horror fans. They really pull out all the stops with that pickaxe's of his. ",/review/rw2044345/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a remake of a Canadian horror film that I grew up with and is still very dear to me. Even though I don't think they make great horror films these days, the 3D gimmick was too much to pass up. And it's nice to see that the original motivated someone to try and remake it. That said, this film is nothing extraordinary, but worth it if you have some time to kill. And be prepared to pay extra since this is a 3D film. They charged me an extra two bucks for the glasses. It isn't often you pay $9.50 for a movie at 3 in the afternoon, but what the hell.",/review/rw2044345/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a solid, decent bloody, fast-paced decent slasher from 2000's that delivers plenty of suspenseful action. It is not a better than original slasher 80's but it is a decent solid remake that I enjoy. I like this film. I love the setting which takes place in the mine shaft and in the forest on a Valentine's Day. This movie has gore, nudity (in which original didn't had nudity) and it is a fun thrill ride.",/review/rw2044345/?ref_=tt_urv

","I wanted to see My Bloody Valentine back in February on the big screen in its 3D version but eventually I could not. Not quite ago I saw its R1 DVD and I was very glad to find out that it included the 3D version but boy it was just too f****** expensive. So I decided to wait, the R4 DVD was released, it contained the 3D version as well and I finally bought it last weekend. I knew more or less what to expect of this remake of the 1981 Canadian My Bloody Valentine (for the record, I'm one of those who heard for the very first time about the 1981 My Bloody Valentine once its remake had already been released) and in a way I have not many complaints: the 2009 My Bloody Valentine (apparently the official title goes with the ""3D"" but in IMDb it is listed without it) is not clever stuff, it's an entertaining yet very forgettable movie with a cool-looking killer.

","In the mining town of Harmony, there is an accident caused by the son of the owner Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) during a drilling, and the mine collapses burying six miners alive. The rescue team finds only Harry Warden alive but in coma and the other miners murdered punched by his pickax, and they conclude that Harry killed them to save oxygen for himself. On the Valentine's Day, Harry awakes from the coma in the local hospital, and he kills twenty-two persons, including a group of teenagers that are partying in the mine. Harry is killed by the deputy but the only survivors are Tom Hanniger, his girlfriend Sarah (Jaime King), their friend Axel Palmer (Kerr Smith) and another girl. Ten years later, Tom returns to Harmony after the death of his father decided to sell the Hanniger Mine, and finds that Sarah has married Axel, now the local sheriff, and they have a son. On the Valentine's Day, Harry Warden also returns seeking revenge against those that had escaped from his pickax in the past, and Tom is accused by Axel and other locals.

14 February 2017,ironhorse_iv,5," Oh my! Oh my! This horror movie is bloody awful! Don't you dare, be my valentine!
","Much like in the original 1981 Canadian slasher film of the same name; this 2009 American 3D remake centered, around murders committed, near Valentine's Day, perpetuated by a psychopath in a miner's outfit. However, while this movie directed by Patrick Lussier seem like it was trying its own ideas, much the outline was just recycle sequences from the first movie. After all, the movie starts out the same with the methane gas explosion, but instead of having the psychopath blame the supervisors for abandoning them in the mine for a Valentine Day party; in the remake, they choose to have the miner go after the owner's son, Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles) for forgetting to vent the methane lines. Though a deleted scene does reveal, the killer was trapped while a Valentine's Day dance was being held. Still, because of this change, the focus on the gimmick of the killer sending real-life bloody hearts to his victims seems a bit, out of the blue. Why? Because, when I now, think about it, this remake barely has anything to do with Valentine Day, besides the triangle love story between Tom's best friend Axel Palmer (Kerr Smith), Axel's wife/ Tom's ex-girlfriend, Sarah (Jamie King) and himself. For the most part, the killer just killed random people that has nothing with the main plot, such as the pointless murderous rampage at the motel in the middle or the hospital in the beginning. Another problem with this movie is the awkward structure, it has. Its starts off in 1997, with too quick, over exposition newspaper clipping of the killer being trapped, that does give enough information to explain, why the miner acts the way, he does. Then, the film cut to a year later, with the killer, somehow waking up from his coma in the hospital, and having the strength to goes on a murderous rampage at a miner party that shouldn't had been there, and then, finally ten years later in 2008, when the ageless, Tom returns to reclaim his father's mine and confronting his friends who abandoned him in the mine with the killer. It's all over the place. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the movie is full of plot-holes, such as the grocery store scene and how the sheriff know about the killer being in the house, even the plot twist toward the end, doesn't make a lick of sense, when you think about it. After all, what ever happen to the miner's body in the end!? Another problem with this movie is the choice of acting. Everybody was dry and too serious. There was hardly any wit or charm. It's sad, because one of the actors, is normally enjoyable. After all, he come from a TV Show 'Supernatural' that had an episode (Season 5, 14th episode) that had the same title of this movie, and a similar plot. So, it was possible to make this movie, fun to watch. Instead, everybody felt mostly uniformly unsavory, obnoxious and unsympathetic. Because of this, I really wouldn't care, about their relationship or the character's well-beings. It really took me, out of the movie. Another thing that sicken me, was the overused of the 3D. There was so many images, being thrown in your face that it becomes deadening overkill. It gave me, a headache like the flashing news opening. Clearly, somebody was trying to rip-off, the Daily Prophet. It really doesn't fit in this type of a world. If that wasn't bad, enough. The CGI gore effects were also really bad. It's sad, because the original had some of the best visual effects, at the time. I really couldn't get behind the film, due to how cheap and fake, it look. Another thing that was jarring, was the overused of full-frontal nudity that for the most part, wasn't needed. It was very gimmicky. It must had been very uncomfortable for actress Betsy Rue as the character, Irene to bare it all. It really felt that she got exploited by writers, Todd Farmer and Zane Smith. Even the studio and producers felt that the gore and nudity might had gone too far, as they cut the film from 101 min to 94 mins for some countries like Australia. Then, there was the fact that the movie was going to be released on Friday, February 13, 2009. However, release date was pushed up three weekends to January 23, 2009 so that this film would not have to compete with Friday the 13th remake, a film with a much bigger name. Overall: while the movie was still a success at the box office. I really don't get, why some people like this movie, over the original, because it's bad. For me, it's not worth digging for. Its cheap thrills that really lack imagination. I really hate it. This movie will not get any love, from me.",/review/rw2044345/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2009,JoeKarlosi,7," My Bloody Valentine 3-D (2009) ***
","Remake of the 1981 slasher film about a maniac in a coal miner's outfit slaughtering everyone, and a worthy retread of the original. These days there has been a return of sorts to the unrestrained gory days of early '80s slasher films, and this one delivers in all those typical categories you'd expect -- the over-the-top mutilations and gore sequences, the gratuitous sex (including full frontal female nudity) and people getting theirs in a variety of inventive ways. At least it's a step up in that the main cast and victims are not just silly teenagers, but rather silly 20-somethings and older this time out. And it is a very nice bonus getting a return from old timer Tom Atkins as a retired policeman in the mix, too.",/review/rw2044345/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2009,Quebec_Dragon,6," Mining the slasher genre for nuggets of originality
","My Bloody Valentine 3d is a remake from an old Canadian horror film. It's also a throwback to the maniac serial killer/slasher genre from the seventies/eighties but with some modern touches. First of all, I'm not sure it would have been made and released without the 3d gimmick. I watched it home with standard 3d glasses and the 3d effects were fairly good especially the fences and pickaxes. The only problem of course being that the colors are not as nice as the 2d version also available on the DVD/Blu-Ray. With that out of the way, it's a pretty standard slasher, with a deranged miner with costume and gas mask as the protagonist, but it starts the carnage very quickly without much of a buildup except for some kind of story recap background as if it was a direct sequel (it's not). After a few slaughters, it's 10 years later. That was pretty bold and cool. As you might expect, killings start happening again after an old survivor from the first incident comes back to town.",/review/rw2044345/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2009,Red_Identity,," An extremely fun and gory return to old-school Slasher Horror!
","Horror is one of my favorite genres. Whether it is serious sophisticated horror, or loud, gory, cheesy horror, I will watch it! My Bloody Valentine is a return to the 80's style slasher genre that is so over-the-top, loud, gory, and extremely entertaining and fun! I expected nothing more and nothing less than a very good 'trashy' film, and that is what I got. The opening credits were very inventive, and from the get-go the film starts off with all the possible gore. The writing and directing are good for what the film is. The acting was not bad, even for a film of this kind. Most were OK, but both Jensen Ackles and Kerr Smith are very talented actors, and are the only ones in the film that actually give very good performances. Kerr Smith is very natural, and Jensen Ackles has always been great in the T.V. cult show, Supernatural, and he portrayed some of those talents here. Although still nothing incredibly special, but for a film like this, I think it is better that way. There are a lot of great chase scenes, and the ending was very good, more than I expected. The end credits were also fabulous. I am one of those who watched it in regular 2-D, so I am expecting even more fun with 3-D! But grab a lot of your friends, have loud stereo sound, and prepare to have a lot of fun! My Bloody Valentine is thrilling, entertaining, and even funny at times. The only recent old-style slasher film, and personally one of my horror faves!",/review/rw2044345/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2011,KineticSeoul,5," There is just way too many horror flicks that is better than this, isn't uber terrible though
","This is probably the first 3D horror flick I seen, and to my surprise it wasn't at terrible as I thought it would be. The whole movie comes down to how many different ways to kill people with a pickaxe. The 3D I guess in this is alright and for some that really enjoy seeing nudity in movies, there is a full frontal nudity scene in this. The script isn't anything great and there really isn't much tension or scares in this. The main thing that drives this movie is to figure out what is going on and who the killer is, although it's still mostly predictable. And the 3D is basically the only thing going for it besides figuring out who the killer is. It's basically below average slasher movie, I heard the older version is pretty good but watching this movie sort of turned me off from seeing the original. But maybe I will check it out someday, anyways besides the 3D which isn't all that good this movie is mostly a waste of time. For the audiences that don't know much about horror elements I guess might sort of enjoy this, but for horror buffs this is a pass. There is plenty of better horror movies out there than this.",/review/rw2044345/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2016,davispittman,8," Enjoyable slacker flick
","My bloody valentine the remake is a pretty good time, it does have its flaws, but all in all, it delivers on its promises. One thing I didn't like was the extremely graphic sexual content and full frontal nudity, there is even a pretty prolonged scene featuring full frontal female nudity the whole time, I just thought was overload. Also, the gore got to be a little too much, some of the killings were just like oh my god I need to cover my eyes LOL. But other than that, the movie was actually pretty well written, the dialogue was a lot better than usual slasher movies. Jenson Ackles is good in the lead, I thought that was a good casting decision. And the rest of the cast did a well enough job here too, they weren't like the run of the mill stupid horror movie characters, that sure is good to see. The cardboard cut out characters in modern day slasher films are getting pretty darn old! The ending was great! I really did enjoy the ending to this film, well not the very last like 30 seconds, when/if you watch it you'll understand what I'm talking about. The last 30 seconds are kind disappointing, but overall this is a pretty well made modern day remake of the 1981 original horror film. Unfortunately I cannot compare the 2 because I have not seen the 1981 version. 8/10, had to take off points for some of the overly graphic content.",/review/rw2044345/?ref_=tt_urv

","I really like this movie. This starts of with an explosion in the mine. Harry is sent to the hospital and put in a coma, then after amount of time he wakes up with revenge. He then starts killing 22 people in his path before the sheriff and deputies catch up to him in the mines with Harry using pick Axe killing people with it and leaving human hearts in chocolate heart boxes for valentines. The sheriff finally kills Harry in the mine while Tom and his girlfriend and his friends are being hacked up by this maniac. Tom and his girlfriend and his friend and his girlfriend make it out of the situation when sheriff kills Harry. Then it switches to 10 years later, when all of a sudden Tom comes back to town from running away from the horror he went through and him leaving his girlfriend to marry his best friend that became the new sheriff of the town. He came back to sell the mines, but after a few killings he decides to change his mind. Then his friend the sheriff become suspicious of Tom and thinks he is doing the killings of Harry like a copycat. The killing keep happening just like Harry did 10 years ago, and Tom makes it look like the sheriff is the killer. Well, pretty obvious at the end you know who is the killer. The first suspicion is correct by the sheriff after Tom gets back to town. It has some twists and turns thinking that it would not be the person that is killing. I did not watch it 3-d which would of been nice. Even seeing it in 2-d, I could tell where it would be 3-d. The ending make it look like a sequel will be out in the future. I recommend seeing it.
