25 September 2010,lisafordeay,8," I am 19 years old and I hate to say this but I love Hannah Montana
",I can't believe that so many people dislike this TV show because they hate Miley Cryus and they don't like the show. Just because she is too mature for her age and is a real daddy's girl doesn't mean that people should hate her for that. Anyway about the TV show the show is about a young teenager named Miley Stewart who by day is a country gal and by night with the help of some clothes and a blonde wig she is Hannah Montana. The music is alright and the plot is funny. I find Cyrus to be funny as she always says Jackson said something about what? and she's always fighting with her brother Jackson.,/review/rw2238925/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2010,josemedeirosforsenate13,9," A good show that teach's children values, such as ethics, honesty, and fairplay!
","Why are there so many bad reviews? and Why is this show so immensely popular? I have to admit I never watched the show until last year, and watched my first episode a few months ago and thought, hey this is a good show for children, and enjoyed watching it with my nephew who is six and niece who is five ( They love her and the cast). I also bought the Hannah Montana movie, and also enjoyed watching it. First this is a show that is geared towards children, but I also found that it taught good moral values, ethics, and diversity.

8 July 2009,lenny22,9," Hannah Montana Is AWESOME
","I originally thought here we go again, another annoying stupid lame t.v show that means nothing. But when i watched it i was really surprised. Hannah Montana is actually a really cool show. Miley Cyrus is so funny at times and is a likable character. Lily - is so funny and a character and is unique Oliver - is just plain weird but enjoyable to watch. Jackson - is the most relatable character in the series , if you are the middle child or an older sibling is always getting the attention , in this case Miley having all the attention. i personally relate to him. The episodes are very entertaining , especially when Lily and Oliver start dating. Overall an awesome show. 9/10",/review/rw2238925/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2008,Zaptharo,1," One of the many examples of why Disney has gone downhill...
","Did I like Disney at one time? I sure did. Especially the Disney Channel, which once had a whole variety of programs to choose from, including those from when Walt Disney himself was still around. But now, those days are over, and the company is now referred to as a has been. I've tried to tolerate Disney in recent years, but anymore, the majority of what comes out of it is plain crap. The show Hanna Montana is a good indication of that.",/review/rw2238925/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2007,TOMNEL,1," Really bad
","I do not find this show at all funny. I actually think it is much worse than any of the other terrible Disney channel sit-coms right now. Miley Cyrus is an interesting choice to play Miley aka Hannah Montanna, because she can't sing, and she can't act. The jokes on this show are terribly unfunny, and it makes it even worse when the only cast member that has a little bit (and I mean little bit) of acting talent is Emily Osment as Miley's friend Lily. Bily Ray Cyrus and Jason Earles portray Miley's father (and is her father) and Jason Earles portrays her idiot brother thats always getting in to some stupid shenanigan. Two words that can really describe this show is terribly corny. It's corny humor that only little girls find funny because their brains have not developed yet. Now I've explained my hatred for the acting and the horrible humor, what's next? The whole premise of the show is a stupid idea. She puts on a wig and suddenly nobody recognizes her? It's moronic. In summation, I hate this show, however little girls who do not have a concept of funny will enjoy it, so I guess that's what they're going for over quality.",/review/rw2238925/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2007,atomius,1," A American 'comedy'. cough.
","Hannah Montana is a famous pop' singer who has to lead a double life (by her own will it appears) as a normal pre-teen in Malibue, California. That sounds good, doesn't it? No. In fact this is one of the worst 'comedies' i have seen, and i've seen Reba and 8 Simple Rules. Hannah and her best friend are supposedly normal pre-teens (i shudder to think what normal adults will be like in the near future) who have to face the usual anticipated challenges of school, 'dating' and 'hanging around'. The idea of a famous star living a normal life could've been done so much better, but it wasn't. The music is awful (both the country music she sings (i admit i hate country music) and the background music) and the gags are terrible. The jokes and scenes involving Billy Ray, who is apparently her manager, aren't that funny either. The best gag i've seen is reminiscent of 'that's so raven'esquire jokes involving bold and unintelligent visual gags based on dim wittedness or lame attempts at covering up some crime or act. Put frankly, this isn't worth watching. Try an episode and you won't be screaming for an encore from this 'star'.",/review/rw2238925/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2007,randomspontaneity,1," How is this show as well-liked as it is? (possible spoilers)
","Why is this show so immensely popular? Back in 2006, I saw the first episode and thought, Hey, this isn't so bad. As the series progressed, however, I found Hannah Montana to be incredibly dull, unrealistic, and a terrible example for children.",/review/rw2238925/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2008,CazMcGovernMcKinnon,1," wouldn't even give it a one
","One thing to say that just needs to be said which sums up this show in a nut shell : Disney have lost all credibility. First of all, to be fair, I am not a young kid so I don't know how young kids feel about this show, but the show consists of (apparently) teenagers. When are Disney going to stop trying to pull off a show about teenagers? Either stop being so conservative and actually show what real teenagers are like or stop humiliating these poor kid actors who are reduced to portraying ultimately complete dorks on the screen. This show is embarrassingly unfunny- Billy Ray Cyrus had one hit album like what a million years ago and now thinks of himself as an actor? Its painful to watch him act and I think bad acting is genetic because shes even worse. The only remotely funny people in the show are Mylee's two friends whom are still not given much to work with script wise but could probably be funny doing something real. The show is simply stupid and made for the mentally retarded. It offers no intelligence, no wit - just the same boring storyline every single episode with the same processed no good acting- I am still scratching my head as to why this show has done so well. Please God - just do us all a favour and take it off the air?",/review/rw2238925/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2006,Cutelizzy,10," Hannah Montana rocks!
","Hannah Montana is a great show because it's funny, and you can kind of relate to all the characters. If you have something to hide that you don't want anyone to know, you can relate to Miley. If you're the middle child or if your sister or brother gets all the attention, you can totally relate to Jackson, Miley's older brother.",/review/rw2238925/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2006,dramaqueen-20,9," Rockin' Show
","The main reason that I wanted to see Hannah Montana the first time was because of Emily Osment, who I am a huge fan of. After I saw it, I was instantly hooked. The story of Miley, aka Hannah Montana, leading her double life in Malibu is touching, funny, and a definite Disney classic. In the role of Miley Stewert is Miley Cyrus, whose acting and singing prove why she was chosen for the leading role. Mitchel Musso and Emily Osment as her two friends Oliver and Lily, respectively, are both riots in their hilarious roles. The directors certainly picked the right people, and the chemistry between these three makes the show worth while. As Miley's dad and brother, Cyrus's real life father plays Robby the dad, while Jason Earles is knock-out hysterical in his role as Jackson the brother. The cast is all awesome, though the shining stars are, in my opinion, Osment, Musso, and Earles. One of my favorite parts about the show is the fact that the dad is not a dumb dad like in so many other TV series. The relationship between Miley and her dad is very cool, and it almost reminds me of my dad and I. TV needs a little more cool dad, like in That's So Raven, instead of dumb dads like Homer Simpson. All in all, Hannah Montana is a great new Disney show. I enjoy it, and I hope you will too.",/review/rw2238925/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2006,moosie746,9," Finally a good new show!
","I think Hannah Montana is a far-fetched, but good idea. It's creative and new, and actually had me laughing a few times. It's about a teen (Miley Stewart) who lives a double life as teen pop sensation Hannah Montana. While dealing with her secret celebrity life, she also has to deal with regular teen problems and the occasional clash of her superstar and normal life. The lines are fairly well-written with some good jokes. Yes, some of the punch lines can be seen from a mile away, but it's a good show for all ages and one of Disney's better creations.",/review/rw2238925/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2012,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,5," A very decent premise, but later becomes repetitive
","Let's just say that I saw some of the episodes of Hannah Montana and I thought they were decent with some funny humor. But then, as the show went on, it started to become repetitive because some of the characters had no personalities other than being one-dimensional morons! At least the show had ended a year ago. Don't get me wrong, it had a very decent premise, but it was just executed so terribly.",/review/rw2238925/?ref_=tt_urv

","OK, I really did like this show. I think its very original. I do like Miley Cyrus. She's a pretty good singer. I laughed out loud at some jokes. Some were corny, some were hilarious. But.. Miley/ Hannah- She has a good voice and has great acting skills. Lilly/Lola- Shes funny and a tiny bit dull. Oliver- A good actor, not the best..but still, ill give him my props. Jackson- He's funny, hahahah VERY funny. Robbie- OK, he's pretty funny. and a good actor. Rico- The funniest character in the whole show!!! He cracks me up! OK, well there you have it. I think Hannah Montana is a good show for ages 6-14, so watch it, you'll enjoy it. I sure did!",/review/rw2238925/?ref_=tt_urv

","Poor Walt, poor Walt sacrificed life and limb and had such a rough childhood, his only escape was this film company of his... am I the only one who remembers this? If so, I must tell you that Disney is, unfortunately, only in Tinsel Town because it's the only way McDonalds can persuade kids to waste there money on Fatty Meals. Dianey Channel was, and still is, a crappy idea. I mean shows like 'Suite Life' are tolerable but HSM, Jump In! Disney, YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR!!!!! It's as clear as crystal that this show is only too promote a singer who can't sing. It's like a Spiceworld for our generation. This crap is loaded with terrible jokes, bad acting, and... Billy Ray Cyrus! How can people stand this!?!",/review/rw2238925/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,1," Entertaining... but for all the wrong reasons!
","I used to watch The Disney Channel all the time, now I don't because I can't stand some of the shows. With the exception of Phineas and Ferb, I don't like a vast majority of the shows airing now and this is no exception. Hannah Montana as I've said is entertaining, but for all the wrong reasons. Some of the acting is laughably bad, not only from Miley Cyrus(surprise, surprise) but also Billy Ray Cyrus as well. Sometimes the only bearable acting comes from Jason Earles, Emily Osment(mostly because of her charm) and Moises Arias. The writing is clichéd and predictable, and the story lines range from unbelievable to non existent. And don't get me started on the characters, they are as clichéd and obnoxious as the writing, and the soundtrack is grating. Not to mention the tacky sets and the often ridiculous costumes. Overall, this show is very bad, but it entertains for reasons that are often the wrong ones. 1/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2238925/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2007,witchsmeller-1,2," it is so evil....
","This terrible show is another failed attempt by Disney channel to appeal to girls (and sadly some boys) between the ages of 10-14. The acting on the show is really annoying, and worst of all they make little annoying kids say ""aaa oh!"". Then the little kids see it, and think it originated from Hannah Montana. Little kids running around everywhere screaming ""aaa oh!"" (the RICO kid is the main culprit. one of the worst parts of the show is how it gives the idea that Hannah is a nice person. Yeah right. A girl like her would make fun of people for looking different than her: for example... if a kid did not have long hair and ride a skateboard she would call him a nerd and toy around with his emotions! The character is shallow and cruel. I am also sick with how Disney gives every boy in their shows long hair. oliver looks like a girl! It is making everyone now-a-days look alike. Why doesn't he grow a Mohawk, or even a mullet. anything to end this fad of looking like a skateboarder. Now i'm even for bringing back Spike hair. (i am also enraged at boys wearing tight pants. yeah they think they look cool now, but how will they feel in 15 years when they are sterile...)how cool would it be if every boy on the show looked different. the oliver kid could have a mullet, Jackson could have a Mohawk...etc. This domination of white kids with long hair and tight pants is really annoying..and shows like Hannah Montana aren't helping! Disney! bring back good shows. don't produce tripe like Hannah Montana that teaches kids to be fashion Na-z-is to one another!",/review/rw2238925/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2008,ellen-137,1," Polluting my TV screen!!!
","This has to be one of the worst television shows that I have ever seen and that is saying something. Why is it so bad? Where to start? The acting is awful and not funny at all even though this calls itself a comedy. The humour is forced and it is like the actors are holding up ""laugh"" cards so the studio audience (who should be paid a fortune for sitting through it and forcing themselves to laugh) know when to. Miley Cyrus can not act and ever line she says is like she has been forced into to it. Her character is irritating as the pop star/ ordinary girl who just wants to be like everyone else but have the pop star life style as well. Each plot of every episode is Miley Stewart getting into a tricky situation, almost being uncovered as Hannah Montanna, then not and everyone is happy. Plus Miley walking around with her arms swinging about making a weird expression with her teeth. The other characters don't make this any more interesting and are just as annoying. Billy Ray Cyrus makes constant references to his one and only hit and writes songs for his daughter which, lets be frank, aren't any better. Jason Earls is the only reason this got one star as he can be quite funny but sadly that doesn't happen often. Overall a truly awful show that should be taken off the air immediately.",/review/rw2238925/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2006,ertlejosh,10," Finally Something Great on the Disney Channel
","The Disney Channel used to be a very good network in the 90's but for the past few years have put some of the stupidest shows on television on Disney and totally went down the drain in quality. So I never watched the network again, well at least not until now. The Disney Channel has something special with new series ""Hannah Montana"". When I saw the promo for this show before it aired I thought it was going to be just another corny show from Disney. I wasn't even planning on watching it but I was bored one day and there was nothing on so I decided to see how bad it really was. In a total surprise I thought it was a delightful and funny show, along with great characters, great acting, and funny scripts. ""Hannah Montana"" starts Miley Cyrus and her dad Billy Ray Cyrus who also plays her dad on Hannah Montana. Miley is really singing pop superstar ""Hannah Montana"", but most of her friends at school have no idea. In the show Miley and her dad moved from Tennessee to Malibu so she can have her music career. Miley's best friend Lilly, played by Emily Osment, adds a lot of humor to the show. The only thing I noticed is that the writers are still seem uncertain of how her character should be permanently act on the show. It seems like the past few episodes that she acts completely different from one episode to another, in different parts. But thats okay because her acting makes up for it. Miley's brother Jackson, played by Jason Earles, adds more humor to the show. I think the entire cast is great. But the best thing is that its a real funny show. Yes there are sometimes in the show where it gets a little corny but I can deal with that, plus I understand its geared for younger teens. I am 20 years old and never watch shows like this but this one is not just for kids, its for anyone. Its a cleaver show and its entertaining. I give it a 10/10 because it had to take something amazing to get me to watch a Disney Channel show, but ""Hannah Montana"" has got me hooked. It's way much better than Lizzie McGuire. I am not a fan of the music, but thats not my style anyways, but you don't have to like the music to think that Miley Cyrus is a great young actress. She has a big acting career ahead of her. Overall if you haven't checked out ""Hannah Montana"" yet, CHECK IT OUT.",/review/rw2238925/?ref_=tt_urv
