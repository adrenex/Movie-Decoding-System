8 June 2010,imdbbl,," Low-budget gem
","Eight talented candidates have reached the final stage of selection to join the ranks of a mysterious and powerful corporation. Entering a windowless room, an Invigilator gives them eighty minutes to answer one simple question. He outlines three rules they must obey or be disqualified: don't talk to him or the armed guard by the door, don't spoil their papers and don't leave the room. He starts the clock and leaves. The candidates turn over their question papers, only to find they're completely blank. Soon enough, the candidates begin to uncover each other's background, prejudices and hidden agendas. Tensions rise as the clock steadily descends towards zero, and each candidate must decide how far they are willing to go to secure the ultimate job.",/review/rw5260200/?ref_=tt_urv

11 June 2014,bob the moo,," Starts with a great premise but gets less engaging the longer it goes on (SPOILERS)
","Eight candidates for a job enter an exam room to find pencils and a piece of paper, numbered for them. The invigilator of the exam introduces the rules and then leaves. The eight turn over their papers to begin, only to find they are all blank. When one is dragged from the room for breaking the rule about not spoiling her paper, the other realize the stakes and the seriousness of the few words the invigilator said before he left – and more importantly they realize the freedom they were left by what was not said. With the 80 minute time ticking down, they try to figure out what the question is that they're trying to answer.",/review/rw5260200/?ref_=tt_urv

","In a near future, eight candidates are in the final stage for the position of CEO's assistant in a pharmaceutical corporation. They are locked in a room and the invigilator tells them that they have eighty minutes to answer one question only. He explains that in the lawless space there are only three rules to be followed otherwise they would be disqualified: they should talk neither to him nor to the armed guard; they should not spoil their piece of paper; and they should not leave the room. He starts the chronometer and leaves the room. Then the candidates discover that they have a blank piece of paper with their numbers only. One woman starts writing on the paper and is removed from the room for spoiling the paper. The other candidates figure out that they are allowed to talk to each other and they need teamwork to discover the questions. As far as the time runs out, the tension increases.

25 July 2011,Leofwine_draca,2," Not one you'd want to sit through
","Drawing on all manner of films that have come before – I'm thinking of the likes of 12 ANGRY MEN as well as more recent fare such as CUBE – EXAM wants nothing more than to be a taught little thriller with an intriguing premise: eight candidates in a room, taking an exam that consists of a blank sheet of paper. The movie takes place in real time, inside a single room, with the utter exclusion of special effects, focusing solely on the character interactions that take place. With such a premise, you know that the plotting and the scripting better be darn good, and unfortunately in EXAM's case, it just isn't.",/review/rw5260200/?ref_=tt_urv

Of course, once they actually find the question first that's easy, or... is it? ",/review/rw5260200/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2011,sofiepeterson,8," Exciting!
","What an exciting movie! I had absolutely no expectations of this film. I had never even heard of it when I came across it. Since I've seen a lot of movies lately that have most often disappointed me, I thought this would be another one. But I'm glad to say it wasn't. I have a hard time concentrating when watching movies, I often turn my attention to something else and because of that I get lost in the plot. Some movies though, manages to keep me focused on the movie the entire time and this was one of those movies. I love a good mystery, where the movie makes you really think. When you try to solve the mystery (this time, the question) yourself. So I stayed focused every minute and it never got boring. It's basically a riddle and if you think you're smart enough, watch it and see if you can come up with the right answer before the characters do! ;)",/review/rw5260200/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2012,zarajasmin1586,5," Good buildup but badly concluded
","The movie was really solid in the first half but continues to try my patience the closer it gets to concluding. The plot is not entirely original but well-executed. The concept was interesting and as the story progresses, you start to care about what happens to the characters as much as what the answer to the question is.",/review/rw5260200/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2010,harry_tk_yung,," EMBA team-building session, the first half at least ?
","While most comparisons of this British movie are made with various TV drama series and contest game show like The Apprentice, the survival aspect being dominating, it is in some ways not unlike a team-building session in an EMBA program, at least the first half of the movie. Then it does become more and more like one of those ""and then there were none"" survival sequences. One more point by way of general background, there is lurking in the bigger backdrop a spreading contagious virus which reminds you of another British movie ""28 days later"". When did the Brits become so epidemic-paranoid? While similar to the Canadian movie ""Cube"" where everything happens in a closed space, ""Exam"" has different premises: 8 candidates competing for a most lucrative job offered by a dream company. They are locked in an exam room furnished in Spartan simplicity for 80 minutes (with a countdown digital time device), accompanied with an armed guard. The exam paper is a single sheet with the candidate's number and nothing at the back. They have to prove that they are the best man or women for the job, and heaven knows how.",/review/rw5260200/?ref_=tt_urv

","The set-up is obviously borrowed from a vastly superior Italo-Argentinian-Spanish co-production ""The Method"": a number of carefully selected candidates gathered in a secluded room are supposed to hold a tricky qualification test.

26 April 2012,ronnelmoreno,9," Impressive movie!
","I'm very excited upon seeing the film and sitting through it, for I expected that it would give me an impressive outcome, and I have to say, It did deliver. Exam is a low-budgeted film, which has 8 main character, a guard, and an invigilator. Despite of the said budget, It was able to give me a solid plot, awesome acting and great ending. Though the movie do not have a lot of gore scenes (I guess none at all), nor lots of screaming and killing. It was still great. It will keep you guessing and guessing and, simultaneously discovering the characters background, this movie is not boring at all, It'll keep you thinking and wait to see if your guess is right. This movie, only proved that budget is not a major factor in creating a ground-breaking movie. Exam is one of a kind and I wish to see more of this. 9/10.",/review/rw5260200/?ref_=tt_urv
