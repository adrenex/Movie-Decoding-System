21 July 2006,yo-saff-brig,9," A Poignant Tribute For Fans, Unfortunately, No Giant Spiders
","Clerks II:**** Clerks II is a strong and poignant retelling of the story of when two slackers grow into adulthood. In many ways this is writer/director Kevin Smith's most adult film in that we see four characters that we've grown up with over the past 12 years finally grow themselves. It opens on the final day of work for Dante who is finally getting up and out of Jersey with his fiancé, leaving Randal figuratively alone at Mooby's. Randal hasn't changed much over the past years, and in many cases neither has Dante. Randal still wrestles with the customers in pitiful pop culture debates, among them whether the LOTR trilogy is better than the Star Wars trilogy, but this time around he has a new foil in a 19 year old gamer-geek named Elias. The banter between these two is really funny especially when Randal tells him what he has planned for Dante's departure gift (but you'll have to see the flick to find out what that is because it is too gross for me even to write). After a short stint in re-hab Jay and Silent Bob have found solace in the Lord but this doesn't stop them from the dispensing with the drugs. Its odd to find that in the past decade it is Jay and Silent Bob that have changed the most, true they still are up to their perverse antics such as ass rubbing on the window and the disturbing recreation of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" dance but they have grown more sensitive to other people's emotions and needs, especially Jay. I haven't mentioned Rosario Dawson, who gives a very charming performance as the clerks' boss. She brings a lot of presence to a slightly underdeveloped character. But it is Jeff Anderson, Randal, that deserves the full attention this time around. He gives an award worthy performance and delivers it with an astonishing amount of sympathy. He's loosing his best friend which, though he'd never show it, absolutely devastates him. The last 20 minutes are really tear jerking, I know I was in tears and couldn't stop the flow. This film sort of keeps to the feel Smith created with Chasing Amy and Jersey Girl in that they lay the drama on thick and it almost works better than the comedy, an oddity for Smith proving he too has grown as a writer. It isn't all drama though you do get great comedic scenes such as, my favorite, the ""porch monkey"" scene. I nearly had laughing tears during it. This is probably Smith's best looking film elevating it to the quality one would get whilst watching a really good episode of television. The camera even moves! And a neat little digital effect is shown at the beginning where the clerks' world seamlessly transforms from black and white to color, I was shocked because I didn't even realize it was happening. This is one of Smith's best films and one of the year's best. I give it a high recommendation but I ask that you stick with it a little while because it moves at a slower pace then any of the other Jersey Chronicles, it may take a bit of getting used to for some, but this is a film that can not be missed.",/review/rw1440903/?ref_=tt_urv

","In New Jersey, when Dante (Brian O'Halloran) arrives to open the convenience store ""Quick Stop Groceries"" for another labor day, he finds the place on fire. The losers Dante and his friend Randal (Jeff Anderson) find another job position in the fast food restaurant Mooby's, managed by Becky (Rosario Dawson), and working with the Christian employee Elias (Trevor Fehrman). The new and improved potheads and drug dealers Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) also move their traffic spot to the new location. Dante is planning a new life in Florida getting married with his fiancée Emma (Jennifer Schwalbach) while his friend Becky is a woman that does not believe in romantic love. On the eve of Dante's departure to Florida, Randal decides to promote a farewell and bachelor party to his best friend, and he invites Kelly and the Sexy Stud (Zak Knutson) from Tijuana to heat the celebration. However, things go wrong and Dante rethinks his future.",/review/rw1440903/?ref_=tt_urv

","You'll like Clerks 2. If you liked the original Clerks, this is Kevin's Smith's masterpiece. It mirrors the original Clerks, but it shows how much he's grown as a writer and a director. From the black and white/color shots, to the crane shot (a *beep* crane shot), to just the placement of people in the Camera shots...everyone one of these things contributed to the overall enjoyment of this movie.",/review/rw1440903/?ref_=tt_urv

",You don't see the words excellent sequel together very often but this film lives up to them. I have not laughed out loud in a movie in a very long time. I almost couldn't catch my breath from laughing so hard. This movie is just awesome. Kudos Mr. Smith and crew. Every part of this movie is worth watching from the opening credits to the very last frame of the film. Kevin Smith plays to the fans of his films and we appreciate every last bit of it. We are rabid and loyal and this film does not disappoint. At the theatre I watched it in the entire audience cheered when it began and were clapping and cheering at the end. I could have watched it again immediately.,/review/rw1440903/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2006,kirk_williams,1," Kevin Smith = Most Overrated Writer/Director of the Past Twenty Years
","Yep. Although he seems like a nice enough guy to grab a beer with and shoot the gab. Unfortunately he can't write dialogue and I'm tired of the same tired old clichés and flat jokes he trots out every two or three years to keep his mouth-breathing perpetually pubescent fanbase satisfied. Was I expecting an enlightening experience from Clerks II? Of course not. But I was expecting a few laughs, and I didn't get them. A couple of chuckles here and there, but nothing I wouldn't get from listening to drunks outside my window on a Friday night. And that's unscripted and free of charge.",/review/rw1440903/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2006,teh_mode,5," A mixed bag
","Okay first thing's first, of course it is not a patch on the original. It was never going to be. Clerks numero uno is probably one of the funniest films of all time, and certainly one of the most verbally graphic too, and it wouldn't have mattered had the laughter count in its sequel outweighed Smith's debut by ten to one, I doubt there is any way even the most devout Smithite would have the same affinity to his latest project. So stop making pointless comparisons between the two. If anything a much more apt comparison to be made would be between Mallrats, our director's sophomore effort. I simply came into this movie expecting to see Dante, Randal et al do what they do best. Smith has returned to doing what he knows best: following Star Wars loving, comic book reading uber-slackers as they f' up yet another establishment from the inside. Jay And Silent Bob are back too. Surely this wouldn't misfire as much as his recent project did. Surely",/review/rw1440903/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2006,shutterboss,9," A must see
","I saw an early screening of C2 and I must say that the flick is way better than anyone thought it would be. Mr. Smith is back in prime form and I would dare to say that this is quite possibly his best work yet. Granted, this is not a film for everyone but, if you are not offended by purposefully vulgar humor, C2 should be on your ""must see"" list. Dante (Brian O' Halloran) and Randal (Jeff Anderson) are back with their humorous banter as if a whole decade had not gone by since we saw them last. Dante/Brian is practically flawless as the straight man while Randal/Jeff is one of the funniest actors around and their on-screen chemistry is simply wonderful. The new guy Elias (Trevor Fuhrman from ""Now You Know"") is a clever addition to the group while Rosario Dawson shines her irresistible charm on this little world of dysfunctional employees. The combination is a winning one and, if you add an healthy dose of Jay and Silent Bob to the mix, and even a musical number worthy of ""The Blues Brothers"", you have quite possibly the best comedy of the summer. This film is enjoyable even if you are not familiar with the original Clerks, but it's even better if you are. To top it all off, Kevin Smith shows us that he has learned from his mistakes and has now mastered the fine art of balancing comedy with truly heartfelt moments, staying clear of the sappiness that sunk ""Jersey Girl"". At the end of the film there were quite a few shiny eyes in the audience... bravo Mr Smith! You pulled off your best trick yet.",/review/rw1440903/?ref_=tt_urv

27 July 2006,jotix100,4," Minimum wagers
","If success is measured by the size of an audience, or by the amount of laughs a film produces, then ""Clerks II"" could be deemed a failure. Judging by the reaction at a screening at the Angelika the other day, where the film is playing in two of the biggest theaters, and the couple of feeble laughs it provoked in an audience of less than thirty people, this movie is definitely not a winner.",/review/rw1440903/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was lucky enough to go to an advanced screening of this film, a luxury not often afforded to us normal movie goers, and a luxury not appreciated by a critic that I don't need to name. This movie was filled with laughs, but still managed to tell a truly genuine story. A story about people that get trapped in their dead end jobs, and struggle to find happiness and try to decide what they want in life. Eventually teaching acceptance and promoting individualism rather than trying to live up to some kind of social standard.",/review/rw1440903/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2015,ironhorse_iv,7," Dante's divine comedy was couther-culture, indeed. A cult-favorite of mine.
","Most main-stream comedies would try to have over-the-top fantasy life premises, in which the audience can lance on, because how bizarre & surreal, it is. However, some of the better comedies, known for their Seinfeldian humor, idiosyncratic focus on more conversational everyday stuff that some audience might find mundane. Then, there are those, whom can mix, both of them, well-enough, that the audience can find, the simplest of premise, funny. This is one of those movies. Directed & written by Kevin Smith, Clerks 2 is a follow-up to the highest successful 1994's movie, Clerks and Smith's sixth feature film to be set in the View Askewniverse AKA Kevin Smith's fictional universe from the first film. Ten years after the events in Clerks, Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) & Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) find themselves working at a local fast food joint, after their previous work, Quick Stop Store, burned down, a year ago. Dante has plans to move away from town and get married, but Randal cannot yet, allow his long-last friend to leave, without one last goodbye party. While, Randal set up the party at the workplace, Dante is struggles with his mixed feelings for his current boss, manager, Becky Scott (Rosario Dawson) & his love for his fiancée, Emma Bunting (Jennifer Schwalbach). Will the goodbye party go according plan, or will Dante & Randal find themselves, making a bigger mess than before? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, it's nice to see Kevin Smith retackling his old films; however, in retrospect, it's generally viewed as Smith trying to rebound after his commercial failure in his non-View Askewniverse movie, 2004's Jersey Girl. Much like the original movie, the sequel to Clerks, also take place over the course of one day, and loosely connected with a series of small discussion skits and gags. But unlike, the first movie, the movie doesn't make too much jokes about the settling of the film. For a movie that mostly takes place at a fast food joint. I'm really surprised on the lack of jokes about junk food. You would think, the movie would be full of it. Anyways, the movie instead, tackles other issues, such as debates over movies, sexual positions, religion, racism, and romantic love versus pragmatic life choices. Like the first movie, the dialogue is rife with obscenities. Over 130 curse words, to start, as well as a lot of homosexual & racism slurs. The movie also has explicit jokes about bestiality, rape & others that some people might feel uncomfortable with. For me, the oddest thing about the film is having Jason Mewes as Jay do his 1991's the Silence of the Lambs, ""Goodbye Horses"" dance. That was really out of place & inappropriate. Even with all those, kinda offensive humor and jokes. There were some witty, somewhat heartfelt moments in the film. I did like the whole Jackson 5 'ABC"" musical number. For the most part, all of these scenes serves mostly as filler. It really takes forever, for the weak main plot to kick in. The fact that the majority of that scene was ad-libbed, added to the pacing problems. While, the movie is not well-paced. The acting in this film was pretty good for the most part. The main actors, supporting actors, and cameos, all did their parts, very well. I have to say, my favorite actor in this, had to be Trevor Fehrman as Elias Grover, Dante and Randal's new co-worker at the Mooby's fast food chain. It sucks that he hasn't acted since this movie, because I found him to be, very funny. The worst acting in the film has to go to Jennifer Schwalbach. I'm really didn't buy anything, she was saying. Her performance was so wooden. Another thing, that was way different from the first movie, is how this sequel was in color & not in black & white. But as mentioned in the DVD commentary for this film, the entire film was desaturated, a bit after filming, because the colors were far too bright and cheery. In my opinion, I didn't mind that it was, as it adds so much to the cartoony astrosphere, giving the film a far, greater look. It reminds me, so much of the early 2000's animated TV Series Clerks with its style. Overall: While, Clerks 2 will never outshine the original. I have to say, it's still a watchable guilty pleasure of mine. Worth checking out. Face it tiger. You just hit the jackpot!",/review/rw1440903/?ref_=tt_urv

","Clerks 2 (2006): Dir: Kevin Smith / Cast: Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Rosario Dawson, Trevor Fehrman, Jennifer Schwallbach: Every bit as raunchy as the first film yet it contains that deep meaningful undercurrent that everyone can relate too whether or not one will admit it. Dante and Randall still work at Quik-Mart until it burns down in the film's opening. A year later they are employed at a fast food restaurant and still causing disgust with customers. Brian O'Halloran returns as Dante who is engaged and set to move to Florida in hopes of expanding his options. Jeff Anderson returns as the foul Randall who rents out a filthy sex exhibitionist as Dante's going away present, which turns out to be the film's grossest joke. Rosario Dawson plays the restaurant manager who actually loves Dante and given sudden news. Trevor Fehrman plays employee Elias whom Randall corrupts from his conservative upbringing of phony sexual myths. Jennifer Schwallbach plays Dante's imposing fiancée who dislikes Randall and encourages him to leave with her. Finally as trademark within Kevin Smith films is clever dialogue as well as the presences of Jay and Silent Bob loitering and dope peddling at the store front. Smith is seen as Silent Bob along with Jason Mewes as foul drug peddling Jay to underscore appreciation or normality of what is often taken for granted. Score: 8 / 10",/review/rw1440903/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2008,fedor8,," While ""Clerks"" was aimed at young guys, ""Clerks 2"" can be enjoyed by women, as well. A warning...
","Watching Dante paint his boss's toes made me wanna vomit. There was something disgusting about that scene, though I can't put my finger (or toe) on exactly what that was. But I guess KS thought this was sexy and/or funny. I was also a bit disgusted that KS would cast his bony, square-headed wife Jennifer Schwalbach as a ""major catch"". Maybe she is a major catch for the likes of Dante or Kevin Smith, but I think casting a real woman - as opposed to a transsexual - would have been more pleasing to the eye and made more sense. Flashing her breasts didn't help either: she still looked like a very skinny guy. Jay and Silent Bob were okay, but even they became tiresome when they started appearing in every other scene toward the end. As for Randal, this guy was the unsentimental a**hole who cared about nothing and no-one - but KS has turned him into a semi-whining moron, the excuse being that he is 33 now! If becoming 33 means that your main characters cease being funny (to a certain extent) then don't bother making a comedy about them...",/review/rw1440903/?ref_=tt_urv

","My review is already on here somewhere but anyway it's been 13 years since it's release (which I can't believe) and I still can't stop watching this movie. I can't recommend a movie more if someone wants to experience a film with a true heart at its core with a ton of laughs along the way. If you've ever experienced true friendship and love this movie is for you. Not sure why I'm even posting I guess because this film is a true work of art. It warms your heart and it ends beautifully and you truly get a sense of closure where other films leave you unsatisfied in one way or another. If you dare and allow it, This film will literally make you laugh and cry, sometimes at the same time. I'm so happy Kevin Smith survived his brush with death because without him I feel like there would be a huge hole in my heart. That goes for Mewes too... I recently met Jason Mewes and he's another guy with a big heart - I need Jay and Silent Bob in my life. This film and his others will always be a part of me. Never would I think my lif would be altered like it has after walking in a dinky theatre in San Diego in 94 and watching Clerks.

","I enjoy Kevin Smith's films and I was looking forward to this one, but I was a little disappointed by this effort. There are some laughs throughout, especially Randall's hilarious impression of the ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy. Jay and Silent Bob are their usual selves, though a bit subdued here. For me, however, a lot of the gags felt forced and the story seemed rather contrived and clichéd. Fifteen minutes into the movie, it was clearly obvious how it would eventually turn out and this lack of plot twist disappointed me. In my opinion, much of the supporting cast's roles did not really seem too well thought-out. While not entirely without its charms, the movie had a ""by-the-numbers"" vibe to me.
