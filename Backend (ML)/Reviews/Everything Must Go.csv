2 July 2004,RussianPantyHog,," Wonderful!
","When I was a lad my father used to take me & my brothers to a Working Mens Club on Saturday nights. It was AWFUL! Old people sat at regimented benches miserably supping ale, useless ventriloquists, tone-deaf singers, crap magicians & an obese nut-case who used to wander around selling cockles and mussels.",/review/rw0786784/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2005,didi-5,," hilarious comedy based in the North West of England
","This comedy, which ran for two series, was co-written by and starred (in several roles), Bolton comic Peter Kay, who has his finger perfectly on the breathing pulse of North West England (speaking as someone the same age as Kay who comes from a part of the NW not a million miles from Bolton). Phoenix Nights was set in a lousy Northern club with 'entertainment', bingo, and droll staff, just the kind of club that existed in the 1970s and 1980s.",/review/rw0786784/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2001,motor89,," Outstanding
","'Phoenix nights' is destined to become a classic of British comedy, in the same league as 'Fawlty Towers' and 'I'm Alan Partidge'. It really is that good.",/review/rw0786784/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2003,SammyK,," Bring this to Canada!
","Just by fluke, I happened to catch an episode of this funny-as-all-hell show while vacationing in the UK. To the powers that be (being the TV station heads here in Canada): please pick up Phoenix Nights, and begin airing episodes here ASAP!  This is too funny to miss! And as a plug to Canadian audiences:  This could easily be a British companion piece to our ""Trailer Park Boys"" (except way better!)",/review/rw0786784/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2003,agmoldham,9," Very Funny
","This is what comedy, and for that matter films, are all about. The characters are deep, real and extremely 	  funny. The beauty is that these are all people we know. At times you may not notice, but Peter Kaye plays several of the 	  characters. My personal favourite is fire officer Keith Lard who interferes with dogs in the worst possible way and 	  has no connection whatsoever with Keith Laird of Bolton Fire Service. Max and Paddy probably take the prize of the 	  regular crew. One of the great things about this series is that every time you watch it, you spot something else that's 	  funny and make sure you listen to the music that's playing. The good news is that series 2 is now out and Max and Paddy 	  will return in their own programme at some point.",/review/rw0786784/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2004,piffel,," So funny
","This IS the best thing on tv (even though it's not on at the moment. inviguratingly funny, showing that Peter Kay is a comic gem. The auditions at the end of each episode make me cry with laughter...the jugula...need i say more? 10 out of 10",/review/rw0786784/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2003,paul2001sw-1,," Superb!
","Peter Kay's 'Phoenix Nights' is simply the funniest British sitcom for years.  The setting is cliched, but its so full of bleak comic invention, every scene bursts with sight and word gags mercifully unflagged by studio laughter.  The underlying sense that there is no salvation for any of these characters adds a poignant edge to the hysteria, and Peter's Kay's Brian Potter is brilliantly foiled by Dave Spikey's Jerry, a man almost (but not quite) intelligent enough to realise he'd be better off somewhere else.  A real gem, utterly silly but very true to life.",/review/rw0786784/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2004,asio-1,," garlic bread IS the future =)
","Peter Kay / Dave Spikey are stand up comedians, very funny ones @ that along with Neil (shabba!) fitzpatrick, hopefully they are getting the reorganization for their work now. They draw a lot of comedy from real life things, which is why things like PN is so funny. (Fawty Towers, is another good example of such a thing).",/review/rw0786784/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2007,general-melchett,9," Absolutely hilarious comedy!
","Let's be honest here - comedies set in working men's clubs are now an old idea now. Phoenix Nights is great, however, and is made better by the fact that it all could happen in real life. Some of the gags are hilarious - and it is good to see how this show has not been ruined by a rubbish third series. My favourite episode was the one where Brian Potter and the guys held a fun day to reopen the Phoenix Club - I was literally wetting myself with laughter when ""Sammy Snake"" rose up in front of an audience watching Jerry sing. The second series is personally my favourite, but the first series has such brilliant things to offer as - a racist folk band, a Western evening from hell, and the prospect of a horrible future for the Phoenix Club. It set the way for a second series, and it is good to see how that managed to maintain the strength of this show's comedy - it can also be quite moving in parts. Phoenix Nights saw when it reached its peak and stopped before it jumped the shark - unlike Little Britain, which is constantly being mined for a hint of a gag and will soon become rather hated than loved. And Brian Potter can be far funnier than Andy and Lou. This was definitely the thing that established Peter Kay as one to be reckoned with - and I can see why. Phoenix Nights is pure genius - prepare to be amused! 9/10",/review/rw0786784/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2005,IridescentTranquility,10," Fantastic
","As a person from the North, I love this. How can anyone not love it? There is so much that is great about Phoenix Nights. One of the things I like most is the way Peter Kay has made all of the characters so real. Brian Potter seems to be out for all he can get - he's a very rounded character. The characters' reactions to all the different situations are ingenious and - to an extent - it is a topical programme. I hope one day people will start to think of it as a British classic. Two episodes I particularly love are the Crimewatch UK-style programme that features the Phoenix Club and also the way the characters rally round for the Stars In Their Eyes night. I have no idea how they came up with so many different acts and so many different costumes. I think the sense of community at the Phoenix Club is an important factor in holding the character together, and I love the way Brian Potter can't stop acting like the manager, even after Jerry St Clair has (supposedly) taken over. People may not like Phoenix Nights but everyone should at least try it.",/review/rw0786784/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2019,jemmajemmajemma,9," Real working class, not Oxbrige who studied what working class is
","I live in the south of England and I can still recognise the situations in a cr ap club, but it's still a brilliant club as a local social meeting place. I had a feeling the writers were real working class, as so much comedy on TV is taken over by Oxbrige ex footlights people, so it's good others have a chance and can show real is better than studying for years what working class people are supposed to be like.
I envy how good the northerners are at bringing humour to everyday situations. They aren't stuffy and find it easy to laugh things.
The bouncy castle reminded me of a real viral video where children were unknowingly sliding out of a part that looked rude, so made me laugh extra loud when something similar was brought to the show.",/review/rw0786784/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2003,LordLucan,," It's Grim Up North
","It's difficult to put a finger on why Phoenix Nights is so invigorating. For a while, you're just knocked for six that a soap opera format can be used so brilliantly, and enjoying the freshness of the (at long, long last) preoccupations of the post-Oxbridge Graduate monopoly on TV comedy. On reflection I think the thing is this: the series concerns itself with a very specific milieu  the Lancashire Catholic working class community (the very same that informed so many of Anthony Burgess's books). This is the defining characteristic for Potter  his sarcasm comes from an inherent toughness that goes with such an environment, a Northerness that looks on the brighter side no matter how awful things get, that sets about getting the job done. Potter is someone who unwittingly finds himself to be a cynic, and struggles to drop the cynicism (too Southern an attribute?), but encounters 101 little events each and every day that underwrite it. And so we're gunning for him; partly deluded he may be, but he's no Keith Lard  ultimately, we laugh with Potter at the world around us.",/review/rw0786784/?ref_=tt_urv

7 July 2006,thecoft01,10," best modern comedy available!!!!!
","I must admit that the league of gentlemen and the office come very close to this as a comedy series, but phoenix nights has it all! the office is brilliant but, there is only one main joke, David Brent, obviously Gareth, Keith and Tim are amazing too but there is only so far you can push this humour, as you end up cringing at Brent sometimes (oi Brent, give it up!) the league of gentlemen is also absolute class, but i think there's a bit more of a story in phoenix nights and as they are all milling about under one roof the opportunities for gags are endless.",/review/rw0786784/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2006,david-2991,10," Northernly BRILLIANT!
","I'd love to give this series about 100/10! The humour in this series is so original, I suppose it helps that I live in Bolton and completely relate to the comedy! I was surprised to hear that when the DVDs were released they sold more in the south of England than they did in the North, but I wonder why southerners ""mock"" us northerners but they love the comedy produced. I have to say my favourite episode was the pilot episode, with the opening of the club, and ""send the buggers back!"". I seriously hope Peter Kay and his fellow writers have enough material to produce a third series, it would be brilliant! My favourite character is Ray Vonn, including the Tracy Burns story lines! I also think the auditions at the end of the episodes are hilarious - bring more of it please!!!!!!",/review/rw0786784/?ref_=tt_urv

24 April 2004,Bobbymak880,10," Bring Phoenix Nights to the USA!
","Some British Comedies don't translate into US sensibilities and are not as funny outside of the UK. Phoenix Nights is NOT one of those. This series is a well-crafted set of stories taking place in a small working-class night club that will keep you laughing long after you press the STOP button. Phoenix Nights works on many levels but it starts with a tight script, delivered with verve by a widely talented cast, flawlessly directed and photographed, every character in the series that contributes a vital beingness to this story of a worn-formica nightclub in Northern England. The sets, staging and costumes are as rich in comedic detail as are the intertwining plots. And the vacuum-tight editing of the series make this one of those shows you'll watch again and again. And if watching Phoenix Nights for laughs isn't enough reason for you to purchase these DVDs, then purchase them to use as a textbook example of how a creative ensemble can work together to produce a first-rate comedy series and put together an informative and entertaining commentary track. Phoenix Nights is the best reason for Americans to purchase a multi-region/multi-standard DVD player. Phoenix Nights may be the most entertaining TV series America never gets to see. If you're NOT in the UK or Europe, here's what you gotta do: - bite the bullet and buy the DVD's from AMAZON.CO.UK and watch it on your computer (The DVD's are Region 2; non-US), or - spend a few bucks and get an all-region DVD player and then watch it via your stereo-connected wide-screen TV, or - sit around and hope and pray that UK's Channel 4 exports the show to a US network.",/review/rw0786784/?ref_=tt_urv

","I never actually watched this series until it came out on video and I am so glad I bought it.  I laughed from the very beginning to the end.  It is hilarious and picks out everything so well.  It really is as if someone has put a hidden camera into a club for a year and this is what came out, only better.  One of the best British comedies ever.  A must see.",/review/rw0786784/?ref_=tt_urv

","After watching the ""Peter Kay: Live at the top of the tower"" video and ""That Peter Kay Thing"" on TV i knew Phoenix Nights was going to be great!! And it was!! Peter's comedy being based on experiences in his live is what makes his shows so funny! Anyone who saw the Parkinson interview will know what i mean. His two characters of Brian and Max are played perfectly (alot of people don't realise he plays two people.. lol) and with other wonderful cast such as Dave Spikey, Patrick McGuinness etc. this show could get at least 4 seasons worth of episodes!!",/review/rw0786784/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2012,neil-arsenal,10," Highly underrated comedy.
","This is hilarious. It really is. Peter Kay, quite rightly, was accused of theft by releasing 'new' stand up DVDs...when it was exactly the same show in a different arena! However, I can forgive anything after seeing Phoenix Nights. The 'Crimewatch' episode is incredibly funny.",/review/rw0786784/?ref_=tt_urv
