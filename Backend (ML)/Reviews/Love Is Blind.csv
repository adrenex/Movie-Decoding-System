","I have already sent out a message to friends that this is a show to watch. If you missed the first 3 episodes, then spend some time binge watching them. You'll be glad that you did. I like it much better than ""Greenleaf"" which is also on the Oprah network. I give it 2 thumbs up!",/review/rw3575238/?ref_=tt_urv

If you're interested in another predictable array of characters and plot twists, then you will likely be disappointed. Should your soul require retouching, or should the transcendence of blackness be something you dare allow handle you, then Ava DuVernay and Oprah Winfrey's collaboration is well worth your attention.

10 August 2020,joywingfield,2," Great in the beginning, but...
","Sigh -- I really wished the writers would have stayed true to the characters instead of try to please the audience with the ""who's popular and who's not"" B.S. of television writing. The series started off strong, building well-liked yet seriously flawed characters that gave the show a backbone and grit that was refreshing to watch. But as the story played out, we start to see the writers MANIPULATE plots and MANIPULATE dialogue to suit their purposes. This character is popular, so let's give her overwritten scenes and keep her the center of the universe. Unrealistic and completely untrue to the characters, especially as we get into Season 4 when it becomes painfully obvious that Ava and her team idolize Nova, the character who seems to get away with murder yet walks away the victim, the fixer, the smartest person in the room. Really??! And Ralph Angel -- who, if the writers stood their ground and gave us something believable, would have grown emotionally by now, instead keeps pushing aside his own happiness, potentially with a beautiful, intelligent and supportive woman who could have given him the stability he wanted, instead plays the co-dependent schlup who keeps going back to a woman who has lied to him and manipulated her way back into his life. All because the viewers ""like Darla"" and want her to be with Ralph Angel. Never mind that it's unreal and makes no sense. Who wants sense? Let's keep infuriating the audience are rooting for these characters. Let's keep give them HUGE mountains to overcome -- because that's ""drama."" Yeah Right. I've studied screenwriting and I swear, this goes against the grain of genuine storytelling. I will say that I appreciate the acting for the most part (with one unfortunate exception -- Rutina. Completely fake with her one-tear shots.) but overall, the first 3 Seasons were good. I was just hoping -- for once -- that Ava and her writers would let go of themselves (and their alter egos) and let go of the viewers ""favorite characters"" lists and allow the story to Be. Allow the characters to grow. WRITERS, YOU'RE NOT HURTING ANYTHING BY MOVING THE STORY FORWARD. But instead, you choose to be repetitive and stuck. In Season 1, Charley struggles. By Season 4, Charley still struggles. Come on. So disappointing. I will not continue to watch...",/review/rw3575238/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2016,Amari-Sali,9," With a patriarch becoming ill, his family comes together to support one another and in some cases reconnect.
","OWN is a slept on channel. Granted, starting things off with a slew of Tyler Perry productions didn't begin its scripted foray with the best reputation. However, since branching out to different visionaries OWN arguably has gained the type of programming you'd have expected the decades old BET to have had years ago. So with their newest addition, Queen Sugar, arguably Oprah Winfrey and her team have created a solid launch pad for new talent, seasoned talent who deserve steady work, and those in between who may be familiar faces but never got the roles they deserved.",/review/rw3575238/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2016,a-mmerchant,2," Not the same as the book.
","I guess if you have not read the book you will love the show. I had to watch the first episode several times because it was so different. In the book Charlie's husband is dead and she has a daughter not a son. Hollywood was Creole and looked almost white, he does not have a wife but stays on the family's old plantation, Blues mother died from a drug over dose, there is no sister named Nova, this is what really threw me! There are only 2 siblings and Charley is Ralph Angel's half sister. The father has already died so there is no family gathering for a funeral, also Remy is white. And where the hell is Miss Honey, Violets mother, because she is the one that raised Ralph Angel and when Charle and Micah return to Louisiana it's at her house they stay, not Violet's. I am watching the show, and each time I have to remind myself to put the book out of my mind! I just don't understand why so many changes were made! I don't think there are any spoilers here but how can it be when the show is so much more different than book. I was and am really disappointed.",/review/rw3575238/?ref_=tt_urv

13 October 2016,luvleils,10," Excellent Series
","When I first heard of the showings for this series, I was kind of skeptical to watch, since it was initially stated it would be a short series, so I recorded the first two so that I could make sense of it. I'm glad I decided to. The series is GREAT and quite believable. I can never wait until the next showing as it leaves you on the edge of your seat and waiting for the next. This, as with all great series, will be very upsetting to me once it ends. I totally love it am glad that OWN is there and Oprah allows the African American shows to be aired on her network and am sure that other networks will not even give it a second thought. The plot is very intriguing and edgy. The writer is brilliant and the cast are excellent actors/actresses and I love each one of them and everything they bring to the show. Other viewers whom rate as bad and just another black show are confused and of course they are entitles to their own opinion but I highly advise others to view for themselves before looking at other reviews and their negative opinions and decide to watch and get into it. Once again OWN, thanks for the excellent and mind-intriguing shows!!",/review/rw3575238/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2016,muziqlova,10," Refreshing New Series
","I have enjoyed this new series so far and plan to watch the remaining episodes because I'm now hooked. The new faces peeked my interest and did not disappoint in their delivery of the real life complicated humans that we are. I can relate to their perspectives on what is happening to them and I love the New Orleans agriculture background being included as its own character. Even actors I have seen before, like Dondre Whitfield and Tina Lifford, bring new dimensions to the type of characters they are playing so their acting evolution is noticeable. The eye candy of men/women on this show is drool worthy and certainly keeps me engaged with the story line. Hopefully this first series will inspire a continual story line for other seasons to come.",/review/rw3575238/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2021,clomax-1,4," More Sap Than a Sequoia
","Haven't read the book and from reading some of the reviews I guess it's a good thing. No, what excited me was Ava DuVernay being attached to this. I just finished season 4 and for reasons that I don't need to go into, binge watched the whole season. I'm going to say I just wanted to see what happens but then I find there's a season 5 getting ready to drop. Oh well. Anyway I did not graduate from Days of Our Lives University not to recognize soap opera when I see it. With the possible exception of maybe half a dozen scenes out of hundreds there is no authenticity. Sorry. Why is the bar set so low? Major props to the young actor who plays Blue. He earned all four of my stars. As my late husband used to say ""well, at least there's work for some actors""...",/review/rw3575238/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2016,jacobson98,3," Really Bad
","It's like a really bad 1980s prime time soap opera, except most of the characters are black. Every scene features music which is supposed to heighten the drama but instead proves annoying. The characters are stick figures with little depth or interest - the star basketball player, his perfect MBA wife, their perfect children, the MBA wife's brother who's recently out of prison, his adorable son, etc. You will need a scorecard to keep track of the vast cast. The visuals are gorgeous but bear little relationship to the plot. I know I'm supposed to like this because it was created and executive produced by Oprah and Ava DuVernay (the director of Selma). I don't. If you're looking for a new TV show with a black cast, try the far superior Atlanta on FX.",/review/rw3575238/?ref_=tt_urv

19 May 2022,localcdagal,7," What happened?
","I would have rated it a 9, but what happened with season 6? Did the writers go missing? It feels forced and fake. The only storyline that's worth following is Violet and Hollywood. Luckily they're my favorite characters, but still, the season feels like they just phoned it in, like someone said, ok, what are the most generic stories in the news and we'll go with those. I really hope the final season redeems itself after such a dismal season. It would be such a shame for a great show, great characters, to end as they did. It's like everyone (except the actors) just gave up.",/review/rw3575238/?ref_=tt_urv

10 June 2021,SCR508,7," Worth watching, but predictable and stereotypical.
","As a whole, I did like this show. But unfortunately, after a while it became predicable and stereotypical. And the hand of Oprah becomes too visible as the show progresses, clearly showing a desire to portray the plight of black people. No one will deny that black people face an uphill battle in this country, in their everyday life. But in this show, it all becomes too stereotypical. Blacks are shown as bitter and mainly in the victim role; whites are in the roles of nasty land owners, all out to short-change blacks. And of course, there is the quintessential racist cop. And then there is Nova in the role of the black Joan of Arc, also a predictable character. Some of the scenes I found outright disturbing. Such as the scene where Aunt Vi scolds Hollywood (her fiancée) for having invited a white colleague to her house to watch a sports game. Reverse racism, and not very believable in my opinion. Also, the character of Ralph Angel is not very believable. The guy seems to be his own worst enemy, and is in tears half the time we see him. And - is his child (Blue) really his child or not? A chewed-out theme of course - after that, I started to feel that I was watching an African-American soap. Which, of course, is exactly what it is. But a soap with a clear message from Oprah woven into the whole: Blacks have it hard in this country. Again, I definitely believe that there is a lot of truth in that statement. But this show is actually not helping the black cause in that respect. It shows black people as angry; vengeful, cunning, and even racist. Probably not the message Oprah wanted to get across, but it is there nevertheless.",/review/rw3575238/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2017,cherold,7," Somewhat interesting
","I only watch this series because my girlfriend likes it. It's not a bad show at all, but it's also not a series that has really ever sucked me in.

There are some excellent moments, but there are far more pretty good ones.",/review/rw3575238/?ref_=tt_urv

I can hardly wait until the following week after watching current episode/s. I hope it's here to stay. Thanks Oprah! Although it's no surprise that everything you touch turns to gold.
