15 April 2017,lesleyharris30,2," A Mess that Could have been Nostalgic Fun,
","Power Rangers is an atrocious movie with a poorly developed plot and an disinterested cast. I did not have high expectations for this film, but I was a fan of the television series as a child and thought it would be a fun tribute. Instead of that, it takes what made the Power Rangers a hit in the late nineties and forcefully updates it for today's standards, taking itself far too seriously for such a ridiculous property.

","The film opens in the Cenozoic Era with aliens coming to Earth. In New Age fashion, a crystal in the earth creates a life force. We shift to modern times and are introduced to three of the would-be Rangers in detention. We get to know Zack (Ludi Lin) and Trini (Becky G.) a little later. Perhaps the worst thing you can do is to share your innermost secret with a group of teen peers, but that is what they did in order to become a team and save the world vs. a Gold Golem.",/review/rw3672349/?ref_=tt_urv

","With the seemingly endless popularity of superheroes, robots, dinosaurs and gigantic monsters on the big screen, it was only a matter of time before a franchise where superheroes transform into gigantic robotic dinosaurs to battle gigantic monsters would be resurrected. That's right: everyone's favorite half-hour toy commercial from the '90s is back to kick nostalgic butt! The ""Power Rangers"" have been re-booted with a slickly made, big-budget popcorn flick that wants to remind you of your care-free childhood days spent in front of the TV. It also probably wants you to forget the atrocious 1995 film.",/review/rw3672349/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2017,afijamesy2k,2," Power rangers flounders badly with this mess.
","You know when I was 12 years old, I saw power rangers, I thought the first 2 seasons (1993-95) represent splendid action, suspense and real characters, but once season 3 came it all went downhill and this movie is another example at how jumped the shark the power rangers franchise has become, the performances are awful, the story is completely and absolutely confusing, the screenplay is a mess and the editing is a trainwreck, now I love bryan Cranston he's always been a wonderful actor, but he is truly wasted in this one as zordon, a man who help 5 teens with their magical powers and their customs to save angel grove from monsters and the evil rita repulsa (played terribly by Elizabeth banks) and other nonsense, this is just a pathetic and useless attempt to revive the power rangers franchise, it is just awful, this is one of the year's worst films, no offense to my friend who is a power rangers fan, but this movie stinks.",/review/rw3672349/?ref_=tt_urv

",I was a young adult by the time Power Rangers started broadcasting on Fox. I enjoyed the Toei footage that Saban interwove with their newly shot footage for the show. By the Saved-By-The-Bell type footage of the American kids in Power Rangers made the show unwatchable to me. ,/review/rw3672349/?ref_=tt_urv

","In the 90's Saban unleashed onto our homes five teenage heroes dress in multicolored, state of the art underwear. What followed was legacy of aspiring actors fighting men in ashen grey costumes, before turning their attention to unique costumed antagonists that tried to stop their quest. And to this day Power Rangers continues to be a hit amidst the adolescent world as Nickelodeon continues to inspire them to fight as the rainbow warriors. So of course, we needed a movie to really seal the deal, based on the original series that started it all. Robbie K here to cover another movie. Let's get started. ",/review/rw3672349/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was never a huge fan of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"", but I went in, open to trying this film. I was sorely, sorely disappointed. I left this movie thinking, ""This was a *bad* movie!"" Now, there are movies out there, that are absolute garbage, the acting is bad, almost everything is bad. I admit, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, however, there's a lot wrong with it!

27 March 2017,moviemattb,10," A Morphinominal Experience
","It has been three years, since this was first announced as Lionsgate and Saban teamed up to do reboot of ""Power Rangers,"" and now it is finally here for the time in 2017. This movie came out on my Birthday, and got to see it the day after it came out, and all I got to say that ""Power Rangers"" was a morphinominal experience. I had such a fun time with this movie, and really had the pleasure to see a ""Power Rangers"" movie on the big screen like I never had before. I will not spoil this movie for you, because I want you to be surprised by it. Pressing on, the movie tells our five teenagers with attitude as they all come from different backgrounds, when they stumbled across as they found these power coins that gives them their own strengths and found a spaceship as they meet their mentor Zordon and his robotic assistant Alpha 5 as they are chosen to become Power Rangers. While that's going on, we have Rita Repulsa as she has come to Angel Grove to wipe out humanity as our five main heroes must come together as a team in order to save the world. It may be your typical origin story like you have seen a million times before, but it works on its own level. With that said, this is a darn good looking movie, and this does not look like a Michael Bay movie. This is definitely Dean Israelite's movie, the director that brought us ""Project Almanac"" which I really enjoyed that movie, and he really does care on making this movie as he knows how the fan-base really loves ""Power Rangers"" and never acting as a director that really wants a paycheck. I give him huge props for putting a lot care into making this movie, and his direction is absolutely wonderful. The way the movie opens, which I can't spoiled has made my jaw dropped and it was an incredible way to open. The movie's tone is dark, but it still retains the essence of ""Power Rangers,"" where it never forgets the cheese factors. This movie is like a cross between ""Chronicle"" meets ""The Breakfast Club."" I really do love the look of the movie as it is beautifully well filmed, and really has that the kind of atmosphere as it does look gritty, but still has the colors. Brian Tyler's music is epic, and I loved that kind of vibe as it really sounds very sci-fi, but for a coming of age superhero movie. You do hear, the ""Power Rangers"" theme song which it does make it a treat for fans that grew up with the series. The cast in this movie are just fantastic. Bryan Cranston as Zordon is really remarkable as he embodies the character as not only he plays as a wise mentor, but very complex as he is trying to get our heroes to become Power Rangers. Bill Hader as Alpha is really funny, and enjoyable to watch. I do enjoy the redesign of this character as he looks more like an alien robot, instead of some actor in a suit. No disrespect on the original Alpha, just like to point that out. Elizabeth Banks as Rita Repulsa is really funny, but quite menacing at the same time. This Rita does a whole lot more, than just sitting at her palace doing nothing and she really does fight the Rangers. As for our heroes, Dacre Montgomery, Naomi Scott, Ludi Lin, Becky Gomez, and R.J. Cyler have all done such a superb job to have great chemistry together as their acting is very natural and they all do have a charisma. They played flawed teenagers, as they go through real life issues instead of just being goodie goods from the show. They really are the Power Rangers for this generation. I am very pleased for this movie to go deeper into the mythology of Power Rangers as opposed to what the show couldn't do. The action in this movie is pretty good, and so does the special effects. The pacing is never slow, and really does keep me invested with the story, and as well with its characters. The humor, thankfully, doesn't have any of the burp or fart jokes like what happened to the recent ""TMNT"" movies. This has the right kind of humor like what Marvel Cinematic Universe movies have, and it knows when to have fun. I did cry during that one moment in the movie, but once again, cannot spoil it for you. Can't forget about the Zords and the suits as they look really cool in motion. Love them very much. Any flaws? Yes, but they are minored. As much as there was character development for the Rangers, but we kept getting more from Jason, Kimberly and Billy. Sure Zack and Trini do have moments to shine, but you wish there was more to them. Nevertheless, there was enough to care about them. As for Goldar, I thought the design of him looks interesting, and can see why they went with it as it fits within the context of the movie, but you wish he had more of a personality instead of being a run of the mill monster. Sure he is intimidating, but really wanted more from him. So I find this Goldar both good and bad at the same time. I really love this movie, and really do enjoy the aspects of teamwork as it does add to the heart of the movie. ""Power Rangers"" is a loving tribute to the series, and you are going to have a wonderful time at the movies as it appeals to the old and new generation of fans. Kids can enjoy it, and so can adults. This was the best Birthday that I've ever had, and I am giving ""Power Rangers"" a 10 out of 10.",/review/rw3672349/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2018,Leofwine_draca,6," Not bad for a big screen version of a TV series
","POWER RANGERS is a big screen outing for the 1990s TV phenomenon and much better than I expected it would be given the usual quality of a Hollywood blockbusters. It's heavily inspired by the likes of PACIFIC RIM and TRANSFORMERS and yet it has a character all of its own, and it's chock-full of references to the TV series as well as Japanese comic book creations in general. The main good thing about it is that the cast remains likeable despite being young, fresh, and too good looking by half; RJ Cyler is a particular stand-out in this respect. The film gets progressively more and more immersed in CGI as the story progresses, but it remains light and watchable and funny at times. Elizabeth Banks threatens to spoil things with another over the top performance but thankfully doesn't have too much screen time.",/review/rw3672349/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2017,MichaelNontonMulu,7," The 21st Century Reboot of Popular 1990s Kids TV series
","My wife and I were pretty entertained with this movie. It was quite  full of humor and fun all around. Watching the new Power Rangers suits  were also pretty cool, especially if we compared against the suits from  the original TV series back in the 1990s. Of course the special effects  in this movie was pretty amazing. The CGI was done pretty nicely and  neat. Loved the action sequence in the last part of the movie during  the fight between the Rangers and Goldar. Sound effects were good, and  maybe would be more amazing if you see in Dolby Atmos theaters.  After watching it for full 2 hours, the movie duration seemed to be  just nice. It was not too rushed in the process of characters  introduction and the time spent for the training to become the Power  Rangers felt sufficient. It did not take too long or too short, and  still have enough time for the big finale. Overall, the pace of the  movie felt just perfect. The movie had brief moments of jokes that felt  more appropriate for teenagers and not suitable for children. So I feel  that the movie seemed to be aimed more for teenagers rather than for  children, although the original series were actually shown in kids TV.  This is also the reason why a lot of adults also watched this movie to  reminiscent the good fun time when they watched the series (my wife was  a great example of this audience).  In addition, the movie also had some cheesy moments and felt very  light. There was no over-complication of plots, just a simple good old  fashion pop corn movie to be enjoyed without over thinking. For this  kind of movie, people should not expect a deep conversation and various  twists. This is a movie that I feel would provide the fans of the  original series satisfaction. Almost all the characters were there in  the movie, with of course other characters that might join the sequels.  This movie also had some brief interesting scene during the mid end-  credit part. But there was nothing at the very end. So there is no need  to wait till the very last scene if you are in a rush to the wash room.   So if you are looking for a fun light team of superheroes movie based  on the popular 1990s TV series, then you would not be disappointed and  you would be entertained by this. But if you are looking for a heavier  super hero movies from popular comic books like Marvel comics or DC  comics kind, then this might not be your thing. Especially if you are  expecting a heavy drama full of logics kind of movie. The choice is  yours.",/review/rw3672349/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2017,DBLurker,1," Another politically correct Hollywood garbage..

22 March 2017,LloydBayer,4," Power Rangers is nothing but a silly attempt at grabbing a slice of the market share in superhero films.
","You know Hollywood is running out of ideas when a hallmark TV series is made into a big screen production, and then recycled and redecorated with a bigger budget for a new generation. That's perfectly acceptable with franchises like the Jurassic Park films, where sequels are released every decade or so and aimed at a specific cluster of the audience. Power Rangers, on the other hand, has no idea who its target audience is and here's probably why: a suit from Lionsgate (yes, Lionsgate) green- lit the reboot even as the TV series is still being aired, hired screenwriters who wrote superhero films like X-Men: First Class and producers from the Transformers franchise, then hired unknown actors and a newbie director before ending up with a PG-13 fiasco that's neither here nor there.

","I went into this movie with zero expectations. I only watched Power Rangers a little bit when was younger and was never really into it, but, I got to say I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I loved it, I think everyone involved did a very good job. There was a good mix of comedy, action, drama and even some sentimental moments. ",/review/rw3672349/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2017,joelhbk,8," Fun, exciting and fairly satisfying
","Don't go in expecting top notch acting, effects or writing. This movie was never meant to be an example of film making excellence. It's a great teen movie. It combines elements of the drama kids go through nowadays and of course heroism and supernatural fiction. It's like Breakfast Club, Chronicles, Pacific Rim and even a bit of Toy Story 3 all combined. I laughed, teared up, threw my hands in the air, and even though I acknowledge it has its issues I enjoyed the heck out of it. The kids have to work on their acting, tho. The comedy was cheesy here and there but it's Power Rangers so what you expect? Also they touch very relevant issues, like mental illness, peer pressure, bullying, etc. And the importance of friendship and unity. It gets pretty emotional here and there. And it doesn't really piggyback that much on the nostalgia element, but when it does it hits you square in the Yay! bone. Go watch it. It's silly entertainment and cheesy fun at its best. Like the first Transformers. I even like it more than the first Transformers actually.",/review/rw3672349/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2017,mwcrunner,10," Go go Power Rangers! Yeah!
","Excellent here. Very excellent indeed. Just totally awesome. I even like this Power Rangers movie better then the one I've seen as a kid. Looking at the old Power Rangers movie now it's kind of goofy and quirky. This Power Rangers movie however had everything Power Rangers has, except of course Goldar was a giant metamorphosis of gold without that wolf like face. lol. Also Rita Repulsa is way more evil in this then she is in the actual show, since she was just a character swiped from an old Japanese show. lol. Also the Blue Ranger is my favorite. Always has been and always will be. The Megazord in this was wickedly awesome too. We also get to see a cameo of Kimberly and Tommy from the original series. This film had a great cast too. Bryan Cranston as Zordon even. I also like Alpha 5 in this better then him in the old show, cause the old Alpha is kind of dorky. Also Elizabeth Banks was fantastic as Rita Repulsa. It's also nice to see Zordon having a backstory of when he was a Power Ranger. I also know there's gonna be a sequel to this cause we all saw Tommy's jacket at the end. Also the Putties were more intimidating in this then they were in the original show. Yep this movie has everything the Power Rangers should have. Plenty of action, adventure, laughs and pure of heart. 10 out of 10 for this.",/review/rw3672349/?ref_=tt_urv
