3 December 2022,Xstal,3," The Eternal Saunter...
","There's a hotel that's quite vacant and disturbed, full of ghosts that haunt themselves, it's quite absurd, lots of creepy mist and fog, a really, really lovely dog, and a receptionist presents with some discord. A daughter with her mother settle in, proceed to babble on, the dialogue's quite thin, if you'd made a reservation, you'd need more than just salvation, if you had the room next door, double or twin. There's little to engage or get you thinking, as events unfold, or don't, you'll just start blinking, then your eyelids slowly close, just like Louis you will repose, and into slumber, start to fall, gradually sinking.",/review/rw8720898/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,jtindahouse,4," Never justifies its existence
",'The Eternal Daughter' is listed as a mystery drama. The only mystery I had an hour into the film was what exactly the point of me watching it was supposed to be. The film has no plot. It has no intrigue. It has no purpose to exist. This was a very disappointing experience.,/review/rw8720898/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2022,imseeg,4," A horror/mystery movie that isnt horror nor is it mysterious. It is unintentionally quite laughable though...
","Yeah, it's wintertime, let's produce a CHEAPLY made ""horror/mystery"" movie, that'll attract viewers. NOT.",/review/rw8720898/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,abeeralhossary,1," A horror film gone wrong!
","To read that this film got two nominations in a film festival made me eager to watch, but honestly I wasted my time watching it!",/review/rw8720898/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2022,slabihoud,7," Good drama, but missed opportunities!
","A film with Tilda Swinton is always worth watching and so is this one! Though I have to say that I expected a little bit more after I read about the film at the Viennale (Vienna International Film Festival). What irritated me were the tags ghost story, supernatural, spooky and so on. Not that I expected a real horror movie, far from it. But not such a lame attempt of a ghost story.",/review/rw8720898/?ref_=tt_urv

5 December 2022,biljao258,3," I'm so, so sorry, Louis
","Louis, the casting director was so inspired when you were given a key role in this movie. Your talent really shone through as you captured ""affection"", ""endearingness"" and ""faithfulness"" - you also really nailed ""valor"" as you chased the 'ghost' (?) down the hall. How were you to know that the writer/director based the movie on a single concept story with some rather obvious twists. And then even resorted to several hackneyed 'gothic horror' tropes. Yikes, even a big-name star was not enough. But them's the breaks of the movie industry, Louis. Even a talented actor such as yourself can end up in what some may see as a turkey of a movie. But hopefully, this will lead to bigger and better roles for you.",/review/rw8720898/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2023,killercharm,3," eternal atmos
","All atmos and no fear. I love me some Tilda Swinton but this is not that time. True to the 3rd decade style this is a glacially slow ""horror."" I do believe it has one good scene and that is at the end. Which means two hours of waiting for something. As lovely as it is to look at and listen to Ms. Swinton and doubly so when she uses bad grammar, it's not enough. Especially when we are supposed to be surprised about, well, the thing that wasn't a surprise at all. The music gets to be tedious as well. I just didn't see anything as haunted. The daughter might be haunted about her treatment of her mother, but who isn't. We're all haunted by things we can't change.",/review/rw8720898/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2022,Nobody_Nothing_Nowhere,1," Drab Bland Pretentious Nonsense
","I feel like I must be living in some kind of alternate reality because it's got a 95% from critics and I thought it was awful. Boring. Not because it's slowburn, but because it never burns at all.",/review/rw8720898/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2023,simonmattera,1," pay your grandma a visit. much more exciting!
","Yeah its about grief and all. But honestly, this was painful and makes you think to use your time more wisely. Also the double role gives it right away that she checks in alone- no surprise or plotwist there. At least they could have made the dialogues more intriguing. Nope- u don't get much out of those either. The intentional faded colors, makes you wanna correct the contrast constantly, its so bleek the whole time. It's definitely the worst movie i have seen with swinton in it. Normally i consider her as a guarantee of good films cause she choses her roles wisely. Don't know what drove her to do this project???",/review/rw8720898/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2023,dottydew,4," Great Sleeper or snoozer rather
","Knocked me right out cold. I liked the atmosphere but whoever created the synopsis did an injustice to this film. I went into it thinking I was settling into watching a good old fashioned ghost story. So excited when it started, had my snacks, tea, and was all cozy. Loved the spooky atmosphere and waited and watched ... Where's the ghost? Nodded off a few minutes, came to ... where's the ghost? Nodded off cold and came to at the end when the eternal daughter is celebrating her mother's birthday.",/review/rw8720898/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I was a kid, and we would visit ny grandma, we'd sit and chat to her, but I was too young to have anything to say, and often there would be long quite pauses where you'd just here the ticking clock. The decor and furniture was well out of date. That bored dusty feeling is exactly what I got from this film.",/review/rw8720898/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2022,dhuntlinux,1," Huh?
","1:32 I will never get back. That's what I'm grieving. Let's explore that. Kept waiting for something to happen, but it never did. Filmed like an old Vincent Price horror with absolutely no actual horror. I feel like there are more and more of these non-story movies being made and praised. I guess I'm just not cerebral enough to get it. We need to have a new rating system that alerts the viewer, you are about to go no where so sit back and wait to be wholey disappointed as you wait patiently for a plot to develop that never does until suddenly you're staring at two words and left questioning... THE END.",/review/rw8720898/?ref_=tt_urv

7 December 2022,lizshotter,5," Seeing double
","If you're expecting a horror or supernatural film keep looking, you won't find it here. This appears to be more of an exploration on the horror of grief, contencious patental relationships and impending old age than anything else. It's likely you will guess any kind of twist but it's safe to say it's somewhat obvious. There are some weird continuity issues and holes in the story, such as if the mother isn't there how is she having conversations with staff, walking their dog etc which meant a lot of the time i felt confused. I wonder if this was Tindas way of exploring grief with her deceased parent as this seems to be personal exploration. Sometimes I felt as if I was invading by watching this and maybe that's the whole purpose as the sense of isolation and sadness was accurately portrayed.",/review/rw8720898/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,bertrandma,5," Gothic language games
","As any of the reviews on here make clear, if you are looking for a standard supernatural or slasher fare, keep looking: this is a psychological thriller quite far out on the psychological end of the spectrum, or to be entirely fair, it is not much of a thriller at all. What it does, and does well enough, is memorialize an upper-class English femininity that has largely vanished--genteel, affectionately distant, articulately banal, and decked in Liberty prints.",/review/rw8720898/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,brentsbulletinboard,6," A Slowburn That Never Catches Fire
","One effective way to tell a tale of suspense is to employ the atmospheric slowburn approach, one that quietly but chillingly sizzles as it leads up to what is eventually (and supposedly) a startling revelation. However, writer-director Joanna Hogg's attempt at pulling this off in her latest offering falls short, protractedly smoldering but never really catching fire. When a middle-aged English filmmaker and her aging mother (dual roles played by Tilda Swinton) pay a hoped-for nostalgic visit to a vintage country hotel that was once their extended family's manor house, they set their sights on their stay giving them a chance to relive fond memories and to resolve certain aspects of their complex, sometimes-distant relationship (an irony given the devoted daughter's earnest attempt at being a loving, dutiful caretaker). But, almost from the moment they arrive, things don't play out as anticipated; events unfold with a surreal, unfathomable awkwardness in a setting befitting a gothic ghost story. So what's going on here? That's what the film seeks to explain. Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot to tell here, the story ultimately being more tedious than suspenseful, frequently relying on astonished reaction shots to things that mysteriously go bump in the night to carry the story forward. And, when ""the big reveal"" finally comes, it emerges more with a whimper than a bang (especially since it's not particularly difficult to figure out what's coming anyway). While the film is stylistic to a fault in terms of skillfully creating a suitable ambiance, the accompanying narrative is rather anemic by comparison. It's almost as if the storyteller is spinning a vague yarn, one told with kid gloves, a nagging frustration for those expecting something with more of a bite to it. While there's a definite purpose behind this, given the picture's attempt at exploring elements of the mother-daughter relationship typically not addressed in films like this, this set of restrained attributes nevertheless inhibits this offering from ever developing much of an edge to it (yawn). To the film's credit, it features yet another fine performance by Swinton, but it's regrettable that she's not given much to work with. And, even with its comparatively short 1:36:00 runtime, the picture somehow manages to seem like it's far longer. Indeed, in this case, ""eternal"" is something applicable to more than just the wording of its title.",/review/rw8720898/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2022,FilmFanatic2023,7," Headline: ""The Eternal Daughter"" - A Compelling and Eerie Exploration of Family Relationships and the Passage of Time
","I recently had the opportunity to watch ""The Eternal Daughter"" and was struck by the film's eerie atmosphere and strong performances from Tilda Swinton and Carly-Sophia Davies. The film follows Julie, a filmmaker, as she travels with her mother to a creepy country estate to research her latest project. The setting and mood of the film are deeply unsettling, and the way time is portrayed as porous adds to the overall sense of unease.",/review/rw8720898/?ref_=tt_urv
