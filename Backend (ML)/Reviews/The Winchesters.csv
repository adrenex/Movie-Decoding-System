22 September 2018,roblesar99,8," Lanthimos Delivers... But The Ending Could Use Some Work
","Sumptuous and stunning. With THE FAVOURITE, director Yorgos Lanthimos delivers his best film yet - one that works as both a historical drama and a sex comedy that features beautiful cinematography courtesy of Robbie Ryan (Lanthimos really loves him some fisheye lenses) and gorgeous costume design courtesy of Sandy Powell (just give her the Oscar already because wow). Lanthimos, working for the first time with a screenplay that he didn't co-write, deals primarily with themes of power and the way it impacts the three women at the center of the film. Despite not having had a hand in writing the screenplay, Lanthimos seems to be in his wheelhouse, crafting a stirring yet (darkly) humorous rumination on humankind's innate desire to posses power, whether it be political, sexual, or anything in between. Granted, Lanthimos is also working with some of the most talented actresses working today and the big three (Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, and Emma Stone) all deliver some of the best work of their career. As crazy as it might sound, however, and despite Colman's Best Actress win at Venice for her portrayal of Queen Anne, this is Stone's film. I'm already frustrated by the fact that she will be campaigned in the Best Supporting Actress field despite the fact that the film wholly follows her arc. That's not to take anything from Colman, whose performance is likely the most impressive of the three, but I do feel it's something to take note of.",/review/rw4811012/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2019,FrenchEddieFelson,9," Wow!!
","In early 18th century, the friendship between Anne, first Queen of Great Britain and Lady Sarah Churchill, the wife of the Duke of Marlborough, was very close and then deteriorated because of their differing political views and the growing influence of another favorite, Abigail Masham. The film focuses on the rivalry between these 2 women, Abigail and Sarah: lousy tricks, alliances, treacheries, ground shiftings, sex, ... Everything is allowed to obtain the favors of the queen!",/review/rw4811012/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2019,TheLittleSongbird,9," Unsettling favouritism
","'The Favourite' from the day it came out quickly became one of my most anticipated films. Mainly for the critical acclaim, the vast awards attention and the talented cast (namely Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz). Anybody who has seen and liked Yorgos Lanthimos' previous films, including 'The Lobster', would also find another reason to be psyched about seeing it. Interesting furthermore for seeing a monarch and reign/era not explored an awful lot on film and actually even in general.",/review/rw4811012/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2019,SnoopyStyle,8," delicioius
","English Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is fighting a war in France. Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) is her favorite courtesan and is the power behind the throne. Her cousin Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives looking for a job after her family had fallen in status. Sarah looks down upon her and sends her to be a maid. She is being whipped when Sarah suddenly needs her to alleviates the Queen's gout pains. Leader of the opposition, Mr. Harley (Nicholas Hoult), is pushing for an immediate peace treaty while Sarah uses her power over the Queen to raise taxes to continue the war led by her husband at the front.",/review/rw4811012/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2019,andrewroy-04316,8," Funny and with extremely memorable characters, The Favourite is a fun and weird character-driven period drama
","While Lanthimos continues his eccentric and absurdist filmmaking tendencies, The Favourite is still an easy one to get behind and think deeply about. The premise is essential to all of the plot machinations: in early 18th century England, we are in Queen Anne's court, where political power and maneuvering is everything. Queen Anne is an entertaining central figure, as while all politics revolve around her and she can do what she wants, she also seems like a puppet and easily influenced. The real heart of the movie is Abigail's character arc and her rivalry with Sarah. Abigail, played wonderfully by Emma Stone (who in my opinion should've been considered the lead actress, not Olivia Colman), comes from a family who was wealthy but fell far, and comes to her cousin Sarah looking for a job in the palace. Sarah is intelligent, knowledgeable in the political game, and the Queen's closest adviser. Abigail is immediately who we root for, as an outsider ready to work hard and earn a successful role near the Queen. We see her develop from believing that the best way to rise is through honor and loyalty, but quickly sees that everyone is playing political games and becomes ruthless in outstripping Sarah for the Queen's affection. The script is phenomenal and treats the characters very consistently but never one-dimensionally, by clearly showing their motivations but also portraying them realistically as humans. The humor really works, from the absurdist touches like the duck races to the funny dialogue, like when Sarah tells the Queen she looks like a badger and the Queen agrees. The ending, while an ambiguous one, I think symbolizes the Queen's loneliness and struggle for control, as that final shot of Abigail rubbing her leg fades into rabbits. There seems to be a lot going on, but really it's a fun character drama between these three players in an extremely politically charged and power driven society, and particularly Abigail's development and increasing ruthlessness within that framework. On all of those counts, it's very successful as a film, balancing coherence and intelligent filmmaking with innovation and quirks as Lanthimos always does. Every scene builds up and further develops the characters, and none contradict or seem meaningless, which is a sign of a great movie and great script.
Purely for my own future memory, I'm copying down a line I thought was really funny: ""Obviously you have chosen to keep the particulars of your dismissal from me. I shall leave a gap in the conversation for you to remedy that.""",/review/rw4811012/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2018,andrewestrella,," The Absurdity of This Film Was Too Much for Me
","Let me preface my review with me saying that I have never had a film experience where I have been genuinely uncomfortable in. I have watched The Human Centipede Series, Saw, and plenty of other gory cinema that has hardly made me cringe. But for some odd reason, The Favourite made me cringe and feel sick half of the time.",/review/rw4811012/?ref_=tt_urv

","Some movies are born to be darlings of the critics. Take ""experimental"" director Lanthimos, lately very much in favour, thanks to puzzling movies such as ""The lobster"" and give him a script whatsoever. You may bet the critics will applaude the results, perhaps also thanks to the abundance of salacious, politically-correct scenes.",/review/rw4811012/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2018,Gresh854,8," Yorgos Lanthimos Takes On Old-Fashioned England
","The Favourite was not what I expected. This isn't classic Yorgos Lanthimos, this is a whole new, more whimsical Yorgos Lanthimos, approached parallel to his usual sinister, vexing, and twisted spirit. In full hindsight, this more comedic and less calamitous manner ended with me completely and whole-heartedly digging it. And when I say, The Favourite is more cheer and juvenile than his previous work, I'm not inferring that Lanthimos loses his infamous psychologically poignant gift in this, I'm just inferring that it's done in a much more subtle way, hidden by cynical buffoonery.",/review/rw4811012/?ref_=tt_urv

","After having seen and become a fan of the very first series on Masterpiece Theater The First Churchills, I was anxious to see the different slant The Favourite
had on what is an enlargement of the last years of that story. As The First
Churchills was based on Winston Churchill's biography of his ancestor The Duke
of Marlborough it was as expected slanted toward Sarah Jennings Churchill.",/review/rw4811012/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2019,ccrisss,3," Believe all the negative reviews.
","I was excited to watch this but found myself annoyed throughout the film.
The soundtrack is absolutely irritating you'd want to mute just so it would finally stop grating on your nerves.
I liked the 3 lead actresses, so I gave them a star each, but that's about it.
Everything else is just BAD. and I mean really bad.
By the end, I was seething inside. It's like the rage you feel when you've been duped. Because what an awful awful movie.
DO NOT be fooled by the glowing reviews. You've been warned.",/review/rw4811012/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2018,richard-1787,2," Don't waste your time or money on this one
","Throughout this movie characters vomit. While I wouldn't say that it will make you do the same, I certainly found it deadly dull.
And pretentious.
The story has some basis in history. It takes place near the end of the reign of England's Queen Anne, around 1711-1713, during which time the War of Spanish Succession-the war between England and France that is mentioned on occasion-was drawing near its end. The Queen's husband, Prince George of Denmark, had died in 1708, after having gotten her pregnant 17 times - enough to justify switching romantic interest away from men for any woman. Sarah, the Duchess of Marlborough, who had already managed to become the Queen's friend, and-at least in this movie-something more than that as well, has come to exert real influence over the Queen because of her willingness to play to the monarch's desire for affection from other women. As the movie opens, Abigail Hill, a distant relative of Sarah's, arrives at court with the hope of getting preferment there. She sees how Sarah receives favor from the Queen, and decides that she can play that game as well if it will allow her to advance at court. Lesbian intrigue follows.
The costumes are fine, there is some intriguing lighting, and early in the movie some different types of lenses provide unusual shots. The acting, to the extent that the women in these roles get to act, is all fine.
But, for me, this was a succession of too-often unexplained scenes and strange behavior that I found pretentious in the extreme. I can understand that, if they have to consume a steady diet of play-by-the-numbers action movies, film critics get excited over something different and not formulaic. But for me different and not predictable does not, in itself, produce a movie interesting enough to hold my attention for two hours. I found myself nodding off on occasion-and it was only the middle of the afternoon-because none of it held my interest.
Nor would I say that is movie strikes a blow for lesbians. The characters aren't interesting, so you don't really care about their relationships, which are presented as manipulative rather than romantic. The Queen never gets to say that the relationships she has with women are more fulfilling, or at least less stressful, than the marriage she had with Prince George.
I just didn't see why the director wanted to resurrect this element of history in this way.",/review/rw4811012/?ref_=tt_urv

31 January 2019,phd_travel,4," Off putting bunch but people like that are around today
",This modern take on the favourite ladies of Queen Anne is a part of history not often shown and this movie is partly fictionalised. I guess they didn't want to do a BBC type movie so they added lots of profanity some nudity and modern dialog. Sometimes it makes things lively but often it was jarring just like the classical music mixed with some droning rubbish sounds. The theme of favourites jousting for the affections of the queen is oddly still relevant - there are actually people I known who behave like this today.,/review/rw4811012/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2019,n-kefala,9," A charmingly quirky film
","Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone are both brilliantly witty and Colman's performance is nothing less but sublime. The three leads are able to hold a fascinating performance that is difficult to achieve. Yorgos Lanthimos retains a pessimistic view of human nature but all goes down with a touch of British glam, as he pushes the idea of the capricious queen through the far reaches of comedy and almost into tragedy. With its brilliant and dramatic script, the sharp dialogues, the great performances, the wonderful production design contributions and a beautiful cinematography, may be for more open-minded audiences, but it's such a charmingly quirky film and is my front-runner for the Best Picture Oscar. nikisreviews.gr",/review/rw4811012/?ref_=tt_urv

29 February 2020,jamiedarlow-37510,4," Uncomfortable and a bit boring despite its talent
","The script for this star-studded period comedy-drama has been in circulation since the late 90s and has finally been greenlit with writers Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara and Director Yorgos Lanthimos. The setting is early 18th Century England (filmed at Hatfield House in Hertfordshire!) Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is in rule and assisted by her close friend and confidante Sarah (Rachel Weisz). A new servant arrives, Abigail (Emma Stone), who starts to work up the ranks and gain the trust of Queen Anne. And so begins a dangerous rivalry. This is the third film I have seen by Lanthimos and both films previously were completely different sides of the spectrum for me. I really didn't like Dogtooth; although it was an interesting premise, I found its rough edges to be too rough and isolating which I guess is the point of the film but not for me. On the other hand, I absolutely loved The Lobster which was a genuinely brilliant, funny yet darkly savage look at a dystopian future. The Favourite leans more towards the former for me; it felt strangely uninvolving despite the good performances and I found myself just looking at the screen rather than being engaged as it went on. There are some brilliant moments though particularly thanks to Olivia Colman who is stunningly great as always; the close up camera shots of her are so good, portraying the pathos and sadness of the character of Anne extremely well. Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz are also great as ever and have a lot of fun in the roles of consistently trying to outsmart the other. There is a brutal moment involving self-mutilation with a book that reminded me of the most shocking moments in The Lobster. The ending frames are also hauntingly amazing; edited beautifully by Yorgos Mavropsaridis! Lanthimos is a master of uncomfortable atmosphere and brooding darkness which can go either way; in the case of The Favourite it's a bit of a mixed bag. When it works particularly during the eerily quiet moments, it's really good but when it's uncomfortably bizarre which is the majority of the time it's a bit of a numb watch",/review/rw4811012/?ref_=tt_urv
