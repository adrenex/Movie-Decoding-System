15 August 2003,prose,," `Spooks' delivers....
","I read all the hype in advance of this program being shown on ABC-TV in Australia, and thought: yeah, yeah, show me something different.  Maybe it's not too different, but it does deliver.  I was a bit bored inititally by the straight delivery of MI-5 characters, and how terribly seriously they take their jobs.  Matthew MacFadyen is a fine choice for Tom Quinn - he's big and tall, straight-faced, and very, very serious.  Keeley Hawes is also very well cast, and eminently believable.",/review/rw1450379/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2003,sgspires,," Intelligent work on intelligence work
","I've seen these on A&E in America and from the first I was hooked. The pressure cooker atmosphere and the modern day dot-com look puts this show about ""counter intelligence"" on another level than today's so called spy shows.",/review/rw1450379/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2002,The Horseman,," One of the best things on British TV
","Spooks, is quite frankly, bloody excellent. It seems to have learnt all the tricks that the best of American thrillers (e.g. '24') have picked up, and uses them to the best of their abilities. The acting, especially from McFadden, is likewise excellent (unlike many other similar programs, Spooks doesn't attempt to make the characters whiter-than-white. They're likeable, just not perfect). It also has the bravery to use storylines that are shocking, but are what make it the best.",/review/rw1450379/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2006,djames42,10," Best show on television
","Just finished the last episode of series three, and was reminded why this is my favourite show of all time. I think the comparisons to 24 are quite unfair--they both deal with terrorism, but the similarities end there. Spooks is far more cerebral, and spends more effort on character and plot development.",/review/rw1450379/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2003,matildamother,," Wow!
",I absolutely LOVE this series.  I got hooked with the episode involving the deep fryer and I've been hopelessly addicted ever since.  This series is incredibly suspenseful and involving and I cannot wait to see what they come up with every week.  The acting and writing is superb.  I love this genre and I'm glad to see someone is doing something worthwhile with it.  Highly recommended!!,/review/rw1450379/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2005,terrencesmith666,," Commissioned by MI5?
","Spooks has been waiting to be made ever since Fleming's Bond started the wild-fantasy spy genre. This is an attempt at a realistic depiction of the activities and lives of MI5 agents, in the way that The Bill or Casualty depict those professions. Sometimes this gives an eerie feeling of the series having been commissioned by MI5 in order to get an influx of new, preferably ethnic-minority, recruits.. but the plots are always riveting, dangerous and violent so it makes for great TV.",/review/rw1450379/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2005,ccjameshenry,," Absolutely Brilliant
","Spooks is, without doubt, the tensest and most dramatic (for better or for worse) drama on TV at the moment, season III is especially brilliant and with season IV scheduled to start next year i am itching with anticipation. However, there is something for everything as the story line also focuses on the relationships within spooks meaning that there is an ongoing story as well as a story per episode. SHEER BRILLIANCE The actors are brilliant and i am sure spooks will go down in history as one of the best dramas, kiss BOND goodbye a more realistic, better story is here. Enjoy one of the most memorable security-service dramas ever!",/review/rw1450379/?ref_=tt_urv

3 April 2011,ivko,6," decent British spy thriller
","Entertaining show about the British security service MI-5 with a writing and editing style similar to '24', but typically with one or two episode story arcs instead of season long plots. The characters are well created and nicely fleshed out with skills and personal foibles, but do seem to have disturbingly short lifespans. Politics in the show are rather conservative at the beginning of the series (which started shortly after 9/11), but gradually begin to include a lot of lefty 'new world order' conspiracy stuff as the show progresses and the Iraq war became increasingly unpopular around the world. Like all shows of this type, it portrays England as having a shockingly high rate of terrorist attacks and far too many caches of surface to air missiles floating around inside it's borders.",/review/rw1450379/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2003,alc1973,," a nice addition to american television, and a great alternative to the mind numbing onslaught of reality television
","This show (titled MI-5) just landed on Tuesday nights at 10 pm, with many encores throughout the week on the A&E channel.  For those of you who are not familiar with the american channels, A&E runs various biography shows, a few other british shows, among others.  To put it another way, when I watched it, there were no commercials for beer or fast food.  It is a smart interesting show without all the flash of ""24"" or ""alias"", which are among my favorite shows.  In the first episode there was little background on the characters, which is very different for american television audiences.  I felt like I had missed a few episodes.  The show did not spend as much time on the tech stuff either, but somehow that didn't seem so important as a great story unfolded during the hour.  Very little publicity about this show has made it out there, and I only hope that enough people will stick it out and give the show enough of an audience to continue, lest we be stuck with only more of the summer dreck from the big networks.",/review/rw1450379/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2007,Thorsten-Krings,10," Great show
","Spooks is certainly one of the best shows ever made for TV. One of the reasons is the basic principle that nothing is clear cut black and white but that every single character really is very ambivalent. So on the one hand there are ""heroes"" (otherwise it would be boring) but on the other hand the role of the security services is not glorified. That intelligent outlook makes is good watching. Apart from that the story lines are on the one hand believable (I wouldn't go as far as to say realistic as the show keeps the number of people involved in any given case to an unrealistically low number and the cases happen one after the other) but also original. The standard of writing is very high and the authors stay clear of spy story stereotypes. There really are no flat characters in this show which makes it really delightful and no character is safe which adds to the suspense. In season three basically all three main characters which did carry the show over a number of years disappear. It is done again in a believable way and the three new characters give the show a new (although not necessarily better or worse) dimension by their MI 6 past in the middle east and the addition of a husband/ wife team. And again, the Thin Man stereotype is avoided. Personally I preferred the McFadyen character because he was less of a stereotype (essentially he was really uncool) as Penry-Jones's who acts against his posterboy image. He is a great actor but his looks really are in the way of being taken seriously. But you can't blame him for that. Generally speaking I find it amazing that they manage to tell an exciting, multi layered and ultimately satisfying story in the 60 minutes format. Spooks is also one of the few TV shows that's visually innovative.",/review/rw1450379/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2006,lbeatles551,10," From Across The Pond
","I've been hooked and reeled. I absolutely love MI-5/Spooks. I rented all the available series and I crave for more. I'm anxiously waiting for 2005 to become available. The characters are unique and intriguing. The story lines are complex and luring. The acting is top form. As far as I'm concerned nothing here in the U.S. comes close. We had Mission Impossible (covert missions and fancy gadgetry) but MI-5 is fathoms richer, and smart. I'm a loyal fan of Keeley Hawes first finding her in Tipping the Velvet and recently viewed Our Mutual Friend. She's an outstanding actress and her MI-5 colleagues perform with such command of the art. As far as I'm concerned the BBC can do no wrong.",/review/rw1450379/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2012,spkelsekladden,3," scary
","When i watched the first episode of the first season, i thought this was brilliant.But after watching half of season two I'm just bored. If this is how the real MI5 is run i would be seriously worried. They act like bloody fools. The show has been compared to the American 24 I'm not sure if thats is a good thing or a bad.",/review/rw1450379/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2002,brotherfallout,," Very, very enjoyable
","This is one of the better British TV thrillers to emerge in a few good years. What initially attracted me was another varied acting choice by Matthew MacFayden, but on watching I found myself compelled. It does suffer from some unrealism, but the characters are so interesting, the plots so varied, it makes up for it. And yes, yes, it does rip off from 24, but it hasn't tried to hide it, so in my opinion that's a good thing, seeing as 24 used some of the most innovative effects. Also, some of the secondary casting, such as Hugh Laurie's nasty Jools and Peter Firth's big boss Harry. Also, guest appearances by Anthony Head and Tim Piggot-Smith just add to the strength of this show. I eagerly await the second series, after the excellent end of the first. If you are interested in MacFayden's performance (he is one of the strongest new English talents) then check out the worthy The Way We Live Now (where he plays a cad) and the absolutely wonderful Perfect Strangers.",/review/rw1450379/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2006,vhs1999,10," Very Realistic and very scary spooks is the best show the UK have produced
","I have been watching spooks ever since it has been broadcast here in Australia. Spooks is very realistic and follows story lines that are real close to real world events. Over the past four seasons spooks has gone through many changes and has in season 3 lost there three main leads Tom,Zoe,Danny and replaced by Adam,Ros,Zaf who still make the show just as exciting more to the point realistic and serious. These episodes are very Controversial and have got a lot of suspense but if you are looking for excitement suspense and even some character based plots well you have come to the right place,good choice of show. i would just like to say keep it up england your doing a great job.

25 August 2008,JSC-2,7," Spooks: The deterioration of a great show
","The early seasons of Spooks, a well-produced BBC action-drama about a small band of MI-5 agents serving to protect the UK, provided compelling entertainment. Giving the writers some latitude in developing plots that had the same team of MI-5 saving Britain each week from a variety of home grown and foreign militants, the show had excellent production values, good story lines and developed the characters' background to help create audience empathy. Led by Matthew Macfadyen and Peter Firth, the actors had good chemistry and, occasionally, the plot raised interesting questions about the dilemmas faced by domestic intelligence agencies.

",At times this is very silly but overall it's a top notch drama and looking back on it now one can see how it anticipated real world issues before they hit the headlines. It's at its best in the superb first two seasons with Matthew Macfayden and Keeley Hawes. Peter Firth is outstanding throughout.,/review/rw1450379/?ref_=tt_urv

","From watching a few episodes from BBC online, I was totally hooked. I then bought 9 seasons of Spooks and watching one to two episodes a day. What I love about it, is that it doesn't try and glorify the roles of Mi5 agents, it feels so realistic, and well it touches on topics that you feel wow, what our governments are probably doing to protect our country and keep us safe that we will most likely never know about.",/review/rw1450379/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm through S6. S5 and S6 could pass for Iranian propaganda. Is it? I have to wonder because in this world of spies and counter spies the only good pure and angelic people on the planet are the Iranians. Their motives are pure, they're always the victims and they're always victorious against the Satanic and dastardly forces of the evil Jew/Zionist/American/Crusader/Globalist machine. The only thing that stops the peaceful peace loving Persians of peace from being stomped out of existence is the well meaning if somewhat incompetent bumbling of MI-5.

31 August 2018,aldebaran68,8," Brilliant Series 1-8, lousy 9-10...
","I really love this programme from Series 1 to 8. Then for 9-10 it just seemed to lose its soul and its way. They should have stopped it after Ros died. 
i really hated the way the made Richard Armitages character so ambivalent, ambiguous, traumatised, and confused. The guy should have been in a loony bin, not in charge of section D. 
How is Spooks MI5 supposed to manage the 1001 threats to NatSecurity when its head of operations is running around with his own aghenda(s)? 
In fact IMHO Series 9 was almost entirely about Richard Armitage's Lucas North, and hardly at all about the plots and story lines It just got ridiculous in the end. 
Then Series 10 was just plain...dire. I'm struggling to get through it. 
After Series 8 I just couldn't empathise with any of the characters. Harry and Ruth were constantly 'on and off'. When Lucas North finally died i almost cheered! That's how far Spooks had descended into a confused mess. 
I shall remember Spooks from series 1-8 with fondness, and maybe get te DVDs in. The rest I shall ignore. I give it 10/10 for 1-8. Then a 3 or 4 for 9-10. So 8 as a compromise.",/review/rw1450379/?ref_=tt_urv
