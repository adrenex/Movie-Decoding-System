","We catch up to most of the ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" characters in this nostalgic short. The wedding of Charles & Carrie's daughter to the daughter of Fiona may be done for politically correct reasons, but it's still great to see the old cast, even David (David Bower) who has not been on-screen in a while.",/review/rw6528454/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2022,itwaslikemagic,7," A quick and entertaining look into the future of the FW&AF gang
","Written by Richard Curtis and with a runtime of only twelve minutes, we're invited to the wedding of Miranda (Lily James), who is the daughter of Charles (Hugh Grant) and Carrie (Andie McDowell), to Faith (Alicia Vikander), daughter of Charles's best friend and one time admirer, Fiona (Kristin Scott Thomas). Written and filmed for Comic Relief's Red Nose Day, which took place on March 15th of this year, we get a quick glimpse into where the characters from Four Weddings and a Funeral are today. (Beware of potential spoilers below I guess?)",/review/rw6528454/?ref_=tt_urv

",It was wonderful to see nearly the entire cast of Four Weddings and a Funeral back together again. The only thing that would have made this perfect was finding a way to work in Simon Callow.,/review/rw6528454/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2019,Horst_In_Translation,6," Red Nose Day follows up on another very famous film
","""One Red Nose Day and a Wedding"" is the official sequel to ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". This was made for Red Nose Day 2019 and I think 2 years ago the yfollowed up on ""Love Actually"" and this year on the occasion of its 25th anniversary, it's time for a fifth wedding. They got Oscar nominee Richard Curtis, the original writer, back for that and, on a side-note he also wrote LA. And Mike newell directs again too. This one runs for under 15 minutes and you can split it into two parts basically. The first is the wedding and the second is a speech by Hugh Grant('s character) and of course they got many key players back from Four Weddings. Fittingly into the days of political correctness, they initiated a same-sex wedding here and the two women atg the altar are played by Lily James and Oscar winner Alicia Vikander, both certainly very stunning. The priest in charge is Rowan Atkinson, yep. Sadly this is not as funny overall as when he was in the audience of a funeral, another RND production from a while ago I think. But his clumsiness with two women in front of him was still enjoyable. And him being called a clown before the ceremony even begins was hilarious too. I must say I (still) haven't seen 4WaaF, but even if this short here was fine, I also did not get too curious to watch it immediately. Maybe I'll get the chance at some point on the big screen. I like Grant more and more I must say the older he gets despite not really being a huge fan in his younger years. In his recent film next to meryl Streep, he was marvellous and I hope he finally gets an Oscar nomination at some point now being close to 60. How time flies. Overall, this was a good little movie. Also some great song selections here, not only because of the wonderful Sam Smith's inclusion. Go check it out. If you have seen and loved the original, this one here is basically a must-see I suppose.",/review/rw6528454/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was never a fan of the film Four weddings and a funeral, to me it is an overated film. But after watching the 2019 comic relief sketch, I have gained a little appreciation fo the original.
I won't spoil the plot, for those who have not seen the sketch, but be prepared to cringe and squirm in your chair at the politcally correct twist. Apart from anything else, the sketch was just not funny.
The only positive aspect of the production came later on in the sketch, when they made references to Charlotte Coleman's character Scarlet. Never try to recapture the past, it rarely works out. This sketch is living proof of that.",/review/rw6528454/?ref_=tt_urv
