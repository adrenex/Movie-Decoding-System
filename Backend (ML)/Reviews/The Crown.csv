27 March 2013,selffamily,9," Excellent series
","What a wonderful series; I had heard about it but never seen it and finally the chance to hire it came about. I had my doubts, having been scarred by the rector's wife a couple of weeks ago, but this is a totally different kettle of fish, and funny, serious, and real. Great acting, wonderful characters and gentle humour. And upbeat!! The vicar is a highly likable character and he brings a reality to the fact of a man with faith that many series would scorn. Here he is not a villain, but a man trying to do the best he can with the lot he has chosen. It's refreshing to see a clergyman portrayed as a real human being, not a warped or bitter character, and a normal non-resentful wife.",/review/rw3008400/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2014,HillstreetBunz,10," Almost too truthful to bear
","This meditation on how a a Good man might fare as a Priest in modern inner city London is so real that, as in life, it's often almost impossible to know whether you want to laugh or cry. Often I did both. And at the same time. The story arc leads to flirting with the old postulation on what would we do to Jesus if he walked among us today, but the deeper insight is into what it means for us mere mortals, just to try to be good, even Christian, in this world, surrounded by the selfish and the self involved, the deluded and the indifferent. As writing it isn't being bettered anywhere on TV. As a company, all the players are brilliant, as the protagonist, Tom Hollander stakes a claim of such star quality, warmth and truth, as should make every writer and director beg to have him work with them. Along the way to the denouement, guest stars Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neesons involvement points to the richly deserved recognition that this show has received. The end is almost too much to take...but by a God I'm grateful that it got made.",/review/rw3008400/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2019,lb-37433,10," When my Friends ask about my Favorite TV Series.....I say Rev is #1
","This is a series I had to watch alone. My wife didn't enjoy it, found it to be odd and boring. Maybe it caught me at the right time. I was going through a faith transition, mini crisis, of my own and I was looking for alternatives to how I had been religiously programmed.",/review/rw3008400/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm not up on British religion -- I'm not up on any religion once it left behind the teaching of tolerance, peace and love and took up the search for power through politics -- so if I say something offensive to someone who follows the Church of England, just let me say up front that I apologize. That said, I must say I adore this vicar. He's often unsure, terribly vulnerable and flawed, but he means well by his congregation, his friends, his wife. He just has trouble sometimes keeping his human-ness in check. And that is why I loved this show. I also loved the last episode with its poignancy and doubt. The Rev. remained true to his character, as much as he always tried to be what he thought he was supposed to be, he was in the end just a human being.",/review/rw3008400/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2015,fiona_r_lamb,9," Brilliant!
","So this week I was flying back from LA to Toronto on Air Canada and noticed a British sitcom on their entertainment system. I managed to watch 4 out of the 6 episodes on offer and LOVED every single second. The writing, characters and observations on life in general were so well done.",/review/rw3008400/?ref_=tt_urv

25 June 2013,mailtheowens,9," Shows life of inner-city London priest.
","""Joking is undignified; that is why it is so good for your soul."" G.K. Chesterton. This show is good for the soul. Minister's on TV are always portrayed as hell-breathing sledge hammers, naive, bumbling, pleasant wimps or something more sinister. (In Australia no one even bothers to include them as characters as God seems to be an irrelevancy in ""the colonies"".) But this show is nuanced, perceptive, vaguely shocking and laugh-out-loud funny. I really like the way Adam prays in his head. I pray like that too. It feels a bit like Adrian Plass, affectionately irreverent. Maybe I am being a ""Nigel"", but if I was a minister, I would very much like to be like this one. An unsentimental show about a peculiarly profound vocation.",/review/rw3008400/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2022,lizs1289,10," A treat
","I missed this the first time around as it didn't appeal but I'm pleased I gave it a chance. Great acting from all, in my opinion. I have only seen to the end of series 2 as for some reason, Drama decided not to show the third one (yet). I particularly liked the scene at the end of the Christmas episode where the diners are seated as in The Last Supper by da Vinci. A priceless touch!",/review/rw3008400/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am catching up with the this show on the Drama TV channel, as I missed it when it was originally broadcast, it's supposedly BAFTA nominated though I really can't imagine what self respecting individual would wish to recommend this.",/review/rw3008400/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2022,Laight,7," Pleasant, easy to watch series
","It's not terribly exciting, and there are seldom any real plots, and very little actually happens, but it's a very nice story of an English vicar trying to do his best to please everyone around him. Tom Hollander is a great character actor but he struggles to be the lead in this -- the rest of the cast is so good it doesn't really matter. All in all, Rev. Is a nice place to land when you want a respite from the intense serious drama occupying most of the space on tv today.",/review/rw3008400/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2017,sparqui,4," First two seasons were enjoyable, third not so much.
","Not sure this really contains spoilers, but maybe for some people it will... This was a good show until season 3. Not sure what happened...new writers, perhaps? It was funny, fun and a lot of laughs. Then season 3 happened. It seemed to become mean spirited, not fun and had to take on all the 'social issues'.",/review/rw3008400/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2014,bashfulbadger,2," Why I didn't bother to revise my opinion of Rev.
","I finally gave this show a go, for the last episode in the series, and it's left me completely bewildered as to what all the fuss has been about. I had tried it once previously only to find the credit sequence so annoying that I switched it off.",/review/rw3008400/?ref_=tt_urv
