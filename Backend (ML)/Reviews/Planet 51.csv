8 December 2013,ma-cortes,7," Funny and appealing adventures starred by an astronaut and an extraterrestrial in a far planet
","In this successful Spanish picture there are humor , rip-roaring adventures , action , thrills and many other things . It deals with an American astronaut Captain Charles ""Chuck"" Baker (Voice by Dwayne Johnson) lands on Planet 51 thinking he's the first person to step foot on it. To his surprise, he finds that this planet is inhabited by little green people who are happily living in a white picket fence world, and whose only fear is that it will be overrun by alien invaders like Chuck. But on this alien planet the media has tagged spacemen as brain-eating, zombie-creating monsters, causing Baker to run . The planet is set in the 50s and even though much on the alien planet is round in design, nothing has wheels . There Chuck meets Lem (the name voiced by Justin Long, is also the abbreviation for Lunar Excursion Module. NASA's LEM was used as part of the Apollo program to land astronauts on the moon) , an average teenager working on getting the girl named Neera (Jessica Biel's voice) and furthering his career at the local planetarium . While , Chuck's command module called Odyssey (this is the same name of the command module used in the Apollo 13 mission) is orbiting the planet .",/review/rw2732889/?ref_=tt_urv

","American astronaut Captain Charles ""Chuck"" Baker lands on Planet 51 thinking he's the first person to step foot on it. To his surprise, he finds that this planet is inhabited by little green people who are happily living in a white picket fence world, and whose only fear is that it will be overrun by alien invaders...like Chuck! This film is made from the alien perspective. They are like the 50's Earth, they have the hippie guy, the youngsters who are open to new ideas that aliens are friendly. Frankly, I liked the film even though it wasn't epic or adventurous enough. This is a film made for the kids have a great time & I know they'll enjoy this. The thing I didn't like was that the love story between Neera & Lem seemed to be forced. Planet 51 is the hometown & Chuck the human astronaut is the alien in this film. It was funny at times & I think every youngster can relate to something in the film & the old timers can get a kick out of the 50's feeling.",/review/rw2732889/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2009,MartianOctocretr5,7," Didn't quite match expectations, but a fun watch
","It's an ""ET-in-reverse"" story. An Earthling astronaut gets stuck on what he calls an alien planet. The local green folks call him (accurately) the alien. The story is a fond tribute to drive-in's, space-creatures sci-fi, and the 50's. With the Area 51 reference in its title, you know the film will be poking fun at everything it can get its hands on, including itself. It delivers this.",/review/rw2732889/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2009,irelands-the,7," We all liked this film - This is a REAL review of the movie.
","First, I'll let you know about our demographic (to help you decide if you will relate to my review or not): I am a parent of a 10 year old boy, a 7 year old girl, and a 2 month old baby. I am in my early 30s, and my wife is in her late 20s. We are moderate movie-goers, as in, we watch a fair number of movies, and we miss a lot of movies. I am University educated, my kids are fairly typical of their age, and my wife is also fairly well educated.",/review/rw2732889/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2011,fred-m-stabs,8," Good movie - NOT a rip-off
","Please disregard RichardSRussell-1's review, I am not sure he watched the movie, at least not with very much attention. First, he states ""humans as the bad guys"" but the only human was the movie's good guy! The military general was the bad guy, and even a four year old could easily see that. Second, I'm not sure if he is familiar with movies playing on themes and paying homage to other movies, stories, and so forth. That's not ripping off, but that reviewer obviously can't even grasp that concept. Countless movies, perhaps most of them, will include scenes and lines deliberately intended to make reference other works – this is not plagiarism, it's paying homage! There has not been a single children's animated movie with this particular theme, not even close (at least no movie or major work). Yes, it is essentially a reverse E.T. and builds on many, many other movies that have come before. But the overall work is not a copy of anything else.",/review/rw2732889/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2012,TheLittleSongbird,6," Beautifully animated, if rather bland
","I have always loved animation, whether it's cartoons(Looney Tunes and Silly Symphonies), films or TV shows. Planet 51 is not a bad movie, but at the end of the day it felt rather bland. I've seen worse certainly, but I can also think of better out there. The animation is wonderful though, very rich in colour and detail. The soundtrack is memorable, there are a few funny moments that will have children chuckling, fun set pieces and a couple of Cold War pastiches that will keep adults interested, Rover is a great character and by far the best character of the movie and it all begins very promisingly. The voice cast are full of great actors, especially Gary Oldman and John Cleese, and Planet 51 generally uses them well, Dwayne Johnson is an especially likable lead. However, the story, despite its great premise, is rather weak and unoriginal in structure and after a promising twenty minutes it is never quite as interesting. I liked the Cold War pastiches, but some of the other references were verging on tired. Among the funny moments, there is the overall mediocrity of the script, with a lot of clichéd dialogue. The characters are weak and stereotypical, with one of the blandest villains I've seen in an animated film recently, and the ending is very predictable. In conclusion, looks great but at the end of the day it felt very bland and forgettable. 6/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2732889/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2010,ajs-10,6," MUCH better than expected!
","As you may or may not know, I'm a bit of a sucker for an animated feature and, having seen the trailer for Planet 51 a while back I was keen to see how it turned out. I must admit I was shocked how poorly it has been received. What I found was a funny, engaging film with a whole load of gags referring to just about every mainstream sci-fi/alien film. I admit it's not perfect, but I think it deserves another chance. But more of that later, first, here's a very brief summary (miss the next paragraph if you hate summaries).",/review/rw2732889/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2009,DICK STEEL,4," A Nutshell Review: Planet 51
","I have to admit the trailer was funny enough, with an astronaut so full of himself thinking that his planetary visit was an open and shut case, only to discover that it's inhabited and he's the alien in the truest sense of the word, like a fish out of water trying to make his way home lest he becomes an experimental subject.",/review/rw2732889/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2009,TheotherSak,6," Great quality, easy plot, fun... perfect for kids!
","First of all, let me say that I'm tired of dumb reviews saying ""why do aliens speak English?"" or ""they fart and burp a lot"". Disney's The Princess and the Frog's trailer has about 3 ass related jokes and one burp in less than 45 seconds. Toy Story's characters spoke English and understood humans and nobody wondered why. A house managed to be lifted by balloons in Up with no police radars detecting anything. So, this said: Let's sit down and enjoy a movie and stop looking for silly excuses to criticize it.",/review/rw2732889/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2016,anaconda-40658,6," Amusing Animation.
","Planet 51 (2009): Dir: Jorge Blanco, Javier Abad / Voices: Dwayne Johnson, Justin Long, Jessica Biel, Gary Oldman, Seann William Scott: Family animation about places and the beings living there. Astronaut Charles lands on a strange planet populated by green people. Among them is Lem who befriends him and struggles to hide him from authorities who seized his spacecraft. Directed by Jorge Blanco and Javier Abad who have fun with placing the shoe on the other foot in terms of who is on what turf. While the narrative is certainly bland at best it is equipped with a colorful animated world. Dwayne Johnson voices Chuck who gradually adapts in communicating. He is now the one being observed as oppose to the one observing. Justin Long voices the ambitious Lem who decides to assist him in reaching his ship. We know how this turns out and the supporting characters are an even bigger torn in the side. Jessica Biel voices the bland love interest Neera and that pretty much sums her up. Gary Oldman plays the stereotypical General Grawl who is out to expose and exterminate Chuck. Seann William Scott voices Lem's best friend who works at a comic book store. The role is as straight forward as it sounds. The screenplay will hardly appeal to adults but children may find its simplicity amusing. Interesting concept places humans as the observed and misunderstood. Score: 6 / 10",/review/rw2732889/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2010,kosmasp,7," Nice work
","Family Entertainment, nothing more, but nothing less either. The movie does have a few hints that only adults might catch, but it's overall kid-friendly. Which is not meant as a bad thing. It just doesn't have the complexity of a Pixar movie. But not every animated movie has to copy the Pixar style. It's kinda refreshing watching something like this as well as watching Pixar movies.",/review/rw2732889/?ref_=tt_urv

23 September 2011,itamarscomix,5," Better than I thought
","It wasn't half as bad as I expected. Planet 51 is directed mainly at children, and the humor is appropriately simplistic, which makes the infinite number of cultural references, of a type that was archaic when Pleasantville used them ten years ago, rather odd, because it seems unlikely that any child would get them, but there are enough laughs to make it enjoyable, even if the admittedly appealing premise runs out of gas after about fifteen minutes. If the movie tried to make a serious point about what makes someone 'alien' or about xenophobia and fear of the unknown, then it failed miserably. But as a piece of straight entertainment for the family, it's a fairly enjoyable (thoug forgettable) piece of film.",/review/rw2732889/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2009,Troy_Campbell,4," A very ordinary family flick.
","Director Jorge Blanco has crafted a weird beast. Planet 51 has the makings of a fantastic role-reversal tale – the aliens are more human than the human himself – and subsequently has plenty of opportunities for hilarity, yet it seems content on not doing much at all. Just when you think it is heading in one, funny, direction it turns down a boring, non-risk taking path that leaves you well and truly unsatisfied. Sure there is a nice message of 'never judge a book by its cover' that is always good to get across to children, but with no comedy or wit, who really wants to sit through 90 minutes of a message? What keeps this film from being a real stinker is the action. A few of the fast-paced sequences in the middle and final act are genuinely exciting and start to bring the movie to life; a chase scene where Baker and Lem are trying to evade the authorities is the highlight. However, even these scenes could have been a smidge longer and with added risk.",/review/rw2732889/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2009,loufalce,8," Fun!
","Forget all the bad reviews you may have read.This is a fine comedy-adventure that scores. Duane{The Rock} Johnson voices the American astronaut who lands on the title planet-a tongue-in-cheek reference to the legendary Area 51, only to find out that he is the alien on their planet that is inhabited by green people. The people speak English,drive hovercraft that resemble 1950s Detroit cars, live in suburban settings, go to drive-in restaurants , barbaque,and listen to a new kind of music called Rock'n Roll! In other words their entire society is based on nifty 50s American pop culture. This is a fun idea that could have been developed a little better, but it succeeds due to its obviously love of '50s culture and a keen sense of humor that adults will seem to get. The kids won't be too bored either. There are a few stereotypes like the gung ho ,lets get the aliens military men that are a staple of most all all sci-fi invasion films like Invaders From Mars ,The War of The Worlds The Day The Earth Stood Still, etc, but since they are fun characters you won't care. Should please lovers of 50's sci-fi and TV shows, comic books and those great grade b monster and drive-in style movies.A true fun film that the family will enjoy. There are a few toilet humor jokes, but they are funny rather than being offensive.Film also makes a subtle suggestion that even though people-including aliens and humans may be different, there is no reason why they shouldn't put aside their prejudices and get to know one another. Believe it or not, this is light years ahead of James Cameron's intergalactic turkey Avatar and the vastly over rated Wall-E.-though there is a robot that kinda looks like it. Adding to the fun are countless in-jokes and references to classic sci-fi films that movie buffs will recognize and enjoy. CGI movies seem to be a dime a dozen these days, but this one rises to the occasion ,stares down the competition and blows it away. Planet 51 is worth visiting.

20 October 2010,Buddy-51,7," a lack of pretension makes this one enjoyable
","The animated pic ""Planet 51"" – a Spanish/English/American co-production directed by Jorge Blanco - turns the sci-fi genre on its ear by having the earthlings be the alien invaders from outer space rather than the other way around. The planet that NASA astronaut Charles ""Chuck"" Baker (Dwayne Johnson) lands on looks and sounds suspiciously like a space age version of the 1950s, where English is the spoken language, rocks fall like rain from the sky, rock'n'roll classics blare out from every radio and jukebox, malt shops and bowling alleys serve as the primary venues for recreation and socializing, cheesy science fiction movies dominate the culture, and women in poodle skirts and bouffant hairdos ride around in cars that don't touch the ground. Lem (Justin Long) is a local teen who hides Baker when mass hysteria on the part of the community threatens this stranger from outer space with imprisonment, dissection or worse.",/review/rw2732889/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2009,Pumpkin_Man,7," Pretty Good!!!
","I really liked this movie. It had an awesome storyline. I loved that it was set during the 1950's on Planet 51, but is modern day on Earth, because I really enjoy 50's pop culture. Lem is an 'alien' who thinks that the Galaxy is only 500 miles long. On a typical day, an astronaut named Captain Charles ""Chuck"" Baker lands on the planet and thinks he's first, but he was dead wrong. All the residents believe Chuck is an alien who wants to eat their brains and turn them into zombies. Lem befriends Chuck and finds out that he's innocent. The military take over Chuck's ship so they can dissect it. If Chuck doesn't get back to his ship in time, he will never be able to return to Earth. I highly recommend PLANET 51!!!",/review/rw2732889/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2013,jboothmillard,5," Planet 51
","Alien invasion films have been around for years, seeing humans terrified by the Martian or elsewhere unknown beings and we don't know whether they are good or bad, and it was interesting to see a cartoon film taking the premise and reversing it, so humans are the invaders on an alien planet. Basically on Planet 51, a world populated by green aliens, in the town Glipforg set an era similar to the 1950's culture, average teenager Lem (Justin Long) has a job as the planetarium and has had a crush on Neera (Jessica Biel) for a long time, but he keeps getting interrupted by her hippie friend Glar (Alan Marriott) before he can speak his feelings, and he assumes Glar is her boyfriend. The world is about to change dramatically by the arrival of human astronaut Captain Charles 'Chuck' T. Baker (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) who has travelled a very long way from Earth to claim the planet he has found in the name of the United States, obviously spotted by the inhabitants he is the alien, not them. Thankfully Lem, eventually, is willing to let the human stay in his house and away from the media spotlight that will brand him a monster and a danger to the planet, all Chuck wants is to place his flag in the planet's soil, gather some evidence of his visit, and return to Earth as a hero with many screaming fans. Keeping out of sight from the rest of the alien race is not easy though, and when he is found out he is indeed made out to be a threat, especially General Grawl (Gary Oldman) who is happy to put him in the hands of mad Professor Kipple (John Cleese) and see him be exterminated. In the end, the human proves himself a good visitor to Planet 51 after saving the life of the General, he is allowed to go back to Earth and achieve his ambition, his faithful wheeled artificially intelligent probe Rover is allowed to stay on the planet as the best friend of Skiff (Seann William Scott), and Lem and Neera finally express their feelings for each other. Also starring Freddie Benedict as Eckle, Mathew Horne as Soldier Vesklin and James Corden as Soldier Vernkot. The voice casting is good as you can expect from a film like this, Johnson making a suitably daft astronaut and Long as the hopeless in love teen, the characters are all good fun, many of the laughs coming from the robot Rover, the story is simple to understand, and you can spit and giggle at the small spoofs of famous sci-fi films, like Alien, War of the Worlds, 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Terminator, it may be a little predictable, but the kids will love, and there is just about enough enjoyment for the grownups, a fun family animated fantasy comedy. Worth watching!",/review/rw2732889/?ref_=tt_urv
