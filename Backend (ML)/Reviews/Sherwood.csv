14 August 2021,owen-watts,8," Makes The Terror look like the Teletubbies
","The North Water - based on a book by academic and author Ian McGuire - is a dark and fairly uncompromising quest into the dark heart of humanity aboard a doomed whaling ship in the arctic wastes. A flawless cast (with a mesmerically beastly Colin Farrell), beautiful location shooting in Svalbard (and some of the furthest North for television) and the esoteric soundscapes of Tim Hecker make this a seriously riveting watch. The pace can sometimes slow to a crawl and the heady themes may get a little muddled along the way, but the whole is atmospheric and intoxicating. Seriously good TV - one of the highlights of the year for me.",/review/rw7198654/?ref_=tt_urv

17 August 2021,Tweetienator,7," Dark Tale
","A dark and twisted tale with some fine acting and good production taking place in the cruel world of whale/seal hunters in the mid of the 19th century. Lots of blood, sweat, grease, crime and violence. A show for a mature audience without any unnecessary gimmicks - recommended if you like such shows like Taboo or The Terror, or movies like In the Heart of the Sea, the classic Moby Dick, The Revenant (DiCaprio), The Vanishing (Gerard Butler) and so on.",/review/rw7198654/?ref_=tt_urv

","A subject that I don't think has had such a high production value put towards it, that being whaling. Even tho its only one of many themes appear in this story, I look forward to how they depict it.",/review/rw7198654/?ref_=tt_urv

3 September 2021,TheJonesBones,8," Two Words: Colin Farrell!!!
","This is a top-notch historical saga about a group of savage men hunting for whales in the Arctic, where they become stranded due to a deliberate act of treachery. While the entire effort seems virtually flawless, I write to commend one standout performance among a stellar cast: Colin Farrell!!",/review/rw7198654/?ref_=tt_urv

19 August 2021,rochfordsimon,9," First class drama. Colin Farrells best performance in decades.
","This is a brilliant show. Tells the entire story over one series. Slow building, but all connects well. The characters are interesting and acted without flaw. Jack O'Connell & Colin Farrell are the centre pieces of a historical story about the whaling industry and its toxic surroundings.",/review/rw7198654/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2021,dcarroll74,10," Yup
","It's going somewhere but, one must be patient. It's a multi episode so, bare with it. It's like reading a book, unless you turn to the last page, with little or no knowledge, you won't get the whole story. Such is modern life, I want it NOW..",/review/rw7198654/?ref_=tt_urv

","Didnt expect to find this gem!, if you're bored like me and stumbled on this review, take a chance. It has good acting, great landscape scenes and a believable story. I bet this one is going to end up with at least an 8.00 out of 10 score-wise.",/review/rw7198654/?ref_=tt_urv

24 October 2021,paul2001sw-1,6," Stuff happens
","Based on a novel by Ian McGuire, 'The North Water' is set mostly in the icy wastes of Greenland, following the crew of 19th century whaling ship. It features Colin Farrell, unusually playing a monster, and Tom Courtney, Stephen Graham and Peter Mullan are also in the cast. Unrusprisingly, it's well acted, the production values are generally high, and there are moments of truly gripping horror. But overall I found the narrative uncompelling. Jack o'Connell's character is the central one, but while he experiences a lot, what's absent is his sense of personal journey, that would turn ""stuff happens"" into a truly satisfying story. I wonder if something has been lost from the source.",/review/rw7198654/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2021,DLochner,8," The dark side of man, brutal
","The abyss of man is expressed in a ship trip to the end of the world. The series is dark and gripping, and absolutely marvelous in making - but sometimes very lengthy. In addition, the story is reminiscent of series such as The Terror or scenes from The Revenant. But that doesn't do anything bad. On the contrary, it becomes a real pleasure for everyone who wants to see actors in top form and the darker sides of people when they do. People on the edge.",/review/rw7198654/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2021,anthonymcdonald-52902,9," Gets Nastier and Better
","Many a tale has been told of men turning in amongst themselves, such a rich seam to mine a tale from. The cast in this are brilliant though
Stephen Graham maybe the best character actor around leaves the show too early. Farrell is a revelation, his choice of rolls and performances just bet better and better. In Bruges was some turning point. I haven't seen every episode yet but we now have the twin horror of Morphine addiction and every thing for Jack O'Connell the ships surgeon to face. This is turning into the best story of men against each other, the elements, the unknown, plain terror in a long time. Enjoy this, and replay certain parts cause there is more than 2 stories going on here.",/review/rw7198654/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2021,ollivernick,10," different and amazing

","I mean, good golly miss molly, this is exceptional tv storytelling from every angle. Plot, direction, the landscape, the cast. Man against nature, check. Man against each other, check. Menacing evil, check. Colin Farrell in the turn of his life, check.",/review/rw7198654/?ref_=tt_urv
