","So back when I was in high school The New Guy was released and my best friend and I saw it together, all I could say was that I wanted to pull a Dizzy, re-vamp my whole act for the school, we can all dream, right? But anyways onto the movie, The New Guy is actually a really funny high school comedy that is sure to deliver a few good laughs. I think the reason why is because of the cast, it looked like they just had a blast making this movie and made it completely entertaining. While it's definitely not the best acted or stands out against all other high school comedies, this formula worked and DJ Qualls truly made the movie into something special. He and Eddie Griffin were great for The New Guy, a new twist on the typical high school tale of freaks, geeks and beautiful people.",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2006,sigmoid23,9," It's not about the story. It's about the fun.
","A lot of people will say the plot of this movie was lame, predictable and dumb and yeah, they're right. But this kind of movie isn't about a brilliant plot. It's about interesting characters and silly gags and parodying those more serious types of movies. There are some funny lines, sight gags and slapstick, some cute girls, the bad guys get what's coming to them and the good guys win. Throw in some surprising celebrity cameos (some of which you might not catch until the credits roll) and a great soundtrack that mixes old and new songs and that's what I call entertainment.",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2002,kippardue_luvr21,7," Hilarious and a Great Cast!!
","'The New Guy' seems to stand out from all the other teen movies. When you go to see a teen movie, it is usually about the most popular kids in school and how they try to get laid. Though this movie shared some qualities of your normal teen movie, it had certain aspects to it that made it stand out from all the rest. I think it was the star studded appearances in the movie such as Tony Hawk, Gene Simmons of KISS, Vanilla Ice, Tommy Lee, Jurmane Dupree (spell??), David Hasselhoff, Horatio Sanz of SNL, and Jerry and Charlie O'Connell. What A cast! And of course DJ Qualls and Eddie Griffin were a hilarious on screen duo! 'The New Guy' certainly stands out from your average teen movie!!",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2002,little_bear777,8," well, it's another high school movie....loser wins!
","If you want a movie that's realistic, look somewhere else.  If you want a cute film, where the losers come out on top, this is a pretty good movie. Dj Qualls is becoming a really good actor, and he's got the role of the geek nailed.  Patten that boy for this part.  There are some choice moments in this movie that make it better then some, and Vanilla Ice is in it...how cool is that?  That's actually what makes this movie so great.  The cameos. there are some major rockers in this that will refresh the screen at times (towards the end).",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2002,deppland,10," A movie lovers movie
","If you are expecting another teenage gross out film, you'll be surprised to find out  that this is a cleverly disguised sweet movie about trying to fit in that cold cruel world called high school. This movie is filled with surprizes for movie buffs...and keep your eyes open for alot of surprize cameos.  And when the credits start to roll, stick around for the out takes.  You will smile all the way home.",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2002,Spanner-2,8," Entertaining bad movie
","This silly comedy features DJ Qualls (who was entertaining in a small role in last year's ""Road Trip"") as a high school loser who reinvents himself at another school as a popular tough guy. The storyline is pretty stupid and filled with more teen movie cliches than you can shake a stick at but the film is still kinda fun to watch because the filmmakers obviously knew they were making a crappy film and decided to have fun with it. Qualls seems to be having a ball with his role and Eliza Dusku (from ""Buffy"" and ""Bring It On"") never seems to take her ""Cheerleader babe"" stereotypical role seriously, always poking fun at cliches, especially in a pointless but hillarious swimsuit montage. Yea the film is utter crap but it was still fun to watch. GRADE: B-",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2015,SnoopyStyle,5," too silly, too broad, too convoluted
","Dizzy Harrison (DJ Qualls) and his friends Nora (Zooey Deschanel), Kirk (Jerod Mixon) and Glen (Parry Shen) are in a garage band and seniors in high school. They are also outcasts. Dizzy especially is picked on and he even has his penis broken. He gets arrested and befriends fellow inmate Luther (Eddie Griffin) who teaches him the ways of the prison. Back in school, he gets himself expelled and transfers to a new school. Using a new name Gil Harris and new attitude, he's cool and just got out of prison. He's the popular New Guy and attracts the attention of cheerleader Danielle (Eliza Dushku).",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2003,ScottDMenzel,7," A funny enjoyable Teen Comedy
",The New guy was a movie that I had mixed feelings about. One part of me thought the movie was going to be just another piece of teen garbage and the other half actually had hope for the film. I am very happy to say that the film was actually very good. This movie is not your average teen movie of coarse it does have a few sexual references but it doesn't go overboard with the sex jokes. The most important element of the film was its meaning which is believe in yourself and don't let the people around you control you. The plot wasn't too original but I enjoyed the film very much.,/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv

In an attempt to make a new identity for himself, he gets himself expelled, learns the technique's of cool from a prison inmate, and enrols at a new school under the alias Gil Harris, to make new friends.

19 January 2010,Jakemcclake,7," A Feel Good Movie With a Fairy Tale Ending
","Some Spoilers DJ Quails stars as a kid who purposely gets expelled from one school to go in to another school, where he can start with a new reputation. The story then shows him attaining all of what he wants, but he has to disconnect himself from his past. Then he is reconnected with the past he is running from. There are a couple laughs and a feel good or almost fairy tale ending, as all works out in the ends and he gets the girl and keeps his new reputation.",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2002,Tristan_mi,10," Dorky, funny, Cool
","Ok, this movie is so funny. It skips the cheap humor of farts, and sick jokes and creates a situation that is funny on its own. Its original, and fresh on the coming of age genre of movies. It somewhat leaves the coming of age movie, and goes more towards comedy. I like how they had a few elements of other movies, yet it remained original and funny. Crazy Eyes kept being funny, the outcomes and situations that happens at times on their own, are funny! Nice cameos, and a nice paced movie. i will be adding this movie to my collection and will love to watch it a few more times.. Its funny!",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2002,ashscott,10," A real feel good movie
","The New Guy, is just one in a long line of feel good movies, and this one has something for everyone, its funny, romantic, and has poetic justice, what more could you ask for?. Excellent acting from Eliza Dushku and DJ Qualls, is there anything his character cannot do to make himself look cool, Dushku is the girlfriend you want the school bully to have, she stands up to him, and puts him down at every opportunity. Overall its a super movie, if you want a laugh and to to watch something that'll make you smile, then watch this one.  And dont forget to keep watching at the end, the out takes are worth watching.",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2004,werbler,," as good as these movies can be
","just when you think they are going to go overboard with the dork vs jocks and dissing his old dork friends conflicts, they don't, thank you.  Plus, more often than not, the main villan does not even take that big of a role and his friends and girlfriend make him look like the idiot that he is. Because of these reasons,this movie is totally enjoyable and easy to watch.",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2002,gpolice_97,10," Eliza
","WEll, I give this movie a 5 out of ten for the film itself, I thought it was funny,and just plain fun. the other 5 is because Eliza is in it! therefore it gets a 10 for me!",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2002,elgen,," DJ Qualls sure know how to to act strangely and funny.
","I saw this movie about 2 weeks ago and i must say that i was impressed by DJ Q's acting as Gil Harris / Gale Harrison! Ross Patterson also was acting like a modern high school thugstah... Anyway, this movie made me laugh like i havent laughed since American Pie 1 & 2! :) This is a kinda classical teenage movie, worth to watch! Lets just hope that they make a New Guy 2 or something.. ;)",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2003,MLDinTN,," DJ and Eddie are funny in this
","DJ Qualls and Eddie Griffin, the prison buddy, are the 2 people who are funny in this movie.  This was pretty good since it did make me laugh some. DJ plays a loser(he gets his d**k broke by a 90 year old woman at school), who gets advice from Eddie, and gets himself kicked out of high school. He does some funny things, including intruding on the principle with a video camera to do this.  He then transfers to a new high school and builds a new reputation as the bad boy.  One of the funny things is the evil eye look he would give and Eddie does it also, and they play this background sound whenever they do it and everyone jumps back.",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2003,foffster,," Much more intelligent than meets the eye
","Rented this movie as a late sunday afternoon movie, thinking it would be lame and a no-brainer that could help me ease my hangover. I wasn't prepared to laugh, I just wanted something to watch without thinking too much. But it turned out to be the funniest movie I've seen for a long time! I reckon that those comments on this movie that were negative, didn't get the underlying humour in the movie that isn't that obvious. For me it was kind of a kick in the nuts to other teen movies, making fun of the clichés found in these films. At the same time it uses these elements to make some really good jokes and giving it a ironic touch. I mean; the ""whipping look"" was just hilarious!! Just the whole ""looser getting cool"" plot is so over the top, it has to be ironic. ",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2020,maddiebuggie,8," The new guy review
","There a lot of people who felt like this character does. This movie is very relatable. The character development, character, storyline, and plot are all duper good. There is not really about romance or more about self discovery and friendships. The main characters want to be a cool character that doesn't get picked on so he goes to another school. He ends up having to be a fake person but he learns by the end of the movie that if he be himself he will be happy and people will still like him a lot. I recommend this movie to anyone especially high schooler or people going into high school.",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2012,StevePulaski,3," In dire need of coming of age
","It's amazing what I'll allow myself to watch, isn't it? The New Guy lies comfortably at the bottom of the barrel in terms of comedic teenage-fare. Its jokes are tired, its sight gags consistently unimpressive, and its story only elevated by the capable performance of DJ Qualls. You may remember him; that geeky, weird looking kid from Road Trip? His only starring role is unfortunately a film infested with dead end clichés and stale jokes so powerful they could taint a resume for decades.",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2005,Howlin Wolf,2," It gets an extra star on account of Eliza Dushku. THAT'S IT.
","... The humour and the direction were just plainly abysmal. 10 or so minutes in, and with my preferred celebrity lust object still nowhere in sight, I was all ready to consign this straight to my list of excruciating sit-through's... and then, the miracle happened... The revelation that made me abandon all of my mental faculties and just start thinking with more 'primal' parts of my anatomy. Ladies and (especially) Gentlemen, I present to you Eliza Dushku, resplendent in several bikinis; and at one point making a deserved show of riding atop a mechanical bull... There was no way I could say that my time was TOTALLY wasted on the viewing experience, now! This film harbours some moments capable of making grown heterosexual men - and curious females even - weep. I should know, I'm one of those males; and the expression most capable of summing my simmering feelings up?? YOWZA!! Thank CREATION for beautiful women like her...",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2003,=G=,5," A dork by any other name...
","If the kookie schlock romp ""The New Guy"" was obviously a slampoon of the many unoriginal high school flicks with a similar plot it would have been more fun.  However, as the real deal, a film where the hero is a campus untouchable who gets cool and disses his uncool friends and then realizes he shoulda been content with who he was before and makes a bullhorn apology to the student body...you know the drill, this flick gets low marks. Bottom line is the story is hacked, the casting awful, the jokes recycled (except for the Braveheart and Patton bits), characters stereotypes,  etc., and the film relies too much of Qualls goofy looks. A no brainer for teens only. (C)",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2005,aimless-46,2," As Moronic as Beach Blanket Bingo"" Without the Charm
","When you buy a DVD of a teen comedy and enjoy the film you keep it for future viewings, if you don't like it you sell it. Used DVD's of ""THe New Guy"" have flooded the market and the price is down to just slightly more than one dollar. This supply and demand point should be a warning to any new viewers.

4 December 2005,MovieAddict2016,4," Amateur-ish and just not very funny
","For every good teen comedy there are about a hundred bad ones. ""The New Guy"" is one of the bad ones. That annoying guy from ""The Core"" plays Dizzy Harrison, nerdy high schooler who decides to leave and transfer to another school across town to re-establish himself as Gil Harris, a ""cool kid"" with bleached hair and leather jackets.",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2005,The_Void,3," A stupid load of trash...see it! No wait...don't see it!
","Some films are just simply bad. Either from poor production values, a dull story, a misplaced message or a whole load of other things. However, some films transcend that badness and become simply pointless, and The New Kid is one of those films. I'm not a massive fan of the teen comedy sub-genre, but unlike many cinema buffs; there are a handful that I like, this film not being one of them. It's amazing just how completely and utterly superfluous this film is and it's a wonder it ever got made. Of course, I'm sure money was a reason; but somehow I can't imagine that this picture was a huge hit at the box office. In fact, there are only two real reasons for watching this and neither of them are good ones. The first reason is to see just how stupid movies like this can be. Normally I would have turned this trash off after a few minutes, but I couldn't because I just had to see how much more stupid it could get. And I found out that the answer to that question is ""much more stupid"". The second not very good, good reason to see this film is that Eliza Dushku is in it. She may well be very, very sexy...but she really needs a new agent! ",/review/rw1054516/?ref_=tt_urv
