19 August 2020,Vartiainen,4," Interesting premise, bad characters
","Mortal Engines is based on a novel by Philip Reeve and adapted into a movie by Christian Rivers as the director and Peter Jackson as one of the producers. It's a story of a post-apocalyptic steampunk world where Europe has become a barren wasteland, ravaged and foraged by enormous mobile city machines. Strong eats weak, Darwinism is all but a religion and anything from the old world is hailed as a divine relic.",/review/rw4497897/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2018,bob-the-movie-man,5," At last, the hilarious Brexit comedy we've all been waiting for.
","As comedy goes it's classic gold! London has been transferred, presumably via a futuristic huge forklift truck of some kind, onto a huge chassis and is now chugging its way across mainland Europe. Needing fuel, it has the capability to gobble-up (take that Barnier!) other towns and cities (also roaming the countryside) which London 'digests' (smoke that Tusk!). Curiously, the captured cities' inhabitants are not exterminated but integrated into the City's population: so much for any anti-immigration policy! (LOL).",/review/rw4497897/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2019,CountJonnie,4," The only soul in this movie, comes from the soulless monster Shrike
","Thankfully, the reviews helped us getting into this movie with the right expectation. The movie is empty, hollow, predictable, rushed. The effects are slightly entertaining but fail to keep your interest for longer than 10-20 minutes.",/review/rw4497897/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2018,krishkhatiwada,6," Visually Stunning, lacking everywhere else.
","The movie starts with a great sequence introducing us to the post apocalyptic-steampunk world, and how it works. But from their on the movie is predictable and rushed, with story lines that you have seen elsewhere and executed better elsewhere. It's predictablility wouldn't hurt if the story and most of its characters were compelling enough to allow the audience to be invested and care. As the third act of the movie began I quickly tried to rummage through the entire movie trying to justify watching the movie and I was left with only a few reasons. One of them was the world created.",/review/rw4497897/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2019,danielfnemes,7," Better than expected
","When I heard the name and concept of the movie (it's about big cities on wheels) I thought wtf, what a stupid idea and wasted talent and money on CGI. However I found the movie to be pretty entertaining.
The good parts:

22 April 2021,TxMike,," Far dystopian future, cities are on the move!
","I enjoyed this movie mostly for the novel concept. Something really upsetting has happened to the Earth, there is some mention of a 60-minute war, perhaps nuclear. Now, at least 1000 years into the future, or as one character says, 1700 years after the big destruction, cities large and small are on very, very large traction devices, they travel the landscape and gobble up smaller cities for the food and supplies. The featured city is London with its many levels, the lowest for grunt work and the highest for the elite.",/review/rw4497897/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2021,neil-476,6," Disappointing. Looks good, but who cares?
","After apocalyptic war, the wastelands are inhabited by wheeled cities which roam around, eking a living. London is the biggest, and most predatory. Thaddeus Valentine is minded to create a vicious weapon in order to destroy a wall which prevents the cities from venturing into fresh territory. And young Hester Shaw is minded to kill Thaddeus Valentine.",/review/rw4497897/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2019,claudio_carvalho,7," Highly Entertaining Post-Apocalyptic Adventure
","In the future, after the Sixty Minute War, the survivors build mobile fortresses and big cities become predator cities attacking small villages or settlements to take their population, supplies, technology and resources.
When London takes a small mining village, a masked young woman called Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar) tries to kill their leader Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving) but the young trainee Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan) saves Valentine and chases Hester. She tells to Tom that Valentine killed her mother and escapes through a dumping hole. When Tom reports to Valentine what Hester said, he pushes Tom that falls in the hole off the city. Tom and Hester meets each other and they are forced to team-up to survive and she tells the story of her mother Pandora and Valentine, who killed her. They are rescued by a strange couple and soon they learn that their intention is to sell them as slaves. But they are saved by the warrior Anna Fang (Jihae) and they learn secrets about PandoraÂ´s discover. Soon they find that they need to stop Valentine to save the civilization in Asia led by Shan Guo and protected by the shield wall.",/review/rw4497897/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2018,Field78,4," Big names on the car, amateurs behind the wheels
","December is often the month to look out for one of Peter Jackson's fantasy spectacles since he and his writing partners Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh revived the genre 17 years ago with The Fellowship of the Ring. He has since treated us to two superior sequels, a pretty solid King Kong remake, and an underestimated Hobbit trilogy. A year ago we already saw teaser trailers for Mortal Engines, which did what teasers should do: they make us hungry. And of course, it had Jackson's name proudly displayed all over it. But don't let that fool you, because he didn't direct this one.",/review/rw4497897/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2019,Prismark10,5," Metropocalypse Mess

5 December 2018,Finfrosk86,6," Boy is this a mixed bag!

13 December 2018,Quebec_Dragon,9," Human instruments, fatal mechanisms
","I already know it's gonna get bashed for seemingly ripping off elements of Star Wars, but I think It's kind of an unfair criticism and I loved the film. Let's get that part over first: there are at least two main elements that might make you think Star Wars near the end. They're somewhat similar but not really the same and play out differently in a very different setting with different components.",/review/rw4497897/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2018,simon-81093,7," Good sci-fi action
",Better than I was expecting. Most sci-fi fans should like this. Lots of reviewers seem to look too deep and over-analyse. Just sit back and enjoy the ride!,/review/rw4497897/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2019,jasonwhite-19878,6," Not bad, but awful if you've read the book.
","I loved the idea, cities eating each other, but it hardly happens, the idea is introduced and then forgotten. The concept was great but I think Peter Jackson has lost the ability to adapt books. Lord of the Rings worked because the kept to the story and adapted it for screen, the Hobbit didn't work because they extended it into a bloated monster for screen and Mortal Engines fails because they have changed the story so much to make a their movie version. I didn't mind it when I first saw it, it's an ok film with great ideas that it doesn't really capitalise on but then I read the book.....",/review/rw4497897/?ref_=tt_urv

7 December 2018,raudafitriani,6," Have some potential but boring & predictable.
","I've seen a lot movies like this, so I think this movie is not for me - it's for the newcomers. Great visuals, CGI looks good also the cinematography but the story has some flaws and the characters are flat and annoying. Useless sub plots, I don't think it's necessary and lame.",/review/rw4497897/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2020,Leofwine_draca,5," Seen it all before, many times
","Another day, another Hollywood adaptation of a popular young adult novel. This time around it's MORTAL ENGINES, in which a heroine with a designer scar does battle with the boringly evil British ruler of a moving city that travels around decimating and assimilating its enemies. Yep, it's another story that takes heavy-handed swipes at colonialism while eager to put across its 'woke' credentials. However, it's also long-winded and completely mundane, offering CGI augmented action scenes and visuals that have already been done countless times. At this point in time, all of the HUNGER GAMES, DIVERGENT and other young adult offspring feel interchangeable, with no voice or insight of their own, and nothing to make them stand out from the crowd...",/review/rw4497897/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2018,MadamWarden,5," Great CGI
","I was pretty excited to see this flick for its amazing sets, artwork and CGI. It didn't disappoint. The plot, however, wasn't on the same level and the zombie/Terminator character is silly and unnecessary. Also the mysterious disappearance of the young engineer, potential love interest of the villain's daughter is never explained.",/review/rw4497897/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2018,thomasgabs,3," Pretty but stupid
","Absolutely gorgeous imagery but there is no coherence to the plot, the whole world the movie is set in is built very weakly from a storytelling perspective and the characters are annoying.
