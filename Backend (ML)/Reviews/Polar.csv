10 August 2009,Jamie_Seaton,10," a truly wonderful and powerful film
","if you've not watched this film yet then go see it, its a beautiful film. brilliantly crafted by one of my favourite and best directors around ""David Fincher""...... both the leads in this should of won Oscars, especially Brad Pitt. Just seeing him going through the aging process backward in the film is beyond brilliance. Cate Blanchett is very good too as the women Brad Pitts character loves in the film. All of the actors really give it their personnel best in this timeless classic. The film is fairly straight forward even though it is weird, Brad Pitts character was born old and through the years of his life he starts to grow younger and younger. It's just an epic journey through the life of what this man comes across. The film is on for about 3 hours but when I watched it that time went very quick. I do think longer films are so much better than short ones for the fact that they are more descriptive and you can get amazed by the story more. I'm so glad this won 3 Oscars even though it could have won more. It's not Fincher's best work but it's sure a film that won't be forgotten........ 10/10....... j.d seaton",/review/rw2005081/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2010,planktonrules,8," Sort of like ""Forrest Gump"" run in reverse and without the laughs.
","""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" sure got a lot of attention when it came out in 2008. It got so much attention that it received three Oscars and is ranked in the IMDb Top 250--currently at #247. And, as a result, when I finally got around to seeing it, my expectations were way, way too high. I was expecting too much, I am sure, as it's hard for a film to live up to all this hoopla. Now if I look at the film and try to ignore all these ridiculously high expectations, I see that it is indeed an exceptional film...but perhaps not quite the 'must-see' that I thought it was. I can't put my finger on it...it just didn't seem like a film a cinema freak must watch...though it was a nice, gentle viewing experience. And, after seeing this and ""Slumdog Millionaire"", I can see why ""Benjamin Button"" didn't capture the Best Picture Oscar.",/review/rw2005081/?ref_=tt_urv

21 December 2008,moviemanMA,10," It's a Wonderful Life
","Before seeing The Curious Case of Benjamin Button I wondered how I would react to the story of a man who is born old and gets younger as he grows up. Of all of the stories I have come across, this is by far the most bizarre and intriguing. If i had to pick someone to bring this story to the screen I do no think David Fincher would have been my first choice.",/review/rw2005081/?ref_=tt_urv

","Possibly the most anticipated winter film of 2008, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a curious film indeed. It's got an intriguing and completely absorbing story, as well as my favorite director, David Fincher, on the top of his game. With ""Button"", Fincher cements his place as one of the best directors alive, as his film is nothing short of magical, mesmerizing, riveting, ground breaking, and ultimately, timeless.",/review/rw2005081/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2009,alexkolokotronis,9," Do You Still Wish You Could Turn Back the Clock?
","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was a near epic film in almost the same way Forrest Gump was. I am not particularly a fan of David Fincher and his work. Yet I strongly admired The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. This film is about a man named Benjamin Button who leads much of an ordinary life under not so ordinary circumstances. The one thing that separates him from any other human being is that he ages backwards. Despite such large differences between the audience and Benjamin Button, the film finds a way to connect with a large variety of people in a way that does not seem to happen so often.",/review/rw2005081/?ref_=tt_urv

","In New Orleans, while in her deathbed, the elder Daisy (Cate Blanchett) asks her daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond) to read the journal of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) for her. Caroline reads the fascinating story of a man that was born a diseased old man on the day that the First World War ended; abandoned by his desperate father Thomas Button (Jason Flemyng) in an asylum for elders and raised as a son by the black caregiver Queenie (Taraji P. Henson). While aging backwards, Benjamin meets the girl Daisy and they become friends; then he works as a sailor in the towboat Chelsea and travels through the world, participating of the World War II after the attack to Pearl Harbor; finds love with Mrs. Elizabeth Abbott (Tilda Swinton) and returns to New Orleans, when he meets his biological father and Daisy, who is working as ballerina in New York until he finally dies as a baby. While reading the diary, Caroline discloses a secret about her family.",/review/rw2005081/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2008,acksurfer101,10," An Astonishing Rarity
","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any I've ever seen and probably ever will. A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance. ",/review/rw2005081/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2018,classicsoncall,8," ""You never know what's coming for you.""
","I think this film works as an example of how ordinary human beings can do extraordinary things when they have a desire to overcome their limitations and seek out a greater world outside themselves. The story is a uniquely creative and original one, told from the perspective of one principal character aging normally, and the other regressing after having been born 'an old man'. Their lives 'intersect' at the age of forty three, at which point Benjamin (Brad Pitt) begins coming to grips with the idea that he and Daisy (Cate Blanchett) are ultimately destined to live out their lives in separate ways. I do have a problem though with the timing of Benjamin's departure. The movie did a terrific job of restoring him back to a youthful looking young man over time, and it seemed to me that he could have enjoyed at least a decade with his daughter before heading off to parts unknown. His admonition that he didn't want to be her 'playmate' seemed hollow when Caroline was just a small child and he was still in his thirties. So that part of the story I think could have been handled a bit better. But otherwise, I thought this was a cleverly written story that also managed to reflect warmly on the racial component of having Benjamin raised by a black woman (Taraji P. Henson) who he considered his Mama. Interjecting the story with those humorous moments of the seven times lightning man was also quite brilliant, lending some welcome comic relief moments to a story that tended to get somber at times.",/review/rw2005081/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2012,mikes-movie-review-onlin,8," ""One of the best movies of 2008""
","F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' has been transformed into a splendid film by David Fincher. A marvelously made film, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is one of the best movies of 2008. The cast is terrific and director David Fincher beautifully puts together the tale of Benjamin's life. The only large flaw many will find is that the concept of the film's premise seems too unrealistic.",/review/rw2005081/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2009,h-rabbit,10," A great, worth film
","This film is worthy of a 10/10 rating simply because of its imaginative and complex nature, I mean, I couldn't bring myself to know why this simple idea of a man aging backwards hadn't sprouted up before. Set all the way back at the end of the Great War, to New Orlean's meeting with Hurricane Katrina, this movie tells the story of Benjamin Button, a baby born an old man of eighty, destined to die in the mere form of a zero-year-old. I found this movie very emotional and special because there's reeally nothing like it. I honestly thought, when I found out the immense length of the film, it was going to be boring....I was wrong, it gripped me from start to finish. There are many emotional and touching scenes in it, including the end, where it brings forth Benjamin Button's 'younger' years as an old man. Nothing went wrong with the cast, Brad Pitt played a great job as a reverse-aging man, and Cate went well as his childhood friend. Overall, this movie was great and I recommend it to anyone who loves the genre.",/review/rw2005081/?ref_=tt_urv

","a strange thing -to assume a not comfortable text for give to it new nuances. to chose the right actors. to send profound emotions who determine ignoring of make up and CGI. because the great virtue of film is the simplicity of story. nothing strange. nothing complicated. only a confession about essence of life. about a love story. about the struggle against time. it is a beautiful film for the manner to tell the story as to observe a river. serenity is the basic note. emotion is the obvious result. Brad Pitt remains, scene by scene, a revelation because he seems be part of his role , more than interpreter of it. he does more than a good job - he gives the perfect translation of solitude, joy, expectations and hope , perfect way for define Benjamin Button as reflection of the viewer. a film who impress. for its admirable simplicity.",/review/rw2005081/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, when I was working at a movie theater, I had seen the first hour of the movie, but never got to finish it. I was so disappointed because this movie looked like something truly special and finally I got to rent it, while I'm disappointed that I didn't finish it on the big screen this is one of the great movies out of 2008. Brad Pitt as we know has proved to be more then just a pretty face, he's pulled in some great performances, he needed a push though to get recognized by the academy and this was the role that he truly deserved to be noticed. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters that I'm sure will be remembered for all time, Benjamin Button, he plays the character with such love and passion, he and Cate Blanchett together once again to provide the perfect chemistry and make The Curious Case of Benjamin Button a very special movie.",/review/rw2005081/?ref_=tt_urv

""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is quite possibly my favourite film of the last 5 years (not since Sofia Coppola's ""Lost In Translation"" a contemporary film had moved me so much). I had high expectations for it, and they were way surpassed (fact: after ""Se7en"", ""Fight Club"" and this, nobody will deny David Fincher and Brad Pitt make great films together).",/review/rw2005081/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is unlike any other films I've ever seen and most probably ever will. It is an absolute masterpiece and will most definitely be one of the greatest films of all time. An instant classic. It is layered with top notch acting, well-executed directing and a magical soundtrack. It explores the subject of life, love and death, the death of the ones we love, on losing and finding and how it all connects. This movie is nothing but brilliance.

10 January 2009,axlgarland,7," Coldness and Warmth
","Technically, like most of Davin Fincher's movies, ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"" is a wonder. The curious saga of a man ageing backwards, gives Fincher the possibility of doing what he does best, tricks. It is the drama part that he doesn't seem to master or perhaps he doesn't care. ""Zodiac"" was his most coherent dramatic venture. Here he gets infatuated by the CGI and manages some spectacular punches but it is thanks to Brad Pitt the the exercise has a soul. He is truly remarkable. He manages to overcome the distraction of the gadgetry and show us the interior of the man. Brad Pitt's warmth wins over David Fincher's coldness and the most successful parts of the film are reflected in Brad Pitt's eyes. Geared towards an inexorable ending, there are moments of real beauty and tenderness. I'm convinced those moments could have been captured with a Super 8. The over direction of Fincher puts the emotional undertone in real jeopardy but, thankfully, the overall experience is mostly a welcome and rewarding one.",/review/rw2005081/?ref_=tt_urv
