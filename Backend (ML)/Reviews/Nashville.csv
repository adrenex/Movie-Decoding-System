27 April 2015,planktonrules,6," Very uneven but generally fun
","The premise of ""Drunk History"" is simple. You have someone sit down and talk about important historical moments in American history....but first you get them drunk and keep them drinking throughout the episode. As they (often) terribly narrate history, various actors (often very famous folks) act out the history and spew the profanity-laden dialog.",/review/rw4702894/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2017,Top_Dawg_Critic,10," The best (and probably only) educational comedy every made!
","OK this show is addictive! This has to be the best (and probably only) educational comedy every made! There isn't one episode I didn't learn something, or laugh out loud! Want to make America smarter? Add this show as required curriculum at every high school in America. For that matter, create more shows like this for every subject! Bravo to the creator and producers of this gem of a show! A perfect 10/10 (also my History test score!) from me",/review/rw4702894/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wow. I'm normally a bit hypersensitive to ""make-work"" programs for talented thespians, and ""Drunk History"" could sorta be described that way.",/review/rw4702894/?ref_=tt_urv

","Derek Waters brings his hilarious web series to comedy central, with bigger production values and entertainers replacing historians as the drunken storytellers. The two episodes I've seen of Drunk History are some of the most hilarious and entertaining television I've ever seen. The premise is actors/writers/comedians get drunk and tell a story from history, and the scenes described and narrated are acted out. So far, my favorite was where Adam Scott played John Wilkes Booth in the recreation of the Lincoln assassination. Some recognizable names play some of the historical figures; Jack Black was great as Elvis, Dave Grohl as Elivs's lackey, Jonathan Ames, Adam Scott, and Will Forte as Junius, John Wilkes and Edwin Booth, and Fred Willard as 'Deep Throat' in the recreation of the Watergate scandal. The funniest part, to me, is the dialogue the drunken historians give the historical figures that the actors then lip sync. I could use a bit less of the storyteller's vomiting...though, I'm aware that usually goes over well with comedy central's young male demographic. This series has great potential, and I hope it will find the success it deserves.",/review/rw4702894/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2020,13SecondFilmReviews,," Have to watch this high.
","Admittedly, this show is pretty dumb. But, I guarantee you that if you try firing up the ol' bong, that after five or six hits this show is ROTF funny! There, I said it. Sorry mom.",/review/rw4702894/?ref_=tt_urv

","Drunk History is very entertaining while also being real. It is factual obviously, but I love how the narrators put their on twist on the story. Hilarious show",/review/rw4702894/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2014,chipdfctoo,9," unfortunately on my own behalf
","as my summary states, unfortunately on my own behalf... i can attest to the multitude of drunken states of our narrators. i am and always have been (at least of the comprehensible age) been ""that drunk guy"". the thing that makes me love this show so damn much, the drunker i get... the smarter i feel, the more i know, the absolute truth comes from deep within.",/review/rw4702894/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2015,sellzmktng01,9," Very cool. Wish they had this show when I was in HS.
","A very unique approach to telling history, I must say. I like how they usually start off at a bar and get some introspection from intelligent people regarding what the ultimate discussions will be about. ",/review/rw4702894/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2022,Johnny_West,1," Sad and Pathetic
","Instead of making real history entertaining, some lowlifes decided to drag culture and education down another couple of notches and make this show. Not all the information is totally wrong, but a lot is. The only plus is watching tools slurring their words as they discuss history, and the really pathetic acting out of the stories.",/review/rw4702894/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2016,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,1," By the brain damaged. For the brain damaged.
",This was recently recommended to me. So I gave it a shot. Watched the episode that included The Alamo. And another one that included Lewis and Clark. I could see this being mildly amusing as a skit on Mad TV or SNL. By the end of the second episode it had worn me out. Watching people get drunk is not funny. Listening to them tell stories - badly - is not funny. The miming is marginally amusing. I find myself wanting to reach into the TV and strangle the narrators. I'm embarrassed for the actors. I'm humiliated recalling all the times I was drunk and telling crappy stories in the company of my non-drinking friends. Now I know what an asshole I sounded like.,/review/rw4702894/?ref_=tt_urv

10 December 2015,chimpsonson,10," Brilliant...
","Some of these reviewers are absolutely clueless. This show is hilarious. ""Uneven""??? They're drunk, you ding dong. The one who wrote ""I love history and I love comedy"" - dude, maybe Bob Hope is more up your alley if you're not getting Drunk History...Paget Brewster is...genius. Love this show - keep 'em coming, Derek. i do some college teaching and when the kids are a bit stressed I'll show them a scene or two from drunk history to lighten their mood a bit - this show is the best. I usually watch episodes multiple times because at first, I find myself more engaged by the story itself; after re-watching I can fully appreciate the pure comedy. Loved the First Ladies episode and Laura Dern's episode as well.",/review/rw4702894/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2017,drammed,9," Hilarious
","Let me assure you, as you read through these reviews, those that rated this series low have no sense of humor whatsoever. They think they know what they're talking about, they don't. This series is absolutely hilarious. Those that gave this bad reviews are certainly taking things far too seriously. The condescending, pretentious, asinine reviews some gave are utterly ridiculous; and an exercise in douchebaggery. Do not believe the d-bags and the pompous brit reviews. Judge for yourself. Sit back with a drink and enjoy this truly funny take on history.",/review/rw4702894/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2018,s0817546,8," This show consistently cracks me up
","If you are looking for a show that is uniquely funny, Drunk History is the show for you. The concept is so fresh and original that I find myself telling people to check out the show without telling them anything about it. I feel as though going into this show blindly (as I did) makes for a better first-watch and intrigues you to want to watch more. ",/review/rw4702894/?ref_=tt_urv

","To be fair to the series, I already knew I wouldn't like it when I decided to watch one, but I found the casting of Weird Al Yankovic as Adolf Hitler absolutely impossible to resist... I HAD to see that, even if I had to sift through 30 minutes of garbage to find it. And actually, Weird Al was excellent... wish his part had been bigger.",/review/rw4702894/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2017,MrPositive1,10," Currently my favorite television series
","Being a tad of a teetotaler myself and an extremely avid history fan (I have my bachelor's in history), the show feels made for me. The best part of the show is when the actors are mimicking the drunk storyteller's words. It's so random and comical. I've actually learned a great deal about history from this show while being ultra entertained with humor. Not many shows can boast that they actually teach people something without it coming off as ultra boring. In fact, this show may be the first of it's kind, a maiden voyage of connecting knowledge and humor in television. I guess my one critique would be that I've enjoyed it more with 2 stories per episode (or even 1) instead of 3, so the storyteller can delve deeper into the topic and characters. With 3 stories an episode, it feels a bit more flimsy information wise. For example the Hamilton by Lin Manuel Miranda. Which by the way, that Hamilton episode is seriously one of the greatest things ever created by man. The two girls Aubrey and Alia are simply off the chain and Lin's account has so much depth. We can just get so much more connected with the characters when it's a 1 or 2 story episode. Regardless, I love it, and keep em coming.",/review/rw4702894/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2019,mcgrew,1," History presented by those lamers who live in their parents basement
","I usually applaud anybody who tries to present historical information on, well, any media at all. But these guys are so lame, so boring, and so wildly inaccurate - specifically whenever presented with an opportunity to make up something ridiculous, and weave it in with the factual stuff, they do precisely that. You'd be better off with the History Channel -- that is, if they ever start presenting actual history again. Of course, ""Comedy Central"" (where this 'comical' show runs) doesn't present actual comedy any more, so maybe it evens up.",/review/rw4702894/?ref_=tt_urv
