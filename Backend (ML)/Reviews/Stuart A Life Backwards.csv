11 May 2018,jimmydragtron,10," One Of The Funniest Super Hero Shows I've Seen
","I've been seeing super hero shows since I was really young. But if there's a show that involves super heroes and is really comical, it's PJ Masks. While there's technology and powers, the heroes and even the villains would sometimes get silly. This is a decent yet funny show for all ages.",/review/rw5653095/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2020,ayleelove,10," It's a kids show guys.
",I'm only writing a review because of reading all of these adults bashing this show as if it's for them. It's a cute show. My toddler loves it. He was born over 2 months premature and has struggled with being behind his age in some areas. The main one is speech. This show and a few others have really helped him come out of his shell and talk more. Their nightly adventures are fun and the theme song is catchy. :),/review/rw5653095/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2020,cookey-85167,10," A Fantastic Farce For the Faux Fight Fanling
",I watch this with my 3 year old all the time and feel so blessed that we live in an age where an animated series so perfect for her exists such as this. There are clear moral and behavioral lessons in each episode that genuinely teaches your child a keen sense of moral values in a very colorful and entertaining way. Though there is the suggested idea of conflict there is actually no physical violence anywhere in this series. It's does a very good show of posturing and jumping around in order to seem exciting and energetic without actually teaching anything inappropriate or extreme. Very impressed with this series indeed!,/review/rw5653095/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2020,emlarae-48145,4," Repetitive
","My son loves it, learned who the characters were by the 2nd episode in and with him being delayed in speech, that's great for us. HOWEVER, every episode the plot is the same. Save the day, but there's always that ONE character that screws up the mission 3-6x's before realizing ""oh, that's right! I'm suppose to be a hero, better act like it instead of acting so dumb..."" it hurts my head to watch, but my son loves it so I guess I can spare a few brain cells listening to it.",/review/rw5653095/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2020,elenafdaniela,10," No need for explanations
","The real story is that some kids are fighting against the evil, represented by other kids ant the crimes are small and sometimes foolish ideas. This is great for children",/review/rw5653095/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2015,virgosdm,10," Layers of excellence
","My 3-year-old son absolutely loves this show. As a music educator, I see so many levels of excellence: music (writing, musicality), awareness of self and others, teamwork, apologizing, cool costumes, no violence, thinking through a challenge to find a solution, etc. I'm so happy there are shows like this that my son can watch on his own and I don't have to give commentary because I don't like something that's happening on the show. We quote the show often, and my son's favorite character is the Gecko. He even says his little sister is Owlette. Ha! I'm looking forward to all the merchandise to come out. We will certainly be ready to purchase! I'm also looking forward to new episodes since we watch over and over and over... :)",/review/rw5653095/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2015,desd-92147,10," we love Pj Masks
",I am happy to say I am a fan of the super-hero cartoon and when my sons age 4 and 2 years starting watching the PJ Masks I was moved. They love Cat-Boy and Gekko and tell me that I will be Owelette. PJ Masks is a really cute crime fighting trio that deals with everyday challenges of working together with others. This show encourages teamwork and teaches sportsmanship. Pj Masks also display that children get caught up in there own interests but when teamwork is required to fight crime they come together. My husband and I are really grateful for the creators of this show as it values children's innocence. We also look forward to seeing more episodes and wish the best for this TV series.,/review/rw5653095/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2020,BasedReviewGuy69,7," A Decent Show That Could Be Better
","Take it from a teen fan of this show. It's alright. The writing is good, the animation is good, the background music is surprisingly very good, the voice acting is decent, there's a fair amount of action which is entertaining to watch, and there is a good moral/lesson in almost every episode.",/review/rw5653095/?ref_=tt_urv

8 December 2020,Milk_Tray_Guy,8," Entertaining, innocent fun that lets young kids be part of the superhero craze!
","My own children are way past the target age for this show, but I caught it the other day and for some reason really fell for it. I'm a massive superhero/comic book fan anyway, and this lifts shamelessly from Batman in so many ways (including the scene transitions) but it still manages to be its own thing, with its own style. The main characters are engaging, and make good role models for young children. The show delivers a fair bit of action, but without actual violence (save that for when the kids are at least a few years older!). A great introduction to superhero/comic book culture (which, let's face it, isn't going anywhere!). 8/10",/review/rw5653095/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2017,arina-95931,1," Bunch of garrulous bloated orphans
","Not so long ago, superheros in kid cartoons were just working alongside with regular human law enforcement to help then with things they just couldn't: Superman, Captain America, The Mighty Thor, Batman,... and they DID NOT TALK MUCH. The technical aspects of kid programs, despite software advancements have deteriorated and thus, to compensate for the story they can't tell with pictures, the characters just need to talk a whole lot more instead. This is unfortunately a universal problem with all kids and junior programs these days. Almost no one has a family, bunch of kids just suddenly turning into super hero and talk their way into our brains.",/review/rw5653095/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2015,MagentaMSI,5," Gets old fast, sadly. Spoiler alert.
","When this first aired, my three year old loved it, as did my husband and I. Now that they've made 8 or 12 episodes or whatever the count is, I'm thoroughly bored. My son doesn't notice the repetition, and still loves it, so it's something we put on if we plan to leave the room or do anything else. Every episode goes the same: the three of them start a dialogue, one of them talks about how good they are at something they aren't that great at OR one of the others happen to be way better at. Then, something goes missing, they decide which of the three villains it was, they get into their superhero garb and then they try to save the day. Only problem? The third member of the team is being a showboat, and trying way too hard to prove themselves, and messes things up time and again, while the other two warm them they need to work together and they're not as good as they think. After a few mess ups, the offending member says, ""it's time to be a hero!"" They decide they need to work as a team to be effective, and save the day. They go back to daytime, everything is back to normal, and the team make some reference to their nighttime crime fighting in a secretive way, they all laugh. Show over. Every. Single. Time. There's nothing new, even in a new episode! It will quickly get on your nerves. I was not a fan of Jake, ever, but I prefer that, at least their shows vary.",/review/rw5653095/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2019,lcallen22,3," Almost Worse Heroes than Aquaman
","Somehow, these kids turn into superheroes at night to fight their classmates who turn into supervillains at night. How do they become these heroes/villains? I don't know. I dont think it's ever been explained. Basically, the same thing happens every episode so it's pretty boring. Still, if this serves as a precursor to getting my kid into real superhero stuff, I guess I can tolerate it. I have to ask, though, where are these kids' parents?!",/review/rw5653095/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2021,renitothend,6," the Disney equivalent of super why
","I think this show is solid, but very repetitive. Definitely better than Teen Titans GO!, but I wish it could be up to the standards of PBS Kids.",/review/rw5653095/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2021,eisler-zoltan,2," Shallow
","One of the shallowest and most merchandise centric kids shows that I've seen recently. The creators have clearly tried to hide morals in each episode (confidence in oneself, teamwork, etc.) but they take the backseat next to special effects and other tricks to get the kids hooked. Luckily we have managed to steer clear of this show eventually, thanks to better alternatives.",/review/rw5653095/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2020,mariaraluca-19590,6," Awfully repetitive

7 February 2019,ersbel,," So ugly!
","Watching cheap British animation, probably made somewhere in Asia, in the 1990s and early 2000s was somehow justified: any excuse to make low cost entertainment to keep the children enough in front of the screen as to watch the next batch of adverts. But 2015 and the same terrible animation plus an even lower quality script? No, thank you.",/review/rw5653095/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2021,ou-guangyi,," I Still Like It
",Although I am 24 I still like to watch this show it calms me down however I still think they did kind off added violence into it in the episode Moonbreaker because off what they did to Romeo at the end I know he's a villain but still its a kids show that can teach children that it is sometimes okay to hurt people and we're trying to teach kids if you do something mean to someone that's mean to you you will be no better than them that's only my opinion.,/review/rw5653095/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2019,annakathrynwork,1," Nearly Unwatchable
","Do your sanity a favor a DON'T let your kids watch this show. It's trash. Obnoxious, repetitive, boring, ugly animations. The moral is essentially the same every time, but the execution is so poor that it actually shows kids several problematic behaviors along the way. I cannot stress enough how annoying this show is! Worse than Paw Patrol and Super Wings.
Alternate recommendations: True and the Rainbow Kingdom (for littles), Octonauts, Dinotrux (some may find this too violent, so preview first)",/review/rw5653095/?ref_=tt_urv

12 May 2019,bubblescrosby,1," Repetitive.... extremely
","At first it was cute, but now it's annoying. The story is the same in EVERY EPISODE. I can't stand when it comes on but my 3 year old likes to watch it when it is. I know Disney normally had a 4 season cap on tv shows but they need to term in now and try something else.",/review/rw5653095/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2022,kassiily,1," Disappointing and inappropriate for children IMO
","Ya know, being this is on the lowest rating option available on Disney+ for children means it's suppose to be appropriate for young children, I'd say 4 and up, however, the way these characters talk to one and other is highly inappropriate. The ""villain"" is not only a villain but a HUGE bully. All he does is literally mock and bully the PJ mask. There is a LOT of name calling in it, which, frankly, I would not want my child to copy and let's face it, tv is very influential and children and adults learn a lot from tv, whether it be new slang words or attitudes.",/review/rw5653095/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2020,gustavsbeerzins,1," Excuse me WTF?
