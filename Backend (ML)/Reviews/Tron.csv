28 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Worth Watching!
","I've wanted to watch Bloodline for the longest time but kept putting it off for other shows for some reason. I finally gave it a chance and I loved it. I'm now mad at myself for putting it off for so long. It starts a little slow for some but stay with it because before you know it you can't stop watching it. Season 3 wasn't quite as good as the first two but it's still worth watching and really only speaks to just how good those first two seasons were. I do have to admit that the ending was just awful. The acting and writing are what makes this show so special. I can't say enough about the entire casts performances, they all do an incredible job and are led by Kyle Chandler, Ben Mendelsohn and Linda Cardelli. Those 3 all give award worthy performances. I know Mendelsohn and Chandler were both nominated every season for an Emmy and Mendelsohn even won an Emmy for best supporting actor. It's a show that's absolutely worth watching!",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv

",Season 1 is among the best television to ever be made. Season 2 lacks luster and season 3 is a joke.,/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Some great acting performances!
",Bloodline is every bit as good as everyone says it is. I can't say enough about how good the acting was. Ben Mendelsohn and Kyle Chandler give as good as performances as you'll see on a television show. The only negative thing about this show was how bad the ending was. There have been plenty of good shows with bad endings before but this has to be near the top for all-time worst. The show is still a must see but prepare to be disappointed by the finale. It's about a popular Florida family who dark secrets start to come out and make them do things they never thought possible. The story and acting is what makes this show so special. If you give this show a chance you'll most likely become hooked and want to binge it as quickly as possible.,/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2017,colinvernon303,3," WTF Season 3 !!!!!! Sucked So Bad
","I CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS I've SEEN IN YEARS !!Season 1 and 2 are excellent ...Season 3 is an absolute mess , not one bit interesting exciting ,it seems it was made by a totally different production company its just horrible ..every episode is slow meaningless drawn out , its simply lazy writing to wrap up a once good story ! Kyle chandler is the only good thing in the show he is a great actor . but man season 3 is miss able even if a fan of 1 and 2 .",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2017,Rollum,3," A total let down
","The first season of Bloodline was entertaining and suspenseful. The Rayburn family have a secret, they seem like royalty with a skeleton in the closet. Danny (Ben Mendelsohn) comes home and you immediately sense there is some serious trouble coming.",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2017,cherold,8," Fascinating first season, then ...
","It took me a long time to start watching Bloodline. I felt I should, because it got such solid reviews, but the description - black sheep brother returns home, did nothing for me.",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2015,jeffpsy,9," Binge-worthy
","Bloodline is a quality Netflix series, that totally validates their strategy of delivering a season in complete, binge-worthy form, rather than an episode at a time. I watched it over two days. It's hard to imagine a movie with a better cast; the performances from top to bottom were sensational. I also appreciated the salty, adult, realistic language of the characters. One of the earlier reviewers spoke of all the characters as being ""terrible people."" Couldn't disagree more; virtually all the the characters from Kyle Chandler to Sissy Spacek to Cloe Sevigny are likable, compelling individuals who find themselves in a difficult situations. It's about good people making fateful decisions. Bloodline is a beautifully produced, deeply human drama, that, once it gathers speed, will grab ahold of you. Kudos, Netflix.",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2015,JasonDanielBaker,," Only The Greatest Night-Time Soap Opera Ever Made!
",Welcome to Rayburn House - a quaint family inn situated in an idyllic part of the Florida Keys. It is the perfect place to forget troubles if you're there on vacation. But it is a near constant reminder of tragedies that have plagued the family who own and operate the resort.,/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2017,tightspotkilo,8," Secrets, Lies, and Story-Telling Interruptus
","This seemed in its first two seasons to be a most promising show. Leading with Sam Shepard and Sissy Spacek as Robert and Sally Rayburn, it has a great cast, Ben Mendelsohn, Kyle Chandler, and Norbert Leo Butz particularly stand out, but there are no weak acting performances. The setting is the Florida Keys, and the story line taps into Southern Gothic elements and into the prime time soaps of the 80s such as Dallas and Flamingo Road to draw inspiration. Lots of long-buried but not forgotten family secrets and lies swirl around, creating intrigue, mystery, things that happened long ago, but still loom large.",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2017,Britinmiami,5," Too bad it peetered out!
","We loved this series until it got to the last two episodes! Yes, a couple of scenes with flashbacks is OK but a whole episode! It got tediously boring and it was so obvious that Mendelson was wearing a really nasty wig. Did they run out of money? A great series with a really poor ending! Pity!",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2018,cdb-22,7," Dreadful season 3
","I really enjoyed season 1 , this series really promised a great deal, season 2 was a disappointment in comparison with the plot becoming more and more far fetched and with some new characters who just didn't fit , you know when the script writers start running out of ideas when ""ghosts ' or figments of imagination start appearing and by season 3 they were running riot and haunting the whole show with dream after dream and whatever! and after a while I just didn't care at all what was dream or reality it just all became totally pointless.",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2022,nicolesammut,9," Awesome Viewing
","Perhaps one of the best mini series that I have seen in a while. Continue to recommend this one to many friends and family.... Is it because one of the leads is a fellow Australian. Or because I come from a big family;.... Either way, great viewing and tv entertainment. Great story line and the location is pretty good too.",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv

Season 3 Episodes 9 & 10 = 3 (unfinished).",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2022,kerimalpalt,9," This Should Have Been One Season Only
","The first season of this show is so powerful, groundbreaking well made and complete it requires no second or third seasons. It is a stand alon, in fact when i had finished the first season back when it had first released i thought i said goodbye to the series it was over the story was told only to see a second season years later. I wasn't even looking for it because i think it doesnt need one. I think the first season defines this series and the rest is a stretch and i hardly remember anything that happened after the first. Watch the first and leave it. MY SCORE IS FOR THE FIRST SEASON, and for me the first season is a stand alone limited series.",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2017,wtmerrett,4," Watch The 1st Season.....Only!
","I really liked the 1st season of Bloodline as it was well, lay-ed out and acted. The characters were well developed and you cared about them. The writers and producers had the 1st season all figured out before they shot a foot of film and knew where the story was going to go right up to the end of the last episode. Then the thing came off the rails! The 2nd season was not even close to being well thought out and the writers scrambled to find their way as the story meandered and did not follow the same sort of road map the 1st season had. The 3rd season was a complete disaster and was done purely for the money as they had no idea where the story was going or how to get from A to B. It was almost painful to watch, but watch we did to see if by some chance they would pull it altogether at the end. Nope. not a chance, it was a waste of our time. I get so annoyed when producers allow their integrity to be sold down the river for the fast buck from the network for an additional season of a show that is clearly past it's sell by date. I gave this a 4 rating for the 1st season only as it was very well done so the rating for that alone should be higher. But the 2nd & 3rd season sucked so bad the rating had to drop. If you are interested in Bloodline and have not watched any of it, do yourself a favor and watch the 1st season only and then stop. I'm very serious here, really stop.",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2015,jill_grant-rowe,10," A Masterpiece
","Having now watched the complete series in an utterly unstoppable binge I can say without a shadow of a doubt that, for me, this is up there with the greats like True Detective, Breaking Bad and Rectify (to name but a few). Never so much has a show swayed my feelings towards the characters; I had several about faces with regards to my sympathies but it left me feeling that nothing is ever black or white. This is not for those who want a fast pace and constant excitement. The characters are developed slowly and cleverly as is the storyline which keeps you guessing. The cinematography is phenomenal and I bet you will all be wanting to move to The Keys after watching this I do hope they make a follow up series, however if they want to leave us wanting more but very satisfied at the same time stopping here would do just that. The cast, without exception were stellar in their performances.",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2017,mplag27939,7," Season 3 complete waste of time
","I loved the first 2 seasons of Bloodline. Great story and acting. But WOW!!! season 3 was terrible. I assume the writers did not know what to do to conclude this show. My wife and were so eager for this release but man what a let down. This is my first time to submit a review to IMDb as I tend to just read other reviews. However, I felt compelled to express this opinion. If you have not watched Bloodline yet, my advice is to watch and enjoy seasons 1 & 2 but stay away from this 3rd season.",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2017,weybug,5," Started great then turned to poop

16 June 2021,peterDM-30380,4," Careless Writing
","There's a fine line between creating characters the viewer loves to hate and unintentionally crossing that line and creating characters the viewers just plain hate. In this instance, the writers did the latter. It seems they believed they could use the same magic they created with the antihero of Danny in season one by applying a similar treatment to the choices of the other characters in subsequent seasons. It just didn't work. By the end of season two, you want to slap every one of the characters, and if you're like me, you actually cheered when one of those characters actually got slapped. By the end of the third season, you move from wanting everyone to get slapped to hoping they all get thrown in prison for their gross behavior. What killed the series was that there was not one likable character by the third season, and that's not enjoyable to watch.",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv

12 April 2015,paulcreeden,2," Like watching paint dry.
","I am amazed by the high rating of this series here. I am a Netflix fan, but I found this series unwatchable. It seemed trite, derivative and badly written. The one plot line, the misunderstood addict son, is explored beyond interest. I guess, if you do not understand addiction (yours or anyone else's), you might find the twisted behaviors of this affluent family fascinating. However, since I am all too experienced with these phenomena, I found them all rather predictable and boring. And that, in my opinion, is a good thing. I do credit this work with its good production values, but I'd rather stare at a true masterpiece. Plugging in two scions of drama, like Sam Shepard and Sissy Spacek, does not keep this leaking ship from sinking into the rising Florida seas.",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2017,gustheaffen,2," A family that can't let go of the past which should be long forgotten*spoiler*
","The entire premise of this show is based on a tragedy that happened over 30 years ago. The oldest child was beaten by his father after his sister drown under his care. Seriously, this is the big earth shattering secret and Danny 30 years later still holds his siblings responsible for lying to a police officer about how his injuries happened. A detective, for no good reason, gives Danny some audiotapes of the other kids lying under police questioning and he listens to those throughout the first 13 episodes as he seethes with anger and decides to mess with his siblings, having one beaten severely, threatening to spill secrets to ruin another's impending marriage and just generally being a complete scary, menacing and conniving jerk that puts his entire family at risk by running drugs through their hotel. They blow the end result the first episode in flashes of what is to come (a dead Danny being dragged through foliage), the viewer just has to watch and wait to fill in the details of how. The second season is a lot of trying to cover the crime ending up with yet another crime (hardly original). You can usually see the twists and turns coming a mile away. I enjoyed watching John Leguizamo and Jamie McShane. The rest of the acting was so-so. I honestly couldn't stand watching the always tearful and whiny Sissy Spacek or the incredibly annoying guy that played Kevin. Season 3 was a complete disaster. The last 2 episodes took the series from a 5 to a 2. I hated the dream type sequences of you don't know what is real. They should have ended it in 8 episodes and spared us that mess. Somehow I doubt the Rayburns were ever going to be a happy family and even if the 'tragedy' didn't occur, Danny was going to be the same diabolical loser. He was just a guy that never took responsibility for himself. And the other kids were given far less monetary support but for Danny it was never enough. Trying to make a sob story about a grown man having his father make him decide between getting financial support for his son or his restaurant, only being able to choose one wasn't generating sympathy. In the end it turns out the Inn isn't worth anything anyway, global warming or some such BS is going to mean it is under water so they should have just let Danny get caught with the drugs, he'd be in jail and they'd all be free of their demons. Too bad it wasn't a much better story, too well cast for this garbage.",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2017,randomStuff101,4," Final Season Review - Disappointing
","Disappointing final season. It's obvious they never had a solid story figured out beyond season 2. Can't blame them, there's only so many places the story could have gone without flogging a dead horse, such as ""what did Kevin do now"".",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2020,sue-06239,8," Loved S1 & 2
","Good family drama, brilliantly acted by Kyle Chandler and Ben Mendelson (who is so charismatic that he steals every scene he's in). Series 1 and 2 are enjoyable and binge-worthy although I found the character of Kevin really annoying because of his stupid decisions and gullibility. Series 3 though, gets worse as it goes along and the penultimate episode was really silly.",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2019,camsod-95152,8," Such a good start, such a bad ending
","How can you rate 3 seasons when they are so different? I loved the first 2, but the third was really bad. Don't know what happened in production but something must have happened. The third season didn't have any of the qualities and ideas in the first two. Too bad... I'm leaving this on a very bad impression.",/review/rw4902223/?ref_=tt_urv
