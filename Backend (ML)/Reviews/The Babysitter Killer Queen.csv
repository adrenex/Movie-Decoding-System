23 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,9," Good Sci-fi Series!
","Stranger Things absolutely lives up to all the hype! This worldwide phenomenon has been one of the most talked about shows since it came out back in 2016 and for good reason...it's terrific! It's an absolute blast to watch and will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. This has everything a show needs to be great...action, comedy, drama, suspense, even nostalgia with this show. You really come to care for these characters and what happens to them. Obviously, season 1 was the best but the others are not far off. All are absolutely worth watching and I can't wait for the new season! Season 5 of s going to be its last so hopefully it goes out as good as it started. I can't wait!",/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2016,planktonrules,10," Strange, that's for sure...but also very, very good.
","""Stranger Things"" is a very big surprise. After all, it's a made for Netflix series, so it's going to be cheap and suck...right?! Well, no...fortunately. Despite having mostly no-name actors and a modest budget, this show turned out to be a hit and one that promises to bring us more episodes. At the time I am writing this, the eighth episode has been aired and the series appears over...or so you think until the very end.",/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,8," Never judge a book by its cover.
","I am one of those people that was put of by the thought that this was a kid's drama, from the advertising you'd swear this was aimed at a 4 o'clock after school transmission time, the reality is far from that. It's quite intense drama, thoroughly absorbing, the kind of show you can't help but binge watch. As someone that grew up in the Eighties, I can appreciate the detail that's gone into the production, it's like they slipped back and filmed it live, it is incredibly well made. I utterly love the music, it is so fitting, takes me back to wonderful eighties shows. Quality in both season one and two, I like the build up and tension that is abundant in the first. It's like the Goonies meets The Quatermass Experiment.",/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2016,cherold,9," Captures that '80s magic
","There is no reason, in terms of story, for Stranger Things to take place in the '80s. But the '80s atmosphere - the dial phones, the chain smoking, Winona Ryder - are there to clue you in on the inspiration for this movie, which is pretty much every supernatural movie from the 80s with a focus on kids. E.T., Poltergeist, that sort of thing.",/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,9," Lives up to all the hype!
","Stranger Things is absolutely as good as everyone says it is. When a show is as talked about about as much as this one has been it's hard to live up to expectations. Stranger Things has not only met those expectations but has surpassed them in every way. This is the show that our Netflix on the map as far as original shows go as this was not only one of their first but their biggest. As much as I love this show it's probably time for it for end and it is. This upcoming season is going to be the last. We have literally watched this cast grow up, they were children when this show first started and now they're all in their 20's. I can't wait for this last season and going to miss it when it's gone.",/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2023,dszabo-53136,10," Very good
","The series is set in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana in the 1980s and follows a group of friends as they uncover supernatural occurrences and government conspiracies.",/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2018,gogoschka-1,," A nostalgic callback to the stories from my youth - but also a beautifully shot supernatural tale with charming performances and great production values
","There were two dominating forces in the eighties that had a lasting effect on my cinematic taste for ever after and also resulted in my undying love for fantasy, sci-fi and horror stories: Steven Spielberg and Stephen King. I guess it isn't an overstatement to say ""The Two Steves"" probably influenced and shaped the imagination - the dreams AND the nightmares - of an entire generation.",/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2022,magnoliacream,10," Never fails to satisfy
","Season after season, this always leaves me feeling amazed, exhilarated and fully satisfied. There is an element of familiarity, even cliche, about the stories involving aliens, monsters, lab experiments, orphans and family relationships, yet the way they are presented is both nostalgic and magical.",/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,jasperMeulendijks7,10," This is something you must watch! (season 4 review)
","Review season 4
I still have a lot to say. There are almost no downsides to this series. Let me start with the fact that the characters are all fantastic and Eddie in particular is a really great addition to the cast. I think his character arc is phenomenal. I can say something positive about everyone. I'm watching this season for the 4th time now and it's still very good. In fact, now that I watch it for the 2nd time, I notice more and more details. What I also really like about the series is that everyone can compare themselves to a character. Furthermore, this is a bit of the season with the denouement of all your questions. The special effects look very good. What I actually like the most in terms of story is that this season really brings you back to the first season. This season also brings back several characters from seasons 1 and 2. I still have to say it, but argyle and murry are the funniest characters in the series. Almost everything they say is so funny! I laughed incredibly hard several times. I think that's really cool anyway if you don't just have to laugh in a series, but also cry and watch enthusiastically. I think that all emotions pass by at some point and that is really something that is great! Yes, I really shed some tears at the end of season 4. I really can't wait for the 5th season. Unfortunately that will take a while... I must also say that this feels a bit like a comfort series. This is truly something I could watch for hours. It never gets annoying. If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for? Now fire up Netflix and go watch it.",/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2023,hjvergara,9," Season 4 Review - Best Season Yet!
","After watching the final two episodes of ""Stranger Things: Season 4"", I appreciate the decision to make them into longer episodes - I understood the importance of wrapping up two essential story arcs: that of Papa and El and then Vecna and...everyone else. Well...so to speak. When all is said and done, I can't help but think of Plato's Allegory of the Cave.",/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2022,cc0077,10," I get the hype now
","I just finished the last episode of season 4 and that was QUITE THE EXPERIENCE, I was shocked by how long the episode was but every second of it was entertaining. Season 3 was personally my favorite because I think that season had the most comedic scenes, and it just felt very vibrant in general. I LOVED HOPPER AND JOYCE and I'm so excited to see them in future seasons as well. So excited for season 5!!",/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2023,chiragrathod19,10," One of the best Netflix show.
",Stranger Things as a whole is one of the best shows I have seen so far. First three seasons have been exciting and stunning but season 4 is extraordinary üëåüèª. The Duffer Brothers knock it out of the park for what I believe that this series is one of the best netflix series so far. There are so many twists and turns and it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. This is one of the most addicting series that I have ever watched. I love the characters so much! The storylines and characters are so fleshed out and watching it gets me emotional and millies acting is superb. Can't wait for season 5.,/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv

","This series is set in '80s Hawkins, Indiana. As it opens twelve year old friends Will Byers, Mike Wheeler, Dustin Henderson and Lucas Sinclair are playing Dungeons and Dragons. Shortly afterwards Will vanishes; he has been taken to 'The Upside Down'; a dark parallel universe. Around the same time a mysterious girl, known as Eleven (shortened to El), turns up.

16 December 2017,lee_eisenberg,10," what we know and don't know can lead to perceptive contrasts
","Since its debut last year, Netflix's ""Stranger Things"" has become a popular show. I just binge-watched the first season. A couple of things struck me. One is of course the focus on government secrets and how Will's disappearance leads to the realization that this small, idealistic town might not be what it seems. Equally significant is the look at and allusions to 1980s popular culture.* But beyond that, there's the contrast between Will's family and Mike's family. Mike comes from an affluent family in an immaculate house, while Will comes from a working-class family in a house not in the best condition. These set the stage for the eerie events soon to dominate the town.",/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2017,Kevin-42,," Two very different seasons (EDIT: A few words about Season 3)
",I guess plenty of people have said a lot of things about all the movie and TV references this series has and how it recreates the eighties in all their faults and splendor. I will not add to that.,/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2017,ahmetkozan,9," Again a very nice series from Netflix!
","Stranger Things is a 1980s inspired and themed science fiction horror Netflix show. The show is set in November 1983 and takes place in the fictional town of Hawkins. Hawkins residence live a fairly normal life until a boy named Will Byers goes missing in the woods. Three of Wills friends Mike Wheeler (played by Finn Wolfhard), Lucas Sinclair (played by Caleb McLaughin) and Dustin Henderson (played by Gaten Matarazzo) are very worried for him but what they uncover something more dark and sinister. After looking for their missing friend they come across a girl, who they call Eleven because of her tattoo. However they soon find out this isn't any ordinary girl but one with very special powers. It is very clear the show takes lot of inspiration from classics 80's films like The Goonies and ET. ",/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2022,BrnzReviews,10," What A Watch Must See!
","Stranger Things was an amazing surprise upon watching it I had no idea what kind of adventure was ahead of me. The best way to put this show is a love letter to the '80s classics that captivated a generation. 'Stranger Things' is set in 1983 Indiana, where a young boy vanishes into thin air. As friends, family and local police search for answers, they are drawn into an extraordinary mystery involving top-secret government experiments, terrifying supernatural forces and one very strange little girl.",/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2016,deloudelouvain,9," Back to the eighties!
","Netflix did it again with Stranger Things. It's a very pleasant and easy to follow series to watch. It's like a time warp back to the eighties. A mixture of The Goonies meets The X-Files meets Close Encounters Of A Third Kind. I watched the whole first season in just a couple days. You immediately get hooked on this show. I don't know if the makers will add another season to it and if they do I'm already very curious what it will be about. Will it be a complete other story or will it just continue where the first season ended? It doesn't matter to me, I just want more seasons like this one. The cast is very good. All the actors fit perfectly well in the story. There is enough suspense to keep you interesting all the time. Watch this one, you won't regret it.",/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,martin_merelesc,10," A very interesting series of mysteries
","Dark, creepy, and wonderfully intriguing, this series set in the 1980s will remind you of many a sci-fi or horror movie from this era, in the nicest way you can imagine. There is little violence and gore, but the atmosphere is very tense and scary, and because there are relatable child and parent characters, the whole family will have someone to root for. Stranger Things is a bit spooky for younger kids, but tweens and teens will be interested in the mystery and finely drawn characters, and adults will be amused by the vintage clothing, technology, and prices, as well. The bravery of young heroes, who are always ready, willing and able to avert catastrophe when the adults in their lives fail.",/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2018,TheLittleSongbird,8," Turning the world upside down
","Having heard nearly nothing but good, actually great, things about 'Stranger Things', despite it attracting some criticism (like a lot of popular shows do these days, interest was high watching it. Due to being so intrigued by its concept and various ideas and tones.",/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2021,SoverniX,9," The series is beyond the ideas of the other world!
","The 8 episodes of the First season flew by unnoticed in the extraordinary film atmosphere. The creators managed to shoot a unique work, in which the motives of famous books and films of previous years are guessed. The sci-fi character sets the main tone for the entire tape, but high-quality directing does not give even a second to get bored. An exciting plot, a cool game of actors, diversity and retrospectives, coupled with fascinating music, immerse the viewer in a world that you do not want to part with. This is a film that is interesting to reflect on, discuss with friends and even draw parallels with your own realities. Each episode is a new batch of intrigues and impressions, secrets and solutions, almost always unpredictable. The ending of the first season leaves a lot of questions...
To the delight of everyone who has managed to fall in love with Stranger Things, the release of season 4 is expected soon, which has been postponed many times due to the pandemic! In the meantime, there is time to reflect on what he saw, and maybe watch the series again in the company of interesting people. I think this film will also appeal to modern teenagers, for whom the entourage of the 80s with its games, customs and traditions will appear in a new light. Everyone in this film will be able to find a favorite hero, according to their ideals and preferences. In particular, I would like to note the highly professional game of Finn Wolfard, who played Michael. His character is an example of a kind, truly bright boy who knows the value of friendship. To be honest, throughout the season I often caught myself thinking an annoying thought - why wasn't I like this as a child? There was also a place for tears, which it was sometimes impossible to restrain (although I am not so sentimental). The film is really addictive, as if you are experiencing events, joy and pain together with the characters. A movie for a wide audience with meaning and a great plot!",/review/rw7091918/?ref_=tt_urv
