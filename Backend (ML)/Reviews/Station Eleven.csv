9 February 2022,knedb,6," What happened???
","The first two seasons were awesome. Very good writing. Now with the third and especially the fourth season, the writing is horrible. Everything is overly dramatic. Pretty much every cast member annoys me now. I'm guessing the show got new writers after the second season. If that's the case, then they should have end the show there. Where did all the creativity go???",/review/rw7589202/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,Stephanie4040,6," This isn't Star Trek
","The writers have created too many millennial self-indulgent characters who lack confidence, need constant praise, are awkward and are constantly talking about their feelings. It's like a high school teen show set in the Star Trek universe. The first 4 episodes of S4 was just characters crying, second guessing themselves and over acting. Its like having an entire cast of Wesley Crusher's. It's such a disappointment! Yet, the same writers are involved in Picard, and they have absolutely got that right. The casting isn't that great on Discovery either. Tilly and Saru are excellent, but without Michelle Yeoh it's not really that good anymore. Looking forward to the spin off - I have a feeling that will be better.",/review/rw7589202/?ref_=tt_urv

","...but this doesn't mean I'm obsessed with it. I just loved the universe with everything it holds - yeah SciFi rules - but honestly, after watching many times the old series I was kinda bored with the whole ""bridge action"" feeling like everything happened in a room.

5 March 2019,syncopatedrhythm,10," Don't bury it until you start season 2
","Ok, I get the hate for season 1. Didn't seem like Trek to me either. That being said season 2 seems to get things back on the Trek track for me. Capt Pike alone saves it for me, wrapping part of the story line in TOS story arc helps. Give it a try and don't judge it on season 1 alone. To all those complaining we don't see enough story about the bridge crew ask yourself just how much of TOS focused on the bridge crew. They were almost window dressing confined to repeating the same lines each week as the screen hog Shatner cut a ton of their lines, hailing frequencies open, shields up, aye Captain.....etc. No story's focused on them. Sure Next Generation gave us individual focused stories but not the original series. Anyways I like the direction season 2 is taking, try it. Sorry ignore all the above, the series takes a huge dump in season 3 and 4. Worst Trek ever.",/review/rw7589202/?ref_=tt_urv

",Never have been so bored to death of hearing stupid speeches. Every 10 minutes there's a big speech about what there going in to and how important it is. Yeah yeah we got after 50th speech we didn't need another 100. Make a sci-fi program not political bull crap.,/review/rw7589202/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2022,riverzak,6," Season 4 is slipping
","So far season 2 has been the best of the series. While season 4 has an interesting story arc, I am seeing far too much time spent on characters having heart to heart discussions. This is Star Trek, not group therapy. It seems no crisis is too dire or time critical that time can't be taken for inappropriate (in the moment) conversation. Billions of lives are at stake but let's pause for several minutes to tug at the old heart strings, or perhaps just to pad the show out to a full episode.",/review/rw7589202/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2021,supermellowcali,2," Season 4: emotional drama displaces scifi
","Apparently TV shows are made for younger kids these days. This show is so well produced that it's a shame it's become so boring, having gone way too far with teaching social correctness to young kids and sacrificing a good scifi story for a vision of the future with fleet crew members straight from daytime soap operas, too preoccupied with their emotional fragility to be competent. Ninjas vs Diabetics? In a sword fight? On a starship? Please. Stop it. I wish instead they'd capitalize more on the bold ideas, story elements and humor past shows have had... that appeal to all ages.",/review/rw7589202/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2017,grumpy-3,8," i was going to wait to watch a few more episodes but after ep 3 had to write
","i have to agree with all the accurate and negative comments on this show,what a disgrace and an insult to the star trek universe. everything about this show is bad, starting with the worst writing and plot lines, actually what plot, hardly anything happens. in ep 3 there literally was no plot, just boring character interaction, and what a bunch of loser and depressing characters we have, it has been said in other posts but its worth repeating, there is not one likable person so far on this show, everyone hates everyone, they all have personal agendas. the writing and acting is amateur dramatics. i thought Enterprise was bad, but compared to this it could be a masterpiece. so far netflix have not delivered as far as i am concerned on anything, stranger things i thought was crap, the expanse boring rubbish, marco polo a yawn fest, and on and on, the comedies are not that much better, mostly its the writing in all their stuff that just does not make the grade",/review/rw7589202/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2021,krowe33,7," Should be called Whisper Trek
","I watched the first three seasons and kinda liked the show at first. But as the episodes went on, the constant whispering by the actors just began to annoy me. Are they afraid someone will hear their ðŸ’© acting? Is there someone sleeping on the set they are trying not to wake? Does the script call out (whispers) before every freakin line? I don't know, but it seems to be an attempt at dramatization that I just can't take anymore.",/review/rw7589202/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2022,adaptor,2," Not Star Trek
","This series is just wrong in so many different ways. It is less related to the Star Trek canon than JJ Abrams' turds were. This is raw Star-Trek-ploitation. Perhaps it could have been enjoyable if it were called something else and didn't try to awkwardly force itself into a mold it wasn't designed to fit into... If you like Star Trek, check out Star Trek Continues, New Voyages, or Lower Decks for better offerings in the Star Trek universe.",/review/rw7589202/?ref_=tt_urv

","This TV series is just not not right and does not follow any resemblance to the originals series, and certainly not a very good prequel. The script lacks any plot or theme and the acting is unbelievably poor at it's best. Absolutely terrible. Cannot believe the overall rating.

","At first I thought that this was a bad show, but when I watched it again after almost 4 months, it turned out it is not that bad, now I'm on ep 14. And I have to say, I really like it, I don't even know, what it is about it, that I disliked so much, polrobably that it is so different from previous startreks, but now that I started again, I like it a lot, so, for those who had the same opinion about this show as me, try watching it again.

","I just cannot believe this tripe, you just cannot make this stuff up; when in doubt just plagiarize an element from DUNE which used Spice from a worm to bend space-time.

25 September 2017,dongwangfu,8," Lots of potential
","Having just watched the first two episodes, I want to chime in on behalf of those people who have seen every episode of every series, but who are not ""purists"" about Star Trek. Frankly, these first episode were much better than my admittedly low expectations. On the positive side, there are at least three characters that are fleshed out, given backstories, and show some development. There is a story arc, one that reminds me of the one with the Cardassians in DS9. Finally, and I don't know how to say this any better, but there is a welcome dearth of stupid bangles -- no holosuites, no tribbles, no Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis romance. On the negative side, there is a lot more action than discovery, and while in many people's eyes that made ""First Contact"" a winning entry in the series, there is something that fails about that approach when one is forced to watch commercials every seven minutes. This lack of puzzles is echoed by a crew member who says something like ""we were supposed to be on a journey of exploration not a war,"" which was my sentiment throughout the JJ movies, and so I hope there is more ""discovery"" in the rest of the series.",/review/rw7589202/?ref_=tt_urv
