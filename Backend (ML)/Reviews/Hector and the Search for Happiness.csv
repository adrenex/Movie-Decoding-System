28 July 2022,lewislaura-49881,10," Loved it!
","The actresses are the movie! The chemistry between them is electric. I know people will say stuff about the ending being bad but it's not necessarily a bad ending. I mean take it as you want but when Jaime says ""not gonna let me go?"" and Marike shakes her head meaning no. I take that as she's not going to let her slip away this time. The story line of course wasn't the best we've seen it before but like I said above the actress makes this movie. More people need to see this film.",/review/rw8547986/?ref_=tt_urv

4 August 2022,fergteano,10," Amazing film
","Damn, what a great film. From the undeniable chemistry between the two leads, fantastic score, amazing cinematography and a script that a lot of queer people can definitely relate it's no doubt that this movie deserves to go places and I can't wait to watch it again once it hits streaming.",/review/rw8547986/?ref_=tt_urv

30 September 2022,potato_dream,10," Unexpectedly beautiful and nuanced film
","This is a really beautiful film that leaves a lasting impact. It has wonderful acting, incredible music, and lots of satisfying little details that make rewatching it a joy. Despite the setup being a bit sad, it is somewhat of a comfort movie: there are no explosive reveal scenes where the couple's private moments are interrupted, nobody says anything homophobic, and nobody dies. The actors are excellent at conveying the intensity of first love, and despite having no religious background or interest, I really connected to the story (which is somewhat rare). I hope this film gets the platform it deserves and will become available internationally.",/review/rw8547986/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,gk303007,7," Above okayish
","The movie started and took top gear within matter of minutes. I felt few scenes were just for the sake, but that's okay. Eventually, all that hurry was to get straight to one point: the chemistry between the two leads.",/review/rw8547986/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,torresallison-74076,10," Watched it twice in 2 days
","To me, this is the female version of Call Me By Your Name and currently my favorite movie. I keep thinking about the deep scenes. I wish I could watch it for the first time again. I wish I could pay to stream it but had to watch on Telegram, thanks to Tik Tok for the tip! Jaime, the lead actress, made me fall in love with her. The music for extremely well with each scene and the shots that were taken were absolutely stunning and make me want to go to the sites. This is a coming of age movie that will break your heart and make you so happy all at the same time. I will continue watching it whenever I'm feeling down!",/review/rw8547986/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2022,mandrakk-66962,3," Another cliche sad lesbian story
","As we all know how this story goes; two girls fall in love; they can't be together and later gets separated; one marries a man, while the other leaves and later at the end of the movie they meet and cry looking at each other. The end.",/review/rw8547986/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,Angroboda,3," Why?
","This film went for too long. It could've been a short film and send the same message in a more powerful way. But no, they had to go and keep us seated for 1h30-ish and, frankly, give no clue whatsoever about a lot of things. They managed to squeeze in a lot of sub-plots that were never explained, and got stuck to a single plot-line, that dragged along the entire film. The scenes were sometimes badly played, or had no feeling behind them, and the same thing can be said about the characters, in certain situations. The actors seemed forced to act, and, overall, the film had an tremendous feeling of longingness that, unfortunatelly, was poorly taken advantage of.",/review/rw8547986/?ref_=tt_urv
