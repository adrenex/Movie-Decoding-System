19 October 2019,themoviedoctor,5," This is definitely a children's movie.
","I am an avid fan of the Addams family, and rewatch their movies each Halloween season. When I saw there was to be an animated re-make, I pictured it to be a mixture of the timelessness of their previous films and the entertainment of The Nightmare Before Christmas - fun for the whole family. However, as a young adult, I was not in the least bit entertained. The story line was definitely created for children, depicting the importance of inclusion/acceptance and family bond. Which I'm sure is very important for the younger generations. Yet I just was unable to connect with my long-standing enthusiasm for the Addams family during this movie.",/review/rw5196862/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2019,DeadMansTrousers,7," Entertaining enough
","The intention here is obviously to introduce a new generation to the Addams Family. The film starts completely fresh and tells the origins of the entire family as a stand alone film. As someone who grew up watching the 90s films, cartoons, and re-runs I actually didn't mind this. They presented a straightforward well contained story that has plenty of jokes for both children and adults, which I laughed at enough of to stay entertained throughout the film.",/review/rw5196862/?ref_=tt_urv

",The Addams Family ... it's been a while since I saw the live Action movie. And I think I only saw the first movie and not the show or anything else. Still the music is quite iconic ... and it gets introduced here in a very funny way too.,/review/rw5196862/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2019,stevendbeard,7," Based on the 1938 Cartoons
","I saw ""The Addams Family"", starring the voices of Oscar Isaac-Poe Dameron in the Star Wars movies, The Bourne Legacy; Charlize Theron-Atomic Blonde, The Legend of Bagger Vance; Chloe Grace Moretz-Greta, The Equalizer; Allison Janney-Mom_tv, 10 Things I Hate About You and Finn Wolfhard-the new It movies, Stranger Things_tv.
This is an animated version of the 1938 popular Charles Addams series of cartoons about a ghoulish family that moves to New Jersey. There was a live action tv series and a few live action movies and animated tv series and specials over the years but this is the first animated theatrical release. Oscar voices the father of the family Gomez, Charlize is his wife Morticia, Chloe is their daughter Wednesday and Finn is their son Pugsley, each with their own twisted behaviors and mannerisms. After moving to New Jersey-they had problems with their neighbors in the old country-the Addams family try to fit in but Allison, the local celebrity, doesn't make it easy for them. The character artwork is influenced by the original 1938 cartoons and there is plenty of the ghoulish style of humor that you are probably familiar with from previous incarnations. There are also other cameo voices you might recognize-Snoop Dogg, Bette Midler, Nick Kroll and Martin Short just to name a few. Whether you are a fan-I am-or not, you should enjoy this interpretation.
It's rated ""PG"" for macabre and suggestive humor and some action and has a running time of 1 hour & 27 minutes.
I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",/review/rw5196862/?ref_=tt_urv

12 October 2019,mr_bickle_the_pickle,8," Snaps for Addams Family
","I thought this was a horrifyingly good time. I thought it was funny and got some genuine laughs out of me. Yes, there are jokes that are going to be more geared towards kids like fart jokes for instance...it is a family movie afterall. But plenty little nods and winks for the adults to enjoy as well. It had nice message to it as well..embracing people for who they are and all, and there was some possible coding in the movie that I thought was interesting too. I didnt bring any kids with me but this was plenty of them in my theater and they seem to be quite engaged with the story and were laughing along with it. There were a couple of things - mostly character wise - that didnt always ring true. Like at one point (as Wednesday is going through a bit of rebellious phase) decides to run away...and you'd think the family would like that sort of thing considering how opposite they are to modern society. But they don't. That didnt really detract from my overall enjoyment though.",/review/rw5196862/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2019,DanielNeil1237,4," Very average animated film with a few good moments
","The Addams family 2019 is a very run of the mill animated film that ends up feeling very average.
Being a major fan of The Addams Family from the original films from the 90s I was really disappointed with the film. Our story follows the entire Addams family years after they have moved into their mansion being hidden there for years after being chased away by angry civilians. Now since to a new house flip tv show, they are discovered with the show host wanting to destroy their house to make it fit in with the neighborhood. On top of that Pugsly Addams is having to prepare to do a famous sword pattern that is a tradition to prove he is truly an Addams. In front of the entire Addams family and all their relatives. This subplot with Pugsly is one of many there is even another one about Wednesday Addams trying to fit in at school becoming an issue with the film having too many subplots. The main message of the film is one we have heard 100 times with accepting people in your town who are different because we are all unique in our own ways. This is a good message for kids but the message is shoved in way too much, and they don't reinvent the presentation of the message in any way, or try anything new to make it more interesting. I thought the film never fully did the characters justice especially the family relationship aspect. It had a few great performances that being Chole Grace Moretz as Wednesday Addams and Charlize Theron as Morticia Addams. Some of the imagery can be pretty cool with the house, using the character designs from the original comic strip and some scenes have good humor. Major issues with the film are in the story being extremely basic and not taking many risks. With like I mentioned earlier way too many subplots that can be extremely uninteresting. Overall The Addams family ends up being just okay with a few good moments sprinkled throughout but having an extremely basic story and not going all the way with the family's classic humor, dark style.",/review/rw5196862/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2020,cherold,5," has its moments, but too few
","This version of The Addams Family takes its look from the original Charles Addams and it characters and many gags from the TV series, but it doesn't seem to entirely understand either, resulting in a movie of broad, often juvenile humor without a consistent vision.",/review/rw5196862/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2020,ashaleymorrison-58882,1," Not the Addams Family at all.
","There was glimpses in the film that reminded me of the traditional Addams family. But truly the entirety of this film tried way too hard & completely missed the mark. It was extremely cringey & upsetting for anyone who grew up with the traditional Addams family. From the soundtrack to the film which was absurdly pop-y & so obviously forced into the film to reach the younger generation. To the voice actors chosen, Chloe Grace is too bubble gum & you could feel how awkward & forced it was for her to voice someone out of her range, Charlize Theron who constantly applied peaks & valleys during her lines that made Morticia seem stuck up & judgmental, Issac as Gomez was a plain flop, Finn as Pugsley was too ""leave it to beaver"", but Nick Kroll did fantastic as Uncle Fester. The voice actors chosen were sadly picked to be a star cast to bring in their large, mainstream fan base but they are typecast actors at their core. The plot of of the film being Wednesday wanting to go mingle & meet with the people in the city far below but couldn't because her parents are being controlling over her to never leave their home because their criticized for being monsters sounds too familiar. Because it is. This plot for an ""angsty"" teen girl to go against her parents has been over done & was most recently done in the first film of the Hotel Transylvania series. When in other Addams Family medias, they are portrayed as individuals who applaud differences & are confident in who they are that they don't want or need to hide. No Addams thinks they're above any other Addams, like the one ancestor judging Pugsley for his monster barmitzvah. Deeply disturbed by the Addams allowing their house to be painted pink because the most cited quote from Morticia is that black is such a happy color. If anything, instead of doing a played out children's theme for the movie, I would've enjoyed it more if they took a plot idea from one of the episodes from the original series to build a movie around. I appreciated the animation style to match Charles Addams original New Yorker style & grandmama being Gomez's mother like it was originally vs being Morticia's in later medias. I also appreciated the ending scene doing the exact intro sequence for the 1964 tv show, that was a good nod to the show. But the mark was sadly so missed, if they took more time to establish a better soundtrack that fit the Addams family, picked voice actors based on talent that properly suited the Addams family & what they stand for (not because of their fame or relevancy at the time), & created a plot that followed the morals & values of the Addams family that wasn't so cheesy, forced & absolutely incorrect with the Addams family nature, then they would've done great. And if you're questioning the validity or nature of the the reviewer, this is a review from a girl who as a child idolized Wednesday Addams & wanted to be her when she grew up, never a Disney princess.",/review/rw5196862/?ref_=tt_urv

","Gomes and Morticia Addams move to a derelict mansion in New Jersey surrounded by a marsh and hidden by a fog in the top of a mountain to raise a family. Thirteen years later, Gomes is teaching his son Pugslay the saber tradition of the Addams family while Wednesday is questioning her mother about the world outside the mansion gate. Meanwhile a community is raised by Margaux Needler, who is the responsible for the sales of the house, and the marsh is drained. When she sees the old mansion on the neighborhood, she decides to get rid of the Addams Family.",/review/rw5196862/?ref_=tt_urv

","After getting a couple of live action versions of ""The Addams Family'' in the 90's (which I loved), we get an animated version. Gomez (voiced by Oscar Isaac) is still crazy in love with Morticia (voiced by Charlize Theron). Wednesday (voiced by Chloe Grace Moretz) is still a monotone harbinger of doom and Pugsley (voiced by Finn Wolfhard) is still the frequent object of Wednesday's experiments to get rid of him.",/review/rw5196862/?ref_=tt_urv

13 June 2020,sbweightman,3," A pale imitation of the source material.
","Dull and boring with a voice cast who don't seem to be putting in any effort. It's a pale imitation of the classic show with a weak story and poor attempts at humour which only get slightly better as it goes along. One or two jokes work, but It's mostly flat; the comic violence is neither funny or violent and the horror isn't remotely scary or shocking. The distorted bodies art style is too distracting and the modern hip hop completely out of place with the premise.",/review/rw5196862/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2019,betchaareoffendedeasily,," Reviews Here Are Deceptive.
","I enjoyed most of the film. It is not perfect. the biggest gripe is that I can tell that the original screenplay was re-written. Now, as a child could I tell this? NO, and that is the primary audience. I think adults forget when they watch a movie primarily targeted to children that it will not totally appeal to them. Now, some exceptions to my enjoyment of children's films is the new terrible 2018 Grinch, which was so bad I could tell even the children were not entertained and I actually walked out of theater, this coming from an adult whom enjoys children's films. The problem with the Addams Family, lies in the two major plots, that of Margeaux, and that of Wednesday, the former feels resolved, and the latter does not, I solely blame script revisions on this, there are indeed 5 screenwriters named according to IMDB.",/review/rw5196862/?ref_=tt_urv

","Look, I like kids films. Simple, funny. Pixar nails it, Illumination is a close second, but I'll say that even the subpar Abominable was better than this. This was...what? Halloween? A dig on HGTV? A chance for actors to make a paycheck between blockbusters by lending their voices to make a decent cast? I rate kids movies based on the reactions by my kids. I've never seen my kid sit for 90 minutes waiting for a punchline then look at me wondering if we're supposed to leave or stay for the movie to make a point.",/review/rw5196862/?ref_=tt_urv
