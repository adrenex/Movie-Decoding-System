17 September 2019,braquecubism,9," reading some of the 1 star reviews
","Comedy is very personal. I think it's harder than drama- as to tastes- I think something is over sweet or too salty and it's some one else's favorite food. Often, I can't get a single laugh from some comics others think are funny.
I can't say all the skits are even; some better. Is it ha ha funny, not always. But I found it entertaining and original. and I like a different voice. they break through sexual and social stereotypes by displaying them. Carrie as a man and Fred as a woman pull it off, not by their physical, but by the spirit and mimic of the essence.",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2012,lee_eisenberg,8," from the eyes of a native
","""Portlandia"" is a parody of/homage to the City of Roses, depicting scenarios that look like typical Portland occurrences. ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member Fred Armisen and singer Carrie Brownstein play various characters that truly represent the city, with occasional guest stars. This is not a sitcom in the common sense. It's filmed on location, and the humor is sort of like the kind in Christopher Guest's movies. ""Portlandia"" isn't a masterpiece of a show, but it's a very fun look at my hometown. I can affirm that it's a pretty accurate portrayal. And a very funny one. This show probably won't be for everyone, but if you like quirky stuff then you'll probably enjoy it.",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2011,jjnoahjames,9," Portlandia defines a generation. Let me rephrase.
","Portlandia is a sketch comedy show that contains two main characters played by Fred Armisen of SNL fame and Carrie Brownstein of popular band Sleater Kinney. These two come up with rad skits in which they play Hippy Vegans, Cult members, Cos Play characters, and Yuppies just to name a few. Every episode contains famous actors, which add to the fun!!",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2011,salvodaze,10," Above the standards for a sketch show
","Sketch shows are generally not my thing since they tend to follow a tradition of being campy. Portlandia, on the other hand, is damn straight (and most importantly consistently) funny. I mean where else could I look to see a smart parody of a radical feminist lesbian played by a feminist lesbian? Or catch a glimpse of Kaia Wilson as a cafe customer during a sketch? I realize that these are partially (OK so the latter, completely) personal reasons to enjoy the show only more. However I think that anyone who enjoys absurd comedy with some social criticism would really appreciate the show.",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2012,dunks58,10," ""Just one more episode ...""
","If you like sketch comedy but have not yet discovered this series, take my advice - see this show. 'Portlandia' is, for me at least, the best American sketch comedy series I've seen since 'Upright Citizens Brigade'.",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2017,cherold,8," Amazing at its best, although it's become more hit and miss over the years
","Portlandia is a wonderful mockery of a sort of the silliness of the modern age, poking fun at obsessions with food and authenticity and playing with concepts of gender. ",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2012,qormi,6," First season: 10 stars...Second season - 2 stars
","This show completely cracks me up. The strange characters portrayed by these talented people are too funny. The subtle humor and lack of a laugh track is something that is lacking on television. The mayor is a total pretentious jerk that probably reminds a lot of us of our bosses. The bizarre humor in the show is completely original and unrelenting. I hate it when they have back-to-back episodes on Saturday mornings because I can't get out of bed - can't turn it off. The bookstore women, the cult, the dumpster divers, the gender-reversed couple, the Portland ""Thinkers""....too funny. It's the best thing to hit television since ""Fernwood 2 Nite"", circa 1975. This just in...the second season sucked. I removed 4 stars.",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2021,margiehalls,10," god I love this show
","I think the funniest sketch of all time is the pretentious thrift store one, and that alone gives this show a 10. Brownstein and Armisen are the best comic duo in recent memory - there unique brand of irreverent humor is so smart and can be so delightfully crass at the same time. Also the running format of the show is so brilliant. Want more of this!!",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2021,Erik_Stone,9," Historic
","Spot on. It's like a documentary, because it predicts the future, like the rest of us already knew, and why we escaped years ago. It's nice to be able to laugh at dead-baby jokes and the holocaust . . . Thankfully, welcome to Portlandia, which is even more funny, because it's more realistic.",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2017,grantss,8," Funny, clever and original comedy, though a bit hit-and-miss at times
","Written by and starring Carrie Brownstein, of Sleater-Kinney fame, and Fred Armisen, of Saturday Night Live fame, a sketch comedy show set in Portland, Oregon. ",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2021,dbarr123,10," This show is SO annoyingly funny!
","ðŸ˜‚Ha. Every scene is sarcastic humor. This show is so much fun to watch. You are literally never bored watching this. You can start anywhere because there virtually isn't a plot. This is a ""sitcom"". ""Situation comedy"".",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2018,grandmahawk,8," If you gave this lower than a 7, you just don't get it
","This show is incredibly funny. It is very dry, and there is no laugh track, so if you aren't into that type of humor/show, this isn't the show for you. They are particularly good at making fun of hipster overly sensitive liberal culture, while also making fun of the other side of the isle. There is something in each episode for every type of person. Sometimes, the humor isn't obvious. It isn't quotable. Its not something you can go tell your friends or share on twitter. A lot of it relies in the actual plot itself, or the subtle delivery from the actors. Sometimes it makes fun of movies, TV shows, or other traditional forms of entertainment. It doesn't stick to making fun of one type of person, and it doesn't stick to one type of humor. If you have a broad sense of humor or can at least appreciate their varying forms of humor, you'll love this show. If you only think very specific types of humor are funny, you won't like this. This show is brilliant, creative, and doesn't care about if it hurts your feelings.",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2011,flapdoodle64,4," Boring, corny and unfunny, disguised as indie/hipster fare.
","The creators of this show made some accurate and pithy observations regarding the culture of Portland, Oregon, capturing our local native vibe that is sometimes quirky and sincere, sometimes obsessive, and sometimes down right passive-aggressive. As a 13-year resident of Portland, I appreciate this, as I appreciate location shots and the cameo appearance of our beleaguered Mayor Sam Adams.",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2015,robertmaybeth,8," You'll either love it or hate it.
","THIS ONE MIGHT HAVE SPOILERS! ""Portlandia"" - It's not for everybody. That's the first sign you might find it good viewing. The second sign is it may take time to grow on you. It takes you out of your viewing comfort zone right away and a lot of people don't like that. My wife can't watch it. The first thing you'll notice is ""Portlandia"" is really the ""Fred and Carrie show"". These two mesh though, so they can pull it off. And they aren't concerned at all about looking ridiculous or even idiotic for a laugh. Sometimes the formula of straight absurdity just doesn't work - but it works enough of the time to keep me tuning back in. ",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2012,scottrowley1643,8," Brilliant
","This is brilliant. It is so offbeat and quirky..very enjoyable. It may not be for everyone but you'll know right away if it's for you. The writing is so good. This isn't your ridiculous run-of-the-mill network comedy. You have met some of the characters before...self involved do-gooders, aged hippies, counter culture losers, the politically correct, protect the dogs but forget the people, people variously stuck in the 70s,80s and 90s all offbeat and most amusing. Portlandia will not appeal to people who enjoy: Jersey Shore, 2 1/2 Men, WWE. It may appeal to people who like: Walking Dead, Jericho, Breaking Bad. However, give it a go...you will know...""the dream of the 90s is alive in Portland"".",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2015,saboyagregory,10," Armisen and Brownstein at their finest
","I never would have guessed that punk rocker Carrie Brownstein was this funny, and as for Fred Armisen, after 12 years on SNL, I naturally assumed those to be the peak of Armisen's sketch comedy genius, but then: Portlandia.",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2011,scarletminded,2," I actually fast forwarded through this to see Kyle MacLachlan!!
","I didn't have the highest hopes for this show since SNL is not that funny anymore. But I gave it a shot. The first episode wasn't funny at all, which lead me to believe this show isn't a comedy. Is it? I mean, the beginning part with the singing was so long and not humorous. Then the characters were flat and in the bookstore, in took me awhile to realize Fred Armisen was playing a woman. See, if you watched a Kids in the Hall skit, you would instantly know a guy was playing a female. In this, I didn't. If there are jokes in this show, I must be missing them all. Wait, there are no jokes.",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv

15 April 2019,emymc-35438,10," Well Worth 10 Stars
","This sketch comedy show has it all! It's witty, comical, intriguing, and addictive. Every single episode can stand alone or follow the preceding episode. Amazingly funny and worth binge watching multiple times over and over. I only wish more shows had this much thoughtful comedy.",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2011,nazztrader,9," Hit and Miss, but the Hits are Big !
","I often find myself more interested in writing a highly critical review, mostly because I'm irritated by a film that cost a lot of money yet was awful, but this TV show deserves some commentary. Now don't get me wrong, this show has a lot of ""misses."" And it's not for those with a more traditional sense of humor, or who mostly enjoy crude, low-brow humor apparently meant for the teen crowd. However, I like absurd, bizarre humor, especially if it's got some social commentary, and at times Portlandia is very funny.",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2019,braquecubism,9," original thinking- performances writing
","I watched these a few years ago- so I can't compare the 1st and following seasons.
Fred and Carrie do a lot of gender bending- and have a unique voice- visiting common themes. they confront the ordinary joe, jill and the ""hippy dippy""- taking a fresh look. as to be expected, some skits hit better than others. they take chances.",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2016,fistamamanbush,1," Painfully dull and unfunny
","One of those safe shows you hear everyone raving about. I gave this several chances, as I wondered what I was missing. All of the gags are DOA, I've never once even smirked at this safe pablum. I think the popularity of this God awful show is that everything safe, and all the humor, if you can call it that, is aimed at millennials. The jokes are based on observational humor specifically hipster culture in portland, which is just hipster culture. The problem is that all all the gags are nerfed, there isn't a single biting, or sharp observation in this show. Every single ""jab"" at these hipster conventions is gentle and designed for the hipsters to laugh at, because they are in on the joke. Also, all the targets are stereotypes so broad, this show needn't take place in Portland as all the jokes are totally generic, and run for far too long. This show feels like SNL - lame sketches that overstay their welcome. Jesus they did an ENTIRE episode about a bit where a lady didn't want to eat Tsukemen a certain way and the noodles came to life in a painfully tedious and unfunny episode length sketch that should have lasted 3 minutes at most. This show is just bizzzzaaaad.",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2017,kingbk-2,6," Funny at First, Not So Much Anymore
","I'm not from Portland, but I live there now. Portland is a beautiful place to live. Breathtaking scenery, an excellent public transit system, awesome restaurants, great beer and coffee, close proximity to mountains and the ocean. There's a lot to like about living here. Sure, it rains a lot, there are a lot of homeless people, and hipsters are pretentious douchebags, but most people are hard working, friendly and inclusive. Some people get annoyed by the ""small town"" locals and some people get annoyed by the ""yuppies for California."" I think most people are good people in this city. IFC plays on many of the Portland sensibilities in their satire sketch comedy show ""Portlandia"".",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv

","If Portlandia was Game of Thrones the city would be High Garden.
A wonderful comedy sketch show with a running theme, the theme being the irony of real world city Portland.",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2013,MisterMattToYou,1," Kyle MacLachlan nails it but the rest fall short.
","Kyle MacLachlan goes all in on his portrayal of the simple but always charming, Mayor of Portland. Unfortunately even MacLachlan's powerful performance wasn't enough to carry the show with Armisen's dry, bland, and all around boring characters that just don't fit the bill.",/review/rw2890557/?ref_=tt_urv
