17 October 2005,ccthemovieman-1,10," Fabulous Thriller That Endures
","This a one of the best thriller/suspense/action films I have ever watched, and I've seen tons of them for almost 50 years. It ""endures"" because it is just as entertaining on the sixth viewing as it is on the first.",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2004,philip_vanderveken,9," Good acting and directing, constant action and tension. Even after many years this movie still stands
","""The Fugitive"" is one of those movies that you may already have seen a dozen of times, but which still seems to surprise every time that you watch it. I don't know what it actually is that makes this movie so good, but it sure works. It's probably the combination of a good script, good acting and the abundance of action that's always present, but never exaggerated.",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2003,cariart,," One of the Great Thrillers!
","There is a kind of magic when a superb cast, a truly gifted director, and a literate script with equal parts 'over-the-top' action, riveting suspense, and rich characterization, come together. The end result attains a luster that only grows through the years, as new audiences, through DVD and VHS, experience the same excitement we felt, viewing it on a theater screen. In the last decade, only a handful of suspense films could be called 'great'...and on top of the list is THE FUGITIVE.",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 1999,baumer,10," Pure action and Tommy Lee Jones make this an unforgettable masterpiece
","Arnold and Sly are great action heroes.  Their characters are always larger than life.  Rambo and Rocky are household names and The Terminator and films like Commando are great partly because of Arnold's physical presence.  But as good as they are, I don't think they can hold a candle to Harrison Ford. Sure he is in great shape, but have you ever seen an actor take average guys and make them so real that you want to know them?  Take your pick, Han Solo, Indy and even his character in Six Days and Seven Nights was an adventurer. Add Richard Kimble to that list.  As Kimble, Ford is perfect.  He is the wronged man that has to avenge his wife's death and clear his name at the same time.  He is so great in this film and I'm sure that's why so many people went to see this film at first.  But I think what kept them coming back was Tommy Lee Jones.  We'll get to him in a minute.",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2001,Doylenf,," Fast-paced action thriller is even superior to the TV series...
","For a good ""chase"" film, you can't beat 'The Fugitive'. Not all films taken from TV series manage to make it to the big screen with a style of their own and a story worth telling. Exceptionally fine performances by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are the icing on the cake. The picture scores on all levels: photography, music, editing, script and performances. The bus/train crash at the start is a spectacular piece of filmmaking that gets the story off to a good start with powerful urgency. While you're rooting for Ford all the way, as the doctor wrongly accused of the murder of his wife, you sometimes find yourself in the shoes of the crafty, quirky detective with a sense of humor (Tommy Lee Jones) who is relentless in his pursuit. The battle between the pursued and the pursuer is the dominant theme and it is carried off with great wit and style.",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 1999,movieman9,10," One of the best action movies of the decade; Ford and Jones are in top form.
","Nothing is more thrilling to see than two characters with superior intelligences, pitting their wits against each other. A thriller does not require a great deal of plot or techno-babble to be involving or complex, although many distributors of blockbusters today seem to think so. For these reasons, ""The Fugitive"" is a huge blessing for a movie critic such as I. I was just thrilled by the excitement, the performances by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, and the whole Hitchcockian aura that this sensational film delivered. Even though we have been seeing too many films based on television series come out lately, ""The Fugitive"" is certainly not one of those that we can add to that routine bushel.",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2003,DennisLittrell,7," Excellent thriller
","This is a fine vehicle for Harrison Ford made even more agreeable by a clever, somewhat tongue in cheek performance by Tommy Lee Jones as a US Marshall out to have a good time getting the bad guy, even though the bad guy might not be so bad, and even though that's irrelevant, but hey, don't think so much and get me some coffee and a chocolate donut with those sprinkles on top, ya hear?",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2000,Quinoa1984,10," The most intense picture of the decade
","The Fugitive is the biggest heart-pounding thriller I have seen in a while (and the best one this decade).  The story revolves around Dr. Richard Kimble, played by Harrison Ford to pythagorean procision.  Kimble is accused of killing his wife and is chased all over Chicago by Marshalls while looking for his wife's one armed killer.  One of these Marshalls is Samuel Gerarg (Tommy Lee Jones terrific and Oscar nod performance) who after a while believes he is innocent. ",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2008,blanche-2,8," Great thriller
","Harrison Ford is ""The Fugitive"" in this 1993 version of the popular television series. The film also stars Tommy Lee Jones as Gerard, Sela Ward, Julianne Moore and Joe Pantoliano. For you young 'uns out there, ""The Fugitive"" TV show starring David Janssen was based on the 1954 Sam Sheppard case, the subject itself of 10 books and two movies. Dr. Sheppard. accused of murdering his wife, claimed to have seen a ""bushy-haired man"" at the scene. It was a landmark case, resulting in the creation of the ""change of venue"" motion.",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2019,bkoganbing,8," The premises of the TV series
","Back in the 60s I tuned into ABC TV on Tuesday night to see how David Janssen as
Dr. Richard Kimble would once again escape the clutches of the law. Kimble was a convicted murderer who escaped execution in a train wreck. Once out Kimble
searches for a one armed man he saw leaving his home where his dead wife was
who can clear him. Searching for single wing and avoiding the cops was what was
behind every episode for four years.",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2005,NewEnglandPat,8," A great chase thriller with star power
","This excellent film details the adventure of a man's search for his wife's killer and to clear himself of her murder. Harrison Ford is the hero and wanted man and on the run to escape capture by a determined U.S. Marshal in one thrilling scene after another. A spectacular train wreck with a bus of prison-bound felons gets the action underway at which point Tommy Lee Jones enters the picture and takes over the film by sheer force of personality and doesn't let go. Harrison, a resourceful type, stays just ahead of Jones in this taut cat-and-mouse thriller and adroitly leaves just enough clues for the police as he closes in on the killer. Ford and Jones are well matched here in one of the best urban crime mysteries ever filmed. Cast and Chicago locations add realism to a great story.",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2010,Aaron1375,9," Thankfully this version of ""The Fugitive"" wraps up in two hours rather than a couple of seasons.
","This was a thoroughly enjoyable movie that has good acting, a good story, and good action. Based on the television show of the same name it is also probably the most successful and best television show to movie I have ever seen. It also has that major plus in that at the end of the movie you are done with your journey and everything wraps up rather nicely. The story has Dr. Kimble accused of murder and we speed through the trial as the police do not believe for a minute Dr. Kimble's story of a fight he had with the actual killer, the one armed man. Well through some good and bad luck at the same time, he finds himself free of the prisoner transport he was on and now he is set loose to try and clear his name and bring the real killer to justice. On his trail though is a United States Marshall played by the very good actor Tommy Lee Jones. In fact, Jones would win an Oscar for his performance in this movie. He would later reprise this role, but with little success in the film ""U.S. Marshals"", my thinking is though that it might have done better at the box office had they not simply made almost a remake of this movie with the wrongly accused escapee, but instead had him track someone actually guilty of the crime. This one though has some great cat and mouse as you really pull for Kimble (played by the excellent Harrison Ford) to connect all the pieces and find the party responsible for his wife's death. Most of the action is confined to the city of Chicago I think it was, but there is enough action and such to make up for the lack of locales. Though there is a great scene involving a dam and the inner workings of it as Kimble is almost caught right off the bat by Gerard (the marshal). All in all a fine film and in my opinion still the best television show to movie film there is.",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2005,bob the moo,," A solidly enjoyable thriller with a solid plot and plenty of thrills and fun acting from a scene-stealing Jones
","When Dr Richard Kimble returns home to find his wife dying and an one-armed man fleeing the scene, nobody believes his story and he finds himself on a bus heading upstate for the rest of his life. When an accident finds him freed from his guards, the US Marshals are brought in to hunt him down. Slipping the net, Kimble starts to try and solve the murder by following up the clue that nobody else bothered to Â– the presence of the one-armed man.",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2017,Hey_Sweden,8," ""I didn't kill my wife!"" ""I don't care.""
","Roy Huggins' original 1960s TV series gets reinvented for the big screen, with engaging results. The premise is that an esteemed vascular surgeon, Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), is tried and convicted for the murder of his wife Helen (Sela Ward, in a pretty thankless role), despite his claims that he'd tussled with the REAL killer, a one-armed man (Andreas Katsulas). On his way to prison, Kimble seizes a chance to escape, and takes it on the lam. Naturally, he's determined to solve the crime, but almost always manages to stay one step ahead of the equally determined Federal marshal (Tommy Lee Jones) on his trail.",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2010,gary-444,10," Superb Action Thriller
","Probably the greatest modern post Hitchcock action thriller. A terrific cast led by two towering performances from Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones makes the most of an intelligent script and superb direction. The 60's television series provided a firm base for the story, but this feature length, densely plotted movie, takes proceedings to new heights of drama, and excellence.",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2020,Muhammad_Rafeeq,10," Such a great example of a Chase Thriller done right ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10
","The Fugitive is a modern classic - it takes the moral obligations of the law as well as a falsely accused 'fugitive' and melds them together into an action packed, beautifully scripted, intense thriller, which exceeds the watchability and originality of any other. I definitely recommend.",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2014,SnoopyStyle,8," Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones perfectly matched
","Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) is called in for an emergency surgery. When he returns home, he finds an one arm guy murdering his wife (Sela Ward). The cops don't believe him, and he is wrongly convicted. Kimble's prison transport crashes when the prisoners try to take over and is run over by a train. Kimble escapes and Deputy US Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) takes charge of catching Kimble. Meanwhile Kimble goes in search for his wife's killer.",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2012,friendbest128,8," Great Action Thriller starring Harrison Ford
","The Fugitive is a complex thriller with every detail playing a significant role in the outcome of the movie. It's the story of a conspiracy surrounding Dr. Richard Kimble, a surgeon who is on the run while U.S Marshal Samuel Gerard tries to find an explanation of why Kimble was framed for the murder of his wife. The movie has a sticking nature to it, every detail in the actors face will prove that Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones deserve every praise they have received for their performance.",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2017,Leofwine_draca,8," One of the best thrillers of the decade
","The 1990s wasn't exactly a decade known for quality cinema. Particularly in the second half of the decade, Hollywood became obsessed with poor quality CGI and the like and the quality of movies in general plummeted. However, in terms of action movies and thrillers, there were still plenty of interesting titles being released, none more so than THE FUGITIVE. A remake of the cult 1960s TV series, this blockbuster hit pitted hunter Tommy Lee Jones against wronged man Harrison Ford in a refreshingly adult and old-fashioned story that could have been directed by Hitchcock back in the day.",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2018,classicsoncall,9," ""I didn't kill my wife.""
","I'd only seen snippets of this movie in the past but never the entire picture until the other evening. I thought it was a well plotted thriller with only a couple of minor quibbles that distracted from the main story. One was when Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), on the run from Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard (Samuel Gerard), committed an unforced error by responding to the sound of his name on the staircase. The other was during the St. Patrick's Day Parade, Kimble sheds his heavy topcoat and when he heads out of the parade route, Gerard appears to have been walking closely behind without realizing it. My question would be - how and where would Kimble have discarded the coat without anyone noticing? ",/review/rw3218879/?ref_=tt_urv
