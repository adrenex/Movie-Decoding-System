",Wow. I was very surprised by this movie. This is the best movie I have seen about WW2 in a very long time. It really might rank up there with some of the best war movies.,/review/rw7008878/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2021,eddie_baggins,7," A well made Netflix war film
","One of the most expensive Dutch films ever produced and streaming kingpin Netflix's first originally produced film from the Netherlands, The Forgotten Battle is the perfect type of film for the company to support as well as being one of the most well put together war films in their catalogue.",/review/rw7008878/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,Red-125,8," Powerful, complex war movie
","De slag om de Schelde (2020) is a Dutch movie co-written and directed by
Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. It was shown in the U. S. with the title ""The Forgotten Battle."" The actual title translates as ""The Battle of the Scheldt."" We in the U. S. may never have heard of it. That's because Canadian troops bore the brunt of the battle against the Germans. I'm sure it's not a forgotten battle in Canada or Holland.",/review/rw7008878/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2022,deloudelouvain,8," Interesting WW II movie about a battle that has not been filmed before.
","Being from Belgium myself I found this movie very interesting to watch. De battle for the Schelde (a river in The Netherlands and Belgium that is the main entrance for the harbor of Antwerpen) is strategically very important. For once no battle of the bulge, Normandy, or other famous battles, but one that has not been filmed before. The Netherlands and Belgium don't release a lot of movies but when they do it's most of the time quality, and so is this one. You don't necessary have to have Hollywood budgets to make a good movie. Unknown actors (at least to the wider audience) performed really well in this war/drama. The battle scenes looked very realistic, hard and brutal. But it's not only about the battle scenes, it's also about the oppressor and the oppressed, what people felt like in those days and in that area. Zeeland is a beautiful part of The Netherlands and even though they filmed it in Lithuania (mostly because of budgetary problems) it really looked like Zeeland (a place I visited many times). De Slag Om De Schelde (or The Forgotten Battle for the English title) will please anyone that is interested in WW II, not only for Belgians and Dutch people.",/review/rw7008878/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2022,Instant_Palmer,9," Intimate Award-Winning Dutch Film on the ""Battle of the Scheldt"" in WWII (*Most of the dialogue is in English)
","Based on true events in Belgium/Netherlands of Allies recapturing the Port Of Antwerp, and the battle to expel the Germans forces still holding onto the critical North Sea seaport channel (the Scheldt) near the end of WWII in Europe.",/review/rw7008878/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2021,grantss,7," Interesting war drama
","September 1944. The Allies have captured the port of Antwerp but the Germans still control the Scheldt estuary, preventing supplies reaching Antwerp and the Allied forces. Walcheren Island is key to the German's defence. Operation Market Garden is launched, hoping to penetrate directly into Germany via Arnhem in Holland. A glider from this operation is forced to crash land on Walcheren, leaving a handful of British troops trapped behind enemy lines. Meanwhile a Dutch teenager accidentally kills three Germans, causing a tragic chain of events. On the German staff is a Dutch soldier who now starts to question where his loyalties lie.",/review/rw7008878/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2021,Holt344,9," The Forgotten Battle shows the horrors of war perfectly and is overall a great war film with stunning visuals, but the pacing could have been better
","The Forgotten Battle is a World War II film directed by Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. And written by Paula van der Oest. The film follows a British glider pilot, a Dutch boy fighting on the German side and a Dutch female resistance member who all end up involved in the Battle of the Scheldt that was fought in 1944. Their choices differ, but their goal is the same: freedom. We get to see the battle through these three perspectives, this storytelling is similar to what Christopher Nolan did with Dunkirk. But the similarities kind of ends there, the screenplay is flawed but it's mostly quite great. Where the film succeeds is the cinematography and direction, it's visually a very pleasing movie. It shows how it's become one of the most expensive Dutch films. I thought the film would focus mainly on the battle but I was wrong, it's about the people that the battle and war is affecting, a more human story which I'm totally behind. So it's more character driven than action heavy, but it's of course a war movie and that's shown brilliantly with imagery you'll continue to remember. But with it being focused on three perspectives, the pacing gets worse and it makes the film feel dragged out, story especially as events take too long of a time to build up. Maybe a shorter run time would have helped the film or a different screenplay that focused on mainly two perspectives, the Allies and Axis. But I'll admit that the story arc regarding Teuntje Visser is worthy to be told as it goes hand in hand with Marinus van Staveren's own character arc which is probably the film's best.",/review/rw7008878/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2021,paaskynen,8," A positive surprise
","Having seen a number of Dutch Second World War films, If have to say, I was positively surprised as to how close this film aimed to come to actual situations on the ground. Most of the island of Walcheren had been flooded by the Germans and by Allied bombing of the dikes. One of my uncles survived the battle for Vlissingen in a flooded cellar, floating with a tobacco barrel under each arm. Ironically, he died of lung cancer fifty years later.",/review/rw7008878/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2022,koltonbrett,7," A WW2 Hidden Gem
","The Forgotten Battle may not be the most memorable war movie ever made, but it is a solid Dutch war drama worth checking out. The aim of this film is to tell the true story of the lessor known Battle of the Scheldt. Visually, this movie is quite impressive. The cinematography beautifully displays an interesting landscape for us. The battle sequences are especially impressive and realistic. They are violent, graphic
and expertly shot. It is very much like Saving Private Ryan in that aspect. But there is a lot more going on in this movie than just battle action.",/review/rw7008878/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2021,Turfseer,9," Gripping Dutch chronicle of German-occupied Netherlands and little known World War II battle
","Caught this on Netflix and glad I did. It's an unusual World War II story set in Zeeland, the westernmost and least populous province in the Netherlands. The time is September 1944 just after the Allied D-Day invasion in June of that year. Large parts of the area are below sea level and the flooding of the main town plays a big part in the narrative.",/review/rw7008878/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2021,valleyjohn,8," A cracking war movie
","You would think by now that there wasn't any more stories to be told about the Second World War as it has been extensively covered in film over the last 70 years but no , they keep being made and if The Forgotten Battle is anything to go by , thank god for that .",/review/rw7008878/?ref_=tt_urv

28 November 2021,paul-allaer,8," Intense WWII drama from the Netherlands
","As ""The Forgotten Battle"" (2020 release from the Netherlands; 124 min; original title ""De Slag Om de Schelde"" a/k/a ""The Battle For the Scheld"") opens, we are reminded that the movie is ""inspired by true events"". Having successfully invaded Normandy in June, 1944, the Allies are now taking territory back from the Nazis and in need of a port that can serve as a major distribution hub and supply center. The choice is obvious: Antwerp, Belgium. The problem is that the river Scheld, the passage way to the North Sea, is still controlled by the Nazis. We then go to ""Vlissingen 6 September 1944"" and we are introduced to Dirk, a 17 yr. Old boy who is part of the Dutch resistance to the Nazis. When he throws a rock at the passing truck, he causes a deadly accident that kills several German soldiers, and he flees... At this point we are less than 10 min into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw7008878/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2021,florisvandriel,9," There is nothing romantic about war
","I enjoyed this movie very much, although enjoying isn't the right term. It shows the senselessness of war for most of those involved. Praise to the young actors, who did an exceptional job considering the script didn't give their roles a lot of depth. I particularly liked Gijs Blom who plays the part of a Dutch boy in the German service. The German commander was too stereotypically evil for my taste, but other than that this film is certainly in my top three of Dutch war movies. Go see it on the big screen, support your local cinema!",/review/rw7008878/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2021,vangamer,6," Canadian Army in film that's strangley flat
",The Forgotten Battle is a slow burn of a movie that gets some of the historic and military hardware things right but somehow doesn't satisfy as either a personal or historic story.,/review/rw7008878/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2021,Nostrama,10," true to character
","Just watch this, and im frankly quite relived to see that instead of the usual drivel out of hollywood that paints germans as evil monsters and allies as comic book superheroes, this movie shows the real side of the war that soldiers on both sides were just soldiers for good or for bad, and part of the allied success in the war came from germans being very human and losing faith as the war ground on.",/review/rw7008878/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2021,joelmulder96,5," Reviewing this is difficult
","For me, a Dutchie, this is a very difficult film to review. I am trying to figure out whether to see this as a war film or as a Dutch film. As a war film, this film does not stand out amongst others. Sure, it tells a relatively unknown story and it keeps its premise small and contained. However, it didn't invite me in. I don't know whether it's the characters or just the actors that played them, I just didn't have a solid point of reference. Of course, this could have been a purposeful decision, showing the audience that in those times, people (soldiers especially), were rather expendable. Not having one ""hero"" who everyone knows is going to survive is part of many a war film. If that is the case, I should definitely watch more war films to wrap my mind around which different choices each director makes in this genre. As a Dutch film, this is genuinely good. And that is saying something. As most fellow Dutchies will agree, Dutch films are just cinematic turd. Not bad or unprofessional or anything, just aggressively mediocre, forgettable, and predictable. Plus, the dialogue is always the verbal equivalent of wet socks. So, compared to those, this movie is pretty solid. Everyone speaks in their own native tongue, the production value is grand, and on a technical level, it is of convincing quality. I think that sums up what I think of the film. I would not say I had a bad time watching it, because I loved experiencing this in theatres. I just had a difficult time reviewing it.",/review/rw7008878/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2021,Noviomagum,9," So we won't forget this battle
","This is good. Well done actors, writers, cameramen, director and crew. Special credit for the choice of filming locations. Incredible, a big plus in this movie. I read somewhere the characters lack development. I don't agree, just pay attention to Marinus played by Gijs Blom (outstanding performance). It's not a movie with a lot of dialogue. Not necessary, the story and history speak for itself. The English title says it all, it's indeed a forgotten battle...",/review/rw7008878/?ref_=tt_urv

","From minute 1 till minute 124 this movie keeps you focussed. You can feel the battle, the pain and the suffer. Absolutely not over romanced. The effects were spectacular.
