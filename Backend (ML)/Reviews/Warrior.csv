8 October 2022,Chartreuse1,9," Spellbinding, creepy, and Jake Lacy is outstanding as the villain!
","Based on actual events, this Peacock original is excellent retelling the harrowing story of Jan Broberg, and her 2 childhood abductions by Robert Berchtold. The casting was very well done with Hendrix Yancey as Jan Broberg at 12 yrs old, Anna Paquin as Gail Broberg and Colin Hanks as Bob Broberg, Jan's parents, Lio Tipton as Gail Berchtold and Jake Lacy as Robert 'B' Berchtold. Honestly, it's only been 4 episodes but I am really enjoying how well it has played out so far, not shying away from the uglier parts of the story. Mckenna Grace's episodes have not even aired yet so I don't how other posters on here can critique her acting. Jake Lacy should be nominated for an Emmy portraying the seductive and manipulating 'B'. He has delivered a strong, believable, and cringeworthy performance. Unfortunately, pedophilia has always been timelessly present in our society and isn't going anywhere. Thanks to Jan Broberg and her family for allowing her account to be told and courageously shared from so many decades ago.",/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,katefrichardson,8," Outstanding!
","I would highly recommend watching ""Abducted in Plain Sight"" on Netflix as a prequel to watching this. You will get a WAY better grasp of everything that happens with this story from start to finish. The fact that Jan Broberg herself introduced this show in the beginning tells me Peacock is asking for permission before telling any true life stories on screen too... unlike Hulu LOL. BRAVO to everyone involved in this production. So far... I love Anna Paquin, Colin Hanks, Lio Tipton is outstanding and Jake Lacy as ""B"" is just as terrifying as I remember. I'm looking forward to McKenna Grace's performance. I know this happened in the 70's, but even today... this is a truly crazy story that I believe everyone needs to know about... to know what to look out for, and how to avoid it.",/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv

","Unbelievable though it may be, even at my age, I was unfamiliar with this story.",/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,HumbleMensa,9," Gross but wow
","This story is really freaky and it makes me cross, which means the movie did its job causing an emotional reaction. The brainwashing and psychology involved is portrayed well, and is sickening, although not surprising given the storyline. So wrong and so icky, and that vanilla generation with secrets behind closed doors --it's obvious manipulation based upon control and lies that calm the masses to allow the unbelievable to happen. The actors are fabulous. The writing and directing are both spot on. Well done, well done and I think everyone should watch this...and let's hope as a society this layer of clouded belief subsides. I hope the victim(s) don't suffer repercussions for some of the truth revealed and I applaud the main victim for even allowing the story to be told. Hanks, Lacy, Yancey, Grace, Paquin, and Tipton alll give stellar performances.",/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,petercarlsson-92297,10," At last a great series
","This is a great series made by grown ups for a mature audience. The story telling takes have just the right tempo. Fantastic acting from everyone involved. Beautiful cinematography. The serious subject are handled in a way that makes you understand the times, and how little people knew about pedophilia in the 70s.",/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,Always_green86,8," Woww!!!
",Aside from the fact this is a True story if this was fiction it would Still be shocking ..very in depth in gives you a interesting perspective on a story most of us haven't known I appreciate how well this was out together and easy to follow.. at times during this it was hard to believe some of these events occurred.,/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,meezerfan123,10," Absolutely enraging but compelling story of a textbook narcissist
","I agree with other reviews that recommend watching ""Abducted in Plain Sight,"" the documentary, on Netflix so that you understand the story going in since this adaptation does jump around in time quite a bit. That said, it is an incredibly compelling dramatization of a malignant narcissist and pedophile and what he did to a family whose strong religious beliefs led them to expect the best from people and at the same time, left them extremely vulnerable to manipulation. There isn't a weak link in this cast. Anna Paquin is excellent as a good mother who gets no validation from her strict disciplinarian husband, Colin Hanks. Hanks is spot on as the kind of rule-follower who believes that's all he has to do to get through life. Jake Lacy is the creep, but handsome and charming enough that you understand why he got his own way in situations where it is mind-blowing that he did. Lio Tipton plays his wife, meek with a side of just-as-psycho, and quickly makes us forget we first met her as a model. Finally, all I can say about Hendrix Yancy is this kid deserves an Emmy nomination - her portrayal of an abuse victim who still loves her accuser is so accurate that it is chilling. It is hard to watch because you know someone should be protecting this vulnerable child, but no one is! The show is making me want to yell at the TV which I'm sure is what they were going for. I hate that this is a true story, but the dramatization makes for A+ television.",/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv

13 November 2022,destiny_west,9," If the documentary Abducted in Plain Sight blew your mind...

14 October 2022,Sayitasitis212,10," A perfect series with disgraceful characters (Not just the obvious one)
","I watched the documentary on this when it came out back in 2017 which as some other reviewers have stated it's a worth while watch prior to watching this to get you up to speed, Abducted in plain sight is an unfortunately accurate documentary on this series that in itself is incredibly accurate and perfectly executed on all aspects!",/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2022,rvgillam-44732,7," Just WOW!!
","Be prepared to have your blood pressure raised. I'm only on the 2nd episode and I find myself baffled at how clueless the parents are!! I actually developed a disdain towards them; even moreso than the antagonist. I yelled at the television a few times. Omg!! This is based on a true story. I mean... they claimed they loved God, but these people were so out of touch with reality they were basically aiding and abbeding the abduction of their daughter. They're so dumb that it's almost comical. To be honest, it is comical but it's not supposed to be. I laughed at the parents at the sheer audacity, and also at the lengths that the villain went through making up that fantastical story and implementing everything that went along with it. I will say he is thorough. He's showing out in that role.",/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2022,julieshotmail,6," Anna Paquin bad, McKenna Grace good
","The start of ""A Friend of the Family"" bewilders you with a premise that is stranger than fiction. If you are not previously familiar with the story, you would be confused with amazement that this happened in real life. However, once the shock wears off, the pacing gets a bit dull, and Anna Paquin hamming it up for the camera becomes too much. She is an Oscar winner; I do not know why she now has to contort her facial parts into weird angles. Nevertheless, there is decent acting in this series, particularly from Jake Lacey, Colin Hanks, and Hendrix Yancey as young Jan. Most of all, it is McKenna Grace that keeps me hooked waiting for her appearance starting in episode 5. She is so talented with a bright future, several accolades, and lead roles coming her way. As good as McKenna is though, she cannot save the show from the odd cadence and disjointed threads. Six episodes instead of nine would have been ideal. There is a nice sprinkle of authenticity throughout, thanks to the real survivor Jan Broberg who openly sanctions this show and even has a small acting part in it.",/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,lousha-1,6," Not quite there
","It's an ok presentation of an unbelievable story. What I keep feeling though after seeing a documentary about the case is that this just doesn't add anything. It's telling the exact same information a 1 and a half hour documentary already told, only stretched into several episodes. No deep emotions, nothing really personal is coming through, it's like listening to someone in a monotonous voice read out an article. A long one. An interesting one for sure, but not enacted in any meaningful way. The case itself will evoke lots of emotions from a viewer, but that's strictly the story, not the series itself.",/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2022,cparousis-30615,10," This show is the epitome of lunacy
","The entire idea that these events actually happened is lunacy!!! I'm three shows into this and this ride has been, WOW! You know right off the bat that Mr. B is a creep and disturbed. Indicates how trusting folks were back in the 70's. The intro by the actual Jan was great as well. I'm glad it was made into a series because a movie would nit have done this justice. You feel for the parents throughout the series and sorry for Jan because of falling for Mr. B's depravity. Great acting. Nice pacing. A truly captivating story that peels back the layers of this dirtbag and his evil ways. Highly recommended! A++",/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2022,jkvsampson,7," I didn't want to like this
","I hadn't planned on watching as the story is so creepy, however I caved and I'm glad I did. The acting is great especially from the children given the subject. I am impressed by how they are putting you in the parents position and showing you how convincing someone can be. The parents of Jan (the girl who is kidnapped) are very naive and easily trusting of their church friends. When I watched the documentary on Netflix I thought ""how could this happen!?"" Watching this show I find myself thinking ""these parents are so dumb!"" Yes they are naive but seriously no grown man needs to be hanging out with a little girl!",/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,mandyethomas,4," Unbelievably naive parents, bad acting
","Paquin's acting is hard to watch--her facial expressions are very forced. Hanks' and Lacy's acting is also not their best. But mainly it's the naiveté of the parents that makes it hard to believe. Idc what decade it was or what their religious affiliation was, no adult is this naive/dumb. They mindlessly get rid of evidence, believe that a grown man lying w/ a 12 yo is therapy, the mom gets over him kidnapping their daughter and F's him *after* the kidnapping and after knowing about her hubby's handy. No way! I bet the parents used these lies to hide a worse truth, only thing that makes sense.",/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,mrjeffmoore,7," Should Have Gone All The Way
","While some people are saying this is too disturbing to watch, this series actually tames down the actual abduction and abuse. In the documentary, we learn that the parents allowed him to sleep in her bed unsupervised for MONTHS as part of his ""therapy"" after admitting he liked young girls. Seriously? You are aware that this man has unnatural desires and you allow him to sleep next to your daughter? He also listened to tapes while lying next to her that envisioned her as some magical wife in his life. They also admit in the documentary that they had sex several times during that time. So while this series is almost unbelievable, if you want to see how TRULY disturbing it was and how UNBELIEVABLY naive the parents were, watch ""Abducted in Plain Sight"" instead.",/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2022,trudjoh,4," Made it through episode 4 (almost)
",I have to admit to binge watching this show. To be honest I am surprised by the 7.1 rating. I started watching it when I saw the cast. Thought to myself I could not beat a show with Colin Hanks and Anna Paquin. Their work has always been good.,/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv

","Where does one even start with the Broberg story? How about the fact that Bob Berchtold, a close friend of the Brobergs, didn't just kidnap Jan and take her to Mexico-he kidnapped her again two years later? How about his technique to brainwash Jan, convincing her that aliens had taken both of them and would destroy her loved ones if she didn't consent? And just wait until you see how close Bob got to both Mary Ann (Anna Paquin) and Bob in the years before the kidnapping, manipulating their weaknesses in a way that made them easier to control.",/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2022,angeladavis49,8," Sad, disturbing and infuriation but a good watc
",This was good but I was edgy watching it the whole time. It made me agitated how stupid everyone was in this. I wanted to grab her parents by the throat and shake them especially the mother and Jan. I can't understand how they could be so dumb. I think Jan believing the alien thing made her seem mentally slow or something. She was old enough to know better. The actor playing the predator was so good I actually hated him. I wanted the mother to shoot him when she had the chance. He was obviously crazy. How this girl can be normal now after all she went through is beyond me. I saw the documentary on Netflix or I would have thought this was made up. It's so awful and wild! Her parents were ridiculously naive but they did love her so I felt sorry for them. The last episode dragged a lot though. You may be pulling your hair out the whole time in frustration but it's well done and interesting.,/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,rickcamacho-78343,8," Great Male Leads! Jake Lacey and Colin Hanks steal the Show!!!!
","A Friend of the Family is based on a true story, and while this adaptation takes many liberties with it's story telling, what makes it a must watch is the must see performances from Jake Lacey and Colin Hanks. Lacey who plays the bad guy gives such a charismatic, unsettling and creepy performance that it keeps you glued to the screen from start to finish. While I agree that the scenes without Lacey drag a bit, the chemistry between him and Colin Hanks is very electric. Unfortunately the weakest part of the show are it's female leads. I'm a big Anna Paquin fan, I mean she has and Oscar, but here she waste her talents. Mckenna Grace also gives a terrible performance.",/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv

20 October 2022,davidsonjen,10," Not sure if I even believe this story is actually real.
","I just got done watching episode 6 and so far, she was actually only kidnapped once, the other times she ran away so, not sure why she says she was kidnapped several times. I know it was in the 70s but I just really don't buy that a kid her age really believed she was half alien n had to save a planet by having a baby with a pedophile. It just seems there has to be more to what happened and it also seems like, in the way she tells her story, not one person actually takes responsibility for their own part in the whole thing, including Jan. I know he groomed her n all but, some of it really was still her own actions. I have never in my entire life met a 14 year old girl who would buy stories that she's half alien, just throwing that out there. Makes me wonder how much of her story really happened the way she says it did.",/review/rw8624772/?ref_=tt_urv
