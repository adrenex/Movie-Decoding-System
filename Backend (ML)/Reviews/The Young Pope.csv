11 July 2017,Bryan-,10," My type of humor.
","This was a pleasant surprise. Before watching this I had never heard of it. There are a ton of LOL moments. The humor is juvenile, just how I like it. If you didn't find this funny you need to loosen up. I only wish it was longer. It was nice seeing Kit in a comedy. When the camera panned down in the underwear scene...",/review/rw3281595/?ref_=tt_urv

15 July 2015,wjcochrane,8," Worth the Watch
","Not at all what I expected when I saw the trailer. They pushed the envelope as far as possible when making this movie and it paid off. How unexpected some of the things are in this movie is what makes it so funny. Andy Samberg and Kit Harrington play their roles perfectly Definitely do not watch this movie with any children or your parents depending on your situation. The unexpected cameos in this movie are incredible. They got the most random people possible to be in this movie. Do not go into this movie with high hopes, accept it as it is. You will not be disappointed. So many things about this movie are incredible. 7 Days in Hell is 100% worth the watch.",/review/rw3281595/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2015,whitneycraig,8," Super Funny AND Super Dumb
","As long as you understand that it is intentionally dumb, then you will laugh through the whole thing. It's not trying to be like Blades of Glory or any other sports parody like that, it's just a dumb comedy that really is hilarious.",/review/rw3281595/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2015,calum55,9," Very funny!
","So as a tennis fan myself I wasn't sure what to expect from a documentary style parody. With some good actors and tennis stars I was hoping for it to be worth my time. Andy Samberg was especially really funny, as were all the actors. The whole way through I was laughing, there are some weird moments which shouldn't put you of as this is a very different but hilarious 40 minutes that will be worth your time. If your looking for a comedy which is different and unique then this will be for you as this is not serious at all. It is very hard to make a parody of something really funny as I have watched a few in the past and they have been very poor but this one was very funny. I recommend to everyone, even people who don't enjoy sport will enjoy it.",/review/rw3281595/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2015,gianlucamarzano16,7," A long Saturday night live sketch
","7 days in hell is a fictional documentary about the longest tennis match in history. It is directed by Jake Szymanski and stars Kit Harington and Andy Samberg. First off, seeing the trailer I could this could be very funny or just very stupid. I'm glad to said that it turned out to be very funny. The acting is great, Kit Harington who is on Game Of Thrones, I didn't know if he could be funny and he played his part perfect. Andy Samberg was also great. He always plays a funny part and he's does a great job most of the time. Overall 7 days in hell was a funny fake documentary about tennis with great acting and has lots of great cameos. Defiantly worth checking out.",/review/rw3281595/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2016,cherold,7," Silly but lots of fun, with a great performance by Michael Sheen
","7 Days in Hell is a very silly tennis mockumentary. It's utterly ridiculous from beginning to end, but it's smart enough to make the stupidity work. It seems like something that was probably a lot of fun to make, since its creators were free to ignore all bounds of taste and reason.",/review/rw3281595/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2015,Aktham_Tashtush,8," It is nice watching some new style of comedy with such cool cast.
","The Idea of the movie is so fresh and genuine the plot is extended and unpredictable .. and the script is funny , In some parts it looked a bit loose with only a couple of shaggy scenes like having sex on the court or in the Swedish prison but it's an HBO thing so we shall be used to that by now but As a whole it suits a TV movie form on cable and i do think they mad it perfectly on the time matter speaking. back to the writer Murray Miller he is not that guy with much of achievements apart from 3 Primetime Emmy nominations on Girls and American Dad :D yet i do believe he made a home run by this movie. Honestly, The ending was Fair but not satisfying it was like lets make a balanced final scene between two stars ""Andy Samberg and Kit Harington"".",/review/rw3281595/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2015,peefyn,7," Comedians having fun
","I must assume that this started as an idea for a skit, but they kept adding on jokes until they realized that they couldn't go any further. At a bit over 40 minutes, this skit is just about as long as it could be. And they cram those 40 minutes full of gags. And all the people involved seems like they are having a great time.",/review/rw3281595/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2015,nanciwaco,10," if you follow tennis, this is the funniest spoof ever!!!
","as a tennis fan for about 40 years, I know the ins and outs from watching grand slam tournaments. if you know your tennis, then you are familiar with the Wimbledon no-tiebreaker in the fifth set. think back to john isner two day fifth set. if you are not a fan of tennis, I can see why you wouldn't like it. to the reviewer who said it looked like they filmed it in 2-3 days -- you are correct. it was made in 3 days. I honestly think every match I watch from here on out, I will enjoy a good chuckle. this review may sound total helpless, but I wouldn't dare to give anything away. I don't think the world would come to an end if you took 50 minutes out of your life to watch it.",/review/rw3281595/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2015,avenuesf,2," Really bad
","As much as I've always liked Andy Samberg, I was left wondering just why he chose this as a project. Forty minutes go by with very little continuity and (it appeared) no script. The whole thing seemed to be rushed and off the cuff and looked as though they completed it in about two-three days, and I don't think I laughed once. Even the co-stars (Howie Mandel, Mary Steenbergen, June Squibb, etc.) seemed wasted and their characterizations were tired and not particularly original. I think HBO has put out some incredible programming in the last few years but am wondering why they backed this, as it seems completely mediocre with no real point. Let's hope Samberg finds better projects in the future, he's way too good to be putting out stuff like this.",/review/rw3281595/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2016,Reno-Rangan,9," It wasn't even a match. It was something else.
","This is a 45 minute mockumentary made for the television that was aired on HBO last year. Directed by a some television director, who recently made his feature film comedy, 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates'. It is an American film, but the story takes place in England.",/review/rw3281595/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2018,SnoopyStyle,7," great fun
",It's a fake documentary of a 2001 Wimbledon tennis match between Aaron Williams (Andy Samberg) and Charles Poole (Kit Harington) which lasted 7 days. Aaron grew up in a reverse Blind Side situation with the Serena Williams' family. Charles is one of dimmest people around with mommy issues.,/review/rw3281595/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2015,Horst_In_Translation,8," Hilarious mockumentary
","John Isner and Nicolas Mahut were nothing against these guys. If you are as interested in tennis as I am, you will certainly understand this reference. And you will hopefully also enjoy these 42 minutes as much as I did. This comedy short film was really well done. Interviews with former tennis players like McEnroe and Chris Evert added a nice seemingly serious touch, but don't be mistaken. It is 100% comedy. David Copperfield's addition seemed a bit random at first, but it's fine too I guess. The scene where he appeared after one of his tricks (gone wrong) on the Centre Court was funny. I also liked everything with June Squibb, especially the elevator scene and the streakers on the court were fun too. Back to June Squibb, this is a nice watch for lovers of the film ""Nebraska"" as Will Forte appeared in here too. The runtime was perfect too. There were hardly no scene that felt unnecessary, so it was good to keep the film this short before it could possible drag. And of course, all the tennis scenes were pure comedy gold, especially the one scene called the greatest point ever played. This is a must-see for every tennis fan. Plus the cast isn't that bad either with Hamm, Dunham and Sheen apart from the ones I already mentioned. I laughed from start to finish in here and I was close to giving this one a perfect score. Finally, a mention to Murray Miller who wrote the script for this one. It would be nice to see him get Emmy recognition for this, but I guess not. Anyway, highly recommended. Go check it out.",/review/rw3281595/?ref_=tt_urv

","7 days in Hell is a sports mockumentary from HBO about a fictional account of the world's longest tennis match, which took place in the summer of 2001 and lasted for seven days. The match was between Aaron Williams (Andy Samberg) the Andre Agassi lookalike with a John McEnroe temperament who is also the adopted brother of Venus & Serena Williams and Charles Poole (Kit Harington) the pride of Britain who is as dumb as he looks.",/review/rw3281595/?ref_=tt_urv

8 August 2015,Sergeant_Tibbs,7," Don't drink anything. You'll spit it right out.
","When I think tennis and funny, I always think of that scene in The Royal Tenenbaums where Luke Wilson's Richie gives up for good. Maybe writer of 7 Days In Hell Murray Miller enjoyed that scene too and though it would be great to have a mini-mockumentary about what happened next. Just long enough to be considered a movie, 7 Days In Hell is a densely packed film, enough material and running gags to make a feature if they wanted to. But that might spoil its delights. If you wanted 80 or 90 minutes, you'd have to add too many detracting subplots to develop its characters. Instead, we get them developed at a distance, and instead of subplots, we get outlandish tangents, such as exploring the life of an innovative courtroom artist. ",/review/rw3281595/?ref_=tt_urv

","""7 Days in Hell"" (2015 release; 43 min.) is a ""mockumentary"" about the epic first round tennis match at Wimbledon 2001 between American 'bad boy of tennis' Aaron Williams and British 'poster boy of tennis' Charles Poole. As the movie opens, they are in day 7 of that tennis match, with literally everyone, including the players, begging for an end. We then go back in time, and get to know both players, including the fact that Aaron was adopted at a young age by Richard Williams (father of Venus and Serena)...",/review/rw3281595/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2015,ari-996-953861,1," Worst thing I've ever seen!!
","Wow! HBO has put out some fantastic programming over the years. From watching the trailer, this had the potential to be supremely funny. It was honestly the worst thing I've every watched. 4 funny moments adding up to about 2 minutes sewn together over pure garbage. I truly hope the person who wrote this never works again. Anyone who enjoyed watching this is likely to be living in a trailer, on drugs, an alcoholic, not college educated, or likely any combination of the above. The only reason I'm taking the time to post this is to perhaps save you all from getting really angry. ;) While I can't really remember the funny lines that clearly since there were so few, one that was remotely funny was the doing lines of cocaine on the tennis court lines. My 7 year old nephew could write a far more entertaining/funny version of this concept. This is a supremely poor man's Blades of Glory. Supremely poor.",/review/rw3281595/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2019,patriciogl10,7," I stumbled upon great comedy!
","Kit Harington and Andy Samberg, a rather unlikely pairing; nevertheless exciting in my view. I was expecting over-the-top comedy and this effort sure delivered. Mockumentaries are always great, when done right, and this was the case for 7 Days in Hell. The fact the I really like tennis made it even more appealing to me. The cast was brilliantly hilarious, from Kit and Andy and the celebrities who appeared as themselves. I'm really glad I came across this, it showed me an interesting side to Kit, who's probably the only one not involved in the comedic part of showbiz.",/review/rw3281595/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2015,fx_man,4," Funny in places but mostly rushed and shockingly tasteless in the end
","I rarely write reviews, but because I love tennis I couldn't remain silent about 7 Days in Hell (which might as well refer to the viewer's experience watching it). So, because I love tennis I was looking forward to what had been advertised as a long-deserved comedy tribute to this phenomenal sport. Kudos to HBO for at least making this happen, then. Sadly, the laudatory comments have to end there. As a I began watching, my exhilaration soon gave way to consternation, which gave way to disappointment, which gave way to mild disgust, which gave way to utter disbelief as the show progressed. Foregoing any real effort at mining comedy from what makes tennis a unique sport in how it affects those intimately involved in it, the film veers into the direction of a no-holds-barred adolescent gross-out fest that I am not sure even a target audience of 14-year old males could continue to enjoy beyond the few initial reaches of explicit excess.",/review/rw3281595/?ref_=tt_urv
