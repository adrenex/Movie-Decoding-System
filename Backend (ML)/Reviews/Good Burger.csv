3 October 2010,hitchcockthelegend,8," We can't have our law officers beatin' people half to death for no reason.
","Appaloosa is based on the 2005 novel of the same name written by Robert B. Parker. It's directed by Ed Harris, who also co-writes the story with Robert Knott. Harris also stars alongside Viggo Mortensen, Renée Zellweger, Jeremy Irons & Lance Henriksen. Music is by Jeff Beal and Dean Semler provides cinematography on location in Albuquerque, Austin and Santa Fe.",/review/rw1975937/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2008,artzau,8," Superb!
","One reviewer remarked how ""Ed Harris understands (the) Western (genre)"" I couldn't agree more. This film is a delight. The writing is solid, the dialog sparked with humor, the heroes are more than caricatures and cardboard cut-outs, the villains are worthy anti-heroes and the back-up is wonderful. The performances of Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen and Jeremy Irons as the main protag-/antagonists are sterling. Harris is the lonely paladin, uncompromising in his ethic, drawn in by the warmth and softness of a needful woman, artfully and convincingly played by Renee Zellweger; Mortensen is the slightly jaded sidekick who both respects and doesn't completely understand his hero. A parallel villain is offered by Lance Henrikson, a kind of poor man's Clint Eastwood, giving an interesting twist to the story. Some comic relief is offered by veteran character actor, James Gammon and fine British actor Timothy Spall without reducing the tension in the story line or reverting to a burlesque. The mythic theme of the knight-errant works well in this presentation brought to light by the competent direction of Ed Harris. My only fear is that it being devoid of ballet-type ritual killings, CGI and only a mild spattering of violence, it will likely fly under the radar of much of today's theater goers, which is a shame. It's a fine film.",/review/rw1975937/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2009,ma-cortes,7," Intelligent and compelling tale about two friends hired by little townspeople to protect them
","There are always the men who live breathe violence and the women who hold their breath.

14 January 2011,Leofwine_draca,7," Stylish western with a great script
","Many in Hollywood believe the western is dead, but every couple of years or so along comes a new western to breathe life into the old standbys: OPEN RANGE, 3:10 TO YUMA, and of course TV's DEADWOOD. APPALOOSA is such a film that follows a typical storyline as a couple of lawmen battle an outlaw gang in a small town.",/review/rw1975937/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2008,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,9," An old school western that more than gets the job done. It's a tour de ""fource"" for Ed Harris
","Films are made for us to escape to a new reality, whether that reality be complete fantasy, present day, the future, or in this case, the good old West. What we have here is a great western that looks and feels like a classic in the making, an old school western with an old school touch of directing (and acting) from Ed Harris. Appaloosa is very accessible in a film genre that isn't so accessible. It's a straightforward film that, despite that, never becomes predictable and formulaic. Harris's wonderful job on all fronts make Appaloosa one of the most complete films of the year. It's got it all, great writing, killer acting, and a great atmosphere that allows the viewer to get trapped in this old western world.",/review/rw1975937/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2008,judywalker2,7," An OK western but a great character study
","Appaloosa as a western is okay, as a movie its okay, but as a character study it's great. Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen are two of the most underrated actors (not stars) in Hollywood. Viggo should have had two or three Oscars by now. His rendition of Everett Hitch made the whole movie more than worthwhile. He's a man of little words but great thought. He also an observant man, of things and people. He's loyal but with practicality. He knows what the two of them do and why they do it and he know enough about Virgil not to step on his toes. But he also knows when to say what he as to say and leave it at that. I'm never that impressed by Renee Zellweger but in this movie she sort of fit in. 7/10",/review/rw1975937/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2008,jon.h.ochiai,7," Compelling and Weird Western
","On the immediate surface ""Apaloosa"" occurs as an old school Western grounded in the battle of good against evil. For the most part first time director/ writer Ed Harris's ""Apaloosa"" is the traditional tale of gunslingers hired to protect the town against the malevolent rancher, who terrorizes the town of Apaloosa. This slithery and wily Rancher is Randall Bragg, well played by Academy Award Winner Jeremy Irons. Irons is amazing. In the opening Bragg (Irons) kills the town Marshall and his deputies in cold blood. So there is no question surrounding Bragg's character. Harris and Viggo Mortensen play Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch, who are lawmen for hire. The town of Apaloosa signs a contract with Virgil and Everett paying them to protect the town from Bragg. As part of the deal Apaloosa surrenders legal jurisdiction and autonomy to Cole and Hitch. This is pretty straight forward until femme fatale widow Allison French (Renee Zellwegger) arrives in town. Virgil takes a quick fancy to Allison, but her motives are vague and questionable at best. Will she threaten Virgil's partnership with Everett? ",/review/rw1975937/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2008,Buddy-51,5," Intelligent but draggy Western
","In ""Appaloosa,"" which is set in the New Mexican territory of 1882, Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen are a pair of frontier lawmen hired by the citizens of Appaloosa to wrest control of the town from a gang of ruffians (led by Jeremy Irons) after they shoot down the marshal and his deputies in cold blood. Renee Zellweger also shows up as a promiscuous widow who captures the eye and eventually the heart of the newly appointed sheriff (Harris).",/review/rw1975937/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2008,socrates99,9," Finally, a western by people who understand real conflict
","I suppose this film is as vulnerable to deep analysis as the next one, but, why bother? This is entertainment the way I like it, straight up without a lot of foolish over the top action. The real west must have been fraught with similar dilemmas as that confronting the town of Appaloosa: What to do with a lawless band of men determined to live as they please by preying on timid town dwellers? I doubt there were many men like Virgil Cole or his partner Everett Hitch in the real west having lived among their great, great grandchildren (I've no idea what the real genealogy is) for a time, but men have often tried to live like they do with the result that they lived undeservedly short lives. Still, guys like me can't get enough of their stories and Ed Harris apparently feels the same way. Only Clint Eastwood in my memory has attempted to tap into this same wellspring of folklore as in The Unforgiven. Though we all love Clint, I'd have to say Ed outdoes him here. He's got a wonderful sense of what a real gunfight might have been like. And though he's trimmed off the cries of pain and the gore, it still has the ring of truth.",/review/rw1975937/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2009,Nazi_Fighter_David,8," A fascinating Western about two lifelong friends
","There are two tough partners in justice Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) that have been riding together for more than one decade and they understand each other just fine So they're not initially supposed to talk about their easy, warm, intuitive solidarity We intuitively catch there's something between them, that special bond, that profound respect, and obviously that sense of esteem, of attention and sympathy and most of all each other's needs",/review/rw1975937/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2008,ronroc-1,9," Great Adaptation of Parker's novel
","I love all of Robert B. Parker's novels and I have a lot of respect for the craft of Ed Harris. This movie was a very faithful rendering of the book. Harris didn't get in the way of the storytelling rather he gave it a strong visualization. As the novel as written, the story is actually told through the eyes of Everett Hitch, played here by Viggo Mortenson. I love the way, even though he is somewhat of a side-kick, he was allowed to remain the viewpoint character. My only complaint was Renee as Allie. Reading the book I visualized a Faye Dunaway at 35. Diane Lane would have been more in line with the way the character was written in the novel. Renne struck me as a little too coquettish and obviously needy rather than manipulative and needy. It's a matter of taste but I would have preferred it. However, the rest of the casting was spot on and I hope Harris considers doing the sequel, ""Resolution.""",/review/rw1975937/?ref_=tt_urv

12 August 2011,kenjha,7," Low-Key Western
","In the old West, two men ride into a small town to establish some law and order. This is a leisurely paced Western and it's quite enjoyable for the most part, but sort of runs out of steam about two-thirds of the way through. It is mostly a character study, with much time spent on low-key exchanges between Harris and Mortensen as the two lawmen, with some of the scenes reminiscent of ""My Darling Clementine."" Not that it's anywhere close to being as good as that classic. Zellweger seems like a curious choice to play a woman who arrives in town and strikes up a romance with Harris. She just looks out of place in a Western. It's not a bad second effort for Harris behind the camera.",/review/rw1975937/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2008,Chrysanthepop,," Two Smoking Barrels And A Promiscuous Dame
","Of recent times, the only Western movie that I liked was Kevin Costner's 'Open Range'. Now there's another one, 'Appaloosa' which is produced, written, directed and performed in by Ed Harris. The film pretty much has the ingredients of the 60s and 70s Western hits. It starts off a little slow but gradually picks up. 'Appaloosa' is more a comedy than an action but action movie lovers need not worry because there is plenty of that too, all 60's Western style. The dialogue is great and some of them are laugh out loud. The desert and mountainous visuals are stunning to look at. The two law-enforcement heroes, are brilliantly played by Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen. Harris is totally hilarious yet we sympathize for him when he falls hopelessly in love with the promiscuous never-to-be-faithful Ali. Mortensen is more restrained, reminding one of Clint Eastwood at times, but equally effective. I initially thought Renee Zellweger was cast as the typical love interest but man was I wrong. Here she is cast against type and the actress is simply great as she deceptively uses those innocent sweet girl looks to mask her frivolity and promiscuity. Likewise, Jeremy Irons is an excellent villain with a touch of comedy. Lovers of Western cinema wold enjoy this. This is most of all Harris's achievement as he scores high on all counts. Hope he makes more movies.",/review/rw1975937/?ref_=tt_urv

","The tough friends and partners Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) arrive in the town of Appaloosa and they are hired as marshal and deputy by the local politicians with absolute power to rule the city. In their first assignment, they face the gang of the powerful rancher Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons), who had killed Marshall Jack Bell (Bobby Jauregui) and his two deputies, and they kill three gunmen. When the refined piano player Allison French (Renée Zellweger) arrives in Appaloosa, she stays close to the needy Virgil and they decide to live together. Meanwhile one employee of Bragg offers to testify against his boss and Virgil and Everett bring him to court, where he is sentenced to death by hanging. While transporting Bragg in the train to be executed, two gunmen abduct Allie to force Virgil to release the criminal.

5 August 2009,rmax304823,6," Engaging Old-Fashioned Western.
","It's old fashioned because there's never any real doubt about who's good and who's bad in this nicely filmed and subtly comedic Western. Local big shot Jeremy Irons is bad. He shot a deputy sheriff in Apaloosa. The honest sheriff, Ed Harris, and his remaining deputy, Vigo Mortenson, capture Irons, see him convicted and sentenced to hang, but then are forced to part with their prisoner in exchange for the life of Harris's girl friend, Renee Zellweger. A climactic shoot out resolves most of the issues.",/review/rw1975937/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2009,MLDinTN,6," character driven western
","This is not your typical western. The characters are more developed and do a lot of talking versus gun slinging. But there are some gun fights along the way. Town officials of Appaloosa hire two gunmen, Cole and Hitch, to be the new sheriff in town. They want them to get rid of Randall Bragg, an outlaw that killed the previous sheriff. Widow, Allison French, shows up and you think there is going to be a love triangle, but there really wasn't much of one. She takes a liking to Cole, but also gives Hitch mixed singles. The two are able to arrest Bragg for murder and the latter part of the film is Bragg escaping and Cole finding him and trying to bring him in. In the end Bragg seems reformed. The side plot involving Allison is she seems to go after any man with power. So, before leaving town, Hitch does Cole one last favor since Cole says he won't leave Allison even if she fools around.",/review/rw1975937/?ref_=tt_urv
