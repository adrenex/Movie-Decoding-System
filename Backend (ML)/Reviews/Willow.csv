24 November 2022,MrDHWong,7," Continues the character's story in the same light-hearted manner as the previous film
","""Enola Holmes 2"" is the sequel to the 2020 film ""Enola Holmes"" based on the book series ""The Enola Holmes Mysteries"" by Nancy Springer. Once again starring Millie Bobby Brown in the title role, it continues the character's story in the same light-hearted manner as the previous film.",/review/rw8657699/?ref_=tt_urv

4 November 2022,neil-douglas2010,8," Fun fun fun
","This is just what we need, a truly fun and enjoyable sequel to the 2020 original. Again starring Millie Bobby Brown and Henry Cavill as brother and sister detectives. Since the original movie Enola has started her own detective agency but to no avail. Luckily a case arrives, something fishy is happening at a match making factory where a female work force are getting ill and dying. Enola is helped of course by her brother, but also her mother played by an excellent Helena Bonham Carter, and the love interest Lord Tewkesbury. The film is a joy with plenty of twists, loads of villains and a potential look at more films in the future, here's hoping. PS, love the talking to the camera Millie.",/review/rw8657699/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2022,Drawmort,5," Netflix did it again...
","This sequel has more appeal in the stories that occur in the background, while its protagonist brags under the main spotlight about a superficial and repeated fable. Both the plots of Sherlock Holmes, like that of his mother, concern a more realistic and intriguing tone, with a real threat, above the pretensions of an insufferable teenager. Yes. My main problem with this film is its protagonist. Her acting is highly unconvincing. Her interactions with the audience as she breaks the fourth wall is one of the worst attempts at appearing likeable and charismatic I've seen this year.",/review/rw8657699/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2022,pranayjalvi,5," Just ordinary, nothing extra
","Enola Holmes 2 is too concerned with chases, romance and flattering the target audience to even consider challenging anyone's puzzle-solving abilities. Like the first film, ""Enola Holmes 2"" hinges on how quickly we take to Enola's spirited heroine. She's still prone to both aces decision-making and a barrage of fourth wall-breaking jokes and jabs.",/review/rw8657699/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2022,opticuscro,4," Not again! W..e
","Sometimes you start watching a movie and you have a lot of expectations for the movie, more then movie worth, it's the same here. I watched the first part of and it can be said that I was indifferent about that film, but this time I have to express my honest opinion. By character and acting, the film seems to be intended for younger ages, that is, children, but considering the extremely violent scenes, it is definitely not for children, so thats strange. The story is mysterious, as befits a film with this character, some funny scenes, but that's about it. The acting is at a professional level and it's a pleasure to watch. What visibly degrades or completely destroys this film in its entirety is the highly visible woke content that was inserted just to be there, and the incredible wokened ending. Without that unnecessary content, the film would be immeasurably more watchable and fun.",/review/rw8657699/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,cliftonofun,6," Second verse, same as the first
","Second verse, same as the first. Sometimes the knowing glances at the camera are perfectly timed, and sometimes they are over the top. Sometimes the mystery's intriguing, and sometimes it is laughable. Sometimes the interplay crackles, and sometimes it feels cartoonish. This series is filled with all the highs and all the lows. There's no doubt that Brown and Cavill kill it, but everything else struggles to keep up. If you have a middle schooler, it is a great intro to classic mysteries...but if you want a truly classic mystery, the BBC's Sherlock is a much better option. (Also, if we're ranking the Holmes adaptations, it is far from the bottom. And far from the top, as well.) As for the endings? Yikes.",/review/rw8657699/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2022,robfollower,8," I thoroughly enjoyed this caper
","While the first film was all about finding herself, ""Enola Holmes 2"" is a straight detective story, with Enola following in the footsteps of her famous older brother yet carving her own path and honing her young super-sleuthing skills. She's still smart, perceptive, and fiercely independent. And she still routinely breaks the fourth wall to offer us some hilarious commentary or sometimes just to get things off her chest. This is where Brown's performance really shines. Her ability to shuffle between comedy and drama is impressive. And she's able to retain Enola's playfulness from the first film while also showing some meaningful growth. Brown fully embodies her character. She carries the movie with her effervescent style, and the other actors follow suit.",/review/rw8657699/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2022,chris_rowe-881-168820,5," 2 years later
","Not talking about the gap in the films, just how long the second felt. Dear me it genuinely seemed like it was never going to end, whilst not a bad film, it also kills alot of the good qualities the first one had. Ignoring the obvious and obnoxious woke elements of casting and scenarios overall the film is just a bit convoluted.",/review/rw8657699/?ref_=tt_urv

","Following the events on the first film, Enola Holmes has set up her own detective agency. Unfortunately it is not a success. Then, just as she is about to give up, a young girl enters and asks Enola to find her sister. They both worked at as match girls... workers in the match factories. Meanwhile famous brother Sherlock has come up against a brick wall in a case involving financial corruption at the highest levels. Enola's investigation will lead her into danger and even she her arrested for murder!",/review/rw8657699/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,danieljfarthing,8," A ripping & entertaining family-friendly adventure befitting of the original
","As befits 2020's ""Enola Holmes"", ""Enola Holmes 2"" is a ripping family-friendly adventure in which Millie Bobby Brown's again superb as the titular little sis of Sherlock Holmes (Henry Cavill) now trying to be a Victorian London detective herself. When her first case (a missing girl) overlaps Cavill's (blackmail in govt) mean cop David Thewlis (excellent) tries to quash them... but they're aided by the likes of rebel mum Helena Bonham-Carter & Brown's potential bf Lord Louis Partridge. Terrifically written with twists, humour & character by Jack Thorne, and directed with swashbuckling pace & wit by Harry Bradbeer it is STONKING stuff & blummin' entertaining.",/review/rw8657699/?ref_=tt_urv

","I had a great time watching this movie, much like the first. I think it was just as sharp, witty, clever, fun, sweet, and entertaining. Millie once again does an impeccable job as Enola. Henry also plays the role of Sherlock wonderfully.",/review/rw8657699/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2022,Pairic,8," More Adventure And fun
","Enola Holmes 2: Enola is back and so is Sherlock, indeed he meets two canon characters for the first time in this adventure. But it;s Enola's film as her love interest/sidekick lord Tewkesbury also returns. This time Enola tries to track down a missing match girl but soon finds herself caught up in a murder. A comedy of manners and social commentary (fittingly one of the characters is named Cicely) but also an adventure where Enola gets caught up in a prison break and encounters intrigue, corruption and hypocrisy among the upper classes. Once again Enola is pretty nifty with her fists. The historical background is spot on, set in the period leading up ro the historic Match Girls Strike. Directed by Harry Bradbeer from a screenplay by Jack Thorne. On Netflix. 8/10.",/review/rw8657699/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,RebelPanda,5," Doesn't live up to the first
","Not as fun or fast paced as the original, just average. A new approach to the story would be welcomed if it wasn't simply trying to recreate the first film, but without the tight script and carefully considered directing. It just feels like a first draft that needed more time in the editing room. There are dozens of obvious mistakes, or easy fixes that could make the film better...",/review/rw8657699/?ref_=tt_urv

6 November 2022,harry_tk_yung,," keep them coming
","Those who enjoyed ""Enola Holmes"" (2020) will be pleased with this sequel that brings back most of the familiar characters. Sherlock Holmes (Henry Cavill) has a stronger role this time, as a case he is investigating eventually converges with Enola's. Light flirting with young nobleman Tewkesbury (Louis Partridge) blossoms into true romance. Mother Eddoria (Helena Bonham Carter) and her buddy Edith (Susan Wokoma) the jujitsu instructor are there whenever Enola needs them. Good old Lestrade (Adeel Akhtar) will of course always be around when Sherlock is. Life-long fans of 221B Baker Street will be delighted to see two key characters finally appearing. Watson is just a cameo. Moriarty, Holmes's arch-nemesis, comes with a devilish twist that would be felony to reveal.",/review/rw8657699/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2022,exceladeogun,8," A thrilling and triumphant sequel
","A thrilling and triumphant sequel. Drawing from real life occurrences, Enola Holmes 2 is quirky and complex with a good amount of twists. This sequel doesn't try to stray from the first movie and is an easy continuation from it. The fourth wall breaking from the protagonist is always delightful to see. Beautiful costuming, and setting.",/review/rw8657699/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,yonahgoldberg,7," If you liked the first, you would love this.
","I really enjoyed this sequel. They took every thing good about the first film, and turned up the dial. For a avrege sherlock holmes enjoyed, this film is full of fun to be had. The story, like the first film, giving a nice prospective for real world events, and sums them up quite nicely. The acting in this film is great, and aspecialy Henry Cavil's, who stole the show every moment he was on screen. One small flaw that annoyed me was that unlike thw first one, whitch clearly had kids in mind, this one has quite a few scenes, which might be considerd too gory for the younger audience, while still having quite a few jokes and moment that seem to he targeted and smaller children.",/review/rw8657699/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,rjgrund-123-603438,6," Good until it wasn't.
",Went woke in the last 30 minutes with a surprising unnecessary twist. A ridiculous twist that feeds the woke Hollywood machine. Do they not realize America is tired of it? Wasted efforts by all involved. And the efforts of the cast and director was undone by the writers. It was fun and entertaining until then. The chemistry between Cavill and Brown is worth the time for the first 90 minutes. They are amazing together and the screen lights up. More of them together is worth it. Henry Cavill brings a new texture to Sherlock Holmes. Millie Bobby Brown is incredible and sparkles. But a female .... and a ...Watch and see for yourself.,/review/rw8657699/?ref_=tt_urv
