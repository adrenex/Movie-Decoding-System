9 October 2022,and_shove_it_up_your_butt,8," Yasss, Mila!!! YES!!!
","I can't tell you how many women I know, myself included, who has survived sexual abuse and in just about every case there is shame, loss and silencing. I was molested by a family member as a child, and I carried that with me for years. I still carry it with me and it's totally molded me into a different version of myself I always imagined I could have been had that not been the start of the downhill snowball effect in my life. My family swept it under the rug for the most part, and I saw my molester on a regular basis after that as if nothing ever happened. It was a family member, you see. All's fair in family and abuse, right?",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,nidhunmoviebuff,8," Mila Kunis is a force of nature in this disturbing, but profound take on the lasting scars of sexual assault
","Movies depicting the aftermath of a sexual assault are incredibly difficult to watch and often too triggering for many to sit through, but deliver some of the most profound and impactful filmmaking we have seen on screen of late, be it the Oscar-nominated ""Promising Young Woman (2020)"" or the moving Netflix series ""Unbelievable (2019)"". Although ""Luckiest Girl Alive"" doesn't rise to such astronomic levels in terms of pure craft, the Mila Kunis starrer is a chilling account of how society's first reaction to such assault is always victim-shaming and how toxic masculinity continues to be celebrated.",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2022,Frankiesupafly,8," If you've not dealt with trauma, you won't get this movie
","I'm one of those people who rarely comments on IMDB threads, but for this movie, I HAD to ""write up"". As someone who did experience a traumatic event, and like Ani, it hardened me and made me appear indifferent and calculating (when I was seething within), I can honestly state that this is the most honest and raw depiction of how someone can deal with multiple traumatic events by ""armouring"" themselves.",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,Sarah423,8," Trauma's impact
","The movie starts slowly as we get to know Ani, through her actions, inner monologue, and a series of flashbacks.",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,Xstal,8," Smashes the Proverbials Out of the Park...
","The luckiest girl alive, had to dig deep to survive, to establish a career, to crack down on all her fear, give the scars their time to heal, reconnect the nerves that feel, gain the courage to fight back, after multiple attacks.",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,katiebugg-49971,7," A disturbing plot executed in such a way that makes you truly understand trauma. Don't read reviews! Go into the movie with no expectation!
","My advice is to go into this movie with no expectation... in other words, stop reading the reviews! Lol! I think the lack of expectations makes this movie the masterpiece that it is. -- Luckiest Girl Alive, what a great movie!!! The third person dialogue really nudges this movie beyond great in my opinion. Couldn't have chosen a better actress for this role. Mila is amazing as always! The mystery of ""what happened"" is executed so well. Revealing small pieces of the puzzle without revealing the full plot was executed wonderfully. I truly wasn't sure what direction the movie was going to go in. The direction it did end up going was unexpected and dark, and it was done so well. Sadly it's very relatable being a young woman. The trauma she lives with and the person she turns herself into is exactly what survivors go through every day. And the ""villain"" in this movie, is so typical... I highly recommend this movie, and if you're able to watch it with a boyfriend or a brother, even better!",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,Phantasma_the_Black,9," A beautiful approach to sensitive matters
","I have to say, I had my fair share of the doubt during the first 30 minutes or so, because it started off as a typical rom com with a quirky protagonist.",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,dfloro,7," Mila Kunis earns an extra star for this one
","This was adapted for the screen by the author of the novel of the same title, as befits something that's clearly based on an all-too-true story. As it's star and producer, Mila Kunis, has said: we've all got terribly messy junk in our pasts so we can relate. Of course, that messy junk isn't usually multiple capital felonies and horrific school shootings, but nevertheless I know what she means. A lot of us just choose to block it all out and even deny it ever happened. This movie is a powerful demonstration of why that won't work in the long term, and we must stand and face it. Ms. Kunis, as well as the young actress playing her character in school-age flashbacks, make this movie worth an extra star in my ratings.",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,la_rubiecita,8," Difficult subject matter treated beautifully
","Considering that 1 in 6 women have been sexually assaulted in the US, this movie was long overdue. The ease at which the boys groom her, thinking nothing of gang raping this girl the day after except that she needs to get morning after pills, feels so real. Mila Kunis was excellent in this movie, but Chiara Aur√©lia deserves our absolute admiration here.",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,robmilnerfhm-63116,8," More traumatic than expected but made a point.
",It was fairly obvious that this film would be about some form of sexual assult as well as a gun massacre however the assult itself was more severe than I had anticipated and not nice to watch. Unfortunately I think the scenes were needed so the impact was properly understood.,/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,jasminn_tan,7," Read the warnings before watching
","I thought this movie was very nuanced; it deals with sexual assault against the backdrop of gun violence. The sexual assault scenes weren't too explicit but even so, they were difficult for me to watch. The actress who played young Ani was exceptional. The school shooting seemed like a plot device to me meant to make the entire story more mysterious.",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,thestateisgreen,10," Open your eyes.
","Luckiest Girl Alive provides us an insight into the complicated reality that survivors endure on a daily basis. Flippant comments made by friends, family members, and strangers, rooted in their own fear and bias, become obvious when we view them through a victim's lens. The way this movie offers nearly every single nuanced judgment that people place on SA survivors is both dark and brilliant. My sincere hope with this film is that laypeople will wake-up to the realities of how our society continues to re-victimize SA victims. Due to the stigma, many people will not watch this movie, which sucks. It's such a necessary film.",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,MazzyMayhem-117-544511,8," Great film, even better book
","When I saw the trailer for this film, I was very intrigued. So much so that I read the book. I loved the book and the way the layers of Ani's story are peeled back.",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," A missed opportunity that needed much better writing and directing.
","Knoll should stick to writing books, not screenplays. In the convoluted, incohesive and dragged out 113 minute runtime, the story is all over the place, with poorly placed timeline tidbits, and ridiculous and mostly unnecessary scenes and dialogue.",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2022,christie-21536,9," A film about how trauma festers
","This film is an incredibly well done look at trauma and how it festers inside of you if you have no support system and never deal with it. It's about the reality you build around you to avoid having to think about that trauma, and about the battle you fight every single day to feel normal.",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2022,rammvier,6," Something is wrong with this movie
","I cannot put my finger on what was wrong with this movie. The story was good. I am not sure where it went wrong. It could have been Mila's performance, the perfect rich unicorn boyfriend, the one dimensional characters or the editing. First of all, the movie could have been much shorter. Second of all, it failed to make me care much about Mila's character. I don't know why. She had a good story and I understood what she went through. I think it's how she acted, it was a bit off, one dimensional. Actually all the characters were one dimensional. It was annoying in a sense, same stereotypes and say exactly what you expect them to say. And the boyfriend was just so patient and perfect it makes one nauseous. It felt unrealistic. It's one of those movies, that I am not sure if I am happy I watched or not.",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,michelle_kummer,10," Mila welcome back..
","I am a huge fan of Mila Kunis and so happy she's back on the screen. Ashton is one lucky man to be married to this talented, naturally beautiful woman. This film speaks for many women who have been victim of bullying and sexual assault. Feeling broken, shattered and as she says a wind up doll that will tell you what you want to hear. Mila played this role perfectly this film keeps you guessing as to whether or not she was involved in the shooting. I think it's a shame she didn't end up with Luke but can understand that she despised him as he reminded her of the rapists, entitled through their wealth that they can basically get away with anything. I thought they had great chemistry and it would have been nice to see them marry. Ani was a broken woman and anyone who suffers such trauma is never really the same again. The scars are too deep. Therefore thank you Mila for your portrayal of Ani and for coming back to the screen.",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,h2223,4," Eh, pretty disappointing
","I was excited about a bit of a glossy film with a dark, slightly complicated plot that might include a twist (that's how the trailer seemed to portray the film).",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,ljdavies-84383,8," Good analysis of sensitive issues
","I thought this was interesting take on a very sensitive topic that happens all too often. The film shows the impact of traumatic events and the decisions people take as a result of what happens to them. Whether that is negative or positive, or when we simply do not listen.",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,catfanatic888,7," Not a Thriller but Still Worthwhile
","I am frequently disappointed by movies tagged as thrillers that are not. This is more of a drama about a sensitive subject, Ani is a good protagonist for this story. She is beautiful, intelligent, highly professional at work who is trying to run from her past tragedy that she has not emotionally dealt with. Some don't believe her. Others are compassionate but nobody really SEES ANI. They don't feel her pain or see that she's really suffering even though it seems like her life is a success. Mila Kunis is very talented and shines in this dark role. The one thing that is irritating is all the back and forth between her past experiences with the younger actors playing the same roles and the current storyline. Ani is a survivor though with a dark past.",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,Lenobia,10," A very valuable drama in today's world, lessons to be made for everyone
","Amazing acting from Mila Kunis and a very touching subject that has been treated carefully in this production. It has the power to change the perception of people on sexual abuse and the use of alcohol. It shows the effect of societal pressure that we all experience daily, starting from very early ages, on a woman's life and decisions. It shows the struggle one goes through between wanting to build a peaceful, stable life and wanting to bring justice to the ones that have hurted you, that have violated your rights at the expense of ruining your reputation. This struggle, is unfortunately very real for most of us living in societies where we are usually only supported when acted in expected ways and when talked about pleasant subjects rather than pointing out the real problems of society. It is not only women that experience this pressure but it must have been the same for a lot of men as well.",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,kofila,4," Should have been about hour shorter
","The first hour was really hard to bear for me.. A lot of stiff looks, talks about nothing, dull atmosphere, average acting, so many monologues... Then it gets some rhytm and energy and it seems like some interesting ending might be coming. But after few minutes of hope it just gets back to the blandness and after some sort of finale I looked at the timeline and 30 minutes were still left. Oh boy... Last part is really pointless and the real ending is just so naive and awkward it just makes you wonder what was the point of this movie? Why is the soundtrack so random? What is it about and why do I feel so tired now?",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,Ken_ZomgWtfBbq,7," Made just well enough that it doesn't trivilalize it's serious subject matter
",Film is an interesting blend.,/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,craiglesuk-1,6," Almost gave up...,
","The 1st 30 minutes of this movie is almost unbearable. I'm not a fan of voice overs at the best of times but this was overkill beyond belief. Just when I was thinking I can't stand having every scene described to me in detail like I'm a complete imbecile, the voice over narrative backed off a bit and allowed the story to tell itself. Apparently the Novelist adapted her own book. Big mistake. She's clearly just lifted chunks from her Novel and used as voice over to set the scene rather than use dialogue. As I say, once the story got going and the writer didn't feel so compelled to have a voice over explain everything, the story became quite compelling. It's a pity someone didn't step in and re write at least the 1st half of the film. Could have been so much better. If you can get past the 1st 30 mins, it's worth a watch.",/review/rw8612906/?ref_=tt_urv
