3 May 2020,brucemiddlemissphotography,9," Explaining the swearing!!
",I agree with all the positive comments on here but just wanted to address the swearing at the kids.,/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2020,mstaffordca,10," Oh good lord thank you so much for this masterpiece
","For the love of god! Finally a realistic depiction of life with kids! I'm so sick of the shows about families and the parents always seem to have quiet uninterrupted time to talk, time to do grown-up things, time to themselves, what an absolute joke that is! There is no such thing when you have kids! Its an absolute s**t show all the time!! This is true reality tv! Thank you! It's about time! I haven't laughed this hard ever! Just thank you!!!! Masterpiece! MORE PLEASE!! MANY MANY MANY MORE!",/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2020,geeboy37,8," Definitely not a comedy
","I think sometimes the genre descriptions on here can be misleading since when I first saw this show on IMDB I assumed it was just a straight up comedy about parenting and relationships, which it is not. Yes there are comedic elements, especially if you also have kids, but its way more dramatic than I expected and I mean that in a positive way. For me I was about 3 episodes in and couldn't decide whether I liked it or not(partly because I was expecting a comedy) but my advice is to stay with it, get invested in the characters and don't make any attempt to categorize the show. In general I would say this show is extremely unique and also very close to reality.",/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2020,lewilewis1997,9," Effing Brilliant...!
","Two thirty somethings totally out of their depth but muddling on through, although mum (Daisy Haggard) is slightly more on top of things, but aren't they always? Dialogue that made me scream in a laugh out loud way. The days start out chaotic and a constant stream of bad luck will culminate in a comedy of errors that have been beautifully crafted. All accompanied by a stream of eff's.
Swearing is a lot more common these days, the puritans have been proven wrong by many studies, smart people swear, it's now a scientific fact. It's a social glue, a vent for frustration, it's even effective as a pain reliever.
By the end of ep 3, dad, (Martin Freeman) is starting to question his parenting 'skills' and realise that maybe he needs to stop shouting and swearing so much. But I think that his short fuse and constant frustration will sabotage his new found resolve.
Kids don't come with a manual and we've all learned from our mistakes, they survive and continue to love us, luckily. It's nice to see others going through the ringer, I almost got broody but I've done my bit, never again!
Thanks for this Marmite show, people are either loving or hating it. If you hate it too? Lighten up, the scenes with the kids in were filmed without swearing and then it's dubbed over. The little darlings were perfectly fine.
I hope this show runs for a few more years.",/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2020,david.sampson1,8," Bloody hilarious
","Very funny from the off and doesn't let up, the episode about death was pant wettingly hilarious. The idiots giving it low scores due to swearing or suggesting it is unrealistic and just bad parenting need to a) stop being snowflake prudes and b) realise it's a comedy not a documentary. You'll be telling me next that Monty Python and the Holy Grail isn't a true reflection of Arthurian Britain or that Arthur didn't actually exist.",/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2020,sipa_p,6," Gradual
","I very much like the show but I am getting increasingly annoyed with the character of Ally. While Paul is a complex character, realistic and human, Ally seems to be portrayed like a super woman, relaxed mother and cool wife, succesfull, desirable, etc. - I am struggling to find a fault with her. The show would be much more relevant and credible if she was portrayed as a multi-dimensional human being as well, warts and all.",/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2021,bshaef,8," One of the Best Shows on TV
","The writers have outdone themselves. I watched an episode by accident and now I wouldn't miss one for the world. The family is so darn normal, warts and all, that's what makes this show so outstanding. They cuss, the kids lie to their parents, but in the end they are a very strong loving unit. That's what makes the show.",/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2020,jonson-anna,8," Haven't giggled this much in ages
",My husband and I are so so tired we barely know who we are anymore. We have a 6 months baby still waking up 4 times a night and a 3 years old not wanting to sleep alone anymore.,/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2020,olafauske,8," Excellent dialogue!
",I love the chemistry between the main characters and how their children are both the joy and the misery in their life! Excellently executed!,/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv

",Good show hope there is another season. Martin Freeman is brilliant in it.,/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2020,colinsoder,10," Darkly true to life and absolutely hilarious
","I didn't know other people behaved the way I did! This isn't the same old story about parenthood, either, about how the kids are monsters. This is a story about how the PARENTS can be monsters-who still love their kids.This series documents, in an honestly and in a way that I've never seen on TV before, the psychological effects being married and having kids has on you. There are scenes that they could have stolen right from my home security system video footage...Shockingly realistic. Glad I'm not the only one to scream and yell like a madman...",/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2020,glenn_gallagher,10," Funniest Show in Years !!! If you have kids and a healthy pulse you will love this show.
","Words cant describe how ""real"" the struggle is but this show nails it !!!
IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, YOUR CHURCH GOING GRANDMOTHER WROTE THEM.
I love these FX series like 'Married' 'Your the Worst' and 'Breeders' certainly doesn't disappoint. If you have kids and they are driving you mental, bribe them with candy, lock yourself and your wife, husband, partner in the bedroom with a bottle of red wine and press play!
Laugh out loud funny and extremely honest. As a 37 year old father with teenagers and toddlers I felt like these characters were based on my daily life. As an Australian living in the US I also felt so at home with the english characters as a great cultural bridge, my wife is American and hates my language with the kids but that's the culture a lot of people grow up in!!!
Highly recommend this show and again if you have kids the first episode will hook you 100%.",/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2021,thepeculiarpalette,7," Childless American here.
","I'm a sucker for an English accent and although I'm not a 'kid person' per se, I always said if mine could come out with an English accent maybe I'd consider having one. All the English kids I've met in person and seen on TV until now have always sounded adorable and seemed to have excellent manners. The oldest boy in this show proved me wrong within the first 2 minutes of episode 1. This is how I always assumed it would be like having children, and watching this confirmed that I made the right decision ðŸ˜‚",/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2020,rosstelfer,8," Brilliant show, very realistic, hard edged
","I laughed my ass off constantly at this show, I have a 9 year old and my god has she tested my patience, I totally relate to their behaviour and I found it painfully funny. All the bad reviews literally state the overuse of bad language, but this is the way people talk these days. Highly recommended.",/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2020,betts-danny,7," Truly brilliant!
",I'm British and love British humour. This is really a fantastic programme and had me and my wife laughing out loud. It also has a really interesting story and you grow to like the characters quickly. Martin Freeman plays his role so well.,/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2020,ang066,10," Amazing show! Hilariously accurate. Don't listen to the negative reviews
",Parenting is hard! It's definitely no walk in the park. This show tackles real feelings that many parents experience. Don't listen to the cry babies on here complaining about the jokes in the show.,/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2021,goodalan-82191,8," Comedy??
",Good show well acted not though a comedy I think.,/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2020,gwenette-spann,9," Seriously funny if you have kids you can relate
","I just started watching today March 8th, 2020 and I can't help but laugh out loud literally. I have one child and she's 31 years old now, but I truly remember moments like some of the ones they experience on Breeders, I love this show so far so good , comedies or like tredgies turned backwards. Plus living in a Trump era gosh we all need some good laughter to keep from being so freaking in the dumps.",/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2020,bradyvincent,10," Best comedic series I've seen in years
","Martin Freeman is awesome in this series. All parents feel rage towards their children but this is what it really looks like. These guys love their kids to death, but they can't control their anger towards them. It's great.",/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2021,Mahi-chan,9," The writing is great and the cast are brilliant!
","Good writing, good casting, and good pacing; this show has all the main components necessary for good entertainment. It takes a look at parenting from a different angle, and offers an amusing experience with its particular kind of humor.",/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2021,danbull-20427,5," Great 1st series, not so second
","Watch the first series it's brilliant. Don't listen to those complaining about how he speaks to his kids, that's the point, it's what we all have thought from time to time. (Anyone that says they haven't they're lying or they're a serial killer without emotion).",/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2020,nancy-793-228879,10," Bloody brilliant
","Laugh out loud funny. What more do you want? Obviously they don't swear in front of the children it's all dubbed, very clever",/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2020,pushbuttonopenmind,10," Funny and original filled with dark humour
","The show combines original and witty dialogue with delicious British dark humour. Martin Freeman is fantastic to watch, and the actors portray a convincing 2020 family. It's fast-paced and each episode so far has been very funny to watch.",/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2020,comicgeekchick,10," Oh. Em. Gee. This show is hysterical.
","First off, I LOVE Martin Freeman and Daisy Haggard. I knew Daisy was hilarious from ""Man Stroke Woman"". I had no idea that Martin was such a comedic genius. Yes, I am a parent. I have a teenage son. And, I absolutely adore my child. I would not survive if anything (implied ""bad"") happened to him. That said, I have always maintained that it's a good thing that babies are so adorable, because they would not survive the first couple of years of child rearing. And, yes, I am kidding when I say that, but, like this show, there is an element of truth to the dark humor. Parents love their children. That does not mean that parenting is happy or easy, it's not. It's the hardest thing I've ever done. But, I wouldn't have it any other way. I laugh each and every day about something that pops out of my child's mouth. And, yes, there are some days when I have to scream into a pillow. The first episode had me giggling. Like a crazy person. It was awesome. I can't wait to see how this develops. If you like Andrea Savage's show, ""I'm Sorry"", you will enjoy this one. If not, this may not be your cuppa, move along. But, if you enjoy the dark side of parenting, then this show deserves a watch. Enjoy.",/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2021,luvireland-11253,8," A great start but....
","So I have found myself losing interest. I just don't know how this couple goes from their busy lifestyle, two kids and only one spare bedroom, dad's anger issues (which hasn't quelled my raging crush on him) to the decision of IVF treatments for another kid. Really? It's a good series, but this recent storyline is odd. Otherwise, Martin Freeman is a hottie.",/review/rw6836030/?ref_=tt_urv
