22 June 2004,bekayess,," Been there, done that. . .this is true to my experiences. . .
","Quick evaluation:  this movie does reflect my experiences of the past 25 years.  As a nearing-50 gay man, I can relate to nearly all the principal characters, both personally and as they relate to my friends and acquaintances.  Yes, at various times in my life I've been the cute, promiscuous one; the lonely one; the gym bunny (no drugs, though); the (self-perceived) ugly one. . .all those have helped me to become a better, more self-actualized person.  Seems there are too many self-loathing queens commenting negatively on this film here. . .maybe they can't see themselves in the characters, but if they were to be honest, they'd realize that they do indeed exist in one or more of these characters.",/review/rw0692999/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greg Berlanti's film is worthy of a lot of praise in a society where gay men tend to only fulfill certain stereotypes. A character, Howie mentions how he would like to see gay men being represented as something other than the woman's best friend, the hustler, the aids victim or the sex addict and this film does tend to try hard to avoid these stereotypes. The script is brilliantly written and sparkles when it is at its peak. At its worst, it may be a little bit cliche ridden but hey..it also has originality ( I have taken ""Meanwhile"" and now its commonplace down ere!) and is not afraid to portray gay men as just a group of lads who are falling in and out of relationships, liek any other group of young men. However certain characters do tend to bring the pace down a little and it does sometimes seem to have the sentiment that gay men have got it so bad compared to everyone else in the world. Timothy Olyphant stands out here in an able cast, made up primarily of TV actors. My only grumble was the inclusion of the lesbian couple who seemed to only be there to represent the ladies and also to give Howie a meatier role. 4/5",/review/rw0692999/?ref_=tt_urv

","That statement is part of what makes this is a terrific film about love, friendship and betrayal -- betrayal of friends, the people you are supposed to care most about and ultimately yourself. This is also a film about facades, lying and truth telling.",/review/rw0692999/?ref_=tt_urv

",The day I was finally able to admit to myself that I was a gay man I rented this movie. That first viewing changed my life. It helped me envision a life a hoped was ahead of me. During my first year of being out I watched this movie so many times and still watch it about once a year.,/review/rw0692999/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2006,lefou22,9," Loved it!
","I know people have their problems with this movie, but I happened to catch it at the perfect time in my life. I think every young gay male should watch this movie and see that there is life after coming out. It's nice to see a gay movie that isn't a GAY movie. The main characters all happen to be gay, but that is not the focal point of the movie. There is no sub-plots about AIDS or dealing with same-sex marriages or disapproving parents. The movie starts when all that stuff has already happened. It really makes you think. Two thumbs up! The cast is superb. Although not superstars, the movie has some well seasoned actors; including Fraiser star John Mahoney. Zach Braff does an excellent job as does Andrew Keegan, Dean Caine and of course Timothy Olyphant. Kerr Smith also has a small cameo but well worth it. This movie begins to break down the stereotypes of gay men and comes up with some great gay lingo that my friends and I have adopted.",/review/rw0692999/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2005,jotix100,7," The boys in the Santa Monica softball team
","We watched this film when it first was released. On second viewing, thanks to the IFC channel, ""The Broken Hearts Club"" looks a bit dated since more daring films and television series have come out of the closet recently. It must have been a courageous undertaking by its director, Greg Berlanti, in 2000, at a time that gays were not as prominent as now. The director shows a positive side of the gay life that is not seen often, in that all the characters have values and integrity, something not often seen in mainstream films.",/review/rw0692999/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2004,R_O_U_S,8," Amen, sister
","How un-promising does a gay male Sex In The City sound? This one took me quite by surprise. It's a frequently very funny romantic comedy, that only occasionally dips into cliche. Why America remade Queer As Folk when they already had this is beyond me. Is ""Queer as folk"" ever an expression over there? Anyway, this includes Frasier's Dad and Superman amongst its gay baseball team, so it's good in my book.",/review/rw0692999/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2006,jdburkitt,8," An intelligent comedy
","As a mature (61) gay man, I enjoyed the hell out of this film. At least there was a diversity of stereotypes. I guess it would be boring to show that most gays lead ""regular"" lives in all kinds of workplaces. The angst was, thankfully, less ""Dawson's Creek"" and more universal. The experienced straight actors helped it flow along nicely, a cut above the usual sloppy, Indie-style gay movie. The Lesbian subplot should have been expanded--or left out! I recommend this movie to all young lesbians and gays facing a still altogether ignorant homophobic society---but one that has improved since I was their age. Kudos to the people behind the camera too!",/review/rw0692999/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2005,RiotGurl31979,10," The Broken Hearts Club is a masterpiece
","The Broken Hearts Club is one of the most genius films I have ever seen. I love the way each character is conveyed differently, proving the homosexual male stereotype wrong. This movie is very warm and heart-felt bringing a connection to the viewer and the characters.This film is smart, and a well put together comedy that will definitely have viewers laughing, crying, smiling, fussing, and cheering until the very end. I recommend everyone have an open-mind and see this film. There are few films that I would say won my heart after seeing it but The Broken Hearts Club did just that. This film shows that homosexual males go through many similar situations that heterosexual males also go through . This movie sends many different positive messages to it's audience. I definitely respect this film 100 percent. The Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comdey deserves a standing ovation.",/review/rw0692999/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2002,moonspinner55,2," Hopeless!
","A group of fickle, flighty gay men talk about their non-existent love lives while roaming the streets of Hollywood, CA. Aside from John Mahoney (as the only responsible adult in the bunch), the characters are jaded twenty-somethings who all speak in the same bitchy idiom. Their love lives are ""non-existent"" simply to skirt the still-controversial issue of showing two men in bed together. The film doesn't have the courage of its convictions and, though some of the one-liners might provoke a stray chuckle or two, the loosely-hinged plot isn't absorbing. This, coupled with a low-budget and an uncharismatic cast, makes ""Broken Hearts"" a chore to get through. * from ****",/review/rw0692999/?ref_=tt_urv

","OK, so the movie may p**s a bunch of people off because of the subject (GAY) or because it looks like a bunch of hotties that just want to mess around (isn't that what all gay people do?) My offering is, isn't that what most people do, gay, straight, or bi? The film works because the characters are real, the druggie, the pretty boy who sleeps with everything and anyone, the one who has the wonderful marriage to the guy who is screwing around. Don't we know people like this all the time?",/review/rw0692999/?ref_=tt_urv

","Story of friendship. romantic bitter comedy. a version of Sex in The City. and the right cast. its basic virtue - the state after its final credits. it has the comfortable name of emotion. but it is more. a mixture of unusual portrait of a community, vulnerable, powerful, ball of personal stories and confessions and sport and vulnerabilities. and this does it special. like a sort of fairy tale. without the happy end. a realistic portrait of a way to live. and to define reality. like the map of a fortress . in which the love has different nuances. a film about an universe. admirable, fragile, strange, pink and profound male.",/review/rw0692999/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a movie, with the right direction, could make a great television series. Think about it, a diverse cast, granted some common stereotypes, but we all need to indentify with someone. A great location for a series, West Hollywood, where else would the gay man for the US Heartland want to be? And actors who throughout the movie developed quite nicely.

28 March 2001,Bil-3,," *** Charming little film
","The first studio film to feature an all-gay lead cast since The Boys In The Band isn't everything it tries to convince you it is, but it's really enjoyable all the same. Succeeding more in its comedic moments than when it tries to get too serious, I found that the director never really developed his characters enough for me to really feel there for them in their more tender scenes. However, it IS very very funny and there was nothing standing in my way of thoroughly liking it. Great cast with very appealing personalities.",/review/rw0692999/?ref_=tt_urv

But I do remember when I realized it was okay:  When I met my friends.""  This movie is a testament to the value of friendships, and while my own group of friends is a bit deeper than these guys are, I think we all share experiences with them. Some lovely points are made in this film.",/review/rw0692999/?ref_=tt_urv
