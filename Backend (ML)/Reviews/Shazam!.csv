29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Continues to build the Power Universe!
","Power Book III: Rasing Kanan is the third of show in the Power Universe. This one is about a young Kanan Stark (50 Cents character from the original) and how he joins his family's growing and dangerous drig business. It takes place in Queens, New York during the 1990's. It quickly builds its world and expands the Power Universe but definitely stands on its own. The do a great job bringing you into their world, especially with all the attention to detail of how the 90's were. Even if you weren't a fan of the Kanan character in the original, you'll still enjoy this. You don't even have to watch the original to like this but if you are already a fan of the Power Universe I promise you won't be disappointed here.",/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv

","9 out of 10 I enjoy this tv series, the style the acting, the music all fantastic it's a good show overall violence sex drugs would recommend if you are a power fan.",/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Stands on it's own!
","Following the huge success of Power they decided to start their own universe (kind of like the MCU or DCEU). There are now 3 spin-offs of Power...Book II: Ghost, Book III: Raising Kanon and Book IV: Force. This is Book III: Raising Kanon about 50 Cents character Kanon and shows how he grew up in the early 90's and became the man he is in Power. I was worried about the Power Universe when they first announced it thinking it might be too much but I was wrong. Every spin-off is good in its own right and can stand on its own even if you didn't see the original Power. Much like Book II: Ghost with Tariq, you don't have to be a fan of Kanon to enjoy the show. These spin-offs are doing just as well as the original so I don't see them going anywhere anytime soon so I'm looking forward to more seasons in the future of each of them. If you're a fan of the original Power or a fan of gangster shows then give this a try.",/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,Advocate1,10," Do you love Patina Miller as much as I do?
",The best of the Power Empire in my Opinion. Great acting. Great writing. Great cinematography. This show is one of the best on TV period. Patina Miller is a superstar!!,/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2021,Stealthy-22960,6," Conflicted
","They truly captured the essence of early 90s from the clothes, to hair styles, to the music, to the cars, to the slang and vernacular, etc. Well done, truly. The problem with period pieces though is that the story has to be incredibly good or with a solid character or important person that the audience truly cares about, otherwise no one wants to keep seeing some back in time era just for the sake of it. As such, I'm not sure if we really need to see the details of Kanan and Jukebox upbringing since we know how they turned out and how neither of them had any redeeming qualities on the original Power. Simply, they weren't empathic characters on the original Power, so I don't care about their prequel. Kanan is responsible for the development of the worst character in TV history - Tariq - and responsible for the most loved character on Power - Ghost. Sure Tariq was going to feel some type of way about Ghost leaving the home for Angie, but what Kanan did to that boy psychologically was the direct cause of that knucklehead boy getting his sister killed and murdering his dad. So no, I don't want to see a show about Kanan!",/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2022,loozzotys,9," Mich better than Power Book Ghost
","The acting and story is much better than Power Book Ghost where the actors that player Cooper Saxe and Tariq were so bad. In Raising Kanan, the actor who played little Kanan is much better than the actor who played Tariq in Power book ghost.. The Story and dialogue is much more believable and the cinematography is better in Raising Kanan.",/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2021,leoseimetz,10," I love the Power universe!
","Just finished the tenth episode of the first season, and I have to say: oh boy, what a show!",/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2021,jimsweezey,8," Great Standalone Series
","This series is FAR superior to Power Book 2: Ghost. The main reason being the young lead actor is much better than the kid who plays Tariq St. Patrick. I just find him incredibly unlikeable and I always know I'm watching an actor put on his character. Now the gentlemen who plays Kanaan is clearly doing his best 50 Cent impression but the surround cast is really, really good.",/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2021,rob-lentini,7," Best So Far
","In my opinion this series is the best in the Power Universe so far. Kanan is the most interesting of all the characters, hope there is a season 2 & more.",/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2021,Ashitaka137,9," Really good start.
",The actors did a really good job in this pilot episode; and i'm liking the way 50 is narrating important moments; and i think it's great that Kanan didn't start out as a psycho like Dadinho /Zé Pequeno(Lil Ze) and that instead we get to see how and what turned him into a cold blooded killer. And the atmosphere of the greatest era in American Hip Hop is definitely a major +.,/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2021,opusv5,9," Probably the best Power entry yet
","This back-story of one of ""Power's"" central characters may be the series's strongest entry yet, if only because it emphasizes character development and conflict, as well as realistic plotting and dialogue, rather than quick pace and violence (though there is violence). The characters are believable and well played, their dialogue authentic to the milieu (Joey Bada$$ being particularly effective as such). I hope the follow-up series keeps up the good work.",/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,Sejimon101,10," The Black ""Godfather""
","This series is phenomenal, not merely because of the cast & writing, but because it's apart of a cohort of tv series birthed from the masterpiece that is ""Power."" Kanan was undoubtedly one of Power's most dynamic characters. To see his story play out is to watch him become the man who would later successfully infiltrate his mentees' (Ghost & Tommy) drug organization & who would plant the seed of disdain in Ghost's son that would one day lead to Tariq committing patricide.",/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2021,adriano-40012,10," Surprised & Thrilled
",I just finished the season 1 and read on Instagram Sascha Penn's post about big magazines & Media publications in general. It hurts that they ignore this series for reasons I can't understand. This show deserves more appreciation and fair ratings.,/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2022,richkyle,8," The Raq Show!
",Patina Miller is the number one reason to watch. She embodied the character of Raq. The supporting characters are great as well like Joey BadA$$. There is a very heartbreaking episode that had me tearing up. Great gritty atmosphere. I can't say good enough things about it. The best Power Book entry so far!,/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2021,Sarge2020,10," Absolutely fantastic! A great show!
","This is a stunning show, probably best Powerbook so far. Acting is great, music is great, story is great.",/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2021,dgtzdltd,7," Very Good Series!!
","Great oldschool NY vibes and energy in there!!Cool characters, acting is on point. As a fan on Power series I was very happy with this one because it is very interesting to understand how Kenan became a stone cold killer. Worth my time 7/10✌",/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2021,supremekingtorri,8," Slow Start, Ending Well
","It started off slowly, however as the season goes on the pace picks up. I know Kanan being an intelligent nice kid is throwing folks off, but I like how it is progressing. You slowly but surely see the transformation into who he will eventually become. Hang in there, it only gets better.",/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2021,byersk-06559,10," Incredible Series!
","I love how this is set in the early 90s. Good times. But anyways, the writing is unreal. Absolute great story telling, cast is on point and it is very unpredictable. I love drama in movies and this is the perfect storm. Every episode gets better and better every week. I am so hooked to this show. Keep them coming! I am also glad to see that it got renewed for season 2 already. Yeay!",/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2021,NS47,10," dope
","The show is pretty good, some mopey stuff here and there but mostly baller. Marvin is the best character by a mile. Also the only man ever to rock that haircut and not come off like a loser.",/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2021,harrisrobroz,10," A Home is not a Home
",The series rock. The casting and acting is top notch. This combined with outstanding writing creates rich texture. I feel and understand the characters to the point that I lose my moral compass at times.,/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2021,hnlminds,9," The universe that keeps on giving!
","The Power Universe as the STARZ show runners are calling their series of shows. These are all enjoyable shows, displaying street life with a glitz and glamor like no other. 50 Cent needs his props for this production. Raising Kanen is a great show if you enjoy urban crime shows or just someone looking for a new something to watch. The acting is pretty good but the wardrobe and cinematography really make this show great just like the previous Books of Power.",/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2021,elliotjeory,1," The show sucks
",Has every cliche you have ever seen before. It's get rich or die tryin the TV series. They are really milking this and it has to stop.,/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2021,iamtabiyus,10," The Dark Knight meets Courtney Kemp - This is the Christopher Nolan version of Power: Superb
",This is absolutely the best in the entire Power Series. Patina Miller should get an Emmy. She's one of the best characters out since Ghost & Tommy.,/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2021,bartoszrabiej,8," Great start
",Just watched first episode and I gotta say that it looks dope! Can't wait for the rest of them! I really enjoyed 50's narration.,/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2021,dmacaiodh,8," Wait for it
","I'm glad I waited until episode 7 to review because I would have agreed with the current rating of 7. I knew it had potential to be more and it finally delivered with this past episode. We see the consequences of this business and Kanan's ambition, both in the community and personally. I was on the edge of my seat even though I knew what was about to happen. I'm left with a pit in my stomach and 50's speech at the end was perfect for the situation... and in reality. Solid 8 now and hope it goes up.",/review/rw7314975/?ref_=tt_urv
