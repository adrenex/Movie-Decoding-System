23 March 2020,Her-Excellency,10," Rabidly Romantically Unromantic Story about Love and Other Human Frailties
","Because Closer is, in a way, like sneaking a peek behind the closed doors of people we know, or more so, like looking in a mirror when we are at our most base and humanly human, some people seem to be viscerally turned off by it, as is apparent by a few of its more negative reviews.",/review/rw1204224/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2004,ShannonAmidala,10," Very good
","I've been hearing lots of negativity about this movie. I think a lot of people have been shocked, frankly, by the raw and rough nature of the film. Having read the play, I've been looking forward to it for about a year now, and it's honestly one of the best plays I've ever read. Mike Nichols presents it in an amazing way, very faithful to the words as they're written (and they should be, for the movie is also written by the man who wrote the play, the brilliant Patrick Marber).

","Don't be fooled by the names in the cast. Natalie Portman, Jude Law and especially Julia Roberts (if you want, you can throw Clive Owen into the mix too)! This is not your typical romantic movie. So be warned!!",/review/rw1204224/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2004,rcavellero,9," DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO PERFECTION!
","It's once in a very rare time that I go to the movies and I'm treated as an adult. I see a film that is intelligent, thought provoking, provocative and rawly realistic. Closer is that film. It present an honest portrayal of four severely unlikable characters and they screw with each others love lives back and forth. The film is told in adult sporting complexity through the growing plot points , the way it's filled and it's tasty advancing dialogue. Everyone in the film turns in a powerhouse performance worthy of Oscar consideration. Ms. Portman is wonderful as Alice shedding her blockbuster star wars acting skills and portraying someone multi dimensional with heart and pizazz. Julia Roberts stars as Anna in a cold, subtle performance which will leave audiences appreciating her acting believability as she pounces through each of her scenes with charismatic force. Jude law and Clive Owen are the real surprises here both turning in wonderfully appealing performance. Strong, weak, flawed and memorable. Especially whose last outing was the entertaining but mediocre action summer pic King Arthur. The film has wonderfully tight direction and sports beautifully placid colors and a fine adult score. The film draws dangerously close to being a near perfect film. I only wish it could've gone on for abit longer I wasn't completely satisfied to the ends of the characters on which we were give. but life itself isn't perfect or satisfying and this is a slick of someones life. Rush out and go see Closer! Oner of the best film's of the year!",/review/rw1204224/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2004,marcosaguado,8," I Stayed To The End
","What a treat. Most of the people who came with me, left, half way through the film. I stayed to the end and I loved it. It moved me. A rarity this days. The face of Jude Law is, still, so full of possibilities. He seems unafraid of darkness. Strong. This is his most grown up performance. I can't wait to see what he'll become. (If he stays away from Hollywood as much as temptations permit, and keeps that purity, that makes his darkness so powerful, as intact as humanly possible). Julia Roberts is wonderful in a performance part Margaret Sullavan, part Jeanne Moreau but all her own. Clive Owen is a force of nature. Dangerous, compelling, human to the hilt. And what about Natalie Portman? Wow. No surprise here. But what a surprise. I'm sure she is going to amaze us for years and years to come. I'm really glad I stayed to the end.",/review/rw1204224/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2004,arichmondfwc,8," Who's afraid of Closer?
","Mike Nichols directed, in my opinion, one of the three best adaptations from stage to screen. ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf"" (The other two being Sidney Lumet's ""Long day's journey into night"" and Elia Kazan's ""A Streetcar named Desire) After the extraordinary television adaptation of ""Angels in America"" I also would have pleaded with Mike Nichols to do ""Closer"" Sorry I'm rambling. What I'm trying to say in a rather convoluted way is, simply, thank you Mr. Nichols. Adult themes, conceived and performed by adult artists. I hope it makes zillions of dollars so we can have more of it. Jude Law is a Peter O'Toole without the steroids, Julia Roberts a Jeanne Moreau with an American passport, Clive Owen is a child of John Garfield and Peter Finch and Natalie Portman a Jean Peters with a college degree. I saw the film twice in a row, I hadn't done that in years. Not since ""Drugstore Cowboy"", ""Apartment Zero"" and ""Sex Lies and Videotape"" The unfolding of the dark happens in front of our eyes and it feels chillingly familiar. Lies we tell each other with so much conviction with so much honesty. The only real thing is the pain and the loneliness. It doesn't sound like a very entertaining night out but believe me, it is. Go, see for yourself. You may have to confront something you didn't want to confront. That's part of the process call growing up. Who's afraid of that?",/review/rw1204224/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2004,rdekoch,1," Far, Far Away: America Loves Delusion
","I won't reveal what ultimately happens in Closer but I will confess that I was disappointed that it didn't end with a fiery double-decker bus crash that left no survivors. This film would have been stale 20 years ago, but it's completely ridiculous now. The ""truths"" about relationships that the movie attempts to reveal are just nuggets of stereotypical nonsense that you could see in a TV movie(Men thrive on conquest and dominance, Women can't resist being treated like whores, etc.). The film, like it's characters is shallow and dishonest underneath the pretty exterior.",/review/rw1204224/?ref_=tt_urv

4 November 2009,Lechuguilla,2," Oh What Wretched Characters
","Unnecessarily tangled romantic relationships among four beautiful people in modern London form the core of this Mike Nichols directed film, based on a play. About the only thing I liked here was the melancholy song ""The Blower's Daughter"", sung by Damien Rice, that opens the film. The film's script is wretched.",/review/rw1204224/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2004,pic23ent,10," Closer to reality...
","This is the most honest film I've ever seen. Although I'm sure there are critics out there who will comment on the explicit language rather than the story, anyone who's ever been in a dysfunctional relationship can relate to at least some part of this film. I for one found it a very personal and shockingly accurate depiction of how human beings use love and sex to unintentionally destroy each other. The performances were magnificent from all angles. Mike Nichols has done it again. This film is ""Carnal Knowledge"" for the new millennium. If the Academy does not recognize ""Closer"" as a Best Picture candidate, then the Academy should no longer be recognized as the authority on achievement in film... yes, it's that good.",/review/rw1204224/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2006,Quinoa1984,7," the acting, writing, and direction are creative, skilled, cold as ice picks
","Closer is a British-American relationship drama about people that really are not too likable, but that it is part of what might be a kind of working thesis for the film should be taken into account. The four principles- Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen- are like amalgamations of all of the lesser characteristics of those in post-modern relationship plays and films, where the love and goodness in them is subdued under their lack of connections to one another. That it all doesn't work as well as, for prime example, Nichol's own Carnal Knowledge, may be because of the script more than anything. What is successful from Marber's work- of showing four characters who find what they are looking for, then go into complete and utter disillusionment- it really has to walk a fine line of having these people talking truthfully, honestly not just in the context of their characters but how MOST people do talk in relationships. Sometimes its quite believable, and sometimes not, and when it's not the script lends itself more to the basis of 'hip' language, like Kevin Smith if he substituted pop-culture references for rough innuendo and hurt. It's a hit or miss script from a play that may or may not have been better for the stage where it's necessarily a dialog-driven medium. And because of the time lapses and twists and turns given to the characters over the course of however many years pass in the film, it's as much worth to do for the filmmakers as it is a possible liability.",/review/rw1204224/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2005,OverAnalysisBoy,8," Flawed and cold, but sharp and haunting.
","I've seen Closer described as a cinematic triumph, but it's precisely not. The film wears its theatrical origins on its sleeve, and the presence of the camera is mostly irrelevant.",/review/rw1204224/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2020,Kirpianuscus,," long time...
","It is one of film who, for long time, I refused to see it. The cast was the main reason - so impressive than the dissapointment is prepared from start. After I saw it, except the webb of relations, the remarkable performance of Natalie Portman remain the most important memory. A film about love and revenge and men more about women and dark games and pure fury. Great for the storms discovered in yourself after final credits.",/review/rw1204224/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2006,BA_Harrison,4," I guess depressing drama just isn't my thing.
","Lent to me by a friend who has got this major thing for Ms. Portman, Closer is indeed compulsory viewing for all fans of the pretty little minx; after all, it's probably the closest you'll get to seeing Queen Amidala in her undies, without trawling the internet for candid paparazzi shots of her on the beach.",/review/rw1204224/?ref_=tt_urv
