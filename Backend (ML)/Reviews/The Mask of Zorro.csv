2 February 2006,ccthemovieman-1,8," Know What You're In For Before You See This
","Boy, did this movie disappoint a lot of people.....but not me. The ""disappointed"" were the Adam Sandler fans who expected another ""Happy Gilmore""-type character, the kind of goofball the comedian has built a career on portraying. Instead, they got a dark comedy/drama that was anything but the typical Sandler fare. They also got a weird story.",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2004,FilmOtaku,8," A slight departure from P.T. Anderson's `usual'
","Being a big fan of P.T. Anderson's work since I saw `Boogie Nights' (about 3 times in one week at the theater) years ago, I anxiously awaited the release of his latest film.  Then I heard it starred Adam Sandler, who is one of my least favorite actors of all time, but even then I figured that if anyone is going to make me not want to start throwing things at Sandler's image, it would be Anderson.  After all, he got me to respect Tom Cruise after seeing `Magnolia'.  When I finally got to see the film this past weekend (after wanting to see the film for about a year) I wasn't disappointed, and I found that my trust was not misplaced.  Anderson took Sandler and turned him into a sad sack who is so psychologically screwed up he would be an analyst's dream.  Emily Watson is his perfect counterpart as a classy yet extremely quirky love interest.  ",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2003,Senator_Corleone,10," PTA unlocks Sandler with a brilliant film
","We've come to expect a lot from Paul Thomas Anderson. After his twin masterpieces ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"", not to mention the sure-handed and satisfying ""Hard Eight"", we knew he was a filmmaker of skill and magic. So when it was announced that the next PTA film would be a 90-minute romantic comedy starring (Gasp!) Adam Sandler, I was, for one, not worried. This man had taken Mark Wahlberg and turned him into someone we could be proud to watch onscreen. He cast icon Tom Cruise, gave him the character of Frank ""T.J."" Mackey, and directed the actor to one of the most repulsive, offensive, and inspired performances of the ""Top Gun"" star's career. So, I was pretty confident in his ability to handle the star of ""Little Nicky"". But, boy, I still wasn't prepared for what I saw. Sandler just wasn't good, he was INCREDIBLE. I couldn't believe my eyes-here was the man behind ""Eight Crazy Nights"" creating a completely realized, utterly human character with a studied, nuanced performance. Many have commented on the fact that Barry Egan, Sandler's character, is not that different from his previous incarnations. Socially akward and prone to explosive violence, Barry might just be the key to explainging Sandler's Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore. The character helps shine a light on the inner torment of those man-children.",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," Wonderful film and a contender for Sandler's best performance
","I am not a big Adam Sandler fan, but I watched Punch-Drunk Love because I had heard nothing but good things about it. I was expecting a good movie, but not one this wonderful. It is a beautifully filmed movie, the score is gorgeous and just adds to the scene especially in the romantic parts, the black humour is very funny and some parts are genuinely touching. The script is funny, poignant, thoughtful and clever and the story is always interesting. The acting is much better than I anticipated. I knew Phillip Seymour Hoffmann was going to be brilliant, as he nearly always is, and he is, and Emily Watson is both believable and beguiling. The most pleasant surprise is Sandler, as I've said I am not a fan, he has done some stuff I like but I can find him irritating. Here though, his performance has moments when it is quirky but mostly it is beautiful and understated, not only is Punch-Drunk Love Sandler's best film in my opinion but alongside Reign Over Me it is a contender for his best performance. In conclusion, just wonderful. 10/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2002,bam9,10," Biggest surprise of the year - an Adam Sandler art film
","I caught this at the New York film festival and my expectations were about as low as they could be. I was never a huge Adam Sandler fan, and I hadn't ever taken a liking to PT Anderson's other films. I thought that Magnolia was pretty flimsy writing-wise, and I also thought that it got way too much undue attention when it came out.",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2005,moviemanMA,10," A New Side of Sandler
","Adam Sandler is known for his wacky, flaky, and sometimes over the top style of comedy. With films like Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy under his belt, one would think that he would stick with what he's got. Sandler has shown us a new side of him with his performance in Paul Thomas Anderson's Punch Drunk Love.",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2005,jcdugger,8," This movie is all LOVE!

24 April 2004,rbverhoef,6," Sandler is terrific
","One of the reasons I would recommend 'Punch-Drunk Love' is Adam Sandler. For the first time he is the best thing in a movie and I must admit he does a tremendous job with his character, named Barry Egan. He has the same aggressive outbursts he has in his comedies but here they fit his character and the story. He seems like a pretty normal guy although you see something in his face, something ready to come out, and when it comes you can almost understand it.",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2012,planktonrules,6," A bit confusing and odd....
","""Punch-Drunk Love"" is NOT a movie that most Adam Sandler fans can relate to because it's really not a comedy. However, unlike ""Reign Over Me"" (which was fantastic), this film does not have a traditional narrative. In many ways, it's like a hunk out of someone's life--both good, bad and mundane. It's really a film for particular people with particular tastes. After having seen it, I am not exactly sure WHAT I thought of the film or whether I'd recommend it or not.",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2020,niels2765,10," My favourite film of all time!
","Adam Sandler takes a break from his usual slapstick & simplistic comedic roles and instead goes for a more serious role. The film is a slow and intricate character study of a psychologically troubled Barry Egan, who is played by Adam Sandler. Adam Sandler does an exceptional job portraying an emotionally volatile yet charming character, who has so much emotional depth. Emily Watson also does a phenomenal job playing Lena Leonard, Barry Egan's love interest. An awkward romantic, Lena Leonard combats Barry's emotional issues, and slowly become's romantically involved with Barry. The on-screen chemistry between Emily Watson & Adam Sandler is indisputable.",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2016,sharky_55,5," I'm a dentist.
","There is a scene in Punch Drunk Love of such perfectly whipped up chaos. A first meeting with a potential blind date has gone amiss, and both parties are presumably disappointed. And then Lena, played by Emily Watson with such wide, trusting eyes, hesitates at her car, much like Sandler does the same at the door to the party, and resolves to make that long walk back and ask him out. But that is not all that is going on; the phone sex line is bugging him again for money, and slapstick type accidents are happening in the work environment in the background. Anderson visualises Barry's anxiety on screen - it would have been easy to let the acting portray it, as when he smashes up the bathroom. But here it burrows into our minds too. The upbeat, percussive soundtrack grows louder and louder until it almost drowns out the dialogue. The prying, inquisitive Elizabeth's speech gets quicker, more nagging. The characters walk faster. The edits sharply cut away from the accidents, as if Barry was forceful pushing them to the back of his mind. It is not an easy thing for him to do.",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv

26 January 2013,rooprect,9," Punch Drunk Love is a knockout!
","I was never a big Adam Sandler fan, nor did I enjoy director Paul Thomas Anderson's prior hit ""Magnolia"" as much as critics raved. So I popped this movie in expecting no more than something to kill 90 mins or so.",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2020,thedarkhorizon,7," Perky, cringy, rough, sweet, honest, beautiful. Surprising movie!
","A wonderful delightful movie, I was glued to the screen from the beginning to the end. Perky, sweet, honest, rough, weird, cringy, beautiful. Sandler's performance surprised me many times and in the film lie many hidden truths about life, love, passion and what it means to be(come) a happy person.",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2003,IsakBodin,10," The stuff dreams are made of.
","I saw Punch Drunk Love at the Gothenburg film festival today and I was totally overwhelmed by it. I had really looked forward to it since I love Paul Thomas Anderson's earlier films. Magnolia is still among my top five favourite movies ever and my expectations were therefore almost too high. I must admit I was sceptical of Adam Sandler playing a serious part. But he makes fantastic interpretation of his character Barry Egan, a small business owner pushed around by his seven (!) sisters  who's miserable life takes a turn when he meets love in Emily Watson's character. Watson makes a beautiful portrait of the mysterious and lonely Lena who falls in love with Barry.",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2006,Dan1863Sickles,1," Adam Sandler's Unique Screen Persona -- The Whining Bully
","Charlie Chaplin was the Little Tramp. Kicked around and mistreated, he always retained his hope, his kindness and his jaunty walk. Adam Sandler has taken the comic little man persona in an entirely new direction -- he's the sniveling tough guy, the twitchy mama's boy, the whining bully.",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2020,VallejoDiego,10," Sandlers best performance
","My first time watching this. Wanted to watch another great Sandler performance everyone talked about besides Uncut Gems. And I liked him even more this movie! Paul Thomas Andersons' direction is beautiful. Shots are on point and score gives me anxiety. Which is what I believe Sandlers character has, social anxiety. I also love how it has aittle bit of everything. Romance, comedy, drama, and a little bit of thriller.",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2007,Benedict_Cumberbatch,," Love & Pudding
","The first time I saw ""Punch-Drunk Love"" I was a little bit disappointed, mostly because it's Paul Thomas Anderson's follow-up to ""Magnolia"", my favourite film ever, so I had high expectations (it also didn't help it was about 2 A.M. and I was quite sleepy and moody). I've just had a second viewing and I'm totally in love with this film. Anderson himself said he doesn't think he'll ever do anything as great as ""Magnolia"" again and I agree, I don't think he can get any better than his perfect work of art called ""Magnolia"", a truly unique film experience that has it all. Anderson reached the peak quite early in his career. That doesn't mean, though, that he can't continue making other fine films (go away, Orson Welles syndrome!), and ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is the 4th of them. One of the most original love stories of the decade (perhaps, ever), the story of the depressed and insecure Barry Egan (Adam Sandler, in his only real performance to date - I wish he could work with PTA again) and Lena Leonard (Emily Watson and her big, lovely blue eyes) rings true to anyone who ever fell in love and felt dizzy, goofy...and a little scared, too. ""Punch-Drunk Love"" succeeds wonderfully at showing us how bizarre and precious being in love is. If you liked ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", you'll probably enjoy PDL as well.",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2006,ptb-8,1," the 'yellow submarine' of movies.
","A music industry urban legend has it that The Beatles wrote their song Yellow Submarine as a joke: a childish nursery rhyme of stupefying repetition with a brass band pounding away, like 'London Bridge Is Falling Down"" set to Monty Python music; and they did this just to see if they could release any old trash, basic and ridiculous, to see if the public would lap it up, to see if the crits would make art of it, and to simply see what ridiculous nothingness they could foist on the world... like the emperor's new clothes. Well PUNCH DRUNK LOVE is the movie equivalent of that arrogant rude and insulting Beatles act. Gus Van Sant tried it with the boring 'drama' GERRY' and got caught again after his PSYCHO remake. But PUNCH DRUNK LOVE is as perfectly useless and silly and pointless and as massive a hoax as is Yellow Submarine. You know how the Anglo west roars with astonishment at the French clasping Jerry Lewis cinematic durges like THE PATSY? Try the utterly ridiculous notion that Sandler is somehow some Chaplinesque everyman? Need I go on? Your clue to your experience of PUNCH DRUNK LOVE is spelled out there in the first two words of the title.",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2020,cardsrock,8," Sandler showcases his range
","I wish Adam Sandler would do more dramatic roles because he really is a good actor. He's terrific here and carries most of the film based on his layered, multi-faceted performance. The film is PTA doing what PTA does, putting his unique spin the overdone rom-com formula. This definitely is the most arthouse-y rom-com I've ever seen. It's often bizarre and weird, but also touching and inventive. It's not immediately accessible, but it ultimately wins you over. Punch-Drunk Love is an odd gem in the vast library of romantic comedies.",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2017,ericventura,10," Overlooked, Under-Watched, and Underrated
","The best Adam Sandler movie ever. Period. This film shows a depth that I never thought Sandler could achieve. It shows a hidden acting talent that is obscured by his toothy, stupid Adam Sandler character of every other movie he has ever been in. The director of actors, Paul Thomas Anderson, brought this out from Sandler in an extremely personal and personable film. To put it simply, for Anderson, Barry Egan represents the eccentricity of himself and for everybody; he represents the difficulties, struggles, and awkwardness in everyday life.",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2020,garethcrook,8," Sandler's best film (with little competition)
","I like Paul Thomas Anderson films, mostly. I hate Adam Sandler films, unequivocally. Even his latest 'Uncut Gems', although I kinda enjoyed, I also hated. This though, is supposed to be the exception. To cut to the chase, it is. I'm not sure it's as much to do with Sandler as it is with PTA, who's not afraid of the quirky and unusual... and this is both. Sandler plays Barry, a socially awkward hardware salesman. An only son with 7 sisters, big family, lots of pressure. Single and confused. I have to give him some credit, he captures Barry's insecurities very well. You feel for Barry, he's lonely, anxious, trying to do his best. His teasing sisters, Georgia from the phone sex service hassling him, Barry has a lot on his mind. Add to that the driving music high in the mix and scenes that build with the intensity of a runaway jackhammer and it gets pretty tense. I'm enjoying it, then Dean (Philip Seymour Hoffman) turns up and it goes from good to great. Just as things seem to be getting better for Barry when he meets Lena (Emily Watson) and goes on a date, Dean's henchmen come to ruin him. Dean you see is behind the phone sex scam, ""we know where you live"", ""we'll expose you"" and Barry's in a tailspin. Barry however has a plan to escape to Hawaii, with the help of some chocolate puddings and some extreme couponing. I know that sounds nuts, but Barry is a little. He's frenetic, prone to punching walls, occasionally finds solace in an old harmonium he found out on the street and is enthralling to watch. As Barry's confidence grows, so does his impulsiveness, this not only helps his love life, but fuels his desire to right the wrongs of Dean in true get the girl, kill the baddies style. I will still do my best to avoid Sandler movies, but this, I have to confess is rather magical.",/review/rw5711853/?ref_=tt_urv
