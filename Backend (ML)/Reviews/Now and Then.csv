28 August 2022,t-ktinney,3," Why Did I Watch The Whole Series?
",Image a 7 hour long Lifetime movie about 2 mentally messed up twins- one worse than the other and there you have the premise of the 7 part series.,/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,miaharpr,6," On the fence
","On the one hand, I understand the negative reviews; it had a messy start, a convoluted plot, some holes in the story, and an ending that could leave a lot of viewers dissatisfied, not to mention vapid to hammed up acting from the supporting cast. On the other hand, I can appreciate what the show wanted to be. I'll also be the minority and say that Michelle Monaghan played a difficult role and despite a shaky start, she gradually was able to immerse herself into her characters and give a complex performance (again, I'm the minority on this). Indeed, the show felt like a Lifetime production. It didn't seem to have a high budget, and it's most evident in the last episode, where the special effects were used with the faintest subtlety...I overall thought it was an easy watch, cringy at times, but I got through it-I am an Echoes survivor...and I closet-enjoyed the show.",/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,Otte1,4," Just unbelievable....
","The direction was done incorrectly. With all the flashbacks it was very very hard to determine what was happening today and what was flashback. It was very distracting when there was a scene having to decipher. But the worst crime, just not believable. So many things could be cleared up with a phone call, one statement, one question, or anything. The story depends on everyone being dumb all the time for the series to work. The timelines were completely off. And again, everyone has to be stupid. Combined that with an confusing ending and this is not worth your time.",/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2022,lawsonlynn,8," Loved this
","I am getting a bit tired of reviews which begin with, ""too complicated"" or ""lost me."" Are we really becoming so lazy & impatient that we can't handle the occasional narrative challenge? ""Not realistic"" or ""believable"" is another common critique. Really? Because (news flash) no movie or series is ""real."" Isn't that the point? That we watch these things to escape reality & to be entertained.",/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2022,emmabmurphy,6," Good idea but sketchy in places
",The idea is cool but there's a few things that just don't sit right or needed more development.,/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2022,maryskywalker11,7," Better than reviews say
","I'm kinda surprised by all of the negative reviews after finishing this show! I really enjoyed it and was quickly sucked into the story. The summary and trailer intrigued me so I'm glad I decided to watch despite the low rating. Perfect? No. Confusing? Yes, but also engaging and with enough twists to keep me watching.",/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2022,linda-plant2,2," SO MUCH WHISPERING
","I did so much fast forwarding on this load of tripe. Stock phrases of ""tell me the truth"" ""I will fix this"" ""whats going on"" ""I'm sorry I have to go""",/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2022,gordypix,3," Not good...
",Why is Netflix running this sort of nonsense? 7 episodes of drivel to get to an ending that is so implausible it makes daytime soap operas look like Mastermind.,/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,calocamilla,5," Perfect show to clean your house
","It's bad but watchable while doing other stuff, like cleaning your house or other boring chores.",/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,kbaxws,5," Could have been better
","I like Michelle Monaghan, so decided to try.",/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,mercyaintfree,5," WAS looking pretty good .....
",As the story evolved through the first 3 episodes you could fully grasp what it was turning into. Two twin women trading positions in each other's lives sometimes for extended periods of time.,/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,snuggybearkids,3," Is like a vacuum
","Both sucks and blows. I've never seen lamer writing and over acting. As predictable as Saturday comes after Friday. Plot holes, storyline that might have had potential but crossed the insipid line. Another Crapflix disappointment.",/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,umimelectric,6," The definition of hit or miss
","There's good & bad elements to this show, with a very smart although convoluted twist/misdirect standing out as a huge positive that nearly counteracts the sometimes inexcusable acting, over-the-top drama, and unrealistic plot turns. Overall, being only 7 episodes, I would recommend it for someone who has Netflix and is looking for something to get into requiring minimal commitment. It is a good thing it isn't any longer of a series though, because this show would definitely prove that too much can be a very bad thing. 6/10; an intriguing mystery that is weighed down by being a little too heavy handed.",/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2022,buffgirl73-265-696226,6," I had to finish it...But
",Overly complicated in the first couple of episodes but I was in it for the duration by then so completed it.,/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,runeholmjensen,7," Worth a watch.
","Not as bad as the other reviews say. Is it perfect? No absolutely not, but it's worth a watch. Few nice twistes in it. It's not impossible to follow as some say - maybe don't sit on your phone doing other stuff while watching a show and then complaining it's difficult to follow.",/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2022,madmaywebdesign,10," Good story
","I don't know what all the reviews about it being confusing are all about. It's not hard to follow at all. Maybe they are multitasking and if that is case, don't write a review. The acting is great, the story is full of twists and not predictable. I binge the whole season, I definitely recommend watching!",/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2022,joanamarah,6," Not the best but not the worst
",Wasn't horrendous like some reviews are making out but it could have flowed better. It's not realistic by any means as most identical twins do have something that distinguishes them apart so it doesn't make sense that only one person noticed throughout the years they were switching. Lenny was a little annoying and Jack was too.,/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,rocky-31943,9," Solid thriller
",This was a great binge series. I felt the plot was compelling and keep me and my partner engaged the whole time.,/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,punchline9,9," Confusing at times
","Confusing at times as most lives around twins must be but this series was still quite good. Monaghan is a great actress and plays the subtle differences in both women well, but the star of the show for me was the sheriff played by Karen Robinson. Binged all 7 episodes in one day as it went by quickly, holding my interest throughout. I fully recommend it.",/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2022,snowyprecipice,6," Confusing and draggy
","I give it a 6 because the acting is pretty good, and the setting/ cinematography is nice. But the plot? It was a bit of a mess and hard to follow, especially at the start. It's like a decent Lifetime movie, a little cheesy and a little weird. I found myself forwarding towards the end. The twists were just too unrealistic. It might have been better if they showed more of their childhood and why Leni is the way she is, instead of portraying her as this manipulative character who was tough to sympathise for.",/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,bret-bannerman,2," Wow
","So bad, I can't even. How did they get all these great actors to be part of this horrid crap? People are mentioning Lifetime...HAA, not even Lifetime would have aired this. Matt Bomer...this is a career killer. Michelle whoever Leni, Gina, baaa Vanessa Gazy (should be Crazy) screwed you.",/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,Headturner1,2," Awful
","Seriously! I know you shouldn't review a series until you've watched at least a few episodes but what if you can't get through 20 minutes of one?!? Lifetime movies are better. From the kitschy music, the way it's shot. Even Franco Rivera( Rescue me) is awful! He delivers his lines so swiftly and urgent like it just comes across as completely unbelievable. The scene where she goes home, the parts she narrates as she writes to the sister, all awful! Netflix use to have some decent series but now maybe one out of 10 is watchable. To bad..",/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,rosemaryandthyme,5," Gina, Gina, Gina
","The first two episodes were OK although the story was hokey, but it spiralled at the third episode and I gave up after the fourth. Lena became annoying and in a constant state of stress ...""Gina, Gina, Gina"" and was just a selfish person i.e shouting at sick father, no relationship with other sibling, talking in her phone whilst driving and showed no help or concern for the beaten up Grandma - just Gina, Gina, Gina. Also, who was the real mother because neither showed much love or concern for the daughter. Wooden characters except for the Sheriff who deserves her own series.",/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,Ripshin,," In a word, ""Lifetime""
","Yep, Netflix is stooping to that. But, hey, it's in the top ten today.",/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,emppark,7," Worth a watch
","I always stop by the reviews if I start watching something and it's a bit meh, as if they're dire I normally give up, BUT for some reason I persevered on this one and it's by no means as bad as some of the reviews make out. It's not what I would call a ""thriller"" but there's enough twists to keep you interested and make it past some questionable acting.",/review/rw8472741/?ref_=tt_urv
