10 January 2019,asphyxion_,8," Genuinely funny and it never victimizes its main character
","Speechless has a ton of heart and the family under the monarchy of Minnie Driver has a feelgood chemistry. I don't think her British origin has ever actually been explained in the show (that I can recall), so it's somewhat offputting at first getting adjusted to an all American family with the matriarch being the lone Brit. It's not a common situation in a domestic sitcom, but neither is much else common about Speechless. From the lead character JJ DiMeo suffering from Cerebral Palsy and his silky-voiced partner Kenneth to their quirky dog Pepper, the entire main cast shines through--each member offering their own form of delivery (deadpan, self-deprecating, etc)--giving the viewer a buffet of all the different shades of comedy available. It's also refreshing that there's no canned laughter--ABC's better comedies tend to share that trait.",/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2021,ten-thousand-marbles,7," A cut above the usual family sitcom
",It's unfortunate this show only went three seasons. It seemed that season three was where they were just starting to hit their stride. The cast had come together nicely and the writing had a little more edge than the previous years. The entire series is entertaining and fun. Definitely worth a watch.,/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2016,Dr_Sagan,," Another SitCom based on a ""unique"" family but this is generally funny!
","This a new situation comedy about a ""unique"" family, a couple and 3 teenage kids, one of them is on a wheelchair using specialized equipment to communicate (like Stephen Hawking minus the electronic voice) because of cerebral palsy.",/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2016,lisacarlson,10," Perfection!
","Speechless simply put is perfection. Actress, singer songwriter Minnie Driver delivers what we all want to say but usually do not as the Mom. She's surrounded by a cast who shines right along with her. For anyone who felt unhinged growing up this show is for you; it's a great commentary on the things we do not normally see in a comedy. Nothing is perfect here and ins't that spectacular. Kinda like the way most of us live. The 30 minute length gives us just enough to look forward to more and Wednesday night is a perfect place for it. I hope the series creator, producer and writer Scott Silveri continues to elevate this show with great writing.",/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2017,byson5186,10," J.J. Is A Firework
","Prime Time T.V. shows coming out try to be funny and original. This T.V. show is both, and it shows us how awesome and normal a kid with disabilities can be!! My title is an allusion to Katy Perry's song Firework. You'll feel that same way about J.J.",/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2019,WulfieGirl,10," Has Yet to Disappoint
","Season 2 is almost over and this show continues to deliver. Speechless masterfully takes a difficult and potentially isolating health issue and shows the world stubborn love, camaraderie and strength all while making you smile. The characters all have their own ""extreme"" traits - Maya's brazen outlook for one - and it works beautifully in this hilarious symphony of a family supporting each other no matter what comes their way. Also, I'd be remiss not to mention the amazing job JJ's character does at reminding the world that there's so much more to a person than what you see. This show is first class. For anyone that likes to laugh, Speechless is a must see.",/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2016,rako-27616,10," The representation was amazing!
","I honestly can't remember the last time I saw a show where the main character was a wheelchair user played by an actor who actually uses a wheelchair. This alone makes the show a must-see. Admittedly there are the typical ABC-sitcom tropes: the corniness, the less-than-ideal acting, etc. But it's all worth it to see the way they tackle disabilities with an actor who experiences everything first-hand. As a viewer in a wheelchair, it was genuinely incredible. I cannot wait to see where the show goes in the future. I hope that this is one that sticks. If you don't care about it, chances are that you have never been disabled or affected by someone with a disability. (Which is disappointing as the messages in the show are aimed at you.) And if you are disabled, I would definitely recommend checking it out.",/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2016,nillennir,," Hilarious
","I have to say, some parts are over actuated in my opinion; but the situations are hilarious. I like that Micah Fowler have the same discapacity than in the series (but a minor degree) as like it was presented in the series switched at birth. Also any one with some degree of discapacity will find identificated with the situations in the comedy (i do). I lived a lot of the scenes in the chapter (for example get stop by the police -not doing anything wrong-, asked to get down of the car and when they see me i have no legs they just let me go. I hope you enjoy the show and like my review I can't rate it but i give it a 9/10.",/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2016,cherold,8," Funniest sitcom of the season; Minnie Driver is terrific
","This terrifically funny sitcom has a rather odd structure. It's similar to shows like Fresh Off the Boat and the Real O'Neals, except that since the character the series is built around can't speak, his brother fills the role of POV character. ",/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv

",It's the tight knit DiMeo family. Maya (Minnie Driver) is the tiger mother protecting her disabled son JJ. Jimmy is the easy going father. Ray is the awkward middle child. Dylan is the fiery youngest child. They hire Kenneth Clements as JJ's aide.,/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2016,jperry714,9," Something different
","This show, seems to be, something different from the usual sitcom fare. So I am going to try something different in this review. I am going to give my opinion and not present it as undeniable fact. I won't say that the show is funny, but I will admit that I found it funny. I personally enjoyed it more than the Goldbergs, though I do watch that show regularly and for the most part enjoy it. I missed the pilot of Speechless and base this opinion on the second episode. I found the acting to be fine, even the children. All of the kids made me laugh at one point or another. I think the actor cast as the new aid is perfect and shows a real chemistry with the special needs son he is charged with assisting. I understand that there will be negative reviews for just about any show, I just recommend you use them for what they are. Some stranger's opinion who, if you read them, seems to think that their opinion is fact. And if someone really thinks that if they don't laugh, then it's not funny period, then they don't understand what a sense of humor is.",/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2019,emutown,8," So good
","This show never ceases to amaze me. Every episode I'm laughing, and aw'ing right along with them. All of the characters are great. The writers are insanely creative, and never leave a boring or dull moment. Not only all of these things, but this show is so very important in our world. Inclusion. Acceptance. Equality. Fighting for what's right. Enjoying the ride eventheough the struggles. It's all just so brilliant. Mad props to everyone involved, and I hope this show lasts a long time!",/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2016,ljsdogs,10," I love this show.
","I just watched the first show and i love it. I don't usually get excited over new shows, can't remember the last new show i really liked. I hope this stays on for a long time. It usually takes a few episodes for the characters to click , but this is already clicking. Love all the people and their parts, very well done. Funny, charming. Went to the top of my must see list. Someone did something right with the casting and writing..good job !!will be telling my friends about it. Hope others like it as much as I do..I don't want to see this show get canceled. Hope the network gets the message and treats this gem with care and respect. We need more shows like this and I wouldn't be watching old movies on Roku.",/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2017,cherrypepsi-41385,9," the start to the new season is hilarious and heartfelt
",I have been waiting for the season premiere of this show for months and It didn't disappoint I laughed out loud I smiled I felt like part of the family just like in the first season this is really shaping up to be another hilarious season full of laughs and fun with the demaos you just cant get enough of them if you start watching them your for sure gonna want more no doubt about it,/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv

27 October 2016,MovieHoliks,6," Took Me A Few Eps To Like This Show...
","I watched the pilot and maybe second show of this, and lost interest. Then my sister asks me if I've been watching this show, and tells me how much she likes it, so I go back and start watching again, and I'll tell ya, this show is growing on me. I guess I never really thought of Minnie Driver being a sitcom-y actress, but she somehow works here. And the dude with the speech impediment from ""Big Bang Theory"" (John Ross Bowie) plays her hubbie (minus the speech impediment LOL. Cedric Yarbrough is playing some kind of in-house caregiver to their special needs child, and the two develop a relationship where they sorta use each other to their own benefit. LOL I dunno where this show is going, but I think I'll keep watching for now. Still not up to the quality of the other ABC favs, ""The Middle"" (which has moved to Tuesday nites), ""Goldbergs"" and ""Modern Family"", but this definitely has potential...",/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv

21 September 2016,bjarias,6," .. yes six.. and that's being very kind
","..there are good actors in this production that are much better than this sub-par effort deserves. That's not to say it will not succeed, for God only knows, many even lesser efforts have repeatedly kept going. If you can get through the first ten minutes and cannot find fault, than there's not much else to say. The saying 'it takes all kinds' is no more true than in entertainment programming.. one man's joy is another's poison. Trying to fill ten lines when you've pretty much said all you had wanted to say is the most demanding challenge when writing about these kinds of programs. You can only say so much, and you keep questioning why you are attempting to write anything at all.",/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2018,tchristos-36619,9," Finally something funny!!!

23 September 2016,jordan2240,2," Do NOT ignore the negative reviews
","Minnie Driver must be a dog lover, because she keeps appearing in them. Watched this only because it was sandwiched between 2 of my favorite sitcoms (Goldbergs and Modern Family), but I don't think even that will save it. I appreciate that they are trying to appeal to an audience that few shows go after, but this thing is pitiful. I couldn't even muster a smile at any of it, though admittedly I only made it through the first 15 minutes. It reminds me of the last vehicle Robin Williams was part of, at least in terms of the complete lack of humor even though the cast tried like the dickens to make it funny. I suspect this show won't make it through a full season, which makes me feel bad for those who are associated with it, because I think they are trying to do something different and good. Better luck next time.",/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show is awesome. I just binge watched all three seasons and love it. I also started to get hooked on punk because of John Bowie. I didn't know that he is a Ramones junkie in real life and just happen to listen to the podcast he did about them.

13 April 2017,khayreelanden,8," The show is funny but Ray is bashed throughout.
","The show is hilarious with touching moments and well written characters. My only issues are concerning all the negativity towards Ray (who seems to be the saddest, unluckiest kid on Earth). At least give the boy one lucky day it's becoming annoying. Yet he solves majority of the family conflicts. Also the mother is always overbearing towards JJ which is brilliant and cringing at the same time. She can be beautifully loving and tenaciously wicked in an instant. JJ and Kenneth are hilarious together. The father and Dylan are also an hilarious duo.",/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2016,judyjeankwon,3," couldn't get past first 5
","The show felt really unbelievable. I know ""cynical"" is the new cool and style of shows but it was really contrived and disingenuous. I couldn't believe any of the characters. Everyone looked and felt like they were saying and acting the parts. I believe Cynic comes from a real place of pain and they all seemed like they had happy and easy lives. It felt Disney trying to be Amazon, HBO... The show also looked like it was shot in LA but they did a good job making everyone ""white"" east coast, middle-class, wonder bread and so boring. The whole show revolves around a family putting the special needs kid as the most important thing in their life, as well as the town accepting the disabled kid without much trials. I guess the problem starts with the concept because that in itself doesn't seem believable to me. Moving a whole family around with middle-school aged kids constantly, ruining their chance at going to college anda chance at a decent life for one special needs kid. Hmmm.",/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2016,ftlauderdalefilmfan,10," This show has great potential!
","While the creating team of this new program packed an awful lot into the very first episode, I don't remember ever seeing a show that not only had me hooked within the first ten minutes the way this one did, but had me loving it more and more as it progressed and evolved. Admittedly many of the characters outside of the family, especially those in the school, were way over the top in the way they treated, mistreated, or mostly over-compensated for the ""disabled"" new kid (the teacher's and students' welcome when he first enters the classroom?), his reactions to all of them were hilarious. And Dina Spybey-Waters, whose character was crazy enough years ago in ""Six Feet Under,"" was just as hilarious as his ""voice."" As others have stated on the message boards, all this kid wants is to be treated like anyone else. Not to mention he is witty and sarcastic as all get out.",/review/rw3550937/?ref_=tt_urv
