27 September 2004,Coventry,7," Go Team Slapstick!
","Once every few years, you're presented to a slapstick comedy so hilarious you instantly forget how LOW this form of entertainment actually is. I can't give a scientific explanation to state how come it's funny to see someone (preferably wearing glasses) getting hit in the face by a ballit just is. Dodgeball is vulgar, crude and without substancebut your stomach will hurt from laughing and don't we all need that from time to time? In case you really want to defend this film, you can always say it features tons of unsubtle criticism towards modern American image of exaggerated health-obsession. Ben Stiller's character is the personification of the obnoxious fitness guru: 'We're better than you, and we know it'. Opposed to him, there's Vince Vaughn as the chilled-minded, lovable guy who owns a fitness center for the underdeveloped wimps. Due to his financial situation, he risks losing his gym to Stiller except if he and his teams of misfits manage to win the world-famous dodgeball tournament. The film is a series of cheap chuckles, eccentric characters and outrageous one-liners. It's pretty funny to hear Stiller yell out lines like: 'You're a skid mark on the underpants of society'. Or the always-amusing Rip Torn encouraging his team with the words: 'you're as useful as a cock-flavored lollipop'. The acting is great as it can be with Ben Stiller and Rip Torn who go delightfully over the top and lots of enthusiast cameos (Chuck Norris, David Hasselhof, William Shatner and even Lance Armstrong). It sure isn't Schindler's List but Dodgball is great entertainment and stress releasing.",/review/rw0921659/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2005,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," Like chocolate cake: you know it's bad for you, but you can't help but love it
","Silly metaphor, I know. The film ""Dodgeball: A true underdog story"" while maybe be offensive at times, the film really brings it back up to place with the humor. You really can't help but laugh at the movie a couple times. Sort of like ""Zoolander"", another great flick with Ben Stiller, it's so stupid you've gotta love it. I would recommend this film for a good laugh. As of movie of the year or comedy of the year, no, this is not the film. But it was a good one to watch. A true film for any Ben Stiller fan, that's for sure. I will warn though, if you get offended easily, this maybe not the film for you.",/review/rw0921659/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2004,Chris_Docker,7," superior slapstick comedy - tightly scripted, it gets immense mileage out of the flimsiest of gags
","Go and see it. It's one of the best comedies of the year and a lot funnier than it should be given the flimsy premise. Ben Stiller has a big 'Globo' health club worth millions (it even includes cosmetic surgery facilities - they know that 'fatness is genetic, like baldness or necrophilia'). The lovely Christine Taylor is his lawyer, charged with getting rid of the 'Average Joe' gym across the road so they can build a parking lot for Globo customers. She takes a liking to the 'underdog' owner of the Average Joe gym though, and helps them in their plan to win a Dodgeball contest in order to get the money they owe. Dodgeball is an 'obscure' sport that mostly consists of throwing a ball to hit your opponent (look it up on the Net - Dodgeball fans take it quite seriously!) Even when I describe the film, I think 'it sounds awful' - I probably would have avoided it if it hadn't been recommended so highly - and I recommend you stay till the *very end* of the credits for one of the best scenes (which also takes a swipe at the US film-making industry!)",/review/rw0921659/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2008,g-bodyl,10," If you can dodge a wrench.....
","This film is one of the funniest slapstick comedy ever. Ben Stiller was funny as always and Vince Vaughn was surprisingly funny. Stiller plays White Goodman and he is the snobbish owner of his up-to-the-style Globo Gym whereas Vaughn plays Peter La Fleur and he is the owner of Average Joe's. The gyms find out that there would be a dodgeball tournament held in a few weeks with a grand prize of fifty thousand dollars. Average Joe's need that money or else the gym goes to Globo Gym. The gyms ended up going and making it to the finals. But who wins? The movie will tell you that. All of the supporting actors were funny especially Rip Torn as Patches O'Houlihan. If you like Ben Stiller, you will like this movie. I rate this film a 10/10.",/review/rw0921659/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2004,bob the moo,," Very silly but fun despite the odd patch of misses
","Peter La Fleur runs a second rate gym that is populated by non-paying members who are, shall we say, on the edge of society. Peter's relaxed existence is made difficult by the fact that a large gym across the road aims to shut him down. When the Average Joe gym receives its final warning from the bank, they face a 30-day deadline to come up with $50,000 or lose the gym to competitor White Goodman. After their initial ideas fail, they discover that the national dodgeball contest has a prize of that very amount  with a little help from an ex-champion, they set out to make it to the finals and save the day.",/review/rw0921659/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2004,MCETXCEM,," Forget the Nay Sayers!!, This is a Damn Funny Movie!!
","I just watched Dodgeball last night and I can't remember laughing so hard at a movie in years, from Vince Vaughn finally being cast as a person you can like to Rip Torn who is always at his best as the sarcastic coach who is full of colorful one-liners, and I didn't start out as a Ben Stiller Fan, but his movies have seriously picked up in quality lately",/review/rw0921659/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2005,mjw2305,7," Pretty much as funny as they say it is
","When average Joe's gym, run by Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) is under threat of take over by White Goodman (Ben Stiller), La Fleur and his gym members must raise $50,000 to save it. The only way to do it is Dodge Ball, and with the help of a seasoned professional, maybe they have a chance.",/review/rw0921659/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2020,bevo-13678,10," It's a film about dodgeball
",I like the bits where they throw balls at each other. Especially when they hit people in the face. Sometimes they throw wrenches too,/review/rw0921659/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2004,hrivnak,10," Oh my God, this movie is funny!
","I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in years. That's all I can really say about this movie. It's stupid, sure, but it's so hilarious, you don't care.",/review/rw0921659/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2005,mstomaso,6," Fun piece of camp comedy
","What's funny about dodgeball? First, it's a movie about a group of non-competitive and somewhat eccentric adults playing dodgeball to save a not-very-impressive gym from the clutches of a competitive monopolistic chain gym. Second - Ben Stiller. Stiller is over-the-top and hilarious as the evil nemesis of average Joe Vince Vaughn. Vaughn - playing the slightly less than average Joe owner of Average Joe's gym, plays the perennial hard luck loser to the hilt. The supporting cast is terrific. Alan Tudyk, Rip Torn, Christine Taylor and Stephen Root are a great ensemble.",/review/rw0921659/?ref_=tt_urv

20 July 2008,roy-c,8," Great Fun!
","Picked this up on DVD for £3 ($6) - didn't know anything about it We thought it one of the funniest films we've seen for some time. Thought I'd check out the rating and was surprised how low (6.6) it was. Then checked out some of the ""Hated It"" comments to see why this could be I guess that a lot of people find this film offensive, with stereotypical attitudes - like how a bisexual woman could kiss both a man and a woman (an extraordinary observation). Or that it was unfair to poke fun at someone who spent all his waking hours dressed up as pirate. I think that comment came from a member of the Long John Silver Alliance.",/review/rw0921659/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,7," Silly but hugely enjoyable, much better than I thought it would be
","Well what can I say? Hugely enjoyable, silly yes but manages to be enjoyable. Yes with a predictable story that occasionally loses its lustre and some flimsy gags and a number of clichés. But what makes it watchable is the hilarious script, the good-natured spirit of the film, likable and relateable characters and fun performances from Vince Vaughan(really cool in one of his better movies- and performances as well), Ben Stiller, Rip Torn and Hank Azaria with an amusing cameo from David Hasselhoff. The direction is also good, and the film is nice to look at with a cool soundtrack. Overall, not perfect but watchable and funny. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw0921659/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2021,richardchatten,6," ""Dodge, Duck, Dip, Dive and Dodge""
",The presence of Ben Stiller usually promises fun and this crude and raucous but brightly coloured and basically good-natured cross between 'Rollerball' and 'Slap Shot' combines digs at the American need to win at all costs with a few nice ideas; such as the cute punch line given leading lady Christine Taylor.,/review/rw0921659/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2005,lee_eisenberg,10," There was an article about Joel David Moore in The Oregonian two days ago.
","""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" is just plain old goof-ball-ism, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. It has the Average Joes gym going up against Globo Gym in a tournament. The Average Joes gym is clearly a working class gym, while Globo Gym's slogan is ""We're better than you, and we know it!"" Maybe for the most part, this is a recycled triumph of the underdog story - where against all odds the ragtag team defeats the big guys with all the money - but the performances carry it to excellence. Ben Stiller, as Globo Gym owner White Goodman, makes a really funny slime-ball. Vince Vaughn, as Average Joes gym owner Peter La Fleur, creates a very commendable character. Christine Taylor, as reporter Kate Veatch, is what a reporter should be. Rip Torn, as trainer Patches O'Houlihan, is one acerbic SOB (Hank Azaria plays his younger self). And I now realize that Fran Stalinofskivich (from Ramanovia) was played by Missi Pyle, who also starred in ""Bringing Down the House"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"".",/review/rw0921659/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2016,BA_Harrison,8," You'll have a ball.
","An archetypal (and purportedly true) underdog story, Dodgeball sees Vince Vaughn as lovable but apathetic gym owner Peter La Fleur, who, with his band of misfit customers, enters a national dodgeball tournament to try and win the $50,000 he needs to prevent his business from being acquired by corporate fitness freak White Goodman (Ben Stiller).",/review/rw0921659/?ref_=tt_urv

20 March 2006,ccthemovieman-1,6," 'Patches' Mends This Tired Formulamatic Comedy
","Well, here is yet another sleazy PG-13 modern-day comedy that also has genuinely funny characters and scenes. For those of us who care it's a shame we have have to put up with the bad stuff if you want laughs out of about any comedy made in the last 30 years....and this is a prime example. By the way, this is an ""R"" all the way, if any concerned parents are reading this. You need a computer to add up all the sex jokes in here and the last 30 minutes are really, really stupid. Both of those are typical, too. Yet, most of my friends said this was hilarious and to check the film out. ",/review/rw0921659/?ref_=tt_urv

1 August 2009,hitchcockthelegend,8," Not just a film for average Joe's.
","Peter LaFleur {Vince Vaughn} is the owner of Average Joe's Gym, barely making any cash, LaFleur looks like losing his Gym to corporate big hitters, Globo Gym. Globo Gym, run by sleazy White Goodman {Ben Stiller}, is the complete opposite to Joe's, big money, big clientèle and big ego's. So when the few hardy members of Joe's decide to enter the Vegas Dodgeball Tournament, in the vain hope of winning the cash prize to save the gym, it's no surprise that Goodman enters his own team to hopefully thwart their plan.",/review/rw0921659/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2004,Quinoa1984,7," Funniest Sports Comedy since BASEketball (and, luckily, in that comedic tradition)
","One of the things that debut filmmaker Rawson Marshall Thurber gets right at the start of Dodgeball, and runs with for the whole length of the film, is that if you're making a film out of this story (that includes the a-typical story and characters, in a comedy genre or otherwise) there's got to be a laugh a minute, literally.  And, amazingly, Thurbert pulls it off, along with a great ensemble cast headed by Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn.  Because there is also a constant urge to make fun of anything, that nothing is out of bounds, disbelief is completely suspended, and Thurber reaches (credible) ZAZ comedy territory.",/review/rw0921659/?ref_=tt_urv
