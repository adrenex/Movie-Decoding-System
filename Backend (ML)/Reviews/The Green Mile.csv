23 April 2014,robert-temple-1,10," Even better than Inspector Morse
","This is a review of Series One to Seven of LEWIS (also known as INSPECTOR LEWIS). I never imagined that a sequel series could surpass the original (INSPECTOR MORSE), but this is what has happened. The stories, writing and direction remain of the same excellent quality, but it is the performances which really put the series over the top. John Thaw as Inspector Morse often overdid the querulousness and could be a bit irritating sometimes, which was meant to be part of his character. But now that he has the top job, Kevin Whateley as Lewis has really come into his own as a heavyweight actor of true stature. He has made Lewis into such a rounded and convincing character that he is more compelling than Morse ever was. (Perhaps this solidity of character is due to Whateley being a direct descendant of one of the three notorious Thompson Brothers, all of them Parliamentary colonels, of the 1640s and 1650s.) But even Whateley's superb acting cannot match the eerie and uncanny brilliance of Laurence Fox's performances as Detective Sergeant Hathaway. Rarely in a TV series has any actor created such massive complexity of character with such understatement and minimalism. Fox's work is sheer genius. One is tempted to compare Fox with John Hamm in MAD MEN (see my review), where we hang on Hamm's every silence, expecting him to speak, but when he does not, we accept the profundity of his silence as part of his secretive character and sympathise with him. This is very much the case with Fox, whose brooding internal life makes us concerned for him. The strong performances of Clare Holman as the pathologist and Rebecca Front as the Chief Superintendent are equally important in giving the essential fibre to the series to ensure its success. Holman's perpetual cheeriness is rather infectious, and all the more fascinating in that she shows it when inspecting corpses. This series (which will have a Season 8 before long) is a magnificent success in every respect. Dom Perignon all round! However, one does have a certain sympathy with the population of Oxford, which has been diminished by so many murders after all of these years that one wonders that there is anyone left alive in either town or gown. I noticed that there appear to be heavy filming restrictions in place, for in none of the episodes do we see the commercial district or the roads with the most traffic. I only recall seeing Oxford Market used once. We never see the High Street except for the small area at the end by Magdalen Bridge. Oxford comes across all glamorous and antique, and you would never suspect there were other parts of the town which are glum rather than glam. The Sheldonian appears to be everywhere, and every angle of that has been covered many times. Some of the colleges appear to have said no. I have never seen the quaint battlements of New College in an episode, for instance. We never see Magdalen's deer park, we never see the endless walks along the river, which are inaccessible to filming vans. In a sense, a mythical Oxford provides the backdrop for this series. But then, that strangely adds to the effect, for by creating the illusion of an Oxford that goes on forever but is really often the same locations shot from new angles, the illusion of endless murders seems only a natural part of the equation D = ME, where D is drama, M is murder, and E is episodes. It is clear according to this equation that the drama can increase linearly if either the murders increase, the episodes increase, or both increase together. No analysis has yet been made formulating an equation expressing the rates of increase, whether two murders per episode cause an acceleration of the heartbeat, and whether nonlinear phenomena occur, such as particularly shocking murders leading to quantum jumps, i.e. hearts skipping beats. I go to Oxford so rarely these days, but on one visit what did my wife and I see but Kevin Whateley getting in and out of his police car near Merton College as the cameras rolled, on the same side of the street as Anthony a Wood's house. Long may he go on doing so. And let us hope that some future edition of Athenae Oxoniensis includes John Thaw, Kevin Whateley, and Laurence Fox as worthies, which they clearly deserve.",/review/rw7450114/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2016,tomsview,10," Perfect ingredients
","Of all the crime/mystery series that have been on television, I enjoyed ""Lewis"" the most. At first I didn't think it was possible for it to supersede my love for ""Morse"" but it happened quickly.",/review/rw7450114/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2010,Rupert17,9," Lewis steps out of Morse's shadow.
","Lewis hits the spot for me. Great location shots of Oxford, typically unbelievably complicated plots where the destination seems less important than journey, and Kevin Whately's now rather world-weary Inspector Lewis trawling his way through police procedure to arrive at the right solution.",/review/rw7450114/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2016,safenoe,10," Lewis is the tops
","Ironically I never was drawn to Inspector Morse, but I immediately became a big fan of Lewis. Having visited Oxford awhile ago, it was fascinating to see the Oxford University colleges being a backdrop to a series that's expertly scripted and with outstanding performances.",/review/rw7450114/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2012,BeneCumb,9," Great series - with fine-looking Oxford as a supporting actor :)
","British crime series are always worth watching - even if they are longer than usual, having the length of a real separate film. Vivid, but still realistic characters, picturesque landscapes-townships and short (or sometimes even not visible) evil deeds form a quality standard and widening the audience not keen on constant explosions-fights-killings. I used to watch ""Inspector Morse"" - and I liked it - and ""Lewis"" has the same high level, with one exception: now the supporting character (Hathaway, played by Laurence Fox) is more interesting to me than the main one. It is not the question of acting, but the lines imputed to the persons involved.",/review/rw7450114/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2011,batmancox,10," Could become a classic
","I was sceptical when I first heard of ""LEWIS"". Morse had been such an incredible series that I felt sure Lewis would simply cash in on it and be a poor follow on. How wrong I was! Whilst I'm not saying that it has met the incredibly high standard of Morse it is a truly great series in its own right.",/review/rw7450114/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2016,TheLittleSongbird,9," A more than worthy successor to Inspector Morse and stands very well on its own two feet
","Hearing about Lewis for the first time when it first started, there was a big touch of excitement seeing as Inspector Morse was and still is one of my favourites but also a little intrepidation, wondering whether the series would be as good.",/review/rw7450114/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2012,DreamOfDreamsForgotten,9," Classic Mystery Reliably Rendered With Class and Style
","Call me an Anglophile, I don't care--it's probably true. This is a program for dedicated Anglophiles and those aspiring to be one. (LOL) The continuing adventures of Detective Inspector Lewis and his trusted sidekick Detective Sergeant Hathaway stand out for the strength of production values, acting, writing, and direction that are credits to the Masterpiece: Mystery! series tradition here in the States and television anywhere. Unlike most reviewers, I've never seen the Inspector Morse series which gave this one its genesis, but be assured I will be checking those discs out on Netflix shortly. Just know that this series stands completely on its own and is without peer, at least in my experience. The principals all acquit themselves with increasing wit and flair as the series progresses, creating a palpable matrix of living relationships which provide the sort of ongoing back story that insists you return, like that finish at the end of a wee dram of single malt, for more.

14 July 2022,Blumanowar,9," Oh wow, how great is this series!
","I've been enamored with British mysteries since I was in college (eons ago) and of course I've seen Inspector Morse and then Endeavour. I didn't find these until later in life and was absolutely taken by them. Addicted is a better word. As I finished Endeavour (I've not seen series 8 yet) I was sad that I figured I'd never see a mystery series that good again. But found this spin off and after two seasons I have to say it's far better than those two. I love this show. It's the writing in this series and less the acting. The actings great but Endeavours characters were better but the mysteries and the plot are much better here. I can't say enough good things about the show except to say if you've not seen it and are a fan of these types of shows this one is a MUST WATCH! And the acting is too notch I just thought Endeavours young Morse was exceptional. Enjoy !! I think I'm going to have to get Britbix to continue watching all the great shows of the BBC etc. They just don't do it like this in the US, that's for sure. I wouldn't trade an episode of this for any US movie I've seen in the last 5 years!",/review/rw7450114/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2010,Zen416,10," First Class Mystery Series
","When I want to see an action film or a thriller, no one, in my opinion, beats stuff made in North America. That being said, no one makes better mysteries than the British, and the ""Inspector Lewis"" series is proof positive of that. Kevin Whately is a stand-out as the eponymous character, a diligent yet sympathetic policeman who wears his middle-class background as proudly as he does his badge. It's nice to see Whately taking the helm in this series as it's lead after playing the wingman in the ""Inspector Morse"" shows for so long. He doesn't try to assume the John Thaw role but instead keeps this character all his own. James Fox is the perfect fit as his younger, book-smart partner Hathaway, a dude who can quote just about anything from anywhere, thanks in part to his scholarly background in Theology. These two guys have a very believable chemistry as police partners who work with each other's strengths (Lewis has the hunches it seems and Hathaway has his logic) to solve the multiple mysteries that crop up in the college town in Oxfordshire where they toil. The mysteries presented in the show are never too easy to figure out, giving you just enough clues to try to follow along. Often times it's a really cool surprise when the who-dun-it is solved at the end. I also want to add that, in addition to a great cast, great writing and so forth, they don't flog you with loud obvious music throughout that gives too much away (though yes, there is SOME music and it's quite nice actually). I'm a fan of this show and I hope they keep this series with it's fantastic cast going for a long time to come.",/review/rw7450114/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2017,dickjan-braggaar,10," Want to live in a Lewis-world
","Every time a new series of 'Lewis' appeared, my better half and I watched the lot from the beginning. A lovely way to get very acquainted with the actors, the humor, the stories and the music. From the pilot ('I used to row a bit') tot the end (with the LEWIS card just as in the pilot) it is a delight to watch. I never will understand people who think that on first viewing of a detective they saw it all. It's so multi-layered: first the crime, and when you digested that you can just enjoy the way it is made, the beautiful surroundings, the music, the humor, and last bus not least: the friendship. My god, how wonderful this is. When we watched the last episode my wife told me that she saw a tear in my eye. She was right.",/review/rw7450114/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2007,pawebster,7," Promising start to series
","The film was made to a high standard, in just the same way as the Morse films, with lots of attractive shots of Oxford. The story is a bit convoluted and not terribly credible - just as was often the case with Morse.",/review/rw7450114/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2022,Johnny_West,10," Hathaway is Better
","Insptector Lewis (Kevin Whately) was never the lead dog on the Inspector Morse series, and when he gets his own show, it is really Sergeant Hathaway (Laurence Fox) that is the brains of the detective team. In the last two series (seasons), Lewis retires and Hathaway becomes the lead detective. Lewis stays on as his consultant.",/review/rw7450114/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2022,wms-92741,8," A very satisfying program
","""Lewis"", like its predecessor ""Inspector Morse"" and its follow-up ""Endeavour"", is a wonderfully crafted and thoroughly enjoyable show about policemen solving crimes in Oxford.

2 October 2021,Dr_Coulardeau,9," The cesspool of an intellectual ghetto
","You have to be patient with this series. Lewis the sidekick of Morse is back after his wife was killed in a hit and run, his children were grown-up, back from who knows where in Canada and he will be with us till he finally leaves for New Zealand not to come back again, leaving Oxford to its own fate, and its fate is not that great since it is a ghetto of effete snobs who all pretend to be over the rest of the world, from the top Masters or Deans to the lowest bartenders. Vanity of Vanity Fair, pretension in purity, foreboding superiority that is based on the possession of words, some knowledge, and if no knowledge or words are available, just invent them all and rant and rave with big words and the world will be yours, crawling at your feet.",/review/rw7450114/?ref_=tt_urv

7 June 2015,hou-3,3," Disappointing, stale follow-up to Morse
","Morse was a classic series, largely due to the enigmatic central character brilliantly played by John Thaw, plus the wonderful music. Lewis I have watched again and again and despite the fine acting by Keven Whateley and Lawrence Fox, it never works. The sheer clunkiness of the plots, which Thaw somehow managed to transform or at least make tolerable, becomes oppressive, and panoramic shots of Oxford - always filmed in beautiful sunshine - are increasingly given prominence to try and make the whole thing work. The extended format, which weighed proceedings down in Morse, becomes totally tedious in Lewis. I know I'm in a minority on this but what the heck - in my view the follow-up was a mistake and that's that.",/review/rw7450114/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2018,ygwerin1,5," Hourly Episodes would be too long

28 September 2016,groupraphael,9," Almost Perfection
","I recently watched all the episodes again, starting with with Pilot (Episode 0, as labelled).This show is almost perfection, with fine acting and engaging story lines in a beautiful and civilized setting, except for the last few episodes when it tries to be a little too American. Sorry, there is no other way to put it. The stories become more and more violent, the characters added lack true representation of the British population (hardly any major South Asian characters) but most importantly, the focus shifts from Lewis, the middle-aged Gentle Hero (after whom the show is named!) to Hathaway the Young-and- the-Proud. Even the final scene is off-base. I believe the US backed production has something to do with this obvious shift, not realizing that one of the main reasons British crime shows are so popular in the US (and worldwide) is because, unlike their American counterparts, they are unrealistically more gentle and civilized in their approach to crime and also have something distinctly British about them. So, if any of the producers is reading this, please do not mess with a good thing. Thank you PBS, for getting it almost perfectly right.",/review/rw7450114/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2021,SunnyDaise,4," Ok to start with
","I liked the development from Morse and the flipped relationships between Lewis, Hathaway and Hobson. However, the characters' other conflicts were unoriginal. The widowed cop scenario has been done-to-death and Hathaway's struggle with religion was eventually irritating and unconvincing when it became apparent that, through the fault of the writers' lack of research, he really didn't know his faith's most sacred text, the Bible. If you're creating an academic show like this, you have to reference source materials accurately!",/review/rw7450114/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,dream_collector,9," Interesting dectective series with minimal violence
","Lewis is a spinoff of Inspector Morse, which started in 1987, and it focuses on the University of Oxford. The cases revolve around various students and faculty. This time around, Lewis (Kevin Whatley) is the DCI trying to use his critical thinking skills to identify perpetrators of murder. He lost his wife in a hit-and-run car collision, and he immerses himself in his work as a coping mechanism. His partner is Detective Sergeant James Hathaway (Laurence Fox). He's enigmatic in a way. He hardly ever discloses his feelings and Lewis has no knowledge of his past. It's a decent crime drama with limited violence and suspense. So if you're a fan of nail-biting, on the edge of your seat UK police procedurals (like Shetland), you might find Lewis kind of dull. I love Shetland, but I prefer Lewis when I'm not in the mood for something intense. I took off 1 star because it can be somewhat difficult to follow. Other than that, it's a great choice for a Friday or Saturday evening when you're just trying to relax.",/review/rw7450114/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2020,jimvandemoter-50236,10," Another great British mystery show.
","I was a big fan of Morse, so when I saw Lewis was getting his own series I was a little skeptical. Boy was I wrong. Lewis is everything I hoped it would be. Lewis is a perfect one step at a time methodical veteran detective while Hathaway is the perfect counterpoint. All in all a great team. What I like is this is not a rehash of Morse, it stands on its own. I also really the hour and a half episode format. It gives time for the story to develop. I just bought the entire DVD boxed set so I can watch the shows over and over.",/review/rw7450114/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2021,goodgriefspam,10," Only One Complaint: It's Over!!
","Just binged the whole series with my husband over the past few weeks and to my surprise I'm sitting here a little tearful that it's over. I will miss these characters deeply. Once in a while I get really attached-such a well-produced and classic body of work. I want more! I love British police procedurals and this one is a cut above. Really hoping there'll be an Inspector Hathaway series; it's been 6 years already. But you never know-Brits don't get in a hurry. Whately and Fox are an unbeatable team that don't disappoint. Plot lines are cerebral, challenging because they aren't easily solved, unlike so much vapidly predictable American programming (I am American). The supporting cast is strong and also very well-developed. Clare Holman is a delight. The costume designer captured the personalities well, and I particularly appreciated that both Holman and Front were brought forward as intelligent, sexy and confident middle-aged women. Hathaway's costuming portrayed him as a hipster, which gave him high sex appeal-nothing like an extremely educated and well-appointed stoic with a playful dry wit to compliment Lewis' old school (albeit slightly disheveled) charm and transparent integrity. Unlike the rest, the first episode was a bit slow, so persevere-you won't be disappointed!",/review/rw7450114/?ref_=tt_urv
