3 June 2019,abrahamjmr,10," Ahead of its time!
","This series was ahead of its time; there is no other way to describe such this amazing show that could have given way more that it was given the chance to. HBO shouldn't have let it go that easily, even though they gave it a proper ending it feels like you want to watch more and more. Patrick and all the characters are well played and every single taboo among the gay community is discussed or mentioned in a very smart, classy and way we all can learn about them.",/review/rw3221565/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2014,Maverick2014,9," It grows on you
",Three quarters of the reviews here are based on the pilot alone. Every TV lover knows pilots are not the way to judge the overall quality of a series. This is a series that grows on you slowly and by episode 6 (the best of the season) you will be rewarded! Everyone who's seen Weekend (2011) by the same Andrew Haigh knows what to expect in terms of plot and pacing. ,/review/rw3221565/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2014,nigel49,9," Fantastic series
","Interesting to read some of the reviews of this show.Personally I find it a very entertaining,very watchable show, certainly not slow, and as one reviewer commented its nothing but sex,sex, sex! I think he completely misses the point of what the the writers and producers of this show have given us. I find the show has a wonderful sense of time and place, like Maupins Tales of the City which was so evocative of San Francisco in the seventies, the TV shows from those books were also great,this new show is expressive not just of present day gay life San Francisco,but of many cities in North America. Its a funny,heartwarming and very real series,reflective of many sides of peoples lives, and insightful as to how many of us think and behave. I find the dialogue extremely effective, the acting A1, and am happy to see that there will be a season two. Keep it going!!!",/review/rw3221565/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2014,svanlijnden,8," Watch out for the must-see Looking! (See what I did there?)
","Looking follows a trio of friends in San Francisco as they deal with various dating conundrums and relationship drama. The first season consists of just eight, 30-minute episodes â€“ which sucks, because this series is great and addictive.",/review/rw3221565/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2014,gentelg,10," A magic little gem of a series look at gay life and love in the Obama era
",The show spoke to me in a way that QUEER AS FOLK never did. As a early 30 something I saw something in it that I could relate to. I know many did not and were hoping to see another campy gay soap opera filmed in Canada with guys who looked like Andrew Christian models that spent 8 hours a day at the gym. This was the first gay series that I ever watched that didn't feel the need to dumb itself down so the airhead club queens would get it. Nor did it feel as if it had to be political to the point of coming across like an ABC After-School Special. It just wants to tell a story about 3 (now 6) people living and loving in the magical city by the bay.,/review/rw3221565/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2019,kstathakiss,10," We need more LGBTQ series like this
","I have just recently finished watching Looking the series and the movie and I cannot find words to describe how realistically beautiful and emotional it was!! I must say I did not like Patrick as a character but he more than enough made up for it by the end of the movie. Seriously, we need more awesome quality series like this!! Too bad is was discontinued.",/review/rw3221565/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2014,asevbro1,10," Perfectly Paced!
","Some folks are complaining that the show seems ""too slow"" or ""is boring"". I disagree completely. I'm much more invested in the characters precisely BECAUSE it's not ""Hollywood slick"". The lines are utterly natural and real to me. Nothing seems ""forced"" or ""acted"". The sex-scenes are frank, but very tasteful and more is implied than ever shown, anyway. The humor is genuine and seems completely spontaneous. I really appreciate this more methodical approach. No, it doesn't represent every single facet of the gay community, but it isn't trying to either. Just the lives and loves of a few guys in San Francisco...that's all. It can't be everything to everyone...and shouldn't try. I love it so far. Hoping it's renewed!!!",/review/rw3221565/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2022,jromanbaker,10," A Great Achievement
","It is shocking to me that there were only two series and a movie of this very great achievement which was ' Looking ', as it was a fine and sensitive depiction of the normality of gay men's lives, and Andrew Haigh has perhaps not directed anything quite so fine before or after it. I know that ' Weekend ' was highly praised and rightly so, but the canvas there was to a certain extent limited. ' Looking ' was a broadening out of a perspective on male same-sex relationships and had in my opinion a deeper impact because it concentrated on a community. Islands of communication are often depicted in Gay Cinema (' Brokeback Mountain ' and ' Call Me By Your Name ' ) are two examples. Insular and ultimately defeated they show relationships between men that ' have ' to break apart whereas ' Looking ' did the opposite showing continuation through a network of friends and lovers. And it showed a maturity in age differences which considering the many young ' coming out ' films was refreshing and showed how life could be vibrant and alive once passed the age of 25. This is not a criticism of youth orientated films, but there should be a balance of representation which ' Looking ' fulfilled. I wish it could return, bringing back as many of the diverse characters as possible. Artistically perfect, excellently acted it is to me and very probably many others, sadly missed.",/review/rw3221565/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2014,Howlin Wolf,7," A flip look at a topic that some people think you should only approach seriously...

16 January 2015,jm10701,," The best so far
","This is by far the best gay television ever produced, and far better than all but one or two gay movies. Its greatness is owed to only two of the many talented people involved, without whom it would be merely good: Andrew Haigh, the creative genius behind it, and Jonathan Groff, its spectacularly versatile, gifted and delightful star.",/review/rw3221565/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2014,ericj871,9," Straight or gay, Looking is worth a look

4 February 2014,guipacker,10," Best gay TV show I have ever seen
","For the very first time, I feel like there's something on TV oriented for the gay public worth of my time. I immediately became hooked up on this show because the characters are not shallow or mechanical (as it usually happens in gay movies and TV shows), but deep, alive and fun - in great part due to the amazing actors. Also, the stories in every episode are incredibly compelling and don't make me feel ashamed of the ""gay world"" as it usually happened when I watched Queer as Folk or many other shows where characters only preocupation is to have sex. The three main actors certainly are doing a great job and I couldn't have chosen better ones to impersonate each character. Thirty minutes episodes are way too short. I absolutely love the show.",/review/rw3221565/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2021,fsfigge,10," I hardly write reviews
","And I'm not one to go out of my way to watch gay shows either (I am gay), but this one really hit me, just an overall good feeling show about love for gays without hardships or discrimination. The characters are lovely, I personally am in love with Dom, but I really enjoy how they've all played out. Really unfortunate that HBO decided to cancel it and all we got was a movie to finish it off. I need more!! To sum it up it's a great show with a very nice atmosphere and decently emotional writing. 9/10",/review/rw3221565/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2014,mario-kingfire,10," Good job HBO!
","Even though many say that this show isn't good, i must disagree. For the first time I'm able to see a show that is presenting the normal life of the gay people without many erotic scenes (I mean if you are looking for porn, then go watch porn..). So I think that this show is even better than QaF because it is much lighter, the characters are much more real (I mean Brian.. really? -.-)and grounded, also they are not feminine and finally, Looking is a show that presents us in a not stereotypical manner. I loved the thing that i didn't notice how the time flied while i watched the show, and at the end i felt like aw.. it ended.. :(. So I still can't understand why is there that much hate for this show. I have been looking for a show with gay main characters for a while now and i didn't like any of them as much as i liked the first episode of this show. Everything about this show is satisfying: The acting is very well, the plot is quite good (for a pilot at least), the characters are pretty likable, they are not like extremely hot nor ugly but quite normal looking and it makes you to connect with them so easily. I will definitely continue to watch this show and I sure hope that it will last long.",/review/rw3221565/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2015,t-dooley-69-386916,9," Brilliant and Engrossing Gay Soap
","Made by HBO this has quality written all over it. Based in San Francisco we meet three gay friends Patrick, Augustin and Dom. They are all at the ages when life becomes more serious which normally coincides with your options getting ever limited. Dom is a waiter about to turn forty and he really wants to be his own boss and meet that certain someone. Patrick makes video games and is single but sometimes lacking belief in his own talent. He also has a new boss and he is not only young, good looking but English.",/review/rw3221565/?ref_=tt_urv

12 September 2014,professorharoldlloydhill,8," Traditional soap opera conventions are strengthened by great writing, acting
","""Looking"" is sort of this generation's ""Boys in the Band"", the 1968 play (and 1970 film) that centered on gay men living in New York. We follow three men living in San Francisco, each at different stages in their romantic lives. One, Agustin, is moving in with his long time boyfriend, leaving behind perpetually single, and possibly commitment phobic Patrick, while their friend Dom is weary of growing older and hooking up with younger men. As the season progresses, these story lines get more complicated, as Agustin's carelessness jeopardizes his relationship, Patrick finds himself in a love triangle, and Dom finds himself falling for his older business partner. The show really just employs traditional soap opera conventions to it story lines, but what strengthens it are the actors and the writing. Jonathan Groff is likable and believable as Patrick, as is Murray Bartlett as Dom, and Frankie J Alvaraz, who plays Agustin is good in his role, but his character is unlikeable (and maybe deliberately so). The supporting cast is fantastic too and the scripts are both witty and engaging, Russell Tovey is fantastic as Patrick's new boss. The show's story lines are fairly realistic, and the characters are three dimensional and develop as the season goes along. They are selfish, they seem like real people. This is one thing I really liked about Looking. I can't wait for more.",/review/rw3221565/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2021,qui_j,7," Not perfect but should not have been cancelled
","The series wasn't an absolutely stellar one, but didn't deserve early cancellation. The problem was more with the quality of writing and superficiality of the script. There was no deep exploration of the characters and that made it seem as if they were people who just went from day to day without a plan. There were too many scenes where the dialog in the group resulted in babbling, unfinished sentences and talking over one another. That became annoying early on. It could have had a long run like ""Queer as Folk"" (US version) did if the writing had been more thoughtful and focused. Despite all the failings, it really did not merit cancellation as it could have been easily salvaged, had the shortcomings been appropriately addressed. It is far better than the current series ""Generation"" which is really over the top with all the non-binary, gender fluid stuff....without any story attached!",/review/rw3221565/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2015,rmcgee-57922,10," I adore this show!
","As a gay man, this show is so moving. It doesn't give us the usual stereotypes of what people think gay men are like, but rather what real gay men, and real people are. It is beautifully written, and the acting is just incredible. As a man approaching thirty, I relate so much to the characters and their struggles with love, friendship, and life. One of the best, and most realistic, series I have seen on television in a long time. Each character was so different from the next. All struggling with their own issues, and learning to cope with all the curve balls life throws at you. By far my favorite show on TV during its run. I highly recommend it to any gay man or woman, or anyone trying to understand our community a little better. We're more than what the media makes us out to be. We are human. And this show showed that unlike any other.",/review/rw3221565/?ref_=tt_urv
