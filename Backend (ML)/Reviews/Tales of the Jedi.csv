26 March 2005,iedsri,," How unfair!
","Having read the two previous comments, both of which read as though they had been written by two citizens of Superman's Bizarro World (where everything is exactly the opposite of how it is in real life), I felt I had to come to this fine series' defense. Taking the accusations one by one: ",/review/rw8650258/?ref_=tt_urv

11 March 2007,reverendaurore,10," Patrick Malahide is great!
","I am a compulsive reader and collector of books and DVD's. I disagree with any of the comments that state Patrick Malahide is not cast right as Inspector Alleyn. He is perfect in the role, as is Lang playing Agatha Troy. Having studied English actors for many years, I can't think of another pair that could have done a finer job in these roles. They are akin to the castings of Lord Peter Wimsey (Edward Petheridge) and Harriet Vane.",/review/rw8650258/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2012,xboy614,9," This is what English mysteries are like...
","Someone asked me what is are good English murder mystery to read and to watch. He had seen a lot of Agatha Christies' novels on the screen but was quite sick of them. I told him about Alleyn mysteries written by New Zealander Ngaio Marsh. The books are great and this short series are brilliant. Patrick Malahide is a perfect Roderick Alleyn and when I read the books I immediately picture Patrick as the main character. Belinda Lang suits the role as Troy and Inspector Fox is a likable person. The cases are terrific, my personal favourite being a man lay dead but they are all good. You'll find yourselves glued to the screen and as I said to my friend, this is what traditional English mysteries are like... a must watch.",/review/rw8650258/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2006,hayesbook,10," How could it be better?
","Malahide is an excellent Alleyn. I think the restraint, classiness, and beauty of these productions are unparalleled. I wish there were more of them. The actor playing Fox is a little scary at first but he grows on you. I wish that he had been bearded, though, as in the books.",/review/rw8650258/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2017,runsfast2002,9," It's a shame so few were made.
","After watching the eight episodes made with Patrick Malahide, I began re-reading Ngaio Marsh's books. I discovered her as a teenager, probably around the time this series aired, but never had an inclination to read them again. And after watching this series I know why. Marsh's description of Alleyn was so nebulous- basically tall, dark, thin, and handsome with a fastidious face in one instance or a monkish one in the other. He's a dapper silhouette, complete with hat and an excellently cut suit, but still a shadowy figure. Troy and Fox were easy to visualize, in fact apart from Belinda Lang's longer hair and William Simons' lack of a mustache, they are exactly as I pictured them, but Alleyn remained elusive. After seeing Malahide as Alleyn, it's so much easier to read the books because Malahide gives Alleyn a face and voice. I must admit I wasn't thrilled with Simon Williams' performance of Alleyn in the first episode. At times he had the ""Handsome Alleyn"" look, but that's about all.",/review/rw8650258/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2006,rob-robilliard,9," Excellent viewing - bring on more!
",I stumbled onto Inspectgor Alleyn on SBS Australia a few years ago. The series has never been broadcast on commercial TV. I waited impatiently for them to be released on DVD and hope that there is a Series 3 to be released.,/review/rw8650258/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2007,drmfreeman,10," One of the best BBC period mystery series
","We are avid consumers of BBC mysteries, and the Alleyn Mysteries are one our favorites. The acting from the lead players is subtle and involving (and far better than anything on American TV) and the usual variety of excellent British actors appear throughout the series. The stories are well written, the dialogue is convincing, the character development is enjoyable, and the directors respect the intelligence of the viewer. Highlights are the nuanced development of the relationship between Alleyn and his love interest Agatha Troy, and the delightful exchanges between the aristocratic Alleyn and his middle class next-in-command, Inspector Fox. The only disappointment is the limited number of these shows.",/review/rw8650258/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2017,jimmullinaux,10," Inspector Alleyn Mysteries - Highly Recommended!
","When it comes to crafting intelligent and entertaining television mysteries, the English simply do it better than anyone else. This excellent 1993 BBC1 series takes place in post-WWII England (c. 1948), even though Dame Ngaio Marsh's novels were set prior to the war. The production effectively captures the rather gray atmosphere so prevalent throughout the country after the war, from the drabness of the period's clothes to the exhaustion in the character's personalities. Patrick Malahide plays Chief Inspector Roderick Alleyn, and Belinda Lang portrays his love interest Agatha Troy, both remnants of Britain's post-war fading upper class. William Simons rounds out the cast as Alleyn's working-class assistant Detective Inspector Fox. The crimes are clever and their solutions sensible, surely to satisfy any mystery fan. My wife and I have viewed this series many times and find something new and enjoyable with each viewing. Highly recommended!",/review/rw8650258/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2004,lucy-19,," Miscast, misbegotten
","Ngaio Marsh was a brilliant writer and her detective stories would make a great TV series. Unfortunately this wasn't it. Patrick Malahide is a gifted actor, an Irishman who can infiltrate any layer of the English class system. But he's miscast as Roderick Alleyn, the series detective, who's not meant to be a stereotype toff. In the books he's more of a mirror for other characters. Troy, his wife, is turned from an individualist with her own career as a painter into the typical cop show whingeing wife (""You never have time for me!""). Adaptations are plodding and period detail ladled on. An opportunity missed. Read the books.",/review/rw8650258/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2005,drwho5-1,," Not the best casting but still solid series
","I like this series very well. I agree with the previous reviewer that the casting was not the best, in particular that of Agatha Troy. I do, however, think that Ngaio Marsh's supporting characters in her books are considerably more fleshed out than her lead characters. So, taking that into account I feel that the creators of this television series had plenty of leg room in deciding who to cast and how to have each actor play the parts. I wish the series had lasted long enough to include all 30+ novels. I do not know what led to the series' demise but I would guess that like other failed mystery series (Campion comes to mind) the ratings were probably not high enough to warrant the vast expenditures that period drama requires. The fact that Ngaio Marsh's books are rather dry and slow in pace compared to Agatha Christie's adds additional problems, making an exact transfer to television difficult. Still, the show is great and is well worth the money on DVD.",/review/rw8650258/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2007,les136-1,9," Decent representation of the books
","I've read all of the Inspector Alleyn novels by Ngaio Marsh and feel that this dramatic interpretation is good. Okay, I've got some minor gripes with parts of each of the shows. Basically they deal with the compaction of a novel into a limited time of 100 minutes. I think Malahide does a good job. Marsden's Dalgliesh gets a lot more time per title. _Devices_&_Desires_ ran 300 minutes, if I recall correctly. My opinion may also be shaped by my preference for Marsh over PDJ. IMO, Marsh writes more compactly than James. James spends more times with emotions. Its just a matter of style, neither is inherently better. However, I feel that PDJ ""Dalgliesh"" book series have gotten weaker after the middle of the series and have given up reading her newer books. Ngaio Marsh has a few downers here and there but I think she holds up over the long haul. I also prefer the period of the ""Alleyn"" series which is harder and more expensive to recreate than the more modern ""Dalgliesh"".",/review/rw8650258/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2017,Dr_Coulardeau,9," Quaint and disquieting
","These crime stories are interesting because they are quaint like hell, or heaven if you prefer. The crimes are situated after the second world war around 1948. They all happen in some areas that involve the upper classes of England, the aristocracy and nobility. Many sirs, lords and ladies. The main policeman is of course from Scotland Yard and he is a chief inspector very well introduced in the higher spheres of the government and in these very aristocratic upper classes, which gives him the privilege, and mind you that is a privilege that no one could have, to question and even slightly shake up and around these noble and/or rich people to get the truth out of them who consider their private business has nothing to do with Scotland Yard.",/review/rw8650258/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2005,JimPearson,," Don't both - just read the books
","I read a lot of this Ngaio Marsh series and enjoyed them thoroughly. Although not as good as the P. D. James Dalgliesh stories they are a very enjoyable read. So, after I found out that they were coming available on DVD I got the first one as soon as I could, in anticipation of a movie as good as the Adam Dagliesh movies with Roy Marsden. Unfortunately nothing could have been further from the truth. Patrick Malahyde is grossly miscast, showing nothing of the character from the book. The one I saw was so slow and badly done that I almost fell asleep - my wife did. There was almost no interplay of characters. Troy was hardly mentioned as an artist and inspector Fox just didn't feel right either. I'm not even going to bother with the rest of the series.",/review/rw8650258/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2006,annie-231,," Not worth the watch!
","I couldn't agree more with Lucy-19, this was an extremely poor adaptation of Ngaio Marsh - even the settings have no real charm. The whole idea of Troy was that she never showed any jealousy; of Alleyn's work or of his work related encounters; he once told her that he would 'crow like a bloody rooster' if only she would; and never, anywhere in any of the books did she accuse him of never having any time for her. What's more, Alleyn himself might be Eton and Oxford, but to portray him as the stereotypical upper-class Englishman is to completely negate his worth. Only William Simons as Inspector Fox is well cast and well interpreted. Sadly the point has been missed here and for any real Marsh fans this is not recommended.",/review/rw8650258/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2006,delboythespiv,," More comments on suitability
","I'm on the side of the dissenters here. Malahide is nothing like the Alleyn character, and Lang is nothing like the Troy one.",/review/rw8650258/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2009,gooley,1," Wrong in so very many ways to any fan of Ngaio Marsh's novels
","If the principal characters had had different names and each episode a credit such as ""using ideas from a novel by Ngaio Marsh,"" I would have given it a much higher rating. It would have at least been bearable rather than a travesty. I rented the set with great hopes despite the box-art picture of a gent who looked almost completely unlike my mental picture of Roderick Alleyn, and then only with difficulty sat through two episodes.",/review/rw8650258/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2022,peterdg2,," Not quite in the Agatha Christie league.
","I quite enjoyed this series and watched every episode, but it never really took off. Perhaps it seemed too polite and old-fashioned. Perhaps by the 1990s viewers were beginning to feel that all the paraphernalia of country houses, multiple suspects and poisons were artificial and dated.",/review/rw8650258/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,HugeDaiCottermee,10," Pages of the novels brought to life beautifully
","I have been a fan of Ngaio Marsh since I was a kids, and having read several novels before seeing the TV series I can safely say that Patrick Malahide is Roderick Alleyn. The pilot episode which featured the handsome and talented Simon Williams was a great introduction but I do think Malahide had the edge.",/review/rw8650258/?ref_=tt_urv
