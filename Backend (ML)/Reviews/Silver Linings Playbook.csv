16 December 2015,ferguson-6,7," Youth is in the eye of the beholder
","Greetings again from the darkness. With a Best Foreign Language Oscar for his previous film The Great Beauty (La grande bellezza), expectations were sky high for this one from writer/director Paolo Sorrentino. Cinematographer Luca Bigazzi is also back and the two create yet another artistic entrée that is a visual extravaganza, worthy of the admission price even if no dialogue existed. Combine the visual artistry with a commentary on age and emotions, and the result is a film that will either enchant or stultify  with probably no middle ground.",/review/rw5676602/?ref_=tt_urv

","When it comes to Paolo Sorrentino I don't know what to expect. On one hand I loved his first English work ""This Must Be The Place"" starring a wonderful Sean Penn; on the other hand I didn't quite enjoy his Oscar Winner ""The Great Beauty"". I was actually afraid this one was going to be another attempt at being Fellini. But Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel, Paul Dano and Rachel Weisz gave me the push to watch it. I'm glad I didn't wait, because this is Sorrentino's greatest beauty.",/review/rw5676602/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2015,pise-65431,10," Either you love it or you get nothing from it.
","I'm not a professional in film reviews, to begin with. I'm just an University student who's got an enormous passion for cinema. It was years since a movie moved my soul in such a profound way. I was stunned when I saw that the movie summed up a 7.5 rating here on IMDb. I thought about this fact for some days, then I kind of make up my answer. ""Youth"" is the symbol of many struggles in cinema and in people's mind. American movies and many Europeans ones as well are so easy to like, just because they're easy to follow. They show facts, actions, somehow explained by words and some ideas. Ideas are like the salt we put on on our meals to make them tasty. Films like ""Youth"" are the exact opposite: words and ideas are the ""meal"", and a few actions are the ""salt"". Actually all the actions are at the end of the movie, they could be perceived as a climax, but they're more like the conclusion of complex exchanges of ideas throughout the movie. I won't comment about technical features, because I don't have the expertise to do it. I just say that the soundtrack is somewhere near perfection, editing as well and there some beautifully shot scenes. As I said, my concern is not about that. ""Youth"" make the viewer think about life, old age, ethics, it accompanies us through some beautiful ideas, and this is where all pros and cons stay. This movie doesn't look for easy ways to impress the viewer, to make him/her somehow forcefully interested to what the screen shows, it requests an open mind and what I ironically call ""the 51st shade"": a fetish to thoughts, not only to material things. Some people don't like Sorrentino because they consider him a ""radical chic intellectual"". It is a righteous choice to be against ""intellectualism"" whatsoever, but it is as well righteous to be against ignorance.",/review/rw5676602/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2016,jboothmillard,8," Youth
","I saw the trailer for this film, I was instantly attracted because of members of the cast, and it did look interesting, and with good critical reviews and award nominations I was even more attracted, directed by Paolo Sorrentino (The Consequences of Love, This Must Be the Place, The Great Beauty). Basically Fred Ballinger (Sir Michael Caine) is a retired classical music composer, Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) is a filmmaker working on his next project, both men are Septuagenarians and best friends staying at a luxury resort in the Swiss Alps. Fred is approached by an Emissary for Queen Elizabeth II (The Inbetweeners' Alex Macqueen) who want him to perform his popular piece ""Simple Songs"" for the birthday concert of Prince Philip, Fred downs this offer down, saying he is not interested in performing anymore, although when alone he composes pieces in his head. Mick is working with a group of scriptwriters to develop the screenplay for his next film, which he calls his ""testament"", also with them is actor Jimmy Tree (Paul Dano) who is researching for an upcoming role and frustrated that he is only recognised for playing a robot. Other quirky individuals inhabiting the hotel include a young masseuse (Luna Zimic Mijovic), the overweight Diego Maradona (Roly Serrano) and Miss Universe (Madalina Diana Ghenea). Fred and Mick reflect on their lives, including women they both previously had feelings for and their friendship over the years, they admit that their memories are fading and they see little in their futures. Fred's daughter Lena (Rachel Weisz) is his personal assistant and married to Mick's son, but the husband leaves her for pop star Paloma Faith, who he says is much better in bed, Lena vents her anger on her father, who was always distant during her childhood and growing up. The Emissary returns with the same offer for Fred, he still refuses to play his popular piece, even for royalty, the Emissary gets frustrated with the lack of explanation, Lena cries when Fred finally explains that the soprano part of his ""Simple Songs"" belongs to his wife, but she can no longer sing, the Emissary understands. Mick completes his screenplay with the writers and is satisfied, his leading actress Brenda Morel (Golden Globe nominated Jane Fonda), who the role is written for and has worked with Mick on eleven of his previous films, makes a surprise visit to the resort, Brenda tells him she has taken a television role instead, she says television is the future and cinema is the past, she also tells Mick he has not made a good film in years. Mick is disheartened and hallucinates all of his leading ladies, including Brenda, surrounding him, he has a final talk with Fred and jumps off the balcony right in front of him, Fred is devastated. Following the funeral for his friend, Fred decides for the first time in years to visit his wife, she is senile and in a care home in Venice, in the end Fred returns to the United Kingdom for the concert before the Queen and the Prince to conduct ""Simple Songs"", with new soprano Sumi Jo. Also starring Ed Stoppard as Julian, Nate Dern as Funny Screenwriter, Alex Beckett as Bearded Screenwriter, Mark Gessner as Shy Screenwriter and Tom Lipinski as Screenwriter in Love. Caine gives a great performance as the veteran conductor refusing to perform for royalty for emotional personal reasons, Keitel is also likable as the aged movie producer and director, they are a great double act, Fonda is fantastic in her short appearance, Weisz is good, and there is a scene-stealing nude scene from the gorgeous Ghenea. This is a great example of an art house film, director Sorrentino is known for doing these sorts of films, it is an unusual blend of simplistic scenes, combined with a witty and funny script, surreal and psychedelic material, and wonderful music by David Lang, all add up to a satisfying alternative comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Song for the beautiful ""Simple Song #3"". Very good!",/review/rw5676602/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2015,murtaza_mma,8," One of the best films of the year
",There is a sense of nostalgia in the films of Paolo Sorrentino. The nostalgia often comes across as a sense of regret for the loss of innocent love experienced by the central characters during their youth. Such a regret can easily fills one's heart with melancholy but Sorrentino seems to have mastered the art of mixing gravity with levity. His films can be both serious and farcical at the same time and that's why they are more complex than what they prima facie appear. Youth‬ is no different.,/review/rw5676602/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2019,micule-ieva,10," A not so little gem along the others!
","My first comment is among these days when films are fast & supposed to be exciting this film is slow with subtle words and actions. It is so rare to witness that. I should recommend watching more films like this one. Not to mention the performance of the actors who give this feeling. I don't about the crew or producers, but the director Paolo Sorrentino had nailed it - all of it!",/review/rw5676602/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2016,oscaralbert,10," Some of the reasons that YOUTH is better than REVENANT . . .
",". . . are that ""Melanie Ballinger"" is far scarier than any Gentle Ben grizzly bear, and Jane Fonda comes awful close to upstaging Leo's bruin in the fright department herself, not to mention Harvey Keitel and Paul Dano. When ""Hitler"" places as just the fourth creepiest character in a flick, you know that that picture has a lot going for it. Ask yourself this, as well: Did REVENANT feature a well-endowed full-frontal Miss Universe? Or a command performance of a haunting tune for the Queen? Or a dozen amazing live acts on a turntable? Or cow symphonies? Or a Daddy\Daughter nightmare-in-bed scene? Or violin lessons? Or massage tables where happy endings are not foregone conclusions? Or existential fights for survival where the combatants are fresh and clean, NOT scruffy and infested? Or a dying fat man able to volley a tennis ball off his ankle? Or one intriguing mystery after another to keep you guessing? Or breath-taking strolls through the Swiss Alps? Is REVENANT really anything more than a tedious slog through the swamps of Yesteryear?",/review/rw5676602/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2016,zetes,9," Probably not for everyone, but I loved it
","I'm not sure if the parts of this film make a great sum, but all the parts sure are fantastic! I quite loved this bizarre little film from the director of The Great Beauty. In fact, I liked it more than The Great Beauty, which I also liked a lot. Michael Caine stars as a retired composer/conductor who is spending a week at a ritzy Swiss spa. His longtime best friend, Harvey Keitel, a still-working film director, is also there. There isn't a strong plot here, more a series of vignettes, but much of Caine's plot revolves around an emissary from Queen Elizabeth II trying to get him to come back from retirement to play a concert for Prince Philip's birthday. Keitel is working on his new film with a slew of young, hipsterish writers. Other subplots involve Caine's daughter, Rachel Weisz, dealing with her husband's leaving her, and Paul Dano plays an actor who's a little peeved he's best known for playing a robot in ""that robot movie."" There are other little subplots, although I'd more call them just weird characters wandering around the spa. Sorrentino obviously wants to be the heir to Fellini, and he's doing a pretty good job of it. This film doesn't feel as much like Fellini as The Great Beauty did, but he has Fellini's eye for casting wonderful weirdos to populate his movies. In particular, I'm totally in love with Caine's masseuse, the gal with the braid and the braces, played by Luna Zimic Mijovic, whom we get to watch dance along to a video game a couple of times and it's just heavenly. Both Caine and Keitel are wonderful. Weisz gets to steal the film for one big monologue, though she's great for the rest of it, too. I don't know if I entirely get it, but I loved it, and it's one of the best of the year.",/review/rw5676602/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2020,stefanschrama,10," Out of breath
","Barely 5 minutes out of the movie and I am still catching my breath. What started off as a almost comical movie turned into a deeply layered masterpiece. The unexpected, the unnecessary, the necessary... I wish I could express what the scenes do to you as a viewer but you must experience this yourself. Preferably sitting on a not too comfortable couch or chair. This is not a luxurious movie spoiling you, although the scenery of the movie tells otherwise. It takes work, it takes work for you to understand the characters. But please, undergo this work. Feel what they are feeling. See what they are seeing and you will experience, what they are experiencing. I have laughed, cried, judged, held my breath and experienced this movie as ad adventure. Thank you, Paolo Sorrentino.",/review/rw5676602/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2017,moonspinner55,1," Life's Last Day
","Gaspingly pretentious portrait of characters at a resort hotel and spa in the Swiss Alps. Michael Caine is a British widower and retired symphony conductor--an annual guest at the spa for some 20 years--who refuses a request from an emissary of the Queen of England to conduct again for Prince Philip's birthday celebration. Caine's grown daughter is temporarily staying with him; she's distraught over her recent breakup with the son of another guest, screenwriter Harvey Keitel, an exercise-friend of Caine's who commiserates with him over their combined years and non-working body parts. Other guests include a rock-climbing instructor, a film actor, assorted child prodigies, a beauty contest winner, et al. Writer-director Paolo Sorrentino has a grandiose visual concept, which he makes clear within the film's first 10 minutes; however, his artistically-composed shots of naked, sagging bodies (usually slumped over in states of depression, inert in the steam rooms or floating aimlessly in the swimming pools) are not especially pointed or amusing. The shots call attention themselves, probably to distract the viewer from the lack of substance in the writing (or interest in the central characters). Caine, pinkish-white like a rabbit, seems to look out at the world with bleary eyes--but is this the character or simply the actor in bad physical shape? Keitel doesn't appear very spry either, but the worst is saved for Jane Fonda (in a bad blonde wig) as a jaded, foulmouthed actress just in from Los Angeles (she asks Keitel expository questions to set the scene: ""How long have we known each other, Mick?""). ""Youth"" flatlines at the one-hour mark--with another 63 minutes on the clock. * from ****",/review/rw5676602/?ref_=tt_urv
