29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," I enjoyed it!
","As a huge fan of Marvel I'm a little biased because I pretty much like everything they put out. My bias aside, Iron Fist is a pretty good show. It's definitely the weakest of all the Marvel shows but that doesn't mean it's bad. The other ones are just that good. I still think this a good show that's definitely worth watching! It's too bad that Netflix couldn't renew their contracts with Marvel and they had to stop making the Netflix Marvel shows because every single one of them was great! Now that they're on Disney they can bring these wonderful characters back. They already started to with Daredevil and Kingpin and just renewed Daredevil for another season. Now they have to do the same for The Punisher, Luke Cage amd Jessica Jones. While Iron Fist definitely won't get renewed because it was the weakest, they cam still bring some of these Iron Fist characters over to some of their other MCU shows. If you're a Marvel fan then this is a must watch!",/review/rw8088541/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," It's actually pretty good!
","Iron Fist is obviously not as good as the other Marvel Netflix shows (The Punisher, Daredevil, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, The Defenders), but it's still a pretty good show that's absolutely worth watching! I have to admit that I liked Iron Fist a lot more than some judging by some of these reviews but that's because most of the negative reviews are by people comparing it either to the other shows or the comic books. I don't understand why people get upset become a show or movie isn't exactly like the comic book! Stop being such a nerd and just enjoy it for what it is! Iron Fist starts a little slow but stay with it because it picks up and turns into a pretty good show.",/review/rw8088541/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2017,tone_e2000,7," Stop being offended on my behalf
","Cultural appropriation: a phrase that is never too far from a press review of Iron Fist. It's also what I'm focusing on here, rather than the questions about this show's pacing and editing (for the record, I think it's great).",/review/rw8088541/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2022,hayesmikiet,10," Worth the investment of time.
","I honestly don't understand the hostility that this series has received: lower than deserved ratings and complaints about the plots and acting. Nonsense. I thought the cast was solid in every way. All the leads were stellar. I thought the overarching plot was better than either season of Daredevil or the first of Luke Cage (I've only seen one... watching them all in order), both of which were very good series. All in all, Harold Meachum was a far better and more interesting, cunning, and sinister antagonist than Wilson Fisk, Cottonmouth, or Diamondback. I typically enjoy D'Onofrio, but he became tedious for me in that role. The finest villain in these shows, for me, will always have been Kilgrave in Jessica Jones. Outstanding! Danny was a super likable hero and the Meachums were terrific. I absolutely love the crossover characters in all the series... Clair, Gao, Hogarth; the synergy there is fantastic. If you love Marvel and love plots with mystical aspects, this is terrific! One last thing... All four of the series that I've watched thus far have suffered from too many episodes - especially Daredevil and Luke Cage. I would have given them nine, possibly 10, episodes per season. Jessica Jones and Iron Fist did better with the allotted time, but that said, could have done it all in about 11 full episodes. I would probably give it an 8.8 for the entire season... But I gave it 10 to offset some of the ridiculous low scores.",/review/rw8088541/?ref_=tt_urv

24 March 2017,yoyopa,7," Hmmm
","Let me start out by saying: I'm an actor, so criticizing other actors is not my thing. Also, I understand that with a series like this, the choices that are made are made by several people not just the lead actor him/herself. I say all of this because I've seen some scathing comments directed at Finn Jones. I very much enjoyed the series, and I still standby the idea that everything Marvel/Netflix has done absolutely dwarfs the CW/DC series on television..makes DC look like a childs coloring book. Even Marvel/Netflix at their weakest episodes is still better.",/review/rw8088541/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2022,AnnaPagrati,8," Great!
","A really great series! I was really invested in the beginning, but by the time it ended I realized I didn't enjoy it as much as some other Defenders shows, but nevertheless, it was great!",/review/rw8088541/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2020,Johnny_West,5," Danny is always the dumbest person in every episode
","I watched every episode. After a while, I kept count to see if Danny Rand always made the dumbest choices and decisions in every episode. He did. He was by far the dumbest character in every single episode. His competition for stupidity award was triad goons, hatchet thugs, street criminals, drug dealers, and all of his family and friends. It seemed like in every episode, there would be some core decision that was up to Danny, and he always made by far the dumbest choice that was possible.",/review/rw8088541/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2022,vibhus-17780,6," Decent
","Not bad as I thought . First of all writers didn't done a great job , writing was weak , subplots was meaningless , characterisation wise main character Danny Rand wasn't impressive , his character design was too weak , but other supporting characters had good arc . When it comes to Direction , Action sequence were poorly executed in first season , editing were too clumsy , in second season they did better in action . Series overall doesn't feels boring , some of the character arc will be interesting and action sequences in second season were good . Overall eventhough it has many flaws , it falls on decent category .",/review/rw8088541/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2018,mii-98398,4," Bad writing
","I hoped the second season would fix the show, but instead, they added bad writing to make the show even worse than before. Generally speaking, if you are looking for an action Sci Fi with a good story, then Iron Fist is not the answer.",/review/rw8088541/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2017,riefenstein001,8," Pretty decent show, doesn't deserve all the hate
","I binge watched already the whole show since I'm sick at home. I was aware of all the bad critics, but I had nothing else to watch. I was pretty surprised, the show has an entertaining storytelling, good acting (I like Finn as the sometimes childlike but also wise Danny Rand), some humor, sometimes a little bit cheesy, good fight scenes (even though Daredevils hallway scene is unparalleled ). I would rate the show in line with Luke Cage and Jessica Jones, Daredevil is better, but Iron Fist doesn't deserve the hate. It has also three strong, interesting female characters: Rosario Dawson has a comeback as the Night Nurse, but in stronger appearance than in Daredevil or Luke Cage. Also Jessica Henwick as Coleen Wing is a great female lead and Madame Gao is a wonderful fleshed out female villain. Give it a try.",/review/rw8088541/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2017,nvfone,1," Unwatchable
","I saw about half of this before finally giving up. Finn Jones is utterly unwatchable. He's as bad as that guy who played Anakin Skywalker and I hope his name quickly fades from memory like that guy's did. Unfortunately, I assume they'll bring him back in The Defenders, which will be a real shame because Finn Jones will completely bring down the value of that production.

19 May 2019,SnoopyStyle,5," bad intro = worst of pocket universe
","A shoeless Danny Rand (Finn Jones) walks into the headquarters of his family's company Rand Enterprises in New York seeking answers. It's been 15 years since he was presumed killed along with his parents in their private jet flying over the Himalayas. He was the sole survivor. He's raised by monks in K'un-Lun, and taught martial arts. He finds the company had been taken over by family friend Harold Meachum and left to his kids, Ward (Tom Pelphrey) and Joy (Jessica Stroup) after Harold's death. In reality, Harold had faked his death and running the company in secret using Ward as his puppet. At first, no one believes Danny. When Danny confronts Ward with childhood memories, Ward immediately sends his security team to kill Danny. Local martial arts teacher Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick) witnesses the attack and comes to believe Danny after the Meachums lock him up in a psychiatric hospital. Davos is Danny's former best friend from K'un-Lun who is bitter at not being Iron Fist.",/review/rw8088541/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2021,Leofwine_draca,3," Waste of time show
","The most lame-brained of all the Marvel Netflix TV shows. This one suffers largely from bad writing, the bane of any bad TV or movie, but also struggles with a charisma-free lead actor. Jessica Henwick is left to clean up the mess and does a pretty good job of it, so it's a shame she wasn't the lead.",/review/rw8088541/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2018,tert72,6," Hmm an iron fist without the iron fist
","I could write a long review but basically. Take a bunch of teenagers, have them write a script, and you have season 2. With Colleen every episode giving an after school special, literally said about a group of murderous thugs, well they've had a rough life. Oh ok, so it's fine to slit a kids throat, cause you know, they have had a rough time. And now you have Colleen with the power of the iron fist, I mean shoot grab a copper bowl, hire some tattoo artists and you too can have an iron fist. So the actual iron fist no longer has the iron fist. And for being one of the best fighters in the world, he gets his ass kicked pretty much throughout season 2. And won't even get into Mary walker. If you liked the comic book or any Canon that deals with the iron fist, well, the teenage writers destroyed this season.",/review/rw8088541/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2022,yuankun99,10," Had potential
","I watched this show for the first time in March of 2022. Season 1 was good with some boring parts. Season 2 was terrible, felt like the series focused too much on Colleen Wing and forgot that Danny Rand was the main character of the show. Everything Danny did was wrong and Colleen would correct him like if she was his mom. I'm not getting into Spoilers here, so, if you watch this show just pay attention on this. The other characters were super annoying to watch, Ward, Joy, Misty, all boring. I'm upset that in the show, Joy would get away with everything and be forgiven all the time for terrible things. The ending of the show is very upsetting, not cause the show ended but cause how they ended. Honestly, the name of the show felt like should have been changed to Colleen Wing, cause Danny was just a supporting character at the end.",/review/rw8088541/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2017,gca_36,1," Really crap!
","Sorry Marvel, but this show is really trash in a really negative way. Finn Jones is definitely a miscast. The main character acts like a simpleton and has no development at all. The fighting scenes are the worst I have ever seen, which brings us back to Finn Jones. He is not a martial artist and this raises the question, why was he the first choice for this role? Even as an actor he doesn't do a good job. Well, maybe he was the only one available for the budget.",/review/rw8088541/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2017,deny-966-237037,1," Horrible
","Plot holes, annoying characters, crappy fight scenes - this one's got it all. But what really sets it apart from other shitty shows is that it's full of characters who are supposedly following this or that oriental philosophy and training martial arts, but still behave like idiotic spoiled rich kids who throw a tantrum whenever things don't go as expected. Ask any martial artist with years of training if they'd behave like that and out of 100 of them you'll hear 100 ""no""s. And did I mention how *bad* the fight scenes are? They did use the harnesses that allow them to do those crazy flying-like stunts, but without proper combat training and more importantly, good editing, it looks even more ridiculous. On the bright side, Jessica Henwick is very cute and Tom Pelphrey is one of the best actors I've ever seen, he literally steals the show, honestly and makes it worth it if just for the acting lessons.",/review/rw8088541/?ref_=tt_urv
