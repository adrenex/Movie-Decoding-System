3 July 2021,ThomDerd,6," Entertaining, but...such a stupid plot.
","Time travel movies are fun, aliens are fun and Chris Pratt is fun to watch.",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,Nemesis42,6," Forget logic, enjoy the action.
","The logic behind main story movements in this is completely ridiculous, though these shortcuts are designed to make the film as satisfying and entertaining as possible. If you want entertainment and feel good action, have a ride with this!",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2021,mackiesander,6," One thing I just can't get over..
","Acting was great, the concept was cool, the pace was fast and tense and exciting and honestly the cgi was so naturalistic and beautifully done, that I think the cgi alone makes this movie worth watching. BUT *spoilers ahead* I had so many issues with the basic logic in the plot. Once future Muri dies, basically nothing made any sense to me. Chris Pratt bringing the toxin back in time would erase future Muri's timeline regardless of what he did with the toxin so he was never going to be able to go back there. I had assumed the whole time that their plan was to bring the toxin back in time and then just kill the aliens with it when they showed up in Chris's timeline and then just solve the problem for humanity as a whole because of course Muri's timeline will never be saved because that's not how the writers decided time travel works. But of course, then Chris Pratt just kept telling us how he's going to go back to future muri and save those 500,000 people instead of the other 8 billion, or about how ""he's running out of time"" to stop the frozen aliens who we very well know aren't going to wake up for another 30 years, and god damn him just running in to their space ship blindly and trying to take them on with their small ragtag crew instead of spending some portion of their next 30 safe years planning how to deal with the aliens safely just was like wait what!! Stop! Bring more people at the very least! Everyone in the world was convinced that ""people from the future came back and need help fighting aliens"" but they're not going to believe that you found those aliens in a glacier??????????????? And I love how the toxin that was supposed to save humanity killed like 6 of the aliens in total, and they wound up just blowing the spaceship up instead.",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2021,alanhowden-86367,1," Painfully stupid
",The special effects and in this movie are good. A lot of money went into this and it is clearly well made.,/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2021,tinus-13,5," No money left to hire a writer.
","Looks good, shame about the rampant stupidity. There are excellent science fiction writers out there but somehow they never get hired for these movies.",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2021,davidmvining,2," Contradictory and Really Stupid
","This was excessively stupid. It honestly feels like it was written by AI, not a human. It has all the pieces you expect from a large-budgeted scifi action vehicle starring an established action star, but nothing makes any sense, the emotional catharsis is completely manufactured and feels incredibly fake while being entirely unearned, and it veers wildly from intentionally silly to unintentionally hilarious without a single sense that anyone involved in the movie has any sense of tone in the least. But hey, stuff blew up good and the music swelled at the end, so it felt like a good time, I guess.",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2021,FeastMode,4," another streaming movie fail
","I don't think this has happened to me before. I watched two thirds of the movie, thought it was a flawed but enjoyable sci-fi flick and was ready to wrap up and give it 6 stars. I felt it was on par with the better streaming movies.",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2021,pushanbanerjee,6," Is what the trailer says
","An action movie! Aliens, things blowing up, people with guns shooting em from endless magazines. On a Sunday afternoon, with a glass of wine, this is perfect. And Chris Pratt is cool as usual. I watched this for some no nonsense fun. It delivers. Plot holes the size of the 7 oceans aside.",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,Paynebyname,4," Started interesting and then took a slow dive into banality
",So the film started off okay with an interesting premise and a solid dad/daughter angle.,/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2021,paul_haakonsen,7," Good old fashioned fast-paced man vs alien fun...
","Now, as I sat down to watch the 2021 action sci-fi movie ""The Tomorrow War"", I was told not to expect too much from the movie, and that it was a watchable but shallow movie experience.",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2021,bnewman-81938,4," YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?
","Amazon paid $200 million for THIS? I wonder what they would pay for a GOOD movie? Amazon got ripped off, because this movie sucked! $200,000,000 for one lousy movie! I wonder how many small houses that money could build for homeless vets?",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," The critics went too hard on this fun sci-fi adventure ride.
","It wasn't epic, complex or extraordinary, but it was great, super entertaining, and easy on the brain. And considering this was an overall impressive, well put together story - only the 3rd ever writing credit for newb Zach Dean, it shines in comparison to many other films I've seen lately written by seasoned filmmakers e.g. Soderbergh's No Sudden Move.",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,kyrross,5," clich√© action pack nonsense
","You have heard those dialogs and one liner in every popcorn action flick from the last 30 years. ''I will be back'' / ''Now, what we do?... We kill them all (smirk)'' / ''Lets finish this'' / ''I will not let you die'' .. and so on.",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2021,kskmah,3," What is with these movies these days?
","Bullets, missiles, fire can kill or hurt these aliens. So why and how can you lose the war? Even terminators couldn't kill everyone, but these monster aliens can wipe every human off the planet? They have to create something to kill the aliens? No, just use the pre mentioned weapons. But that isn't even the stupid problem. The daughter wants the Dan to bring the cure back to his time to prevent the war from even happening? But he doesn't want to leave her to die? WTF? If he goes back in time and prevents the war, that future war won't even exist anymore. WTF is wrong with the writers? Are they just too lazy or too stupid? A lot of these recent movies are really stupid. 1 star for action, 1 star for acting and 1 for the cgi.",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2021,felix-35958,7," Entertaining. That's all I needed.
","I like the actors, aliens, CGI, music, and action. Also, I am glad there were no social issues forced into the movie. Every time I try to watch some series Holyweirdos put some agenda in it. Even with plot holes this movie is entertaning.",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2021,deloudelouvain,8," Don't pay too much attention to negative reviews if you like entertaining sci-fi movies.
","After reading a lot of negative reviews I still gave this movie a shot because by experience I know I hardly every agree with these reviews when it's about a movie in this genre, that is science fiction/action. And I'm glad I didn't pay too much attention to those reviews from people that are very hard to please or that just are eternally unsatisfied. The Tomorrow War is exactly what I expected, a lot of non-stop action (yes there's a lot of shooting), a story that looks far fetched (but then again it's a science fiction so what do you expect?), and a large amount of CGI's. Sounds boring to some but certainly not to me (neither to my wife), certainly not when it's well done like in this movie. The monsters/aliens are great, the computer generated images here are just excellent. The story is very entertaining, and even though the duration of the movie is quite long you never get bored for a second. As for the acting I've never been a big fan of Pratt but credit to him, he did a decent job. As for Yvonne Strahovski, which did a terrific job in The Handmaid's Tale, where she plays a character you can't help hating, she this time plays a totally different character and it was good again. So in short, The Tomorrow War is a perfect movie if you like sci-fi, good CGI's, and need to relax for a couple of hours with a bucket of popcorn and mindless action.",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2021,AzSumTuk,1," I'm sorry, but this is insultingly stupid
","I've liked dumber movies, but I've rarely felt as offended by a bunch of movie characters' stupidity as I was while I was watching this movie.",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2021,007Waffles,7," Entertaining
",It's an entertaining movie with a story that makes you scratch your head because it just doesn't make sense. It's actually ridiculous. But the action and the aliens keep you engaged and Chris Pratt does a good job as an action hero.,/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,genisis_tp,7," Sit Back & Relax, your weekend popcorn entertainer is here!!
","Nothing fancy here, no wow factors, no unexpected scenes, infact we have seen this all many times in many movies but you know what, its still managed to keep my interest for over 2 hours.",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2021,baller-88013,3," Travelers from future should have stopped this movie from happening
","I understand the need to make these blockbuster films with great action sequences, but studios (Amazon in this case) have not learned that the audiences have become sophisticated these days. This movie would have been cool to watch in the 90s. Not anymore.",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2021,eddie_baggins,2," A high profile misfire
","One of Amazon Prime's highest profile original releases yet with a price tag of $200 million in production costs and a premise that would usually suggest a bout into cinema screens around the world, there's been a significant amount of hype and marketing surrounding the lead up to The Tomorrow War being available to stream into lounge-rooms across the globe but sadly this Chris Pratt lead sci-fi action flick is a DOA with a daft premise and lame execution that ensures this bloated mess of a film has zero chance of succeeding.",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,gnatsong,1," Who writes this crap?
",And why do your twenty round clips hold 3000 rounds? The whole premise of this movie is absurd. The acting is mechanical. The dialogue bounces between tear jerker and faux heart felt. There wasn't a character in this movie I cared about. Do I have to give it a whole star?,/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,paul-allaer,4," OK action scenes but disastrous cringe-worthy dialogues sink the movie
","As ""The Tomorrow War"" (2021 release; 138 min.) opens, a bunch of soldiers fall out of the sky, landing into an all-out war zone. We then go to ""28 Years Earlier, December 2022"", and we get to know Dan Forester, who has served in two combat tours in Iraq years ago. As Dan and his family and friends are watching a soccer game in Brazil on TV, all of the sudden soldiers fall out of the sky in the soccer field, and one of them implores the audience: ""We are you 30 years from now! We need you to fight with us!"" And with that, the stakes couldn't be higher: literally the end of human kind is in the balance... At this point we are 10 min. Into the film.",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2021,cricketbat,8," The last part is a little weak, but the overall ride is fun
","While the concept of The Tomorrow War is pretty far-fetched, it still pulled me in. I started to feel the same sense of helplessness the characters were feeling. The visual effects in this movie were well done, too-both the realistic aspects and the more fantastical. There was a point in this movie when I felt the story should have ended, but it kept going, and the film got weaker after that point, but I still enjoyed the overall ride.",/review/rw7547302/?ref_=tt_urv
