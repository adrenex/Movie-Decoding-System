","I never herd the term Duff before and I don't know if it exist in real culture, but it made for a humorous movie. ",/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2020,brookenichole-98054,10," Wonderful!
","The Duff is one of the best teen movies I have ever seen! It conveys this amazing message about learning to love yourself. Duff is just a word but the meaning is impactful. Mae Whitman is perfect as Bianca. She's witty and fun as she portrays a girl who is trying to make it through high school. Robbie Amell was also great as the love interest. He learned to fall for the real her.
Overall this movie will make you smile and laugh.",/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2015,rannynm,8," Hilarious, yet deep. And, worthy of a second viewing
","The comedic movie, The Duff, is hilarious, relatable and worth watching. The film is about high-school senior Bianca, played by Mae Whitman, who finds out that she is the DUFF (Designated Ugly Fat Friend) of her attractive group of friends. Determined to change her DUFF image and impress her crush Toby, she turns to her popular neighbor Wesley Rush, played by Robbie Amell, to give her a complete makeover. Through her journey of transformation, she gains self confidence and shows the school that everybody is a DUFF. ",/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2019,eviltwit73,7," More than Watchable.
","Without the chemistry btw its two leads, this movie would not have worked. Plus, the supporting cast of adults helped. This movie was better than it had any right to be.",/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2020,MrAwesome1022,7," Quite A Pleasant Experience
","The Duff is another movie in the expansive Teen RomCom, but it stands out for its charm, message, and how the plot is delivered. Is it perfect? No. However, Mae Whitman (Bianca) is charming throughout, Robbie Amell (Wesley) does good work, and Ken Jeong (Mr. Arthur) nails every scene he's in. Bianca Santos (Casey), Skyler Samuels (Jess), and Bella Thorne (Madison Morgan) play their roles effectively. Allison Janney (Dottie) also does well with her role.",/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2020,Jerique,7," A wholesome comedy
","In this tale which seems to take elements from Easy A and A Walk to Remember, Bianca (Mae Whitman) is told by her long-time neighbor and classmate, Wesley (Robbie Arnell) that she is the Designated Ugly Fat Friend (or DUFF for short).",/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2015,ArchonCinemaReviews,6," Not the next ""Mean Girls"" by any means but funny and entertaining enough

","Very cliched , high school teen comedy which surprisingly entertained me . the story has a freshness , the leads have actual chemistry , kind-of new presentation keeps you smiling .",/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2020,bunbuneary,10," Heart-warming story!
",The premise of the movie might be a little cliche. But it definitely brings back the 90s movie vibe where things are simple yet heart warming. You might also get an epiphany after the movie! A duff? Who me? Omg!,/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2015,Aktham_Tashtush,7," Funny purposeful movie ... recommend indeed :)
","It's a fresh idea ,, new definitions and it's kinda purposeful which makes it a bit exciting .. not the type of comedy where you laugh your A$$ off ,, but it has more than a bunch of funny bits which made it fine in that area. Ken Jeong appearance was one of the few of scenes that intrigued me to keep on watching the movie, Hilarious man.. to be fair ,, this project would look so much better as a TV movie or probably as a series on CBS, and it could hit huge success, but the idea of series based on these type of stories is not really new on TV (like ""Awkward"" 6 seasons so far on MTV which is a success),, the plot seemed entangled but it went toward a clear goals .. the writing looked okay ,, tight in some parts but still it didn't help much to cover some holes in the production as there were a couple of still scenes in the mid of the movie.",/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2016,Fudge-3,7," Yep, it's another feel good high school movie
","Fortunately the trailer teaches us what DUFF means because otherwise no one would know. It's that approachable guy in your group of friends who no one cares about but is useful for inter-group communications. You didn't ever know anyone like that? Me neither, go figure. But, as a film mechanic it works.",/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2015,Garcwrites,6," Sits right on the edge of being awesome
","The DUFF is quite entertaining and has a really nice poignant message. The film captures life, I mean the characters, and I'm mostly referring to Wesley (Robbie Amell) and Bianca (Mae Whitman), are realistic, humanized. I got a weird sense that I was watching people I knew and not a stereotypical film version of them. The movie has that documentary feel to it and it's due to how the leads portrayed their characters and how easy it is to relate to them.",/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2019,muamba_eats_toast,6," Average fun
",Tbh when I saw the name of the film I presumed it was about a pregnant girl. Never the less it's a good enough high school comedy coming of age film. Nothing new or special but there's enough laughs to get by and it's a heartwarming enough story. Fits the bill for a quiet night in not paying complete attention with a takeaway perfectly.,/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2015,zardoz-13,8," Easy B
","The captivating ""Pygmalion"" comedy ""The DUFF"" revitalizes the standard-issue, romantic, high school, makeover movie. No, I haven't read Kentucky-native Kody Keplinger's 2010 novel that she wrote while she attended high school. Nevertheless, freshman director Ari Sandel and ""Bandslam"" scenarist Josh A. Cagan appear to have infused their adaptation of Keplinger's yarn with the wit, charm, and sophistication reminiscent of classics such as John Hughes' ""The Breakfast Club"" (1985) and Amy Heckerling's ""Clueless"" (1995). Most makeover comedies are so lame they are mediocre. Prime examples include 1987's ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and 1999's ""She's All That."" Moreover, the superlative makeover movie parody ""Not Another Teen Movie"" (2001) subjected the genre to devastating ridicule. Although ""The DUFF"" appropriates most of the usual conventions and clich√©s, the characters emerge as more interesting, the predicaments more stimulating, and the humor more imaginative. While our sympathetic but iconoclastic senior class heroine is negotiating the complex social order maze, ""The DUFF"" compounds her problems, pitting her against cyber-bullies who exploit the social media technology to insult, humiliate, and destroy her because she represents a threat. No, this frivolous, PG-13 rated, frolic doesn't plumb the appalling depths of ""Disconnect"" (2012) where callous cyber bullies drove a sensitive teen to commit suicide. Comparatively, our heroine packs considerably more pluck than the unfortunate ""Disconnect"" protagonist, and she survives everything with which her ruthless adversaries assault her.",/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2015,Harbinger_3781,8," A little review on the characters from The D.U.F.F
","Hmm. I gave this movie an eight... probably because the topic synchronizes with the current age and mind sets I'm in. The comedy, the acting, and especially the casting choices contributed to the eight. For now I won't talk about the plot, because they'll *definitely* give out spoilers, so I'll just chat about some of the stand out casts.",/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2018,SwollenThumb,7," Feel Good Entertainment
","I enjoy watching teen movies to see what the young generation is up to. This movie gives the modern sensibility on final year high school students wading through the confusing labyrinth of romance and dating mingled with the vicissitudes of friendship. All with the absence of any help from adults, who generally are causing more stress than they are helping out. Feel good entertainment even if there is a little too much voice-over needed to explain what Bianca is going through.",/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv

24 February 2016,kosmasp,7," Mean people
","A teenage movie that obviously will play out one way or another depending on whether you like those or not. It's pretty witty and it has some genuine jokes in it (not to mention some very funny supporting cast to boot with). The story itself is as in many cases, very predictable. You know who the real ""target"" of affection is going to be.",/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2019,nogodnomasters,8," TO THE POINT OF NEEDING HELMETS
","Bianca (Mae Whitman), Casey (Bianca A. Santos) and Jess (Skyler Samuels) are three BFFs. Bianca is the smart one and at 14 minutes into the film she realizes she is a ""DUFF"" (Designated Ugly Fat Friend) which is certainly better than being a BUFF (Big Ugly Fat F@#$) although she doesn't like the role even though she is neither fat or ugly.",/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv

28 June 2015,sarah-lou_12,2," I just couldn't believe it.
","The Duff is just another filed attempt by film makers to make a movie from what was actually a great book. There were so many things wrong with this film that I don't even know where to start. The book was about how stereotyping is a pile of crap, yet the film strove to make stereotypes out of the characters. They made Wesley stupid and all about his body, they made Bianca 'awkward' and socially inept, they made Casey and Jessica look shallow and self-obsessed, and worst of all, they made Toby into an indie, guitar playing dreamboy with long hair. All the characters were meant to be AVERAGE (except maybe Wesley, who was meant to be particularly attractive), because the message of the book was that stereotypes don't exist and everyone is actually leading really similar lives and you shouldn't judge. I basically hate this movie and all that it stands for. If I could, I would give it a zero, because I was so disappointed that the makers of it had A* material to work with, real characters and real talk about the world, and they made it just another teen movie.",/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2015,The_Film_Cricket,," A cute comedy burdened by a repugnant ideology that it never overcomes.
","The hurt on Bianca's face is appropriate the day she is informed by an otherwise good friend that her place in the high school pecking order is to be ""The DUFF"" - The Designated Ugly Fat Friend, meaning that she is the friend that other girls keep around to make themselves look more attractive. ""It's not like a big deal, every group has one"" he says, ""You know the one who doesn't look as good , thus making their friends look better."" Placed in such a mean-spirited and unfair distinction fills Bianca, reasonably, with anger and resentment. It is therefore perfectly reasonable that the guy who gives her this information gets a drink thrown in his face.",/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2015,westsideschl,2," Title describes the film.
","If you like this well worn, over written, formula script about high school cliques judging one another with the usual dust-ups then you're still stuck at some below juvenile level of superficiality. The usual range of stereotyping roles - cute, smart, ugly, athlete, musical, nerd, stupid teachers/administrators, lost parents or trying to be cool parents, etc. If you like this film because you're enamored with certain actors then get a life. Acting, dialogue, cinematography, script all appropriate to the title - DUFF.",/review/rw3261728/?ref_=tt_urv
