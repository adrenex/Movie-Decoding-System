8 January 2021,RMurray847,8," One of the toughest films I've ever tried to review. I liked it a lot, but can't recommend it.
","This is a very difficult movie to review without major spoilers. I can either just say ""spoiler alert"" and then promptly ruin the whole thing. Or I can be circumspect, and perhaps not tell as much as would be satisfying. I'm going to take approach #2, because in the end, I would hate to go into this movie having had someone ""explain"" it to me first.",/review/rw3808286/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2018,TxMike,," Aronofsky takes us on a wild journey with the house as the world allegory.
","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library, my wife skipped. I was eager to see this, I had heard so much about it. ",/review/rw3808286/?ref_=tt_urv

18 September 2017,Farshnoshket,10," Insane, beautiful, terrorizing, epic, puzzling, intoxicating, gross, masterful. (Spoilers)
","First, I must laugh at all the reviews of people who had no idea what they were watching. We must all realize that all films are not written for all people who watch. Just as I usually do not go see cartoon films, others should give good thought before seeing such an 'artsy' film as Mother!. Hey, if you didn't like Black Swan, think more than twice on this one.",/review/rw3808286/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2018,joebloggscity,3," Religious allegories abound but really it's just pretentious nonsense
","Now I'm not one to disparage the director, I liked Requiem for a Dream and loved Black Swan, but this is a stinker and just simply boring. It's all just packed full of cod biblical allegories spread thickly throughout which tries to twist between different types of horror genres, but leaved me unintrigued.

19 September 2017,wasabiteabag,10," My god, mother is one hell of a film.

11 September 2017,bzarras,6," Thick on analogies and symbolism, to the point of overkill
","I saw this at TIFF and the point this movie was trying to make became clear fairly early on. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but as the story developed, the analogies and symbolism went into overkill, to the point where their excessive nature diminished what was an interesting story.",/review/rw3808286/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2018,BandSAboutMovies,4," Hilarious!
","Know someone who said that mother! was a movie that he warned people against seeing because of its subject matter and wondered if it should even be made. And then, I know people who fell in love with the film, lavishing it with praise. Still, others were shocked by its violence or upset by its biblical imagery. Me? I thought it was pretty funny.",/review/rw3808286/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2017,jtindahouse,8," A little tedious to watch, but the concept is brilliant
","Some people would say you have to be a genius to make films like Darren Aronofsky does. I would also add to that that you have be a genius to watch and appreciate his films. By the end of 'Mother!' I felt like I had been hit by a truck. The film is almost hypnotic in the way it beats you to your knees and keeps you there for the entire run time. It's a film that almost doesn't want to be liked if that makes sense. The less you like it, the better it has done its job.",/review/rw3808286/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2017,aciessi,9," Moab (Mother of all Box-Office Bombs)
","These days, we live in a world where most things are terrible and don't make any sense. Yet, a film like Mother! can still come along and disgust audiences. A film so off-putting, Rex Reed declared it ""The worst film of the century"". Make no mistake, Mother! is a profoundly polarizing film. But that is only because it went mainstream. It stars mainstream actors. It's distributed by Paramount. In recent years, the art-house and the multiplex have never crossed paths. But as the era of the blockbuster fades away, it was only a matter of time for Hollywood to return back to it's roots. To bring us back to the late 1960's, where most films meant something. Films that grab you. Films that push serious boundaries. I rarely leave a theater shaken. But Mother! did just that. It is a beautiful, terrifying assault on your senses.",/review/rw3808286/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2017,TheLittleSongbird,4," The weirdness of 'Mother!' has to be seen to be believed
","'Mother!' is a perfect example of a film that raises such high hopes with one of the best and most disturbing trailers (every bit as much as the trailer for 'IT') of the year, yet turns out to be the complete anti-thesis in quality making it one of the most disappointing, and to me the strangest, films of the year.",/review/rw3808286/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2017,tigerfish50,1," From Eden to Armageddon in 2 Hours
","Darren Aronofsky invariably produces a flaccid fiasco when he tries to show off his intellectual potency, and 'Mother' is no exception. From the opening scene, which depicts a young female waking alone in the bedroom of an isolated country house, he sets the Pretentiousness dial at 11. The woman's husband is absent, so she wanders about in an agitated state searching for him. After he's found, their wooden conversation reveals he's a middle-aged poet with writer's block. Later that day, a stranger knocks at the door, and the poet invites him to stay after learning he's a fan of his work. The next morning, the visitor's wife arrives - soon followed by a pair of bickering sons.",/review/rw3808286/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2017,nogodnomasters,4," Out, damned spot! Out!
","The film opens with a fire with what appears to be Jennifer Lawrence's face in it. We next see her rebuilding the house that was destroyed. Her husband (Javier Bardem) is a poet with writer's block. A man (Ed Harris) who is also a fan comes to visit and stays, his wife shows up and things escalate until I thought I was watching a bad production of "".....Virginia Woolfe."" Mother takes meds for her stress which is symbolically shown as a spot on the floor which comes through the rug. The stress level escalates until it is inane and unbelievable to the point she is cursed at and disrespected in her own house.",/review/rw3808286/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2018,sherripadgitt-55536,1," WTF!
","Seriously wtf did I just watch? I get it, I get the comparison about the mother nature-god-adam-eve+ references, but that doesn't help the film out to realize this. This was just really brutal to watch. I almost didn't finish it, but I was already in sh**-deep so I had to go there. My advice...don't waste your time....seriously, you will most likely regret it.",/review/rw3808286/?ref_=tt_urv

17 September 2017,paul-allaer,3," Hints of Rosemary's Baby but nowhere near as good as that classic
","""Mother!"" (2017 release; 125 min.) brings the story of a couple living in a remote house. The woman wakes up, but her husband is up and about already. We later learn that he is a well-known writer but suffering from writer's block, and that she is restoring the house room by room. Then out of the blue a man comes knocking on the door and the husband invited him in, even though he doesn't know him. Turns out the guy thought their place was a bed-and-breakfast. To the wife's surprise and dismay, her husband invites the man to stay the night. Then the next morning, the stranger's wife comes knocking at the door... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw3808286/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2021,BlueBirdsForever,2," a disappointment
","It's so metaphorical that the movie itself - without the metaphor - makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Those who know about this may enjoy it, but for those, who actually want to see something that makes sense (in itself), I have bad news.",/review/rw3808286/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2018,Kirpianuscus,," magnificent
","It is a parable. And one of the most impressive films of the last decade. A film about poetry, poetry itself, and about people. About art. And about intincts and sheep spirit and religion , illusion and blind freedom. A film who you must see. Because it is about each from us, its public. Symbols and violence and fear and profound vulnerability. A manifesto more than a masterpiece. Great performances and a so, so clear message. As warning . And as verdict. But, more important, as precise definition of the near reality. Sure, a Darren Aronofovsky film. So, far to be comfortable. But it has the virtue to be exactly what you looking for. Great cinematography, admirable performances and the right lesson about present.Short, a magnificent work.",/review/rw3808286/?ref_=tt_urv

Jennifer acts well but what a waste of talent. Javier as some fame whore is convincing but what on earth for?
