19 May 2022,xbarracx,1," I USED to love anything Ghost Adventures
","Update - I saw the 3rd episode ""Auburn In Hell"" and must admit this shows getting bad quick. What a horrible 3rd episode! Whoever is picking these locations and people to investigate should be fired. And is Bagans going to seriously just FaceTime the group every episode? That was another horrible idea. This show started good but now sucks. The lady in s1e3 is a horrible actor and it's blatantly obvious everything happening is fake. You'd think they would try a little harder making it seem authentic. Huge let down. If I happen to watch the next episode I may update this but I doubt it will change. I was a GA fan but that's starting to change if this is what they turn into.",/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2022,laineyd-15587,3," Not impressed. Zak is too full of himself
","Zak can't even bother to show up, he just phones in his performance and makes everyone else do the work.",/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2022,asharmbers,5," A little respect goes a long way
","This looked promising, but alas. I think this crew need to sit down one night together, watch 3 x their early episodes, then watch a couple of the latest ones and see if they too can see whats happened to them.",/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2022,luise911,1," Rubbish
",I gave up on this halfway through episode one. The 'investigators' decided almost immediately they were dealing with a demonic entity without any real proof and after that it was just the usual of Zac feeling angry (via zoom!) and Aaron getting totally over excited while trying to antagonise whatever was in the house. If I was a ghost I would have been p**sed off and acted out too!,/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2022,ParanormalPrincess,1," Horrible concept and I don't like the editing!!
","I'm truly disappointed with this new spin off series, between the filters used on their faces when talking through video to the poor editing it's not good. Zak is also not present and speaks through audio like he's the wizard of Oz behind a screen screaming at others what to do. Ugh, used to be a fan not anymore.",/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,timurtaimur,6," It's GA without Zak
",This show is essentially another series of Ghost Adventures except they're visiting locations suggested by viewers.,/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2022,ajproductio,1," Totally Fake
",I have been doing Paranormal Investigation for many years. And I used tonwatch your show to see what is real or fake. Well show is completely fake. The first two new episodes of your house call show. Was some what okay. But the the third is completely fake. The lady Melissa is a a fantastic actress but a complete liar. I have been to many different locations after you all posted and episodes of your ghost adventures. A few of them I do get some communication with the spirits. And get answers. But a lot of your other locations were all bullshit... People pay attention to a lot of Zaks Videos. And your will see and can tell how much lies they are saying. I think the only real way for the world to see if your show is real would be to have me and my team do a true investigation with you. So they can see that it's just a show and not all of itn is true!!!! Sorry I have to let the world know the truth!,/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2022,jon-stokes21-539-17875,8," These Were Always My Favorite Shows To Begin With!
","Read a lot of these reviews and nearly didn't watch the series. I'm amazed how board people are they spend their free time (I don't have that sort of extra time) watching shows they know they're going to hate or dislike or have the intensions of calling it ""fake"" before they even tuned in to watch the show. These shows (ghost and paranormal shows) aren't for everyone, I get that. However, if you do enjoy ghost paranormal shows this is among the most entertaining PERIOD! Continue to read and you'll see I'm not even the biggest fan of Zak Bagans, yet despite his annoyance, the show still flows very well, I don't believe for a second those telling the stories unquestionably believe what they're experiencing is real. The question is, is it in their heads?",/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2022,biggguix,3," These houses
",OMG why are people seeing ghost always live in such poor conditions. The last one (s01e08) was terrible. These people have other issues to be fixed first. There is less and less happening with every episode. Really hard to watch.,/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2022,mchawk,2," Poorly done
",Each episode so far features families below the poverty line who excuse cases of domestic violence as paranormal.,/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,steampunk-30286,3," It's ok
","I've been a fan of all ghost hunting type shows since I was a child and Ghost Adventures used to be a favorite until it seemed to become more scripted, with a lot more acting. I also really don't like the provoking... from other shows I've watched, provoking really isn't a great idea and can often make things worse. Season 1 ep 1, my issues with this series began from the start when they automatically assumed a demonic entity without actual proof and then proceeded to provoke. If the couple in this episode really were experiencing things in their home that seemed malevolent, I'm sure the team just escalated it and left the couple with it. It makes me angry for them.",/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,krystler-81734,1," Not a fan
","I loved the old ghost adventures, the new house call ones are stupid, Zack isn't even there and they in no way help the people. Yes they investigate and get their evidence, but then just leave. The poor people are still left with no answers on how to help.",/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2022,sarahbabii-59934,1," Kind of sad
","I watched all of the episode one now this is kind of sad. I've always liked Zak Bagans. I've always been interested in the paranormal I'm an empath. Compared to his other shows I was really excited thinking that he's going to start helping people you know he's going to be working with people and trying to help them through their paranormal problems. At the end of the episode I'm like okay what's he going to tell them to do. The first thing he said without any emotion was, "" can you guys move?"" Then second he says, "" maybe you guys should go find a priest and have them do an exorcism."" So he literally went to these people's house stirred up all this activity for what for views for ratings and then doesn't even seem like he cares to help them? I'm so disappointed I don't know what happened to him but I just feel like this is wrong. If you're going to go in there and stir s*** up and leave them to deal with the aftermath at least act like you're concerned and come up with a game plan on how they might be able to resolve the issue not just say oh can you guys move.. really disappointed.",/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2022,JavaJaney,10," Gimme More!
","While there have been some interesting haunts at businesses, it's always the house visits I care more about. Helping families is so important. I really, really hope they keep this show going.",/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2022,janinebrock,5," how are they helping
","I would really love to see them try to help the family. It seems like they are only confirming presences...but not giving information or help in actually helping these families. Honestly, I would be even more terrified of living there and scared of not knowing how to fix the actual problem. I love watching the evidence but am concerned for the families. It is also REALLY weird that Zak is never there. We all started watching the show as we loved Zak but not having him on site is very odd. Is he ever going to come on calls? Still love Aaron but miss Zak. Love the one that shows the stick figures. Please work on making this better because it could be great.",/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2022,flowerstardust1979,10," Refreshing Change
","Their house investigations and helping families have always been my favourite episodes so I was really happy to hear about this show. A refreshing change from 20 plus seasons of visiting random places, which I still enjoy bit I'm definitely enjoying this more. Hopefully this show will continue past this 1st series.",/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2022,cbjami,10," I LOVE THIS SHOW!!
",This is the best. When most of these ghost hunting shows started they were in private homes. Then they went to big commercial type settings or old mansions. In small private homes is where the fun starts and the viewer can relate to. Great job Zak that you saw this was missing from the many many ghost shows on TV now. Thats why you are the number one presenter of these types of shows.,/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2022,dcmajapan,10," Really Like It
","This is the ""type"" of paranormal show I like. Nothing bores me more than teams investigating the same massive abandoned buildings (Prisons, Sanitariums, Factories, Hospitals, B&Bs...etc.). I like the personal back story / property history of a real family. One can always argue ""Fake,"" ""Staged,"" etc., which is why the research and interviews are critical IMHO. Hope it comes back.",/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2022,hazelangeleyesxo,10," THIS is what ghost adventures should always be
","I love this show! Having them go to ppls homes is much more powerful, personal, in a much smaller space, and these ppl need real help. It's much better than watching them go these big buildings with a long haunted history, other paranormal teams check out, and it's basically just verifying activity for themselves. There's something so different about ppl being affected in their own homes who need real help. I hope they keep it this way and its not just a one season deal.",/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2022,brentonmcdonald,3," Sad it got trashy

10 July 2022,andrewcook-10810,," Zak is affraid
",Zak is affraid of flying due to an encounter with a demon that pretty much told him the next time he flies will be his last. That's why he doesn't appear on the east coast episodes.,/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2022,montcodogwalker,10," I LOVE THIS!!
",These types of house call episodes on ghost adventures were always my favorite..glad there's a whole series out of it now. Just wish zak would be there in person!,/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2022,ttay-48248,3," Boring with a side of zoom
","This series is really stupid. I've tried to watch two episodes but I just can't with this zoom call crap of Zak being at ""headquarters"" while he send his team out to these house calls. Zak seems to be a bigger ___ than he was on the regular ghost adventures show when it comes to telling his team what HE wants to see / hear from them. He is trying to do things through Zoom calls and it just so ridiculous to see a show like this. The team doesn't have all of the equipment (from the two shows I watched) to contact ghost(s). To me, enough is enough if you can really find true haunting and scary locations with REAL ghosts then move on and do something else.",/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2022,qhrzsmc,10," Refreshing Change and still Ghost Adventures
",It's definitely still Ghost Adventures and the evidence never fails to impress. The refreshing change is having Lauren investigate. She's the perfect subtle change that lends to the show another perspective. Her quiet and believable demeanor is exactly what I feel the show needed. She's not the girly girl shouting. She's the best friend you'd take because she will keep you calm and collected. Lover her!,/review/rw8288701/?ref_=tt_urv
