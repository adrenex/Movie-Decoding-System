5 January 2022,statuskuo,8," The American Underdog Wins Big
","I am only 4 years younger than Kurt Warner. And saw the path of which caused one of the most electrifying quarterbacks in American football history. I recall watching him zip a football so fast the camera couldn't follow. Corny as it may sound, I saw a guy who was desperate to win. Throughout the championship season, I kept hearing how in arena football there are no first downs. That this training embedded in Warner caused a massive shift in how we consume the sport. That the ""west coast offense"" overtook the ground and pound of previous years. His level of play stood out. It is also a credit to head coach Dick Vermeil (played here by Dennis Quaid) allowed this style of play to take over. Never mind the ball buster which was offensive coordinator Mike Martz (whom I kept thinking what a disaster of a head coach he was).",/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," Wow, what an incredible true-story.
","As a huge NFL fan, I had heard of Warner, but had no clue about his story. This is clearly one of the best real-life underdog stories. The directing was decent, but the writing was a little slow and stale. It needed more action and suspense, and less happy-go-lucky vibes. The 112 min runtime and slow pacing really made the film feel dragged out. The casting and performances were spot-on and convincing, and although a fan of Zachary Levi (especially in Shazam!), I think his overly happy and smiling demeanor was too much to play Warner's character. I kept expecting to hear him yell Shazam! Nevertheless, he acted his heart out, as did Anna Paquin. Still, an amazing and emotional story (have the tissues nearby) and I'm really glad I watched it. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me.",/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2022,kenzibit,8," Unique plot.
","Powerful, this is just solid. A very inspirational story that will make you tear up....a story that is so rare and unique in football. Perfectly performed by great actors. Highly recommend this for the sport fans.",/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv

","Get the tissues - American Underdog will make even the most stone face man let go... Best sports themed feel-good movie I've EVER seen (and I see a LOT of movies)! Second only to CODA this year in the feel good category at large, which might very well be the best of all time. It was a memorable year for feeling good watching movies üëè.",/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2022,trinaboice,10," Inspiring, true underdog sports flick
","IN A NUTSHELL:
I know I'm late to this party. This sports movie based on a true story was actually released over a month ago, but I haven't had time to watch it until now. I'm so glad I was finally able to see it. It's one of those underdog sports movies that we've seen many times before, but they always make you want to try a little harder in your life and go for your dreams. It definitely fits into the underdog sports movie formula, yet I never tire of watching that kind of movie.",/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2021,colewaters,10," Fantastic film
",American Underdog is such a fantastic film. The acting is like no other and the cast was a great choice selection. It is definitely a must see film for the whole family.,/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2022,RJBrez,9," Beautifully made, and much better than I thought it'd be
","I was fifteen years old during the 1999 Rams season. I still remember the ""greatest show on turf"" like it was last year, even though it's now been 22 years. The Rams revolutionized the sport that season.",/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2022,ilovefoodcoma,8," So inspiring!

","Andrew and Jon Erwin are Christian film directors, screenwriters and film producers who have made movies such as Woodlawn, I Can Only Imagine, Octover Baby and Mom's Night Out. Andrew says that their goal: ""Our focus is still firmly rooted within the church, but it's focused out. And so our goal is to reach out beyond the church walls to engage a generation that's walking away from the church - as an introduction to Christianity.""",/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2021,peteranft,9," Surprise!
","I have to begin by saying I am a huge NFL fan. But, to my surprise, this was not a movie about the NFL. It is a touching story about an athlete and the strong woman by his side. We often here the words faith, hope, and love in spiritual talks and discussion. What do these words look like in life.... The Warner family. This movie does a nice job at showing the path to success and yes, it comes with trials and tribulations. This was well done.",/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2022,kenstallings-65346,10," Inspirational
","It's a movie that had to be based on a real story, because no one would believe it as a work of fiction. But, in choosing the way the story was presented, the movie touched something even more special than most people would have been aware of.",/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2022,jljacobi,7," Nice tale, good movie. A love story with some football
","Okay, this isn't the best movie technically I've ever seen, but it's a good story that needed to be told and I enjoyed it.",/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2022,masonfisk,7," DOING WHAT HE'S MEANT TO DO...!
","Zachary Levi (from Shazam) stars in the Kurt Warner story (I mean it might as well be called that) as the film traces his struggles from being an unknown Midwestern quarterback hoping to make to the NFL but due to not playing in a big school & not having decent representation (he has to browbeat an agent to back him), he has to make due by stocking shelves in a supermarket but then an entrepreneurial indoor football team owner, played by Bruce McGill, entices him to join up where he finally achieves some state of success (along w/bagging a divorcee w/2 children played by Oscar winner Anna Paquin) but things take a turn when the ST. Louis Rams give him a chance (spearheaded by the coach's, played by Dennis Quaid, belief Levi can make a difference to the team). Not a bad film even though something like 1993's Rudy kind of got here first but it's crowd pleasing, inspirational & w/a dash of sentimental religious rot which will not completely turn off the casual viewer. Also starring Adam Baldwin (from Firefly) as one of Levi's first coaches.",/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv

",Difficult journey and a beautiful destination. Love how the story bring forward family along with football. Original footage from Superbowl is contained which is awesome.,/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2022,sidfargas,," Wonderful Movie!
","This is honestly a film that the entire family should see. Well crafted and inspirational, it's very much old school and what old school Hollywood used to deliver. Kurt Warner's real life story needed this treatment and I can't wait to own this one on dvd. I love that the faith-based aspects made it into the film yet weren't depicted in an over exaggerated or overt manner. This is a love story as much as it is a football story. Not just the love of a man and his wife but for God and his children.",/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2022,jeroduptown,8," Undrafted
",Kurt's story is one of legend in the NFL and this movie capitalizes on it. Casting is spot on. Engaging and excellent for all ages - it's instantly a sports classic.,/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2021,dkaelin-22428,10," Hard to believe.......
","That this guy was bagging groceries and then 3 years later a Super Bowl Champ! Went into this movie thinking it would be some sort of Lifetime Original a-la Kirk Cameron type cheese fest. I was pleasantly surprised at just how good it was. The story line was compelling and the acting was especially fantastic (the little boy who played his step son is really good)! It's a very heart warming story of determination and love. The movie does a very good job of telling Kirt's story of being an ""underdog"" and reaching his dream. It's not boring at all and the football action is very realistic. It's definitely one of the better sports movies I've seen in a very long time.",/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2021,naturenomad,10," Just the kind of movie we all need right now! AMAZING!
","I am not a sports or football fan, nor have I ever heard of Kurt Warner, but his journey is the kind of cinematic soul food we all need at the moment when the world is turned upside down still.",/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2021,SpiritMechanic,9," Only 3 reviews so far. All with 10 stars. So why is it rated 7.6?
","Being a Christian and almost always being embarrassed by Christian movies,
I was a little nervous going in to see this screening in October. I knew really nothing about Kurt Warner.",/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2022,TheNamelessCzar,4," Should've been a lifetime movie channel movie
","Very hokey, over the top sentimental, cheesy, bland, and overall boring. I'm a huge football fan, but the in your face emotion made me want to surf my phone while the movie was going on. Even the NFL action scenes looked fake. I swear, every actor looked like an over aged, out of shape pretender. Very predictable. Maybe worth a rental if you're a big sports fan and like the lifetime movie network.",/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2021,bryanhandley,10," Prepare to be inspired
","For the most part, most of us know this story. Kurt Warner, NFL SB MVP, NFL MVP, Hall of Famer and never drafted. But this dives so much deeper into the full story",/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,angelapple-41611,10," Best movie in a long time
",This was the best movie we have seen in a long time. It's just proves you don't have to curse or show nudity to make a good movie. Don't give up on your dreams no matter what comes your way persevere. Just do what you have to do until you can do what you want to do.,/review/rw8388627/?ref_=tt_urv
