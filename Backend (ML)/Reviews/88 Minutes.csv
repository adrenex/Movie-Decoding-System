27 February 2016,SnoopyStyle,8," Knightley terrific
",It's 1774 England. Georgiana (Keira Knightley) is arranged by her mother Lady Spencer (Charlotte Rampling) to marry the older Duke of Devonshire William Cavendish (Ralph Fiennes). She is eager for high society but finds him personally cold. He brings in a girl who is probably his bastard child. He is bitter that Georgiana delivers him a girl. She becomes a popular figure. She befriends Lady Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell) who is desperate to get back her children from her abusive husband. The Duke starts an affair with Bess in a long line of many mistresses and he is able to get her back her children. Georgiana starts her own affair with Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper).,/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2010,TheLittleSongbird,7," Visually stunning, if lacking in the story
","I saw this film for the first time this weekend, and overall I liked it a lot. The story is a little uneventful, with some parts feeling as though they were skimmed over(the political life) or only briefly explored, and the pacing can be pedestrian. That said, it is a visual feast really, as the costumes, sets, scenery, cinematography, interiors and even the carriages are spectacular, while the music gives a lovely touch to the proceedings too. The script is well written and gripping, and the direction is fairly good. Kiera Knightley is great as Georgina, really quite dignified, while Ralph Fiennes is perfect as her philandering husband. To conclude, a visually beautiful film. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2009,joestank15,8," Good story. Interesting and mostly believable in presentation.
","The Duchess - Set at the end of the eighteenth century, The Duchess is based on the life of Georgiana Cavendish (Kiera Knightley), Duchess of Devonshire. The film delves into Georgiana's passionate and doomed affair with Earl Grey, the future Prime Minister, and the complex love triangle with her husband (Ralph Fiennes) and Georgiana's best friend, Lady Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell).",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2009,jboothmillard,5," The Duchess
","I think this is one of the only costume dramas I wanted to see purely for the costumes, well, and the leading actress, from director Saul Dibb (Bullet Boy). Set in the 18th Century, this sees Georgiana Spencer (Keira Knightley), an ancestor to Princess Diana, marrying The Duke of Devonshire (Golden Globe nominated Ralph Fiennes) at age 17 to become The Duchess. Adored by the public, the same can't be said about The Duke, who it seems is more interested in having a son that much else, and after two daughters, he feels Georgiana may be unreliable. She meanwhile befriends Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell), who later is found to be a woman that the Duke is betraying her with, but he is insistent that she lives with them, so uncomfortably, they do, even when Georgiana does produce a son. So with the pressure of an unfaithful husband, Georgiana creates public scrutiny, and falls in love with young rising politician Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper). The Duke however is not allowing the affair to continue, even with his own liaison with Lady Bess, and he threatens to take her children away if it continues. So the film ends with Georgiana having her last conversation with Charles, he announces his engagement, but at least she lives happily with the children, and it says in the final text that the Duke married Bess with the blessing of Georgiana. Also starring Charlotte Rampling as Lady Spencer, Simon McBurney as Charles James Fox and Aidan McArdle as Richard Sheridan. Knightley does well as the dignified Duchess, Fiennes may be slightly pantomime villain in his performance, but he still has his moments, and even with not much to recommend, this is not a bad story. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, and it won the BAFTA for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Make Up & Hair. Worth watching!",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv

7 March 2009,Nazi_Fighter_David,8," Saul Dibb presents ""The Duchess"" as an incredibly emotional woman, somebody who has a lust for life
","What rather wonderful about this story is that Georgiana Spencer (Keira Knightley) discovers a way to exult in victory over things and to get back some kind of power in a time where, really, women had very little Being someone of great vitality and liveliness, she was very much a dreamer and an idealist, a woman who loved being the center of attention, who loved the fact at some point that her picture was in the paper, that the clothes were always talked of, that her every move was commented on ",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2008,blackburnj-1,8," An entertaining film which promises much for the future
","The career of Keira Knightley has been somewhat of a mixed bag. She has had strong moments, invariably under the direction of Joe Wright, and she has had her less brilliant moments, mainly in the later ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films. But, in ""The Duchess"", an entertaining and moving portrait of Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire, she truly shows signs that she is coming of age with a performance of subtlety and nuance.",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2008,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," A great period piece, Kiera pulls in a fantastic performance
","I couldn't wait for The Duchess, I am just a huge fan of period pieces and Kiera Knightly is becoming a fantastic actress in this genre. I was looking forward to this film mainly because I studied Georgina a little bit in college for my history class and I always thought she was such an elegant and strong woman that stood out from the others. She was like the Madonna of her day, she had a great sense of style, self, and strength. While the movie is not completely accurate, it still was a fine movie to watch. Kiera truly held her own as Georgina and was absolutely stunning. One of the underlining stories that I appreciate in this film is the battle of the sexes. Ralph Fiennes who plays the Duke of Devonshire does a fantastic job as well and he plays this anti-villain, shows the true side of the pain and pressure men felt but how they looked at women as nothing but property. This story truly touches you and makes you grateful for our present day.",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2008,ekartawick,9," ignore the critics, the duchess is spellbinding
","After reading copious amounts of mediocre reviews for ""The duchess"", I wasn't expecting much from this film. However, from the first scene I was utterly absorbed.",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2008,geoffgee,9," A good story beautifully filmed and with fine performances - especially from Keira Knightly.
","I came away from the cinema after seeing The Duchess feeling I had had my consciousness of what life must have been like for the aristocracy of 18th century England dramatically raised (both literally and metaphorically). The story of Georgiana's marriage unfolds by subtle degrees amidst the most sumptuous of interiors and landscaped gardens - all beautifully filmed and realistically recreated. Apart from the main characters, there appear a rich selection of characters from neighbouring strata of society - aristocrats, political activists, servants and children (as babies and older) both legitimate and illegitimate - all of whom contribute to weaving the screenplay into an immensely fascinating narrative. I was already a fan of both Keira Knightly and Ralph Fiennes before seeing The Duchess, so I was pleased to find that their performances were well up to - and in the case of Ms Knightly even surpassing - my expectations. Even those who aren't normally 'into' period dramas (like me) should, I feel sure, find much to appreciate in this excellent film.",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2019,MazzyMayhem-117-544511,9," Stunning
","This is one of my favourite films of all time. Keira Knightley is superb in this role. Although it may not be wholly accurate, this film clearly shows how badly women (even those of high birth) were treated by men and society. The costumes and settings are delicious. Love love love!",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2008,JamesHitchcock,7," Every man in England is in love with her- except her husband
","The marriage between Lady Georgiana Spencer and William Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire, was an arranged union between two of eighteenth-century England's most powerful aristocratic families. It appears to have been loveless from the start; the Duke was more interested in hunting and his dogs than in his wife, whom he only married so that she might provide him with a son and heir. He took his wife's best friend, Lady Elizabeth Foster, as his mistress; the three lived under the same roof in a ménage a trois. Georgiana threw herself into her own interests- gambling and political campaigning- and eventually took a lover of her own, the handsome young politician (and future Prime Minister) Charles Grey, by whom she had an illegitimate daughter.",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2014,adnarish,5," A question of expectations
","I'm of two minds about this film. On the one hand, Saul Dibb has managed to turn a book into an entertaining film about the trials and tribulation - and, let's keep things in perspective, extremely privileged life - of the frolicking Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire (Keira Knightley). It hits all the targets of the romantic genre, and does so with a nice mix of emotional scenes, witty banter, and even some interesting discussions.",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2008,jaredmobarak,6," Freedom in moderationThe Dutchess
","Keira Knightley's period drama for the year 2008 is a well-crafted one, but lacking in anything new and exciting. The Dutchess is your run-of-the-mill tale of unrequited love amidst the artifice of a marriage of utility. It all begins with a gathering of teenagers, playing their games in the yard while the adults talk inside, planning the futures for their children behind closed doors. When Georgiana's mother tells her how she will be the next Duchess of Devonshire, you are almost shocked at her reaction. So happy and excited that a man could love her after only two meetings, she cannot wait to leave and start her new life  seemingly forgetting all about that boy in the yard for whom she obviously has feelings for. This is a time of regimented rules, of lives orchestrated for success and not allowed to spontaneously evolve. A decision that I don't think she could have said no to anyways just set up her entire life's journey, one full of happiness, wealth, and eventual heartbreak.",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2021,ThomasColquith,9," Underrated Film
","""The Duchess"" is a very good film which probably has not gotten the recognition that it deserves. The cinematography is wonderful, the costumes grand, and the acting top notch. Knightley gives one of her best performances and is well cast, and all of the other actors are great as well. This film is more of a psychological drama between spouses and those around them, so there is not a lot of overt action or business in the plot but that is ok. This is about the inner life of a wealthy couple and how it's not always great. Those on the outside sometimes look on with envy, but the reality is often more grim. Georgina is trapped by a bad husband and a societal structure that gives her few options, but I think that it is also important for the audience to remember her ""suffering"" pales in comparison to what many in the world go through. After all she has food, clothing, money, housing, family, servants, etc. There seem to be many of these historical dramas which seek to show the bondage that even the upper-classes face, especially women. But strictures bind everyone to a degree and again a proper perspective should be maintained. The weak point of this film is that it is a sad story, with the husband so unlikeable, but it still made for a good drama or soap. I rate it a 9/10.",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2008,gradyharp,8," Similar Sagas
","THE DUCHESS (based on Amanda Foreman's book ""Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire"" which in turn was based on historical fact) has been well adapted for the screen by Jeffrey Hatcher, Anders Thomas Jensen and writer/director Saul Dibb. What was basically snubbed by the critics of the theatrical release as a 'fashion show with little else going for it' turns out to be a quite beautiful period drama. The fact that the story is based on the life of the outspoken feminist and political thinker in the late 1700s - Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire - who happens to be an ancestor of Princess Di whose life in many ways paralleled the Duchess, makes it more interesting than most costume dramas. And yet, even without the obvious parallel in stories, this film stands well on its own, due to a smart script and a fine cast. ",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2008,Rave-Reviewer,7," More fun in corsets
","The latest slice of period drama to grace our screens is this biopic on Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who during the 1770s was patroness of the Whig party and prisoner of a marriage which made her, among other things, suffer the indignity of having her husband's mistress living under the same roof. These heritage dramas are an industry all by themselves; the armies of prop hirers, wig and costume makers, researchers, production designers, location scouts and (mostly) British actors who go to make them must find themselves in almost permanent employ. The BBC does them, the Americans have a go at them, and the public can't seem to get enough of them. The Duchess is a superior example of the genre, though nowhere in the league of Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, and combines the spectacle of Keira Knightley looking glamorous in a range of frocks and wigs, while at the same time honing her acting talents (no more those rictus grins), with the guilty pleasure of following the uncomfortable parallels between the fortunes and indiscretions of the ancestress of Lady Diana Spencer with those of the Princess of Wales herself. Lowering over the whole proceedings is the truly superb presence of Ralph Fiennes's Duke of Devonshire, Fiennes an actor who can convey polite discomfiture or threatening ire with slightest twitch of the mouth. In his hands the Duke becomes far less a melodramatic villain than a product of his time, and you almost feel sorry for him. Go and see The Duchess; only those who have had children will balk at the liberties taken with childbirth and breastfeeding. But not even that will spoil the fun.",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv

","a beautiful film. not great or remarkable. only beautiful. for costumes and correct acting. for the light to dark rooms of period. for the flavor of Anna Karenina. and for the atmosphere before the storm. a movie like a jewel from 18 century. more complex than a nice adaptation of a book, almost fascinating for the science of Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes to explore theirs roles possibilities, special for performance of Charlotte Rampling and for the air of portrait of a life. a movie like a drop of perfume. noble, seductive, charming. and a different tool for discover the past in a profound way.that is all. a beautiful film about a special universe and remarkable force of a woman to be herself .",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv

14 September 2008,badajoz-1,3," Princess Diana did not live in the 18th century!
","Another attempt to put real British history and characters on the screen for US audiences, only it does not contain much history - it was a really exciting period politically with loads of REAL characters far more interesting than the Duchess of Devonshire - and is just a tired retelling of parallels with the Charles/Diana/Camilla menage-a-trois done out with a glossy video of the best of UK country houses. Keira Knightley, over-exposed, cannot live up to the demands of being centre stage but does her best. Portrayal of aristocrats in 18th century is laughable, and, as for 'all girls together in a man's world, while I shag your husband'- what a total joke!Let Diana rest in peace!",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2008,MaxBorg89,6," Beautiful to behold, but rather soulless
","When Quentin Tarantino presented Reservoir Dogs at Sundance in 1992, he famously stated that Merchant-Ivory productions were a major turn-off for him, much like on-screen violence could be for someone else. No one else seems to agree with him, though, or at least not openly, since lots of British directors are trying to become the next James Ivory (the real one lost his mojo with The White Countess, which also marked his last collaboration with the late producer Ismail Merchant). And while Joe Wright hit the jackpot with Pride & Prejudice and Atonement, his colleague Saul Dibb doesn't fare as well with The Duchess, an elegant but frigid costume drama which fails to be particularly dramatic.",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2020,circagirl,9," Amazing performance from Kiera Knightly
","I thought Kiera was one of those actresses you call in to duck-bill her lips and look hot but she proved her chops in this. She really brings out the pain, heartbreak, and at turns, the enduring spirit and humor of the Duchesd of Devonshire. Her marriage was the dictionary definition of a gilded cage and there wasn't a moment I didn't want to reach in and slap her husband. The film attempts to humanize him at points, implying that he might be just as trapped by the imperial system, but it was hard to buy that after he rapes her and takes on her best friend as a permanent in-house mistress. The only other complaint I have is that the duchesses affair with her childhood lover isn't given much screentime. I just couldn't see the chemistry and he looked like a dollar store Rami Malek.",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2012,plan99,3," The book is much better.
","Having read the book that this film is based upon my expectations were high although I thought that the short running time could not possibly do justice to the 450 pages of the book, and I was not wrong. It barely skimmed the massive detail contained in the book and was a big let down for me. It was beautifully made with seemingly no expense spared on costumes or locations but to give one example no mention was made of the huge gambling debts run up by the Duchess, which was of course a major problem for her. The author of the book must have been severely disappointed as after seeing this poor film few would want to read her excellent book assuming it to be as bad as the film.",/review/rw2560509/?ref_=tt_urv
