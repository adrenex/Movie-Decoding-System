17 January 2023,haa4,7," That's Amore?
",Another solid entry in the 2nd Wedding Veil trilogy. This time we revisit Emma and Paolo who now live in Chicago. I'm not sure what the passage of time has been since The Wedding Veil Unveiled but it's at least 2 years given that Avery's son is now standing in his crib. So Paolo is just now opening his high end lace shop. Is that even a thing?,/review/rw8836176/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,Arthur-76302,10," Autumn Reeser Led Hit
","Enjoyed the whole cast of likable characters led by the accomplished and talented Autumn Reeser who is a pro in her profession. Her range of expressing emotions is astonishing and only seems to grow in each of her roles. The location on Victoria Island, BC is perfect and the cinematography clear, rich, and crisp. This is truly a delightful buddy film where three true friends stick together and move the narrative of the Wedding Veil series. Autumn Reeser and her co-star Paolo Bernadini definitely have chemistry and bring out the modern-day issues of a two-career couple. This time the relationship is a really long-distance romance: Chicago and Italy. Hallmark has grown into producing mature stories and has an excellent repertoire of actors and talent to bring intelligent films to their audiences. Bravo.",/review/rw8836176/?ref_=tt_urv

","Perhaps it is because I'm worn out from the common Christmas movie plots, but I enjoyed this movie. And it wasn't quite the usual non Christmas plot even though it is predictable and has a very low level of tension. Emma's trials are not that different than anyone who has a demanding boss. There is a small twist at the end and I did wonder if that was the case before it got there.",/review/rw8836176/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,hallmarkmov,9," Hated the emma's boss so much!!
","I love this movie series and seeing where everyone's life is now especially Emma. All of them had such happy endings from the first trip loft and it's nice to see how they get through the challenges of going from single independent women to now being married and being pulled by their career driven nature. Having said that I HATE the academic chair! She was sooo awful! And I hate that Emma was laughing when it's revealed she was purposefully making her life hell. Emma is now unemployed and wasted years and years of her life! She could have had kids a while ago, and might have even ended her marriage because of the lies and constant emotional abuse from this person. I've had deans and managers like this who constantly put me down, bring up my clothing, the way I present myself, their personal dislikes that are not university driven, and the whole ""I'm doing this for your own good"" gaslighting approach. It made me furious that it ended on a light hearted note and that walking away was the only option. I am glad she moved to Italy and started a family and has a life she deserves but I also wished her career would somehow be brought up. Like she became dean at the Italian university or something. Her friends are amazing and I loved how they showed up every time she needed them without needing to say so. They supported her like real friends should and I really liked the part where they ask what's keeping you in Chicago? No family- no friends- a dead end job is not enough. The dean did her zero favours and she should not be thankful for her. I like that the message at the end was they were finally taking control of their lives and not letting others dictate it. Can't wait to watch the next one!",/review/rw8836176/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is ""episode 5"" of a loosely related series of RomComs united not by a thread but by an Italian wedding veil.",/review/rw8836176/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,gbolinsky,10," Exceptional Characters
","I love this series. The stories are realistic, and the three lead characters just happen to be three of my favorites, from all your films. Just wanted to give kudos for adding the ""Lily"" character. Great choice in
the character and the actor. Kacey Rohl fits right in. It would be wonderful if she appears in the next chapter. If not, I believe that if she is available, she would should be considered for future stand alone films, as well. I realize she was playing a role, but she is delightful to watch. Also, the idea of putting these three women together in a series of films was brilliant. Thank you.",/review/rw8836176/?ref_=tt_urv

",The next installment of the Wedding Veil was wonderfully done. It ended making me feel happy. Some people have been disgusted with the writing concerning Emma.,/review/rw8836176/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,jiaidc,6," Woman submits
","This movie was written to have so many specific explanations, but it in the end she yields her ambitions to the those of her husband. She abandons her city and her country to save her marriage and yield to the wishes of her husband.",/review/rw8836176/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,cberry610,5," Autumn Reeser and Paolo Bernardini deserve better
",Both of the leads are capable of so much more than this script offers them. That's the biggest takeaway of this movie.,/review/rw8836176/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,flynn-34801,1," Worst of the Series
","Unfortunately, I have to agree with the other review thus far posted. I will not go into the sordid details that make this by far and away the most lame installment of this series, but suffice it to say that Emma's husband comes off as a wolf in sheep's clothing, and Emma is reduced to being yet another educated and talented woman with a dream of her own who gives everything up for her man. I mean, come on now, here we have a tenured university professor who loves teaching but is by the end of this travesty reduced to producing videos for free. All so that her husband, who by all accounts has lied about everything he agreed to do for her when they were in Italy, can return home permanently at the first sign of family problems. This disgusting reprobate even had the nerve to suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, announce that he was homesick for his family, having to be reminded by his wife that SHE was now his family. (BTW: He was going to leave a brand-new, multi-million dollar store in the hands of a novice?) It is shocking that both Lacey Chabert and Autumn Reeser, who executive produced this disaster, would allow a woman to be diminished so thoroughly. This is their idea of a marriage of equals?",/review/rw8836176/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,cgvsluis,8," The wedding veil returns and this romantic is thrilled to get back to the Di Stefano's!
","This was a wonderful new entry in the Wedding Veil series. In this, the fifth movie, we revisit Autumn Reeser's character Emma and her Italian husband Paolo. They are living in Chicago and Paolo is about to have the opening night of his family's business in America. The veil and the christening gown are on display for opening night when Autumn and her assistant/TA Lily show up. Lily inadvertently touches the veil, while trying to avoid it, at the same time as Paolo's cousin Matteo. Emma is struggling with her five year plan, her annoying boss...and then Paolo's father is hospitalized in Italy. Paolo ends up in Italy while Emma stays in Chicago, this puts a strain on their marriage as Emma never wanted to have a long distance relationship.",/review/rw8836176/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,sallylit,10," My Favorite Couple in The Wedding Veil Series!
","Emma and Paolo are my favorite couple from the The Wedding Veil series. I LOVED their first movie when they met and married, and I LOVED this sequel to their story. Their on-screen chemistry is amazing making their love story so engaging to watch. I loved Paolo's commitment to his family and the family business and how the couple dealt with their career issues. I would love to see their storyline continue in future movies!",/review/rw8836176/?ref_=tt_urv
