10 August 2020,ztigr,6," Not a 1 star, but not a 10 either
","This series was a weird mish mash of 21st century culture clashing with 1930's reality. Alternative lifestyles, racism, politics, corruption, religious zealots, chauvanism, and uncertain economics all interwoven into a crime of the century murder trial. It all ends up sort of like Chinatown, with Perry Mason instead of the PI Jake utterly confused by what has just transpired. And that was my real question, is why Perry Mason. Why take something that most are familiar with and turn it upside down? There comes a point where your just using the name Perry Mason, and not much else. Its like taking Superman, taking away all his super powers, his cape, and making him a cop on the beat, but still calling him Superman. It doesn't make much sense. So its watchable at a time when a lot isn't and that's why it gets 6 stars. If you want Perry Mason, better invest in some old VHS or DVD's",/review/rw5854295/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've never left a review on here, but I feel I have to with all the backlash I'm reading. No, he's not an attorney, but I feel he will evolve into that throughout further seasons with Della by his side. I love the gritty, dark vibes in the show and think it's an excellent noir with great acting and writing all around, especially considering HBO's less than stellar track record with shows lately. I hope more people enjoy it too and it buds into an excellent multi-season series.",/review/rw5854295/?ref_=tt_urv

27 July 2020,geoffkabat,9," Puzzled
","I'm completely puzzled by the reviews of this series. I love good noir. The series, in my view, is the best contemporary noir since LA Confidential. The cinematography is beautiful, the plot doesn't insult me, and you actually have to listen to the dialogue to follow the plot. The characters don't look like something out of Entertainment Tonight, and the meter, cadence, and thstructure are right on time. If you like noir, and you're not texting, posting on Twitter or Instagram while you watch, you won't find anything better.",/review/rw5854295/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2020,jeffpsy,5," Perry Mason, PI? Sacrilege
","The question I have is, why would HBO take an iconic character like Perry Mason, and turn him into a two-bit private investigator? I get that this is supposed to be a prequel to the Perry Mason we all know. However, Perry Mason was a dignified defense attorney and Paul Drake was his trusted PI. Why portray Mason now as a weasel who makes a living taking pics through people's bedroom windows? This is a strange corruption of the Perry Mason franchise, and not terribly interesting to boot.",/review/rw5854295/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2020,BoomerFan,8," This isn't Raymond Burr's Perry Mason - and That's Okay
","This is a completely different story, in a different time and place than the 1950s TV series. It's darker, messier, less predictable. That's not a bad thing. Maybe this is a Perry Mason origin story that will eventually lead to the polished courtroom wizard we all know and love; maybe it won't. I don't really care. It's a ride worth taking no matter what. It feels like Chinatown; it's got some things in common with Showtime's Penny Dreadful: City of Angels. The acting and production values are first-rate. Like many series first episodes, it takes time to set up characters and situations - the pace should pick up. I'm intrigued enough to see where it goes from here.",/review/rw5854295/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2020,eskelslay,9," Noir that we need.
","I can't believe the hate I'm reading. I heard of Perry Mason from my parents. Its an origin story and it won't always match up with the original and THATS OK. The cinematography is great, the writing is top notch, the story is awesome. This is the Noir that we need. If you want a good show to distract you from the current world, watch this show.",/review/rw5854295/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2020,shakspryn,1," Roll your own, producers
","The first Perry Mason mystery novel was published in1933. Perry was a tough and resourceful attorney. He also had tremendous integrity. He was never, ever, a down and outer. He was a hero, in the same way that Sherlock Holmes was a hero. He was not an anti-hero.
The producers should have just made up their own character names. There is no reason to use the names of Perry Mason and his associates. Many younger viewers have likely never read a Perry Mason book. This gives them a false and wrong idea of the character. This is like taking a Silver Ghost Rolls Royce and chopping it up into a hot rod with flames painted on the sides. Bad idea. Really, really bad.",/review/rw5854295/?ref_=tt_urv

22 June 2020,claudiaraesherman,5," What Were They Thinking
","Very disappointed. Instead of an intelligent lawyer for Perry Mason (which I thought maybe John Lithgow might be him) they made Perry Mason this slovenly investigator, basically a low-life. HBO had an opportunity to follow the original story of Perry, but threw it in the trash. Shame on them.",/review/rw5854295/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2020,kckidjoseph-1,1," In Search of Perry Mason
","Full disclosure: I'm a retired television critic, and a Baby Boomer. I grew up when the popular 1957-66 CBS TV ""Perry Mason"" series had its original run, but scrupulously avoided the show because I regarded it as starchy, predictable -- and boring. Mason won his case every time (except, I think, once, which caused a minor sensation trumpeted in TV Guide). But years later, as a critic, I had a chance to profile Barbara Hale, who played Mason's loyal secretary Della Street on that series, and she described a lot of behind-the-scenes pranks perpetrated by star Raymond Burr. It occurred to me, why couldn't they have brought some of that playfulness to what we saw on the screen, Bret Maverick or Jim Rockford as Mason, a man who was a crack attorney but had fun with it? It would have stood the genre on its head, much as ""Maverick"" had done to the staid Western back in the day of the old formulaic Warner Bros. oaters. So it was with great expectation that I tuned in to this HBO miniseries iteration of ""Perry Mason,"" hoping against hope (this is 2020, after all) that, yes, they get that, this should be fun! Well, it isn't. It's very bad. And what makes the whole thing so exasperating is that it could and should have been terrific. It's a lush, expensive production. And it has Matthew Rhys, a very fine actor, as Mason, and is directed by the talented Tim Van Patten, whose resume includes the likes of ""The Sopranos"" and ""Game of Thrones,"" among other things. First, some background. The story is set in 1931 Los Angeles. That's good. You get Hollywood during its Golden Age, the upcoming Olympics, the Great Depression, the period between world wars. All sorts of things could happen. Well, it turns out Mason in this go-round isn't a lawyer, but a private investigator. (An aside. The creator of Perry Mason, Erle Stanley Gardner, was a lawyer who loved the law and its finer points. He hated the versions of Perry Mason in the old movies, and on radio, because he felt they strayed too much. He only agreed to do the 1950s and '60s series because the producer had a background in law and promised that it would meet his demands. As mentioned, I found the series boring, but many people loved it.) Back to this ""Perry Mason."" In this story, Mason is now a private investigator -- yes, not a lawyer -- and not an especially good one. He's a loser. A World War I vet veering toward alcoholism separated from his estranged wife and son. Running around in the obligatory fedora (which looks like it came right off a costume shelf -- ""Yeah, take that one, it's brown and matches the jacket""), he continues to put himself in jeopardy and get the crap beat out of him. I confess. I'm no fan of violence, but it would be nice either to have him not do that, or hit back. So there's that. In the story, P.I. Mason is assigned by his friend and mentor, at the behest of a mogul, to the case of a baby boy who is kidnapped and has his eyes stitched open before his death under shady circumstances. If that sounds gross, yes it is. And that's another problem I have with this production. Whenever there's a chance to be gross, it is. In spades. Mason has a stain on his tie, so he goes to the morgue and gets one he likes from a dead guy. And of course there are the obligatory scenes urinating and having all sorts of sex. But the big enchilada is when Mason tries to blackmail Hollywood executives by photographing one or two of its big stars having in flagrante delicto -- yup, you guessed it, in a really gross way. (If your thing is seeing a full frontal of a 400 pound guy running down the street naked, this is the film for you.) Mason follows up by doing some really stupid things when surrounded by some guys right out of Dick Tracy. Who would do that? Well, an actor told to do it in the script. Speaking of the script, it is incredibly hackneyed, and one has the sense that the actors feel hemmed in, and thus have become caricatures. It's corny and off-putting. The cinematography, alas, is so dark it would put the legendary Gordon ""Prince of Darkness"" Willis to shame. With Willis, whose work included the likes of ""The Godfather,"" the darkness was a metaphor, its shadows and nuances used brilliantly. Here, you'll find the darkness causing confusion because you can't tell one character from another. Not good. You'll also find yourself confronted by what Alfred Hitchcock called ""refrigerator moments,"" moments when you stand around in the kitchen after watching the film realizing it's full of holes. Also not good. I'm really saddened because this production could have been so good. Maybe you like all the negatives I've listed here, maybe that's what you like. We reside in the apogee of grossness, after all, when too much is never enough. But for me, even during a time when we're in stay-at-home mode looking for some interesting and entertaining ways to pass the time, this is a real waste of that time.",/review/rw5854295/?ref_=tt_urv

22 June 2020,KathleenK22,9," Only one episode so far yet the verdict is in?
","Why are people criticising this because it is not what they want to see, a stereotypical Perry Mason. How dare there be any poetic licence or creativity or change. All we have seen so far is a depressed man who has been through a war, lost his family and down on his luck. Will the real Perry Mason please stand up? I have yet to decide. The first episode is merely the backdrop and the curtain will rise soon. By the end of the episode we see a shadow of the man he will become. The puzzle is displayed and he emerges with a plan and a direction. Give the show a chance for goodness sake. I will revisit this down the track after watching the series. Many questions to be answered and the start is promising. Acting is what you would expect from this guy having watched every episode of The Americans. I am looking forward and not judging this early so I shall return later.
Later....Only a few episodes left and we now see the real Perry Mason emerging, well worth the wait and the build up!",/review/rw5854295/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2020,birger-18,8," Perry Mason origin story
","So far I like this series. It is different from the original series, but that's okay with me. If there is a Season 2, etc., I think the show will evolve Perry Mason's career into the type of attorney people remember from the original series. John Lithgow's character is a defense attorney and described as his mentor.",/review/rw5854295/?ref_=tt_urv

","I had rated this 9/10 after the first 2 episodes but it went downhill from there. It got too slow, not in a good sense but in a way that they filled up the time with some unnecessary scenes. E06 did kept me watching until the last episodes which was half cooked at best. Some unanswered scenes too like what happened to baby's body? and who is the new child? and like how mason got his lawyer licence? and why his investigator leaves him for his rival's side? why the church lady runs away after seeing the baby on the road?",/review/rw5854295/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2020,nancyldraper,8," Release all expectations
","If you are hoping this series will be like Raymond Burr's 1957 PERRY MASON, then release that expectation. This is an HBO production, so you can expect nudity, crude language, politically corrected characters and violence. What you will also find is some very talented actors giving convincing performances. Matthew Rhys portrays an evolving character, slowly breaking free from PTSD. I cringed when I heard that Tatiana Maslany's character was going to be an Aimee Semple McPherson copy, but I have to give credit to Tatiana, she didn't settle for disparaging stereotype but, unsurprisingly, gave a nuanced performance of a young woman caught in extraordinary circumstances. BRAVO. In essence this first season is an origin story for the character of PERRY MASON. It begins in one place and ends with Perry Mason, lawyer. I enjoyed it and will look forward to the second season. I give it an 8 (great) out of 10. {Crime Drama}",/review/rw5854295/?ref_=tt_urv

","...and I'm not disappointed. I'm all for providing an old story an origin, and this production gives you just that and does it very well. And, boy, is it gritty, dusty, smoky, and boozy. It is not for the weak-stomached. Keep in mind that this is an old story being told in today's voice. The Perry Mason of the 60's is an interpretation of his character for television audience of that decade, produced for family network TV, while the HBO version is for an audience that expects what HBO is capable of delivering.
