31 July 2017,arungeorge13,5," Performances: Great, Story: Okay, Climax: WTF? [+46%]
","While the title and synopsis suggest a survival drama, this movie in fact gives you very little detail on the actual measures taken to 'survive' in a situation of prolonged power outage. Two sisters, Nell and Eva, are left orphaned after their dad succumbs to the injuries he received from a chainsaw accident, leaving them helpless at their house with no electricity.",/review/rw4040067/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2019,Henry-klein,4," A good movie ruined by a horrible ending
","If you are a fan of the apocalyptic survival genre you will enjoy the movie until the last 5 minutes. The ending is poorly conceived, totally unrealistic and flat out stupid.",/review/rw4040067/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2016,claudio_carvalho,3," Boring, Senseless and Stupid
","In an isolated house in the woods, a widower (Callum Keith Rennie) lives with his daughters Nellie ""Nell"" (Ellen Page) and Eva (Evan Rachel Wood). When there is a power outage in the area, they have problems to get fuel and supplies in the nearby town. Soon there is a general power outage and the family stays isolated without means of transportation. Out of the blue, the man has an accident with a chainsaw and dies. Now the two girls have to learn how to survive in the wilderness.",/review/rw4040067/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2016,gulag,6," They would die fairly soon in the real world.
","Without getting into all of the other hot topics that this film engenders, as an Alaskan I can say that from a purely survival aspect they wouldn't make it a winter. And in fact if this was supposed to be anywhere in Canada where was winter? It always seemed green. There are few berries in winter. Unless they lived in a fairly substantial house they would freeze to death. And there is very little food apart from hunting in the winter. And they certainly did not learn enough to survive simply from books. They would run out of ammo soon. They showed no skill at creating tools or salvaging them. And certainly none at basic house repair. In fact I would say they were just about the unhandiest women I've seen in the woods. Essentially this was just an emotionally acted fantasy without much basis in the real world. Kind of a shame. I had hoped for more.",/review/rw4040067/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2018,anthony-burton4,5," Probably the most forced plot ever!

31 July 2016,MdlndeHond,3," In a post apocalyptic scenario your biggest concern is.....Mold
","If Teen Vogue made a remake of Temps Du Loup, this is what it would look like. It's not bad but for an connaisseur of dystopian & post apocalyptic fiction I tell you this will not be a classic. For a film about two sisters, one Lycra clad and fashionable, the other boyish living in a glass house in a forest in the midst of a disaster of world wide proportions the film is lacking the sense of emergency and impending doom you would expect in this scenario. When disaster hits one has major issues to solve (like bickering about music, ballet audits and mold) before even finding out what kind of disaster has occurred. After fighting off intruders, living on rations for months you know what will finally drive you out? Mold!",/review/rw4040067/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2018,attennessee,3," not guided by good sense. lazy and offends anyone with a brain.
",Let's just say there was a lot of license and a lot of liberties taken to make this story last as long as it did and the viewer is asked to blindly accept a lot of things that just don't make sense or add up (and i'm not even a survivalist! lol).,/review/rw4040067/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2019,creetar,5," Eva, Eva, Eva, Eva!
","80% of the plot is Eva! Eva! Eva? Eva?? I don't even remember the name of the other girl, cause she is always calling her sister for at least 50% of the movie. Logic is nowhere to be found. If you have nothing else to watch, go for Fox News or the last YouTube Top #5 instead.",/review/rw4040067/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2020,mochteam,1," Boring and Unbelievable
",Both of these spoiled brats would have been raped and sold off for food and water after the first week of the power outage. This movie is beyond unbelievable but it tries to be this heart felt potentially realistic story about two girls surviving against all odds. One likes to dance and is too old for whatever competition she was trying to do (I'm guessing X-Factor). The other one I guess is supposed to be 17 or 18? but she acts like she's a 30yo playing as a 17yo maybe that's because she is. There's not much else to say about this movie. Two spoiled chicks and their exotic house in the woods try to tough it out and bad things happen to them.,/review/rw4040067/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2017,drossvirex-89438,1," How to not survive when the power goes out.
","At first I thought it was going to be little interesting to see how they all survive, but as the movie goes on you find out the characters are the kind that would not survive any kind of apocalypse in the long term. If that's the point of this movie, then they nailed it. The movie might seem like it has a good ending, but in reality they wouldn't last a week with an infant without a decent shelter.

9 June 2017,gogeccc,5," WTF, where their brains at? :D
","Seriously, in the ending I was like WTF, DUDE!? After delivering the baby, walking to the house in the rain, she decides to burn it down? I thought she was displaying a case of postpartum psychosis and wondering what is her sister gonna do about that... And what does she do? She agrees that the best option, with her sister's baby just having been born, is to burn the house and go live inside a tree bark while it's raining and doesn't look like it's gonna stop? WTF!?",/review/rw4040067/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2019,csab-39797,4," We're almost out of toothpaste! Oh my!
","I had hoped this movie was going to show survival skills but it showed 2 girls who seem more concerned about dancing and running out of toothpaste. I don't know why the title is Into the Forest when the only time they venture into the forest is at the end to go live in a tree stump when they should have in reality stayed in their house since it was pouring and the sister just gave birth. Especially since the northwest would be freezing!
Besides the stupidity their are numerous plot holes.. a boyfriend who trekked out to their house from the town,in the rain, which took him 8 days on a bike and admits to little survival skills. He goes there to see if his gf wants to WALK to Boston where he HEARD they have power!??? REALLY??? Common sense would tell you that IF there were power on the east coast wouldn't they send help to the west coast? And how did he hear this when not even transmitters are working? Oh and he determined it's an 8 month walk.. with 1 gun and a group of 12 lol uhhh good luck with that!!
The one sister is studying to be a doctor yet her father dies in 5 min after slicing his leg w a chainsaw.. they barely try to help him, like maybe tighten the turnicate!? Then there are wild boars ,yet they never decide to kill any wild animals to eat until the one sister becomes pregnant from a rape. Instead they eat what looks like dog food.
And don't get me started on the constant complaining about wanted to use the last bit of gas in the generator to practice for a dance competition! Seriously!
I felt like whoever wrote the script should have done some survival research or just burned the script instead of the House.
I only gave it 4 stars for the scenery which is pretty.. I guess! Lol",/review/rw4040067/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2016,Red_Identity,," Expected more
","I feel like the premise for this called for a truly visionary, unique tale. It was definitely compelling and mostly well-done, although its effect mostly comes from its acting. The screenplay needed some more work to more readily establish its main goals. Evan Rachel Wood and Ellen Page are strong in their roles and do more work to fill in the gaps in their characters' writing and development. The music is sometimes a little over-the-top, and the film tries too hard to move you at certain times (and instead of being effective comes across kind of awkwardly). Still, this is a mostly entertaining, mostly well told, even if it could have been truly great, film.",/review/rw4040067/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2018,Aaron1375,3," Another vague apocalypse is upon us!
","What is with all these supposedly apocalyptic movies where they do not attempt to explain what is going on? We get one here that features a blackout that makes things really quite inconvenient...I thought something would be revealed at the end, something that may have been creepy due to the font they used for the title of this one, but no, another movie where nothing was revealed and there is seemingly no point to the film other than teaching us that if you have no power, your house collapses fairly quickly.",/review/rw4040067/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2016,drenstere,4," Good cast, bad writing
","(I intentionally tried my best to avoid spoilers, but please let me know if I didn't) I would have lost a bet if someone told me Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood were in a flick that sucked, but here you go. Good performances for both, some great emotion, but the whole of the writing suffers from plausibility problems, almost like a freshman film student didn't have a mentor review her work before final submission. It affects really basic things that are glaring. Set aside the narrative on the human condition, etc. for a moment. That can be massaged by the writer to match her message as she sees fit (some of the messages are not all that great, but I'm a guy), but what is obviously lacking in the story is the amount of technical consult work that must be done to ensure any viewer that has a slight idea of how things work doesn't turn away from the film before the conclusion. Perhaps I'm not part of the target audience? Unclear. Is it ready for the 2am slot of the lifetime network? Sure, why not? Every other medium will probably leave the viewer wondering if this same story could have been told with a lot more attention to detail. I mostly can't stand remakes, but I would welcome another crack at this.",/review/rw4040067/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2016,Seth_Rogue_One,7," Good drama with solid performances

27 April 2020,a_chinn,7," End of the world film is ordinary and scary as it likely really would be.
","This realistic end-of-the-world story unfolds as it likely really would. Ellen Page and Evan Rachel Wood play sisters living with their widowed father in the forest when an unexplained power outage occurs that leads to a breakdown in civil order. There are rumors as to what happened or how widespread it is, but it's never fully explained and that is not the focus of the film. The story instead focuses on Page and Woods' characters and how they face the many challenges of living in this new world, which includes grocery store clerks now carrying shotguns, rationing gasoline, and an increasing wariness of people who used to be friends and neighbors (or even relatives). I don't want to spoil any plot points, but what unfolds is what would likely really happen. You'd have to contend with a world without lights, internet, or music. You'd no longer know what's happening outside your village. You'd have to get used to the idea that the world is forever changed and is not going back to how things were before. In many ways, this film felt like the 1983 film ""The Testament,"" which depicted a typical family after a nuclear warhead fell on the United States. Completely unsensational but the ordinariness of the characters and situations make the film far more identifiable of an experience when compared to ""Mad Max"" or ""A Boy and His Dog,"" and consequently more impactful. However, on the downside, the ordinariness of the film also leads to some slow pacing and not always compelling of situations. Still, within the context of this film, it does work and is what makes this end-of-the-world story unique and all the more engaging. FUN FACT! The pig butchering scene was real. Ellen Page learned the process specifically to include in this film.",/review/rw4040067/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2016,imdb-4074,1," Absurd and totally pointless
","Utter waste of time - this movie is one ridiculous scene after another, with pointless decisions which make no difference to the lives of the characters apart from make their situation worse, to the point that they start in a house and end up living in a tree stump. Never seen such an awful movie.",/review/rw4040067/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2016,ChetXBuck,," Interesting Concept, Terrible Execution. Someone lost their way.
","We wanted to like this film. But we could not. It failed us. The premise is interesting and the acting starts off pretty solid and believable. The characters talk and act in ways that you can believe at the outset and you are drawn in by the mysterious direction of the plot. Then, something happens and the characters just keep plugging away as if nothing is wrong. There are so many outrageous inconsistencies and plot holes that you can't keep up. Without giving away the plot, I will just say that they go from one extreme to the other and the characters do not react as any person ever would. The story continues with more absurdity and tragedy. The characters continue to do mindless and illogical things. At this point, we lose interest in the story and follow along with half interest just to see where it ends. It can be said that there is some very good acting in this film. But the writing and direction drag this into two big thumbs down. Bizarre does not mean good. Sorry.",/review/rw4040067/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2018,areatw,2," One of the dumbest survival films I've ever seen
","I've seen my fair share of dumb apocalypse scenario films, ranging from the far-fetched to the completely implausible, but 'Into the Forest' takes the biscuit. This film is just ludicrous, dreadfully written and featuring characters without a brain cell between them. Anybody with an ounce of common sense would never do what the characters in this film do to survive, in fact they would often do the complete opposite.",/review/rw4040067/?ref_=tt_urv
