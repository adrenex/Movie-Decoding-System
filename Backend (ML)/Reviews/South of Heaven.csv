","Granted, I haven't seen the original trilogy in some time, but as of right now this is the best of ALL Star Wars movies for me.",/review/rw8557769/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2017,Tweekums,10," An impressively dark 'Star Wars' story
",Everybody who is a fan of 'Star Wars' will know that the rebels had acquired the plans to the Empire's new weapon; the Death StarÂ… this film tells the story of just how they acquired those plans and at what cost.,/review/rw8557769/?ref_=tt_urv

28 February 2019,isaiahjjohnson,9," Best modern star wars
","This felt like an original trilogy movie. The characters are amazing, action is beautiful, and story is solid.",/review/rw8557769/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2022,Drawmort,8," An example for future Star Wars movies
","Rogue One feels like a serious and grounded movie, with a plot that weighs a ton, that feels important on every scale from the very beginning and as the movie progresses it shows that it's on another level, much higher.",/review/rw8557769/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2019,MOVIE-REVIEW-POOPSHOOTs,10," This IS Star Wars. At its best.
","What has made Star Wars into the internationally recognized genre that it is today? Two things in particular - original material and a touch of humor/wit. Rogue One is a plethora of both. In addition, even in an area where previous Star Wars may have lacked (perhaps even overlooked, understandably), the acting is superb, top of the line. Forest Whitaker may be the most recognizable name in the entire cast, and he kills it every moment as his brilliant, rebellious character, Saw Gerrera. But he is merely the tip of the iceberg in what becomes an epic, near-perfectly written plot that connects episodes III and IV. It is haunting, it is funny, devastating, cheesy, and it is wonderful. It IS Star Wars.",/review/rw8557769/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2019,switchboard85,8," The Best Of The Disney-Era Star Wars Films
","Without exaggeration, this is easily the best offering in the franchise since 'Return of the Jedi'. Yes, it is a spin-off of a simple set-up line from the original film, but it manages to really craft it's own story around the demands of where the plot has to go by the end. While it's definitely not a character driven movie, I was surprised with the amount of time given to our key protagonists and the effort to at least make them intriguing.",/review/rw8557769/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,jace_the_film_guy,9," Diamond in the Rough
","Rogue One is a surprise diamond in the rough. Though the film lacks the flair (minimal lightsabers) and wit (barely any humor) of other Star Wars films, it fits the narrative being told. The cinematography is Rogue One is crisp and the dialogue is generally pretty good. The tone is serious and the characters fully embrace the severity of the situation. There are duller moments, particularly in the first two acts, but the story comes full circle in the end.",/review/rw8557769/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2019,ingra88,10," Far superior to JJ & Johnson's work.
","This movie brings back why we all loved Star Wars in the first place. For those who remember watching the original in the cinema long, long ago in a cinema far away....it's brings a tear to the eyes, how they recapture the classic imagination that JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson could not.
Thank you Garth Edwards, you have given back the fun where others have failed.
Johnson's 'Last Jedi' was just awfully bad.",/review/rw8557769/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2019,oriente385,10," So thankful for this film :) 10/10
","This week I've decided to make a Star Wars' week. I watched all 8 episodes and the last two (7 and 8) left me feeling betrayed and utterly disappointed. Luckily, I still had to see this one and Han Solo film (I really don't know If I want to risk and watch the latter). Rogue One fits perfectly in the Star Wars saga, it has the feeling of grandeur, seriousness. Yes, there are some jokes but they don't make this film a farce like it happened to the 8th instalment. The main hero is a woman but she isn't annoying and she isn't a super human. Nobody is a super human, there is no place for magic and the laws of physics and the force aren't violated, as neither is viewers intelligence. The plot is simple but it delivers. The characters from older films are treated with respect. I give this film 10 stars because it is truly a Star Wars film. I was sitting on the edge of the seat and couldn't look away from the screen during the fighting scenes, they were so intense and spectacular . Thank you.",/review/rw8557769/?ref_=tt_urv

2 August 2017,TheLittleSongbird,8," A rebellion well worth saving
","Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'. Personally actually loved 'The Force Awakens', despite the vitriolic hate it's got.",/review/rw8557769/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2019,dcesar13,9," Back to the roots
",Rogue One is the movie we didn't asked for - but what we got was beyond any expectation. Excellent pacing of the movie. As the movie progresses it gets better and better. Culminates in one of the best finales seen in any of the Star Wars movies.,/review/rw8557769/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2019,ghanima_atrieadies,10," Perfect
",The people who did this need to do the other ones. They aren't very good but this was perfect. They took a known outcome and told us the story of what happened. I have no complaints about this movie. Highly recommend it.,/review/rw8557769/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2016,azanti0029,10," Gareth Edwards has done it - The prequel story that Star Wars deserved.

7 January 2017,zardoz-13,10," The Best ""Star Wars"" Saga Since ""The Empire Strikes Back!""
","Nothing worthwhile comes without sacrifice, and the superlative science fiction saga ""Rogue One, A Star Wars Story"" exemplifies this notion. Basically, ""Godzilla"" director Gareth Edwards, ""Golden Compass"" scenarist Chris Weitz, and ""Bourne"" trilogy scribe Tony Gilroy have eliminated all those buffoonish, kid-friendly aliens primarily Jar-Jar Binks and given adults a chance to experience an unusually Spartan ""Star Wars"" saga. No, the PG-13 rated ""Rogue One"" is neither ""Saving Private Ryan"" nor ""Hacksaw Ridge,"" but the straightforward action will give you a reason to shed a tear since a palatable sense of doom looms over this skullduggery. Everything I've read about this entry in the ""Star Wars"" universe emphasizes the word 'stand-alone' so you won't be seeing the gifted cast, featuring Felicity Jones, Forest Whitaker, Donnie Yen, Ben Mendelsohn, and Diego Luna, reprising their roles unless Disney conjures up prequels. Of course, this doesn't apply to Darth Vader who behaves like the ruthless ruffian that he has always been. Mind you, in some respects, ""Rogue One"" may seem hopelessly predictable for some aficionados. If you've seen George Lucas' ""Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope,"" then you know that the Death Star didn't survive that adventurous classic. ""Rogue One"" qualifies as a prequel. Chronologically, this outing takes place between ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" (2005) and ""Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope."" Although we know the Death Star is ill-fated, what we didn't know the identity of the individual who sowed the seeds for its destruction. Some of the finest moments in ""Rogue One"" occur when the Grand Moff Tarkin appears. This is the infamous character that the late British actor Peter Cushing of ""Frankenstein"" fame portrayed with such ascetic villainy. Cushing's estate approved the physical recreation of the late actor's personage, and actor Guy Henry's impersonation is flawless. Quibbles aside, if Peter Cushing could see what they've accomplished, he'd be impressed. Similarly, what Edwards and his scenarists have achieved with Disney's audacious attempt to expand the ""Star Wars"" time-line is sensational. Indeed, the House of Mouse has succeeded where few film studios have ever gone with a legitimate spin-off from a multi-million-dollar franchise.",/review/rw8557769/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2019,ma-cortes,7," Emotion , thrills , noisy action , super-spectacle and impressive aerial combat effects

In a short time period right before the events of A New Hope , we find ourselves in the middle of a galactic war between the Rebel Alliance and the Empire .The synopsis of this film starts in the entire opening crawl with the traditional text from Star wars (1977) : A long time ago in a Galaxy far , far away .
