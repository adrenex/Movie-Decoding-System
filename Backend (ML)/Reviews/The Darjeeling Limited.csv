11 August 2021,Supermanfan-13,8," Still a pretty fun show!
","Leverage: Redemption is the reboot of Leverage and has the entire original cast back with the exception of Timothy Hutton (because of his legal problems), they replaced him with Noah Wyle who steps in and does a fantastic job. This is just a flat out fun show to watch if you can just turn your brain off because some of it is ridiculous but in a good way. If you're a fan of the original Leverage then this show is absolutely for you!",/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2021,Nightmarelogic,9," As good as the original
",Not sure if the bad reviews are from people who actually even watched the original because they seem to complain about the content and how silly it is. The show was ALWAYS silly. That was part of the fun. The other group are the people who complain about the lack of Nate Ford and hate the new characters. The reasons Timothy Hutton left the show are the reasons he left the show and he more then likely isn't coming back even though they have been settled. The show gave Nate Ford a happy ending and it works for the show and bringing him back will cast a needless darkness on a light hearted show. And yes the show bends toward a certain direction that won't appeal to everyone. The crew are not going to take the side of a rich businessman trying to force his employees off the picket line. They just aren't. If that is who you root for then this isn't the show for you. But it is a fun light hearted heist show that doesn't take itself too seriously and is fun to watch.,/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,8," Glad It's Back!
","Leverage: Redemption is the reboot of Leverage and has the entire original cast back with the exception of Timothy Hutton (because of his legal problems), they replaced him with Noah Wyle who steps in and does a fantastic job. All the heists are exactly as the original but the characters have all since grew and evolved since we last saw them. This is just a flat out fun show to watch if you can just turn your brain off because some of it is ridiculous but in a good way. As long as you don't think too deeply about what you're watching then I promise you'll have a good time watching it. If you're a fan of the original Leverage then this show is absolutely for you.",/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2021,ogarcia-24929,8," Welcome Back
","Good to have these guys back in my life, lol. Loving it already. Noah Wyle is a nice touch. I miss Timothy Hutton, but Noah and the rest of the cast have good chemistry. Lets hope for a Season 2.",/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2021,stueysmom,10," The Robin Hoodlums are back!!!!!
","This was everything I hoped for and more. The original characters kept their appeal and stayed true to their roots, and the new additions are wonderful. Same great writing, directing, and acting. All the ""jobs"" were fantastic with Parker's love of vents, the costumes, and Eliot's fight scenes. I do miss Nate but Noah Wylie's character is so much fun and he never ever tries to replace Nate. I'm so glad the wait is finally over but it was definitely worth it. Thank you Dean Devlin for giving us back our hitter, hacker, grifter, and thief!!!!!",/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2021,letiamj-95088,8," The first two episodes have stayed true to the original series
",I watched the first two episodes Thursday and they reminded me of the original series. I did not miss Nate at all.,/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2022,shapet99,9," This is a gift for those who loved the first (and similar shows)
","Here's the bottom line: if you loved the first show, you'll love this one. If you love this type of show, the kind of light action/lightly procedural show that used to be syndicated and then later flourished on basic cable (TBS and TNT, most of all) like V. I. P, Psych, The Librarians, Monk, Relic Hunter, etc. You'll love this one. It's so beautifully and firmly in that lane. It knows who it is , what it is, and what it's trying to do. If you want edgier fare: bad language, sex, hardcore violence, and gritty realism, you won't find any of it here. If shows like this have to choose between depressing realism and an unrealistic happy ending, they'll always choose the feel good ending and that's absolutely okay.",/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2021,joyfulresearch,10," Happy they revived this show!
",Fun Fun Fun! Good story with lots of humor. We need more Robin Hood stories with happy endings! Love the cast of characters and how they interact with each other. Thank you for bringing this back in such a great way. It is as good if not better than the original.,/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,paulcarr1302,7," Not as good as the original but still fun
","I loved the original show. I'm going to call this a spinoff as opposed to reboot though. Excluding Timothy Hutton (for a legal issue that was later dismissed) was a little hard to take. His omission is glaring, especially with Noah Wylie as his ""replacement"". I never bought Harry's reasoning for him to become part of the team while Nate and his experiences made it easy to see why he was doing it. While not the same character type at all, it's just not fitting.",/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2022,marxspawn,8," Let's Go Steal A Television Show...
","I am so glad they brought this show back. There just doesn't seem to be much television like this on anymore, shows that are just a joy to watch. I enjoyed watching older shows like Monk, Psych, and Leverage and still watch them today, but now we have Leverage Redemption.",/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,moviegeek_ny,7," Nostalgic reboot-sequel that loses steam a little
","I was ecstatic to see Leverage return and loved the first couple of episodes because they had the old-school feel of the earlier seasons, but after a few episodes the reboot started to feel a little tired and repetitive. I have to say, Aldis Hodge's absence makes itself known very acutely - you really realize how important his presence was for the team dynamic that made up the magic of the earlier seasons. Still definitely worth watching though!",/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2021,d-robold,10," It works
","We really are enjoying Leverage: Redemption. The cast is excellent. The stories and characters are just like the originals. So entertaining. So well written. One of the smartest points is that Nate is neither forgotten nor eclipsed by the addition of Noah Wyle as Harry Wilson. He has his own distinct character. The show is a pleasure to watch. As we do the original, we will watch the episodes over and over. Hoping for many more seasons.",/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2022,slshusker,9," This is such a smart and enjoyable franchise.
",The casting of personalities that have meshed well for seasons makes Leverage a smiley watch.,/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2021,sagon-77202,10," About Time
",About time they bring old shows back that were canceled for no reason and so far this is even funnier than the old series 10 years.,/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2021,wwiiboomer,10," Enjoying every moment--Thank you...!
","I'm so glad this is finally here for all to enjoy! Dean Devlin, is undeniably a man of great talents! A true visionary! Also, Chris Downey & John Rogers, initial writers of its predecessor, Leverage--back together again for more fun & dazzlement that will entertain & have us wanting for more...",/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2021,laurennesbitt-43975,10," So glad they're back!
",I've just started but I love that they are staying true to the original show! The characters and actors have grown but they still have their same amazing chemistry. So excited!,/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2022,edmondsonalicia,10," Great but miss Timothy Hutton
",Love the new reboot and absolutely love Noah Wyle. That being said it is in desperate need of Timothy Hutton. It's good but still missing something. Timothy has been cleared of all charges and should have never been let go just because someone claimed he did something 30 years ago. Dean Delvin needs to bite the bullet apologize to Timothy and bring him back(but also keep Harry). There has never been anything said about how Nate died. There are still ways to bring him back(in tv no one stays dead). Damien Moreau is still in jail. He could have made a hit on Sophie and Nate had to disappear to save her. Sterling could have helped fake his death. And now must come back to save Sophie cause Moreau is coming after the rest of the team now. Make things right between Timothy Hutton and make this reboot 20x better.,/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2021,zombiemockingbird,6," I Want to like it...
","I'm torn. It just isn't the original, and that makes me sad. No one can replace Timothy Hutton, but I like Noah Wylie as an addition to the team; I just wish Timothy was still part of it too. I still love Beth Riesgraf, Gina Bellman, Christian Kane and Aldis Hodge and although they seem a little older they're still the team I love; and the first two episodes were pretty true to the original. The third episode however, without Aldis Hodge, was missing an integral part of what makes the show work. So far, I'm just not feeling Aleyse Shannon as the new team member. She's too scattered and all over the place and she doesn't really seem to fit in; maybe she's just too young. I'll keep watching, and I hope they continue it , and maybe it will get smoother as time goes on. I may have to go back and re-watch some of the originals to make me feel better.",/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2021,arc-67711,9," Yay... The team is back together..
",4 episodes in and I'm really not missing Nate. The rest of the team is as fresh as ever. Delightful entertainment and interesting cons. The new blood is entertaining as well...,/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2021,mkcwrg,9," They just had to comeback
",If you watched all original show from the beginning and now the new ones I think it's one of the best shows on tv . In today's world there are scammers everywhere so we need alittle LEVERAGE to fight back . Please keep this show going .,/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2021,meganallison-91528,10," Love Love Love
","The best thing about Leverage Redemption, in my opinion, is that it has the same feel as the original. It feels warm and bright and that is a hard feeling to capture. I love the way that the new characters mesh with the old ones, it feels like they have been here the whole time. One thing that I really enjoy seeing is how much Parker has grown, all through the first show she was maturing and growing and it's awesome to see what has happened with her. I am interested in seeing how she and Sophie work together with the new dynamic of Parker being used to being in a leadership position, which she previously wasn't in. Seeing how they all mentor Breanna is also really cool and I think it is shown in an honest way. In real mentorships, both parties learn from each other and that's what we are seeing here. I truly hope that we will get more episodes, storylines, and jokes, haha (maybe a bit more Hardison as well)!!",/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv

25 April 2022,Morticia89,10," Change is Good, and it works!
","I was curious of how the change without Tim Hutton would work. Although I miss his character, Noah Wyle has stepped into the empty place with a zeal all his own. Love seeing old familiar faces from TOS back, and the one-liners and Easter eggs are perfection. I am SO happy to see this series back and now renewed for a second season! Thank you Dean Devlin and the fabulous cast!!",/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2022,rickwilley,10," I'm so glad the gang is back!!
","My wife and 2 daughters watched this show every week for it's much too short of a run on the network (CBS) I think? When my wife and I saw that they had gathered the band together and they painted in Noah W, perfectly and I thought he did a much better job than T. Hutton with the whole vibe. I'm so glad that Paramount is going to give it another chance! This is a 7-9 year show easy!",/review/rw7240899/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2021,irinarobacki,10," Missed them so much!
