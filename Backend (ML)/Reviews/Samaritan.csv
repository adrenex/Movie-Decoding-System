21 July 2009,blanche-2,8," Wonderful new series on Lifetime
","""Drop Dead Diva"" is a new series on Lifetime. The pilot is very enjoyable, mainly because of the star, Brooke Elliot, who is fabulous. She plays a brilliant, highly successful attorney, Jayne, who pays no attention to her appearance - she's on the heavy side, and her hair is long with no style. One night, she stays late at the office, and a man, angry with one of the partners, comes in with a gun. She is killed. At the same moment of her death, a shallow, pencil thin, blonde beauty named Deb is driving to an audition to be a prize demonstrator on The Price is Right and crashes while putting on lipstick. Upset that she's dead, once in heaven, she hits a ""return"" button when the check-in person isn't looking. She ends up with Jayne's body, Jayne's brains, and her own memory.",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2009,audrulyte,7," Excellent and really enjoyable
","I simply love this new TV show and wish it would last for more than just a season or two like some other great shows I loved and that were off. Anyway, let's talk about Drop Dead Diva. Actually, my first reaction to the show, or frankly to the TITLE of the show, was kind of ""What a nonsense they're putting on"". Hello!? I could not have been wrong more here. Not a nonsense. Quite on the contrary. One can not only get a nice law story per episode, but also gets a share of really great performance here as well as really lovable characters. I loved and love a lot of TV shows (most of them already ended), but since my late teens I for the first time am really thrilled with the main character of the TV show, as well as I can well put myself in almost every position she's in (except, huh, for having your soul trapped in a wrong body). It's like in many TV shows and movies we only get these 'super white big smile nice body' actors and actresses which all look great and at the same time almost the same and just as unreal as Santa to any grown-up, but this time we are getting this new character which is awesome, beautiful, and at the same time just like me, you or someone next to you. And I really love that. Long live the show as there is one fan for you here already",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2009,MattDevivre,7," DDD has its charm !
","Even though I'm not among the typical target group of this show I like ""Drop Dead Diva"" season one. From my perspective this show did a lot right, starting with a more than just likable, talented cast and nicely written often touching stories.",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2019,ModGoviya,10," Who saw the REAL Deb; Grayson or the Heavenly Records?
","I absolutely loved this show for all the reasons others who have given high ratings did. That being said, I do have one confusion.",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2009,ZoZo13,7," Brooke Elliott is a Delight!
","I rarely watch Lifetime because their programs, in my opinion, always seem like the same, lame, made-for-women schmaltz. But I have to state that ""Drop Dead Diva"" was so very good! We've seen many movies with this plot: two people die at the same time but one person's soul enters the other's body and has to live that life. Brooke Elliott is delightful as the plump woman who winds up with a thin, empty-headed, self-absorbed woman's soul. I love the way she discovers her new self after a tragic accident and is quite convincing. Elliott is so cute as she enters this new world as a thin soul in a plump body. Her laugh is contagious. Her pain is convincing when in a moment of clarity she finds out how other people suffer. The producers of this show so far have not made it too preachy (don't judge people by their appearance), or too lightweight (they don't spend too much time on the thin woman's life). If this program continues to focus on ""Jane"" in the here and now without lots of flashbacks on the other woman...they have a hit on their hands. I love the thin friend too. She's adjusted and accepted her friend in a new form.",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2020,saundrakuhl,6," This Was An Excellent Show Up To Season 5, Episode 3-5ish
","I have seen this show, now for a second time and seriously, the last 1.5 season and episodes are a far, far stretch of reality. No one that I know would graciously grant my best friend the sperm of my ex-fianc√©, the acceptance of their sexual relationship and their upcoming nuptials. All of this on top of the death and return of Graysons character as a inmate on death row. I don't know if they lost writers, focus or became bored with the official direction of the show, but they lost all of their sparkle with the dream, singing and special guests that I thoroughly enjoyed, including the late Joan Rivers. Don't watch the last season as I have made the mistake of doing so which has now left a bad taste in my mouth!!",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2014,margil-1,4," The End a Disappointment
","They took a good show and murdered it. I was particularly disappointed that Jane did not do the singing in the last show!!!!! The story line became so stupid it was beyond fantasy. It should have ended with the wedding and if they wanted it to end with the babies, how about showing some newborns and the cast gathered around the mom. If that put too much focus on Stacy, then have Jane hold one kid and say the things they said going into her house. They could talk about their own kids while holding the new baby. I was all a big mes. At least they found someone for Kim at the end. I kept thinking of the show when it started. It was really good. I enjoyed the singing when Jane would sing like a regular person not in a dream. Why did they stop her from singing? The first three seasons were the best.",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2009,flowerwings,7," Really great!
","I caught the pilot of this show today without very high expectations, but it was actually really great and really amusing, with a fun soundtrack and interesting setting. Brooke Elliott is great as Deb in Jayne's body, the switch she portrayed between the characters was subtle but apparent, and she is very likable. The supporting cast are also all very strong. The writers do well in drawing the audience in, I already care about these characters after one 40 minute episode. Having told myself I am going to watch much less TV, and dropping about 50% of the shows I used to watch regularly, the fact that I plan to continue watching Drop Dead Diva shows how entertaining the pilot was. I'm looking forward to seeing more of what this show has to offer, and I hope it continues to deliver and develop into a great series.",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2009,Golden_Lily,10," Brooke Elliott, the new ""It"" Girl
","Like Tom Hanks, Brooke Elliott has ""that certain something"", that very few actors have. It has to do with Likability. She exudes a very pleasant charm. She makes it easy to believe that a sweet, model-aspiring airhead has inhabited a high power attorney and has access to her rapid-firing brain cells. I like it that the Jane Bingum character has a golden moral compass and yet is playful like a Sex in the City girl. Kudos to the creator and writers for creating a character that is like a real person. The Jane Bingum character reveals great sensitivity and vulnerability along with areas of great strength and fortitude. This is no ""one note"" character like the many that usually populate series TV shows. Drop Dead Diva is both high drama and wry comedy by virtue of its excellent writers. But, where would this show be without Brooke Elliott? It will be interesting to see what she does next. I predict a smart producer or director will cast her in a movie on the big screen very soon.",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2011,breezymoon1,10," Deep, engaging and fun!
","Between the excellent cast that seems to mesh so well together, the clever, poignant and fast-paced fun scripts, and constantly interesting subject matter, this show is ready to become Classic TV.",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2013,dandan-dandan,5," Used to be good, then turn into day time crap
","They need to bring back Jay Parker, hands down, and cut the ""original Jane"" character, and stop making Stacey make so insanely stupid decisions and being extremely dramatic, like suddenly going on needlessly urgent search for sperm donors to have a baby, sacrificing her relationship with Jane just to briefly hook up with Owen, then for no reason at all making a big deal and breaking up with Owen. It makes me sick to my stomach. Owen's character used to be so in love with Jane, for him to suddenly pick up Stacey and act all natural make it seem unbelievable and audience lose respect of him. You can tell the actor playing Owen (a very good actor) even has a hard time trying to make it seem justifiable! Any self-respecting actor will feel the writing is crap. What a waste of a good cast! If they are doing a sixth season and want to retain followers and attract new viewers, they NEED to do the following: 1) Their most urgent need right now is to bring Parker back and keep Kim around! These two are immensely appealing and drawing actors and characters. They bring depth and charisma to the show. 2) Secondly, make Stacey herself not a crazy friend betraying, sperm-crazy, lunatic mom! 3) last but not least, bring Jane and Grayson together already. It's painful and annoying to watch another episode where the show tries desperately to drag on the suspicion with irrational plots of surprises coming up last minute or interruptions during their confessions. It's not interesting anymore nor suspense. Just plain disturbance and people are losing interest fast. They need to move the show onto new grounds and stop spoiling a fresh idea by lazily adopting old tricks to fool the audience. These writers and producers need to get real and make a honest living, or most viewers will not return. If they follow these suggestions, I think they will find the show more successful. If they don't heed advice from the very people the show's trying to draw, they aren't very smart.",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2009,BeanMak-1,9," charming acting, interesting characters
","What a FUN show. The plot is familiar but well worked. Brooke Elliot is delightful to watch! She captures the flirty sorority girl trapped in a plus sized body with panache. The rest of the cast is delivers interesting performances and I really want to get to know them all. It will be interesting to watch the development of her guardian angel as he figures out life on earth. The court cases are interesting to observer. I usually avoid Lifetime and its sentimental disease of the week programming, but I am seeking this show out. I hope that they will be able to sustain their great start. I am not sure if it is being picked for more episodes, but I hope this show has a long run!",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2011,SteffieB,8," Not your average TV show
","OK, you KNOW if Margaret Cho is involved, there will be some decent writing. As much as I like the show, Cho's is my favorite character. She fires up any scene she's in. Wait, no Fred is my favorite character. And Grayson. And Jane! Everybody's interesting, seriously, and the acting is really right on. The premise is Freaky Friday meets LA Law, but add in a guardian angel, smart chicks, models, and fresh story lines.. and hey, you've got my attention. Drop Dead Diva is unpredictable, but with the likable hooks surrounding romance, achieving partner, and beauty. You can stream it on Netflix, which is slightly addictive. So beware.",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2015,SnoopyStyle,6," nice group of characters
","Deb is a shallow model with lawyer boyfriend Grayson Kent (Jackson Hurst). On the way to a Price is Right audition, she gets killed in a car accident. She goes to be judged by angel Fred (Ben Feldman). Fred is surprised that she has done no good deeds or bad deeds. She is so shallow that she has made no impact. Even more shocking, she pushes the return button. Her soul returns to earth into Jane Bingum (Brooke Elliott) who was shoot in her office. Jane was a workaholic disheveled lawyer. Now Deb has to live in chubby Jane's body with Jane's knowledge and Deb's memories. Fred is sent to earth to watch over Deb/Jane. She tells Deb's best friend Stacy Barrett (April Bowlby). Teri Lee (Margaret Cho) is Jane's assistant. Kim Kaswell (Kate Levering) is Jane's competitive coworker and Jay Parker (Josh Stamberg) is the boss. In the third season, Deb/Jane falls for lawyer Owen French (Lex Medlin). In addition to dealing with the new body, Deb/Jane is soon joined by Grayson at the law firm.",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2022,denis888,10," Very Clever TV Show
","Very smart and highly entertaining courtroom drama / comedy / fiction with a stellar cast and pretty amusing plot twists. Do not search for tiny mistakes in legal procedures depiction - the show is not a teaching documentary for future lawyers, after all. Clever fun and a very good pace make it very captivating. Brooke Elliott is a huge winner, with her impeccable performance and sheer brilliance in showing inner struggles and courtroom routine. To describe the rest of the cat would take the rest of the day, so just wrap up saying - highly recommended!",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2018,BCMovieFan,9," Fun creative show with several twists

19 October 2009,muchcashflow,9," I like this show and think most people will enjoy it
","I love this show! My sister is the one who turned me onto this. She was visiting and while I worked she spent a lot of time watching TV and movies. Anyway one day she kept bugging me to watch this show she DVR'd. It sounded idiotic to me, but I gave in. And I was hooked. I always set my DVR to record it now.",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2014,Shopaholic35,8," Emotionally deep but still quirky, fun and endearing.
",Drop Dead Diva is truly a very entertaining show. It's kinda campy yet emotionally deep. All the characters are fun but a little kooky and completely endearing. It's what draws you into the show and keeps you hooked. Thankfully the show continued on for a few more seasons so it didn't end on a cliffhanger. I just don't think I would have been able to cope.,/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2016,svekwasek,5," Decent show
","This show is alright. It's often funny and heartwarming, and the legal stories are usually pretty interesting too. I utterly loved the characters of Stacey and Fred, in particular. For the first 2-3 seasons, I was pretty hooked on this show.",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2011,jmullen-4,8," Enjoyable new series
","A light-weight comedy, and quite enjoyable if somewhat formulaic. Have I seen this somewhere before? Apart from the main stars, the additional characters add some depth to the series. And it is nice to see the unexpected guest star (ref Liza Minnelli). Why the 'dumb blondes'? Why should it be expected that blondes would be dumb. I'm not! The story revolves around a model who died and came back to life in another body - a lawyer no less, and the cases she becomes involved in.",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv

29 June 2018,linapopova,9," A Drop dead review
","Can i say that i absolutely love this show. If you guys are ever tired of watching heavy shows with zombies, vampires,stalkers and everything, this show is for you. This is a show that in one sitting you will watch it. It is a really loveable, comfy, hilarious show, i honestly don't have the words to describe how good and amusing it is. This show follows the life of a model named Deb who gets into a car crash and suddenly she wakes up into an another body, in details in a body of an overweight, very intelligent lawyer who basically changes everything about how Deb sees. I like Deb, but i love her so much more in Jane's body, there is something so loveable, comfy in Jane that we just can't help and love her more and as well as her crazy assistant Teri. The characters are awesome, everyone unique in their own way, the cast is spot on, the plot, world building, i loved it, that is all i've got to say. Oooh and i also think that Jane dresses better than any model out there, there are many top fashion advices in this show also which it makes better than watching some serious fashion show, just saying. I definitely recommend this to everyone, give it a try guys, i promise it is not some dumb show that will disappoint you, it is really great and with some really talented actors.",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv

22 December 2019,tect-03564,9," My second time watching this one
","I just loved this series. The main actress did an excellent job in her role. Heck, all of them did. The only thing I didn't like too much were Jane's dreams with that singer Paula, those kinda bothered me. But aside from those parts, everyone did an excellent job. I love series with happy endings, and all the characters got their happy ending, not as expected, but it worked out great.",/review/rw5342402/?ref_=tt_urv
