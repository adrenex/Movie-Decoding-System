18 October 2016,gogoschka-1,9," Ambitious, complex sci-fi/mystery thriller; offers great world-building and perfectly paced storytelling
","Wow: This was by far the biggest surprise for me in 2016. And apparently, I was somewhat late to the party, as the show already began to air in 2015. I'm an avid sci-fi fan, but I hadn't heard or read anything about 'The Expanse', and yet it's one of the most ambitious sci-fi (or generally high profile/concept TV) shows I've come across in recent years.

30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Great Sci-fi Series!
",The Expanse is a sci-fi series that takes place hundreds of years in the future where humanity has colonized the solar system and where Mars has become an independent military power. Tensions between Earth and Mars have put them at the brink of war. It follows a space ship and it's crew as the race through the solar system exposing one of the greatest conspiracy theories in human history. I never watched this show while it was on cable but finally started watching it once Amazon Prime Video picked it up. I just heard so many great things about it and how it was one the best sci-fi shows ever created. I'm glad I finally gave in and watched it because I couldn't agree more...this is one of the better sci-fi shows I've ever seen! I'm so glad Amazon picked it up and continued the show. It got even better at Amazon because they gave them a bigger budget. It just finished the last season and ended on a great note. People are talking about a follow up movie so maybe there's still more to come. We can only hope!,/review/rw8613370/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2017,mhorg2018,9," Best thing on SyFy since Battlestar Galactica
","Damn. If the Syfy (I hate that abbreviation) Channel would show more stuff like this and less from The Asylum, I'd watch it more. This is simply great SF. The physics of space travel are as realistic as can be. The characters, from Miller the beat up Belter Cop, to Amos the Earther, to Holden the righteous captain by default and the places, Ceres, Tycho, Earth and Mars are all well defined and believable. The sfx is brilliant and the ship designs look like they've evolved from what we use today. The situations, different governments vying for power, resources and land, are all excellently done. A really great adaptation of a really great book series. This should be watched by anyone who even claims to be a sf fan.",/review/rw8613370/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2020,Supermanfan-13,9," One of the better sci-fi shows I've seen in a while!
","It's hard to even describe how good of a show The Expanse is, especially if you're a sci-fi fan. All you have to do is read through the reviews to see how loved this series is. I don't know anyone who's seen it who doesn't like it. It has an 8.6 rating for a reason. It's so good that I definitely plan on watching it a second time through in the near future. The series just ended after season 6 and even though it had a conclusion to the story and didn't end on some cliffhanger, it still is open ended enough to have another season or movie on the future. If you haven't seen this incredible series yet then do yourself a favor and go watch it immediately. I'm warning you now though to give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge it as fast as you can.",/review/rw8613370/?ref_=tt_urv

24 July 2019,XweAponX,10," Can't believe this was Syfy Channel
","And, in true Syfy form, of course they cancelled the series right in the middle of an important season apparently - If I understand the trivia section correctly. Thankfully Amazon took over and did a fourth season, maybe they will do more- that would be great.",/review/rw8613370/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2022,ssvfolder-1,8," Smart and captivating
","Why do a good sci-fi shows usually run for a very long time? Probably because it's mostly made by the fans and for the fans. Without too much interruptions from the execs who think they know better. It's well known what happened to the once largest sci-fi franchise, Star Wars, when the big corporation got a hold oof it. Glad it's not that common occurence as this niche is largely in the hands who know what the fans like.",/review/rw8613370/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2021,RussHog,9," Love this show - sorry I took so long to find!
",I am about halfway through season 2 and I'm so glad that I have so much more of this show to watch. The first season started a little slow but it was always interesting and this second season is on fire. It's very suspenseful and well acted and the universe is very believable. It's not really a great acting ensemble but there are some good performances all throughout. The plot is kind of confusing but it's not so confusing you cannot enjoy the show or get too lost. This is much better than most other shows on TV.,/review/rw8613370/?ref_=tt_urv

1 March 2020,abisio,10," Perhaps the best series I see in my life
","The first two seasons of THE EXPANSE had very interesting and deep conflicts; incredibly absorbing characters. Pace and tension was so perfect is unbelievable the writers were able to keep 26 chapters without slowing down. Even the productions values were very high. Third season starting some slowdown particularly in the last few episodes but nothing too bad. Season 4 however is perhaps the slower and dissociated one. Some political and crime stories matter very little compared with the Rocinante and their crew adventures; but still after chapter 4 things become more interesting and tense.
The Expanse has been able to get interesting secondary characters integrated into the main action. Sadly some emotive moments are not necessary but I assume is to make characters more human.",/review/rw8613370/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,Reviewer746,9," Wait... where's the rest?

15 December 2019,Kajohns49,9," Season 4
","When I heard that SyFy was cancelling the series after 3 seasons I was very surprised. Since the beginning this show has had an excellent story, interesting world building, a great cast and good production values. I thought it was one of the better series on TV, not just science fiction but including all genres.
I was gratified to find out that Amazon picked this up and was eagerly awaiting its release. Well, I just finished season 4 and am pleased to announce that the high quality series has returned! My only regret is that for some reason I thought this season was 13 episodes instead of 10 and I wasn't willing for this to be over. I have never read the book(s?) this is based on so that has nothing to do with my review. I will only say that to anyone discovering this series for the first time I envy you! When I saw S4 E10 I got a little sad that it was over.
Season 5 looks like it will be fantastic as well!",/review/rw8613370/?ref_=tt_urv

20 September 2022,pudjo-dewo,8," Just starting season 4, so far so good?
","Season 1, kinda boring, but understandable, due to the spread of human race in the solar system, they have to stitch the store first
Season 2, starting to understand the big story
Season 3, very exciting, at awe with the storyline
Season 4, this ""land grab"" conflict between humans doesn't make sense, I mean thanks to the ring gate they had just discovered are 1300+ new solar system, that means at least there are 4000+ new planets waiting to be discovered. For human race with (I estimate) total population of under 70billion, That 4000+ new planets not enough?! Why the violent land grab?? Just doesn't make sense.. but with this protomolecules mystery still continuing, this series is still worth watching. I Hope quality of the storyline will pickup again.",/review/rw8613370/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2018,MiketheWhistle,10," Truly exceptional program - and I love Bobby the ""Martian Tank""
","I'm a big sci-fi fan and so my bar is fairly low, but this show raises the bar especially in seasons 2 and 3.There is action,great actor chemistry,great one-liners with unexpected actions,a good plot that doesn't seem like a repetitive drive,and relatable characters.
I also have to say that I love Bobby the ""Martian Tank"".She has great wit,is attractive,and absolutely does Marines proud having served as a corpsman with Marines myself.
Whether it gets renewed for a fourth season or not, time will tell, but I hope that SyFy keeps it going and with the characters and writers.

","When I watched the first episode of the 1st season of the series, I said, ""Finally, I'm watching realistic science fiction."" I watched the series until the final episode without missing a single episode. When the last episode was over, there was an emptiness inside me. Because I knew that a production of this quality would not come for a long time, a void arose inside me. I will really miss this serial.",/review/rw8613370/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Expanse is an ambitious Sci-fi series with many likable characters and amazing visuals. The Expanse has amazing world building which make the world richer and easier to get sucked into. The mystery elements and realistic Sci-fi aspects of the series make it all the more a gripping watch. Each season feels differently from one other while beginning and closing the main story. There's many shocking moments that propel the story forward. And the political aspects of the show might be its strongest trait. With complex plots that take time to unravel, The Expanse is a must watch Sci-fi series. Along with an awesome assembled group of characters, The Expanse is one not to be missed!!",/review/rw8613370/?ref_=tt_urv
