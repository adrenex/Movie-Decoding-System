","For me the backstory was even more interesting than the movie. In his younger days Thompson wrote the manuscript for ""Rum Diary"" but it had been left unfinished and unpublished. In more recent years Depp discovered it in Thompson's basement among other things and through a collaborative effort with others trimmed, polished and published the book. Now it is this movie, a very interesting one.",/review/rw2949344/?ref_=tt_urv

","I adored the novel, The Rum Diary and as an aid worker I related to many of the character's struggles. Although the film does stray quite a bit from the book itself, I think it's a perfect homage to Hunter S Thompson. The language still reeks of his Gonzo fury writing and manages to transport the audience into a drunken rant, as well as secretly educating them on the struggles of a free press. It had me laughing out loud on more than one occasion, as well as the packed out cinema that I viewed it with. ",/review/rw2949344/?ref_=tt_urv

He doesn't want to be a box office star. He wants to make movies that mean something to him and that is exactly what he did with The Rum Diary.,/review/rw2949344/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2019,classicsoncall,7," ""It seems to me there's a bad vibe developing.""
","An alcoholic with ethics - who would have thought? That would be Johnny Depp in his portrayal of journalist Kemp, landing a gig at the San Juan Star in Puerto Rico. He doesn't know it yet, but he's being recruited to write flattering stories for conniving developers who want to change the pristine landscape of an unnamed nearby island into a tourist trap with a magnificent hotel. Teaming with an equally sobriety-free photographer (Michael Rispoli), the pair form an unusual alliance with yet another outcast from society named Moburg. I don't think I've seen Giovanni Ribisi in a role I haven't liked, and he plays up the degenerate aspect of his character to the hilt. What it all leads to is a take down of Hal Sanderson's (Aaron Eckhart) latest scheme for scoring millions, while losing his fiancee Chenault (Amber Heard) to the often bewildered Kemp. I got a kick out of the scene with the hallucinatory eye drops, though I thought more could have been done with it. The island cock-fights looked real enough, but the FAQ page for the film here on IMDb explains how it was done to avoid the PETA folks' wrath. As for the sequin studded tortoise at Sanderson's - it could have been diamonds or zirconium, depending on how much rum you've consumed.",/review/rw2949344/?ref_=tt_urv

2 November 2011,jeremypb,," bad representation of an amazing book
","If you have had the pleasure of reading the great book from Hunter S. Thompson, ""The Rum Diary"" this film is not for you. And even if you did not read the book, this film lacks drama, cinematic style, character arcs, a hooking intro, and satisfying end. I am not sure if the writer/director Bruce Robinson spent the time to really READ the book. It's a DARK comedy, not a lighthearted love story. Hunter S. Thompson (played by Johnny Depp) was very depressed at the time, getting wasting, working minimal amounts, and having sex with any Puerto Rican girl that was interested. None of this was portrayed accurately in the film. ",/review/rw2949344/?ref_=tt_urv

29 February 2012,barron_oussoff,9," Very Underrated Movie.....Give it a Try !
","After all the bad reviews, I thought long and hard about watching this, but then respect for Bruce Robinson, and Johhny Depp took over, and I had to watch it. The movie turned out to be really great, the acting was very good, from everybody, the less colorful actor in this was probably Depp, but in relative terms of course, its just, he didn't bring anything new to the table, but all the other actors were a blast, Michael Rispoli was awesome, a great friend in the movie, just one of these roles that you watch it and want to go chill and drink few rums with him. Giovanni Ribisi is just great as a drunk journalist, lately, every role with him I saw, its just pure magic. His role is a bit controversial, or at least as Johhny said in one of his European interviews defending this film, few aspects of the film are not made for the American audience, I guess you have to watch the film and judge for yourself on this one. What else can I say, I was surprised, very underrated movie, don't go in expecting Withnail & I or Fear and Loathing because those movies are masterpieces in their own right, and its very hard to make something similar to them (especially Fear and Loathing) but this film definitely comes close in its atmosphere, pacing, and friendly feeling to Withnail & I, so don't go in expecting it to be Fear or Withnail, but keep in mind the charm is there. Give it a try and you will not regret it. ""_""",/review/rw2949344/?ref_=tt_urv

11 April 2012,bennicklin,9," The Rum Diary film review
","The Rum Diary is a drama conjoined with elements of playful humour, based on the self entitled novel by Hunter S. Thompson. The film boasts one of the most critically acclaimed actors Johnny Depp, who is joined by other noticeable stars such as Aaron Eckhart (The Dark Knight), Giovanni Ribisi (Gone In 60 Seconds) and upcoming beauty Amber Heard. Depp himself is familiar with Thompson when incorporating his novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas onto the big screen in 1998. With this in mind we were certain to expect elements of surrealism with maybe the odd drug usage now and then. The story is set in the 1950's and follows Depp through the character of Paul Kemp who moves to Puerto Rico as a journalist who is in search of work, a good story and possibly something more. With his new job comes new friendships, utter absurdity, vast amounts of alcohol all topped off with a blonde bombshell.",/review/rw2949344/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2011,cultfilmfan,," The Rum Diary
","I have been waiting for the film adaptation of The Rum Diary to be released for quite some time now. I am a big fan of writer Hunter S. Thompson and his books, articles and films made from his writings such as Terry Gilliam's 1998 masterpiece Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Over the past several years I kept hearing that different people were attached to do The Rum Diary movie, but people would back out and just when it seemed like the film was ready it would be delayed. Finally it has been released and I can easily say that the film exceeded way past my expectations of it. I own The Rum Diary, but it has been several years since I have read it and till I watched the film, I could not really remember all that much about it. Basically just minor details. This is not because it is necessarily a bad book, but when I read it, I think I found that I liked a lot of Hunter S. Thompson's other writings considerably better. Fortunately for me the film translates really well to the screen and has given me a whole new admiration for the book and the film has easily become one of my favourite films of this year. The story just briefly takes place in the 1960's where an American writer and journalist named Paul Kemp, goes to Puerto Rico and gets a job at a rundown and failing newspaper as a writer. There he befriends some of the others who work at the paper and gets involved with a shady character named Sanderson, and also falls for his girlfriend Chenault. Throughout the rest of the film there is a lot of humour, despair, eccentricities and a lot that I absolutely loved. When the film version of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas came out, it was really divided by critics. Some absolutely loved it and others hated it with a passion. I can safely say that if Fear was not your film, you may still like The Rum Diary. Fear was all about having a good time and partying and seeing all the freaky things that came out of it. The Rum Diary is a much more subdued and low key film in that regard. There is drinking and some partying, but not a lot and it is not the focus of the film. The focus and main message that The Rum Diary was trying to get across is the decline and failure of the American dream, politics, greed and human nature. It is told in somewhat a bitter way, but it is making a point here and is making it loud and clear just as revved up and ready to go as any of Hunter S. Thompson's writings. The thing is the characters in the film know of this decline and it comes to the point where they try and do something about it, but there is no values, ethics or things left to save. The film at times is a beautiful looking film and at other times very bleak, drab and ugly. I say this in a good way because it really strikes home the conditions the writers are talking about and further adds to the message it is trying to convey and also show the lifestyle of where they are living. The Rum Diary is not all hopelessness and despair either. There is a good amount of fun to be had here as well. Some of the supporting characters are so out there and wonderfully unique that they made me laugh out loud several times. I really enjoyed the chemistry and forbidden love of Paul Kemp's character and Chenault, and found it really added tension and other interesting elements to the film. That acting here by everyone is superb and there is not one weak performance in the bunch. The film has the look, feel and style of Thompson's gonzo style journalism and his blunt way of saying things. It strikes home a message that some may already get and others perhaps not. It is important, but remember that there is also a lot of fun to be had here as well. This film is destined to become a cult classic because unfortunately it is doing poorly at the theatres. If you are at all a fan of Thompson, cult films, or just anything different I highly recommend you give this film a try. One of the year's best.",/review/rw2949344/?ref_=tt_urv

22 February 2012,michaelRokeefe,7," For Johnny Depp fans.
","You have Johnny Depp in high quirkiness. A gorgeous woman in Amber Heard. A film devoted to the late journalist Hunter S. Thompson, who died in 2005. The story is set in the 1950s; Paul Kemp(Depp)is a New York journalist and yet successful novelist that is tired of the humdrum life he is living. Kemp decides to go to Puerto Rico, where he takes a job with a political, but unmotivated rag of a newspaper. The editor(Richard Jenkins), a booze-hound much like Kemp, assigns him the horoscope column and random tourist reports. Paul ends up rooming with an aging reporter, Sala(Michael Rispoli),who is definitely edging the end of his career. Paul sees both those that live in luxury and those that endure poverty and actually ends up making a business deal with a shifty businessman named Sanderson(Aaron Eckhart)and falls in love with his beautiful fiancé Chenault(Heard). It doesn't take long for the shaky business deal to spoil and the newspaper to hit the skids. Kemp leaves Puerto Rico a more experienced man. There is some awesome scenery, but a story line that won't appeal to all. Right before you start giving up on this movie...enters Miss Heard; a damn good reason to stick around. Also in the cast: Giovanni Ribisi, Julian Hollaway, Marshall Bell and Bill Smitrovich.",/review/rw2949344/?ref_=tt_urv
