22 November 2017,howard.schumann,8," Skewers the hypocrisy of the contemporary art museum world in Stockholm
","According to Swedish director Ruben Östlund (""Force Majeure""), society today has turned its back on the social contract, the obligation that people not only express their concerns for other's well-being but act upon them in concrete and meaningful ways. Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, Östlund's latest film, The Square, mercilessly skewers the moral hypocrisy of the contemporary art museum world in Stockholm, particularly taking aim at Christian (Claes Bang), the museum's chief curator whose pretensions are repeatedly called to task in creative and sometimes bizarre ways during the two hour and twenty minute film.

12 September 2018,myriamlenys,7," intriguing but distant
","To begin with the good : this is quite an interesting movie, which has intelligent things to say about life in our modern Western cities, with their ever more distant extremes of wealth and poverty. It also has interesting things to say about the various mishaps and misunderstandings which occur when an anemic and inbred elite of artists and patrons tries to tackle the big issues of our age. In the movie, as in real life, most of these attempts are so ill-judged, naive or patronising that they become part of the problem, not part of the solution. ",/review/rw4250359/?ref_=tt_urv

","I enjoy arthouse films, and I really enjoy films about art. But not when they yield whatever this ""movie"" was. This film was the guy-in-Starbucks-on-his-macbook-sipping-his-$8-latte-while-checking-his-iPhone X-posting-about-the-horrors-of-capitalism levels of pretentious.

22 November 2017,kyanberu,8," Satirizing the Cultural Elite
","Director Ruben Ostland has followed up his 2014 Golden Globe nominee Force Majeure with Cannes Palme d'Or winner The Square. The film is both a satire of the cultural elite of Stockholm and a sad commentary about the separation between individuals both within circles and between circles. The lead character, Christian (Claes Bang), is the curator of a museum of modern art that seeks to draw attention and donors through avant-garde exhibits and over-the-edge social media campaigns. The film follows Christian through a few weeks of his life when one of the hot new exhibits is ""The Square"", an actual square in the museum courtyard that is meant to be ""a sanctuary of trust and caring."" But rather than show trust and caring, the movie The Square raises a number of troubling questions: How thin is the veneer of civilization? Can political correctness substitute for empathy? Is art whatever a curator chooses to put in an art museum? And enveloping these questions is the separation of the circle of Stockholm's cultural elites from the City's homeless and immigrant population, as well as the separation of individuals within the City's cultural elite. One set piece in particular portrays the inability of the Stockholm's elite to communicate on a human level: It is Christian's meeting with Anne (Elisabeth Moss), a publicist, the day after a night of sex—and a bizarre argument over what to do with a used condom. In this scene Christian is totally unable to say the needed words about what had happened between them. (Anne, an American, comes across as much more able to relate to others than any of the Swedes in the movie.) Another memorable scene is the one in which a banquet for museum donors is interrupted when the performer (Terry Notary), playing an ape, goes out of control. The diners, who are initially frozen by their need for decorum, or perhaps by their need to display political correctness, ultimately go ape themselves. Perhaps not a total surprise since the same donor diners had earlier stampeded their way to a luncheon in a lighter scene. There are many sub-plots in the film—some satirizing interactions within Stockholm's upper class, others between classes— perhaps leaving some viewers displeased by the way the film jumps without warning from one set piece to another. Others may dislike long stretches of art-film inactivity in many of the episodes—something that explains why the movie lasts for 2 hours and 22 minutes. Nevertheless, The Square does capture the alienation of modern society, and does it with plenty of dark humor.",/review/rw4250359/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2018,seriouscritic-42569,7," Welcome to the Jungle
","A clever, and insightful, but somewhat meandering, social satire that, in hindsight, feels more like a series of vignettes loosely connected by the films protagonist, a well-known museum curator. The satirical sections that focus on the Modern Art world are dead on, although with, perhaps too much restraint. For the most part they are so understated you might find yourself wondering if the filmmakers were intentionally being satiric; except for, obviously, the film's high-point ""Welcome to the Jungle"" - both its most humorous and chilling sequence - which literally has a punchline at the end. It could easily be argued the film is worth watching for this section alone. Primarily concerned with how individuals interact with society and the world around them, scenes often play out with the camera focused on one character's reaction as opposed to the action, or conversation, occurring off-screen. This can be a disorienting choice, and, at times, confusing, yet undoubtedly all that is intentional. But be warned, the film will make no attempt to tie up all its lose ends: some characters just drop out of sight, storylines are left dangling and the movie just comes to a stop as opposed to having a real climax. You can be left feeling poked and prodded by the film for having watched it, as opposed to rewarded. But, hey, it's Art.",/review/rw4250359/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2018,deloudelouvain,4," Not that good, overrated movie
","The Square is just overrated on here, it doesn't deserve such a high rating compared to other also strange but good movies. The Square is a bit weird, and that's the focal point as I think they wanted to attract the audience's attention by being controversed and shoking, but in the end it's just all too long and not that interesting to watch. The acting was okay though, nothing bad about the cast, it's just the story that is not that interesting. For the humor part, which was not that present, I had a couple mild smiles but that was about it.",/review/rw4250359/?ref_=tt_urv

1 February 2018,Andres-Camara,3," We should ask ourselves if it presumes what it lacks
","The only thing I like about this movie is that it is a criticism of the absurdity that can sometimes result in many eyes, the art world. If the fact that someone says it, it means that something is already good. The problem is that it is the same thing that happens to the film, due to the fact that they do it, it does not have to be good and for my taste it is not.",/review/rw4250359/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2018,lee_eisenberg,5," stereotypically Scandinavian
","If you only see the poster of Ruben Östlund's Academy Award-nominated movie ""The Square"", you might think that it's an action flick. It's actually a drama calling into question the issue of what constitutes art, and also addresses ethical issues. The most recognizable cast member is Elisabeth Moss of ""The Handmaid's Tale"". However, it's one of the most stereotypically Scandinavian movies that I've ever seen: deliberately slow-moving. There are long spells where little happens. It's good in the sense of concentrating on the question of altruism and the protagonist's shortcomings, but it really tests your attention span. I only recommend it if you're into art-house movies.",/review/rw4250359/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2017,Blue-Grotto,10," Ingenious Exploration of the Breakdown of Trust in Society
","A wild man runs rampant through a crowd of elite dinner guests at their tables. According to instructions, those who do not look at or engage with the beast, will not be bothered in return. Yet this is only what they are led to believe, for the beast is about to violate their trust. The themes and story line of the Square expand on this theme. The film explores the breakdown of trust in society and the consequences of living in bubbles and attempting to insulate ourselves from harm.",/review/rw4250359/?ref_=tt_urv
