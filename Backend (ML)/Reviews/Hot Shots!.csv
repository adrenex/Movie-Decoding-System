10 January 2022,Gordon-11,," If you could go back time
","""Needle in a Timestack"" should be viewed as a drama set in a science fiction background. If you think it's a science fiction film, you'll be bored. If you view it as a drama, it would be interesting, because it's about all the could haves and should haves in life. It is about the regrets and sorrows of life, and what you would do to change it if you could go back time.",/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,ham-ma242,7," Something NEW
","A pretty authentic movie in which time travel is an every-day thing and anything can change if it's misused. Sure the movie is maybe too slow, but it's still pretty interesting. There is a character development and switching between alternative timelines (living through different outcomes), yet the main focus is on the drama and romance itself. It's not a 3~/10 movie, give it a shot. Clearly something different and refreshing than copy paste like most movies with same plot lines nowadays.",/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,LLgoatJ,5," Love story with a little sci-fi
",This tells the story of a couple who are very much in love but are split up permanently and forget each other in the present by an ex who goes back in time.,/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2022,janefgdoe,7," Very touching love story
",This movie is before all a love story. A touching one. One that you can relate probably after you pass some age.,/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2021,coreytegley,6," Good movie but wanted more
",Look story was good but it should of explained more about time travel and how they were able to do it. This movie is a LOVE STORY NOTHING ELSE so if you are looking for Sci fi or time travel it's not that. It's about love and how true love can outstand anything no matter what it is even time travel. Worth a watch.,/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2022,SnoopyStyle,6," intriguing idea but ends short
","Time travel is happening. The rich are doing it. Whenever a time shift happens, everybody scrambles to check for personal changes before they lose their memory of the previous time line. Nick Mikkelsen (Leslie Odom Jr.) and Janine (Cynthia Erivo) are happily married. He is worried that her first husband Tommy Hambleton (Orlando Bloom) is trying to use time travel to eliminate their relationship. That's exactly what happens and he finds that he's married to his long-time girlfriend Alex Leslie (Freida Pinto).",/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2022,kevin_robbins,6," This is a film with a lot of potential due to the great cast and premise but is executed poorly.
","Needle in a Timestack (2021) is a movie my wife and I recently watched on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a futuristic society where rich people can pay to go back in time and relive, see and experience other eras. Unfortunately sometimes they change the future, on purpose or by accident. Two men who used to be friends aren't so much any more after one of the friends marries the other's ex-wife. The rich friend is perceived to be trying to change the past to get his ex-wife back while the married friend is obsessed with the notion whether true or not which may be causing his marriage to fall apart.",/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2021,vlacarvalho,10," Love story poorly rated
","Normally I don't write reviews here in this space, but in the case of this movie, I had to come because it's very poorly rated. As of the date I write this, the grade is 3.8.",/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,KiddNicole52390,8," Give it a shot
","I'm guessing all the bad reviews are from people that just didn't understand the movie. It is tough to keep up with sometimes, as my gf and I had to talk about it with each other to make sure we were following.",/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2021,trealexander,8," Really Unique Time Travel Movie
","This movie was great. I enjoyed every minute. I cannot wrap my mind around the low ratings. Well I have my ideas as to why, but don't care to say..",/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,randyrobb-98180,7," Near Future Very Realistic
","The thing that impressed me the most is how realistic the future technology is. Very creepy in a Black Mirror way. It was a little slow, but NO WAY is it a 3.3 which is what the score is as I am writing this. I think that most people may see this as a love story, and this is how it seems at the beginning. But my interpretation of this movie is that technology is the antagonist here. No one can just live their life without someone interfering, and even though the message appears to be love will find a way in any circumstance, I see the real message is that technology that interferes by rewriting our past can cause a lot of pain and sorrow.",/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,quietneeded,10," Original.
",I was blown away with how good this movie was! Different from other movies that just copy another with different actors. Consistent from start to finish. I'm not a love story person. But this was great.,/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2021,Vectrexer,8," Excellent adaptation of the Silverberg original.
",Excellent adaptation of the Silverberg original. Be prepared to leave this movie in the same way Silverberg leave you as a reader for many of his stories. Which is to say the direction and production has done its job well.,/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2021,leroymccleary,7," A movie for Dreamers?
","I've never wrote a review on here but I was compelled to after watching this film 2am in the morning dealing with a little insomnia. I've read critic reviews which were all middle some (2.5 out of 5) etc. I'm leaning closer to a 3 out of 5. Without giving away to much spoiler information, I will say I enjoyed the film. The movie takes place in the near future where time travel exists but is expensive to purchase (think of The Arnold Schwarzenegger film Total Recall when he purchases a mini vacay to Mars"" In this movie if someone is using time travel it affects everyone around (it shows a physical glitch type somewhat storm approaching) it affects the closest to the person who used the time travel. A couple who are deeply in love start experiencing micro differences in their lives when ""someone "" is using time travel. The Male of the couple named Nick believes his ex-best friend Tommy is responsible. Nick ended up dating and later marrying Tommy's ex-wife and is sure Tommys (who's rich enough to time travel more frequently than your average person) is going back in time and corrupting Nicks present relationship with said Wife (her name's Janine) I won't spoil anymore to the story lol, but I'll say that things get sticky about a quarter through the movie. This film is about time travel, love, regret and relationships and the strength or weakness of such. Give it a look. I enjoyed it, and it kept me entertained mostly.",/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,ronan73,8," How has this only scored a 5 ?????
","I swear I dont know why ANYBODY has scored this below a 5. ( I do really)
Yet some streaming platform drivel with huge plot holes, awful acting, that looks like its filmed on a camcorder from the 90s can score 8!!...That Genuinely puzzles me.",/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,tellstar,4," Bloodless time travel romance
","As other reviewers have noted, this film is more about relationships than it is about time travel. With love as the central theme of the film, it's strangely and pervasively bloodless. We're instructed by music cues how we should feel about these characters, but they never generate their own spark. These people make a lot of money doing who-knows-what, with endless opportunities to spend disposable income. They live in spare, minimalist surroundings and speak entirely in clich√©. They care or don't care about each other on cue, to serve the narrative.",/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2022,TxMike,," A world where leisure time travel is just buying a ticket.
","My wife and I had difficulty with this movie. It is well made, it has excellent actors, but we found it hard to wrap our brains around the story. It is easy enough to understand but what are we to think of it?",/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2021,shopaholiq,9," Great movie, left me wanting more
","The movie is good and it stays very on topic, it's not a sci-fi movie and it never tries to be, it also doesn't brow beat us with the romance to over stress the point of this couple loves each other. It sets the premise and then goes about telling this particular experience of these people. The idea of this movie is very original in the time travel aspect, and while that in itself creates some plot holes and questions, the movie shies away from them and just pushes forward. When taking the movies as is at face value i can say I enjoyed it, so much that i wish i could know more and go deeper into the story, i want certain aspects explained and i wanted a more thorough resolution in the end. It is a little long but nonetheless interesting, if you're looking for the notebook kind of romance drama this isn't it, but if your looking for a high tech sci-fi movie about time travel, this isn't it either, those simply aren't the stories this movie is trying to tell. But it is a compelling story that could have been even better realized as a series. I say it's worth watching. I think many other reviews walked in with other expectations of what this was going to be and that's why some didn't care for it.",/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2022,dbuckshnis,7," Love story but not cohesive
","Great acting, mind-boggling plot line - but couldn't connect the dots as so many inconsistencies with the common theme of the sister and the birthday gift. Entertaining and thought provoking!",/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2022,info-90701,6," Good film, eventually, too slow of a start through cuz it missed plot point one!
","In standard film structure, plot point one drops at exactly 30 minutes into the film. There is a reason for that. People's expectations are now programmed to a certain timing in feature films. This one fell at 43 minutes, and it almost killed the entire film! Shame Ridley, as screenwriter first forgot that when directing this film, as he knows better. The timing, slowness and droning on music almost ruined a very decent film. In this age, when people only have an attention span of 3 minutes, that was a mistake.",/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2022,fmatt99,5," Trying to find a story in a haystack
","""What if...?"" Getting Orlando Bloom, Leslie Odom. And Cynthia Erivo to headline this sci-fi sleeper of a lovestory was quite a feat. Unfortunately that is where the wonder ends.",/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2022,jodyscott31,10," Touching and Unique
","Such a well written and acted movie! I love Love-Stories even if they are long-suffering and painful at times. This story was unique in its plot, even though time-traveling love-story movies have been made before. This is a must watch. It delved so deeply into love and all that it encompasses - passion, fear, longing, jealousy, confusion, loneliness, repair, and release. The acting really evoked all these roller coaster emotions so well...the cast is phenomenal (and beautiful). The journey this movie takes us on is truly breathtaking, inspirational, and beautiful. The music is also absolutely sublime! Gorgeous production!",/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2022,manleygurl,7," A sweet love story
",I like that's it's different. It's a bit slow but it has a great message. I live the all the main stars. I'm a big fan of all of them. Even more so now. It may be a little slow for some and there's not a lot of sex or violence - just a sweet love story. Ignore the low ratings.,/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2021,leonvand,9," Beautiful love-experience on different levels
","This movie is an exploration of feelings surrounding love. Loneliness, jealousy, missing, being together but not connected and not being together but very connected. These feelings go beyond reason, so trying to understand everything in the movie (although that's not an issue) pulls you of the core of this experience. It's a deep trip down love-lane that leaves its marks throughout your daily live.",/review/rw7509327/?ref_=tt_urv
