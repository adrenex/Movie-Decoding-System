","This has been an amazing season so far I really love how the writers dove dip into stuff that goes on in the black community; colorism, domestic violence, teen pregnancy, blm. It shows that this show isn't just about dancing and also about real world issues that have been going on.",/review/rw5906520/?ref_=tt_urv

9 August 2020,mscp-61051,9," More than about strippers
","When you hear the song in the intro and see the images of plight and poverty... You know this is more than about pole dancing. 4 episodes in, the layers are slowly unfolding about truths (spoken or not) in the black community. The club Pynk sits in the center of the town and is the catalyst for not only the non-gender conforming owner Uncle Clifford and all his girls Gidget, Mercedes, Mississippi and the new girl Autumn. There is dancing and when there is, these girls are amazing. But the show is not about the inside of the club. It is the broken lives of these people when they leave Pynk.",/review/rw5906520/?ref_=tt_urv

",Ive never been so invested in a tv series in my life. Pvalley sends you on a roller coaster of emotions and leaves you anxious to find out whats next. Each episode your sure to laugh cry or feel nervous .. We Definitely need a season 3. To see uncle clifford and lil murda's love blossom. Season left us wanting more!!,/review/rw5906520/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2022,francoischristana,10," Must watch very addicting!
","This show is so addicting, omg! If you don't live the entertainment lifestyle, you may not be aware of what goes on behind the scenes, but this show gives you the opportunity to do so. We are following hustlers in Chucalissa, Mississippi, as they travel the road to prosperity.",/review/rw5906520/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2020,girowaps,10," Awesome
",I love it! It's way more than meets the eye! It gives you a glimpse of life in the south and the adult entertainment world. Uncle Clifford and all the other characters are REAL! I hope it gets renewed for another season! It's giving me my Pose fix while it's on hiatus!,/review/rw5906520/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2020,coljam21,9," Why the low rating?
","This show is awesome! Uncle Clifford is my favorite character! This is not about glamorizing strippers, actually the opposite. The show is juicier than a georgia peach and will draw you in.
You got strippers and homosexuals and transvestites. What's not to love? Plus all that talent on the pole.",/review/rw5906520/?ref_=tt_urv

14 July 2020,cosplaygirl-53045,8," I actually like it
","It is very full on and in your face straight away, which i don't mind. You can tell they want the different girls to have unique stories.. Is it unforgiving, yes. Is that a bad thing, no. I am interested to see where this goes.",/review/rw5906520/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2020,darrel076,8," Some cheese but still a good series.
","This one is worth a watch. The character development is what pulls you in. Some things don't make sense and a little bit of overacting, but the characters are good and no shortage of drama here.",/review/rw5906520/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2020,hypchyck-1,10," Very well done
","This isn't a show I'd normally watch. I'm mixed black/white 45yo educated woman who grew up in Compton, CA with parents who had a great relationship until death did them part, attended private schools. I have one sister, a year and a half younger than me. Our lives went down very different paths. I give my background to assist in understanding my review.",/review/rw5906520/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a great show. The writing and characters are are excellent. Its well filmed and it is worth a watch if you need a new show that is ""binge-worthy"".",/review/rw5906520/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2020,miscellaneousstuff,10," Realistic
","I love this show. It is very realistic in comparison to real life events especially in adult entertainment. Of course it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea, I don't think it's a fair review to bash it; especially if you have little to zero knowledge of what goes on behind the scenes in this type of environment.",/review/rw5906520/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2020,tiannamarie-38182,10," Introspective Look into Strip Culture
",This show is not for the faint of heart! It has nudity and sex scenes so it is for an adult audience. I love the incorporation of a trans lead because they need representation more than ever! It follows the journey of an abused woman who takes on someone else's identity to escape her abuser. She lands at a strip club in a run down town and the drama commences from there!! You have a crooked Mayor; a devious church lady using her daughter to fund the church; and so much more!! I love the melanin dripping in the screen with a virtually all black cast! I'm already excited for season 2.,/review/rw5906520/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2020,thefendiprint,10," Y'all are trippin...
","I don't know if it's misogyny or homophobia or what, but y'all have got to better. This show is very entertaining, the characters and storylines are dynamic, and the music slaps. It's also a darker take on strip club culture, which I loved as well. Y'all just don't like to have fun I guess. I'd probably give this an 8-9, but I'm literally giving this a 10 to even out these unnecessary low ratings.",/review/rw5906520/?ref_=tt_urv

25 August 2021,midnitepantera,7," Jucee Froots theme song is PERFECTION! ;D
","Obviously, a lot of the very low reviews are from people who know Nothing about the Sex industry or strip clubs. And depending what State and Town they are located, the RULES are quite different for the dancers and clients.",/review/rw5906520/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2020,ballard-76670,7," All the reviews in the world won't make you critics
","It's pretty well done, from the acting to the Wrestler-type crazy athleticism. I'm sure if it was a show about mobsters rather than mostly black strippers, the trolls would not be complaining. There's a reason no one cares about your opinion, guys.",/review/rw5906520/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2020,coolcleangreen,9," Hot & Hype, loving this spotlight on stripper life
","Knowing this is fantasy and heightened drama that just happens to be playing out in a strip club setting, I am enjoying the show. Every week the dances are wicked and graceful. It shows the athleticism and effort these women dedicate to their craft. Also, the show dives into realistic issues that pretty women face, especially when the most valued thing about them is their appearance. The show tackles degrading relatives, domestic abuse, war trauma, economic decay, and general desperation to stay afloat in the MS Delta. This is appointment TV I wish I could throw some stacks at!",/review/rw5906520/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2020,b4blue,9," Almost great
","I picked it up out of curiosity. I think it tells a story very well, from the right perspective, encompassing a lot of factors that lead a person to a life of a stripper. It shows the struggles and humanizes them. I would prefer subtitles, because I can't understand what they are saying half the time. Perhaps even a translation of idioms, because it is hard for someone that doesn't live ""in that neighborhood"" to understand the meaning.",/review/rw5906520/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2021,supremekingtorri,8," Pretty Good
","Some of these reviews are ridiculous. One person called Uncle Clifford a transgender, he is not. Another person is saying that they're only portraying black folks as low life essentially, that's wrong. The mayor is black, there's a black lawyer, one of the strippers owns a dance school. The story is much more than just about a strip club.",/review/rw5906520/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2020,mnparker,9," Break-out hit! Ambitious bullseye. Must see.
