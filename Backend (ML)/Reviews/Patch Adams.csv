11 April 2020,cardsrock,6," Cliched, but a reasonably fun time
","Kathyrn Hahn absolutely steals the show in this comedy about moms rebelling. She's a riot and the film somewhat drags when she isn't on screen. It never takes full advantage of its premise, but there's enough talented actors involved to lift it up above most raunchy comedies like this. It won't blow your mind, however you should be able to find some good laughs.",/review/rw3565273/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2016,anaconda-40658,2," Bad Movie.
","Bad Moms (2016): Dir: Jon Lucas, Scott Moore / Cast: Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn, Christina Applegate, Jada Pinkett Smith: Bad movie plainly with a gripe about the tiresome schedule of motherhood. Mila Kunis as Amy Mitchell is the one passable character in this garbage. She caught her husband engaging in Internet sex so she kicks him out and discovers her schedule getting tighter. She makes friends with Kiki, played by Kristen Bell who is meant to be quirky and funny but just comes off as plain annoying. Kathryn Hahn as Carla advocate the need for sex within nearly every word that emerges from her mouth and it grows old quick. Christina Applegate and Jada Pinkett Smith are a total waste as antagonist school board bullies intent on pushing their agenda to the point of even stashing marijuana in the locker of Amy's daughter. The premise is rushed and the structure is predictable and boring. This is bad in more ways than one with two directors committing to a choppy and uninspiring job with production values straight out of the worst of direct-to- video bargain bid deals. Sure, it has a worthwhile message of the stress of motherhood, especially those balancing a job as well but the results here are embarrassing. The film concludes with the actresses sitting with their mothers discussing their upbringings. That is better than anything that appears in the film. This is clearly a film aimed at mothers and for them I say, good luck. This film is lackluster with no sign of an existing screenwriter. Perhaps the mothers could have gathered and wrote something that wasn't this bad. Score: 2 ½ / 10",/review/rw3565273/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2016,Prismark10,2," Bad movie
","Mila Kunis plays a hard working mom with two kids. She juggles her work life which involves endless meetings and working extra hours even though she only works part time with her family life of getting the kids ready for school, doing their homework, picking them up for school and taking them to various activities as well as shopping and cooking.",/review/rw3565273/?ref_=tt_urv

24 October 2017,nogodnomasters,7," I would rather go to Afghanistan than another kid's baseball game
","Amy (Mila Kunis) is the lead ""bad mom."" She can no longer be a ""super mom"" in the Chicago suburbs. She befriends Kiki (Kristen Bell) and Carla (Kathryn Hahn) who are also tired of the whole super mom concept. With Wanda Sykes as a marriage counselor, she is a single mom. Amy butts heads with super mom Gwendolyn (no longer a hot teen Christina Applegate) vindictive president of the P.T.A. Amy is ""good at being late."" This is another over-the-top over-sexed potty mouthed woman comedy. ""Bridesmaids"" establish a successful formula and opened the flood gates for future endeavors, i.e. ""Sister"" and anything with Melissa McCarthy. I am not saying this is bad, but sometimes less is more and originality still counts for something.",/review/rw3565273/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2016,lancelong777,1," Was This Supposed to Be a Comedy
","I honestly don't know what to say about this horrendous, terribly unfunny movie except I wish I could get my money and time back for the waste that was this movie. Here is a suggestion - watch the movie before you release it. And, if it is supposed to be a comedy, make sure the movie makes you laugh. I know for a fact that none of you rich movie producers and stars watched this crappy film. And, if you did and told Mila Kunis that she was funny, I have to say, shame on you for lying to her. And Mila, if you watched this movie and still let them release it - you are a moron. The funniest part is when somebody says a funny word about their body parts and it just wasn't that amusing. I guess the other two people in the room didn't think it was very funny either because I never heard one person laugh for more than a moment. I think I laughed more while watching ""Hannibal."" Do not go to see this pile of crap. It was awful.",/review/rw3565273/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2016,cosmo_tiger,8," One of the funniest movies of the year and one that men and women will both love plus the message doesn't get lost in the comedy.
","""In this day and age it's impossible to be a good mom."" Amy (Kunis) is doing her best to juggle being a mom and having a career. Things begin to pile up and finally hits a breaking point when she is asked to be on a PTA board. Now, taking back control of her life her and her new friends stand up to Gwendolyn (Applegate) and the other perfect moms and let everyone know that it's OK not to be perfect. This is a movie I was was hoping would be funny, but being a guy I wasn't the target audience and wasn't sure if I would relate. I was wrong. This movie is hilarious regardless of what sex your are and being a single dad I can also relate to some of what was being said. At the risk of sounding chauvinistic (which is not my intention) this is a raunchy male sex comedy starring women. The thing this has going for it over most movies like this is that the message doesn't get lost in the comedy and really helps add to the overall enjoyment of this. Overall, one of the funniest movies of the year and one that men and women will both love. That is hard to do in a movie like this. I give this an A.",/review/rw3565273/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2016,Kevin_C1,3," A Bad Movie for Moms
","Five minutes into Bad Moms, I already knew that I had made the wrong choice. I was hoping for a silly comedy staring some actresses I find to be hilarious (Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn.) This was not the case, as most of the jokes are raunchy, cringe-worthy mom jokes.",/review/rw3565273/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2016,CineMuseFilms,6," a lighthearted slapstick comedy on the shaming of stressed-out moms
","The shaming of women is a global phenomenon that unfortunately is part of everyday life. Filmmakers, media and marketing industries prey on women's anxieties about their bodies, and motherhood is another favourite target. While the documentary Embrace (2016) calls out body shaming, the comedy Bad Moms (2016) calls out the impossible standards to which modern mothers are expected to conform. Laughter carries this message more effectively than polemic but make no mistake: while this film is funny it also has serious things to say. ",/review/rw3565273/?ref_=tt_urv

1 July 2017,gwnightscream,6," Good Comedy!
","Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn, Jada Pinkett Smith and Christina Applegate star in this 2016 comedy. Kunis (Ted, That 70's Show) plays Amy, a working mom who never has time for herself. Soon, she and 2 other moms, Kiki (Bell) and Carla (Hahn) decide to relax and have fun by cutting down their everyday routines. Applegate (Anchorman, Married with Children) plays Gwendolyn, an obnoxious, PTA member and Smith (Collateral) plays her friend, Stacy. This is a good comedy with a great cast, especially Kunis & Hahn and the girls' real-life moms also appear at the end credits. I recommend this.",/review/rw3565273/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2016,sergioschout,1," contender of the most horrible movie of 2016
","We had been treated on a real horror-esque fest this summer. From botched up remakes of movies to well bad moms. There are no redeeming qualities. At least the new Ghostbusters had me laughing a bit now and again but this movie is nearly as bad as Himalaya, a three + hour movie i was forced to watch in highschool of how indigenous people herd their yaks over the mountain paths. I never walked out on a movie, except on this one.",/review/rw3565273/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2016,riskitallwinitall,8," ""Bad Moms"" Is A Good Comedy
","Mila Kunis plays an overburdened and stressed mother/wife who has had it with her bratty kids, lazy and cheating husband, a jerk of a boss, and the de facto leader (played by Christina Applegate) of the school that Kunis' kids attends. So one day she decides to no longer put in 100% all day every day, instead being satisfied with just getting by; and laying down the law with all those who have abused her and taken her for granted for so long. What follows is a revelation that no mom is perfect, and it's okay as long as one loves their children and teaches them to be good people. My most memorable, movie moment of ""Bad Moms"" is the scene when Kristen Bell, who plays a mousy mom, finally stands up to her hubby and yells ""And I said, I'm going to the f****ng PTA meeting with my f****ng friends, so stop being such a goddamn p***y and make it work!"" Oh! Oh! Ha ha! ""Bad Moms"" is a hilarious movie that isn't just for women, but for anyone who likes irreverent comedies with a lot of heart.",/review/rw3565273/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2016,rjkjklose,7," Bad Moms but not a bad film.
","The surprise hit ""Bad Moms"" is a comedy starring Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn and is directed by both Scott Moore and Jon Lucas. This movie centers itself around Amy (Mila Kunis) a mother of two who is a bit of a perfectionist. She aspires for her family to have the best that the world can offer. Unfortunately, after a series of bad events everything goes downhill fast. Luckily Amy befriends two other struggling mothers Kiki (Kristen Bell) and Carla (Kathryn Hahn) who work together to try and make some sense of their crazy lives, while having some fun at the same time.

24 August 2016,nyiri-timea,1," What did I just watch?
","Oh my, oh my, where to start. It was supposed to be a comedy still I did not smile ones during the film - and I love smiling so that shouldn't be an impossible mission. At one point I considered I may cry a little because it was so pathetic - the uncircumcised penis scene - but it wasn't even pathetic enough for that. The whole film was nothing - well, at least the first hour, I just couldn't watch the rest of it. It didn't make itself believable enough to be enjoyable as a comedy, because even with a comedy you have to care about the characters or at least believe they could exist in some universe. And if it tried to go the more satiric road than it was too believable for that. I don't know what it was, other than a really bad movie and a complete waste of time and money.",/review/rw3565273/?ref_=tt_urv

9 August 2016,chitownsocialist,1," ABC Family + Frat Boy Humor = Worst Possible Movie Ever
","Wanted a silly comedy for a night out with my best friend. We knew the movie would be bad, but this was so so so much worse. I find movies funny when they contain some authenticity. When I can say, ""Wow, this is over-the-top, but there's a shred of truth here."" Ummm, no. This had the same sentiment as an ABC Family movie, but mixed with the worst frat boy humor available. I doubt whether the writers have actually met mothers. Do they even know their own mothers? I laughed because I was EMBARRASSED. Like, wow, has the world come to this? Please make this movie again but with actual characters and an actual premise. Make it somewhat believable or at least make it funny.",/review/rw3565273/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2016,thomas-junior,1," Horrible
","Just tell me why Mila Kunis ALWAYS has perfect makeup in every movie. She woke up from being super wasted and partying and had not a smudge on her face. Please tell me why it is funny to torment people who work at a super market? Really? I work 40 hours a week getting bad wages so that drunk people can come in and make my job harder? Whoever made this movie is clueless. Why are we basically laughing at these people who suffer in the hourly market. What is funny about that? We are the people that put you in your nice houses. Mila K. should be blocked from making movies. Christina, I expected more from you. This is dumb college humor that is from college kids that flunked out.",/review/rw3565273/?ref_=tt_urv

1 August 2016,Oberrated,4," Sure-fire box office hit.... For the targeted demographic
","Very very unsatisfying film. While it had plenty of moments of comedy that I did laugh at and a number of one liners that worked well. The whole thing fell flat for me. The story was absolutely laughable, and not in the positive way. The climax/feels moment made me feel absolutely nothing because it was stupid to begin with. The love interest of the movie is forced and could be done without entirely. Just almost every plot point was unrealistic and forgetful. To the critical mind, this film falls way short of being anything special. To the targeted demographic that the film focuses on, this film will be a sure fire box office hit to them. So unless you fall within the first bracket and are a film lover, this is an easy pass, ladies and gentleman.",/review/rw3565273/?ref_=tt_urv

20 October 2016,nickk222,7," simply fun
","Don't expect anything new or mind-blowing - it is simply 90 minutes of pure fun. No sophisticated plot - mother of 2 is having hard time balancing her kids, husband and work, so she decides to quit trying to do everything perfect. She stops helping kids with their homework or making their breakfast, kicks out her sort of cheating husband and decides to run for PTA president with help of two new friends - one divorced cougar and one meek housewife. Rated R - only because of strong language, which is not surprising - you can kill 100 people on screen and still be PG, but if you use C*word - you get R-rated ;) Watch it and have fun, brain-relaxing experience.",/review/rw3565273/?ref_=tt_urv
