16 November 2003,bob the moo,," A really nice, funny movie for Christmas despite a little bit of the inevitable smaltz
","Accidentally finding his way into Santa's bad once Christmas Eve, little baby orphan Buddy ends up in the north pole, where he is raised by the elves as one of their own.  As he gets ever bigger and less and less suited to the elf lifestyle he is told about his real father and decides to go to New York to find him.  However Buddy's natural smile and elfish enthusiasm doesn't really fit in with New York, not to mention a father who rejects him.",/review/rw7629472/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2007,moonspinner55,7," A star is born in this laugh-out-loud holiday comedy...
","Charming Christmas confection--about a boy raised by elves in the North Pole who grows up and journeys to N.Y.C. in search of his biological father--puts a clever spin on even the most familiar gags, successfully walking a fine line between absurdist comedy and holiday schmaltz. Will Ferrell looks like a string-bean in yellow tights and, with his mass of curly hair peeking out from underneath his elf's hat, he could easily be used as a walking punchline. Fortunately, director Jon Favreau's handling of ""Elf"" is incredibly nimble, treating Ferrell and his naive character Buddy with the utmost respect; you can laugh at all the silly pranks without ever feeling guilty. Favreau's work is smooth, and he's assembled an incredible supporting cast of character actors to back his star, though some may find the climactic moments (involving Edward Asner as Santa Claus) a bit too literal--and the movie is certainly funnier before we get to this point. Still, the special effects are kept to a minimum in order to let the people shine...and that's not only refreshing, it's heart-warming. *** from ****",/review/rw7629472/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2020,mark.waltz,10," There's magic in the man in green.
","The perfect holiday movie for the cynical New Yorker (or anybody from any other metropolis) is so colorful and cheerful, yet not one that will give you a sugar overdose. It's the story of Buddy the elf, Will Ferrell, an actor I normally can't abide. He's an orphan who crawled into Santa's bag and was adopted by bachelor elf Bob Newhart and when he learns the truth of who he is heads to the Big Apple to locate his father, the cynical James Caan, and ends up finding a family.",/review/rw7629472/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2010,TheLittleSongbird,7," Sweet and charming, salvaged by the cast
","Elf isn't a perfect Christmas movie, but it was sweet and charming with a great cast. The script can be a little too fluffy and unfocused sometimes though, while the pace occasionally lags and some jokes such as Buddy eating the sweets felt forced. However, it does look terrific, with the locations striking and the cinematography very nice. The soundtrack is a nice addition too, it made me nostalgic and all the more ready for Christmas. The story while simple and a tad predictable is at least original and well-meaning, while the direction is credible. The cast is what gives Elf its staying power and charm. Although I am not a fan of Will Ferrell, I think he really shone here as Buddy, while Zooey Deschannel is beautiful and a huge part of the film's charm, James Caan is a suitably gruff father-like figure and Bob Newhart is wonderful. All in all, it is a sweet film if you forgive the slightly clich√© ending, by all means not for all but the cast do save the day. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw7629472/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2015,pyrocitor,8," Reflexive Christmas cheer without the jeer
","At first glance, it's hard to imagine a less likely candidate for an unironic Christmas film than the director/star of the snappy, sardonic Swingers (and soon-to-be director of Iron Man, of all things). Yet, curiously enough, it's this particular background that makes Jon Favreau so well-suited (ha) for the job. Sharp enough not to tumble into the schmaltz too heavily but shrewd enough to recognize the value in playing it straight, Favreau's Elf hits the ideal balance between being fun for kids while clever and sweet enough to remain tolerable for adults without caving to becoming closeted-self-loathing. It's no wonder that such a comparatively recent film has already worked its way into vintage holiday movie canon. ",/review/rw7629472/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2019,patriciogl10,8," Classic Christmas spirit.
","This is the kind of Christmas movie you should be watching every 25th of December apart from your usuals. It's a wonderful story, with a strong Will Ferrell, playing an innocent, child-like, distracted elf who has no idea how the real world functions, as he is on the quest to search for his real family. He is willing to spread the Christmas spirit on a city which apparently hasn't got the spark in its eyes, so there is a hard task on his hands.",/review/rw7629472/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2003,george.schmidt,," An instant holiday classic: Ferrell's crowning achievement to date!
","ELF (2003) *** 1/2 Will Ferrell, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Edward Asner, Bob Newhart, Zooey Daschanel, Daniel Tay, Amy Sedaris, Faizon Love, Andy Richter, Kyle Gass, Michael Lerner, Artie Lange, Peter Billingsley, Peter Dinklage, Claire Lautier, Jon Favreau. Ferrell gives an inspired lunacy turn as a man who was raised by elves at The North Pole and discovers to his dismay he's actually human sparking his quest to be re-united with his long-lost father (Caan in an inspired bit of casting), a 'naughty-list' occupant, who works as a children's book publisher in New York City, just in time for Christmas. Hysterically funny thanks to the goofy yet sweet and wonderful turn by Ferrell (no one else could pull off the razor's edge of looking like an idiot yet retaining the innocent glee of a child and bares a striking resemblance to Tom Hanks' turn in 'BIG') with a great cast especially the beguilingly pretty Daschanel as his fellow Santa's Little Helper at Gimbels'who he falls in love with. Directed with style and witty warmth by Favreau (who has a cameo) and written by newcomer David Berenbaum with a smart, fun script that caters to all ages with a nostalgic nod to classic animated holiday specials for good measure. An instant holiday classic. Trivia note: Billingsley, best known as Ralphie from the yuletide cinematic classic, plays 'A CHRISTMAS STORY' the elf foreman!",/review/rw7629472/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was lucky enough to see in the theater today which was so much fun! Will Ferrell is endlessly entertaining in just about anything. Zooey Deschanel is especially stunning in this role, she's a glow of true beauty. Elf is so much fun as should be to many others too!

22 December 2003,rosscinema,6," This will play on television every year for the rest of our lives
","This is a good natured holiday comedy that definitely is in the same realm as ""The Santa Clause"" and (Dare I say?) ""Miracle on 34th Street"". Story is about a human that has been raised by Santa's elves at the North Pole and as he gets older he figures out that he's very different from the other elves. Years earlier Santa (Ed Asner) was delivering at an orphanage and a human baby accidentally crawled into his sack and was taken back to the North Pole where he was raised by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart). He is called Buddy (Will Ferrell) and he grows to six foot three and one day he is told the truth about his situation and told by Santa who his real father is. Buddy travels to New York City to meet his father and he heads to the Empire State Building where he works. He finds his father Walter (James Caan) who runs a publishing business and works all the time much to the chagrin of his family. Walter is unable to get away from Buddy and after a blood test proves he is his son he takes him home with him to stay with his family. He meets Walter's wife Emily (Mary Steenburgen) and their son and Walter thinks Buddy is just someone reverting to his childhood after a shock. Buddy starts to work in a department store and he meets a woman named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) and is smitten by her. Buddy tries to fit in with the others but finds it difficult although he becomes friends with Walter's son and starts dating Jovie.",/review/rw7629472/?ref_=tt_urv

8 December 2022,SPZMaxinema,8," Rewatched it for the first time in years!!
","I gotta say, while a lot of stuff is quite over the top and a little too silly in the film, a lot of stuff still makes it work as a feel-good comedy and as an adult, I appreciate it a lot more than I did when I was a kid. I like some other Christmas movies better but this one is definitely a good one for the humor alone! Will Ferrell does great as this main character and was a good casting choice. The film even sends a good message toward the end about what love is and how important it is to have enough Christmas spirit! This is the kind of movie fun that is meant for the whole family to enjoy!",/review/rw7629472/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2003,korch-3,7," Elf Will Be A New Christmas Classic!
","After seeing ""Elf"" last night (special preview screening) I am happy to say that I, as well as my children left the theater feeling full of Christmas cheer. I do believe that this movie will become a Christmas classic. I can see this movie being viewed by millions each year on TV just like ""A Christmas Story"", and ""It's a Wonderful Life"". Was the movie perfect? No. Will it win an Oscar? Of course not. Did it make me laugh, and feel good while looking forward to another Christmas this year. Without a doubt.",/review/rw7629472/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2011,planktonrules,8," Enjoyable fluff...very enjoyable fluff!
","""Elf"" is a pretty cute film--but they're starting to overplay it a bit. Just this Christmas season, it's been on TV 1483857 times (give or take 2). And I worry that being shown so much that folks might have a backlash--might start to hate the film even though it's decent family entertainment and is worth your time.",/review/rw7629472/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2018,tavm,7," After so many years, I finally got to watch Elf and consider it quite a funny and partly touching movie
","Confession time: Until just a couple of hours ago, I had never seen this now-classic Christmas comedy starring Will Ferrell in the title role. He's an actual human who as a baby was taken to the North Pole accidentally and was raised by elder elf Bob Newhart. After becoming the least prolific of workers at Santa's Workshop, he decides to go to New York to find his biological father who's played by James Caan. I'll stop there and just say this was quite funny and had also some touching scenes. Because this was a family film, there's no dirty language nor any adult situations. In summary, Elf is a wonderful comedy suitable for kids ""from 1 to 92""!",/review/rw7629472/?ref_=tt_urv

24 June 2004,della-10,10," This is a wonderful, original and perfectly portrayed film.
","This was one of my favorite movies in 2003. Will Ferrell is brilliant as the Elf. The supporting cast is great too, especially Bob Newhart as his elf ""dad"". The characters are well written and it is a refreshing film to get lost in. Will Ferrell plays the elf with such innocence, he is so funny! This is not just a Christmas film but when the DVD comes out I will be watching ""Elf"" in July. The story progresses nicely, there are many lessons to be learned as you watch this movie. It touched my heart in many ways. I highly recommend this movie for kids AND adults, you won't regret it. Treat yourself and watch this ""original"" movie. Hollywood needs to make more like this.",/review/rw7629472/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is an instant classic film. From beginning to end, ( and I mean beginning to end ) is fantastic. The directing, writing and acting. Everything about this film is hilarious, light hearted and fun for the entire family and will live on for generations to come. From the jokes in the narration to the final conclusions in the end, everything about Elf just works flawlessly. Elf is a very out of pocket film to be as good as it is, and really shouldn't be. But nevertheless, Elf is just a perfect film. Will Ferrell did his absolute best in this film and you can tell why. Overall this is a must watch film for everyone who likes anything funny.",/review/rw7629472/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is slowly becoming my favorite holiday film. I mean, there's a lot of competition for that title. Miracle on 34th Street, it's a Wonderful Life, The Man Who Came to Dinner, Alistair Sims' Christmas Carol, Muppet Christmas Carol, The Santa Clause (#1), White Christmas... the list goes one. Elf is so well-crafted and excellently helmed by Jon Favreau in his first spin as Director, that I consider it to be totally flawless. I might just be obsessed with it. Get your family together and enjoy this one. Over and over and over and over.",/review/rw7629472/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2021,goshamorrell,10," A classic that needs to be seen every December.
","If I were to tell you ""Elf"" stars Will Ferrell as a human named Buddy who thinks he is an elf and Ed Asner as Santa Claus, would you feel an urgent desire to see this film? Neither did I. I thought it would be clunky, stupid and obvious, like ""The Santa Clause 2"" or ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas."" It would have grotesque special effects and lumber about in the wreckage of holiday cheer, foisting upon us a chaste romance involving the only girl in America who doesn't know that a man who thinks he is an elf is by definition a pervert. That's what I thought it would be. It took me about 10 seconds of seeing Will Ferrell in the elf costume to realize how very wrong I was. This is one of those rare Christmas comedies that has a heart, a brain and a wicked sense of humor, and it charms the socks right off the mantelpiece. Even the unexpected casting is on the money. James Caan as the elf's biological father. Yes! Bob Newhart as his adoptive elf father. Yes! Mary Steenburgen as Caan's wife, who welcomes an adult son into her family. Yes! Zooey Deschanel as the girl who works in a department store and falls for his elfin charm. Yes! Faizon Love as Santa's elf manager -- does it get any better than this? Yes, it does. Peter Dinklage, who played the dwarf in ""The Station Agent,"" has a brief but sublime scene in which he cuts right to the bottom line of elfhood. ""Elf,"" directed by Jon Favreau and written by David Berenbaum, begins with a tragic misunderstanding on a Christmas long ago. As Santa Claus is making his rounds, a human orphan crawls into his sack and accidentally hitches a ride to the North Pole. Raised as an elf by Papa Elf (Newhart), he knows he's at least four feet taller than most of the other elves, and eventually he decides to go to New York City and seek out his birth father. Indeed the whole world has grown too cynical, which is why Santa is facing an energy crisis this year. His sleigh is powered by faith, and if enough people don't believe in Santa Claus, it can't fly. That leads to one of those scenes where a flying machine (in this case, oddly enough, the very sleigh we were just discussing) tries to fly and doesn't seem to be able to achieve takeoff velocity, and ... well, it would be a terrible thing if Santa were to go down in flames, so let's hope Buddy persuades enough people to believe. It should be easy. He convinced me that this was a good movie, and that's a miracle on 34th street right there. Of course there's a big scene involving Buddy's confrontation with the department store Santa Claus, who (clever elf that he is) Buddy instantly spots as an imposter. ""You sit on a throne of lies!"" he tells this Santa.",/review/rw7629472/?ref_=tt_urv
