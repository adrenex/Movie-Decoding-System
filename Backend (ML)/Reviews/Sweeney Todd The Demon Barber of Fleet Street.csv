11 May 2021,TheLittleSongbird,4," Very rough around the edges and with not much heart of gold
","The 1955 'Lady and the Tramp' film is still wonderful. Loved it as a little girl and to this day it is still my second favourite 50s Disney film after 'Sleeping Beauty'. Disney have been very variable when it comes to their live action remakes, tending to be visually impressive but not necessary and lacking the heart of the originals (some also suffering from trying to do too much or being too faithful). This is probably not a popular opinion, but of the remakes only 'The Jungle Book' and 'Cinderella' were above good.",/review/rw6341946/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2020,Kirpianuscus,," manifesto
","The main impression - this live action version is only a multicultural manifesto, using as pretext only, the original Disney animation. I am not a fan of the live action versions because each of them is far by the poetry of the original. In this case, the sacrifices for a multicultural manifesto are too many and too much. And this is an obvious sin. In my case, for the lost of the beautiful - spices song of the Siamese cats. The virtues - the beautiful opening, F. Murray Abraham, Rose as the expected Lady and, sure, Yvette Nicole Brown performance.",/review/rw6341946/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2019,joriethomas,4," Just why
","I was hesitant about this movie, lady and the tramp was my grandma's favorite Disney movie and since she passed, it's Casey personal to me. I walked in aware that there were changes to be more inclusive and tried to not let that bother me but let's be real, why did Jaque have to be a girl? Why did the darling child have to be a girl? Why did they have to have an interracial relationship during a time period where that would've been illegal? I agree with another comment, update the time period then. I'm not Asian so I get that it might not be my place but was the we are siamese part that bad that it had to be omitted and replaced with what imo was offensive to black people?! One of my biggest gripes honestly was I think lady's voice was miscast. Lady had a delicate and sweet voice and I think they should've done that in this one too, she was a delicate little lady which was the basis for the majority of the movie. Honestly, my 4 stars was for the fact that 1 it's not unwatchable and 2 that they cast Sam Elliott as trusty and didn't mess with his character and 3 I loved Ken Jeong's character. Otherwise, this was a miss.",/review/rw6341946/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2019,misspaigenelson,1," Seriously?
","If you're going to call it a ""re-imagination"" then ""re-imagine"" the whole thing. Don't keep it virtually the same and then change only a few things to fit your agenda. And just in case you were wondering, a Siamese cat is a breed. That should not be offensive and is literally the equivalent of it being a French Bulldog singing ""I am French, if you please"". Seriously ridiculous. Stop trying to make everything PC and make a good movie for once like Walt used to.",/review/rw6341946/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2019,boggie4758,3," what the heck Disney
","Where to begin. Lets start with interracial marriage. It did bother me unlike some people not because it was interracial but it's because Disney stuck that in there that made no sense. If it took place in more modern time it would be fine but not at the turn of the century..it was not allowed and these people would have been arrested. What was up with the cat song. As a child I loved that song. It was as they were trying to whitewash some things and not others. Really why make Jock a girl...what a stupid move. This didn't even hold a candle to the cartoon version not even close...I did like the Lion King, Jungle Book. I thought they were fairly good..but this thing no....",/review/rw6341946/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2019,sonarluv,4," It's just not the same!
","You might find this movie somewhat enjoyable, if you haven't seen the original; but in comparison, it is really lacking. Some of the best moments from the original, have been completely removed, while others have just been changed; unfortunately those changes are terrible.",/review/rw6341946/?ref_=tt_urv

14 November 2019,xtianarsonist,2," Reinventing the wheel.
","This film is lackluster and completely unnecessary. I had no problem with an interracial couple, except that they are still living in the early 1900's. I'm pretty sure that sort of thing was illegal in most states at that time. Why not update the story to 2019? Or even the 80's or 90's? It's difficult to be culturally diverse when you are setting a film in lily white turn of the century midwestern society. At the end of the day this is just a watered down copy of the original. Is the Siamese cat depiction offensive? Sure. It is what it is for the times, though. I think it's important to see stuff like that and remember how myopic society was not so long ago.",/review/rw6341946/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2019,djones0305,6," About what you'd probably expect
","Once again Disney's live action remake of a classic animated movie hits the ""well alright"" mark. This definitely isn't an awful movie. The opening is actually pretty lovely, and overall the movie has a lot of nice aesthetic to it throughout. The few songs are honestly fine. Not really cringy or anything, they don't waste time on these really. The CGI of the dogs is kind of hit or miss. Some scenes it's actually pretty believable and looks great, others it can be a bit wonky. But the movie also lacks what visual luster an animated film brings, not to mention that this version is a bit longer than the animated, so the movie ends up feeling a bit laggy and drawn out. A few chuckle worthy moments, and it does pick up a bit near the end, but overall a very meh, good for playing in the background during casual night, movie. Remember this is a straight-to-video release, and you won't really face much disappointment.",/review/rw6341946/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2020,Eiriksterminator,," Way to ruin a classic.
","They basically changed everything...For the worse...Jock is now a girl, for god knows what reason. Which of course means the proposal scene has to be removed. Worse, they changed his(her) character into one that spends her time getting painted by her silly owner, instead of being the wise old dog he is supposed to be. At least he/she still speaks Scottish...",/review/rw6341946/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2021,jenny_mullin,2," Errrr....
","Am I missing something but since when was it deemed acceptable for an interracial couple, in the 1900s, to marry, live together and furthermore have children without so much of a blink of an eye?",/review/rw6341946/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2020,joeyg-149-99444,1," Awful
","The animation is terrible, they would have been better off utilizing the techniques used in Homeward Bound. The script is terrible, just terrible. Everything feels like they tried their best to look progressive over being realistic to the time period or even remotely true to the story. The only thing they did right was the shot for shot remake of the only scene they apparently thought anyone would care about...the spaghetti scene. Don't bother with this. This is their worst attempt at a live action remake of their classics. It's just garbage.",/review/rw6341946/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2020,ellamsmith,2," Seriously Disney??
","Remember lady and the tramp? The adorable tale of two dogs falling in love, a true classic that made up so many childhoods. Well forget all of that because Disney need to dumb down and trample on it for the sake of profit!
I remember rewatching the original over and over again and never getting tired of it. Although when it came to this I watched half of it (about 3 months ago) and have yet to get back to it!
I watched this with my mum - who doesn't mind these remakes - but even she couldn't defend this one!",/review/rw6341946/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2021,metalgear800,," Dumb, cheesy and pointless
","What is the purpose of making a remake if it's way worse in absolutely every way?
The animation is atrocious, the voice acting is lousy and annoying and the writing is just terrible and utterly cheesy. Furthermore, this remake is politically correct garbage all the way. What's with the role hand-outs to black people? I mean, half the cast is black and the Lady's owners are a black and white couple. Is that supposed to be a truthful representation of the early 1900's (and the remake) which this movie is set in? I really wish Disney would just stop making garbage like this. It's kind of like when Kim Jong-un removed his uncle from all pictures he was in. It was supposed to be like he never existed but was obvious what had happened. This is kind of similar but worse. The pinnacle of this idiocy being that aunt Sarah criticizes Jim Dear for being a musician while his wife is a house keeper all the while they live in a rather nice house. Also, if there was one thing they should've changed it should've been those ridiculous names Jim Dear and Darling. This remake is just dumb, pointless and especially annoying to watch.",/review/rw6341946/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2019,Hollywood_Yoda,5," Expected More From Disney
","When I heard about this film coming out, I was really excited about seeing it, as I was with the live action Lion King and Aladdin. However, much like the 2019 version of The Lion King, it was more disappointment.",/review/rw6341946/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2019,mary-lyn007,7," Yes, the original's better, but it's still not bad...
","Lady and the Tramp is probably my favorite of the original batch of Disney animated movies (Aladdin's my favorite of the ones they made after I was born). However, I have to agree with some of the other criticisms of the movie. Based on the time in which they set the film, is kinda hard to believe that Jim Dear and Darling would've lived in such a nice house and had so many friends come over for the baby shower. Interracial couples just weren't a thing really in the early 1900s. They just weren't. Not in places where there were riverboats. And maybe it was because I was a kid when I saw the movie The first time, but I never realized that the Siamese cat's song was rude or offensive, but I'm also not Asian so that might contribute to it too. It would've been nice if they'd tried to fix the lyrics for the song rather than scrap it altogether. The thing they replaced it with, and what was UP with the animation of those cats, it was just weird, was unimpressive. I was also confused by their making Jock a girl, though I always thought it was spelled Jaques, I have no problem with it on the whole, it was just an ""oh, I guess he's a girl now, ok."" But what happened to Beaver?!",/review/rw6341946/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2019,Clairepcb,5," Disney agenda
","Unfortunately Disney has decided it will infiltrate it's agenda with all its new movies or at least this movie and the new Lion King. This one is especially embarrassing because the era doesn't work as every other reviewer has stated. Please Disney, do some test reviews before you go this far out of what's believable by the viewer or shift the story line so that it works better. I can't imagine the ticket sales you lost over this. And BTW, It's okay to represent society accurately from a demographic standpoint.",/review/rw6341946/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2019,hotrobinproductions,5," When is this going to end?
","I couldn't bare another minute. I was a fan once of Disney bringing previous creations to life. They've done it with 101 Dalmatians, Peter Pan, and plenty other films but nowadays it's so much at once and they really want to force these animal adaptions, maleficent was solid, cinderella, Jungle book, Beauty and the beast, Christopher Robin were also all pretty good, they worked very well with jungle book as far as the animal recreations. But ever since 2019 it's been going downhill. Maybe it's because they're really pushing the envelope with these films all at once. Literally a live action Disney film once a year was good enough. But this year we've gotten 4 live action adaptions so Disney can make more money off of stuff they already made. It's absurd, Dumbo was mediocre, Aladdin was ehh, lion king was a huge disappointment and this is even worse. Shame on you disney and I can't believe you people buy this crap. This is garbage period.",/review/rw6341946/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2020,kuangzao,5," boring
","Sometimes the effects are good, the dogs have more expression than the animals in the live action Lion King. But the acting from everyone was half-assed, the emotional moments did not have that much significance on the plot and it's overall a boring and forgettable film",/review/rw6341946/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2019,jimkennyeverett-691-760833,3," Unnecessary Dissapointment
","Apart from some nice star voices, this seemed just too polished for its own good with some sickly sweet moments and cheesy acting from some of the Humans involved. With Jarring and unnecessary PC changes and missing some of the best bits from the Original, this just missed the mark completely for me. Disney should really have updated the setting rather than keep the early 1900s period as many have said before. Some good CGI just doesn't cover the cracks of another terrible, disappointing remake / re-imagining of a classic original. Either watch and forget or better still, just watch the original instead.",/review/rw6341946/?ref_=tt_urv

","Obviously a lot of people are sick of your political crap Disney!!! This movie was a disgrace from start to finish. You are here for one reason and one reason only. To entertain. Not to push your political agenda. This is exactly why you are losing viewers and fans by the second. Get back to basics before we stop going to your parks and forget you like we did the NFL.
