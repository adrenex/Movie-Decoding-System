","Stuart Pearson (Kevin Nealon) heads with his family to spend a summer vacation in Creek Landing, Michigan, with his brother Nathan Pearson (Andy Richter) and his sons and their mother Rose (Doris Roberts) in an old lake house they had rented. When the television has trouble with the image, Stuart's son Tom (Carter Jenkins) and the arrogant boyfriend of his sister Ricky Dillman (Robert Hoffman) go to the attic and then to the roof, where Tom meets his cousin Jake (Austin Butler) and they find the antenna dish totally destroyed. Sooner they discover four alien invaders that are preparing an invasion of the Earth that use a mind control weapon that only affects adults and they lock the quartet in the attic.

","I'm in my twenties, and I loved this film. If you look at the title and the cover and know for certain you won't like it, then you probably won't. But if you think you might, then I'd recommend giving it a try, because I was a little unsure but I thoroughly enjoyed it.",/review/rw4772459/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2009,kosmasp,6," Silly
","You really have to find your inner child, when you watch this. And really, why would you watch this expecting anything else then a silly little comedy? It delivers on that premise and has either good actors to support some crazy humor (I forgot her name, but one of the ""Golden Girls"") or some crazy idea (a device that ... well you see, if you watch the movie)!

","A couple of days ago I took my 11 and 6 year old grandsons to see this movie in Oceanside, California. Suffice it to say that I did NOT decide to go jump off the nearby Oceanside Pier when the film was over. Sure, it's no world-beater. On the other hand, I was somewhat surprised that the movie was better than I had expected.",/review/rw4772459/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2017,WeAreLive,9," Great movie
","Ignore all the bad reviews on here this is a really great movie for kids and teenagers to watch. 
The CGI in this movie was great. Voice actors for the alien voices were pretty spot on. The acting for this movie was great.
I am not going to spoil anything but I am going to say if you want to have a good Sci-Fi movie which both kids and adults can watch i would recomand this film.",/review/rw4772459/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2009,kpayne27,7," Good movie
","I am a mom with four children. My one-year-old didn't go with us, but my five-year-old, ten-year-old, and twelve-year-old went with me to see this movie. I must say it was refreshing to see a children's movie that was actually suitable for children to watch. We thought certain scenes were very cute and funny, there was no foul language, and my children enjoyed this film. It is sad that so many other movies get attention when this one is entertaining and clean. I would recommend it and think it is better than a lot of other summer films we have seen. On a scale of one to ten, I would probably give it a seven. That is an honest evaluation based on action, entertainment, humor, and story line. Overall, not a bad movie at all.",/review/rw4772459/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2009,dtucker86,," a good film for the whole family
","I couldn't believe the mean comments by some of the other people posted here. Every once in a while its good to see a film that makes you feel like a kid again. I think thats called appealing to your inner child. Yes this movie doesn't have a believable story or great special effects, but come on folks. I saw this film today and the kids in the theater were laughing and having a ball. It appeals to them because in the movie that kids are the heroes SPOILER ALERT who stop the aliens, outsmart the adults and save the world. I thought it was so cute in the film how that little girl bonded with one of the aliens. It was sad when they said goodbye, a real tearjerker. I also enjoyed the slapstick in the film especially with the arrogant jock, it was nice seeing him humbled like that. Kevin Nealon, who used to be on Saturday Night Live, has a good part in this as a well meaning but dorky father. I also wanted to mention the noted character actress Doris Roberts who plays the grandmother, she was on my parent's favorite show Everybody Loves Raymond. There is a scene in this film where the aliens possess her and she turns into a superhero and kicks butt. It is the single funniest scene I have witnessed in a film this entire year. I thought I would fall out of my seat! I'll bet Ms. Roberts had a ball making this film. I'm glad I went to see this film and highly recommend it. It wont win any Golden Globes or Oscars and the American Film Institute will never consider it a classic but it will make you laugh and feel good after the credits roll, isn't that why we go to the movies?",/review/rw4772459/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2009,matus92,6," Enjoyable Children's Film
","As my title implies, most children will find this film enjoyable. I went to see it with my younger brother and he loved it. Does ""Aliens in the Attic"" have content the parents would enjoy? Not really, and no it doesn't have the depth of humour that Pixar or the older Disney films have. It's just a fun kids comedy with plenty of slapstick to keep them amused throughout.",/review/rw4772459/?ref_=tt_urv

","You can tell they really mean FAMILY film when 10 of the characters are named Pearson. They are Nana Rose, her 2 adult sons Stuart and Nathan, Nathan's wife Nina, their kids Bethany, Tom, and little Hannah, and Nathan's sons Jake and twins Art and Lee. The story is told mainly from the perspective of Tom (Carter Jenkins), a geeky mathlete who, as the story starts out, is regretting his decision to bomb this semester's high-school classes so he can concentrate on trying to be cool (unlike his dad), an uphill battle.",/review/rw4772459/?ref_=tt_urv

","I love this movie! It's great for the whole family. It has action, comedy, and great actors/actresses! Robert Hoffman is so amazing as Ricky! Every time he was on, I laughed so hard. The twin boys were funny also. This movie will not fail to make you laugh and smile. Give it a try!",/review/rw4772459/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2009,deanbean317,1," My little brother fell asleep!
","Kids today...even a nine year old, have been weaned on Spidey and Iron Man so even they know crappy CGI when they see it. Take my word for it, you see it in this movie from beginning to end! I had to stomach this smoldering pile for the sake of a younger child and in the end we BOTH felt ripped off. Here's a hint; if you're going to make a movie where the main character is a special effect, please try to make him more believable than Speedy Alka-Seltzer from a forty year old television commercial. I could even forgive the bargain basement effects if the acting and storytelling weren't three notches below thatÂ¡ The two ten star reviews with almost the exact same wording in each are obviously plants from the studio (and I'm not a conspiracy nut). They both seem to be pushing this as a children's move that children will love that is made especially for your children. You'll recognize the reviews I mean since they each mention ""children"" ten times in each one. ""Caveat emptor""",/review/rw4772459/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2011,kbowman-3,9," Pleasant Family Film with Laugh-Out Loud Moments
","I confess that I don't understand the negative ratings for this film. Maybe you need to watch this film with your kids to appreciate it. Overall I found this a very enjoyable family film, with good work by some fine comic actors. Doris Neely is very funny. Andy Richter and Tim Meadows also give good comedic performances. And there are some moments of pure physical humor in this film that are genuinely laugh-out-loud funny. Robert Hoffman, as Ricky, gives an amazing physical performance that reminds me of a young Jim Carrey. I am surprised that more attention has not been paid to his movie-stealing performance. There are a handful of moments in this film that had the entire audience laughing uncontrollably. What more can you ask from a comedy? There are the kind of moments where your kids will ask you to rewind and watch it again. Why? You ain't seen nothing until you've seen Funky Ricky.",/review/rw4772459/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2020,dianastormo,10," So underrated!
","I can't believe how many people bash this movie- it's very entertaining. Actually, it's hilarious! I watch it every summer. The scenes with Robert Hoffman and Ashley Tisdale are laugh out loud funny. Especially the end. #FunkyRicky",/review/rw4772459/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2009,Pumpkin_Man,10," An Extremely Awesome Film!!!
","I absolutely loved this movie! I loved the comedy, the storyline, the action, the effects, everything! This may be my 3rd favorite movie of 2009 behind Friday the 13th and Land of the Lost! I've seen a lot of negative reviews toward this movie, but some people take things a little too seriously. This movie is for the kid in all of us. While on summer vacation, the Pearson family go to three-story holiday house in the middle of nowhere. The kids; Hannah, Tom, and Bethany don't wanna go, but they are forced to. They meet more family members like Jake, Art, and Lee. When Bethany's boyfriend forces Tom to the roof, they see the aliens who want to take over the world. Throughout the day, the kids try to stop them, without their parents finding out. One alien, Sparks is not a threat to the humans and decides to become friends with Hannah. Sparks is a cute little alien, unlike Skip, Tazer, and Razor. Will the Pearson children stop the evil aliens from taking over the world? I highly recommend ALIENS IN THE ATTIC!!!",/review/rw4772459/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2012,neil-476,8," Great fun
","Tom is a put-upon teenager. Always in Dad's bad books, at odds with sister Bethany and her boyfriend Ricky (who is nice as pie to Mom and Dad, but horrible to Tom), he hates having to go with them on holiday to a lakeside house with his uncle and domineering cousin (plus hi young sister and cousin twins). The awfulness continues as the holiday starts and then gets worse as the holiday house turns out to be the destination of a small alien invasion advance party. And small is the key word - these guys are barely shin high, but they are incredibly aggressive. Tom knows nobody will believe him, but it turns out all the kids (except Bethany) have to join together to combat the aggressors, especially when it turns out that the aliens can fire a dart which makes people from Ricky's age upwards (which excludes the kids) controllable via a video game controller.",/review/rw4772459/?ref_=tt_urv

5 April 2012,jboothmillard,6," Aliens in the Attic
","I saw the trailer for this film during the tine it was released in cinemas, and I thought it looked like something that would be either very cheesy or just complete rubbish, so I watched it to see what I would ultimately think. Basically, in the suburbs of Michigan, Tom Pearson (Carter Jenkins) is the often troublesome young teenager of his family: father Stuart (Kevin Nealon), mother Nina (Gillian Vigman), seven year old sister Hannah (Ashley Boettcher) and older sister Bethany (High School Musical's Ashley Tisdale). The family are heading to a holiday home in Creek Landing for some good old fashioned summer togetherness, joined also by Uncle Nathan 'Nate' (Andy Richter), his son Jake (Austin Butler), identical twin cousins Art and Lee (twins Henri and Regan Young) and Nana Rose (Doris Roberts). They are also joined by Bethany's arrogant and older boyfriend Ricky Dillman (Robert Hoffman), and he shows his true colours to Tom when are told to go up to the attic and onto the roof to fix the television satellite. It is is on the roof they see the landing of small space pods, and four small aliens, the ""Zirkonians"", come out, tough commander Skip (J. K. Simmons), muscle-bound dude Tazer (Kari Wahlgren), lethal female soldier Razor (Thomas Haden Church), and technician and non threatening Sparks (Josh Peck). Soon enough the aliens turn vicious and make it clear they are on Earth to take it over, and Ricky gets captured with a mind control devise put on him, they use him like a robot/puppet to get their own way. Soon enough all five of the young characters have seen the alien invaders, and Tom appoints himself leader, and they manage to find out that the mind control devices only work on adult minds, so they are determined to make sure they won't capture them. The adults would not believe any explanations the younger characters try to tell them, so they are on their own, and they defend themselves with makeshift weapons, such as a potato launcher, and they also find a way to use the mind control device on Ricky. The adults are completely unaware of anything going on in the attic or anywhere else in the house as they want the kids to spend their time fishing and getting out and about. Hannah gets close to Sparks, the one alien that doesn't seem nasty at all, and the other young characters come to trust him as well, as he hates the battle going on, and he wants to go back to his home world and to his own family. Jake gets captured and tied up in the basement, and Nana Rose gets a mind control device put on her, giving her body more agility and strength, and the aliens use her body with the kids using Ricky's body in a fight. Bethany finally finds out what is going on as well after seeing the fight and the aliens, and Sparks makes them more high tech weapons, but the aliens reveal their most powerful weapon, a device that increases their size. After defeating the grown and then shrunk leader Skip, and Tazer and Razor, and the invasion called off, the aliens return to their home planet, including Sparks who says a sad goodbye to Hannah. The vacation finally returns to normal, Tom and his father reconcile with each other, they all enjoy their fishing at last, and Bethany and Tom both join forces to get revenge on Ricky, who still has the mind control device in him, and they make him look a complete idiot. Also starring Tim Meadows as Sheriff Doug Armstrong, Malese Jow as Julie and Megan Parker as Brooke. The cast is fine, the special effects are relatively good, and it is a simple story that can be enjoyed, what made it great fun were the inventive and ridiculous jokes, such as the slapstick fight sequences, and the pop culture references, and especially the mind control moments - with Hoffman's silly faces, both the children and adults watching will love it, a hilarious and fun science-fiction fantasy adventure comedy.

27 April 2012,ayoreinf,7," despite king size plot holes the movie works
","I've recently seen a series of poor productions for kids, so I know for a fact this one is better than many others. The characters are well written and the actors do their job well, both the young ones and the older ones. The story has huge plot holes, just one example is the language the aliens speak, they seem to have trouble with English but on the other hand they speak it among themselves. There're more such goofs but I can't specify without adding spoilers, so I'll just say, that despite this fact, since the characters themselves are real and convincing, the whole thing does work, it's quick enough for the viewers not to notice these inconsistencies and it is funny and exciting. All together - not a bad viewing",/review/rw4772459/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2009,brownah18,7," One family movie that it's so bad once you see it.
","The Pearson family go to their cabin every summer. Tom Pearson played by Carter Jenkins tries to get out of going by failing his classes and demanding that he needs to study more. Kevin Nealon who plays Stuart Pearson confronts Tom and tells him everyone has to go, its tradition. After just getting to the cabin with the whole Pearson family Bethany Pearson (Ashley Tisdale) boyfriend Ricky Dillman (Robert Hoffman) rolls into the driveway to see Bethany. The cable goes out and Tom and Ricky are told to go fix it, what they didn't expect is to find the satellite blown up and four aliens pop out from nowhere. The aliens get control of Ricky with their dart guns and try to stop Tom and Jake Pearson (as Austin Butler) from getting back inside. After being let back in by the two twins Art Pearson ( Henri Young) and Lee Pearson (Regan Young) they try and fend off the aliens from getting inside the house. Recently seeing Tisdale in High School Musical 3, she is taking on some different roles now. Playing the older sister in this movie which she does really good at. Also a girlfriend to Robert Hoffman's character Ricky who recently i saw in Step Up 2. Im curious to see how Tisdales career pans out too and maybe she will do something more with music in future movies that she does. This movie is fun to watch and has Doris Roberts playing the grandma which was funny. All in all this is a good family movie and one that would not hurt to check out.

","No it is not E.T. but this film derives from the source. We all have a complex image of what other life out there may look like and this film brings in a relative cuteness to the aliens. It is a very cute film with humor and kids style action. Good dialogue, solid plot and moral compass of needing to come together as a family more.",/review/rw4772459/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2009,barrys82,5," Enjoyable children movie
","Aliens in the Attic is a movie that entertains for maybe 30 minutes. After that time I think that it turns a little foolish, unreal and very childish. the movie tells the story of a very dysfunctional family that rent a house on the lake for their vacations, what they don't know is that the house is already habit by a group of aliens looking for a device to invade and conquer the Earth. The aliens can control the mind of adult people but not of teenagers and children, so it is the children of the family to protect their house, their family and the whole world. The story is very predictable, from the very beginning you can tell what is going to happen. The cast is good, the performances not that much. I love the role of Doris Roberts as the Grandma, she is very funny, Kevin Nealon is also very food as the dad. I think that it is already time for Ashley Tisdale to leave behind the roles of the spoiled high school teenager and the kids were good enough specially the little girl Ashley Boettcher. In conclusion, Aliens in the Attic is an entertaining and enjoyable movie specially for kids, then if you don't have kids or you're not one avoid it or wait for it until its on DVD.",/review/rw4772459/?ref_=tt_urv
