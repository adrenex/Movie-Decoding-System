8 June 2002,Buddy-51,," a sterling comic gem
","I think I smiled all the way through `About a Boy,' a comic near-masterpiece derived from the best-selling novel by Nick Hornby.  For the sake of accuracy, both the novel and the film should more rightly be titled `About TWO Boys,' since the story focuses not only on 12-year old Marcus, but on 38-year old Will, a man totally dedicated to the proposition that any man who so desires can live quite happily on his own private little urban island, thank you very much.  Will's `island' is his own London flat, which he has equipped with all the accoutrements of comfort and diversion that modern technology  in the form of computers, big screen TV's and DVD players - can afford.  Who needs people when you have so much `stuff' to keep you content and occupied?  Will thrives in his environment, much to the chagrin of his married couple friends who keep insisting that he must certainly be miserable without a wife and family to give his life meaning. But Will loves being shallow  a fact of his personality he is more than willing to declare right up front  and the last thing he needs  or thinks he needs  is people to clutter it up.  Yet, island dwellers have a tendency not to remain marooned for long, and, before he knows it, Will finds himself striking up a relationship with a lonely, backward boy named Marcus, whose mother suffers from serious bouts of suicidal depression.",/review/rw3102187/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2011,TheLittleSongbird,8," Very, very good
","The book is an excellent read, while more extensive in its story elements and structure, it is funny, moving and compelling. The movie is also very, very good. I personally would have liked the first half of the movie especially to have slowed down a tad, some of it felt rushed and skimmed through. And while it is not as extensive or quite as developed as the book, it is every bit, if not more so, as funny, moving and as compelling. The whole movie is beautifully filmed, the soundtrack is beguiling, the excellent is suitably adroit and the script is funny, sharp and witty. And the more poignant scenes were genuinely so. The whole cast give sterling performances, Hugh Grant is on excellent form, and Nicholas Hoult is very believable as the troubled boy. Sharon Small, Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz also are solid. All in all, a very good film. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw3102187/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2002,jhclues,9," Effective, Satisfying Film
","Being afforded a life of independent means can be a blessing in some regards, perhaps, but it can also be the definitive test of one's character. If one chooses to use such a situation toward altruistic ends, or at the very least a venture that can provide some personal fulfillment, it says something about who that person is.  On the other hand, if one squanders the opportunity on a totally self-absorbed, shallow existence, it says even more.  And while taking the latter path may provide some interesting moments, it's a cosmetically created, external bubble that serves no other purpose than covering up an empty life, and sooner or later-- to anyone with even a modicum of intelligence-- that bubble is bound to burst; and when it finally happens, when the wake-up call comes, how one responds to it is the ultimate test of character, which is what happens to a such a man in `About A Boy,' directed by Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz, and starring Hugh Grant.",/review/rw3102187/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2004,Superunknovvn,9," Wonderful book, wonderful movie - gotta love Nick Hornby!
","This movie really came as a surprise to me. I had read the book shortly before I saw it and when I heard Hugh Grant was going to star and the Weitz brothers were chosen to direct I didn't exactly have high hopes. I thought ""American Pie"" was funny and all but this kind of story demanded someone more mature, someone clever. This movie, however, turned out to be all that: mature, clever, witty, sensible, honest and, most of all, really funny in such a natural way. Hugh Grant has never been better in any role before or since and the soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy is just perfect for the movie. The only thing they overdid a little was Toni Collette's character. I've never seen a person like that in real life. What I did like was the way they changed the ending for the movie. Usually that's not a good idea but it totally worked here. After all, I still liked ""High Fidelity"" a tiny bit better (the movie, not the book), but ""About A Boy"" comes very close. If you are just as much a fan of this book/movie as I am, get the DVD. There are wonderful deleted scenes on it, which are as funny as the rest of the movie.",/review/rw3102187/?ref_=tt_urv

23 May 2002,jotix100,8," Boys will be boys....
","I was a bit scared about what kind of treatment Chris and Paul Weitz had given the great novel by Nick Hornby. I have to report they did a great job in bringing it to the screen with the help of the screenwriter, Peter Hedges III. It's amazing what they have accomplished in translating the book to the screen and not lose focus in doing so. A great many Hollywood brains should take note of what was accomplish in this film.",/review/rw3102187/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2002,bob the moo,," Yet another spot-on Hornby adaptation
","Selfish, self-centered rich `kid' Will Freeman lives alone as an island in London, living off royalties from his father's record.  When a new dating trick sees him targeting single mothers because they are easier to dump he unwittingly gets mixed up with Marcus.  Marcus is a 12 year old who is bullied at school because of his hippy life style (forced on him by his mother) and struggles at home with his depressed, suicidal mother.  At first he sees himself helping his mum by getting Will to like her but gradually Marcus and Will get used to each other and have lessons that both can learn.",/review/rw3102187/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2002,Chris_Docker,7," Hugh Grant gets a decent script where he can do what he does best and doesn't have to stutter
","Described by some as a man's version of Bridget Jones Diary the  remarkable thing is that it lives up to the description. Hugh Grant,  with an excellent script that could have been written especially for  him, plays a young confirmed single yuppie socialite, dividing his day  into units in which to pack his meaningless but carefree, philandering  lifestyle and disposable income. After initially discovering unmarried  mothers as a new supply of grateful sexual objects, he becomes drawn  into a meaningful life after making friends with a young boy. Avoiding  a cheesy ending is one of the film's many triumphs.",/review/rw3102187/?ref_=tt_urv

","Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) thinks of himself as a self-sufficient island. He doesn't need any connections or dependents. He's never worked a real job in his life, living off the royalties of his father one big hit song. After a setup by his sister, he finds that single moms make for the best dating potential. Marcus Brewer (Nicholas Hoult) is a freakish outcast at his school, and his mother is suicidal. Will and Marcus are brought together by a lie and a single parent help group.",/review/rw3102187/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2002,Aidan McGuinness,," Hugh Grant in non-annoying role shock! And he's quite funny too
","`About a Boy' was being touted as a great make over for Hugh Grant and it is. Gone is his infamous bumbling English fop role, his fluffy hair lost to a sharp, more stylish cut. Here he plays a rich selfish layabout, Will, who cruises through life on the royalties from a song his deceased father penned years ago. He finds a great way to meet women who don't want to get involved through a single mother's group  which is where he meets the strange twelve year old boy Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), who lives with his depressed, suicidal mother Fiona (Toni Collette). A tragic event sees Marcus seeking comfort with the indifferent Will who begins to realise that there's more to life than sitting around at home all day.",/review/rw3102187/?ref_=tt_urv

",just finished watching this fine fine movie and am still trying to digest it. well...i must say this coming of age ( Hugh's character too )movie made me feel so content after i finished viewing it. i've forgotten how good Hugh grant is in melodramatic comedies and all in all i think the British are the best at these types of comedies. the movie has a decent rating of 7.1 and i would personally give it a 7.5. this is possibly one of Hugh's best efforts and he seemed to have a lot of fun doing it.,/review/rw3102187/?ref_=tt_urv

4 September 2014,rajatdahiyax,7," An amusing film with a feel good feeling!!!!
","About a Boy is a 2002 comedy-drama film co-written and directed by brothers Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz. It is an adaptation of the 1998 novel of the same name by Nick Hornby. The film stars Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, Toni Collette, and Rachel Weisz. The film at times uses double voice-over narration, when the audience hears both Will's and Marcus's thoughts. Will is a 36-year-old underachiever with a fear of commitment that leads him to seek out relationships with single mothers, on the assumption that they are more desperate. However, plans go awry when he befriends with Marcus, the weird 12-year-old son of his latest target. Soon, Will and Marcus become friends, and as Will teaches Marcus how to be a cool kid, Marcus helps Will finally to grow up.",/review/rw3102187/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2005,kwongers,10," Hugh Grant shines; great coming-of-age movie; bloody hilarious and touching at the same time
","In the wonderfully entertaining ""About A Boy,"" Hugh Grant shucks everything that made him famous nearly a decade earlier in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" (the floppy hair, the stuttering, etc.) and ends up giving his best performance to date. He plays Will, a wealthy, happily unemployed, commitment-phobic cad (slightly less insidious than Daniel Cleaver of ""Bridget Jones's Diary"") whose newest ploy is to date single mothers because they are easier to dump. However, he meets Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), the son of a somewhat suicidal mother (Toni Colette), and realizes that he cannot continue living his life so shallowly.",/review/rw3102187/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2003,TxMike,," ""Santa's Super Sleigh""
","""About a Boy"" is an interesting and entertaining film, deserving of it's median IMDb rating of ""8"". But the whole story depends upon not the boy, nor Hugh Grants's character, but the deceased father we never meet. Had he not been a ""one-hit wonder"", writing the (fictional) super popular ""Santa's Super Sleigh"", allowing Grant's character to live a life off royalties where he ""does nothing"", then there would not have been a story worth filming. Story filmed in and around London.",/review/rw3102187/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2014,marieconstance1,9," One of my all time favorites!
","This is absolutely one of my favorite all time movies, I have it in my DVD collection, and whenever I'm feeling nostalgic and want to see a bit of London, hear witty British accents, then this is the film I watch. Nicholas Hoult is adorable in his role as ""Marcus"", I absolutely adore him, he'll do anything to make his mother happy, he wears the clothes and shoes she makes him wear, eats all the healthy food she makes him eat, sings the songs she likes (""Killing me softly""-has become an all time classic in my house because of this film); Toni Collette plays his crazy, vegan, hippy suicidal mother, when she makes him that loaf of organic brown bread that he kills a duck at the park- is one of our favorite scenes. He meets ""Will"" (Hugh Grant) who is a self-obsessed bachelor; they both become ""friends"" in an intricate and funny way, by Marcus practically barging into Will's life, taking over his home after school. Will, being more ""hip"" and into modern ways, tries to buy new sports shoes for Marcus, after he sees all the bullying and tormenting that Marcus is enduring at school, Marcus ends up going home shoeless in the rain. The entry of Rachel Weisz and her strange son in all of this, is also done in a funny way, and I love R.Weisz in everything she does, she is simply stunning. I love the plot, the London scenes, the whole comical story blends into one that has become a favorite with our family.",/review/rw3102187/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2003,Derek237,10," Do not miss this movie!
","I have watched About A Boy over and over and each time I seem to love it even more. I really think it's the best film from 2002. It's very rare now for a movie to be this funny and at the same time be just as touching, too. You actually care for the characters in this movie and the ending is satisfying. Hugh Grant is great as Will and it is definitely his best performance. Also, About A Boy just wouldn't be the same without the soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy. ",/review/rw3102187/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2008,Chrysanthepop,," About Two Boys
","The Weitz brothers (of 'American Pie' fame) surprised me with this intelligent comedy. They do a commendable job of bringing Nick Hornby's modern British comedy to screen. Peter Hedges takes up the challenge to adapt Hornby's novel and he does a fine job. I liked that it wasn't Americanized. The quirkiness and humour is well balanced, witty and clever while amusing. The film is mainly about growth of the characters especially Will, Fiona and Marcus and I loved how it was portrayed in a gradually subtle way. The situations are easy to relate to. Even though the characters live under unusual circumstances: like Will choosing not to work because he does not need to, the suicidal Fiona or Marcus regularly visiting Will in order to fix him up with his mom, they are easy to identify with. Hugh Grant is great as the shallow Will. He's cast against type and this is perhaps the role that allows him to stretch his acting further. Nicholas Hoult delivers a natural performance. He's certainly not those movie kids who are made to look cute because the director can't get them to act (so credit does go to the Weitzs). Toni Collette is superb as always. Rachel Weisz makes the best of a small role. The rest of the cast do a good enough job. The soundtrack is gentle and whimsical at times, flowing smoothly with the steady pace. I liked the songs of Badly Drawn Boy. Some of the deleted scenes on the DVD are worth a watch. In a nutshell, 'About A Boy' is a simple, delightful and funny movie about growing up.",/review/rw3102187/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2015,Geeky Randy,8," Undeniably entertaining
","This adaptation by Brothers Weitz of the Nick Horny novel of the same name is a very refreshing comedy-drama that successfully uses a double voice-over narration, one of a man who hasn't quite grown up (Grant) and the other of a boy who has to grow up too quickly (Hoult). Toni Collette received several nominations for her supporting role, but the substance of her character is not quite apparent; while Rachel Weisz's subplot comes together and undone a little too easily. If this film were set during 1993–1994 like it was in the book, the overall story would have had more significance. Still, while a little too modern for its own good, ABOUT A BOY is undeniably entertaining (and even, ugh, a little cute) and without a doubt worth remembering.",/review/rw3102187/?ref_=tt_urv
