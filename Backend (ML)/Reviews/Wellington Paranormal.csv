26 September 2022,imseeg,8," Mesmirizing script that kept me glued to the screen till the very last minute. Stellar acting performance by Guy Pearce.
","A fascinating and mesmirizing story about a (one hit) worldfamous writer, living secluded in the desert, who slowly looses his mind, when he gets stalked by anonymous letters, whose content reveals secrets that are only known to him. Is he in danger? And if so, who might be after him?",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,tashwat,7," A compelling watch with a surprise twist. Guy Pearce gives another amazing performance.
","The film tells the story of a one-hit-wonder writer, Bruce Cogburn, who now lives as a recluse in southern California following a mass-shooting incident where the shooter ""blamed"" his motive for the crime on Cogburn's book. Now 25 years on from the incident, Cogburn begins to receive a barrage of letters from an unknown source, leading to the question that carries the film; ""who is sending all these letters?"".",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,kaefab,7," Farfetch yes but does not deserve such a low rating
","Farfetch yes but does not deserve such a low rating, yes it's quite insane everything that is going on in the movie and it does keep you guessing until the end.",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,charlottebetteridge-93481,3," Great concept, great acting, just didn't work
","I don't quite know why this didn't work, but it wasn't gripping, the story was messy and was clunky. The acting was really good and I love the idea, but disappointing sadly. Some interesting twist, so not a complete flop, and whoever wrote it was clearly intellectual, just a bit of a dullard, or maybe that was the director? Had to tell.",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2022,Boristhemoggy,3," Guy Pearce is magnificent, shame about the film.
","I went into this with mixed feelings because Guy Pearce is a most accomplished actor and I love watching him. However, Alice Eve as co star said instantly 'B movie'.",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2022,Maxax777,6," I actually enjoyed it
","I actually enjoyed it - it was better than what I was expecting. The beginning gets to be little drawn out to finally work your way towards the end - but it's not bad. Again, I enjoyed it. Guy Pierce did a great job - and although it was a little slow, I still enjoyed it nonetheless. Now then if I added more to this review, I'd probably have have spoilers - and I don't want to completely dissect the entire film or spoil anyth. But it wasn't terrible - a little bit drawn out - but it was okay overall. This sentence I am writing now will help me to reach the mandatory minimum length of my review! Whew!!!",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv

24 September 2022,fireflicker38,2," Waited for something to happen but went nowhere
","No doubt there was good acting, but the film as a whole was a complete flop. It was very boring...I kept waiting for something to happen. Throughout the entire movie I waited and then just a bit happened in the end which was not at all satisfying.",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2022,fraser-simons,3," Bad writing about writing, unironically
","I was in for an alternate Secret Window, or something like it. This was even more contrived, and somehow snagged Guy Pearce and that guy from Lost who is usually alright. How? No idea. This script is just plain old not good.",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2022,GeorgeWHAMMYBush,5," It just doesn't work
",Guy Pearce should easily win a best actor award for this. He gives it his all.,/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2022,deloudelouvain,5," Too long to keep me interested.
","I watched The Infernal Machine with three other people. They all liked it a bit more than me, but it's not that they loved it. I wasn't impressed by it at all. The movie is just too long for that kind of story. It could easily have been half an hour lesser long. Slow paced, repetitive, just not really my thing. By the time the mystery was solved I lost all interest in the story, almost fell asleep. As for the acting it's basically all about Guy Pearce, whom isn't a bad actor, but even he couldn't make this movie better. I won't say the movie is a complete failure, as it probably will please other people, but just not me.",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,ops-52535,6," this was a heavy and slow...
","Neurological and psychological meal to devour and swallow. But the never ending philosophical moral of this overfeature length mystery thriller drama is that to lie is a deadly sin, to steal is a deadly sin, and to kill is a most mortal sins of all, in a slow churning plot about a desillutionized author and professors desperatly hiding from society and truth, an almost biblical toned armaghedonish fight to overcome the bad concience of bad deeds done in a very dysantrophobical caracter driven, but ever so surprisingly well acted almost solo riding guy pearce who, when allowed to speak british english appears to the audience as a golden star in the pantheonatic silverscreen theater, a guy ive disliked for so many years for bad acting , has risen from the grave of thrown outta the a-league of the actors guild...",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv

",What could have been a good film quickly turns into your usual paranoid writer fare.,/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2022,nogodnomasters,8," Who am I?
","""The Infernal Machine"" was book of the year in 1981 by Bruce Cogburn (Guy Pearce). It later inspired a mass shooting in Knoxville killing 13 people by teen Dwight Tufford (Alex Pettyfer). Tufford blamed Cogburn. Cogburn became a recluse after that, never to write again, hiding away near Almas Perdides, California. He lives his life in whisky and Marlboro regulars. He has been getting persistent letters from William Dukant requesting his opinion. He responds to Dukant's answering machine from a pay phone asking him not to bother him, but to no avail. Things start to get get weirder day by day.",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2022,kanifuker-84708,10," A Masterpiece
",Guy Pearce is one of my very very favourite actors going back to the 80's when he was in the Australian soap Neighbours. Since then he has flourished in a hell of a lot of movies and rightly so. He is on par with some of the great actors around and in the past.,/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,marnold97306,3," Psychological head trauma
","I was intrigued the first fifteen minutes or so. Guy Pearce is an extraordinary actor, but sloppy writing can destroy even the best of performances.",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2022,danieljfarthing,6," A slow-burn thriller with dark & moody set-up... to a bloated, self-satisfied & implausible ending
","A thriller as slow-burn as debut writer / director Andrew Hunt's ""The Infernal Machine"" relies on its ending, which here is self-satisfied, contrived & implausible... wasting some terrific dark & moody set up work. Reclusive writer Guy Pearce (always solid) lives in isolation after his only novel inspired a mass-shooter 40yrs+ ago. Then SOMEONE starts sending him persistent 'fan mail'... but is it more sinister than that (duh)? Is it the jailed shooter Alex Pettyfor? Will Pearce get help from pretty cop Alice Eve (whose performance epitomises the whole movie: surprisingly good, til ultimately it ain't)? Worthy questions all, all sadly let down by that bloated ending. Shame... sigh.",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2022,BandSAboutMovies,5," The Infernal Machine
","Bruce Cogburn (Guy Pearce) is a writer whose book, The Infernal Machine, was a huge success that he's never been able to follow up on. Now, an obsessed fan seeks to draw him out of hiding. However, that fan seems to not have Cogburn's best interests at heart.",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2022,sassy-14613,8," A nice mystery
","I really enjoyed this movie, especially with recent post pandemic offerings. It had me interested and invested in the story. Guy Pearce was really good. There are twists and turns and good amount of imagination to the story. Camera work and cinematography are top tier.",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,CinemaSerf,6," The Infernal Machine
","A lot of this reminded me of ""Unhinged"" (2020) with Guy Pierce here delivering a strong and characterful performance just as Russell Crowe did back then. Again, like that film, the rest of this story is weak and far-fetched, though. Pierce is reclusive British author ""Cogburn"" who finds himself being pursued by researching novelist ""William DuKent"". Initially hostile, for some reason he takes to calling this man from a local phone box and leaving his machine messages telling him to get lost. (Just quite why he doesn't just ignore him... well?). Anyway, this persistence unleashes in the writer the need for a dog and a bottle, and it's after a little too much one night he encounters a local law officer ""Higgins"" (Alice Eve) and the story lurches from a curious and intriguing personality analysis to a pretty ridiculous mystery centring around a mass shooting 25 years earlier in Knoxville for which ""Tufford"" (Alex Pettyfer) was incarcerated for life in a super-max prison. As the story starts to unfold, it becomes clear that strings are being pulled and that ""Cogburn"" is being manipulated. By whom and what for? Well we do find that out, but by the time we do the story has completely lost it's initial potency and become really quite contrived. Pierce does deliver well - he really does, but the squeakily-voiced Pettyfer exudes all the menace of a wet tea bag and the denouement, though quite revealing, is all just a bit poor.",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,vengeance20,6," It's Not Bad, But It's Not Clear
","So, I saw a preview of this & thought it looked good, but reviews & ratings made me think it might not be good. Nonetheless, I still went to see this.",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2022,ethanbresnett,5," Messy
","The Infernal Machine is a real shame as I do think there's a good film to be had in the core idea, but the film just feels like a real mess.",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2022,digitalphotoperson,5," One too many subplots
","This could have been a superb, suspenseful film. I don't want to give a way anything though. The part with the then kid open fire on students in a mass shooting didn't not fit into the main plot whatsoever.",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,itsnoturm,8," Not Pearce's first machine.
","Frankly, if this man called me up and spouted his inebriated internal diatribe at me for hours on end, I'd probably write to him everyday as well. Mr Cogburn, take a bow good sir, for you are a marvel.",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,mn_nin_man,10," Guy is a Quazar of cool!
","Guy Pierce could not be better as this mysterious cowboy writer. Like many films, it begins like an unstaffed puzzle. It comes together piece by piece until it's revealed and complete. It keeps you tense throughout, which is the purpose of a thriller. The rugged dusty visuals add to the tenseness. Alice Eve and Jeremy Davies are also great and to the twists and turns of the movie.",/review/rw8565691/?ref_=tt_urv
