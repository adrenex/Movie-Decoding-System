27 January 2022,AfricanBro,10," God forgives, right?
","If heaven and hell are real I pray I'm forgiven for my fascination with such dark shows. Just by looking at the poster you know this is going to be something unholy. You got Frankenstein, demons, the Christian devil himself, God, vampires like Dracula and Dorian gray, werewolves, witches, and not the pretty kind, all put in a fiendish Victorian setting with a remarkable script and great cast lineup to go with it, how could you not love this show. It's heartbreaking that it only had 3 seasons but after Vanessa Ives character arc was completed it's hard imagining the show going forward despite the assemblage of characters they could have made center of the show. It just wouldn't be the same without her.",/review/rw6433290/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2020,Supermanfan-13,8," Really good Supernatural/Horror show!
",Penny Dreadful is one of the better Supernatural/Horror TV series I've ever seen. While I have to admit that I'm not the biggest supernatural fan this hooked me from the start and kept me coming back for more until the next thing I knew I binged the entire series! Eva Green & Josh Hartnett are the stars here as they lead a pretty stellar cast! I'm glad I finally gave it a chance as should you.,/review/rw6433290/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2014,gogoschka-1,," Strikes the perfect balance between Gothic art-house horror and gory B-movie action; visuals look great
","Well, I'm trying to write a completely spoiler-free review here, but I guess it's safe to announce that 'Penny Dreadful' looks positively gorgeous. Great production design and cinematography: by the time we get to see Victorian London as night descends upon the city and the fog starts creeping through those narrow cobblestone alleys, nearly every frame looks like a beautiful, Gothic painting (and not once did I spot a fake looking CG-background). As far as the actors are concerned, they portray their obscure, troubled characters with a certain kind of ""theatre"" intensity that fits the story and the turn-of-the-century setting very well.",/review/rw6433290/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Very Entertaining!
","Penny Dreadful is one of the better Supernatural/Horror TV series I've ever seen. While I consider myself to be a fan of supernatural shows and movies, I'm not one of those die hards who love any supernatural fan regardless of its good or not. This particular one hooked me from the start and kept me coming back for more until the next thing I knew I binged the entire series! It has so many twists and turns that it will keep you entertained through the series. It's only three seasons long but they are 3 great seasons. All three seasons are equally good. Having three seasons this show never grows stale and goes out while still interesting. Eva Green and Josh Hartnett are the stars here as they lead a stellar cast. I'm glad I finally gave it a chance as should you.",/review/rw6433290/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2018,lenavisekruna,10," A masterpiece of acting
","All hail to Eva Green! What an actress! If for nothing else you should see it for her. And I must say for all the other actors - bravo.
The first season is amazing. I must say that I'm not overly fond of watching horror movies but this was something different. Let's say that not all episodes are horror.
The combination of characters, the writing, the dark atmosphere, everything was brilliant. It is an interesting journey through characters such as Frankenstein, Dorian Grey etc. But I must go back to the acting and once again say it's a masterpiece. I really recommend this one.",/review/rw6433290/?ref_=tt_urv

17 October 2021,Real_Mrs_JonSnow,10," Just beautiful in every way
","Penny Dreadful doesn't get enough credit. It is a perfect show. I'm obsessed with it. I didn't find it until a couple years ago and I have already watched every season twice. I have searched for another show like this but there are none. Especially not the series to follow in the Penny Dreadful family. It is written so poetically, like a book from the same time. The sets are beautiful and capture every detail from the 19th century. Every actor played their parts perfectly, especially Eva Green. It is a dark, gothic story that is profoundly unsettling. I hope the creators can find the same magic again and create a show that is as bewitching as this.",/review/rw6433290/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2022,tchitouniaram,9," That is
","Definitely one of the , unfortunately , very few really well done TV shows !!! Eva Green is absolutely astonishingly brilliant in portrayal of a woman in the different dire situations , as physical and emotional ! All cast is at theirs best . Definitely highly recommended!",/review/rw6433290/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2022,bcnkor,10," The best performance of actress Eva Green's careera Green's career

14 January 2017,SnoopyStyle,7," beautiful somber Gothic
","It is late 19th century London. American gunslinger Ethan Chandler (Josh Hartnett), running from his past, encounters strange creatures in the night. He joins medium Vanessa Ives (Eva Green) and her troubled mentor Sir Malcolm Murray (Timothy Dalton). He is taken with poverty-stricken Brona Croft (Billie Piper) who dies from consumption. Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Harry Treadaway) had revived the dead John Clare (Rory Kinnear) and later Brona renaming her Lily Frankenstein. The immortal Dorian Gray (Reeve Carney) is taken with Lily. The series follows these various characters as they interact with various dark forces. There are witches, werewolves, vampires, and Dr. Henry Jekyll.",/review/rw6433290/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2014,reeseslightning,8," An odd duck, this one.
","The pilot episode was a typical getting-to-know-you episode where it introduces most of the characters and some intriguing aspects. At first, I was like, ""Oh gods above not another vampire show"" - boy, was I wrong. By the end of the second episode, I was totally hooked by Eva Green's performance alone. Just stunning work by her in the s√©ance scene. Totally blew me away. ",/review/rw6433290/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2014,jonnytheshirt,8," Excellent top quality production
","Well I'll try and not reveal much however Penny Dreadful is most certainly one of the best series on our screens at the moment. It is somewhat of a slow burner at times however it absolutely burns with a restrained ferocity very much like it's actors and characters. There's a palpable energy in every performance as there is a lot of meat to each character. Everyone is an anit-hero and personally I find all the performances very engaging. Timothy Dalton radiates a commanding and duplicitous presence that matches Eva Green's which is hard to do. Even more surprising is Josh Harnett and Harry Treadaway keeping toe to toe with them both also. Billy Piper's just warming up too. I'm a veteran Horror fan and rarely have I seen such quality in feature length movies. I just watched the last in the current series and it was emotional, the trick to the P Team is that the monsters are center stage and they are very human. Rory Kinnear induces both horror and extreme pathos that very much surprises. Logan has crafted something special, something very well thought out and acted and executed in every aspect with care. The script is the only one on screen at the moment that reminds me of The Game of Thrones in the fact that every line of dialogue is loaded with meaning, coupled with the Victorian setting means that everyone is hiding something and every word is crafted. Very unusual and highly recommended, nothing is as it seems in Penny Dreadful and the characters are all the more relatable for their failings and apparent monstrousity.",/review/rw6433290/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2021,jewgreen,9," This one is really something.
","I'm only just now watching this. After reading the plot description, I thought it sounded ridiculous and there would be no way to intertwine horror classic characters in one show and have it be anything other than nonsense. Boy, was I wrong. The whole thing is deeply steeped in gothic horror, but they explore many other angles and do some excellent character study. Some really great acting in here, and as mentioned repeatedly, Eva Green is just spectacular.",/review/rw6433290/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2021,kevin_robbins,10," Season 1 & 2 are Epic...Season 3 is a rushed mess
","We finally watched Season 3 of Penny Dreadful off the Showtime App. This storyline focuses on Vanessa Ives finally meeting the man behind her persistent super natural encounters, Dracula himself. The band will need to get back together if she has any chance of ending her suffering. We also discover how Dorian and Lily's relationship ends and Dr. Frankenstein and the Monster continue to try and find themselves. This season was by far the worst one. The delivery of who The Monster was before he became the Monster could have been delivered so much better. I did like how the storyline came full circle. That was the only storyline that at least came full circle but was still a mediocre closing. The final fight sequence and the delivery of every character's conclusion felt rushed and was unfulfilling. I was so disappointed with the final episode. I'd score this season a 6/10, Season 2 a 9/10 and season 1 a 10/10.",/review/rw6433290/?ref_=tt_urv

12 July 2014,MOscarbradley,7," One of the year's more pleasant surprises
","After a slightly shaky start, (I think trying to encapsulate the stories of Frankenstein and his monster, Dracula, Dorian Gray, not to mention a rip-off of ""The Exorcist"", with a werewolf thrown in for good measure, might have been going a creature or two too far), ""Penny Dreadful"" turned out to be one of the year's more pleasant, as well as nastiest, surprises. Unlike the pretentious, art-house gore-fest that is ""Hannibal"" this was imaginative, fast-moving, just the right side of silly when it needed to be and intelligent, (and suitably gruesome), in just the right proportions, adhering very much to the spirit of the originals if not to their text. It was also very well acted by a decent and starry cast, (as a young Victor Frankenstein and his creature both Luke Treadaway and Rory Kinnear were outstanding while even Josh Hartnett acquitted himself quite well this time round), written and directed. For once I'm looking forward to Series Two already.",/review/rw6433290/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2014,face-819-933726,9," Surprising, and exciting, well written, and beautifully produced.
","If you have watched a lot of TV and you have ever asked what it would be like to mix Ripper Street with Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and Supernatural, putting the whole thing on an unrated cable station, then you would possibly have had a show like this in mind. That nonsense aside this is a really well produced, and seems to be quite deeply thought out show that mixes all of the sense of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, the opening act gave me a sensation of an early days origin story for R.I.P.D. some sort of Men in Black for the supernatural types. I Enjoyed this show quite a bit, it really does stand out in it's heavy levels of gore, and violence, and the acting Eva Green alone is just completely Ice on fire, but the rest of the cast are just as fantastic. I recommend this movie to fans of the science fiction mash-ups, as that is exactly what this is, if you like action, and can appreciate truly adult horror the corrupt, and dirty kind, then this is for you. The entire production is cinema quality, if you understand how many levels Banshee is above most TV, you will appreciate this show in a very similar way.",/review/rw6433290/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2015,Damianski23,10," Beware those who lust for visual and audio stimulants...it will capture you entirely
","There are few moments in life when you get to drip and drool your eyes and ears at the same time, while your heart fights your soul reaching to understand and become a lover of evil. Rare are those moments. There may be many that do not share my perspective, nor do they taste my words and vision, but then again, I am sure that some are like me. Hungry to feel, to truly feel life, and thirsty for ambivalence, for the evil to have a good face and vice versa and more importantly to see that even flawed ones have a faith to preach and fulfil.

8 September 2020,sherripadgitt,9," First Season Great...Second Season Shocking
","The first season was told in gothic poetic tones. It had some violent scenes but most of the show was artistically visual and I loved it. The story told was heartbreaking and horrific and very well done. The actors were perfect in their parts. From Ms. Ives, to Dorian Gray, to Dr. Frankenstein, each character played their parts to perfection.
Onto season 2 and I am shocked at what I am seeing. It has surpassed violent and has gone somewhere else beyond. I am not so sure what to think yet, but it is gory and includes some pretty evil witch-craft. Blend that together with the gothic vibes and it makes this show even creepier than the first. More character development with some of the side characters is being brought out which is great. Dr. Frankenstein is still up to his shenanigans.",/review/rw6433290/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2014,pk1873,9," Love horror? watch this!
","I had to add a review of this show after i saw the minority of reviews were so negative, i really can't believe that anyone would rate this series at 1/10 that is a disgrace in itself. the production values would rival most high budget movies and the acting is definitely 2 steps up from anything else horror orientated on TV( with the exception of billie piper who does an irish mish mash of accents while pulling the faces of a bulldog chewing a wasp)this however is a minor complaint, even josh hartnett pulls it out of the bag as far as the rest of the cast go. If you like your classic horror tales or goth horror then this is definitely worth checking out, i grew up watching the mummy,Dracula,the wolfman and frankenstein on late night TV and i have to say this series revisits those nights curled beneath the duvet with the class and atmosphere of the tales from which it draws it's inspiration. well worth a look guys, don't let the downers put you off!!",/review/rw6433290/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2021,the_donnie,8," A spectacular combination of the best of classic horror literature and tales in one TV series
","Witches, vampires, wolfman, Frankenstein, Dorian Grey and other mystical characters meet in the 19th century industrial London in one fantastic series of well developed characters and storyline, together with great performances and stunning visual effects. Seasons 1 & 2 are excellent, 9/10. Season 3 is disappointing (6/10), it got abstract and repetitive with too many plots going on in different places.",/review/rw6433290/?ref_=tt_urv
