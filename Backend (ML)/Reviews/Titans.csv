30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Pretty Entertaining!
","Titans is a gritty show that's based off the comic book ""Teen Titans"" which follows a group of young heroes as they try to make the world a better place to live in. I've really come to enjoy this show a lot. There are some parts that slow the show down a little but the good definitely outweighs the bad. It's obviously a show that's much more aimed at adults so some might be turned off by that but I like it more because of it. It continues to have surprise after surprise that will keep you entertained and wanting more. They give each character plenty of room to grow and expand each of their storylines. You really become invested in each character because of the storytelling here. It's show that keeps you on your toes as it is not afraid to kill off main characters. I'm looking forward to future seasons!",/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Worth Watching!
","Titans was so much better than I thought it would be! After reading the reviews I wasn't really sure what to expect, there are more positive than negative but it's still pretty mixed so I still wasn't sure. I thought I'd finally give it chance and now that I just finished Season 3 I'd have to say I'm glad that I did because it was really good! It's obviously much more aimed at adults so some might be turned off by that but I like it more because of it. Im looking forward to future seasons!",/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2018,cherold,7," Season 1: terrific, season 2: mixed bag, season 3: dreadful
","Original review of season 1 (9 stars):
I notice some IMDB user reviews are horrified by the darkness of the series. This is exactly what I like about it, so if you want a series about heroic vigilantism as a source of empowerment, this is probably not the show for you.",/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2022,D4V1D2411,8," Fun dumb entertainment
","I have just watched this show until the 3rd season. So with that said, I have mixed feelings for this show, on one side I love all this characters and Im just happy to see them adapted in live action, but on the other hand, they are just so different from their OG version that they are practically different characters. The ebst example of this is Robin or later Nightwing, in the comics he is always the optimistic guy, the voice of reason, the guy that always helps people and is always smiling. He is completly different now, he is much more darker. At the beginning he didnt even wanted to help Raven and while its weird its kinda makes sense for the story, he is supposed to become nicer and on later seasons he is, not as nice as in the comics, but he is. The other characters have the same situations, they are darker and just keep a little of their og personalities of the comics, but they progressively get closer to those. The story is fine for the 3 season, but just that, fine. There are really good episodes sometimes and other times you just want to fall sleep, it also doesnt help that the cast is way too big; in the second season, its massive and we often have to ignore some plots in order to progress others, but losing a lot of time in othe rinteresting things; anothe problem is how often they try to introduce new characters and then forget about them, there are episodes in which Beast Boy or Super boy do nothing. Its way too crowded here, they should really get a smaller cast in order to flesh each one of them more. Another problem is that the show is sometimes trying to be edgy just for the sake of being edgy, not all episoes need to have blood, and while I normally like dark edgy stories, this is too much. And my final problem with the story is how some problems are just resolved in 1 episode. For example, in the first episode of the second season, they just get rid of Trigon in a couple of minutes; Trigon was supposed to be this evil bad guy that was unstoppable and they tried the entire first season to stop him from returning but then it seems so easy just to stop him. And this trend continues all the seasons, there are too many storylines, most of them end poorly, most characters get to do nothing and each episode were just jumping from new introduced character to new introduced character. With that said, I still enjoyed the show; as I said in the beginning I just really like the characters and despite their changes, I still love them and I just like to see them in action.",/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,UniqueParticle,9," Starts off epic not sure about later seasons but I'm sure it's better than Arrow or even the The Flash has terrible acting
",Absolutely love the music and how exciting the series is especially the grittiness! I'll probably end up appreciating Titans more than some it seems very enjoyable with very likable characters. If I had known the series was based off Teen Titans among a bunch of other DC characters I would've watched sooner. The cinematography and violence is amazing makes everything worth while!,/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2020,rapettif,6," Season 1 showed promise. Season 2 destoyed that promise.
","Season 2 is bad. Just tons of internal conflicts, and several characters acting like psychopaths, idiots or some combination of that. In almost all of the season nothing happens at all. Some quite horrible choices made in this season.
What a waste!!",/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv

",This show is everything I want from a DC live action series. It is fun and awsome and scary in the best way. If you like DC you will love this show . They are bringing awsome DC charater to the show.,/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2021,MovieFreak35,8," watched 3 seasons at the time of this review
","I really like this show, it has the dark and gritty feel to it which i prefer in my comic book movies and tv. The characters are all well developed and the story, even tho different every season wraps up nicely in the end leaving no question or plotholes left untold.",/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2018,nothimme,7," Not what I expected
","It wasn't as edgy as I thought it would be. Actings wasn't as weird as I thought it would be. The choreography wasn't as fake as I thought it would be. CGI didn't look as bad as I thought it would be. Production didn't look as cheap as I thought it would be. Editing wasn't as sloppy as I thought it would be. Dialogues weren't as cheesy as I thought it would be. Interactions are promising. Narrating is captivating. The build-up is looking good. Developments are on point. The episodes actually make sense. The show isn't overly edgy. It has a gritty and realistic take on and it works. I really didn't expect this. I hope they won't spoil this in the future, and raise their bar, it has really good potential. Just don't be fooled by the trailers like i was.",/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2022,jmjones-34107,10," Finally
",Idk about every1 else but I love DC over Marvel. I was hugely surprised by Titans but Raven alone in this show could produce her own spinoff with the insane powers she possesses. Of course things could be better like Starfire actually flying but Robin's transition into Nightwing and Jason Todd's Red Hood brilliant. Now I'm reading HBOMax has some new dumbass ceo thats going to cancel pretty much everything that brought most of us to the platform to begin with. I've been waiting forever for the next season.,/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2019,sstidham-4,1," Appeals To The Lowest Common Denominator
","Have you ever wanted to see bad fan fiction, written by a 13yo, given the live treatment? This is the show for you.
Now fans of Teen Titans Go! or of the equally popular award winning 80's run of The New Teen Titans; will not recognize these characters. There's almost no budget, so Starfire looks nothing like Starfire, same for Beast Boy. In this universe dropping f bombs is the only way to complete sentences. It's a very dark show based with relationships so fractured, you're left wondering how these people ever came together to begin with.
It's baffling that Geoff Johns is involved. Not only from a writing standpoint, but from a destroying the incredible world Wolfman and Perez created. If he thought he was improving on these heroes, he's sadly mistaken. The writers don't respect the characters they're using here. So many of Dick Grayson's actions goes against the core of who he is. The Titans are a family, they care for one another and build each other up. At least that's how they should be written.
This seems to be a continuation of the Snyderverse of ultra violent live action DC projects with no enjoyable plot lines, miscast actors and leaving you hopeless.",/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2019,gostuffawesome,1," I'm I Missing Something Here?
",It's just easter eggs and one repeated character arc for Dick Grayson. I just can't understand why people praise this show so much the characters have no character.,/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2018,Athanatos173,8," Has It's Problems But Overall It's Pretty Good
","The main weakness this show has is the writing. Though overall it's acceptable, there is a major lull in a few episodes of the first season where they are trying to introduce characters with upcoming series of their own. I think this is the first time I've seen this done in a shows first season, and it doesn't work.",/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv

but I'm not feeling season 3, I find myself constantly wondering
""Who writes this nonsense...""",/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2021,asterblasterth,4," How do they keep doing it?
",How do these writers of DC series keep screwing things up after a good first season? I liked the first season. Got me interested. Then the second was barely okay but the third is just so irritating. Everything is going downhill once again. They did it with Green Arrow and Flash too. They get you excited and then they fumble the ball badly.,/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2019,DangerousDag,2," A self-indulgent exercise in pure nihilism
","Dark and edgy for the sake of dark and edgy might have worked ten years ago, before a hundred other shows did the same, and did it better than this incoherent mess. The atmosphere is the only notable feature of the show, and its so oppressive that it weighs everything down. Storylines that might have been interesting are instead left flat and meaningless by the writers' constant need to divert attention back to the darkness and edginess. Characters who might actually be on the verge of developing into interesting people are instead forced to constantly revert back to brooding, emotionally stunted, self-involved narcissists. The writers' efforts to explore moral ambiguity and shades of gray are consistently frustrated by their own inability to see past the show's unnecessary grittiness long enough to generate anything of substance. Instead, they and their audience are left running around in circles in the unrelenting darkness that is Titans' only real character.",/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2020,MadamWarden,8," Better than expected

26 July 2020,mr_perryhudson,8," I'll Give it an 8.5 because it has so much potential but that Season 2 finale man..
","Titants Started out very Solid in it's first season, they were taking their time introducing and developing characters and Then they decided to rush everything halfway through season two?.... They introduce Deathstroke played by the brilliant Esai Morales which is honestly, enough storyline for a 13 episode miniseries but for some reason they also decide to send Starfire on her own sidequest? And by the end of the season this Fearless, terrifying villain is deafeated in 5 minutes?? AND THEN, out of nowhere Wondergirl can be killed with electricity? What the hell was that??? This show has SO MUCH POTENTIAL but they're rushing everything and that's their mistake.",/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv

1 October 2021,andre_carreiro,7," Season 3 - Good, but bad
","This is a show that if not called ""Titans"" would be a nice show. Nice Special FX, nice characters, decent plot, good shooting (pun intended), lots of good props. They could have called it ""Young Generation"" (not ""Next"", it's ""Taken""). This way they're just pretending to be the Titans, most of the time.",/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,romanticinsomniac,7," Interesting show, but betrays the source material.
","Although it's obvious the production values are high, the mediocre writing, blackwashed characters, and out of character personalities are nothing but frustrating to anyone who loves the source material. This could have been outstanding, but they really screwed this the hell up. Some costumes, like that of Hawk, Dove, Robin, and Nightwing, are excellent, but the costume of Starfire looks like a low rent hooker, while Raven is absolutely atrocious, and Beast Boy is just downright lazy. I'm not even going to comment on the disappointment that is Trigon. It's as if somebody wanted to make a Titans show, but never read more than one comic book. There's a lot of excellent storylines the show runners can pull from. Let's hope this show gets better, and not worse. As of now, this show is like a CW show with more money. That's not a compliment. There's no excuse for DC Comics to not have the very best comic book based entertainment. Let's hope the future is bright, because people like myself, who have been buying comic books, and merchandise from DC all of our lives deserve better.",/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2022,shlokamt,8," Dark and worth it. Definitely worth a watch.
","It is an amazing show. It might not match with the comics a lot but if you watch it as an original, it is totally worth it. A re imagination of the sidekicks of the best dc heroes and how they end up together. Their battles, their mistakes, their mysteries and their victories are shown with excellence. It is a little dark and adult series and the actors are also pretty good. It should have had more episodes in each season which would have made it a lot more enjoyable and catchy but it still is absolutely worth it. I especially enjoyed the character of Dick Grayson and his journey from Robin to Nightwing.",/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,asdffan,7," This show has potential
","I feel like I'm in the minority when I say I relatively enjoy this show but it has some big problems. For one, the writing, this show needs to work on it's writing, there are so many moments that want to be impactful that just land flat because we aren't invested in the characters. And while I do like the characters sometimes they don't explore their stories in the right way. There are also many parts of the story that just feel rushed and sloppy, particularly the ending of season 2 which is probably one of the biggest let downs. The show also struggles with an identity crisis in terms of it's story lines. The plots revolving around Trigon, Brother Blood and Madam Mayhem feel very convoluted and messy. It feels like the titans are fighting so many over powered beings way too early and it should have time to plant itself. Meanwhile I felt a lot more interested in the street level type action involving characters like Red Hood and Deathstroke. I feels they're like the type of villains they should be fighting at this point in the story. I don't take issue with the tone of the series, I'm into the more down to earth gritty tone, if only the villains matched it. The fight choreography in season 3 is really quite good but the CGI in the later seasons is pretty rough. I think the show has potential but I is limited by it's writers.",/review/rw8718292/?ref_=tt_urv
