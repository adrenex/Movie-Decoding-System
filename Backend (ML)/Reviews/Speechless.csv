8 August 2022,mcnab-54953,9," One of the Better Ones
",Watched this with my wife and it is a very good film. The leads do a fine job and the kids are actually good actors. Not sappy. The previous reviewer was upset that a birth mother would desert her daughter and only watched two minutes of the film. She is not her birth mother and states that right at the beginning. I suggest they try watching again and will find the film very rewarding.,/review/rw8618842/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2022,MichaelByTheSea,10," Emmanuelle Vaugier shines as a divorcee trying to find love while honoring the strong bond with her ""ex"" stepdaughter
","I watched this movie because I loved the lead actress Emmanuelle Vaugier in Hallmark's wonderful Love in Paradise movie with the recently departed Luke Perry. She's quite beautiful but she's also great at playing a strong female character. And, as another reviewer noted, she knows how to ride a horse (and get dirty on a ranch). In fact, she's been riding since 2010 and once placed third in a Burbank horse show competition. I was surprised, and pleased, not to see the NYC city girl ""fish out of water"" trope overplayed. And yet Tara did need some help from time to time, which helped fuel her attraction to Boone (played by the dependable Hallmark vet Kavan Smith).",/review/rw8618842/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,actorkaty,7," The first reviewer erred
","The reviewer above is incorrect. Perhaps if they'd listened carefully, and/or waited longer than 2 minutes before reviewing, the viewer would have discovered that the child in question is not the biological daughter of the main character; she's from his previous marriage.",/review/rw8618842/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2022,nptomey,7," Rewarding movie
",I truly enjoyed this movie. It moved fluidly and the stars did a fine job bringing the movie to life. This is one of Hallmark's best movies. My only comment was with Kavan Smith's horseback ride. Cowboys don't post in the saddle. Emmanuelle Vaugier really knows how to ride. It was a treat to have female stars that didn't squeal like teenage girls the way they do in so many Hallmark Movies. It was a pleasure to watch this movie and have mature actors. The children in the movie were also quite good.,/review/rw8618842/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2022,jpk-84641,7," A Good One!
","A solid, realistic story with great acting, and believable chemistry between the leads. Predictable ending but an enjoyable watch! Wish Hallmark didn't add in the awkward dance scene. These seem to be written into every Hallmark movie and this one, like most of those in other Hallmark movies, includes dancing that seems out of step with the background music and just uncomfortable to watch.",/review/rw8618842/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2022,cgvsluis,6," Widower with two kids and a divorcée with a step daughter develop a romance.
","I have mixed feelings about this film...but I want to start by saying I loved the lead actors and their supporting cast...I also loved the setting (fake Montana) and I appreciated that they had the big city New Yorker be a great horse rider who dresses appropriately and isn't afraid of animals or hard work (aka fits in), instead of going the fish out of water trope. My difficulties lie in the story content itself...",/review/rw8618842/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2022,excuria,8," Well done except
","It wouldn't have been a movie but I kept wondering why, when she came into her step-daughter's life at least 10-12 years ago, she hadn't adopted her. But then I guess most of the drama would have to be explained in another way.",/review/rw8618842/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,ask-1967,8," A messy, real storyline
","I watch Hallmark movies as a pleasant escape from the realities of 21st century life. However, this movie drew me into the reality of fractured relationships and messy divorces. Anyone, and that's a lot of us, who has gone through toxic breakups where children are involved can relate to this story. I really enjoyed the performances by. Emmanuelle Vaugier, Kavan Smith, and Cassidy Nugent as the daughter caught in the middle of a very difficult situation. I also enjoyed the direction by Peter Benson who inserted himself into the story as the clueless ex more interested with his next marriage rather than his daughter. This is a role he has played in other Hallmark movies, especially as the ex-fiancé Ben Morgan in Love and Sunshine. Throughout this movie I was rooting for Vaugier and Smith to finally realize their feelings for each other. I thought all of the actors were very good and the settings, although not really Montana, were stunning. I did not realize that this movie is based on a best-selling novel, I might have to dust off the old reading glasses and give it a go. All in all, I think this movie has quickly become one of my Hallmark favorites.",/review/rw8618842/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2022,donmccandless-86320,6," A bit more chemistry between the leads would've added two stars
","I've read several of Linda Lael Miller's books and had high hopes for this one. If Vaugier had been able to show the same depth of emotion in her scenes with Smith as she did with her step-daughter, or the two sons of Smith's character, I'd have added a couple more stars.",/review/rw8618842/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2022,drbreakwell,4," Another predictable Hallmark
","First, she wants to go away to get over her XThe male lead is supposed to be a sheriff, but he doesn't seem to work at his job. The female lead doesn't want to get involved, but goes riding, goes to the local dance. Dances a dance, gas fun then shoos him away. Her X calls and asks her to take in his daughter. Seems like her X wants nothing to do with his daughter. She then gets really close to the neighbour and kisses him, forget the pause in her life--she strings him along. Then the X says he is getting married. He is really cold towards the daughter. The script is all over the place. Boring, boring. Predictable girl and boy have a fight. Daughter runs away. Brings boy and girl back together. Same old, same old. But that said, the ending was the most exciting part.",/review/rw8618842/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2022,ladymustang-12160,7," A little different for Hallmark
","The story was a bit different than your usual Hallmark fare. A bit darker with the stepdaughter and such. I really enjoyed this one for the most part. Good story, likeable leads, good child actors. Loved the raccoon known to everyone in town. Really liked that they avoided the typical city girl dresses inappropriately, can't do anything for herself, knows nothing about the outdoors stuff. That was nice. I have two ""gripes"" about the movie - both probably really superficial. One is that the main male lead is supposed to be the town sheriff but apparently it's a real part-time job?? Because we only see him in uniform twice, I think. For most of the movie, he's just hanging out at home. My other gripe is one that detracted from my enjoyment of the movie, and it's a post-production thing rather than anything wrong with the actors or the story. But it absolutely drove me crazy - the sound effects for walking. Good grief! It didn't matter if the character was male or female, adult or child, wearing boots, heels, slippers, or walking on a wood floor, grass, carpet or dirt. Every step was the same volume and heaviness. And inappropriately loud. It got to the point that all I could hear were those darn footsteps!! Don't know what happened, but it bugged me horrendously. Other than that, it was a good movie, and I especially loved the dynamic between the stepmom and stepkid and how she stood up for her daughter with her ex-husband. Nice to see.",/review/rw8618842/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2022,richterkaren,10," Love country movies
","I loved this movie! Best one I've seen in a while. Emmanuelle is one of my favorites, she is so natural and down to earth. I hope they make a sequel, please!! I loved her in that movie with Luke Perry, love in paradise. Too bad he is no longer with us. Hope to see more of her! Would like to see less of Taylor Cole! I thought everyone did a great job in this movie. Kavan Smith also did a good job. A movie like this relaxes you with the beautiful scenery and the horses. It's a beautiful rural hometown movie and gives her a second chance at love. It's great that it focuses on family and love and not money and luxury.",/review/rw8618842/?ref_=tt_urv
