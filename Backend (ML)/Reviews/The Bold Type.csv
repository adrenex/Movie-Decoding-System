27 April 2001,craigbenting,6," A Better Book Representation, but a Worse Movie
","The problem with adapting books to the movie screen, especially huge epics like Dune, is that a certain interpretation of the original is necessary. Making a 2-3 hour movie out of this novel simply requires a lot of interpretation along with picking and choosing of the source material.  So, I know a lot of people who read the book Dune and really hated the movie adaptation for all the same predictable reasons -- ""Why did they change that?"", ""How could they leave that part out?"", and ""Where did they come up with that?"".",/review/rw0531735/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2000,L. Lion,6," spare, slow moving, engrossing adaptation
","I consider Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" to be the greatest science fiction novel of all time.  Others would disagree, but they would have to admit that it is up there, even if it isn't their #1.  I'm not talking about the whole book series, I'm just talking about the original novel.  So I'm a serious fan of the material.",/review/rw0531735/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2019,pianotm-58404,7," So far this is the...most thorough film version of Dune
","Jon Harrison's version of Dune isn't exactly what you'd expect from a SciFi TV Miniseries...but it's a SciFi TV Miniseries. Much like British Masterpiece Theater, you'd swear they got actors out of college trying to fill a work quota. The acting is Shakespeare in the Park levels of bland with all the pageantry of a repertory theater. William Hurt doesn't help considering his acting has always been bland. He even looks bored in the Marvel movies. There clearly isn't a single frame of this filmed outside, and every single desert scene looks green-screened. The costume design literally makes this look like a college project.
No effort is made to produce makeup effects. On the plus side, they used actual contact lenses instead of roto-scoping for the Melange infused eyes.
It wasn't the best way to do it since the camera has trouble seeing it in bright light, but it's a far superior way to do it than the other version of Dune did.
So, points for that decision! That is a SciFi/SyFy TV mini-series, which means we can forgive most this. It's not as bad as most SciFi/SyFy TV productions. I've seen worse acting worst productions, so let's get into why I rated this at 7 out of 10 instead of 3 (which the acting absolutely deserves).",/review/rw0531735/?ref_=tt_urv

12 June 2001,cajunboy,," It was great to see a six hour treatment but...
","I know that everyone has problems with David Lynch's 1984 version of Dune, but after seeing the television version that adds some scenes, it's grown on me.  I never understood why until I saw the new SciFi Channel miniseries. It was the acting.  They had little to work with, but they were fascinating. The new miniseries gives the book a much more proper story treatment, but the acting falls short.  My best example is the Paul-Feyd contrast. Although, Kyle McLachlan seemed too old to me, he and Sting made excellent opposites in the Lynch version.  The two actors cast in the miniseries looked so much alike and were both so wooden to me that it took me half the movie to be able to easily tell when Feyd appeared.  As has been mentioned in other comments, the rest of the cast is good, but the 1984 version just had such a great cast that the acting is tough to beat. ",/review/rw0531735/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2001,nz man,," Superb. Even my non-sci-fi wife was captivated.
","The comments immediately below from Germany sum up how you will find this film. All I can add is that last night while my wife was sleeping when I put this film in the VCR, she woke up and enjoyed watching this film. This surprised me since she is not into sci-fi films. We found the acting, script, sets and costumes were excellent, and this comes from a couple in their early 50's who can be quite critical of films. See it and enjoy - just keep in mind it is not the usual thin Hollywood story but is from one of the great writers of last century.",/review/rw0531735/?ref_=tt_urv

","I admitt, for me it is the bbest adaptation of the novels. Without the baroc air, proposing beautiful performances, wise options in technical level, preserving, in faithful manner, the soul of series of Frank Herbert, it is more than impressive but correct in profound sense. Sure, first for actors, second , for the desire to be the fair, honest answer to the viewers expectations.",/review/rw0531735/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2011,JoeB131,9," A full adaptation
","This was Sci-Fi's attempt to do the Dune Saga in a way the 1984 movie couldn't, which is a more complete version that was faithful to the original book. I think they did this one very well and the casting was pretty good. It did a few things that the book didn't. For instance, Irulan, who is just a narrator in the book, actually has a pretty active role as a character.",/review/rw0531735/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is an attempt to fit a saga such as Frank Herbert's into $20M and this sad fact is apparent in every CGI sequence, in every landscape, in every interior and costume. The book is such a great material for a superb movie.  Unfortunately, Dune 2000 is anything but that.",/review/rw0531735/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2013,Vincentiu,," correct
","to adapt Dune is a strange work. because the result can be only suggestion of novel atmosphere. so, if the David Lynch version was perfect for the before read the book, this series is perfect for after. it is beautiful, and this is basic virtue. it is fresh and realistic and poetic and fascinating. a large puzzle with a remarkable cast. but, in a sense, it becomes more than a brilliant/nice/convincing adaptation. it is a closed universe , a large painting in which director, scriptwriter, cast impose options, vision and honey.amber of ambition. it is a symphony and this is not a real mistake but only a form of escape from novel circle. a beautiful film. a correct adaptation. but something remains in promise skin.",/review/rw0531735/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2004,nashjar,8," Close, but not perfect
","I've seen and own both this version and the original movie version. I have to say there are things I like better about each movie. The mini-series version has much more time in which to tell this very complicated story. However, the writers seem to have felt the need to invent story lines that do not exist in the Frank Herbert books (i.e. Irulan's affair with Feyd). I did enjoy that Irulan had more of a presence in this movie, and I prefer the overall look of this film (the ruddiness reminding more of an arid desert than the cold greyishness of the original movie). I much prefer the miniseries interpretation of what the 'Weirding Way' is, showing it as a technique rather than a device. However, I miss the 'though-overs' from the original movie, and I thought Sting played a much better Feyd. A true Dune fan will need to see both movies...",/review/rw0531735/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is one of my favorite mini-series. When the Dune movie came out, it was absolutely cringe-worthy. (What the heck is a ""weirding module""? And as for the glitz and cornball dialogue, that was right out of the Flash Gordon family of guaranteed cinematic bombs - and that film bombed spectacularly.)",/review/rw0531735/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2009,FiendishDramaturgy,7," If you're Dune fan, watch it. If not, you might do better to read the book.
","The thing about a TV Mini-Series in comparison to a theatrical event, is that the mini-series has adequate time to tell a story, but often lacks in financial backing to tell it WELL. While this attempt does not utterly fail in the area of effects and eye candy, it does manage to redeem itself when telling the actual story. The effects are far below the 1984 theatrical version, but the story told is superior, if still falling a bit from the tree.",/review/rw0531735/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Dune miniseries opens with a ""flashforward"" montage of action sequences. The realisation quickly dawns that these are the *best* scenes out of the 265 minute running time, and they're not good.  Not good at all.  Oh dear. ",/review/rw0531735/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2007,ozthegreatat42330,6," Doesn't stand up to the original.
","While this version expands the story, which was OK in itself, the charisma of the performances just was not there. I enjoy William Hurt as a rule, but in this case his performance as Duke Leto ""hurt"". Alec Newman's Paul was overly whiny. Saska Reeves was too young as Jessica and then did not even play the role in the sequel, causing a jarring break in consistency. Admittedly some of the costumes were more entertaining in this version, but the still suits of the Fremen were totally unbelievable. One could not conceive of anyone lasting very long in them sitting by a lake much less in the middle of the desert. In the long run the original 1984 theatrical version is the better bet. Plus it had the blessing of the author as well.",/review/rw0531735/?ref_=tt_urv

","I first read Dune by Frank Herbert when I was 14 years old and considered it the best book sci-fi or otherwise I'd ever read, 40 years later and after many re-reads it's still in my top 5. I've never really bothered about a feature film of it when after all the best film of any book you read is usually in your head, and the dire 1984 attempt didn't help me either.

7 December 2000,kel_har,10," Impressive epic miniseries that redefines science fiction
","If there was one word to describe this version of ""Dune,"" I would have to say extraordinary.  John Harrison has done a fantastic job at writing and directing this fantastic miniseries.  Graham Revell's score, dazzling visual effects, flawless cinematography, well-developed story, and the cast all essentially contributed to masterful epic storytelling.  However, ""Frank Herbert's 'Dune'"" does suffer from the stiff performance of William Hurt as Duke Leto Atreides.  On the other hand, the performances by Ian McNeice and Alec Newman makes this entertaining.  Overall, ""Frank Herbert's 'Dune'"" is impressive, spellbinding, and exciting.  It's a must see for any science fiction fan or anyone who loves a great story!!",/review/rw0531735/?ref_=tt_urv

","I despise David Lynch's Dune. In my not so very humble opinion, it is the worst film I have ever seen.

But we are talking about the beginning of the new millennium, so I give the production kudos for a rendering that is vastly superior to the Lynch film and went on to produce the equally excellent Children of Dune sequels.",/review/rw0531735/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2000,drrotwang,," Behold, for it is done.
","Suffer no longer the rumors of a 6-hour-long cut of Lynch's (Smithee's?) 1984, er, attempt.  No more need for such drivel.  Mind you, I was at first willing to dislike this project -- having seen some production stills, and not knowing what to make of it.  Ah, folly of youth!  A few hours on the couch with a preview copy have changed my mind.  This is the good stuff, folks -- the reason we keep our TVs.  The performances range from good to excellent; the cinematography is clean and in some cases downright exciting. Just about the whole book is here, a few judicious cuts notwithstanding, and Dr. Kynes looks like Marty Feldman, but that's OK, I don't mind. Stilgar spits on the floor, Princess Irulan wears some weird headgear and the ships, at last, do not look like the fender of a '57 Chevy.  A well-crafted, lushly-visualized and breathtakingly-realized project.  Not without its faults, though those are very few.  If not merely satisfying, then outright amazing.  Disappointment is unlikely.  Good, good stuff.  -- Rotwang!",/review/rw0531735/?ref_=tt_urv
