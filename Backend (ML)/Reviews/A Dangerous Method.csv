28 February 2007,Galina_movie_fan,10," I like it better than Martin Scorscese's remake:
","After I enjoyed Martin Scorcese's ""The Departed, I decided to watch the film that inspired the celebrated director to re-make it and move the action from Hong Kong to Boston, MA, USA. I must say that I liked the original movie better: 50 minutes shorter than Scorcese's magnificent remake, ""Infernal Affairs"" is tighter, faster, more compelling and tells the same story better. It does not have a grand acting Jack Nicholson who basically plays Daryl Van Horne with the attitude and ""Infernal Affairs"" characters don't talk and don't curse as much as they do in ""The Departed"" but the Hong Kong's movie only benefits from it. As much as I admire Leonardo DiCaprio as Bill Castigan, Tony Leung (Yan) in his role is simply unforgettable.",/review/rw1900945/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2005,OttoVonB,10," Hong Kong does ""Michael Mann""!
","Most western viewers will only know the Asian crime scene from the bleak and lyrical canvas of Takeshi Kitano's work. Here we get something that at first seems far more westernized and very close to the work of one Michael Mann. Okay, enough allusions: yes ""Heat"" comes heavily to mind at first. but this is no simple ""Heat"" in Hong Kong. This a splicing of everything Asians do best in a moody, stylish tension-based thriller. From the beautiful cinematography(reminiscent of Wong Kar-Way's films)- step forward visual consultant Christopher Doyle! - and music to the graceful ying-yang undertones (mirror-images are a key theme), the film's most heroic achievement lies in its leads and in the bold ending.",/review/rw1900945/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2006,paul2001sw-1,9," A textbook thriller
","A deceptively simple idea lies at the heart of this complex thriller: the Hong Kong police and a triad gang both have an informer in each other's organisation: whoever's man picks the enemies' spy first wins the game for his side. Add to that the customary double-agent-doesn't-know-which-side-he-is-on-anymore subplot (doubled, of course), and you have plenty of ingredients for a plot, although it's to the movie's credit that although a little stylised, it never seems false or contrived. Fast-paced and bold, with a generous score, it never insults the viewer's intelligence either, and features just the right level of moral ambiguity. At one level, it's just another thriller, and there's little in the way of wider political or social subtext; but on the other hand, it's a textbook lesson in the art of making this sort of film.",/review/rw1900945/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2007,ackstasis,8," ""If you see someone doing something but at the same time watching you... then he is a cop.""
","Martin Scorsese's 'The Departed' was probably one of the most critically-acclaimed films of 2006, and, upon hearing the tumult of praise that accompanied its release, it was a film that I desperately wanted to see. However, I couldn't do so until I had seen the 2002 Hong Kong film upon which it was based, 'Mou gaan dou {Infernal Affairs},' directed by Wai-keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak. Fortunately, not too long ago, my local movie rental store was having a sale on their superfluous VHS tapes, at a price of $2.00 apiece. Among the cheap movies that I snapped up was a copy of 'Infernal Affairs' that looked like it had never been opened. Having now watched it, I must say that, despite my limited experience with Asian cinema, I very much enjoyed the film. 'Infernal Affairs' combines an irresistible story of intrigue, loyalty and betrayal with some extremely slick editing and camera-work; it's no surprise that the film has acquired an impressive following in the West.",/review/rw1900945/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2005,sobeit712,10," It has changed my expectation on crime drama forever
","This movie has been regarded as the cream of Hong Kong gangster and cop movie. And has won 22 awards. But we all know awards don't mean a thing sometimes. The God Father of America cinema ""Martin Scorsese"" himself is making a American version of the movie, titled: Departed. I'm somewhat happy to see that this movie is being recognized and acknowledged by a true master, but distraught to the possibility of disappointment.",/review/rw1900945/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2004,noralee,," Thrilling Chase of Cop Vs. Cop
","I'm late in discovering the Hong Kong crime thriller genre so I can only compare ""Infernal Affairs (Mou gaan dou))"" to its Hollywood compatriots. It grippingly is the equal of such intense examinations of the anguish of undercover cops as ""Donnie Brascoe"" or dirty cops such as ""Narc"" or ""Training Day."" ",/review/rw1900945/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2003,VoodooVince,9," Absolutely awesome
","A seriously refreshing police thriller that cranks up the tension to the max. There's no overblown gunplay or buddy cop crap here, this baby is tight as a drum and will have your nails down to the quick. Superb performances, a tight script and tense direction make this a winner in every department. Pick it up if you can, it's fantastic.",/review/rw1900945/?ref_=tt_urv

","Thought Chinese thrillers were all about style and blood, as seen in John Woo and Ringo Lam's work (it's basically thanks to them we got Tarantino)? Watch Infernal Affairs, and think again. It's a smart, expertly made film, which succeeds in telling a good story without relying on slo-mo shots or hyperbolic shootouts.",/review/rw1900945/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2003,elu5iv3,9," One of the better cop movies
","A brilliant cop movie out of Hong Kong, with a sublime plot and great acting by the two leads Andy Lau and Tony Leung (an indescribably great actor). An amazing concept with Lau as an undercover Triad member in the police force and Leung as an undercover cop in the Triad... which leads to many interesting situations. Great stuff, and the DVD even has the alternative ending (which isn't nearly as good as the main one).",/review/rw1900945/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2017,planktonrules,9," An excellent game of cat and mouse...but who's the cat and who is the mouse?!
","This film begins with two men in the police academy. Yan (Tony Leung) is drummed out for some rules violation--though he is actually going deep undercover to join the mob and infiltrate it for the police. Lau (Andy Lau) is the opposite--a seemingly exemplary cop who's been planted in the academy by the mob! Soon the mob plant is an important inspector working for Internal Affairs and sending his mob boss all the police moves against the organization and the only one who seems to have a prayer in finding him is Yan...and both are looking to unmask each other. But who will find out the identity of the other first? Plus, Yan's job soon becomes a lot more difficult when his one and only police contact, Superintendent Wong, is murdered! Now no one in the police force knows who he is or can offer him any help...and everyone thinks Lau is beyond reproach and the full power of the Force is behind him...as well as the mob.",/review/rw1900945/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2005,magsy,10," more than just entertaining
","This movie is well-made, stylish and extremely entertaining. However, as stated by the review from a Hong Kong viewer, there is also depth and subtlety rarely found in action/thrillers. It is this depth that makes this movie brilliant. The depth of this movie is best served by the understated yet deeply moving performances of the main characters. Viewers are allowed into the inner changes of these characters and before long, the viewers begin to care about them, be it the ""good guy"" (Yan) or the ""bad guy"" (Ming). The rest of cast successfully relate the complicated and exciting plot to the viewers, and all the supporting performances are almost flawless, perhaps with the exception of the female psychologist who seems sadly one-dimensional. I grew up in Hong Kong but has since lived most of my life in Canada. With this duo-cultural background, I have mixed feelings about the Hollywood remaking of this movie. On the one hand, I am happy for the Hollywood recognition of this great movie by remaking it. On the other hand, I would hate to see how badly sabotaged the end result would be. Some things just do not translate. As a minimum, I hope the great director Scorcese will make good use of the major plot line and generate a haute thriller and with the excellent cast, develop some in-depth characterization. The Chinese philosophy and the spirit of the original film is better left undisturbed.",/review/rw1900945/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2004,Billy Edwards,10," The Cream of Hong Kong Cinema.
","One's an undercover cop inside a Triad, the other is a undercover Triad inside the police force.  Which one will expose the other first?  Riveting drama throughout. Included in the package is a top-notch cast at the peak of their powers and expert direction.  Did I mention this is also an allegory for a Buddhist hell?  (If you don't know what hell is, just take a look at the surviving character at the end of the movie and you'll have a fairly good concept) Just when you think a genre has been done to death, something like this takes you by surprise.  This is a must see film for anyone interested in delving much deeper than standard cop versus crook fair.",/review/rw1900945/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2017,Vartiainen,7," Thrilling chase between the triads and the police
","In this film, which would later be remade in the West as The Departed, two young men are forced to play a deadly game of cat and mouse with their identities and even very lives on stake. Because it turns out that one of them is an undercover cop infiltrating the triads, while the other is a mole in the police force reporting directly to a powerful crime boss.",/review/rw1900945/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2007,badtothebono,9," having seen The Departed first
","I'd say the most amazing thing about INfernal Affairs is that it shows that Hollywood's greatest accomplishment is not its ability to make truly terrible movies. No, Hollywood's greatest accomplishment is its ability to take a great movie and remake it into something infernally inferior. If you haven't seen either of these films, ignore The Departed and watch Infernal Affairs. After you watch Infernal Affairs, continue to ignore The Departed. In IA, the story is tighter, there are no wasted or superfluous scenes seemingly thrown in to give the top-billed some extra face-time, the romantic appendage is simpler and actually logical, unlike the hack-job in The Departed, and the ending is better. What more could you ask for? Oh yeah, there is more ... no Nicholson over-acting, no bad Boston accents and the cops don't all act stupid all the time.",/review/rw1900945/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2021,SnoopyStyle,8," stylish crime drama
",It's cops and robbers in Hong Kong. Both deal in espionage and counter-espionage. Inspector Lau Kin Ming (Andy Lau) is a leading crime fighter and also a deep plant from crime lord Hon Sam. Chen Wing Yan is a trusted hand in the criminal organization and an undercover cop. It's a cat and mouse game. The only question is who is the cat and who is the mouse. This would be remade into the Academy Awards winning The Departed (2006). This is a stylish crime drama. The filmmakers obviously love their roof-top meetings and good for them to comment on it. The complications are done well. It has two of the best Hong Kong actors doing the young foils. Eric Tsang is excellent. It's operating at a top level. I do wonder about the 100 minutes running time. This seems like a Godfather type movie and could use up half hour more.,/review/rw1900945/?ref_=tt_urv

Expect to have to concentrate on who is who, especially at the beginning, who is or might be on to whom and how, and what they might decide to do about it.

24 January 2005,papalazarou,10," Wonderful
","A slick, intelligent thriller, which seems to be a mixture of both the Godfather and Heat - yet manages to be tighter, and more intense than the two. Both lead roles are suitably underplayed, allowing the stress and tension of the respective moles' jobs to show itself without resorting to Pacino-like over acting. Indeed, much of the film is told in dialogue, there are no ridiculous action sequences, and the final rooftop confrontation is both incredibly intense and masterful in keeping such a sprawling tale enclosed in such a small, yet fitting finale. It has been followed by two, equally wonderful films, but the original remains both a sophisticated piece of modern cinema, and a dizzyingly exciting thriller.",/review/rw1900945/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2008,Chrysanthepop,," The Worst of The 8 Hells Is Continuous Hell
","Wai-keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak's 'Mou gaan dou' is a gripping fast-paced thriller. Right from the beginning, it grabs the viewers attention. Although I don't understand why different actors were used to portray the younger versions of Lau Kin Ming and Chan Wing Yan (I mean people don't change that much in 10 years, do they?). There are a few plot holes here and there but otherwise the central plot is very well written. It's executed with great style. With fine editing, effective background score and excellent camera-work, the suspense and tension is well maintained. There's also some interesting symbolism, for example the use of the rooftop meetings (perhaps the place where Lau Kin feels safest), contrasting with the 'continuous hell'.",/review/rw1900945/?ref_=tt_urv
