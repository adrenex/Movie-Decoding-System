11 January 2019,ComedyFan2010,8," A positive movie
","Is this movie very original? Not at all. It follows the common formula of such self confidence movies. But it is lovely executed and I ended up enjoying every minute of it. It is very charming and positive. Positive not just in the main message (love yourself and be who you want to be) but also in the execution and how nice the characters are. Nobody is hateful and negative to others (except for that guy in the beginning who got what he deserved). There are no nasty jury who need to be proven something, no nasty contestants trying to sabotage you, actually no mean mothers. The only person one needs to prove something to is oneself. The rest of the women and girls are very nice to each other, which is so wonderful. And this is something that was kind of special in this movie.",/review/rw4499872/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2018,tbyrd-50088,9," Whatever Haters
","Is the movie an Oscar contender? No, but who cares. The movie has a great message and it's fun. I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. All you naysayers and haters, get some joy in your life and be entertained without tearing down. It's a movie for teens to learn the value of understanding who you are and living your best you. Something us 40 somethings need to be remind of too!",/review/rw4499872/?ref_=tt_urv

8 December 2018,zack_gideon,9," Feel Good Movie of the Year
","Not a Dolly Parton fan and wasn't familiar with the book, but this movie is just happy and uplifting. In today's negative news cycle of garbage, something like this is a ray of hope. This film spits in the face of stereotypes and hatred. It's all about LOVE. Thanks Netflix!",/review/rw4499872/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2018,senseofsight18,9," It you want warm feel good vibes this is perfect
","Full disclosure, I have not read the book so I saw the movie with virgin eyes and zero expectations. If you're looking for a deep, insightful comedy drama with a bunch of existential messages this is not the movie for you. If you're looking for warm and fuzzy feelings mixed with some sass and charm I recommend this movie. My belly didn't ache from laughing, but my mouth did hurt from smiling so much. If you watch enough movies and TV they all become predictable, but that doesn't have to take away from your enjoyment or the message of self love that this movie leans on. So found a comfy spot on the couch, grab some tea, and let the positive vibes flow.",/review/rw4499872/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2018,gatannahfiles,9," If you only watch this for how female friendships are portrayed...
","... that will be plenty. The young (and older) women in this film are supportive and kind to each other. Netflix has plenty of titles where women are enemies (or frenemies), undermine each other, try to get revenge, and are generally nasty in their own selfishness to be fulfilled. It is insulting to me as a women to be portrayed as though I feel like every other female is a competitor in some zero sum game where if they succeed, I lose something. So it's nice to see a film where women are not catty and petty.",/review/rw4499872/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2018,bef1991,5," Disappointed
",There was such hype about this movie and I love both Jennifer Aniston and Dolly Parton but I was so let down. The dialogue was very bland. I expected the story to be predictable but was hoping the actor's lines would inject life into it but sadly it didn't. Frankly the best part of the movie was Dolly Parton's music and little else.,/review/rw4499872/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2018,stasiakoroleva,10," Lovely film
","Really surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. Most Netflix movies are cheesy and predictable, but this one is truly heartwarming. The story is great and the dialogue feels natural. Dolly Partons songs are a real highlight as well, and the message is delivered organically in stead of being shoved down your throat. I would recommend this for a nice Friday film night.",/review/rw4499872/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2020,Warren-Watched-A-Movie,8," A great adaption of the young adult novel
",Jennifer Aniston was convincing as single mother Rosie Dickson who is still stuck in the accomplishments of her past. Whether intentional or not Rosie's daughter is left with the impression that in her mother's eyes she does not quite measure up. I was left with the impression though that from the perspective of Aniston's character she was just trying to protect her daughter but that was not what the daughter was understanding. She assumed her mother was ashamed when she was just wrapped up in her world and maybe at times emotionally neglectful.,/review/rw4499872/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2018,SamiCakes,10," Touching, Sweet, Heartwarming - I just feel good.
","What a beautiful movie. In a nutshell - I laughed, I cried, I aww'd (a lot lol), and this was exactly what the doctor ordered. I really, thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I think anyone who appreciates a well-rounded, well-acted, heartwarming and bottomline human story, will enjoy this.
Furthermore, Danielle Macdonald (the actress who plays ""Dumplin'), was absolutely fantastic in this, as well as Jennifer Aniston who I think has really come into her own and found her comfort zone when it comes to acting - she seems to just easily play ""right,"" if that makes sense. And lastly, the music throughout was such a delight - Dolly Parton is an amazing talent and this movie makes you appreciate that and her, so much more. Just wonderful.",/review/rw4499872/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2018,TalulaGrey,5," Not quite what I hoped for.
","I thought that I'd be okay with Danielle Macdonald playing a high-schooler named Willowdean, but my god she's 27 and looks to be 35. There is conflict in this film but it's all surface and we never get deeper into it. Jennifer Aniston plays the mom and she's good in her role. We don't get to see the mother-daughter conflict from both sides. Willowdean keeps telling us that her mom doesn't like/love her because she didn't turn out the way her mom wanted but, that is not what we see.",/review/rw4499872/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2019,aharon-izraeli,10," Pure pleasure from beginning to end.
","How anybody can watch this movie and dceide to be on the side of the haters is truly beyond me. I won't spoil anything for those who haven't seen it yet beyond saying that this is a pure feel-good movie.
Somebody wrote here that it's cliched , well. if a movie about learning to love yourself and see perfection in the imperfections of others is a cliche then sign me up.
You will need at least one box of Kleenex to watch this movie because you will be crying with joy and sadness ( only in one or two places ) throughout most of the movie.
If you love Dolly Parton then that's a major plus here... but even if you don't... her music is so fitting to the general atmosphere and essential to the plot that you'll find yourself falling in love with Dolly too .
In short. this movie is very very well acted, enjoyable and just a pure pleasure to watch and I can't recommend it highly enough.",/review/rw4499872/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2019,lanaliliya,3," Pity party
","This movie made it so hard to empathize or like the main character. She just lives in pity and tries to blame everything on being big, but she is just a negative person. I actually liked the other big girl in the movie and her best friend. I wish the movie didn't make the main character so unrelatable. The movie itself was very slow and boring. I was relieved when it finally ended.",/review/rw4499872/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2018,icymi-37906,5," Well meaning but poorly done
","I like Dolly Parton music,
I liked Muriel's Wedding (Ugly Duckling story)
I liked Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (Drag Queen story)
I like Jennifer Aniston.
I don't like this film.
I don't think they made the main character likeable enough, her chubby friend Millicent was way more charismatic. It's one thing if you make the lead big, but then you need to write her in a more charming, sympathetic way if you have a young handsome guy throwing himself at her.
She was just boring and depressing, and it made little sense why Bo at the diner would go out of his way to pursue her.
Jennifer Aniston was more likeable and she was the villain.
The actors were fine, but the script just wasn't good enough.
It contained all of the above listed elements, but they weren't brought together in a believable, coherent manner.",/review/rw4499872/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2018,ThomasDrufke,6," Diverts as Many Cliches as Possible
","Let me start out by saying this film is definitely not my typical area of interest. A movie about someone trying to upend the routine of a yearly beauty pageant in order to prove a point to her judging mother, is not something I would usually check out. However, with Jennifer Aniston involvement as the aforementioned Mother, I felt it might be worth giving a shot. Luckily, the film makes every attempt to divert expectations and avoid cliches, but it forgets how to right a lead character that can be someone you care about. She's every bit as judging and critical as her mom is but to other people. Of course, that's the arc 'Dumplin' goes through as she navigates her own sort of coming of age story. It has sweet intentions, is executed well enough to be watched but perhaps not well enough to be acclaimed.",/review/rw4499872/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2018,mike-68415,10," Great movie, great message!
",This movie really conveyed a positive message. Love yourself for who u are. The acting was great and it was done in a way that was not preachy! I think any of us with self esteem issues should see it.,/review/rw4499872/?ref_=tt_urv

7 December 2018,ramsayreader,7," Good, but not like the book
","The movie is a good, heartlifting movie with good music and enjoyable characters. Unfortunately it leaves out a lot of major characters and a lot of the book plot. If you haven't read the book you will like it even more, irregardless it is worth the watch.",/review/rw4499872/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2019,matthewssilverhammer,3," Aniston deserves so much better.
","I think this is supposed to be a comedy of some sort, but a negative amount of funny things actually happen during its runtime. There's so much self-pity and so many tiresome tears, you nearly miss that the whole thing just plays like a super long ego trip for Dolly Parton. Featuring the least likable protagonist of 2018, each character acts in equal parts atrocious and nonsensical.",/review/rw4499872/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2018,StrayFeral,7," Amusing

","I didn't really expect much when I turned on this movie on Netflix tonight, but I just feel really positive after watching it. It shows that you don't have to be like the people expect you to be. I was kinda worried that it will be just a stupid comedy (Aniston), but even she did a great job in this movie. Oh, and the guy from Lost is a drag queen. Just perfect. Really worth your time.",/review/rw4499872/?ref_=tt_urv
