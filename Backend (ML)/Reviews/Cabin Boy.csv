1 December 2013,A_Different_Drummer,8," More than a knockoff .. a very comfy comedy...
","Detractors of the series say it was ""merely"" a knockoff of Married With Children (which is like criticizing a sci-fi film for being similar to Star Wars) but a 4-year run is not bad for any comedy in this era. I felt that Addy and Gertz had both chemistry and comic timing. He could take prime steak and make it seem like hamburger. And she could do the exact opposite. In other words, perfectly matched, counterpointed, and making for a comfy little comedy where you looked at the characters like an extended family. The best episode was the one where the ignored and under-appreciated daughter played by Renee Olstead imagines herself on a nightclub stage bashing out a blues tune -- and does a fantastic job because she is a singer in real life -- and then gets completely ignored by the rest of the family ... again! Under-rated. Fun.",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv

17 December 2002,Eric-1226,," Good show. Still watching...
","I have watched only a few of the episodes so far, and I kick myself for not having seen more of the early ones, or at least having taped them. I really like what I've seen - I could watch this one all season!",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2005,stoogedude,," ""Still Standing""- I hope it's still on for a long, long time.
","I look forward to every Monday night to see Still Standing. It is a funny show, with good actors and a lot of talent. Mark Addy is the typical football loving, remote control addict father. He is very funny as Bill. Jami Gertz is a fun loving mother, who loves her kids, but doesn't care what they do. It's almost similar to Married..with Children, but not as dysfunctional. Brian is a brainiac who can't believe he actually lives in a family like he does. Lauren just tries to live a normal life with her friends, but can't escape the embarrassment her parents put on her. And Tina is witty girl who is unpredictable all the time. I fail to see how people can say they hate this show, because I enjoyed it from day 1. This is in no way a rip off of Everybody Loves Raymond. This is it's own show by itself. CBS has a hit on it's hands.",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2009,sumana-m21,8," Hilariously funny!
","What most people here who have written bad reviews about this show forget that this is after all JUST A SHOW!! It's meant to entertain and if you start comparing it to real life, you're being too biased. There are parents out there who are more concerned about their own lives, who act a little immature and in fact there is a child in each one of us. This show does take it to the extreme at times but doing it with humor makes it hilariously funny. I never get bored watching this show!! And you won't either. Judy and Bill have excellent chemistry on screen. And they really do not in any way build a bad impression on the viewers. Enjoy it!",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2013,doubleb58,10," Great show that deserved a longer run
","Still Standing is one of the better sitcoms of its time. It has many laughs, good characters (except one, which I'll get to in a minute), good stories, and good heart. It needed at least ten seasons, there are many more adventures that could have been told.",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2002,Aurthur,," The best comedy of the 2002 season.
","Despite the bad comments of this show I've read on this site, be assured this show is funny.  In fact, it's beyond doubt the funniest show of the new season.  Sure ""Good Morning, Miami"" had hotties Ashley Williams and ""Queen of Swords"" Tessie Santaigo, but it's nowhere near as funny.",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2002,mattymatt4ever,," Mark Addy is hilarious!
","So far, CBS has the best sitcoms.  I love ""Becker,"" but if any show has the right to replace its time slot, it's this show which perfectly tops off the Monday night lineup.  The pilot is jam-packed with big laughs.  Mark Addy is the perfect Archie Bunker-type TV Dad.  Jami Gertz is a great TV wife. She's also gotten a lot prettier over the years.  The second episode isn't as funny, with Addy's English accent slipping more often.  But I still liked it.  Hell, it was hard to live up to the hilarious pilot.  Hopefully, the show will continue to be funny and the writing won't get stale, because this really does look like a promising sitcom.  ",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2003,newnanj,," Irresistible rebels
","I could not disagree with the previous commenter more.  I loved ""Roseanne"" (for the first few years), I love ""The King of Queens"", I've grown to like ""Yes, Dear"", and I also *love* ""Still Standing"".  There is plenty of room for more stories about societal rebels who grow up, have kids, and are still rebels.  I find Mark Addy and Jaimie Gertz irresistible in terms of their comic timing as well as endearing because of the character they bring to the well-written parts.",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2021,alexpeychev,10," One of the funniest shows on TV.
","I too discovered this show after production ended. Its hard to find a good sitcom these days, and this show seemed to be like all the rest, a husband and wife with kids. It's been done so many times, but this show by far is the best. I never knew Jamie Gertz could be so funny. The entire cast comes together well, and the show is hilarious. I find myself laughing out loud multiple times during every episode.",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2019,13Funbags,7," A great sitcom.
",This is one of those rare sitcoms where the wife and husband don't hate each other and lie to each other all the time. They save that for the kids. I can't believe it wasn't more popular.,/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2002,docwho69,," One of the funniest shows on TV.
","You have to relate to it for it to be funny. Someone who can't relate will probably find this show lame, much the same can be said of shows like Yes Dear too.  Still Standing does not appeal to all audiences but my wife, myself, and all of our friends find it hilarious.",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2008,brendanchenowith,10," One of the wildest sitcoms ever produced
","This show bowls me over in every way. Jami Gertz successfully played 1,000 miles against type and Mark Addy was the perfect American dad. Renee Olstead, Taylor Ball and Soleil Borda were hilarious as ""THE THREE KIDS"". Nothing about this series was formulaic. Sure the parents, kids, annoying in-laws were all there, but this was not your typical series in that vein.",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2007,jwtrox08706,8," Still funny
","This is one of the funniest family sitcoms I've ever seen. It reminds me a little of Grounded for Life (another funny family sitcom), only a little less mature, so it's more family friendly, but the content is real enough to make this a credible show. It's a shame it's out of production after only four seasons. Yeah, it wasn't M*A*S*H or Full House, but it is certainly a breath of fresh air on television, and it certainly brightens my day to join the Millers in another misadventure of their everyday lives. I like Jami Gertz better in this show than any other movie or show she's done, but I don't know how I can say that because other than this show, I've only seen her in Twister, and I wasn't a big fan of Dr. Melissa Reeves, but I did empathize with her after the drive-in movie scene. Anyway, I also like Mark Addy's character as well. Bill & Judy Miller are parents that I almost wish I had. The comedy is great in this show. The lines never stop coming sometimes, and I find myself having to catch my breath from laughing so hard; it's almost like watching Robin Williams do stand-up...not really. But it's great. If it comes out on DVD, I'm totally buying it.",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2008,thewisetraveller,," Now, this is the kind of humor American TV needs.
","I caught this one by accident. It's smart comedy...not the stuff you have been watching on TV all your life. If you don't get it, take it for granted that you are real damn slow at humor and continue with the lame sitcoms.",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2008,nyyanks006,10," Love the show
","I too discovered this show after production ended. Its hard to find a good sitcom these days, and this show seemed to be like all the rest, a husband and wife with kids. It's been done so many times, but this show by far is the best. I never knew Jamie Gertz could be so funny. Never heard of Mark Addy, but he is hysterical. The entire cast comes together well, and the show is hilarious. I find myself laughing out loud multiple times during every episode.",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2007,Sylviastel,8," Why it's still standing?
","Simple, it can be a very entertaining show. Mark Addy who is British plays Chicago Bill Miller. Mark is better known for his performances in The Fully Monty and the British comedy classic, The Thin Blue Line. Mark does a first rate job at making Bill Miller into a blue collar American every man. His co-star Jami Gertz better remembered for her roles in the 1980s films, The Lost Boys, and Sixteen Candles does an equally fantastic job at playing Judy Miller. They were the couple from high school who married and had children. I love watching Sally Struthers play Bill's mom. She's fabulous and under-rated as a performer. She can do more than just play whining Gloria from All in the Family. Anyway the plots don't do the talent justice for the family. It was a surprise hit because I think we just miss family comedies. I think the actors who play the children also do a fantastic job at making us believe in them. Overall, it's a good show but not great. It's writing could be stronger to make this cast shine.",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2004,realmusicman,8," Worth watching
","The entire sitcom premise has run its course as of late without a lot of originality or true humour. However, I have found this sitcom to be the happy exception to the rule.",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2007,frank-phillips,9," Funny series - should still be making new episodes
","We watch this show on reruns every afternoon. It should still be in production, making new episodes. A feature length movie would be possible -- delving into Bill and Judy's earlier years. I think there is much to be mined about their youth -- neither had a great childhood -- their alcohol consumption in future years. All with lots of humor. I am compiling a list about the show, e.g. -- ""What the hell?"" -- Judy's 3 little words words before she let Bill kiss her the first time. I would love to see a reunion show on TV -- seriously! It could go into Brian saving his parents from losing their home after Bill loses his job. Lauren could become a famous singer. Whatever happened to Tina? She seemed to be most like her Dad. Brian and Bill must have a great deal in common. Bill's dad didn't understand him, called him a sissy, just like Brian's dad calls him a sissy and girlie. In retrospect -- was Judy really the bad girl in school Bill seems to think she was? Maybe, maybe not. Was she really out of his league or did she just play him as she does in every episode?",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2003,LisaRenee,," Absolutely Fabulous!!
","Anyone who can't laugh at ""Still Standing"" is a sniveling snob that lacks a street-smart sense of humour.  Mark Addy and Jami Gertz are a wonderful team that consists of Mr and Mrs Middle-Class America.  The common life they portray will keep you rolling from their hysterical imperfections and how they deal with them as a family. If we could all laugh at ourselves....what a wonderful world this would be.",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2006,horrorfilmx,," Live action ""Simpsons""
","Has anyone else noticed the resemblance between Bill the Dad in this show and Homer Simpson? Same cluelessness, same total subservience to his own appetites and whims, even similar jokes. Of course Jamie Gertz isn't Marge --- in addition to being much hotter, she doesn't have Marge's selflessness and old fashioned ""family values"". In fact, what we seem to have here is ""The Simpsons"" with two Homers and no Marge, which is kind of an interesting concept. And the oldest son is the brainy nerd, not the daughter. Okay, so it breaks down like this: Two Homers, a gangly teenage boy Lisa, a younger teenage daughter Bart, and Maggie has grown up enough to talk but still be the baby of the family.",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv

","I had held off ever watching this show for just one reason. Mark Addy is English. After seeing him in The Full Monty, watching him try to 'do' an American accent was just too painful.",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2005,Aidonian,," great show
","this show is one of the better shows I have seen in a while. I put it in the same category as Friends, Wil & Grace, Seinfeld, Yes dear and Married with Children. I watched Everybody loves Raymond, but after a while it starts to grow on you. Still Standing is better than Raymond or King of Queens. If you watch it you can see it has gotten their inspiration from Married with Children, but the family is not nearly that dysfunctional, even though the oldest son has lot of common with Bud Bundy, but he's no Bud Bundy. In my country, they show it every evening, with the exception of the weekends. It is one of the few things I actually stay home for in the evening and when I'm not home, I tape it just to not miss one episode. What is refreshing is that they don't try to be to moralistic like most comedy shows try to be. Here is what I think the married with children influences pay off. I mean, if you want lessons in morality, go to your religious leaders, not TV. Anyway, Brian is quite likable, like his younger sisters, Lauren and Tina. They are quite funny as are their parents. It doesn't feel forced at all and it doesn't need to grow on you. The sister of Judy; Linda is funny in her way, but here is where the drama part come in. Linda is kind of the outcast at work and in her family. Her family doesn't want her, neither does her co-workers. You do feel sad for her when she is being dumped or being ignored by her parents. I just love this show",/review/rw1135998/?ref_=tt_urv
