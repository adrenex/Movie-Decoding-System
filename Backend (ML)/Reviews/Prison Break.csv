24 September 2016,Wizard-8,," Mucked-Gyver
","When I was a teenager, the original ""MacGyver"" was one of my favorite TV series. So you may think that when I first heard they were rebooting the series I was pumped. Actually, my first thought was, ""Uh... I'm not sure about this."" That's because I have found reboots and remakes overwhelmingly are greatly inferior to the originals. But when I found that key people from the original series (like series creator Lee David Zlotoff and executive producer Henry Winkler) were returning, a little hope sprung in me.

24 September 2016,Dr_Sagan,," This is definitely NOT MacGyver...
",I used to watch the original series back in the 80s so it is unavoidable to compare that series with its 2016 reboot.,/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,nIGHTmAYOR,1," Weirdest Reboot Ever
",So basically the only thing they bring over from the 80s show is the weird hair cut MacGyver had that do belong to the 80s giving you the constant feeling this thing don't blend right with the scene .,/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2016,s3276169,2," Yet another second rate retread......
","Retreads seem to be the ""thing to do"" as of late. Studio's who seem to be out of ideas, visiting the past for inspiration. ",/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2016,Man99204,3," VERY Disappointing
",Angus MacGuyver is one of the most beloved TV characters from the 1980s. This is not the prequel that devoted fans were hoping to see.,/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2016,gs20,1," Tiresome beyond belief.
","If you were going to produce a show that was as uninteresting as say, Hawaii Five O, you could not do any better than this mess. The frenetic action is almost laughable in as much as the the completely unknown pig eyed hero ""star"" has absolutely none of the grace of the original Richard Dean Anderson. Sometimes no matter how much money one spends the result may still be crap. Poorly directed, poorly written, it is a total mess. Don't waste your time. It will, I predict, not last more than a season. Boring beyond belief. I suggest you turn your attention to British cop shows. At least they know how to develop a character. I think it's sad that George Eads thought he would do better here than with CSI ...... An astonishing miscalculation on his part.",/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2021,madameminty,2," This is not my Mac.
","They turned my boy into an arrogant jerk, made him into an annoying narrator, added NCIS hacking scenes, clichés, bad dialogue, shallow characters, childish comedy bits, cheerful music while the protagonists are being shot at and jokes while a character is dying... at them dying, causing them to come closer to death. The entire thing is not nearly as suspenseful, memorable, intelligent as the original. It's almost a parody.",/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2016,jonnithomas,1," It's a thriller/ detective/ james bondesque mishmash
",for children of around 12. however that may be an insult to some 12 years olds.,/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2022,jazzfi,2," OMG This is so stupid!
","This ain't McGyver. Maybe McGyver in name only. MINO. Richard Dean Anderson was McGyver. The reason we liked McGyver was because he was a.devout bachelor, free and independent, and worked alone. The girls watched him weekly because he was forever available, the guys because he was a crime fighting superhero. It was a formula that worked. (Remember Knight Rider with David Hasselhoff?)
With the exception of the name, and the little narrations, this rehashing of the old show bears little resemblance to the original. RD Anderson's McGyver was humble, down to earth, gracious, polite and likable, and the show was not just another ""A-Team, Mission:Impossible, Leverage"" team collaboration.",/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2016,henrik150693,3," Please, god, No!
","Almost cried cause it was so bad. Downplaying the audience like we're stupid. Guess target is 13 year old, but that's really stupid when the fact is that the high ratings come from nostalgic grown ups.",/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2021,kaefab,2," why do they feel the need to reboot series

19 February 2019,john070,8," Old vs new
","Original Macgyver was my favorite series. The new Macgyver is the favorite series of my son. He does not like the original one. I cannot like the new one as the original, but I am watching it together with my son and I find it acceptable. What I cannot afford however is the new soundtrack, I am always expecting to hear the original one and I am always disappointed.",/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2018,Michael_Takes,9," Great fun, terrific cast, exciting every episode
","I am really wondering if the reviews that give the show a bad score actually watched the show! I would love for IMDB to have some ruling that to review a TV series you have to have watched at least 5 episodes! Some people seem to be unfairly grading a tv series, solely based on it being a re-make!",/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2018,irevah,7," Underrated and fun to watch
","It's not as bad as the reviews says.
It's a funny cool silly action show.
Fun to watch",/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv

22 April 2018,brentstansfield,8," I also watched the old series
","While i also watched the old series with Richard Dean Anderson, I had a bigger problem with Anderson playing the roll, after many years as a soap star on General Hospital, than with the new guy. I eventually got into the old show, and it was pretty good. but the new one is better.
Other than George, these are fresh actors, and the FX are ten times better than the old show. Once you remember that this show was intended for a new audience, it's actually pretty good!
I have the 80's version on DVD, and after a side by side comparison the new show wins me over. Would it have been better to put Anderson back into this new series? No, he couldn't pull it off.",/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2018,godsdesign,8," Love this show
","I don't understand the complaints on this show. I grew up watching the original one. This one does a good job in it's own way. A reboot isn't supposed to be an exact replica. One of the main reasons I like this show is because it follows the same format as the original one but updated for 2018...not 1987: funny moments, still drama focused, well-rounded supporting cast, stuff blowing up and Macgyver inventions.

12 February 2017,xlars,7," Nope, it ain't all that bad.
","Having read several negative responses given to the «new» MacGyver, I cannot but say that so far I am not in agreement.",/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2021,ScoreArtist,1," CrapGuyver
",Just tried watching the pilot and it was terrible. What the hell is going on? I grew up loving the original and would never miss an episode. Richard Dean Anderson will always be MacGyver.... not this MacGruber-esc abortion.,/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2019,ronbell-23984,1," Jack Dalton replacement awful
","Jack Dalton was what held this show together. When his character left, this show fell apart. They have done a horrible job replacing his character with Desi, she is awful. I would suggest getting rid of Desi and perhaps reintroduce Dalton with a different actor or at least introduce a new character similar to him.",/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2017,joeroboston,9," Criminally underrated!
","Am I the only one who who enjoys this? It is not a replica of the original,but it is almost as good. The original is a classic,and it holds a special place in my heart,but the reboot is very well made! Lucas till does a great persona for our favorite problem solver,and even acts and looks like Richard dean Anderson! Did I mention Murdoc is even better than in the original,because instead of being plain crazy,he is a cunning and enjoyable villain! The other actors are pretty good too,including Justin hires! The fact this is disliked by a large population is a strange thing in my opinion! Don't listen to the reviews,watch this!",/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2016,AudioFileZ,4," Even Without A Comparison To The Original It's A Big Bore
","Perhaps this revival of MacGyver was made for folks like me that never watched the original series which, apparently, had quite a following. That would be fine if it was somehow compelling, it's not. Three in and I'm thinking this is a sinking ship",/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2018,cjase22007,8," Definitely worth checking out!
","Here we have an updated version of MacGyver. I know that some have said that it's a cliche, following after shows like CSI and the like. Yes, it is a cliche and follows a formula. That doesn't mean that it's not entertaining! What sets MacGyver apart is his knack to work with minimal resources. There is a nice twist in the first episode. 8/10",/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv

",Forget the original. Take that off the table. This show is actually pretty good. Great cast that work well off each other. Great chemistry. First season was a bit slow. Second season was great and continues. Couple episodes I teared up. Every episode I enjoy. Give it a go again people!,/review/rw4447640/?ref_=tt_urv
