","I understand why people might be down on this movie but I really enjoyed it. It had the right elements of the great party comedy. Great cast. Great party. Maybe I really enjoyed it because I was drinking along with it and wanted it to be good. But is that such a problem to have?
It did feel like it couldn't quite hit the punchline as well as I wanted it to. But if you want to have fun with it you will.",/review/rw3595081/?ref_=tt_urv

","I just finished watching Office Christmas Party without reading the reviews first. And now that I just read a couple pages of reviews I realize once again that there are a whole lot of humorless people walking on this planet. Not that it is the greatest comedy ever, far from that, but there are for sure enough sequences to make you have a good time. I just wonder what does make those negative reviewers laugh. Probably nothing. There are a lot of people that just never laugh, never have any fun in their pretty boring lives. I'm so lucky my wife has the same sense of humor as me, so that we have fun every day of the year. The story in the movie is not to be taken serious because it's just a comedy. Maybe with some stupid humor but it's still way better then a lot of other comedies. Kate McKinnon made me laugh the most, but the other comedians all added their bit as well to make it an enjoyable comedy to watch. Just don't expect too much of the story because it's not the point to have a great story, it's just about the fun.",/review/rw3595081/?ref_=tt_urv

","It is a few days to Christmas but you wouldn't really know it at the Chicago branch of Zenotec. Due to political correctness and the overzealousness of HR, there is very little in the way of celebrations. A quiet get-together is arranged but this is cancelled when the uptight, money-is-everything CEO (who happens to be the branch manager's sister) puts the kibosh on it. She also intends to retrench 40% of the staff at the branch. In a last ditch attempt to save the staff their jobs, the branch manager tries to land a major client. In order to show the client that they're not cold and uncaring, he (without his sister knowing) throws a huge Christmas party, and invites the client. Things could get rather festive, as long as HR don't have anything to do with it...",/review/rw3595081/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2016,blanbrn,8," A wild and far out feel good and sexy Christmas party movie!
","They make or have made so many ""Christmas"" movies over the years and with this entry called ""Office Christmas Party"" it clearly does not take things serious at all! It's one funny feel good dirty time a viewing pleasure to enjoy! The film has plenty of wit and funny jokes and one liners and comedy chemistry between the cast all while they party with alcohol and drugs! And to spice things up nice under the mistletoe plenty of scenes of ladies wearing sexy colored bras! The story is pretty simple just before the holiday season a witch and cruel like CEO named Carol(Jennifer Aniston)decides to destroy and cut jobs of the company that her younger care free and goof brother Clay Vanstone(T.J. Miller)works at! Only to help save the day are fellow workers business guy Josh Parker(Jason Bateman)and computer tech gal Tracey Hughes(Olivia Munn)as they plan a deal to save jobs with another company guy named Walter(Courtney B. Vance). And all of this will unfold with an epic ""Christmas"" party to save jobs! Aside from a little bit of a serious plot and theme of saving jobs, the film is a laugh feast of good times and vices as sure subplots! From the binge drinking of hard spirits and cocaine snorting to exposed body and private parts to seeing sexy women wearing red, pink, and cougar leopard print bras this party and film makes for one merry and naughty ""Christmas""! Overall well done comedy that does have a serious theme of keeping jobs yet it's carried by the vices of good times and spiced up nice with sex appeal.",/review/rw3595081/?ref_=tt_urv

",What a waste of a potentially funny talented cast. This year's big budget Christmas movie has about 10% of it that is funny - the rest is painful crude and unfunny. The premise has some potential but things run out of steam quickly. ,/review/rw3595081/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2016,HEFILM,3," Weak
","A lot of talented new and not so new actors and comedians appear in this and like a lot of movies with too many people in it, none get to do much. The set up takes a long time to build to the party but the set up is better than the pay off. It's just a formless mess by that point, the ""jokes"" become every character dropping the F bomb and most of the slapstick doesn't work.",/review/rw3595081/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2016,aciessi,1," Seasonal Depression
","Well, where do I begin with this? A comedy about office politics? Geez, where have I seen that before? If you're going to make a comedy movie these days, make it high concept, and if you can't, at least make it funny. Office Christmas Party commits the sin of being neither. Many film critics say this, but I haven't seen a comedy movie more deserving of this title... it's a 90-minute SNL skit.... oh wait, I'm sorry, Current SNL. It thinks it's a wild and crazy comedy, and oh boy, is it not. It plays it safe on nearly everything. It's as if Kate McKinnon's ultra-sensitive HR character directed the film. For a such a diverse cast of funny men and women, they are neutered of good material to work with. Jason Bateman is given nothing. Jennifer Aniston's character is one-note, though I'll give her credit for at least trying to make it work. Then, there's T.J. Miller. Dane Cook lite. He's currently being groomed as Hollywood's next hottest comedy star, and if he is, welcome to the dark ages. He is woefully unfunny. How did he make it out there? Why is it that so many amazing comedians, screenwriters and directors get turned down straight out of film school, and yet they give this man a shot? He gets the most screen time out of everyone here. It's quite sad actually. There are good performances in this, believe it or not. Kate McKinnon and the always funny Rob Corddry are the only two shining spots in this otherwise terrible film. I could go on, but why bother? I don't really need to, but when you spend 30 bucks for you and your friend to go see this in a theater, I feel the need to vent.",/review/rw3595081/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2017,childers-3,6," Better than I was expecting
","I dreaded seeing this. My daughter rents many videos on Redbox, but we consistently shot her down when she would bring this one up to rent. She finally rented it anyway. We sat down to watch it and I was ready to just play games on my phone until it was over. I was pleasantly surprised. It was not as bad as the reviews would lead you to believe. Comedy is a very relative, personal thing. What someone finds funny, someone else would not. I have strange taste in comedy. I like physical, silly comedies, but also intelligent satire, I'm kind of all over the map when it comes to what makes me laugh. This one, about a software company on the brink of failure, was pretty good. I laughed several times. It was a little long for a comedy, I feel they could have edited some scenes better. Two hours is too long for most movies, especially a comedy. I liked most of the characters and thought they did well with the script they were given. It's not rocket science, but it was entertaining and I'm glad she rented it.",/review/rw3595081/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2016,Troy_Campbell,4," Lightweight and disposable
","December always brings with it a raft of Yuletide yarns that are often fun but not overly great. This crude comedy continues that trend with an enjoyable yet completely disposable romp about the epic eponymous work shindig. When laidback office head Clay Vanstone (T.J. Miller) is warned his Chicago department (inherited from Daddy) is going to be closed down unless he can secure a big contract, his solution is to throw an expensive party with live animals, lots of booze and the promise of bonuses. Of course the proverbial hits the fan and everything that can go wrong, does. Think The Hangover: Xmas Edition where we actually witnessed the night unfold before seeing everyone wake up with killer headaches and life lessons learnt. The gags fly at a million miles an hour with some sticking and some not, but it coasts by on it's super light mood and the sense that this group of extremely funny people are just having a blast hanging out on set and cracking jokes. Miller's man-child and Kate McKinnon's HR by-the-book weirdo are the standouts, and Jason Bateman's and Olivia Munn's more sensible employees are fine (although lacking chemistry as love interests), however Jennifer Aniston and Rob Corrdry are total misfires which bore throughout. The film also dovetails quickly when it gives a pimp subplot way too much attention, and the save-the-internet finale is dumb even by a popcorn comedy's standards, although the eclectic Christmas-themed soundtrack is surprisingly good. The epitome of a throwaway movie, Office Christmas Party maintains a certain level of enjoyment with its breezy vibe and the occasional laugh-out-loud gag, but is ultimately forgettable.",/review/rw3595081/?ref_=tt_urv

8 December 2016,dave-mcclain,4," If you get invited and don't expect too much, you may well have some fun, but this is one party that you probably shouldn't reshuffle your plans in order to attend.
","Remind me never to go to an office Christmas party – or any office party for that matter. I'm just not willing to risk it. If the examples that appear on the big screen are any indication, these events are, at best, strange – or, at worst, downright scary. In 1988, ""Die Hard"" showed us a Christmas party that was taken over by terrorists! 2016's aptly named ""Office Christmas Party"" (R, 1:45) features people jousting with Christmas trees, heavy objects falling from tall buildings, people trying to jump tall bridges with their cars, pimps with guns – and party guests getting hospitalized! No, I don't ever want to go to any office Christmas parties, and if you're smart, given these cinematic cautionary tales, you shouldn't either. But should you go to the movie ""Office Christmas Party""? Well, that is the question now, isn't it? Clay Vanstone (T.J. Miller) is in trouble. He's the manager of the original branch of national technology company Zenotech, but his branch is struggling to pull its weight and his joyless and mean-spirited sister, Carol (Jennifer Aniston), the CEO of Zenotech (since Clay and Carol's father died) is threatening to close down the branch – or at least put a big lump of coal in the stockings of many of its employees. Clay, along with Josh Parker (Jason Bateman), his Chief Technical Officer and best friend, tries to figure out a way to save the branch. Josh's assistant, Tracey (Olivia Munn), thinks she has an innovation idea that could do the trick, but Josh thinks that her idea isn't ready to demonstrate. Instead, the three of them focus on the strategy of winning the business of prospective client Walter Davis (Courtney B. Vance).",/review/rw3595081/?ref_=tt_urv
