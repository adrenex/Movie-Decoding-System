11 October 2020,pawanpunjabithewriter,9," This is PURE GOLD for Cricket lovers!
","Documentary? Well, that's not what I'm looking for was my first reaction when I got to know about it. But being a die hard Cricket fan, it was always on the cards I could give it a go anytime. I knew I was going to witness the ball tampering incident in this series. However, as soon as I watched the first episode, I was awe-amazed. I had never thought in my life I would be able to watch such a brilliant Cricket Web Series in my life. I loved the Australian Cricket! I loved the ruthlessness. We can never think we will be able to watch so much of the dressing room talks, scenes, team meetings and so much.
This was all behind the scenes that happens off the field. Australian Cricket has been exceptional over the years.
However, I have heard this from some not many that the Indian Cricket side is shown to be good off Cricket. But I deny after watching that. I see Virat aggressive and arrogant on the field. In the test series, I have seen live Rishab Pant bantering and abusing Australian batsmen behind the stumps, which is not good. No doubt, I love Indian team. But we should have leaders like MS Dhoni and Rohit Sharma in the cricket team - cool, composed and smart.
What I didn't like was Indian Fans were not shown as a bright part of the cricket.
Leaving all that, this series had goosebumps. It had all you must have never seen before. I would like to see an IPL team's journey like this.",/review/rw5639455/?ref_=tt_urv

","What an absolute treat to watch, stunning visuals. As an Indian the BCCI or any other cricket board doesn't have the courage to show the insides of the cricket game like cricket Australia did. Raw emotions and attitudes of players inside from the dressing room captured in a beautiful way.",/review/rw5639455/?ref_=tt_urv

13 March 2020,svsrriitkgp,10," Excellent series
","Enjoying it so far, thought it will be a normal boring documentary till 2nd ep, but once you enter next episodes it addicts you with its wonderful scenes and emotions, wish other teams would also do like this. I have watched 5 eps till now, will update my review if reqd later, thanks.
Update: now that i have finished all the eps, the series only gets better with each episode, if u r a cricket fan or not u will love this series.",/review/rw5639455/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2020,Minhaz923,9," One word: STUNNING!
","An absolute stunning documentary that shows post effect on Australian Cricket Team as they go through a transition after a big blow due to ball tampering scandal. The sound effects are sensational as well as the camera shots are amazing! The interviews and the inside stories of dressing room makes this documentary more and more intensive!
Don't miss out on it!",/review/rw5639455/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2020,peterrichboy,8," An English perspective
","I really enjoyed this series and in particular the dressing room scenes, team talks and coaches meetings. However I couldn't help but feel this was made to try and redeem Australia's reputation after the shameful ball tampering in South Africa. That is quickly dealt with in episode one. From then on it's a jingoistic succession of how great it is to wear the baggie green and Represent the great country that is Australia. It would have been nice to have heard perspectives from opposing captains journalists. Instead every interview is with an Australian journalist player coach and Justin Langer in particular. Every interview is played with a patriotic soundtrack. The only time in the Australia were any good was when the cheats came back into the side in particular Smith who single handily carried that team through the Ashes. Smith smashes the poms and all is forgiven. Not by me Smith shamed his country the sport and can count himself very fortunate to still be playing the game.",/review/rw5639455/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2021,briscouver,9," Loved it
",As a Canadian living in Australia for 15 years watching cricket to me always seemed like punishment. After watching this I am completely hooked. Loved seeing the personalities and gamesmanship behind the sport. Really in-depth look behind the scenes of a complete rebuild of a team and it was wonderful to watch. Really enjoyed it....,/review/rw5639455/?ref_=tt_urv

13 March 2020,amitjodha99,10," A must watch for every cricket/ sports fan
","Cricket is a great game, and it deserves a lot more exposure than it gets. This documentary actually caters to redemption that Australian cricket team needed and for a fan like me, it was really great to see how things really work while the cricket is happening on the pitch, and what are all the emotions going on behind everything visible.",/review/rw5639455/?ref_=tt_urv

24 April 2020,jasonhodder-32490,10," Roller coaster
","Watching the Australian team go from the lowest of lows to the highest of highs, is a emotional roller coaster.
Seeing Steve Smith dominate the game, then feeling sick to the stomach seeing him knocked out, is something you'll never forget.
One of the best docoseries I've ever seen.

14 April 2020,sriramthestranger,7," Good Management Lessons on Team Building!!
","Its a docu-series that starts from Sandpaper gate incident at Capetown and ends with the Aussies retaining the Ashes in the English soil. There are good lessons on team management when they decide to follow the motto and build the culture of ""We not me"". Its one thing, that bought the revival when the team won the ODI series in Indian soil without Warner and Smith after trailing 0-2.",/review/rw5639455/?ref_=tt_urv
