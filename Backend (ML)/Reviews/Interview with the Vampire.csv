20 August 2022,efd-10467,9," Finally, an Original Idea
","This series was a total surprise, curious, intriguing and funny.",/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2022,GeorgeTinNYC,9," Clever.
","To be frank, I can understand the first reviewer's position. However, the story was developed and was more interesting in the last 15 minutes in the first episode and kept me throughout...I am stuck to my screen because I want to see how these parallels and mystery unravel. It's a clever story, and far more a mystery than a comedy. Which is why I think it has ""6"". Lastly, these main characters, who are married, have made several choices that are poorly crafted which can be a turn off. Primarily, researching in a foreign nation while drinking. Other than that I'm tuned in and want to see where this goes!",/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,nordicsoul,7," Tonally all over the place, but well worth the ride!
","Tonally it's all over the place, but something about The Resort kept my attention long enough for this seemingly rom com based mini-series to take a dark existential turn.",/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2022,shamzin-35127,10," I love it. I was laughing and intrigued. The whole thing is just absolutely excellent.
","Has a good family vibe too. Totally would recommend 100% This is after viewing two episodes. Its especially not a bad thing to watch as a couple, or a family, or even with older kids. But its perfectly good if you just want something to un wind with. The beautiful scenery helps too. Really good chemistry between the leads. You will wish they were your friends and you could actually invite them out for drinks on Friday. Its not for everyone, but for people who have been looking for a good new mystery series, this is 100% on target.",/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2022,claeyscemolo,7," After 1ep
","Show is better than 5.8 especially by today's standards. It's funny, intriguing, and is a mystery. Acting is also good. Not sure what people's complaints are. Give it a go.",/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,apaskevi-1,10," Really, Really, Really Good So Far
","I'm telling everyone I know about this show. I absolutely love it so far at the end of episode 3. Never heard of it or anything before today, but I love White Lotus and other retreat/resort based drama/comedies, then I saw Sam Esmail's name pop up at the bottom of the screen as an EP, and I decided I would watch at least the first full episode.",/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,julieshotmail,6," A mixed bag
","""The Resort"" starts out with a beautiful premise, reminiscent of HBO's fabulous ""The White Lotus."" It offers enough mystery to keep you going episode after episode. While you are wondering what's going on, you do get treated to some nice scenery and decent action scenes. In addition, it is always fun to see Skyler Gisondo doing comedy along with Nick Offerman. However, some of the other acting in this series is inconsistent and borderline cringe-worthy. And not before long, the plot line also becomes scattered and frustrating. Just as something finally gets interesting, it is followed by disappointment. No bite. You get a hollow feeling as you try to absorb the explanation of the series of events. As of this writing there is no season 2 planned, making the non-cliffhanger both a lame and unsatisfying way to end things.",/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2022,Oscarjbunting,8," Underrated
","I stumbled across this show while looking for something to watch and went in with pretty low expectations (giving the initial rating for this show), maybe my low expectations played a part on how much I enjoyed the show however I found myself enjoying it. As a huge ""High Maintenance"" fan I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Ben Sinclair directs the first few episodes and has a role in the show.",/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,arod_85,8," Not what i was expecting...
","This show was so different than anything I had seen before. Just when i thought it was going to be one way, it headed in an interesting and unique (albeit odd) direction. When I initially saw the trailer, I thought it was one of those cheesey horror series. The show initially had a 5 rating on IMBD. However, after revisiting IMBD a few weeks later, the rating had jumped immensely so I thought I would give it a go. I initially thought I was in for a decade long cold case for two murdered/missing teens, but it turned out to be something more complex and ""out there"". The cast is great. There are no weak links as far as acting and character development goes. The show has its endearing moments, comedic moments, sci fi and mystery. Definitely worth seeing and I hope there is a season 2.",/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,MartoMcFly,," I don't understand...
","Why is this getting Rating Bombed?!? It's an amazing mystery (so far), very well acted and directed. I'm intrigued and hooked after 3 episodes. I just don't understand the 1 Star Bombing! All I can think is it's because of the lead, interracial married couple...and if that's the case - that's just sad. I almost didn't give this show a go because of the 5.3 rating. Glad I ignored the haters.",/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,susanneburns66,8," Very intriguing
","I watched this despite the low rating, after reading some of the reviews. And I definitely agree with the higher scoring reviews. Great show, I'm really intrigued as to back stories of characters and how it's all going to turn out. Great bunch of lead actors.",/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2022,anthony_ian,8," Super Original and Somehow Funny Too
","It's hard to describe what this show is because I've never seen anything like it. Not surprising, because the Executive Producer behind it was the guy from ""Mr. Robot"". It's not like that show at all though, which had an almost drug-induced haze/look to it.",/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2022,JDJ1990,9," Through Three Episodes
","As noted by other reviewers, I was a few seconds away from turning off the first episode 15 minutes in. But I like Cristin Milioti and William Jackson Harper as actors, so I kept going. I'm glad I did. The second half of episode 1 is far more compelling than the first half, and after three episode I am completely hooked.",/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2022,superkt,6," I've seen better, but also seen much, much worse.
","Well, I don't hate it but I find the characters themselves sort of boring. So far, the story behind the mystery is moving a bit slow but is enough to keep me interested thus far. The actions of the main couple are pretty questionable from the get go. Are they really wandering through an abandoned, run down resort in Mexico? One that is potentially connected to a gang or cult? That's a stretch even by horror movie standards. At least the younger couple can blame their actions on their naivety. I am curious how this ends for them all.",/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,kellymeg-01504,10," Amazing!!
",Just finished episode 5. This show is so awesome and interesting. The acting is really great. It is a comedy and a mystery and it is also emotional as well. Just great all the way around. I'm going to be sad when it's over!,/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,grantpryde,9," Funny and thrilling
",Good acting always helps a show like this and they have that here. Good script and great characters make this well worth watching. Good pace and laughs.,/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,Happiness_Stan,8," Curiouser and curiouser...
","The first three episodes were amusing enough; a necessary setting up of characters and scenarios and whatnot, but after that, a large pinch of Cosmic weirdness, an even larger dollop of spaced out Thomas Pynchon-esque Noir intrigue and a hint of Borges as the characters fall down the rabbit hole has made this an unexpected treat. If your tastes stretch to any of the aforementioned, you should give it a try.",/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,stephentibbles-71735,8," Refreshingly intriguing.
",The potential this show has is amazing. All the acting is well done and pushes the storyline forward brilliantly. A lot is riding on how it will all be pulled together. Alex is the linchpin to everything. Watching exposition being rapidly erased into a blackhole and only being able to see bits and pieces as it disappears.,/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2022,laqsheyo,6," 1st episode review!
","The episode wasn't engaging enough in the starting, I wanted to leave it in between, but the performance of Cristin Milioti was awesome as always so decided to watch the full episode. In the starting of the episode, it was confusing why the lead actress (Emma) is so obsessed about the disappearance of the two adults and the way she got the first clue, an item, and she started looking into it, searching on the internet and all, the direction was poor there, it looked stupid and unreal but by the middle of the episode, the episode starting making some sense and got better. Wlliam's performance is good too, loved his acting in the good place show also. Till now, the show is above average. I will be watching the remaining episodes.",/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2022,guardianofthewhills,10," Such an amazing show
",Give me more! I haven't seen such an original concept in literally forever. I couldn't stop thinking about it between episodes. Recommend!,/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,hqdmj,," great show and great music too!
","Love all the actors here especially the two starring! , but did not expect this story! So so good! Definitely a nice watch during the summer!",/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,AfricanBro,7," Update: It gets so much better, stick with it
",A teaser popped up as cinema ads before the movie starts playing so I thought it was going to be a movie not series. Half an hour episodes seem a little short for the mystery they're trying to solve but it's better than dragging out an episode to an hour.,/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2022,mgools,8," Breath of fresh air
","Not sure how to write 600 characters to say this was a fun film. The acting was good, the story was fresh enough, and most characters were very likeable. One of the better new series I have seen in a while. If there is a season 2 lets hope they don't Hollywood it up. This was a binge watch, and I am feeling a little guilty about how much time I spent on the screen over the weekend, but it goes to show you, the show just pulls you in. Always wanting to know what is going to happen next. I almost forgot, they even has some good humor for a change. If you want a fun show to watch, this is it. You doubt you will be disappointed.",/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,cherold,8," From comedy mystery to Lynchian oddity
","My view of what The Resort was changed over time, although the clues to what it actually was showed up pretty early.",/review/rw8532788/?ref_=tt_urv
