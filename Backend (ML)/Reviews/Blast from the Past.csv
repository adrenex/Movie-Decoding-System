","Overtly nostalgic movie about a bunch of kids stumbling on a secret weapon blunder while making a zombie flick. Yes, it is an obvious hommage to Spielberg, that much have been said.",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2019,aivilovee,9," Magic
","Look, I'm biased. When I first saw the movie in 2011 while I was still just in middle school, I was enamored. Now, 8 years later, as a film student inspired by this movie, I can honestly say that it still holds up. A lot of the love I have for this movie is purely fueled by nostalgia, but even aside from that, the thrills and heartstring tugs this movie delivers still stand up to the test of time so far. This movie is always going to mean the world to me, and I hope someone out there sees this and gives it a shot. It's so criminally underrated and under-appreciated.",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv

1 August 2012,ma-cortes,7," Six friends spend their time making a terror film when takes place weird deeds and something more terrifying than any of them could have imagined.
","Entertaining film with funny situations , state-of-art special effects and interesting screenplay ; according to J.J. Abrams was homage to the producer of the film, Steven Spielberg, and his films of the 1970's ranging reverence from Spielberg's directorial films . This Spielberg production is a fun movie concerning a feisty bunch of underprivileged kids whose Super 8 filmmaking project is about to be destroyed by weird events . During the summer of 1979, in a small Ohio town a group of friends (film debut of Joel Courtney and Riley Griffiths) while making a super 8 Zombie movie (since the kids were making a zombie movie, there are several references to director George A. Romero , as the poster for one of his movies in Joe's bedroom) witness a catastrophic train crash and soon suspect that it was not an accident. Shortly after, unusual disappearances and inexplicable events begin to take place in town, and the local Deputy (Kyle Chandler, Jeremy Renner declined the lead role ) tries to uncover the truth - something more frightening than any of them could have thought - and investigate subsequent unexplained events in their small town. They spend one last adventure-filled Saturday Afternoon together when one of them is kidnapped (Elle Fanning , sister of Dakota Fanning who during the town hall meeting, for a brief second you can spot among the assistants) . This happens after they find a film about their teacher , that could be the solution to all their problems . ",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2020,filipemanuelneto,7," Interesting mystery sci-fi film
","This film is an interesting mystery sci-fi that revolves around a small group of teenagers with a passion for cinema. They have a common project for a film, but end up witnessing a major rail disaster while filming. It is immediately clear that the accident is very unusual, and that the military's interest in what happened is far from normal. Set in the late Seventies, a remarkable decade for sci-fi thanks to the fascination of aliens and technology in general, it is a film of familiar contours where mystery is well used.",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2011,bruce-149,6," Been there, done that
","As an homage to the Spielberg films of the 80's, this movie succeeds. As a piece of original entertainment? Nothing happening, folks. Now, if you're a kid and have never seen The Goonies, Jaws, ET, War of the Worlds, and Cloverfield, you may think this film is absolutely wonderful. And judged through the lens of cinema history, it may well be looked upon as a culmination of all that came before.",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2011,chaos-rampant,," Prometheus Bound
","Abrams has proved to be a talented cameraman. I don't mean this in a condescending manner, at least not entirely. But that's all there is with him, shape and contour. He's yet to situate himself within a worldview - so he borrows from where it is convenient to fit into. Here it's Spielberg - his world of wondrous discovery, magical escapade into comfortable menace, but where everything is wistfully made right again.",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2011,TourettesPersonal,8," Mixing Their Trademarks
","The concept of ""Super 8"" is combining the elements of J.J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg. The trailer made you think it's like E.T. plus Cloverfield. Well, it's true. There is nothing new about ""Super 8"" but it brought us back to the good old classic times, it's funny, it's exciting, and it's amazing.",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2014,moonspinner55,5," E.T. with tentacles and a bad temper
","Teenagers in 1979 Ohio, filming a Super 8-mm movie for entry in a competition, witness a derailment at the train station; assuming the kids have the incident on film, a hard-nosed colonel with the U. S. Air Force is soon on their trail, but he knows more than they do. Boys' adventure story-cum-monster movie from writer-director J. J. Abrams, who is slavishly faithful to producer Steven Spielberg's homey touch throughout. The scenario never jells and, although the production is elaborate, the narrative is scattered to the winds. The kids, leftover Goonies, have obviously been cast for their physical differences (one short, one tall, one with braces, etc.), but their personalities are one-dimensional on film; they're generic (much like the picture itself) and fail to generate interest-but I wouldn't blame the young actors, it's just not there in the writing. ** from ****",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2011,bkoganbing,8," Another Alien Just wants to go home
",I'm not sure why Super 8 could not have been set during the present rather than in 1979 which is so identified because at the beginning there is mention of the famous 3 Mile Island nuclear disaster over the radio of the protagonist family. I do believe it may be set there because this is the era that producer Steven Spielberg knew first hand as a young man and the one he personally identifies with.,/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2012,Smells_Like_Cheese,9," Good times
","Growing up, I was in the generation of a lot of great kid's films like The Goonies, The Sandlot, Monster Squad and Stand by Me. But sadly my generation seemed to be the last one where we had great kid films that not only insulted it's demographic, but also had the great adventure that we needed. Watching those movies were just a great time and they've remained classics ever since I think because we haven't had a movie for a couple of decades. Steven Spielberg was the man who brought a lot of these classics alive, who better to collaborate with J.J. Abrams who knows great action and obviously has a love of the movies I just mentioned. They bring us Super 8, the trailers remained so mysterious and made you want to see the movie, because all it was, was a car crashing into a train and you had to guess what just jumped out of it. Sadly I had to wait until the rental, however what a great movie that I feel people are being just a little bit rough on.",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2011,TheLittleSongbird,8," Very good film, final act not so much
","Super 8 was one of the movies I was looking forward to all year and while it was slight disappointing I enjoyed it immensely. Super 8 looks absolutely great, with superb effects and cinematography. The score also fits well with the movie without feeling too generic, it is tautly directed by Abrams and the script and characters are engaging with the feel of a Spielberg film which made Super 8 somewhat nostalgic in a sense. The story, making the most of an intriguing concept, does have heart and poignancy and also quite intense, while the acting particularly from Elle Fanning is very impressive. Also, the train crash set piece is simply spectacular. If there is a let down though, it is the final act, which feels like a different movie altogether. The looser it gets, the less tense and more heavy handed it gets, and that's a shame because the rest of Super 8 was excellent. Overall, started off excellent but meandered making the final result just very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2011,still_the_dre,6," I was expecting so much more...
","I don't make movies or review them. I am simply someone who loves going to the movies and have seen more than I can count. I was waiting for Super 8 for about 6 months. I saw the early trailers, was involved in the viral campaigns. I was amped to go and experience another great JJ Abrams film.",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have never seen a movie which could be divided to two parts of ""absolutely amazing"" and ""boring and childish"". The first 80 minutes is awesome, I was shocked by how good this movie was as I had seen some bad reviews on IMDb but then the cheesy part kicked in and ruined the whole thing.

11 June 2011,lcofeer5,8," When you see a bike fly, walk out of the theater and make up your own ending
","The film is about a town mystery looked through the eyes of children. From the early part of the movie, you feel like something powerful and dangerous is lurking around and is going to jump out on you at any moment. Ever-multiplying questions tease your brain and a suspense is building up at the back of your mind right up to the end of the story. ",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2011,Fields201,4," J. J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg Collaborated For This?
","I wanted to give this film an 8. As the film went on, I was giving it a 7, then a five, and finally I settled with a 4. It's sad because this is one of those movies that I anticipated for a year now and I can't believe this was the result.",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2011,Jonathon_Natsis,6," Forward To The Past
","Super 8 is J.J. Abrams' ultimate tribute to the films that defined executive producer Steven Spielberg's career around the same time in which the movie is set, back in 1979. It contains elements of Jaws, The Goonies, E.T and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, while also working in later favourites like Jurassic Park. But you know this already, mostly because everyone in the media discussing this film seems to be falling over themselves to remind you of how good Spielberg is. While I don't dispute this, Super 8 is Abrams' child, so without further ado, let's see what he can bring to the table.",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2011,rogerdob,1," Nothing's really explained!
","The movie is quite interesting...for about 30 minutes. Then things fall apart. It slows way down. Strange events happen over and over (and over again!) However, I was still interested in finding out what was really going on and wanted to know the cause of the events. However, the ending is quite contrived and everything that happens to save the day happens quite conveniently. But the real bummer is that nothing's really explained. Just like in Abram's TV series LOST, he doesn't bother to give answers to a whole bunch of questions. However, the worst part of this movie is the last two minutes...it's unbelievably schmaltzy and not worthy for anything but a movie that's intended for six-year-olds.",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2011,DonFishies,9," A wildly nostalgic and truly spectacular must-see event
","As the marketing and hype started to build for Super 8, I decided to try my best to not watch any real trailers or promos for the film. It was a difficult task, but somehow I managed to pull off allowing the film to be a mystery leading into its release. When I got the opportunity to see the film in advance fell into my lap, I did not second guess the hype – I ran to the theatre as fast as I could. ",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2011,paul_haakonsen,5," Just another CGI treat without a solid story.
","The trailers for this movie initially made me watch it, and I had high expectations to the movie, given the facts that it was Abrams and Spielberg who made the movie. And now that I have seen the movie I am left with a bit of a hollow sensation.",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2011,bigbillyt,4," Mixed, could have been good but falls flat
","Wow, I really, really wanted to like this movie. I had mixed expectations going in. On the one hand, I expected a typical Spielberg style kids vs. monster type flick, on the other, I have been disappointed by Abrams before with Cloverfield.",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2011,ungy357,10," One of the great ones
","In 1979, in the fictional town of Lillian, Ohio, a preteen boy named Joe Lamb is trying to cope with the recent death of his mother, who was killed in a factory accident. Much to the frustration of his father, the town's deputy sheriff, Joe copes by immersing himself in a project lead by his best friend, Charles. That project is a horror film, shot on a SUPER 8 camera, and Charles has enlisted the help of not only Joe, but the rest of his misfit friends, and has surprised everyone by talking Alice Dainard, the prettiest girl in school, into playing the hero's wife. On the night of the first big shoot, the would be filmmaker witness a train crash. Pretty soon, the town of Lillian is swarmed by military men, who won't tell anybody what is going on. Abrams and Spielberg may be the only two people in Hollywood who still know how to keep a secret, so I won't spoil that by going into the plot too much further. But I will say that Super 8 lives up to every bit of hype and expectation surrounding it. This is a beautifully crafted, emotional, funny, scary, thrilling movie that enthralls an audience the ways Spielberg's 80s classics did. And this is coming from someone who has been accused of ""worshipping"" Spielberg. Abrams has recreated the look and feel of vintage Spielberg expertly, down to the last detail. For a Spielberg fan, it's an absolute joy to behold.",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2018,Hey_Sweden,8," It definitely has some charm going for it.
","""Super 8"" is a surprisingly engaging, heartfelt ode to vintage Steven Spielberg (think ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"") by writer / director J.J. Abrams. It focuses on a tight-knit group of young friends in the summer of 1979. Right now, led by their director, Charles (Riley Griffiths), they're busy making their own shot-on-Super-8 zombie epic. VERY early one morning, they're at the local train station filming scenes when they manage to record a catastrophic train crash. Not only there is much destruction, but a stealthy *something* escapes from the ruined train and vanishes into the night. Soon, the military shows up to try to contain the entity and keep a lid on the matter.",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv

11 June 2011,MacMurrah,1," Pathetic waste of time
","Wish there was a 0 rating. The movie was absolutely awful, how many times will directors try to stuff ugly alien with amazing technology down our throat.Very slow narration and build up. Reminded me of Ang Lee trying to put a personality behind The Hulk. So many loopholes in this movie , we are to believe the thing kills its victims, okay it doesn't, what does it use them for? Just too predictable. We see the thing getting out of the train in the first bit and we have to almost wait an eternity to see its ugly head again, and its not worth it. For all the hype that was thrown its way it hasn't delivered, and anyone comparing it to ET, get a grip , a bit of bottle and see the doctor. The movies are poles apart.",/review/rw2442059/?ref_=tt_urv
