17 August 1999,Spleen,10," Shakespeare at his most exhilarating
","Be honest: does the idea of a Shakespearean joke make your heart sink a little?  Do you think of obscure, lowbrow Elizabethan humour that MAYBE someone was kind enough to explain in a footnote?",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2003,bob the moo,," Wonderful sparky fun which only flags in the final 10 minutes
","The arrival of Don Pedro and his men at the home of Seigneur Leonato in Messina brings about much celebration.  The spirit of love and happiness is alive in the party and Count Claudio and Leonato's daughter Hero make woo and engage to marry within a week.  To pass the time Don Pedro makes a pledge to engage confirmed bachelor Benedick and the bickering Beatrice together in a tower of affection.  However Claudio's brother, Don John, conspires to break up the wedding by making accusations against young Hero. Will it all be much ado about nothing?",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10," Kenneth Branagh, I salute you!
","Apart from Roman Polanski's quite disturbing Macbeth, Much Ado About Nothing is possibly the best film adaptation of a Shakespeare play I have ever seen. Director Kenneth Branagh managed to make an appealing film, without straying too far from the play. In fact, I think this is his best film as a director.",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2001,Theoriginaltruebrit,10," I am quite confused about the reviews
","Personally I loved the movie, from the opening credits to the last brilliant tracking shot.  What I do not understand is the dissing of Keanu Reeves' performance.  I can just imagine Ken sitting around his kitchen table with his casting director saying ""okay we have this brilliant ensemble cast, the movie is going to be great, what can we do to completely screw it up? I know let's cast Keanu Reeves as Don John and completely snarl up the whole thing"" Personally I think Keanu made a great villain, and I trust Ken's ability in casting to choose the perfect actor for the part.  I do not think that in reality that Ken would cast someone so hopelessly inept as others have posted in a part that is so essential to the plot.  (and don't give me the star power excuse cause they already had Denzel Washington)..., I have always said that Shakespere done right is brilliant.. (done poorly it is pathetic)  and this is Shakespere done right in the purest sense of the term.  To listen to Ken and Em deliver Shakespere's lines is to listen to them as they would have been spoken and acted when they were written.  It is a revelation and pure joy.",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2001,Skeletors_Hood,10," Truly Wonderful! A great movie!

13 August 1999,kimmb,10," Stunning and witty--Shakespeare at his best
","Kenneth Branagh has done so much for Shakespeare...I've almost become a complete zealot of his work. This screen adaptation of one of Shakespeare's lesser-known comedies is absolutely divine. The lovers Claudio and Hero are completely and wonderfully upstaged by Benedick and Beatrice, the most perfectly mismatched pair in the history of love, exactly as they were meant to be. The chemistry between Ken and Emma is so believable (after all, this was filmed before their marriage ended), the lines are so cunningly delivered, and the plot is so beautifully twisted and resolved that this movie is at the very top of my list of favorites. The setting is absolutely gorgeous--Italy in all its Summer glory. You can fairly taste the sunshine. Each part is completely delightful (Michael Keaton is perfect in one of the most bizarrely comedic roles I've ever seen, and as far as Keanu Reeves' performance, all I can say is that the part was written to be played in that manner. Don John was a bad guy of necessity--every comedy must have a foil). I found the entire production to be beautifully done and quite up to the professional standards that I've come to expect under Branagh's excellent direction. The wit sparkles and cracks between Beatrice and Benedick; a direct counter to the more traditional and borderline sappy form of Elizabethan love exhibited between Hero and Claudio. *This* is how the wise woo, and no, it is never peaceably! A smart, funny and visually stunning gem of a film to add to Branagh's already distinguished repertoire. I'm waiting for his MacBeth.",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2003,sarastro7,10," Best Shakespeare film ever
","Unlike some people, I'm not letting Keanu Reeves' ""acting"" ruin this film for me. He has such a small part, and I'm sure Branagh was fully aware of what he was doing when he cast wooden Reeves to play a wooden role. Reeves is indeed the one substandard thing about this film, but even so, it somehow works (Reeves' role, I mean). This film is about rapt joy and ebullient vitality, and Reeves' flatness creates precisely the contrast that makes his character stand out as totally unfit for the world presented in the film, just as the beginning of Richard III establishes Richard as unfit for *his* times (only, he had enough cunning and opportunity to really foul things up!). There is no mistake, neither on the Bard's nor Branagh's part, in casting Reeves as Don John.",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2001,o_levina,10," Brilliant! And sure to make people interested in Shakespeare once again
","It's one of the most delightful adaptations of Shakespeare ever made. Personally, I am a great fan of Shakespeare, but it seems that the film must appeal even to those who normally don't like the Bard.   Kenneth Branagh is at his best both as producer and performer. I admire his imagination and ingenuity, which he applies to his work. He created beautiful, picturesque, entertaining, amusing and hilarious movie with awesome actor's work and fine music. Some cuts of the original play were essential to make the movie dynamic, and the play was not considerably damaged. All members of the starring cast make Shakespearean text sound natural, alive and very funny. Emma Thompson shines as bright ginger-haired Beatrice. It goes without saying that she's an actress of unique talent, and in this film she does an amazing job, being lively, sharp and witty, sparkling with energy, humor and cheerfulness, or sometimes vehement and passionate (when her cousin is offended). Branagh as Benedick is up to her. Other notable performances are given by imposing Brian Blessed (seigneur Antonio) and Richard Briers (seigneur Leonato). Robert Sean Leonard and Kate Beckinsale as Claudio and Hero are adequate and beautiful pair. Keanu Reeves is really good in the part of grim, villainous Don John, notwithstanding opinions of many reviewers here. Michael Keaton's Constable Dogberry and other comic characters makes me laugh a lot through the film. Definitely, this is an excellent film for enjoyment. 10/10.",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2004,alainenglish,," A real summer movie (spoilers)
","""Much Ado About Nothing"" is a real summer movie. Director Kenneth Branagh, who also adapted the Shakespeare play, has assembled a talented gallery of British actors (along with a couple of American stars) who really gel together and bring the film to life. The result is a film with plenty of wit, chemistry and gusto.",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2004,angel_de_tourvel,9," A beautiful film to enjoy
","I saw this one or two years ago, and I loved it utterly. Not only has it a great cast including shakesperian actors Kenneth Brannagh and Emma Thompson, it also has a lovely, warm feel to it; set in the sunny countryside of Italy; perfect to watch on a summer's evening.   Although I am a dedicated admirer of Laurence Olivier, the legend who's reputation Brannagh is often set up against; I must admit that nobody would ever suit the role of Benedick as Brannagh does He was perfect; fun, natural and wittily amusing to watch. As for Emma Thompson; she gave a fantastically fiery performance as Beatrice of the untamed tongue; watching she and Brannagh go for each other in their satirical arguments was fantastic.",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv

","Don Pedro (Denzel Washington) and his men along with the villainous Don John (Keanu Reeves) visit his friend Leonato. Don John is the prince Don Pedro's bastard half-brother. Benedick (Kenneth Branagh) spars with Leonato's niece Beatrice (Emma Thompson). Young Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard) is in love with Leonato's daughter Hero (Kate Beckinsale) and plans to wed. Dogberry (Michael Keaton) is the lead night watch constable. Don Pedro tries to entice Benedick and Beatrice together, and Don John tries to disrupt the wedding.

21 July 2006,JamesHitchcock,10," A Film about Everything that Makes Life Worth Living
","Prior to ""Much Ado About Nothing"" most memorable cinematic Shakespeare adaptations were based upon his tragedies or histories. Thus we had Olivier's trilogy of ""Henry V"", ""Richard III"" and ""Hamlet"", Welles's ""Othello"" and ""Macbeth"", Zeffirelli's ""Romeo and Juliet"", Heston's ""Antony and Cleopatra"" (something of a rarity, but still worth seeing) and the Brando/Mason/Gielgud version of ""Julius Caesar"". Shakespeare's comedies were less common in the cinema, probably because so much Shakespearean humour is based either upon puns and wordplay which worked better in Elizabethan English than they do in the modern language or upon topical references to the events of the 1590s and 1600s, lost upon today's audiences. There was that old ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" from the thirties and Derek Jarman's rather eccentric version of ""The Tempest"", but generally the cinema took the view that the comedies were best left to the theatre and television.",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2022,boblipton,9," You Had Me At Shakespeare
","Looking at a Shakespeare comedy that's well performed is always a pleasure for me. Looking at at one that has been shot like a movie with a gracefully moving camera makes it even better. Add in a cast composed of well-trained British actors (like Branagh, then-wife Emma Thompson, Brian Blessed, Kate Beckinsale, etc), and top it off with some Americans who can perform their roles well (Denzell Washington; Michael Keaton in the clown role), and I am in heaven, even with Keanu Reaves' earnest but annoying Don Juan.",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2018,classicsoncall,8," ""There's a double meaning in that!""
","Reading Shakespeare is nothing like watching Kenneth Branagh direct Shakespeare. He interprets the Bard in a way that commands your attention and allows you to have a good time doing it. I actually first viewed the 2012 version of this movie done as a modern day retelling of Shakespeare's classic comedy, and I have to say, I found this work much more satisfying. It was much grander in scale and the characters came to life in a much livelier fashion. All of the principals did a fine job in their roles, and I'll go out on a limb here by saying that I enjoyed Michael Keaton's Dogberry character the most, just because he brought so much humor and wit to the role. That's not to take away from the romantic elements at the center of the story, as the principal players all turn in marvelously impassioned performances. What I wonder about is how the actors can memorize their lines of Shakespearean dialog and deliver them with such stunning ability and competence. It seems there's not a wasted phrase or moment that doesn't add clarity to the story. This is one Shakespeare inspired film I could watch again and again.",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," A terrific Shakespeare story of love, betrayal and the battle of the sexes
","William Shakespeare, a man ahead of his time who wrote some of the world's most beautiful and wonderful plays. He wrote tragedies, romances, comedies and one of his best comedies/drama that's personally my favorite Much Ado About Nothing. Kenneth Branagh directs another wonderful Shakespeare movie about love, reputation and the battle of the sexes. His chemistry with then wife Emma Thompson was so wonderful that made the movie just a delight. You can't help but smile with Much Ado About Nothing, making you just love life and to remind yourself that sometimes the good guys do win.",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2010,KnightsofNi11,7," Branagh excellently supports an already excellent Shakespearian story
","Whether you enjoy it or not, it is a solid fact that William Shakespeare was one of the best, if not the best, writer of all time. His tragedies and comedies set so many milestones in storytelling, and have continued to influence all creative mediums today, including film. The man obviously had an influence on Kenneth Branagh, the director of Much Ado About Nothing. This film is one of five Shakespeare film adaptations that Branagh has directed. It is about two lovers, Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard) and Hero (Kate Beckinsale) who are to be married in one week. To pass the time they devise a ""love trap"" for two of their family members. One is an arrogant and yet bumbling bachelor named Benedict (Kenneth Branagh) and the other is the strong willed and witty Beatrice (Emma Thompson). But in the midst of it all a man by the name of Don Jon (Keanu Reeves) conspires to stop the wedding. Overall the film is lighthearted, simple, and fun. However, it retains a much more sophisticated eloquence that definitely sets it apart from other films equally as lighthearted as it.",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 1999,Burgundy,," Awesome Shakespeare!
","I love this movie! Great story, wonderful cast, good photography. Kenneth Branaugh is the funniest as a witty, likable guy. His facial expressions and vocal streachs are the best! I think he is one of the best Shakespearian actors of today. Emma Thompson is great. Denzel Washington very cool, I felt so sorry for him when Beatrice refused him, though he is a little too good for her. I love his character though, how he likes to fix everybody up and make them happy. Robert Sean Lenord was a little sappy, but it was pretty fitting for who he was. He needs more roles like this and Dead Poets Society. Micheal Keaton and his little side-kick (poor guy!) stole the show! Hilarious! Hero didn't do anything for me though. She was pretty, but didn't have much to say, it seemed like she was watching the others most of the time. The best part of this movie is when Benidick and Beatrice hear about the other's love and realise they love each other. The photography is best when Beatrice is swinging and Benedick is splashing in the fountain! I'm hooked on Shakespheare now, I'm planning to watch the version of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" coming out with Michelle Pfeiffer, not to mention any Shakespeare movies I see with Kenneth Branaugh in them!",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2002,Agent10,9," A fun and inspiring film
","While Kenneth Branagh has made a career out of making Shakespearean film, he creates a true masterpiece, despite the mainstream tendencies that are littered throughout the film. Denzel Washington, Michael Keaton and Keanu Reeves give the film a visual perspective unlike any other Shakespearean film I've seen. It was a welcome relief to see these two instead of just a bunch of stuffy British actors. A great film to watch, one that was both understandable, yet high brow enough to give art film lovers a show.",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2013,HelenMary,8," one of the most joyous and uplifting films of all time
","One of Shakespeare's greatest romantic comedies, adapted and Directed by one of Shakespeare's greatest aficionados, Mr Kenneth Branagh, this film is brilliant. The ensemble cast make the film a wonderful viewing experience; Richard Briars, Brian Blessed, Kate Beckinsale, Robert Sean Leonard, Keanu Reeves, Emma Thompson, Imelda Staunton, Denzel Washington and Michael Keaton to name a few. It is filmed simply, as a costume drama, making the most of a country house and gardens in Messina, Sicily.",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 1999,Coxer99,9," Much Ado About Nothing
","With exception to the idiotic casting of Keanu Reeves, this is a perfect film version the classic Shakespeare romantic comedy. Branaugh and Thompson are perfectly paired as arrogant jesters who find themselves in a game of matchmaking, compliments of Denzel Washington, Richard Briers and Robert Sean Leonard. The highlight of the film is the bawdy performance from an unlikely performer in a Shakespeare film in Michael Keaton. Keaton is energetic and lively in his performance of the befuddled Dogberry. Branaugh also directed this lavish adaptation that was nominated for a Golden Globe.",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2013,KineticSeoul,8," A well done adaptation of Shakespeare's work
","This is based on a classic William Shakespeare's play. Which is a comedy that revolves around two relationships and finding love. One is the two older quick witted, fiery and experienced characters that doesn't admit to their feelings for one another. Because of pride and that tug and pull game. And the other is two love birds that blossom with attraction and romantic feelings for one another. And a villain that is trying to scheme and manipulate the situation. I personally thought this film actually did a good job of keeping up with the spirit and essence of the William Shakespeare's play. And all the actors and actresses did a good job. Especially Denzel Washington who owns his role with ease and without much forced effort. The young Kate Beckinsale is also in this and all I can say is, she looks better as she ages...For now at least. Personally I thought Keanu Reeves did a fine job playing the villain. Except maybe the part where he gives a villainous laugh. This is Shakespeare's play done well, and if your one of the audiences that enjoy Shakespeare's work. There is a high chance you won't be disappointed with this one.",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2014,runamokprods,7," Uneven, but terrific at it's best
","Not my favorite Shakespeare play, lacking the rich, playful complexities of some of the Bard's other comedies, I've always felt on a pure plot level this feels more simplistic, ill-logical and forced than most of the works by the greatest writer in the English language.",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2005,lee_eisenberg,10," Well done, even if Keanu Reeves always looks like he's about to say ""dude"".
","Kenneth Branagh perfectly adapted Shakespeare's play about love and deceit in a Messina villa. As Hero (Kate Beckinsale) and Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard) are about to get married, they try to get Benedick (Branagh) and Beatrice (Emma Thompson) to wed, and at the same time stop despicable Don John (Keanu Reeves) from doing anything nasty. The entire cast is just great, and Michael Keaton is really funny as Dogberry. Denzel Washington may not be someone whom we usually expect to see in an adaptation of a Shakespeare play, but he's quite impressive here as Don Pedro of Aragon. This is one movie that won't disappoint you.",/review/rw1222189/?ref_=tt_urv
