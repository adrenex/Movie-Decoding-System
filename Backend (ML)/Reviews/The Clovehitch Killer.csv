","The issue I have with this film is that it reveals the identity of the Clovehitch Killer much too transparently and early enough to make the mystery a bit of a letdown. I saw the attempt by Don Burnside (Dylan McDermott) to shift blame to his invalid brother Rudy (Mark A. Nash) as a too convenient alibi and didn't hold it as credible for a minute. And for the detailed and careful madman that he was, the idea that Don misplaced a crumpled up bondage photo of a cheerleader in the cab of his trunk was way too much of a stretch. And if you think about it, the idea that emanated from that circumstance that Tyler (Charlie Plummer) was a 'perv' was never really reconciled with the facts by the end of the picture. Even if Tyler's Dad went missing, the 'perv' accusation would have still been out there with his high school associates. And what's the story with Don Burnside's final intended murder victim that was saved by Tyler and Kassi (Madisen Beaty)? She didn't die, but simply disappeared from the story as if she couldn't add a thing to authorities about the events that took place in her own home. All of this was just a little too sloppy for this viewer, although the clove hitch clues at 58:40 and 1:27:12 in the picture at least lent an air of acceptance to the movie's title.",/review/rw4467232/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2018,stevepat99,9," This film deserves a serial killer Merit Badge!
","We have all seen many 'is my neighbor a serial killer' films. This one brings the issue to the family forefront i.e. is my dad a serial killer. The cookie cutter, white bread, merit badge driven, church devoted father and son were way fun to watch. Does scout leader dad have a secret serial killer merit badge? The 'clue' fun starts very early on, its exact meaning unclear, and never lets up. Roles played to the 'T' by son Tyler/Charles Plummer a sweet innocent, church going scout, who meets perversion head. From there, things spiral in some beautiful non-predictable directions. Dad Don/ Dylan McDermott is a super savvy macho man, loving dad who might just a serial killer. Introduce the charming Madison Beaty playing Kassi who adds a needed level of mystery to the tale as she also spices up Tyler's life.",/review/rw4467232/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2021,kodiakblack,7," The ending sucks and makes no sense at all. Great build up to a disapointing end.
","So.. Really bad ending. Bo closure for anyone. No justice. The evil murderer gets to go down in history as an amazing man. Loved and missed by all. The son has to spend the rest of his life pretending he misses dear old dad so much.
Thats BESIDES the obvious criminal charges that the son would face. They would 10000% tie him to the murder of his dad after 1. Neighbors saw him in town with a gun on his back in broad daylight when he was supposed to be at camp. 2. The camp would confirm he never showed. 3. The father has blunt force trauma aside from his gunshot wound. 4. The fathers blood is in the womans home when he was struck repeatedly and bleeding. They would have checked her house over where 5. They would find the sons fingerprints in the basement on the window. He grabbed it. I checked. Ect ect.. But also when hes caught and he tells the truth.. Do they believe that? Therea literally NO proof now. So... Yeah. Suck ending.",/review/rw4467232/?ref_=tt_urv

6 April 2019,W011y4m5,7," The neverending story...
","At times extremely effective, deeply disturbing & uncomfortable to watch, The Clovehitch Killer is a relatively satisfying & well made film that's worth a watch - but it's also a classic example of a movie that doesn't know when to end - dragging out the resolution until you're willing the credits to start rolling; every scene feels like it's setting up the conclusion until it's followed by yet another & you're left impatiently waiting for the crescendo, which is tedious, frustrating & disappointing.
However, the performances sell the entire film & there's palpable tension between characters in emotionally charged scenes so the conflict is incredibly well done & regardless of its faults, it's still a good film - despite being unnecessarily long & drawn out.",/review/rw4467232/?ref_=tt_urv

",Tyler (Charlie Plummer) is a teen living in a quiet conservative town. His father Don (Dylan McDermott) is the leader of his boy scout troop. He has his stay at home mother Cindy (Samantha Mathis) and his younger sister Susie. The town is still traumatized by serial killer Clovehitch who for some reason stopped 10 years earlier. Tyler uncovers disturbing evidence suggesting his father as the serial killer. He befriends outsider Kassi (Madisen Beaty) who is obsessed with the killings.,/review/rw4467232/?ref_=tt_urv

6 April 2020,Evighat,6," Liked it until....
","I have just finished watching this movie, and I must say that I would have loved it despite it not being an intense thriller or gore-filled horror. That's not what the makers were going for anyway. The movie is meant to be emotional, perhaps slightly brooding and dreamy, which makes for a different kind of attempt at telling a serial killer story. This will not suit everyone, and those viewers expecting something violent or frightening will be disappointed. I personally wasn't expecting anything at all and, because I immediately cared about the protagonists, enjoyed watching it almost from the outset. But why, oh why did they botch the ending like that???",/review/rw4467232/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2019,ricky_dry_county,9," A movie that leaves deep prints
","What's sad is that there must be hundreds of such psychos living in America under the guise of normalcy. It turned out to be a brilliant movie, I was skeptical since I don't particularly prefer serial killer films as they often choose to glorify the nurcase as some unique specimen. The pacing doesn't look forced and acting is spot on, especially the young actors. The cinematography is phenomenal and one will have no trouble suspending disbelief.",/review/rw4467232/?ref_=tt_urv

16 November 2018,ljulien,7," Could you even picture yourself in this situation ?
","This was a good movie, but not an easy watch. To avoid any spoiler I am just going to point out the fact that this movie puts you deeply in questioning, in a kind of disturbing way. And that's good. It's not your typical serial killer story here, really it's more like "" how would you sort out this high level of sickness... because even as a watcher, well you witnessed it and have to live with it !.
This is slow paced, just enough to build this uneasy tension. Thumbs up to the camera work, we get some real artistic framing and lightning here. And also, most importantly, let applause the fantastic acting of the father and son characters. You'll find yourself diving in this with them after just a few minutes.
A solid 8 for me. Warning : You may need a drink after this.",/review/rw4467232/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2019,Samthesham67,9," Very good!
","This might sound weird, but this was a refreshing take on the serial killer genre. The momentum throughout was calm, sometimes a little slow but always engaging. I kept scratching my head trying to work out how this film was going to pan out and I was pleasantly surprised, a slight twist at the end gave it an air of credibility and brought the story to a satisfying finale.
Very good film with excellent acting, thoroughly enjoyable.",/review/rw4467232/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was a great movie that portrayed what a serial killer would be like living a life of normalcy. It reminded me a lot of the BTK killer (who lived not too far from me) in that the Clovehitch killer was a family man who ran the scout club and was loved by the entire community, seemingly making this an incredibly weird and creepy film for me. The kids were great at playing their parts, especially the boy and had me feeling all sorts of emotions with him. The whole film was tense and left me on the edge of my seat. The ending was great as well, and I loved the part when they showed the scenes again leading up to his son showing up to his dad's last kill, except showing it from the kids' view. It was a bit on the slow side and not entirely action packed as one would hope, but it was one that seemed to get into your head a bit. Overall it was a great one to watch.",/review/rw4467232/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2018,jadavix,6," Should have been better
","I wanted to like ""The Clovehitch Killer"" more than I did. Many ingredients are there for an interesting movie. I think the direction is the key flaw here. It doesn't take its premise as far as it should have, to really make you feel something. It seems to approach some fairly uncomfortable viewing, but never make good on it.",/review/rw4467232/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2018,TwistedContent,6," Intriguing, but underwhelming slow-burn thriller
","Many positive reviews & ratings convinced me that I have to see this. Here's my thoughts:
First of all, I wouldn't call this a horror exactly, it does not justify the genre for it doesn't use enough genre-defining elements - there's no gore or scares (I don't mean only jump-scares, duh) & the level of creepiness and suspense in the atmosphere falls short to be called ""horror"". My point is, I was a little disappointed, because, reasonably so, I was expecting a horror movie.
The story here brought up memories of the recent ""Summer of '84"" which was similar regarding the plot, but was served in a drastically different style. The story is the most effective weapon that ""The Clovehitch killer"" possesses, 2nd most effective being the performances - Dylan really nailed the role of the most dad-ish dad who's secretly a perverted serial killer. As the story progresses, it... does not progress fast enough. There's a thin line between ""burning slow"" and ""dragging"", this film went both over and under that line.
The on-point cinematography very well accompanied the main story & committed to the creepy small-town-full-of-weirdoes atmosphere. The visual style & vibe really reminded me of the ""The Strangers"" - grounded and realistic, yet scary at the same time.
The 2nd part of the movie picks up a bit, shows more of the weird stuff you've been expecting for the last 50 minutes, ultimately making it worth for you to hang around.
If you like them eerie slow-burns, pick it up and have a blast, but if you are not familiar with them, be careful - you might be disappointed. My rating: 6/10.",/review/rw4467232/?ref_=tt_urv
