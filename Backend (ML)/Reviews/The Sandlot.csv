","In what seems to be the near future, a married couple and their young daughter deal their ""techno-sapien"" android/nanny Yang ceasing to function. As the husband tries to get him (note, not ""it"") refurbished, he learns more about Yang's life, both with his family and the one before he met them. ""Technos"" like Yang are equipped with memory that allow them to record a few seconds each day, and in some of the film's finest moments, the husband gains access to these. It's touching to see what was notable to Yang, who is more human-like (or even Christ-like) than machine, and Kogonada explores what it means to be a conscious organism in a world where technology could possibly create consciousness.",/review/rw8370756/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2022,siderite,9," Beautifully shot, well acted, with deep and subtle symbolism, a bit slow
","We immediately see that we are in the future because everything has great style and space and nature, Colin Farrell is married to a beautiful and exotic black woman (who kind of treats him like dirt because he doesn't earn as much) and they have a Chinese daughter and a human looking android. Then the android breaks, leaving the family, but mostly the little girl, bereaved. It is up to Farrell's character to understand why it broke, untangle the complex rules of service and/or replacement in a corporate ruled world and also discover who their android actually was.",/review/rw8370756/?ref_=tt_urv

",Jake (Colin Farrell) and his wife (Jodie Turner-Smith) have an adopted Asian daughter Mika (Malea Emma Tjandrawidjaja). They obtain an Asian looking android named Yang (Justin H. Min) to be her brother and help her learn about her own culture. Yang malfunctions. We then find Jake attempting to have him repaired for about half an hour. Then he manages to read snippets of Yang's memories and spends the rest of the film looking at them and contacting previous owners to emotional piano music.,/review/rw8370756/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2022,A_Different_Drummer,7," gentle and lyrical and flawless
","So few of these hi-concept lo-budget sci-fi films succeed, it is important for both critics and viewers alike to honor those that pull it off. That said, to argue that the brilliance of the film lies in its ability to leave the viewer with weighty thoughts afterwards is to miss the joy and compassion of the film in real time. Not Marvel. Not even especially commercial. But, for what it is, flawless. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

6 March 2022,Jithindurden,9," Brilliant
","In 2017 I decided to watch the nominees of most of the well-known award ceremonies and the Independent spirits awards had multiple nominations including best first feature, best first screenplay and best cinematography for the movie ""Columbus"". That was the most pleasant surprise I had that year because unlike most of the other films I've heard for the first time by checking those lists, ""Columbus"" blew me away by its visual language. It said a ton even when the movie itself stayed simple and didn't rely too much on exposition. So, I was excited about Kogonada's second feature and he completely delivered.",/review/rw8370756/?ref_=tt_urv

8 March 2022,danieljfarthing,2," A dull, morose, pretentious & nonsensical turd
","Colin Farrell's long liked art-fart tosh (witness ""The Lobster"") but writer / director Koganda's dire sci-fi drama ""After Yang"" is a new low for him. In the near-future he & Jodie Turner-Smith find Justin H Min (the cyborg they bought to keep adopted daughter Malea Emma Tjandrawidjaja company) has suddenly stopped working. Trying to fix him Farrell plods thru the likes of Clifton Collins Jnr & Ritchie Coster, bogged by a depressing score and painfully slow pretentious dialogue on the nature of life, death, after-life, family, belonging, etc. What does it mean? Anyone enduring this waste of acting talent deserves to know... but almost certainly won't. It's a turd.",/review/rw8370756/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,guskeller,9," Strikes a chord
","After Yang sneaks thought into small moments. Although the narrative is straightforward, it examines complex themes. Set in the not-too-distant future, an android helps a family raise their child. The android suddenly malfunctions and the family struggles to get him working again. Along the way, their relationships evolve, they learn about the android's personal life, and their understandings of existence deepen. Existentialism, significance, and love are delicately considered, feeling genuine yet rich. Despite announcing very little, After Yang evokes powerful emotions that will have viewers contemplating what really matters. True to science fiction, the film is philosophical, psychological, and dramatic.",/review/rw8370756/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,El_Jefe,4," Pretentious and boring

19 March 2022,gortx,," Touching and thought-provoking look at A.I.
","Like with his previous feature, COLUMBUS, Director Kogonada has fashioned an evocative tale about communication. Taking the form of a sci-fi film, AFTER YANG concerns a married couple, Jake (Colin Farrell) and Kyra (Jodi Turner-Smith), who have adopted a Chinese girl Mika (Malea Emma Tjandrawidjaja). In this unspecified future, a family can employ a surrogate android sibling, here named Yang (Justin Min). Yang acts not only as an older brother, but as a tutor who gives Mika a richer understanding of her Chinese heritage. When Yang malfunctions, the parents scramble to repair him, during which time they are able to 'plug in' to his memory chip.",/review/rw8370756/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2022,ThurstonHunger,8," After is the New Before
","I plan to read the Alexander Weinstein short story on this, perhaps I should have read it before instead of after. I suspect the story will have less layered topics than the film does. Of course there is an AI aspect and concomitant concepts of consciousness, but add into the mix foreign espionage in high-tech gadgets, grey tech markets, museums of plastinated flesh, adoption across cultures, and elements of classism. The futuristic world depicted does not necessarily feel alien, but definitely alienating.",/review/rw8370756/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2022,boggie4758,4," Paint dries so slow
",I kept thinking while watching this movie was is this all there is? The movie literally was like watching paint dry...I probably would get more out of watching the paint. This movie is dull and I didn't get anything out of it. It was like a art movie that you don't get anything out of. I didn't like this movie at all. I couldn't stand the tone of voice the actors were using..almost like they were whispering in a monotone. A very boring dull movie. Not my cup of tea so to speak....,/review/rw8370756/?ref_=tt_urv

","I would like to say ""It is a very good production about questioning human values through Artificial Intelligence..."" but especially in the last 20 years, so much work has been done in the field of streaming, cinema and literature that Kogonada's film is a very solid cinematographer. And it offers nothing new to the audience other than a great Colin Farrell acting.",/review/rw8370756/?ref_=tt_urv

7 June 2022,masonfisk,6," SHORT FILM EMBIGGENED TO UNNECESSARY LONGER LENGTH...!
","An indie film set in the future from last year. Colin Farrell & Jodie Turner-Smith are raising their daughter w/the help of a robot which they bought refurbished. The parents begin to worry when Yang, Justin H. Min, starts to malfunction & what his potential absence will have on their daughter which prompts Farrell to venture out into the world to find out his background which includes visions of a girl, played by Haley Lu Richardson, who meant enough to him she's still in his memory banks. Taking a page out of other scifi outliers like Blade Runner, A. I. & even to some extent the Will Smith actioner I, Robot, this film's message of a robot achieving its own consciousness is lost in its fey, flowery delivery as it feels (which reading the head credits this film was based on a short...probably the best format for this), even at its short running time of 90 or so minutes, bloated by unnecessary visual deviations & flourishes making this at best a beautiful ad for a B & B & at worst a waste of my time. Also starring Sarita Choudhury & Ritchie Coster as robot merchants w/Clifton Collins as Farrell's neighbor.",/review/rw8370756/?ref_=tt_urv
