26 March 2013,wildsparrow16,10," Crap. I'm sucked into this show.
","I really don't have time to be hooked on another TV show, but I'm sucked in. This is very suspenseful - I have not been bored for a moment. I really like the addition of Dylan. He adds some edge to the show, although it's already pretty gripping. I really thought this would just be some gore-fest - it's not (although there are some grisly scenes). It really is intriguing - the family dynamics and characters. I look forward to more. I loved Vera Farmiga in Higher Ground and Orphan - I will check out more of her work. She is very versatile - a fine actress. I am not familiar with the others, but they are pretty awesome, too.",/review/rw4959158/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2013,phd_travel,," Riveting - worth watching
",The pilot was quite riveting. The lovely and talented Vera Farmiga is excellent as the complicated possessive Norma Bates. Freddie Highmore doesn't yet have the creepiness of Anthony Perkins but it's early days lets see how things develop and he transforms. The supporting cast looks promising too.,/review/rw4959158/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2013,OJT,8," Riveting, well played prequel idea
","The last thing I like to do is watching a series. I prefer films. Ended stories. However I could not resist watching the first episode of this idea of a nowadays prequel which is to explain how Norman Bates could become like he did in the classic Hitchcock movie Psycho. A strange, but still kind of compelling idea.",/review/rw4959158/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2018,tylerjac-590-218503,10," Vera Farmiga. That about says it all.
","Bates Motel is a binge worthy, down and dirty, yet artfully crafted masterpiece. Add the talents of Vera Farmiga, Freddie Highmore and Nestor Carbonell and you have the holy grail.",/review/rw4959158/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2013,smorrow2-1,8," Wrong and getting wronger -- in just the right way
","I know this show is clicking because my 21 year old son squirms through out the show in total discomfort over the Norma and Norman relationship. He wanted to dump the show after the first episode but came back for the second. I'm sure he'll be back, almost against his will, for the rest. The main actors, Vera Farmiga as Norma and Freddie Highmore as Norman are spot on perfect. They have the look for sure, but more importantly, they have the psychology down perfect. Things are played in such a way that that mother/son kiss could be construed as normal, innocent affection, but you know damn well that something is wrong and getting wronger. There's a lot of story going on in this show -- a lot of mysteries to keep you hooked. Highly recommended.",/review/rw4959158/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2018,katiehigson,10," Bloody brilliant
","Managed to binge the entire 5 seasons in one week! The acting is incredible. I laughed, I cried and I hid behind a cushion. It's got everything you could want from a psychological horror drama. Couldn't reccommend it enough.",/review/rw4959158/?ref_=tt_urv

20 March 2013,kemority,9," If 'Psycho IV"" had been made into a TV series...
","An avid fan of Hitchcock, I thought this pilot was well done. Though, it was interesting to see an iPhone ring in Mother's house, being this is set in the modern day. Olivia Hussey left some big shoes to fill after her portrayal of Norma Bates, but I think (given this pilot) Vera Farmiga was well cast by the producers. ",/review/rw4959158/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2016,Rob-O-Cop,9," Nuanced, subtle and believable.
","It's rare to see such a perfectly scripted and acted,cliché free TV series come out of America. The show paints full interesting characters to give a simple horror movie meaning and reason. Of particular note is the chemistry between Norman and his mother Norma, bickering one minute and doting the next, petty, confused, worried, loving, you can see the train wreck coming but you understand how it gets there and it makes sense. Norman is believably normal, but broken, and you feel for him, understand how he got to be where he will ultimately end up. Everyone is great in this show but also of note is Nestor Carbonell's bent cop Sheriff Romero, who's flexible morals ebb and flow with the circumstances. I love his responses to Norma, and the many ordeals he has to weather. He's a brilliant character wonderfully rounded. Brother Dylan, Friend Emma, and Dylan's dad are all bonus broken characters. The dialogue is particularly natural, I don't know if the actors ad-lib it or if it's strictly scripted but every line has a ring of honest believablity to it. I've just finished series 4 and it is heartbreakingly sad as it explains how Norman ends up like he is and what he does to get there, and as we head into the home straight to take it in line for the beginning of Hitchcock movie. I'm not sure if the original movie will seem a disappointment in light of the depth this series has given the characters. Bring on Series 5. I can hardly wait.",/review/rw4959158/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2013,nicholasdoran6612,10," Scary, Suspenseful, Good Acting, and Utterly Unsettling
","Now, I had my doubts, for Psycho was one of the best horror movies ever to be made, and making a prequel show could ruin it all. But, my doubts proved to be fortunately wrong. The story centers around young Norman Bates, who's just moved to a small Bay Area town with his mother Norma Bates. It is set in the modern world, so that's why I had to rack a point off, but who cares. It is absolutely amazing. Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore lead an all stellar cast into the world of serial murder, cover ups, and horrific betrayal that can only go so unimaginably high. With shocks and gasps, and the kind of suspense that makes you clench your teeth, Bates Motel is definitely a must watch. If you haven't see this show yet, go on to channel 46 and start watching because it will grip you, and it won't let go.",/review/rw4959158/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2019,wbamber-13759,9," Better ending than Game of Thrones
","Finally just finished Bates Motel, I was happily surprised by how good this hidden gem was. Very entertaining from start to finish, everything about it, setting, acting, visuals, and so on. Story was very compelling and kept you engrossed every single episode, the performances from the main two actors Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore were highly entertaining, they were brilliant and I couldn't imagine anyone pulling those two characters or Norman and Norma off better. The final season a lot of shocks oh my ""didn't see that coming"". All round great great show!! Sad it's over..",/review/rw4959158/?ref_=tt_urv

",Never expected this to be so good. Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore kill it as Norma and Norman Bates. With each season the series gets better and better. Even though we know the ending through the movies the series ends so great! I wish GOT's last season was even 10% as good as this! Hahahahaha,/review/rw4959158/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2020,ryancortero,8," Creepy and eerie, but worth the watch
","Bates Motel is a tv show based on the 1960 film, Psycho. I tried watching this before but found it a little uncomfortable. So I watched Psycho, which is one of my favourite films of all time now. I chose to go back and watch this show to see what a prequel in the modern world would be like. Looking back, there are some storylines that were unnecessary to characters' arcs or development. But it did go by fast with 5 seasons and 10 episodes each.",/review/rw4959158/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2013,BringBackFear,10," Creepy Show!
","Alfred Hitchcock (Psycho 1960) was a suspenseful and frightening film about Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and his dead Mother. The Bates Motel TV SHOW takes the story to a whole new level. It it is a prequel to the movie, about Norman Bates (Freddie Highmore) and his mother, Norma Louise Bates (Vera Farmiga). Freddie Highmore and Vera Farmiga give an excellent performance in their roles. There are many other added features to the show including characters that are connected to the Bates family. I would recommend watching this show if you haven't seen it yet. Please see it from the beginning. There are many new twists in the story. I believe any Alfred Hitchcock fan would be excited to see this show. If you are a horror fan, watch this upcoming season!",/review/rw4959158/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2021,Stevieboy666,9," Just completed Season One, totally hooked
","I have already reviewed episode one of Season One so I am not going to repeat too much of that, other than to say that I have thoroughly enjoyed every single episode of the first series of Bates Motel. Being a fan of the original Psycho (1960) but not one to bother very much with TV horror I thought I 'd give this a go and I was blown away! Brilliantly written and made, I enjoyed every single minute and look forward to catching the other seasons. Very highly recommended.",/review/rw4959158/?ref_=tt_urv

","a prequel who impose its rules. not in comfortable manner at the first sigh. but used in splendid manner. because it preserves the Hitchcockțs masterpiece mark innovating. and becoming a kind of bridge between different expectations of the viewer. it has a great script. an the perfect cast. Freddie Highmore is a real revelation . and Vera Farmiga is the incarnation of mun in brilliant manner. mystery, crime and thriller. and a story who is, in same measure, dark, cold, touching, fascinating. because it not gives answers but explores new and new possibilities. proposing a coherent world who escapes by white/black definitions.",/review/rw4959158/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm not sure the age range of the ""reviews"" written by a view of these people, but I must say they are way off about this show. I went into this series with high hopes. I knew Norma and Norman's relationship would be deeply explored, and that's what drew me in. I however was not expecting there to be so much intriguing mystery surrounding the little community they find themselves in. The casting is top notch, I honestly don't think they could have picked a better actress for Norma. ",/review/rw4959158/?ref_=tt_urv

This takes place in Oregon focusing on Norman Bates' (Highmore) early years as a teen and his complicated relationship with his mother, Norma (Farmiga).
