3 May 2021,ThomDerd,9," I don't like it, I love it.
",Great voice cast and a very good story makes this series a must if you are a fan of the superhero genre . I know this is from a comic dated around 2003 but i never read it and it doesn't matter. You can enjoy this without any prior info; its still pretty darn good.,/review/rw7119718/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2021,cjonesas,9," [8.9] Do teeth re-grow?!
","At last! (as one user pointed out too), an adult animation action series, encompassing full-length episodes with gut-wrenching animations, splashing blood & brain 360Â° and having you thinking about no other production but Invincible, till the last episode has been watched and finished!",/review/rw7119718/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2021,Bwent,10," hot damn.
","I think I'm gonna like this show. Violent, irreverent, entertaining. Seems like it will be able to hit all the same marks as ""the boys"" but without budget limitations. Which is awesome. And the star power of this show is incredible. Seriously look at that cast list. I'll definitely be eagerly awaiting new episodes.",/review/rw7119718/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2021,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,9," An awesome evolution for Superhero Animation.
","Invincible takes the classic Image Comics series and gives us the best mature animated superhero series since Spawn: The Animated Series. Considering both are Image properties, it's also no surprise that the violence in them is something that a Bruce-Timm-Batman cartoon wouldn't touch with a ten-foot poll, or Spider-Man toons even. However, the 'splashes' of humour and quippy dialogue IS something Invincible does honour and lean into when it comes to revering other superhero shows like Batman; this show takes something like the DCAU and decides to use it as a launchpad for Uber-violence and character-centric world-building focusing on sex and grey morality in a MARVEL-like universe.",/review/rw7119718/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2021,kthngm,9," What we needed in animated series
","Invincible really increases the standards in animated tv or web series by showing good character development, emotion, great ton of action and pg-18 violence which is kinda cool. Best thing is, every episode is 40 minutes instead of 20 ðŸ˜¬",/review/rw7119718/?ref_=tt_urv

9 June 2021,UniqueParticle,10," Amazing mix of The Boys, Sky High and any good cartoon!
","Mind blowing epic series that gets exceedingly better as it goes on! It's great that Robert Kirkman is involved he's perfect at sticking to the comics. I love the adult vibes, character development is spot on, color design is really nice, and the exciting feelings you'd get because it's about super heroes that kick ass.",/review/rw7119718/?ref_=tt_urv

3 May 2021,Movi3DO,9," Awesome Superhero Show
","Heard about this series from a friend. The first episode had a pretty similar feel to The Boys, but then it all changed at the end of the episode. This was a very gory and violent superhero series. This created a huge mystery that stayed in my mind as I continued to watch the show until the end.",/review/rw7119718/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2021,Clive_W,10," Awesome fun!!
","Hell to the yes, so far off to a very strong start, some nice changes to the source material (These aren't major changes more rearranging of events), I would recommend giving this a try, the animation is fantastic, an all star cast of actors, and an awesome eventful story, I look forward to seeing where the show will take us. And if you haven't read the source material maybe watching this will get you interested. Sit back and enjoy, just don't forget the popcorn!",/review/rw7119718/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," I enjoyed it!
","So far, Invincible has been everything I expected and more. I never read the comics so I was exactly sure what to expect but from reading up on it and watching the trailer I knew it's the type of show I usually like so I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm glad I did bc so far it's pretty good! The voice over cast has to be one of, if not the best, of any series ever! It almost has the star power of a animated movie.",/review/rw7119718/?ref_=tt_urv

","A flawless piece of animated entertainment. The final was brutal to the point of breaking me, and the journey was worth every second. Truly amazing.",/review/rw7119718/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2021,killedgrilledandfried,8," Good lord, this is intense!
","I am completely unfamiliar with the comics this is based on and I don't really care unless they leave the story unfinished, so I can't say anything about how well it adheres to the source material but I do know this: You gotta watch this show!",/review/rw7119718/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2022,Tweekums,9," This might look like a children's superhero cartoon but it isn't!
","Mark Greyson appears to be an ordinary high school student; if anything he is a little weak, getting beaten up after trying to stand up for a girl. What nobody around him knows is that his father is Omni-Man, the world's most powerful superhero, and that Mark should gain the same powers very shortly. This happens in the first episode and he sets about finding a superhero identity and learning how to use his skills. He ends up working with a group of junior superheroes who find themselves promoted to the big leagues when the premier superhero team is eliminated in an attack. The identity of the killer isn't hidden from the viewer but the authorities, who have their suspicions can't act yet. As the series progresses Mark develops his skills and helps take on various villains; he also befriends fellow superhero Atom Eve who helps him get closer to schoolmate Amber Bennett... will he be able to balance his new superhero responsibilities with a developing relationship?",/review/rw7119718/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2021,JTReviewsPlus,9," JLA Meets The Boys And Then Some
","Prime Video's (and Robert Kirkman's) Invincible adds another interesting take to the popular superhero genre. Filling the void of The Boys this year, Invincible is: mature, action-packed, visually stunning, charmingly written, perfectly acted, and so much more. I admittedly haven't read the comics but I was always aware of them and from my understanding, the show so far is staying true to the source material which is amazing. I love the world the creators setup, the heroes are oddly familiar in terms of looks and powers yet they are strangely different at times. It's extremely reminiscent of The Boys in that sense. The characters are heroic, funny, and transparent with one another (for the most part) similar to the Justice League animated series. While Invincible contains some superhero tropes, it's done on purpose and there's always something interesting happening thanks to the strong writing and perfect cast. I cannot wait to see what happens next. Suffice to say it'll be very hard for me to wait so I may just read the comics too!",/review/rw7119718/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2021,bradleycarrington,8," Compelling story with great action, but not without it's flaws.
","I just binged the first season of invincible and loved it. It felt like being a kid again and watching my favorite super hero cartoon since it's basically the same thing but with adult themes. I will say the first episode is very slow and feels like a cheap DC knockoff. I feel like they did that
purposely just so they could show the twist at the end and give us that feeling of ""just kidding, it's not what you expected"". But the first 40 min were so bland that I almost stopped watching. Also, even though this has more of a game of thrones vibe, where you never know if a character will live past the scene, there is still no shortage of plot armor and plot holes. Some characters will be strong enough to destroy a planet without breaking a sweat, but then find themselves struggling in a fight against something that is brought down relatively easily. And then vice versa some weak characters manage to survive when their stronger counterparts are brutally killed.",/review/rw7119718/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2021,mhorg2018,8," Not Marvel or DC - Crazy original!
","A great adaptation of Kirkman's comic, which, like the Walking Dead - he ended. Probably because he ran out of ideas - how often can the main hero be beaten nearly to death and recover? Well, that's that. Honestly, I like the show even more than the comic. Kirkman is a bit verbose and tends to cram a lot of words into panels. The animated show avoids that while keeping the story pretty intact. The voice cast (several from The Walking Dead and Killing Eve, as well as the absolutely phenomenal 'Does he Ever Rest?"" J. K. Simmons) are superb. The action is NOT FOR THE KIDDIES. This is not your daddy's superhero show. I'm really hoping amazon gives it a full run to finish the entire story. This makes up for their atrocious adaptation of Without Remorse.",/review/rw7119718/?ref_=tt_urv

","Invincible is an adaptation from the Image comics, that tells the coming of age story of Mark Grayson and his family in a world full of super people and tries to have another take at the super hero genre, by imbuing it full of drama, action and adventure.",/review/rw7119718/?ref_=tt_urv

13 July 2021,pinoandres,8," Amber, the only reason for the 9
","There is no way you see this series and not loving it if you like superheroes. Well writen, great villan, amazing characters. BUT there is one character that basiclly screw a perfect series, Amber the love interest. No character arc, no flaws, and if you havent seen the show you will get to see a gigantic hole in her logic near the end of the series. It would not matter if it was a minor character or a small insignificant moment but this is one of the ""pilars"" of the series.",/review/rw7119718/?ref_=tt_urv
