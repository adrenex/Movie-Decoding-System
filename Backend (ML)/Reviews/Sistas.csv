8 November 2016,bob-the-movie-man,6," OK... just OK
","I'm a big fan of Tom Cruise. He is a real old-fashioned film star, generous with his fans on the red carpet and with real star power at the box office. And I can happily sit down in front of just about any one of his DVD's time and time again and still enjoy it. Unlike many critics, I even enjoyed his last outing as Jack Reacher.",/review/rw3565241/?ref_=tt_urv

31 May 2017,lesleyharris30,4," A Dull, Dreary Let Down,
","Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is a lackluster movie with a poorly developed plot, despite a stellar cast. The performances is what saved this movie from becoming a complete dud. Tom Cruise is in great a form as ever as the title character, his natural charisma and energy on screen is evident throughout. Cruise always has great chemistry with his love interest Cobie Smulders, albeit not as strong an actress on screen, she fits in to her role nicely. ",/review/rw3565241/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2020,Boristhemoggy,4," Sadly this film isn't a Jack Reacher film
","I have been a Jack Reacher fan since book 1 and have every one written. I know intimately who Jack Reacher is just as many of his fans do. And Jack Reacher is not on this film, and this film is not about Jack Reacher.
Make no mistake this film is about Tom Cruise and no-one else. Every mannerism he has, his trademark way of running in every movie he makes. The stunts he loves to do which make it non realistic. The focus is on him, Tom Cruise all of the time and not on the character of Jack Reacher.
As a standalone action film it was OK but just OK, there are much better films out there at the moment. Extraction absolutely overwhelms Never Go Back for sheer entertainment and action and great acting and direction.
One day they will find a Jack Reacher worthy of the name, possibly someone like Thomas Jane, or Dave Bautista. But after 4 years of denying this movie I finally gave in to pressure from friends and watched it and the disappointment is palpable.
A very sad day for movies.",/review/rw3565241/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2016,TheLittleSongbird,5," Routine sequel to an enjoyable film
","While far from flawless (with an uneven script, an anaemic and anti-climactic ending, a few too padded out moments and Rosamund Pike, an actress who impresses me usually, giving one of her worst performances in a disastrously indecisively written role) the first 'Jack Reacher' has a lot of great things still and judging it as a standalone is very enjoyable.",/review/rw3565241/?ref_=tt_urv

",She ruined the movie. Typical BS from a naggy teenage girl... would have been 100x better without her. No explanation as to where they got his name for her mom to file a paternity suit with the government!,/review/rw3565241/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2017,eddie_baggins,3," Jack Reacher shouldn't have come back
","A usually charismatic presence that gives his all no matter the cause, I truly can't recall a time when I've seen acting superstar Tom Cruise looking as bored and tired as he does here, in the sequel nobody asked for and one you wish you never went back for, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back.",/review/rw3565241/?ref_=tt_urv

","Former military investigator Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) takes down a smuggling ring run by the local sheriff with the help of his successor Major Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders). He goes to DC to meet her for the first time only to be told that she has been detained for treason. She had sent two investigators to Afganistan who were mysteriously killed. Her military lawyer is killed and Reacher is framed for it. While in detention, Reacher saves Turner from assassins and they escape. Meanwhile, a paternity claim against him has been filed by Candice Dayton for 15-year-old daughter Samantha whom he never met.",/review/rw3565241/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2016,admtech69,6," Not an improvement over the original
","While the trailer gives too many of the best scenes away (as do seemingly most Hollywood trailers of late), the second entry in the Jack Reacher franchise fails in it's attempt to capitalize on the momentum of the original. ",/review/rw3565241/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2016,Vondaz,," Huge disappointment
","Having read all of the Reacher books, I was one of those who cried ""What??!!"" when Cruise was cast as Reacher, but I changed my tune when I saw the first Reacher movie. I thought Cruise carried it off well.",/review/rw3565241/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2017,Leofwine_draca,6," Not bad, but it could (and should) have been better
","JACK REACHER: NEVER GO BACK is the second of two Hollywood adaptations based on the books of Lee Child. The first film was a pretty decent thriller, not amazing, and this film is much the same. It starts off very well with a strong first hour but gradually descends into becoming average in the second half. The problem I had with it is that Reacher is saddled with the stereotypically annoying/sentimental teenage girl, who constantly does dumb things in order to further the storyline. Otherwise, it's the typical conspiracy business, bolstered by good suspense and action bits, as Reacher takes down opponents in fleeting moments reminiscent of BOURNE. Cruise delivers an acceptable level of intensity in the lead and the direction from the assured Edward Zwick is fine, so it's just a pity that the story flags at times with bloated character work and too much 'hanging around' when it should be moving forward at all times.",/review/rw3565241/?ref_=tt_urv

25 October 2016,Figgy66-915-598470,6," Tom Cruise struts his stuff again
","25 October 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester This Afternoon - Jack Reacher Never Go Back. Tom Cruise returns in the title role and plays the hero part with aplomb. The film begins, continues and ends with action and intrigue. In this outing Reacher has to uncover a government conspiracy to clear his name and that of a colleague. A complicated plot entwines itself around the characters and it takes a little concentration not to get lost. There is however a rather refreshing chase scene that doesn't involve a single car. Highly watchable but not as good as the first film. Always easy to watch Tom Cruise when he's strutting his stuff, whatever the plot.",/review/rw3565241/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2016,paulcf-510-910462,1," Please don't ruin any more Lee Child novels!
","The first JR movie was acceptable. This one, terrible! It opens with 4 guys beaten and laying in a parking lot. JR is inside a diner. We don't know what exactly happened or why it happened. But of course JR is responsible. Not even sure why this scene was there. It serves absolutely no purpose or story enhancement.",/review/rw3565241/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2016,The-Sarkologist,7," More action, less mystery
","I guess it had been a while since I had been to the cinema and this film looked pretty mindless so I decided that I would spend my Friday night basically watching Tom Cruise run around beating people up (which is what he seems to do best, not that he is actually one of those fisticuffs type of characters, though he is in this one). Actually, come to think of it this movie sort of reminded me of that Liam Neeson 'I will find you and I will kill you' movie (I know the name but I can't quite think of it right now). Anyway, as I mentioned it is basically a fisticuffs action movie with Cruise running around being some sort of ex-military cop trying to bust open some military conspiracy and saving the day. Actually, it is based on a book so I suspected that it was going to be heavier on the mystery than the action.",/review/rw3565241/?ref_=tt_urv

20 October 2016,phd_travel,8," Enjoyable and exciting with likable sidekicks
","The good thing about Tom Cruise action movies is the violence isn't gratuitous, the action is exciting and he isn't afraid to share the limelight with his costars. I like his costars here Cobie Smulders is a convincing Major who gets framed by some military contractor arms dealer (the villains du jour). Plus there is a likable brat possible daughter and the 3 together are a cute team. The villain is played by Patrick Heusinger - don't get why he has got it in for Jack so much. The action moves from DC to New Orleans. Tom still can pull off the action convincingly enough.",/review/rw3565241/?ref_=tt_urv

28 July 2021,RonellSowes,3," Never Going Back To Watch
","The first Jack Reacher film wasn't that great a movie, but it had a decently clever plot and was executed proffesionaly; Jack Reacher:Never Go Back doesn't even manage to meet these modest standards. Its story muddled and uninteresting and the way it navigates through is even worse. A series of mindless action and fight sequences wrapped together with some repugnant characters and dialouge that's meant to sound cool only it's anything but.",/review/rw3565241/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2016,elenaphysics,3," What a waste of time
","The movie was not so bad itself. A simple plot about a hero ,framed, wanted, trying to do the right thing and save the people he loves. BUT this should not even be a movie coming up in theaters. It is a b-movie. No plot, tiring, the same scenario repeated again and again. No real action, nothing thrilling. NO reason to spend your money and time. Watching any kind of TV series would be far more interesting. The plot was simple and obvious. It is nice though to see Tom Cruise acting again. But I had higher expectations and I was really disappointed. I expected a real movie and all I got it was this 80's style action b movie. So typical,so boring, I do not understand why people liked it.",/review/rw3565241/?ref_=tt_urv
