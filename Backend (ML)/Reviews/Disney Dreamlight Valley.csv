29 November 2018,nogodnomasters,5," THIS IS FOR MARY
","The original was a horror film favorite when it first came in the 70's out for two reasons. One was the infamous sliding trombone scene where he kills a girl with her own instrument. This film shows pieces of that scene and then goes on to do a bad recreation/tribute. The second aspect that we loved was the fact Dawn Wells (sweet Mary Ann from ""Gilligan's Island"") was in a horror film, a woman we had all grown up loving as the girl next door. She was the Marsha Brady of the previous generation. Addison Timlin is not my Dawn Wells.",/review/rw5057566/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2014,sanjidparvez,7," An interesting REQUEL!!
","The original TTTDS was one of the earliest slasher films in the genre that even came before (in 1976) popular franchises like Halloween & Friday the 13th and I've always been a fan of that flick for its humor, suspense & docu-drama like narration style & last but not the least the haunting ending. So when I first heard about there will be a new TTTDS, I thought it'd be another pointless, some cash-in effort but last night after watching this new take on T3DS, I'd like to admit...I was pleasantly surprised!!",/review/rw5057566/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2014,HumanoidOfFlesh,7," Phantom Killer strikes again.
","The original true crime slasher flick ""Town That Dreaded Sundown""(1976) directed by Charles B.Pierce was based on true story of a mysterious serial killer called the Phantom Killer,who during spring of 1946 killed five people and wounded three in a small border town of Texarkana.The perpetrator of these heinous crimes was never caught.The new ""Town That Dreaded Sundown"" remake plays more like ""Scream"" influenced modern teen slasher flick with plenty of references to the original movie and the Phantom Killer unsolved case.Addison Timlin plays teenage girl who after seeing her would-be boyfriend brutally murdered by masked maniac decides to find who really the Phantom Killer AD 2014 is.The movie-within-a-movie premise is certainly well-played and there are some gruesomely bloody kill scenes.Frozen in time Texarkana is also a nice touch.Unfortunately the final reveal of the killer is disappinting.7 trombone deaths out of 10.",/review/rw5057566/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2014,utgard14,3," ""Maybe we could jerk off together?""
","The 1976 movie this is a 'sort of' remake of was a quirky, fun, low-budget horror film made by Charles B. Pierce. I realize it's not going to be to everybody's tastes but I'm a fan of it. I don't say that like the makers of this movie do. I actually mean it. They obviously don't mean it since they spend most of this insulting the people involved with the original film as well as the people of Texarkana, where the real events the original film was based on took place. At the point where they introduce a loser character based on real person (and son of the director of the '76 movie) Charles Pierce, Jr., I almost turned the movie off in disgust. I can't stand cheap stuff like that. If you don't have respect for the first movie or the people involved with it, screw you for exploiting that film to make a few bucks, you talentless hacks. Love all the random artsy camera angles, by the way. That doesn't scream ""recent film school graduate"" at all.",/review/rw5057566/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2015,chaos-rampant,," Self-referential swing and miss
","Two things they attempted here, one is the usual slasher where a skulking presence moves about in the small town after dark, haunting the whole of space. It offers up the blood sacrifice the genre demands, the Texan locations are nice, a sparse setting for the knife to slash.",/review/rw5057566/?ref_=tt_urv

17 July 2015,dfa120374,3," Unoriginal, Boring, And A Complete Waste Of Time
","The first word out of my mouth to my wife after watching this film was ""lame"" as that is exactly what this film is, not to mention boring, unoriginal, devoid of atmosphere, believability (even for a slasher film), and - in part - cheesy. Some of the dialogue was pretty cringeworthy as well (the gay scene and the ""call me Lone Wolf"" speech just to name two) so add that that into the mix with the other descriptions and you have yourself a lame film. Exactly what I said it was.",/review/rw5057566/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2021,injury-65447,2," Rushed and Ludicrous
","I was kinda enjoying it up to the ending. Maybe a 5/10 at best. However, the ""twist"" ending is so dumb, pointless and unnecessary that I just fast forwarded to the end. Garbage ending on a mediocre film.",/review/rw5057566/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2014,Red_Identity,," Wish it was better
","There are some scenes here that are truly awesome and really entertaining. Despite the clichés, some of the death kills and chases are well done and pretty inventive (although having not seen the original, not sure how inventive after all). The acting is decent, and it really feels like an old-school slasher, for obvious reasons. The problem is that it tries to get into the backstory a little too much, ultimately deflating so much of its momentum. Its first act is definitely its strongest, what a shame it couldn't sustain itself. For horror fans, it's somewhat decent and maybe many will love it. But it does show some talent from Gomez-Rejon, who has proved to be the best director of American Horror Story",/review/rw5057566/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2015,jtindahouse,4," Needed a bit more love in the editing room
","A remake of a film that acknowledges the original's existence (and even implies it what an insensitive film to make) - now there's an interesting idea. Or at least a bold idea. It's not the first film to have done it, I know 'The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)' in 2011 played around with the same concept and I'm certain it would have been done before that. For some reason though it just leaves a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. It's like a different form of breaking the fourth wall. If you acknowledge the existence of film inside a film that's fine, it obviously happens all the time. But to directly acknowledge the series of films you are currently making just cheapens the whole experience and makes me wonder why I should care. To be fair though the film itself didn't really make me care anyway.",/review/rw5057566/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2015,Bribaba,8," Slasher With a Difference
","Post-modern take on the 1976 film of the same title, which was based on a series of murders that occurred in Texarkana on the Texas/Arkansas border a few decades earlier. The first film is frequently referenced but setting the story aside, the two have little in common. The original could sit comfortably in the video nasty genre, while the 'remake' is a stylistic tour-De-force with sound and photography that give off an art film vibe. The acting is solid in part thanks to veteran character actors Ed Lauter Gary Cole (the arms expert in The Good Wife). Although using a few genre tropes, this is not your average slasher flick. It's a scary movie but not a Scary Movie.",/review/rw5057566/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2019,keelhaul-80856,5," Different, but mediocre, with the crappy ending that plagues so many horror flicks
","This film is far from the worst horror entry I've seen, and it is one of the more unique films in recent years. It has some twists and turns, and the killer is genuinely scary in the vein of Son of Sam or the Zodiac.",/review/rw5057566/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2014,StevePulaski,8," An unexpected horror film that became a low-key winner
","The original 1976 ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" ranks as one of my favorite crime-dramas and horror films for its brilliant use of docudrama-style narration and editing, as well as its completely terrifying portrayal of an innocent town rocked by inconsistent and senseless murders, sending residents into a panic. In addition, the film combines my obscure interest of murders and murderers and fuels them into a film that works well under many different genres. The film profiled the mysterious murders by someone known only as ""The Phantom Killer,"" who, for three solid months in 1946, terrorized the town of Texarkana, right on the border of Texas and Arkansas, committing gruesome murders or vicious attacks on the backroads of ""lovers lanes."" To this day, ""The Phantom's"" identity has never been confirmed and many believed that he walked the streets of Texarkana until his assumed death.",/review/rw5057566/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Town That Dreaded Sundown (2014) is a meta-sequel to the 1976 film of the same name. Although I'm a big fan of Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa's writting skills, this film is a big disappointment mostly because of his ludicrous and awful screenplay.",/review/rw5057566/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2019,helencatherinetaylor,3," Hmmmm, not sure what all the good reviews are about
","If you loved the original then I guess this is for you on some weird nostalgic level.
Personally for me the whole thing felt like some terrible TV movie. The trombone scene was ridiculous.
I don't think this is going to win any new fans and I feel like the people that gave this a high score are trying a little bit too hard.
Heed my words or waste 90 minutes of your life finding out for yourself.

The 'Texas Ranger' was a slap in the face of Chuck Norris. This guy is arrogant, caustic, and unfriendly. He even steals Chuck Norris' handle, 'Lone Wolf' (From Lone Wolfe Mcquade). hollywood's portrayal of adults as stupid continues as a high school girl 'investigates' and out-thinks and outsmarts the adult investigators. hollywood's anti-Christian bigotry is rampantly represented in this movie and is inexcusable!",/review/rw5057566/?ref_=tt_urv
