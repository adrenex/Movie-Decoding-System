16 November 2013,drjgardner,9," WW 2 from a child's perspective
","Those familiar with the 2005 award winning and best-selling novel by Australian author Markus Zusak will not be disappointed with the theatrical version which differs from the book in only minor details. Both tell the story of a preadolescent girl who is adopted into a German family living in a small village in 1938, and then by following her life we get to view war on the home front for Germany. Nazi rallies, anti-Jewish pogroms, Hitler Youth groups, conscription, book burning, daylight bombing, propaganda films and posters, and the whole gamut of events are seen from her perspective.",/review/rw3004887/?ref_=tt_urv

","I do not know the book. But the film, for its beautiful simplicity is useful in high measure. A film about war and survive, well acted, touching and delicate, great for small details and for the atmosphere, reminding the art of admirable actors, proposing a magnificent trip inside yourself. Short, just delightful , with bitter taste and wise definition of the life meanings.",/review/rw3004887/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2014,shawneofthedead,7," The story loses some of its steam in migrating from page to screen, but it's still a powerful tale, relatively well-told.
","Many books have been deemed 'unfilmable' - but anyone who's read Markus Zusak's heartbreaking, thought-provoking The Book Thief would think it especially so. An often grim, unrelentingly dark and yet sadly uplifting novel about Nazi Germany in the throes of World War II - narrated by Death itself? Reviews for director Brian Percival's lush, snow-swept movie adaptation have not been kind, suggesting that the book would have been better left alone. It's true, of course, that Zusak's story and characters suffer somewhat in leaving the page. But the film and its titular book thief nevertheless possess a bittersweet charm, buoyed by a host of unforgettable supporting characters.",/review/rw3004887/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2013,mkramer-693-816493,10," Riveting, Thought-Provoking, and Powerful
","This is without a doubt one of the most riveting, thought-provoking, and utterly powerful movies for young people (or any people, for that matter). Unlike most movies for young people, which usually encourage selfishness, lust, and who knows what else, this is a film that promotes such qualities as self-sacrifice, courage in the face of unspeakable difficulties, and using your life to make a difference for others.",/review/rw3004887/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2013,rannynm,10," Gives a Youth Perspective of Surviving the Holocaust
","I bet you have seen many movies that have narration but I bet you  haven't seen one like this. In this movie, the narrator is Death.  The Book Thief is about a young girl whose brother dies and her mother  abandons her - all at the age of 11. She's adopted by an older couple  in Nazi Germany. Her foster father teaches her how to read which lights  a fire inside of her to read and read and read. Again, since this is  Nazi Germany, books are very hard to find. The only way she can get  more books is to ""borrow"" them. Also, her family agrees to hide a young  Jewish man in their basement which puts the young girl's family at  great risk. But, the young girl and the young man become very good  friends, helping each other through hard times. During this time, there  are many people dying so Death is very nearby and has a lot to say. The  Book Thief is all told from Death's perspective.  The lead characters are the young girl, Liesel Meminger played by up-  and-coming actress Sophie Nelisse and her foster father and mother  played by Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson. These characters try to live  a normal life while fighting for it.  One of my favorite scenes is when a friend of Liesel's, Rudy, goes to  the running track and covers himself in mud so he can look like Olympic  Track Star Jessie Owens. I like this scene because it shows how Rudy  didn't believe what Hitler was saying and supported Liesel and her  family.  The look and sound of this film helps convey the emotional story of  Liesel and her friends and family. The sets and costumes are all  beautiful and really portray 1940s Germany. The music is sad but also,  hopeful. The cinematography is beautiful and also lets us see the  harshness of their lives.  The message of this movie is ""to stand up for what you believe and  don't let a group of people tell you otherwise.""  I recommend this movie to ages 9 and up. Although this is a sweet  passionate film it does take place in Nazi Germany which includes  violence and death.  I give this movie five out of five stars because the idea of having the  narrator be Death really grabbed my attention and held my attention to  this unbelievable story to the very end.

10 December 2013,DUKEJBM,," A Flat Out Amazing and Emotional Instant Classic!
","This is a flat out amazing film. It's nuanced, extremely thoughtful and features some of the strongest performances of the year. If I had a vote, we'd get another young teenage girl nominated for ""best actress"" in a lead role for Sophie Nelisse's amazing work. Everyone's work here is award worthy. Sure, the subject matter may seem like a rehash (The Diary of Anne Frank""/""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas""/The Pianist"") but it really isn't. It's fresh, and packs the most emotional impact of any film that I've seen all year. Captivating and extremely powerful, the film is hauntingly beautiful. It moves at an effortless pace which allows the viewer to become immersed in the realities of Liesel's situation. That pace may not be for everyone but I found it to be perfect. Everything breaths properly and every connection made is heartfelt and meaningful. The literary vehicle of death as the narrator really is a masterstroke and works perfectly. It starts the film and finishes but is never intrusive. ",/review/rw3004887/?ref_=tt_urv

","Orange Wednesday's are a weekly escape from the monotony of the working world (New Teacher - Little money - Stressed - Used to do absolutely nothing at Uni). Therefore over the last couple of years, as you can imagine, the cinema has been overused and a plethora of films have been watched, reviewed and loved.

26 May 2014,claudio_carvalho,8," No One Lives Forever
","In 1938, the young girl Liesel Meminger (Sophie NÃ©lisse) is traveling by train with her mother and her younger brother when he dies. Her mother buries the boy in a cemetery by the tracks and Liesel picks up a book, ""The Gravediggers Handbook"", which was left on the grave of her brother and brings it with her. Liesel is delivered to a foster family in a small town and later she learns that her mother left her because she is a communist. Her stepmother, Rosa Hubermann (Emily Watson), is a rude but caring woman and her stepfather, Hans Hubermann (Geoffrey Rush), is a simple kind-hearted man. Liesel befriends her next door neighbor, the boy Rudy Steiner (Nico Liersch), and they go together to the school. When Hans discovers that Liesel cannot read, he teaches her using her book and Liesel becomes an obsessed reader. During a Nazi speech where the locals are forced to burn books in a bonfire, Liesel recovers one book for her and the Major's wife Ilsa Hermann (Barbara Auer) witnesses her action. Meanwhile Hans hides the Jewish Max Vandenburg (Ben Schnetzer), who is the son of a deceased friend that saved his life in the war, in the basement of his house and Liesel becomes his friend. One day, Rosa asks Liesel to deliver laundry to the Major and Ilsa invites Liesel to go to her library and tells that she can visit her to read whenever she wants. But in times of war there are many threats and the lives of Liesel, her family and friends will never be the same.",/review/rw3004887/?ref_=tt_urv

","If this film is not on most Top 10 Lists then what I think about critics will hold. As the saying goes "" I laughed, I cried, i felt good. This film shows hope in the face of the worst that life serves up, and wants you to come back for more. The acting from top to bottom was fantastic. Geoffrey Rush gives a wonderful performance that should get him an Oscar nomination. This is by no means a feel good movie, and I wouldn't bring younger kids to see it, but it will make them think about. Best of all look for the answer to the many questions this film should leave in their minds. Questions of did this happen, and if it did, WHY? I like that as in other films about this time, it focused on the ordinary people of Germany not just the victims of the Holocaust. How their lives were touched by the insanity of the masses and how some never lost sight of what it was to care about others.",/review/rw3004887/?ref_=tt_urv

For very young readers, it may not be the easiest book to start reading as the beginning chapters were rather mysteriously written, and the experience of any war may not be familiar.

Death stalks the skies muttering truisms about life and mortality. Decending through he clouds we see a steam train chuffing through a snowy European landscape. Decending through the train's smoke trail we enter the carriage and see Death claim his first victim of the film, all to John William's luscious (and Oscar nominated) score.
