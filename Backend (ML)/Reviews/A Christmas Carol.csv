22 January 2023,Sleepin_Dragon,7," A well paced, intriguing series.
","Alison and Sean seem to have the perfect life, newly married, living the perfect life, when Sean disappears at sea, Sean's family are quick to point that finger of blame on Alison, but is she the Cuckoo in the nest?",/review/rw8818480/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2022,per-181,2," Stay away from this soap
","This must be one of the very worst thriller series I have ever had the misfortune to watch. Amateurish writing combined with production values of a five-shows-a-week soap opera - no better than dreadful stuff like Hollyoaks or The Bold and the Beautfiul, with exaggerated characters delivering unlikely lines and unlikely reactions.",/review/rw8818480/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,jclark-84207,4," Poor script, wooden acting, predictable
","The idea behind Riptide, whilst hardly original, could have been something that might have been very interesting.",/review/rw8818480/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2022,leerosella777,3," Bad sound
","It might have been good, had the sound not been so poor! Music and sound effefts killed the dialogue, could only understand less than half spoken. It's not easy when you're hard of hearing and your hearing aids have to be turned down because the music is too high. Seems the norm these days, for all shows and films.",/review/rw8818480/?ref_=tt_urv

",I saw the reviews but thought I'd give it a try anyway. Quite enjoyed the first 2 episodes but lost patience after that.,/review/rw8818480/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,crumpytv,1," Sussed it our really early
","This is a contemporary drama and contains language and prevailing attitudes of the time, which some viewers may find offensive and downright irritating.",/review/rw8818480/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2023,rosemaryandthyme,3," Disappointing, Soapy and Wooden Acting
","I wanted so much to like this because I just adore Jo Joyner in Shakespeare & Hathaway and I was excited she would have a lead role in an Aussie series. Boy what a disappointment! Firstly it was s-l-o-w with long pauses and the dialogue was as if written for a daytime soap. Did the Neighbors scriptwriters and crew work on this in between series? As for Jo all I could see was a cheery Luella from S&H. Sadly, I don't think she had the range to show the emotion that was required for this role. Now the daughter...ugh.... too old for the role, stilted,
wooden acting and a whining Aussie accent. I cringed everytime she appeared, which was far too often. This series is a cringe-worthy snoozefest and very, very disappointing. Jo is a great comedy actress though.",/review/rw8818480/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2022,natnissim,1," What a load of rubbish
","Everything about this was bad, but mainly the storyline.",/review/rw8818480/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,simon1963,2," Channel 5 do it again!
","Congrats to Channel 5. I really admire their consistency of guaranteeing garbage drama without fail. In this Neighbours meets Eastenders yarn, the story is awful, the script terrible and the standard of acting laughable. You can tell the 'baddie' more or less straight away, as he keeps on pulling stupid faces. You can tell that Ali really means what she says, as with most utterings, she nods incessantly to emphasise her points. You can tell the northern bloke isn't really a baddie even if he has the shortest of all short fuses, etc, etc. The only reason I watched all episodes, was in the very faint hope that there would be a decent twist towards the end, but alas, no.",/review/rw8818480/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2023,Leeds1970,9," Great little Aussie thriller
","My husband and I watched this show after seeing it was from the director of Lie With Me, which we enjoyed last year. The first episode was the usual set up type hour and served up a bunch of suspects, but the twist was you don't have to wait until the very end to get the answers. Things take a sinister turn early in the piece and then it morphs into a different show, which sort of bucks the thriller trend. Minor criticism is that it was a bit jarring to see the British parents with a daughter who is clearly Australian, a couple of lines could've helped to explain it, hubby got very distracted by it I will say! All in all it was the perfect show to curl up with after Christmas even if it was a wooly scarves and jackets version rather than sunshine,",/review/rw8818480/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,lynn-simpson,4," The sound is awful
","I've just started watching this and have to keep reaching for the remote to turn the sound down when the music is playing in certain parts, then turn it up again to hear the conversation.",/review/rw8818480/?ref_=tt_urv

",Too many things is this piece of amateur soap opera don't add up.,/review/rw8818480/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2023,boycesimon,3," Too much build up and awful acting
","The premise of the series had potential (although it has been done many times before). However they spent 3 3/4 episodes building up to the ""reveal"" and the concluded the whole mini series in 10 mins.",/review/rw8818480/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,rosey-14,3," Appalling load of rubbish
","I watched this as it had Jo Joyner in, a very capable actress and seeing her something, which supposedly had more depth made it worth giving it a try but oh boy, it was a mess!",/review/rw8818480/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,delilahsamson-30372,3," Slow Neighbours drama
","I don't know how to use 600 characters to review this terrible mini series. The daughter was ok, although the actress must have been mid 20s, supposedly playing a 16 year old. They never explained why her parents had British accents, yet she was Australian or how her parents were actually allowed into Australia, mum a masseuse, dad ex-alcoholic. No disrespect to Jo Joyner, but are we meant to believe that Peter O'brien, Ciaran Griffiths and David Berry were madly in love with Jo's dowdy, dull and mumsy character? The murderer look like a male model! The music was obtrusive, 3 episodes to build up the story and 10 mins to wrap it up, very rushed. For me the star of the show was the beautiful house. Don't waste your time watching Riptide!",/review/rw8818480/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,bittysandbobs,3," Rubbish
","Okay... so I wasted my time watching all of this, really don't know why!! The volume is extremely bad, was constantly turning it up and down and up and down, I also missed half the dialogue as the speaking on it was so bad! Acting was poor which surprised me with Jo Joyner as she was great in Eastenders but this was such a predictable story line, boring, slow, bad acting, could have been a 2 parter rather than a stretched out 4 parts!! Felt very cheap, soapy like - home and away style programme. I gave this an overall 3/10 due to all aspects involved, the volume, script etc. Just very drawn out and boring.",/review/rw8818480/?ref_=tt_urv
