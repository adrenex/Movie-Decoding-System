9 October 2011,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,8," A timeless stop-motion/live action entertainment although not a masterpiece
","James and the Giant Peach is a stop motion/live action adaptation of the late Roald Dahl's book in the early 60s when being transitioned into film (like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The BFG, The Witches, Matilda, and The Fantastic Mr. Fox) about a young boy named James, who climbs into the peach and meets anthropomorphic stop-motion insects and stumbles upon an adventure of a lifetime. Many critics and fans of Roald Dahl alike were amazed about how faithful this movie was to the book, but there are two problems that I do have with this adaptation.",/review/rw5789572/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," A delightful adaptation of the book by Roald Dahl!
","True, it isn't as good as the book, which is a childhood favourite of mine, but it is still a delightful and charming film. The look of the film is splendid, with bright colours in most scenes and some very memorable scenes such as the killer sharks, and the peach was stupendous. The script is very clever and funny, especially with Centipede, who has some truly hilarious lines. The performances are exceptional, Paul Terry is very appealing as James and Pete Postelthwaite delights as the mysterious man, who is responsible for changing James's life forever. There is also a terrific voice cast, including Simon Callow, Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon and David Thewlis who breathe fresh air into the screenplay, but it is certainly Miriam Margoyles and Joanna Lumley as the ghastly aunts who steal the show. I do however have two complaints of the film. I did find Randy Newman's songs forgettable, and they occasionally mar the film's pacing, and Paul Terry's singing voice just was a bit weak. Other than that, it is a delightful film, with an 8/10. Bethany Cox",/review/rw5789572/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2020,planktonrules,8," More psychological trauma from Roald Dahl!
","""James and the Giant Peach"" is a neat film...one I enjoyed watching. However, I strongly recommend you think twice about letting younger kids watch it...or, perhaps you should watch it with them. Why? Because the film is pure nightmare fuel, thanks to a script by the master of childhood trauma, Roald Dahl! And, if you aren't sure, see the film yourself first and then judge whether or not it's appropriate for your kids.",/review/rw5789572/?ref_=tt_urv

10 July 1999,Meredith-7,8," The book is better, but a nice adaption
","As a child James and the Giant Peach was one of my favorite books, so it was interesting to see how it would be formatted into a film.  They actually did a pretty good job, although the book is much better.  The animation was nicely done, and I liked  the way the characters changed from life form to animated form- it gave the film a real surreal type of film.  The songs were quite poor, and were obviously aimed at the kids to 'liven' things up a bit, after all some may say the  story ventures on the dark side of things. It's nice to see a film aimed at children that can also appeal to adults as well, although it does help that many of us are very familiar with Roald Dahl's stories.  In summary quite a good effort.",/review/rw5789572/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2002,jangu,9," Utterly delightful and a must-see!!
","There is sooo much I like with this movie. It has imagination, a sense of wonder and characters you either love or hate. And the blend of live action and stop-motion animation is a delight. The songs incorporated in this story is not very memorable but sweet and fit their purpose. And you simply have to love to hate Margoyles and Lumley in their parts as the aunts from hell. They treat poor James so horribly that I thought that ""Cinderella had it easy""! Compared to ""nightmare before Christmas"" I actually liked this movie better. It has more of a heart even if the story itself may be just a bit less interesting and inventive. There are so many good scenes but among the highlights is the arctic adventure and the New York sequence. But, mind you, the opening is very deceptive and might scare younger parts of the audience. Otherwise, a must-see!!!",/review/rw5789572/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2012,Lomedin,5," Just OK
","I wanted to watch this movie for a while. There are not many around animated this way and I did love The Nightmare before Christmas and Coraline. So, I finally gave it a try. I was not particularly impressed. I found the story somehow bland and uninspiring. Also, any little moral message in it is basically lost in a number of events that I presume are supposed to be exciting but are rather dull. The songs are not really bad, although they don't save the film. Perhaps I'm just too old for this, although I still love other family films like the ones mentioned at the beginning. I find this film just OK, I wouldn't watch it again.",/review/rw5789572/?ref_=tt_urv

2 September 2004,simon-trek,," ""One of the greatest movies based on Roald Dahl's books""
",I was an enormous fan of Roald Dahl's books when I was kid. I think of him as the Hands Christian Anderson of the 20th century. I didn't read all of Dahl's books but I read most of them. I've also seen most of the movies based on his books. Out of all the Roald Dahl books I read as child I would say that 'Charlie And The Chocolate Factory' is my favorite but 'James And The Giant Peach' is my second favorite. ,/review/rw5789572/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2007,Sylviastel,8," A Great Film for Adult and Kids!
","I was a bit surprised that the film was not entirely animated. No, I did not read the book. The boy actor is fine here as is Joanna Lumley OBE and Miriam Margolyes OBE as his despicable aunts, Spiker and Sponge, who get custody of him as a child. They really are deliciously evil in their roles and they look like they are having a ball at it too. I thought the story was quite interesting with the animation and live action. The film is good for both adults and children as well as family can view it together. I thought the costumes of Spike and Sponge were hilarious. You could not tell that Spiker also plays half of Absolutely fabulous from this role. The make-up, the costumes, and visual effects are worth watching and it's good to watch this film.",/review/rw5789572/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2002,Dave Wilson,," A classic in my home
","I really enjoyed it, and so did my 3- and 5-year-old (and yes, we read the book). The animation and live-action scenes showed a lot of love. Though elements of the story seemed a bit hurried or neglected, they weren't anything a fairy-tale fantasy couldn't absorb in stride. The music works well enough for this non-fan of musicals, and I prefer serviceable and inoffensive tunes to the treacly jingles and melodramatic scores of the usual Disney classics.",/review/rw5789572/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2008,ferbs54,8," Peachy, Just Like The Book
","The 1996 Disney filmization of Roald Dahl's first book for children, 1961's ""James and the Giant Peach,"" is a delightful confection that, like its original, should prove as much fun for the adults as the kiddies. The film hews fairly closely to its source material, with some important differences, and really is quite the exemplar of modern-day animation arts. In it, we are introduced to James Henry Trotter, an orphaned boy whose miserable existence with his two witchlike aunts takes a decided turn for the better when a mysterious old man gives him a bagful of magical green crystals. These crystals cause the previously barren peach tree in his front yard to grow the titular giant fruit, and James soon meets, inside the stone of the fruit, six new friends, giants all: a grasshopper, a spider, an earthworm, a glowworm, a ladybug and a centipede (the book's silkworm character, for some reason, has been omitted). The seven make a hazardous trans-Atlantic journey to NYC aboard the peach, a journey that tests the mettle of each of the team indeed. The film differs from Dahl's book in that the journey to NYC is a goal, rather than a happy accident. The film also tones down the book's violence (James' aunts are not killed in the film), turns the shark into some kind of killer robot, and, most unwisely, drops the entire sequence with the Cloud Men in favor of a haunted pirate ship not at all present in Dahl's text. The nature of the rhino that ate James' parents is also, strangely, much altered. The filmmakers have added some musical numbers to the mix, and although Randy Newman's charms are usually lost on me, I found his five contributions here to be quite entertaining. The picture blends live action, stop-motion animation and what looks to be (in James' dream) animated collages seamlessly and effectively, and the whole production really is something of a technical marvel. Despite the changes, this is one very winning entertainment indeed.",/review/rw5789572/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2015,williambendavis-933-218958,8," Wonderfully creative and imaginative film
","What a creative and imaginative film, though it's really weird, so prepare yourself if you watch this. I was surprised by how much I actually liked this movie. I mean, I expected it to be good, maybe around a 6/10, but after watching it I'd probably give it a 8/10. The stop motion animation looks really awesome, especially for the time. What I think really makes it stand out though is just how wacky and creative it gets. It serves as an outlet for anything absurd and over the top, while being grounded by a simple story and simple, relatable characters. It does have issues though. There's this song at the beginning of the movie sung by the main kid actor, and I'm not going to lie, it sucked really bad. The kid just couldn't sing and I certainly could have gone without it. Also I don't like the ending. The way it ended left me believing that magic actually did exist in the movie's universe and I thought it would have been a better film if the kid had made it up all in his head to cope with the loss of his parents. Maybe that's a little dark, but it would have been really interesting for a kid's movie to have that underlying tone. Still, it's a pretty great film and it's perfect for the family (except my family, as they all hated it, yet they'll watch The Nut Job and laugh all the way through. Why?).",/review/rw5789572/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2005,slowbob,10," A Peach of a Picture
","James and the Giant Peach may not have the cult status of Nightmare Before Christmas, but, aside from mixing live-action bookends with the all-animated center of the film (not a great idea; should have been all-animation), it's a faithful and wonderful adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic dream-like story. The animation is superb, the voice talent wonderful (Susan Sarandon's sexy Eastern European Miss Spider takes the cake), and, as Time Magazine said, the film in many ways surpasses the book. Though there are flaws in the screen story by Karey Kirkpatrick, their effect on the overall emotional ride of the film is negligible. After seeing it again recently (first time in several years), I was amazed at what an incredibly beautiful film it is, beautiful colors and design and effects like teacup clouds and the cloud rhino. I especially loved the mechanical shark and the ships' arctic graveyard sequence where Centipede redeems himself by diving into the water to find a compass to get the peach back on course. Overall, a great film.",/review/rw5789572/?ref_=tt_urv

","The team of Henry Selick and Tim Burton (""The Nightmare Before Christmas"") was the right choice for adapting this Roald Dahl book, or any Roald Dahl book for that matter, to the screen. What Dahl needs is someone who can appreciate the dark and morbid humor to be found in his stories -- they DON'T need to be given the sanitized Disney treatment.",/review/rw5789572/?ref_=tt_urv

","I can't believe the high rating that the movie ""James and the Giant Peach"" received.  Obviously the people that rated it high have not read the book. Even so, looking at the film from the view of never having read the book, I still think this peach is rotten.  For anybody who hasn't read the Roald Dahl book, do it.  It is a wonderful story, and the movie pales beside it.",/review/rw5789572/?ref_=tt_urv

20 May 2012,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," A good adaptation from a classic children's book
","I remember when I was a kid and would slip in my Nightmare Before Christmas VHS tape, one of the trailers that was on it was James and the Giant Peach. I always wanted to see it, but my parents didn't buy the movie. I think because the film at the time had gotten Luke warm reviews, but over the years it seems like James and the Giant Peach got a cult following and an audience to boot. After all, we don't really get some of these great animated films that were from the 90's. Plus whenever there's a dark family film, a lot of parents tend to look down on it. I think today's parents have become a little too protective in my opinion. However, I had the opportunity to see the film yesterday and gladly watched it. I admit, my hopes were maybe a bit high, but I can see why the reviews were mixed on this one.",/review/rw5789572/?ref_=tt_urv
