",I saw this movie with my family a few years ago because of Depp and McGregor and we all ended up laughing the whole time and enjoying it. I'm not saying it's up for best picture or anything but it's certainly a movie you can pop in and get some laughs out of.,/review/rw3168298/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2015,namashi_1,6," Silly Fun!
","Adapted from the book anthology by the same name written by Kyril Bonfiglioli, 'Mortdecai' is silly fun! Though never hilarious, this recent box-office disappoint isn't entirely bad either. ",/review/rw3168298/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2015,kosmasp,7," Comedy - if you get it
","People have described it as a bit of Pink Panther thing. Which I guess will be OK for Johnny Depp. Because it's not far off and maybe the Captain Jack Sparrow comparisons will stop (probably not, but you can always hope can't you?). One thing is for sure, comedy is always something that will and can divide people easily. What some consider hilarious others will just dismiss as bad or annoying (or maybe something worse).",/review/rw3168298/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2020,travisbroy,10," The greatest comedy ever?
","Despite what reviews say, yes some Americans actually truly love this movie. It came out at a time when audiences were maybe kind of sick of Depp at the time and his reputation was being dragged through the mud, and the trailer sucked.",/review/rw3168298/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2015,DarkVulcan29,8," If Johnny Depp is having fun, then we should too.
","Mortdecai is one of those films that you'll love it or hate it. I really was entertained by it, the movie itself is a fun ride, it never tries to be anything more. Johnny Depp's funny performance is a cross between Cary Grant and Peter Sellers, like he does with the Pirate films, he milks it for all it's worth. Unlike his last two films, this was entertaining.",/review/rw3168298/?ref_=tt_urv

5 October 2016,lesleyharris30,7," Flamboyant Fun and that's all it needs to Be,
","Mortdecai is a good movie with a well written plot and a terrific comedic cast. The chemistry between the cast members is without a doubt what makes it so enjoyable for me. Johnny Depp, Paul Bettany, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ewan McGregor all have great individual chemistry with one another, I particularly liked how Depp and Bettany played off each other. They all fit in to this universe very naturally and effectively. ",/review/rw3168298/?ref_=tt_urv

11 September 2021,Weirdling_Wolf,8," A genuinely funny, amusingly ludicrous, Blake Edwards-style farce!
","Writer/Director David Koepp's bright n' breezy, screwball comedy is a consistently effervescing delight, greatly enlivened with one of Johnny Depp's most engagingly eccentric characters, the recently moustachioed, unrepentantly shady art dealer Charlie Mortdecai, a valiantly verbose, self-centred rogue whose adoration of his delightful wife is matched by a no less ardent dislike of policeman Ewan McGregor who all too reluctantly hires the magnificently foppish Mortdecai to assist him in locating a rare, recently stolen artwork, which is the initially sedate catalyst for a genuinely funny, frequently ludicrous Blake Edwards-style, high-octane farce, with the woefully inept, but eminently charming dilettante Mortdecai flamboyantly free-falling through a majestic multitude of pan-continental mishaps, fighting to keep hold of his beloved 'stach as his loyally twin-fisted, enthusiastically libidinous manservant Jock stoically battles with the myriad ill-humoured thugs and multitudinously evil menaces borne of his globe-galavanting master's misguided machinations, and woolly-headed, wonderfully wrong-footed chicanery! 'Mortdecai' is an impeccably acted, perfectly silly old school slapstick, pratfall-filled comedy with a nimble, whimsically witty script, likeable, colourfully rendered performances, all zestfully orchestrated by Koepp who credibly coaxes one of the more entertainingly squirrelly, sublimely screwball, knock-about kooky characters from the delightfully quixotic actor Johnny Depp.",/review/rw3168298/?ref_=tt_urv

8 April 2016,deloudelouvain,8," One of the better movies starring Johnny Depp
","I do understand that people don't have the same taste of movies etc. It's everyone's right to have a different opinion about anything. For me it is simple, the people that didn't like this movie are just people I try to avoid because of their lack of humor and taste. And they will probably try to avoid me as well. That's just how it is. Some people just don't have any good taste. To me giving Mortdecai a bad review is just ridiculous. I really enjoyed the posh sophisticated language of Mortdecai. I thought it was very funny. Johnny Depp was just the perfect actor for this role. He's just outstanding playing Mortdecai. The action might be a little bit over the top but that is just the only bad thing about this movie. And it's not even that bad. The whole cast was just perfect in this movie. To me Mortdecai is one of the better movies I saw this month, and I watch a lot of movies. I just feel sorry for people with no sense of humor, must be really boring living with them.",/review/rw3168298/?ref_=tt_urv

","Do you possess intelligence? If you do, this is your comedy. Johnny Depp is absolutely brilliant here. The rest of the cast accomplishes their task as well. The critics reviews were savage. This movie lost money at the box office. Ignore all that. The movie was over their heads. If you're stupid, and have no sense, please don't watch this movie. You won't get it.

30 January 2015,jeffpar52,8," Did I watch the same film?!
","I was moved to write my first ever IMDb review because of the amount of derision heaped on this film by mainly American reviewers. This mountain of vitriol almost stopped me from going to see the film; how glad I am that I stuck to my decision to see it! Johnny Depp, for me, is always good value, and is an actor who seems to be unafraid of challenging not only himself but we, the audience, too. His portrayal of Charlie Mortdecai was based not so much on Ralph Fiennes' M.Gustave, but more on characters from The Fast Show and various Upper Class Twits from the classic Monty Python sketch. Indeed, as a massive fan of The Fast Show (he appeared in the final episode) I'm fairly sure that Mr Depp had some influence in securing the comic genius of Paul Whitehouse to play Spinoza. After reading the host of bad reviews I entered the cinema with some trepidation, but was rewarded with a well-written, smoothly-directed, fast-paced concoction which ticked plenty of boxes for me; I did start to wonder if I was watching the same film that some other reviewers watched. Perhaps the humour was just ""too English"" for some of our friends in the ""far colonies""! Please don't be put off by the large number of bad reviews; Mortdecai was well worth the price of entry!",/review/rw3168298/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2015,kate-alexandria,7," Hilarious; don't believe those hipsters and their high standards
","Seriously, I can't believe how upset people are with this movie; I couldn't even breathe anymore as I walked out of the theater after laughing a lot! Yeah the jokes are stupid, the acting is over-the-top, the story isn't that brilliant and there isn't any deep sh*t plot twist but really, who watches comedy and expect something that will make them contemplate about life??? In terms of entertainment, this movie certainly delivers... Unless of course you're a frigging hipster who can't appreciate any movie that doesn't f*ck your brains out. Come on, Birdman for instance received a lot of good feedback but it's not that funny -- it's just deep. And artsy. It seems the trend these days; if a movie's storyline is plain enough for the layman to understand, these know-it-all guys will say it's horrible, waste of time, blah blah...",/review/rw3168298/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2015,StevePulaski,2," The deplorable Budapest hotel
","Johnny Depp has long predicated his acting career off of doing his own thing and not particularly caring what audiences or the general consensus of his performances or mannerisms are. Ever since the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise, Depp has continuously been giving headlining roles in projects with enormous budgets that have either barely broke even, went on to be record box office bombs, or simply withered away without anything of a pop culture impact. His last few films, ""The Rum Diary,"" ""Dark Shadows,"" ""The Lone Ranger,"" and ""Transcendence"" all have put up meager numbers at the box office when compared to their respective budgets, but, for whatever reason, financiers and movie studios still funnel money towards Depp's films, with or without any franchise history.",/review/rw3168298/?ref_=tt_urv

10 May 2015,diokokk21,8," Much laughs in a movie that doesn't hesitate to parody itself
","No one said that this movie was aiming for anything else than having a good time watching it.My guess is that everybody that disliked the film never liked Inspector Clouseau for example, or Indiana Jones movies. It is fairly obvious that Clouseau and Kato are Mortdecai & Joki in this one, minus Clouseau's unshakeable trust to his police force skills.Lord Charlie never gets as cocky in front of his ""team"" of spouse and male servant, for nothing more than his good taste and hideous moustache that surely reminds us of his noble background and also provides some good laughs. It is his ""pipe and hat"", or ""whip and hat"", if you prefer, his trademark appearance set. It is fairly obvious that the screenwriters and director tried to reference the opening scene with Temple Of Doom. Lord Mortdecai is a kind of Indiana Jones in the art business, finding lost paintings e.t.c., minus the naive US perspective of a morally right hero. He is a British Lord after all, thus corrupted, pompous and easily sold out to the highest bidder, due to personal debts created by the excesses of luxury and pretentious/decandant aristocratic way of life. Anyway, enough with the U.S. haters, that simply don't get it. In order of an American getting it, the dialogues should have been filled with gangsta rap slang..Then and only then, the joke would be obvious. Now, with this posh dialect and witty selections of words (like using a thesaurus) they should try to understand what's been said, than just laugh with the out-of-context, expressions such as ""yeah"", ""biatch"", ""sista"". African Americans are still used by/for white ignorance and it seems that it is fairly impossible for Americans to get anything funny that isn't in their cultural status, even if this foreign cultural element rather aims to ridicule itself, than seriously impose on any other culture. Americans must felt offended by Charlie's visit in the US or from quotes like: ""have we taken a wrong turn and arrived to a set of a pornographic film?"", while they were checking in a hotel, because I just can't otherwise understand their dislike to this film. It seems that Quentin alone can't persuade the American audience of the virtues of well written dialogues with unusual vocabulary choices. Now tell me, which is more preferable: ""son of a wh..re"" or Charlie's line addressing one of his abusers: ""your mother and father only met once and money changed hands..propably less than a 20"".. David Coepp is a successful screenplay writer, and a fair director, his all star cast performs the way they should be, and are at points hilarious, the plot is fairly twisting... I just can't understand why Depp is not as good as Sparrow, or Paltrow not as good as Iron Man's Potts, or Mc Gregor not as good as Obi-Wan. You might say that only Bettany provides a performance lesser of what expected of him, but that should be rather credited to the screenplay, or the role itself, than his effort which is adequate. The soundtrack contains one of the coolest songs in a movie (Johanna feat. MIles Kane). It is simply one of the best movies for the start of 2015. In the universe of trendy sequels this movie could easily provide a franchise similar to Edward's Pink Panther for the new millenia, much more successful than the American reboot of the series (with the god Steve Martin). I wanted to rank it even higher but I considered this unfair to other movies that are interested in achieving something greater than two hours of fun.

","I love eccentric characters whether they are the silent Mr. Bean, the bumbling Inspector Clouseau or even the wealthy treasure hunter Scrooge McDuck. Like any good story about an outcast, they are deemed stranger then the rest of the world and tend to use that to their advantage to find a gold mine or crack the latest case in France. I too consider myself an eccentric with my oddball quirks and strange interests including amusement park history and animation.

6 July 2015,inkblot11,8," Marvelous Mortecai! Lets's all start a cult following to tell everyone this is a very fine flick
","In England, Charles Mortecai (Johnny Depp) lives in a lovely mansion with his gorgeous wife, Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow). An art expert, Mortecai is nevertheless very much in debt. Also, our Charlie has grown a moustache, which Johanna hates; it may cause a rift in their marriage bliss. Thus, when a high government official (Ewan MacGregor) comes calling, asking Mort to search for a missing Goya, Charlie accepts. There will be some money involved, naturally. But, alas, folks connected to the painting keep dropping dead. The lady who was restoring the painting has been found deceased, just as Charlie arrives. Then, Charlie's favorite mechanic may somehow be involved and he is bumped off, too. If not for Chuck's fantastic male servant, Jock (Paul Bettany) Mortecai himself would have been offed. As luck would have it, Jock is a martial arts expert and completely loyal to his employer. Soon, the trail leads to California, where a filthy rich gentleman (Jeff Goldblum) and his beautiful daughter (Olivia Munn) may have purchased the painting. Naturally, Mr. Big Bucks winds up dead as well. But, wait, perhaps there are more secrets to uncover and Johanna is suddenly back in Mort's corner. Can they crack the case and net some large sums at the same time? This darling movie flopped at the box office and its a tragedy it did. Why were critics so unkind to such a terrific, witty, clever, and funny flick? There is no answer. BUT, don't you skip it as it is now on DVD and available elsewhere. Depp is a colossal stitch in the title role, going for broke with a great performance. Paltrow, MacGregor, Goldblum, and especially Bettany, are also very wonderful. Then, too, the look of the movie is also stunning, with great sets, costumes, venues, and photography. Lastly, the erudite script and the lively direction make Mortecai an absolute winner. Let's start a cult following, Depp fans, or maybe even take out a change.org page. THIS MOVIE DESERVES NO LESS.",/review/rw3168298/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2015,bastille-852-731547,1," One of the worst movies I've ever seen!
","I just got back from seeing this and it's honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I knew it wasn't going to be brilliant, but I like Johnny Depp and thought it would be at least a fun, bumbling action-comedy, a genre that is a 'guilty pleasure' of mine. It's hard to decide where to start when pointing out the flaws of a dreadful movie like this, but I'll first start by saying that the writing is horrendous. The lazy writers decided to use the same jokes not once, not twice, but several times because they can't think of anything better to write! The line 'show me your balls' is used at least 3-5 times and while it was sort of funny the first time, it starts to get INCREDIBLY tedious and repetitive after that. The same goes with Mortdecai's wife gagging when they try to kiss. That happens 3-5 times as well and is even the final shot of the movie as well! The rest of the humor is mostly slapstick-based, which would have been fine if it wasn't so painfully obvious what was coming. For example, in one scene Mortdecai is sword fighting a man and he ends up on the ground with a large box suspended from a wire up above. The man takes the sword and cuts the rope and the box almost 'traps' Mortdecai. And in one ridiculous scene when the writers didn't know how to end it, people attending a party with food poisoned by the villain, despite being in plain view of the villain poisoning the food, eat it and vomit profusely, including onto a moving car's windshield. The remaining jokes are painfully dumb as well and are basically showcases of the complete stupidity of Mortdecai's character. For example, he walks into a hotel in Los Angeles and sees people in bikinis and claims that he accidentally went to the set of a porno. Then he checks in at the reception desk and gets handed a room key and claims that the U.S. is in financial troubles because anyone who checks in at a hotel receives a credit card like he supposedly just did. The story is really dull and never really comes together, and even worse, the so-called twist can be guessed miles away. Overall, ""Mortdecai"" is an embarrassingly bad comedy that tries to be funny, but the horrible quality of the movie is the real joke. One of the worst movies I've ever seen!",/review/rw3168298/?ref_=tt_urv
