21 June 2008,sillybilly21486,3," For a camp that supposed to rock no one can play instruments...
","I was very surprised at how bad they added the music to this movie. The scene by the water where he's singing to her with his acoustic where did the bass and background vocalists come from? Also the cast doesn't know how to lip sync to the songs, nor do they know how to play guitar (Peggy during her solo playing an E major almost the entire time up and down the neck of the guitar) and the strumming of the guitars never matched up to the music playing. The dancing sucked..one dancer looked like she was thirty. ",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2008,hellosunshine,2," Worst Disney Channel Movie Since Cheetah Girls 2
","I do not want to put too much spoilers in my summary so I will just summarize the horrible acting, singing, and awkward dancing involved in this horrible made for TV movie.",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2008,trillionare12,4," Not worth it
","I was excited to see the premiere of Camp Rock, because I figured that it would be a fun, music filled movie featuring the Jonas Brothers. But I was greatly disappointed.",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2008,shani_luvs_movies,5," Not worth all the hype...
","Although this was at times a cute movie (mainly because of the Jonas brothers), my friend and I found ourselves laughing at the movie more than laughing with it. Maybe it's because I'm no longer in the pre-teen age group the movie was suppose to reach out to and I was only watching it because nothing else was on, but I thought the plot was unoriginal and extremely predictable. Sure, the Jonas Brothers added to the musical value and it had a few great songs in the end but the sound editing made it sound like the performers were lipsynching(who knows,some might've been).",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2008,seniorrah08,2," Preditable Mess
","The only reason I am giving this movie a ""2"" is because of the singing. The voices were very good, but the actors were not. Predictable roles: disapproving daughter, outcast, two girls ruled over by one ""teenage drama queen"", the cute troubled boy, and of course, the poor parents who happen upon giving their daughter (who is the disapproving)the chance of a lifetime. Disney movies are not what they used to be. I grew up on the classics; Sleeping Beauty, Little Mermaid, Cinderella, Snow White, and Aladdin. I did watch High School Musical, and was impressed. The sequel was a disappointment, but to be honest I only watched it to see Zac Efron. (a bit shallow, i know). I did watch Camp Rock, only because it was sooo heavily advertised and I wanted to see what the big deal was. High School musical was incredible for a few reasons: Little known actors who could really act, incredible voices, although predictable it was well scripted, cute people (shallow again), and left the audience with a positive message. Camp Rock, while incredibly predictable : SPOILERS!!!!! AHEAD:",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2008,sugarwhitegirl1,3," Did you really think it was going to be good?
","I didn't thing ""Camp Rock"" was going to be that good, and was not planing on watching it, but the night it premiered there was nothing else on so I tooned in.",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2008,MelRocks,2," Will not be the next ""High school musical""
","I admit, they were probably trying really hard to make this movie liked by everyone, but it's just not that.",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2008,SugarCubes831,1," Hmmm
","Well... I expected this to be HSM redone and it was pretty close, but more different than I had originally thought. I figured I'd watch it, if it became HSM a quick flick of the channel could save me, but I managed to sit through the whole thing. I was also worried because Family realllyyyy hyped it up, they had done the same with The Latest Buzz which, in my opinion, is probably the worst show I've ever seen.",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2008,music232,2," Camp Rock Review
","I must admit, even though i'm not a big fan of Disney channel movies, I still look forward to them. Once the movie was finally over, I knew it was a disappointment.",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2020,quiqueperezsoler,6," Has things to say but they lie underneath a lot of cheesy dull acting. Great music and choreography though!
","I basically consider it a guilty pleasure as with High School Musical and the rest of Disney Channel Original Movies, I grew up with it. These definitely would be dispensable if not for having some themes and good messages for kids, teens and even young adults in some occasions. Although most of these repeat themselves a bit, themes like be who you are no matter what society expects or its norms, don't lie to your friends, don't opt for the easy way out or don't make the more money-oriented-but-hated decision.",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2008,short_dancer3,4," Disappointing...
","I recently watched ""Camp Rock"" quite frankly because I was bored and I like to keep the T.V. on when I read. I am out of the age range that Disney tries to appeal to (a.k.a. preteens) but I figured ""what the heck? let's try to get back in touch with the good old days"".",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2008,powerdragonmaster,1," Embarrassing
","This movie is an embarrassment to music. Every song in the movie was clearly lip synced. The voice in the songs didn't even come close to matching the characters' voices. From what I can tell, the characters are all terrible singers and know nothing about music. They sang their cheesy, repetitive, annoying songs in some studio, their voices were heavily edited to make them sound good, and the music was dubbed in. If Disney wants to do a musical, maybe they should find actors that actually know how to sing. Second of all, why did they call their little concert things ""jam sessions?"" A ""jam"" is where many talented musicians play together and simply improvise for a while. Everyone trades off solos, and it's not perfect. A jam is not a rehearsed event where everyone is doing a choreographed dance and pretending to play the guitar. Awful and embarrassing. As a musician, I find this absolutely atrocious. The only reason I watched the whole thing was because the girl is very pretty (don't worry, I'm a high schooler).",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2020,Thanos_Alfie,3," Boring...
","""Camp Rock"" is a Comedy - Family movie in which we watch a young girl going to a music camp where every gifted teen go. There a famous teen idol overhears her singing and starts searching for her. What he cannot even imagine is that the girls he is looking for is the one who works as a kitchen assistant.",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2008,ellabella0328,1," Camp Rock = Camp Lame
","WOW! And to think that I would've believed that an over-hyped movie would live up to its...well..hype. But apparently, I was wrong. Disney Channel's latest 'Original' Movie ""Camp Rock"" was just a bunch of overplayed characters, over-used themes, and Demi Lovato over doing that song ""this is me"". We get it, we get that ""this is me"" and that ""we rock"" but why is it you, or why do you, indeed, rock?",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2008,TOMNEL,2," Clichéd and boring.
","The problem with this movie is not the performances (Well it sort of is) or even the direction, but the terrible writing. It's billed as a Disney Channel Original Movie, but it doesn't feel like a movie. It feels like a bunch of clichéd scenes from other movies made into a Frankenstein-ish monster. This ""movie"" is a beast to sit through and the only reason it is so popular with little girls is because of the abundant amount of screen time for Joe Jonas.",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2008,wtf-seriously,3," Nice Try
","I decided to watch this when I was bored one night, being a 20 year old female college student I was obviously not the chief demographic, but I enjoyed High School Musical enough, so I thought I would give it a shot.",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2018,SnoopyStyle,6," let's not hate
","Mitchie Torres (Demi Lovato) is desperate to attend the prestigious Camp Rock. She is overjoyed when her mother gets a discount by working in the kitchen. She is befriended by Caitlyn Geller (Alyson Stoner) but she abandons her to be a follower of snooty selfish Tess (Meaghan Martin) who has a famous mother. Like everyone else, she falls for celebrity counselor Shane Gray (Joe Jonas) who is trying to rehab his damaged public reputation. He overhears her singing and falls for her without actually seeing her or knowing her identity. All the while, she is hiding her poor kitchen help background from all the other kids.",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2020,lisafordeay,7," Havent seen it in ages . Good
",Camp Rock was the film that introduced me to both Demi Lovato and The Jonas Bros. The film is about a teen girl named Mitchie (Lovato) who wants to join Camp Rock which is a camp where different musical groups are formed. Mitch later meets Shane Gray(Joe Jonas) who hears Mitchie singing This is Me and wants to find the person who sings this song. But will Mitchie's new friends like her for herself as her mom happens to be a chef at the camp.,/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2020,brookenichole-98054,8," Great!
","I have so many amazing memories from when I first watched this movie. So, every time I turn it on I feel happy. It's silly and has catchy music with some nice actors. It teaches an amazing lesson to never lie and change who you are. Overall, this movie is just what Disney is all about.",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2008,HollisterNights,6," Predictable Yet Entertaining
","Okay, DO NOT get me wrong. I love the Jonas Brothers and Demi Lovato to death but honestly, it feels like this film is missing something. I know this is supposed to be a Disney Movie and that it has been endlessly compared to High School Musical but I have to say that... High School Musical carries an element of magic that is missing from Camp Rock.",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2010,tomb_92,4," One giant rip-off, and it can't even do that properly
","I didn't exactly have the highest of expectations, which probably made the film slightly more bearable. The problem was that 15 minutes in I thought to myself that this could be alright. It seemed intelligent and fun at the same time, something that is difficult to get in a kids movie. How disappointed was I then, when it descended into clichéd nonsense, especially with the ""I was just trying to fit in and be popular but at the end of the day I've found out who I really am"" rubbish? It was just far too unoriginal, but if you're going to copy other plots from other films then you at least do a good job of it, this film really doesn't. The lead it to Miley Cyrus-esq, but just not as talented (as least that's the impression I got) and the girl opposite her playing the bad girl was too watered-down ""Mean Girls"". Young girls of about 7-12 might be interested, but otherwise stay clear. The whole thing is so High School Musical wanna-be, and just isn't",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2008,Lily-32,8," It grows on you, and not like an unwanted fungus
","First I want to rebut the assumption that if you loved HSM 2 then you'll love Camp Rock. Not so. True, HSM 2 didn't quite capture the same magic as the first one but I think it still had it's own magic.",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2010,Rectangular_businessman,1," Camp Boredom
","""Camp Rock"" is just another lame musical produced by Disney, in the same vein of the horrible film ""High School Musical"". While I love the animated films produced by Walt Disney, I can't stand most of the live action films produced by that company, mostly because almost all of them are filled with lame and unfunny jokes, bad soap-opera melodrama, corny moments and stupid and annoying characters. ""Camp Rock"" has all that. And that is why it is so bad. I hated this movie just as much as I hated ""High School Musical"". This movie is corny, dumb and boring and no one of the characters were likable or interesting.",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2008,jskellingtonpirate13,3," JoBros....why did you come into this?
","Okay, let me start by saying that I am a fourteen year old girl who loves the Jonas Brothers. I love them to death, me and my friends have arguments about which of us is gonna marry Joe or Nick (Sorry, Kevin...you're cool, just not our type.) and me and my one friend almost cried when we couldn't see it on Friday and had to resort to watching a taping. But...this was painful. I started groaning when I found out we still had an hour left to watch, and I'm writing this while watching it because I couldn't take anymore and needed something else to do.",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2008,departed07,6," Tries to excel High School Musical but doesn't come close.
","""Camp Rock"" is the latest addition of the Disney Channel Original Movies to hit the small screen where like the High School Musical films and The Cheetah Girls series, it's all about young people and music. There was so much hype from the Disney Channel along with every magazine publication from People Magazine, Entertainment Weekly, and all the teen magazines we read (J-14, Popstar, BOP) that once the actual event got here, it felt like a total bummer.",/review/rw1896980/?ref_=tt_urv
