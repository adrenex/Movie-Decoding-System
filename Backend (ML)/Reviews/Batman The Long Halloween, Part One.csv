6 September 2021,GabrielSymes,9," Unusal
","So many reviews here, posted after the first episode aired, are heavily criticising the programme because someone wore the wrong sort of hat. What next? Star Trek is awful because space monsters don't live on Mars?",/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2021,Too-Tall-for-the-Desert,7," Suspend your disbelief
","I come from Royal Navy heritage and find the way the RN are portrayed quite offensive. The story is utterly implausible and full of real life inaccuracies, but put all that aside and remember that this is a TV drama and not real life and it is actually a gripping show. I could write loads on the flaws (you never, ever call a Coxwain or Petty Officer 'Sir' for example), and I agree with the comments about BBC wokeness, but the actors are good, so I have no issues with their selection. So suspend your disbelief, sit back and enjoy a decent British drama.....",/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,ourelbi,8," Well, I liked it.....
","I have absolutely no interest in anything navy storyline related usually, and so skipped over this a few times but Suranne is great, so ..... I'm not sure what the other navy-crazed reviewers were hoping for but calm down - it's a TV show, not a documentary on the workings of the navy. Also, how many reviewers need to use the work ""woke""? Did people just learn that word? Move on - sit back and enjoy the show! :)",/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2021,Sleepin_Dragon,9," One of 2021's highlights.
","This is a thrilling six part series from The BBC, I've seen some hilarious comments about realism, it's very obvious that this is meant to thrill and entertain, not inform.",/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2021,mixterau,7," Definately fiction, but enjoyable
","As an amateur navy buff, there are too many mistakes to mention in regards to the on board submarine sets, & navy protocols & procedures.",/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2021,clairedoobie,8," It's a drama not a documentary
","I mean, if you want to know about life on a nuclear submarine watch a documentary. This is a drama and a gripping one, well acted IMHO.",/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2021,fallyhag,5," Every second is painful to watch
",Such painful lazy writing. More cliches than a bucket of cliches in a cliche shop. The cop with the troubled past. The soldiers with the rude defensive aggression. The bizarre slowly unravelling story. The coincidences. The painful narrating and sign posting of the story. The disconnection of reality. The pantomime characters. The copy and paste script piggy backing off 'A Few Good Men'.,/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2021,SplatDcat,5," Would've been better in 3 or 4 episodes
",The very loverly Rose Leslie did a stunning portrayal of a PC but Suranne Jones' performance was a real let down.,/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2021,harpyg,4," Started Well, But Faded
","I enjoyed the first few episodes but it failed to keep up the same level of excitement. Some parts of the plot were strained and over-thought, others not believable. The ending was a damp squib.",/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2021,ToneBalone60,4," Voyage to the bottom of the TV awards.
",So much is just plain wrong about this.,/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2021,Lejink,6," High Crimes in Low Places and Confined Spaces
","This 6-part BBC drama would have the viewer believe that the American and Russian submarines are forever playing cat and mouse in U. K. waters while our own subs unsurprisingly get to play the cheese in between them. It starts with a death on board the HMS Vigil of Martin Compston's mouthy comms officer which sees lone police officer Suranne Jones assigned to go on board and hunt down the killer. She needs on-shore help too and just as you would, naturally chooses her same-sex ex-lover on whom she's just walked out. But her hinterland doesn't stop there as we learn that she's recently survived a traumatic near-drowning in a car-crash which kills her hunky boy-friend, but in which she saves his cherubic daughter, which serves to bond the two together in a parenthood-by-proxy kind of manner.",/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2021,Ladiloque,3," Thrilling but mediocre
","Full of inconsistencies, ridicoulous writing, dialogues and acting. Some claim that even the procedural, military and technical aspects are full of mistakes: I'm not an expert but I find it likely.",/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,karinahatem,5," Not very solid
","Had a good start, but it lacked the suspense, got rather poor performance, and too many plot wholes that didn't add up. Furthermore, looks like the British are following in the foot steps of the American by must include a gay/lesbian couple, which was totally unnecessary !",/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2021,horst69,1," A bad story let down by a dismal screenplay
",Could writing get any worse ?,/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2021,boydpeters,5," Embarrassing. Cliche
",Episode 4. Barging into the control room.,/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2021,hond-92064,5," I missed the giant squid...
","There are so many cliched story strands weaved into this series (in a mostly clunky way), I was expecting the giant squid as well.",/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2022,skyhawk747,5," Started off ok...
","But sadly spiralled into a budgeted blue screen drama. Some flawed plot lines and as stated before, a pathetic attempt of political correctness by the officers being lesbian. It had no relevance to the storyline, if it had then no problem but it was obvious it was thrown.",/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2021,benntune,3," Laughably bad
","I don't know where to start. The writing is horrible. There was obviously no time taken to understand submariners let alone how a SSBN sub operates. I genuinely feel bad for anyone who works in the British navy as it paints them all as incompetent and volitile. And then there's the detective who wanders around the boat like she owns it, getting in the way of the crew doing thier job. She would be removed immediately in reality regardless of her job or at least confirned to quarters. This is a nuclear deterrent sub and she's wandering around like an idiot. This was just embarrassing.",/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2021,paul2001sw-1,9," Gripping entertainment
","Murder on a nuclear submarine is a form of locked room mystery that even Agatha Christie never came up with. The new BBC drama, 'Vigil', was made with the involvement of several of the people involved in 'Line of Duty' (including actor Marin Compston in a small role) and it's been produced with all the slick professionalsim you'd expect, keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat with the aid of a slightly overcooked storyline. Also as with 'Line of Duty', it's told in a compressed, efficient form: six thrilling episodes instead of an overlong epic. My only gripe is there isn't that much of a deeper point to the story: post cold-war, the Russian menace just isn't that compelling as the underlying driver of the plot. But unless you stop and think about it, it's such gripping entertainment that you don't really notice.",/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2021,MadamWarden,1," SINKING IN EXCREMENT
","Such utter trash. OMG. I may not be a submariner but even I can see that this story is beyond bad. So many ridiculous plot ""turns"", awful dialogue and amateur acting.",/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2021,elliotjeory,4," It wasn't good
","Very corny and stuffy British drama, not believable, very far fetched and very disappointing.",/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2021,mrmatthewadams,4," FIne if you like soap operas
","Everything about this is ""ok"". That is ""ok"" if you like to watch the sort of acting that is just about good enough for your average soap opera. The captain of the submarine has the on-screen presence of a junior car salesman in a dealership just outside a small regional town. Not exactly dynamic.",/review/rw7361564/?ref_=tt_urv
