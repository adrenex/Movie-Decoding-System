6 August 2010,Blueghost,," The Savagery of Religion
","I remember hearing of Hypatia's tragic tale from Carl Sagan in his ""Cosmos"" TV series way back in 1980. I was appalled by the tale, and shook my head as any good reasoned young man would. It was a story that stuck with me for much of my life. And I often wondered if such an important biography would ever be published about this mysterious and remarkable historic figure. I truly did not think so, and believed that Hypatia's memory would have to live on with what little history there was written about her, and the blurb mentioned once or twice by Carl Sagan as he recounted the once magnificent library of Alexandria.",/review/rw2128090/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2010,RResende,," metaphors, distances
","The great thing about this film is the choosing of the story, and its context. The shifting of mentalities depicted here and the riotous events, whether historically accurate or not serve as an example of what was going on. Basically the end of an age, that meant the placement of religion at the core of political, social, and cultural powering of society. So, it's pretty apt that they developed a story around the idea of christians overcoming jews and pagans, yes, but more important, forcing Orestes (the ""old school"" guy) to play their political game, and wiping out Hypatia, the ""last"" free thinker (and a woman!).",/review/rw2128090/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2021,symmachos,9," This is how to make a movie about ancient times
","As a well-crafted and historically accurate chronicle of Alexandria in late antiquity, this movie compares favorably with HBO's *Rome,* and it actually trumps *Rome* in its fidelity to fact. Without sentimentality or smarminess, without intrusive soundtrack music, we see the life and death of Hypatia, one of the greatest astronomers & mathematicians of the ancient world. The ever-lovely Rachel Weisz gives a thoughtful performance as the title character, and Max Minghella is very good as Davus, the brooding slave boy whose unrequited devotion remains as steady as the stars.",/review/rw2128090/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was familiar with the Hypatia story because a certain category of people in my native country choose to present here as a martyr from a bygone golden age of reason, rapidly receding before the encompassing waves of Cristian barbarity and obscurantism.

","a really engaging film looking at the clash of Christians & Pagans in 4th Century Roman AD. The loss of ancient knowledge and destruction by ignorant violent mobs Hypatia, a female mathematician, philosopher and astronomer in 4th century AD Roman Egypt - a most interesting historical character. & the important of tolerance and asking questions, the pursuit of knowledge. beautifully shot film as well, a window of a lost society.

9 April 2019,nogodnomasters,10," WONDERFUL HISTORICAL DRAMA
","If there was ever a such a thing as an atheist saint, Hypatia would be it. This movie is a dramatization of historical events. The city of Alexandria was a center for learning. It was said that the philosophical and religious discourse among the merchants and general population in the agora were on a very educated level, that which rivaled the scholars. With the onset of Christianity, the religious discussion changed. Religion was primarily based upon cosmic myths, most of which had lost their original meaning due to the Pythagorean concepts which fused with the old religion creating multiple paradoxes as to generate such debate. Is God anthropomorphic or is God light?",/review/rw2128090/?ref_=tt_urv

","This historical view of Christianity and the Roman gods in Egypt and issues with the Hebrews makes for exciting screen entertainment because it is one that has been overshadowed by bad Gladiator movies and a lot of films that barely told anything that was actually going on at the time. Admittedly, the general story is based on fiction but it gives you a good idea of the elements of what was going on at the time, and according to general research on the truth of the film, much of it is accurate. The leading character is a fascinating woman who actually existed, Hypatia of Alexandria (Rachel Weisz), a scientist with atheist beliefs who has students of all beliefs in her class, and several of them are in love with her.",/review/rw2128090/?ref_=tt_urv

20 May 2013,ma-cortes,7," Epic and historical drama about a famous female philosophy and astronomy professor called Hypatia of Alexandria
","Spectacular and lavish film well directed by successful filmmaker Alejandro Amenabar . Historical drama concerning a slave (Max Minghella) who turns to the rising tide of Christianity in the hopes of pursuing freedom while also falling in love with his master, the known female philosophy and mathematics professor Hypatia of Alexandria (Rachel Weisz) .The mathematician and philosopher Hypatia of Alexandria was the daughter of the mathematician Theon Alexandricus (Michael Lonsdale). She was educated at Athens. Around AD 400, she became head of the Platonist school at Alexandria where she imparted the knowledge of Plato and Aristotle to any student. The picture is set in Alexandria, 391 AD . There Hypatia teaches astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy. Her pupils included pagans, Christians , slaves (Max Minghella) and foreigners . As the city's Christians, led by Ammonius (Ashraf Barhom) and Cyril (Samir) , gain political and economic power . At the end Orestes (Oscar Isaac), the governor of Alexandria, and Cyril (Sami Samir) , the Bishop of Alexandria, found themselves in a bitter feud in which Hypatia would come to be one of the main points of contention . The feud, which took place in 415 AD, began over the matter of Jewish dancing exhibitions in Alexandria . Since these exhibitions attracted large crowds and were commonly prone to civil disorder of varying degrees . Then was published an edict which outlined new regulations for such Jewish gatherings . Soon after, crowds gathered against Jews and these angry over the new regulations that had been imposed upon them , which many people felt was an attempt to incite the crowd into sedition .",/review/rw2128090/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2010,tytoalba-766-483232,10," The Sublime Insignificant
","It surprises me how many reviewers are giving this astonishing film only mediocre ratings, and I do hope this is not because the film chooses not to dwell on the viciousness of Hypatia's murder: a decision which would have made a cinematic 'spectacle' entirely inappropriate for this most subtle and beautiful of films. For the record, the real Hypatia - a pagan philosopher in fourth century Alexandria who deduced that the earth orbited the sun in an ellipse, and preserved her right to operate as a lecturer by repelling her suitors with a gift of a handkerchief stained with her own menstrual blood – was killed as a witch by fundamentalist Christians who scraped the living flesh from her bones with seashells. It is her life and thought, however, and not the manner of her death, which is the chief subject of this film, and that is as it should be.",/review/rw2128090/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2009,vnsfth,10," Extraordinary movie-making at its best.
","Alejandro Amenábar's masterpiece is a breathtaking excursion into religious fascism and misogynistic tyranny made special by Rachel Weisz, who probably give one of the best female acting performances in years as a scientist who was light years beyond her generation. Weisz is amazing and her performance is the show and then some. She's back up by Max Minghella, who is a great actor in his own right and Oscar Isaac, who is just as good. The triangle between them in believable and touch by their struggles to find their destinies. Its a moving cinematic piece of art and Alejandro does the story proud in his way of capturing the time of struggles of that time. Far and away, the best film I have seen all year.",/review/rw2128090/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2010,ArchStanton1862,7," Rachel Weisz Gives a Brilliant Performance. Everything Else... meh
","The chief reason to see this film is for Rachel Weisz's performance as Hypatia the philosopher. She is the main character and she gives an excellent performance. Whenever she is on screen you are riveted to the screen. Her excitement at discovery, her endless desire to learn, her ability to figure out the mysteries of the universe are fascinating and she makes them feel exciting even though we know it all already. Unfortunately, when ever she is off-screen there is nothing to hold our interest until she returns. The rest of the plot is a really blunt, unsubtle message about the dangers of religious zealotry blatantly inserted onto Hypatia's story to give it some sort of relevance. The sheer lack of subtlety and intelligence behind this message is annoying. The Christians are all bigoted, mindless, intolerant fools, and the pagans are not much better. Hypatia by contrast is presented as an atheist, which she certainly wasn't, and the only reasonable person left. I have never liked having ideas forced down my throat and this movie does that extremely roughly.",/review/rw2128090/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2010,qed,10," A necessary movie.
","I am so glad this movie was made and released is Spain, where the Catholic church still retains its grip on society. Other reviews have complained about this movie's lack of plot -- they miss the whole point. What this movie shows is what people were like in that time -- how ignorance and dogma ruled people's lives and how it caused misery and conflict. But in that fog of dull wits are always people, like Hypatia, who want to see further and understand more.",/review/rw2128090/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2010,sukhij25,8," Agora
","What a great movie. Truly inspirational. So many sides to this movie. It depicts the biography of whom I understood as the mother of Science, Hepatia. And also the effect of religion ( Or dare I say of Christianity) to the progress of human intellect and also the conflict between Human intellect and stupid faith. And love of a young slave with his mistress. And I cannot say I love one aspect more than the other. As a student who have studied science his whole academic life and who is still fascinated about the cosmos, this movie is so inspirational because it shows how great people fatigues their minds to come up with the knowledge that is common knowledge to us all now. Some say that thinking of the stars, what really happens in this world and what happens in the cosmos is no really concern of ours because in our day to day life we never get to use that knowledge. But what if we all think like that then such philosophies that gave birth to our modern sciences would have been for nothing. To know that we also share the passion, the passion of those great philosophers like hepatia in finding out the mysteries of the universe, is truly something. To ignore that passion and say that we don't want it is to disgrace the progress of science.",/review/rw2128090/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2009,jaredmobarak,8," TIFF 09: I was forgiven, but now I can't forgive  Agora
","I will not deny the fact that Alejandro Amenábar is one of my favorite directors at the moment. With the eerily creepy The Others and the emotionally wrought Mar adentro, how could he not be? And why have I not seen Abre los ojos yet? Disgraceful I know. Well, you can imagine my immense excitement when finding out his new 4th century Egyptian epic Agora would be playing as a gala presentation in Toronto for TIFF. The trailer made it seem very unlike his past movies, looking to be on a much larger scale in comparison. But it was Amenábar, so I had complete faith that he could pull it off, probably infusing it with the detail and heart the previous movies had in abundance. He spoke before the film that he wanted to make a work that tackled the subject of intolerance, to fight ""against anyone who uses violence to prove his ideas"". Using three weeks of preparation before filming began, with minimal computer effects—he wanted a ""going back in time"" realism, so extras were hired and sets were built—he definitely did the job while also shedding light on a period of history that hasn't really been done in Hollywood.",/review/rw2128090/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is one movie about Roman Egypt around 400 AD in which the Christians don't all come out on the side of the angels, at least not the prevailing Parabolian Sect in Alexandria.

17 September 2009,grmagne,9," Great re-enactment of 4th century Alexandria
","AGORA brings 4th century Alexandria back to life with some expensive, elaborate sets combined with a bit of CGI where necessary. Other than a couple of alterations to historical facts, such as the manner and location of Hypatia's death and the creation of a fictional slave character, the production team obviously did a tremendous amount of research and they stuck closer to the real facts of history closer than your typical Hollywood film does (for whatever that's worth). I'm a bit of a history buff, and I'm always excited when an ancient city is re-created with such attention to detail. But it couldn't have worked without a great cast, and Rachel Weisz was perfect for her role. She had just the right combination of charm, strength and enthusiasm for math & philosophy to convince the audience that she was a legendary intellectual that could elicit loyalty from her male students and slaves too.",/review/rw2128090/?ref_=tt_urv
