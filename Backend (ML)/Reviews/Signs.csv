17 December 2002,DennisLittrell,9," Cinderella has nothing on her
","I was surprised at how good this movie is. A remake of a movie starring Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, directed by one of the greats of American cinema, Billy Wilder, is not exactly the kind of task for the faint of heart. The fact that Sydney Pollack (They Shoot Horses Don't They? (1969), Tootsie (1982), Out of Africa (1985), etc.) decided to do it must have raised a few eyebrows in Hollywood land.",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 1999,TopDawg,," The epitome of romantic!
","Romantic is the word for this movie.  The story, the settings, everything adds up to romantic. And it's clean - no gratuitous sex scenes or foul language!  A rarity for a 90s movie.  This movie has a timeless quality to it, and part of the reason is the (again) extremely romantic score!  Many critics panned this version of ""Sabrina"", unfairly comparing it to the original Audrey Hepburn ""Sabrina"".  Nobody could ever compare to Audrey Hepburn, but Julia Ormond is a fine Sabrina in her own right.  She makes the transition from awkward teen to glamorous woman with subtlety and grace. Greg Kinnear shows a natural flair for acting in his first major movie role.",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2005,AnnikaLen,10," A romantic comedy doesn't get better than this
","I saw the original ""Sabrina"" before ever seeing the remake. I adored Audrey Hepburn in all of her movies, and this was not an exception. Her comedic timing was perfect. She was completely believable as a young ingenue, and of course, she would not be Audrey Hepburn if she weren't absolutely breakthtaking on screen. But while I enjoyed the original, I have seen it only once, whereas I have seen the remake so many times I have lost count! ",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2000,Monika-5,," Throughly enjoyable
","I really liked this film. The acting, the music, the dialogue, the gorgeous scenes of Paris and New England, and the glamourous parties. Julia Ormond is no Audrey Hepburn, but who is? I think she hit all the right notes as the shy, clumsy girl who goes away, blossoms, and comes home confident and glamourous. Ormond's Sabrina never loses her innocence or her good heart. Greg Kinnear was hilarious as the lovable ladies' man (and looks a lot like William Holden in the original). Nancy Marchand was hysterically funny as the crabby Mrs. Larabee, and John Wood turned in a good performance as Sabrina's father.",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2013,ElMaruecan82,9," A solid, if not better, remake ... faithful to the fairytale aspect of the original ""Sabrina"" and to our modern (yet no less romantic) sensitivities ...
","1995 saw the release of a great American romantic comedy in Hollywood tradition, ""The American president"", but it's Pollack's ""Sabrina"" that deserves the title because it's based on the 1954' classic, directed by Billy Wilder and starring Audrey Hepburn, William Holden and Humphrey Bogart. Yet, there's more in ""Sabrina"" than a simple remake.",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2004,TerrellFritz,10," The Salvation of Linus the King
","Tempting though it may be to compare this film to the 1954 version, you will miss the point if you do. To understand the true magic of Sydney Pollack's masterpiece, read the Samuel A. Taylor play both films were based on. While I'm sure the play was a great evening out at the theater between martinis in the 1950s, it's somewhat incredible that two film versions so profoundly translated this lightweight romantic comedy, each in its own time.",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2018,Kirpianuscus,," lovely
","The temptation to compare it with the 1954 version is not small. And it is a good thing because the film has the force to use its voice. Julia Ormond is realy Sabrina. And Harrison Ford is a revelation as Linus. But, for me, the authetic good points are Miriam Colon as lovely Rosa and Nancy Marchand as wise,fascinating Maude Larrabee. Short, a seductive film.",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2005,Wynter_Miller,," Once Upon A Time on The North Shore of Long Island...
","Comparisons are hardly ever fair, yet people insist on making them. DON'T compare this film to the original. Who cares? Judge it on it's own merits, and you'll come up with a winner. The interaction between the players is seamless. The dialog is witty, intelligent, at times touching, and always believable.",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2005,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,9," Sweet, heartwarming, and charming romance with terrific performances
","SABRINA, in my opinion, is a sweet, heartwarming, and charming romance with terrific performances. If you ask me, the way that Sabrina (Julia Ormond) and David (Greg Kinnear) met up again after several years was very romantic. It was also really funny when a ménage à trois began after Linus (Harrison Ford) fell for her, too. As far as I can see, this movie had terrific performances, excellent direction, perfect casting, and nice scenery, especially for a movie set in New York. Oh, yes, the Paris scenery was especially lovely. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, or Greg Kinnear, you should definitely see this movie. Prepare for lots of charm, wit, laughs, and romance when you see it.",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2016,ma-cortes,6," Passable remake about a chauffeur's daughter romanced by a likable young and his older brother , an aging tycoon
","Light though overlong romantic comedy-remake (of the 1954 classic movie) with nice actors , luxurious scenarios and decent direction . The known story of Sabrina (this role is a good vehicle for Julia Ormond) , the chauffeur's daughter , who falls in love for a millionaire (Greg Kinnear in his film debut) , the handsome younger brother in the wealthy mansion where her daddy works . But then , his older brother (Harrison Ford a solid acting by this veteran actor) and their mother (Nancy Marchand) are opposed to this relation. As the older sibling attempts to woo her away for for strictly business issues . ",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2021,Calicodreamin,7," Kind of sweet
","Although terribly predictable and a bit too long, this film is kind of sweet. Ford shines as in his typical role of comically aloof and Ormand plays her lead well. Good chemistry and cinematography.",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2005,MartinK75,9," Really enjoyable
","Sabrina contains about every cliché you could possibly imagine: an apparently dowdy young woman undergoing a makeover whilst abroad and returning home looking stunning; a young playboy who the girl has always loved initially failing to recognise her with her new look then pursuing her romantically; the overly-serious older brother using the girl in a plan to achieve his business ends then realising that he really does love her; the younger brother proving at the end that he's not so dumb after all - the list of stereotypes could go on and on. However having said all that, when such a seemingly familiar film is as well made and as beautifully scripted and acted as Sabrina, it's hard not to be swept along with it and to enjoy every minute. I loved the performances here, particularly from Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond. I've never seen Ford play such a staid, uncharismatic character as Linus before but I get the impression from watching the film that he enjoyed the opportunity to take on this kind of part. Ormond makes an extremely engaging leading lady, perfect for the role of Sabrina. I particularly enjoyed Sabrina's mirthful reaction to seeing Linus put on the baseball cap while he's trying to win her affection. Also very funny was Linus' effortless recognition of the new-look Sabrina thus revealing her identity to a confused David. John Willliams also contributes a nice score. This is a classy romantic comedy, well worth watching.",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv

","Chauffeur's daughter and plain Jane Ormond returns from Paris with a hair cut and some make up on. Zillionaire idiot Kinnear falls for her, threatening his engagement to a girl which is crucial to a merger deal brother Ford is organising. Ford sets out to sort Ormond out and falls for her.",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2008,gcd70,3," Don't make 'em like they used to

22 April 2007,xredgarnetx,4," Bad remake
","Harrison Ford takes on the Humphrey Bogart role in the Sidney Pollack remake of Billy Wilder's 1954 SABRINA. Greg Kinnear plays his younger brother, and Julia Ormond plays Sabrina, the free-spirited daughter of the chauffeur for the massive estate run by Ford and his mommy (Nancy Marchand). Sabrina comes home from a long stay in Paris at an awkward moment for the wealthy family, and it is up to the stuffy, aloof Ford to persuade her to return to Paris. Ford is much too old for his role, although he is very convincing in his portrayal of an obsessed business tycoon. You'd almost think he was appearing in another movie, something involving, say, a murder or kidnaping. Ormond is not nearly appealing as Audrey Hepburn from the original, and in fact she is less appealing than her costar Lauren Holly, who plays a doctor soon to marry Kinnear. So I don't buy that Ford eventually falls for Ormond at all. I also didn't give a hoot about the details of the family business. Kinnear, who is actually pretty funny as Harrison's kid brother, is inexplicably left out of the entire middle of the movie so that it can focus on Ford wooing the confused Sabrina, who thinks she loves Kinnear but then decides she loves Ford. Yuck. Imagine kissing the wrinkly-faced Ford. I would have some fun with Ormond's lackluster performance and undistinguished appearance right about here, but instead let it be said that it simply was a bad idea to remake this film. SABRINA 1995 was not Ormond's fault.",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2014,SnoopyStyle,6," Harrison Ford has difficulties as romantic lead
",Sabrina Fairchild (Julia Ormond) grew up as the mousy daughter of the chauffeur (John Wood) of the wealthy Larrabee family on the north shore of Long Island. It was a grand estate and she would spy on their grand parties from a tree. Maude Larrabee (Nancy Marchand) inherited the Larrabee Corporation from her dead husband. Cold-hearted Linus Larrabee (Harrison Ford) took the company to even greater heights. David (Greg Kinnear) is the playboy son who Sabrina is completely infatuated with. She goes off to Paris to work on Vogue as a lowly assistant. She slowly moves away from her David infatuation to a love affair with a photographer. Meanwhile David is falling for Elizabeth Tyson (Lauren Holly) whose family business Linus wants to merge with. Elizabeth wants to marry David but he is reluctant to let go of his playboy lifestyle. Sabrina comes home and David doesn't recognize her at first. David becomes infatuated threatening to derail the marriage plans and Linus' big business deal.,/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2002,helpless_dancer,7," Business before pleasure....but not love
","Like Sandra Bullock in ""Love Potion #9"", Julia Ormond went from being an ugly duckling to a swan and capturing the heart of a wealthy man who had barely noticed her before. But love turned out to be a logjam to big business so a game of high stakes emotional chicanery was launched only to turn out with unintended results. I loved this one: makes me want to see the original.",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2008,Galicius,6," Strange adaptation
","This adaptation of an almost classic film makes some weird changes and leaves others that look like an anachronism in a world forty years later. It's better to take the new film for what it is and judge it on its own merits and flaws. Sabrina's sojourn in Paris is too brief to remake her and for Paris to become an obsession on her return. How does she land directly into the world of high fashion? It's hard to accept the younger brother's sudden transformation from a playboy into the responsible serious role of his older brother. It happens towards the end just when the plot needs a new direction. Just as his new doctor finance suddenly reappears when needed. She and all the minor characters are just one-dimensional figures. Ford is wellno Bogart but Humphrey wasn't any better in the role either. Julia Ormond, despite the criticism on this forum, is the one bright star. She shines and has a bit of Hepburn quality in her radiance as a grown woman.",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2002,tfrizzell,," Wonderful Remake.
","Young Julia Ormond, the daughter of a servant, is in love with Greg Kinnear but he does not know that she exists. She goes off to Europe and returns. She is now a knock-out beauty in this nice little remake of the original from 1954. Naturally while trying to get Kinnear, Ormond will fall in love with his older brother (Harrison Ford). A nice romantic film that works because of old Hollywood ideas done in a modern, sophisticated way. 4 stars out of 5.",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2002,=G=,7," A wonderful retelling of a classic romantic comedy
","""Sabrina"" 1995 tells of a young chauffeur's daughter (Ormond) who grows up in the shadow of a wealthy family with two eligible bachelors; one all work (Ford) and the other all play (Kinnear).  Forever in love with the latter as a girl, Sabrina studies in Paris and returns years later to the estate and the dreams of her childhood which she must now address as woman. A wistful contemporary Cinderella story with a solid cast and plenty of dreamy John Williams music, ""Sabrina"" is a must see for all lovers of romantic comedy. B+",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2004,ms954,10," Sabrina is one of the finest movies I've seen...
","Many won't agree, and the critics may have panned it, but I feel this fantastic , feel-good movie exemplifies what all great movies should be: entertaining , intelligent, thoughtful, with touches of comedy, pathos, and respect for the human condition.. I find myself watching this magnificent work over and over and over, and never tiring of it. I feel Harrison Ford delivers his best performance, bar none, and really shows that he is one our best actors. Julia Ormond: well, what can I say. Just absolutely the most beautiful, sexy, wonderful actress living today... I fall in love with her all over again each time I watch the movie. Greg Kinnear is a very believable co-star and funny, funny... the players are selected very well , each contributing mightily to the final effect! The director really knew what he was doing and keeps the movie going strong.. congratulations to all. I wish there were more works like this, and would really like to see another done with Harrison Ford and Julia Ormond in the title roles, oncemore!. Bravo! Bravo!",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv

",I can't ever remember opining that a remake of any film ever made improved upon the original. The closest I can recall to this unprecedented phenomenon might apply to a sequel as opposed to a remake. (Many thought that Godfather II improved upon the original.),/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2020,MissSimonetta,6," Paris is always a good idea. Remaking classics on the other hand...
","My mother loves the original SABRINA with Audrey Hepburn and turned this one off after an hour. I was with her at the time and she said that the whole thing struck her as badly paced and much more poorly cast than the original. I picked up the rest of the movie on my own the next day, though I admit, I too was tempted to leave it unfinished. But I'm glad I didn't. SABRINA 1995 isn't that bad, but it is in every way a pale shadow of the original. Wilder's direction was much more assured while I don't think Sydney Pollack wholly believed in the material here-- the movie tries very hard to update the story to the 1990s, which ironically makes certain elements of the plot feel even more dated.",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv

29 July 2021,jace_the_film_guy,5," Fine, though a bit bland.
","Sabrina is quaint and pleasant. The tone of the film is nice, and I left thinking that it was a ""fine"" movie, though a bit bland. I would have liked more depth in Paris and a clearer perspective from the female protagonist. Harrison Ford's acting was stiff, and his reactions felt memorized rather than a give and take with the other actors. There was nothing over-the-top, inventive, or mind-blowing, and similarly there wasn't anything horrible, it was just a fine film.",/review/rw7176928/?ref_=tt_urv
