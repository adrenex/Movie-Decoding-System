15 February 2021,AlsExGal,7," Glossy, original psychological thriller...
","...with elements of mystery and Gothic horror, from Fox and co-writer and director Gore Verbinski. Dane DeHaan stars as a cutthroat financial agent in a big Wall Street firm who is tasked with traveling to Switzerland to find the firm's CEO who has checked into an exclusive health resort. Upon arrival, it doesn't take long for DeHaan to realize something is not quite right at the seemingly idyllic sanitarium, which is on the grounds of an old castle in the Swiss Alps. But try as he might, DeHaan doesn't seem able to leave the place, and the hospital's chief doctor (Jason Isaacs) doesn't seem in a rush to allow that, either.",/review/rw3642227/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2017,Ramascreen,7," Acquired taste
","Gore Verbinski, the man who gave us the first ""Ring"" movie, the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise, ""Rango,"" and ""The Lone Ranger"" is now back with this Hitchcockian Gothic psychological thriller designed to keep you guessing till the very end. Even though its final 20 minutes somewhat go off the rails a bit, overall A CURE FOR WELLNESS is stunning, bold and hypnotic.",/review/rw3642227/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2017,claudio_carvalho,7," Bizarre and Weird
","In New York, a middle-aged executive of a financial company has a fatal heart attack while working after hours in the office. The board of directors indicates the young and ambitious executive Lockhart (Dane DeHaan) to assume his position and assigns Lokhart to bring the CEO Roland Pembroke (Harry Groener) back to the company to sign a merger. Further, the company is under investigation of the government and the directors intend to blame Pembroke for dirty business. Pembroke moved to an expensive spa in a castle located in a remote location in the Swiss Alps. Lockhart heads to the place by plane, train and a limousine driven by the local driver Enrico (Ivo Nandi). On the arrival at the spa, the attendant and the director Dr. Heinrich Volmer (Jason Isaacs) do not let Lockhart speak to Pembroke and ask him to return later. Enrico drives Lockhart back to the village but there is a car accident and he returns to the spa to recover a broken leg. Soon Lockhart meets and befriends the weird teenager Hannah (Mia Goth) that drinks a liquid from a blue bottle; and an old patient that tells how the castle was built on ruins of the castle of an evil baron that wanted to marry his sister to have a pure blood child two hundred years ago. When he discovers that his sister is infertile, he uses the local residents to find a cure for his sister that was killed by the dwellers. Lockhart suspects that Dr. Volmer is performing experiments with the interns and decides to investigate the clinic.",/review/rw3642227/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2017,jzathajenious,6," Visually gorgeous, but a lazy screenplay holds it back from greatness.
","Gore Verbinski has created a visually splendid thriller/horror film, which creates a wonderfully foreboding atmosphere. However, what could have been a great film is marred by a convoluted screenplay that falls to pieces in its final act, and is riddled with plot holes. I waited patiently for all the pieces of the puzzle to fall into place (and with the running time approaching 2 and a half hours, it's quite a wait), yet ultimately I was left somewhat confused and underwhelmed by how it all played out.

16 February 2017,gcarpiceci-73268,5," Mixed feelings....
","OK, well, this is going to be a tricky review, folks, because this is a weird movie, very weird. A Cure For Wellness has the great merit of being different, and to reward the movie goer with something that stands out from the crowd; but, once you have appreciated this aspect, you might also want to be rewarded with a kind of content that gives the form some substance. And here is where A Cure For Wellness lets you down. I thought the first part of the movie was very good (rating: 8): you are simply smashed by the oneiric, hypnotic power of the images, by the stunning photography, by a breathtaking use of the camera, pretty good acting; and the intrigue created by the plot is such that you just keep asking yourself where this can reasonably go. That should have been the job of the second part (rating: 2) , where instead most of the potential built in the first half is wasted: the story, from intriguing, turns silly; the mysterious plot turns into a surreal Dracula movie which just does not make justice to itself.",/review/rw3642227/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2017,darkreignn,5," Reminded me of why I love movies, but also why I hate them
","God, what a beautiful, visually stunning, stuttering mess. I haven't seen a movie this gorgeously mediocre in a long time, and I've seen every major release this year. I don't even know where to begin, sweet Christ Almighty. Alright, first of all, this movie looks freaking amazing, like jaw- droppingly amazing. Imagine the most attractive person you've ever seen, multiply that by ten, and that's what every frame, every shot, and every scene of this movie looks like; when the movie started I literally said out loud ""this is why I love movies!"" and then as the film went on I proceeded to moan audibly, worrying my parents, as my eyes lapped up the visuals. If Nicolas Winding Refn watched this movie, I have no doubt he probably climaxed numerous times because ""A Cure for Wellness"" looks this good; it's an eyeball stimulating movie, I'll tell you that much. Seriously, it felt like me eyes were making gentle love to the screen while watching this film, and I haven't had a good eye ******* in a long time. ",/review/rw3642227/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2017,Lewis_Heather787,8," Completely Underrated !
","One of the many films that I personally forgot to see in the cinema when it was released earlier in the year, oh how much I regret missing this film now. ",/review/rw3642227/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2017,RodrigAndrisan,6," Very good except the end!
","Prepare yourself for something very special! And some harsh scenes... You will feel the ghost of Hitchcock in it but it's different. The film is very good until Volmer, The Chief Doctor(Jason Isaacs) takes his mask off. From that moment, it's completely another film, with a cheesy stupid end(there are about 2 good hours before that). The actors are all good, specially Mia Goth(very special) and Dane DeHaan. Music is cool, especially the theme with that girl voice which repeats obsessively. The cinematography is also very special. It would have been a perfect movie, if it were shorter and with a clever ending. The end is ruining the whole movie.",/review/rw3642227/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2017,rabbitmoon,5," Looks nice but feels hugely insubstantial and unsatisfying
","This film feels like a Black Mirror episode - but one that treads water for almost two and a half hours without ever reaching its main idea. 250% longer, but only a fraction of the satisfaction. ",/review/rw3642227/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2017,somf,8," Destined for cult status
","Opening up the week after John Wick 2 and 50 shades 2 and the same week as The Great Wall, does not bode well for the R rated box office of one of the most cryptic, deranged, and disturbing films ever made. You will hate this one or love it, not likely to get many in between votes. There are images in this film that I will never get out of my head. I am smarter than your average bear but I really have to see the film again to figure a lot of it out. And though I gave it an 8, I am not sure it is something I want to subject myself to again.",/review/rw3642227/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2017,ambitionz,9," It is legitimately better than the rating...
","I'll never understand why some movies end up rated the way they are. This is one of those movies. It's not groundbreaking. It's not mind blowing. But it is a great example of what a quality movie is. The acting is good to excellent. The cinematography and visuals are exceptional. The story is a little odd, but so what? Since when does a movie plot have to be within the realm of ""Normal""? It is what it is, and this one actually all comes together relatively well. The pacing, although a long movie, is actually pretty good. You'd think 2-1/2 hours is too long. After watching this movie, I'd have to disagree considering the fact that everything that happened contributes to the story and slowly builds suspense. I can see why some people don't like that, but it's unfair to rate a movie poorly simply because you don't like the style. It's not a frantic seat-of-your-pants thriller horror movie. Why do people insist on rating movies how they think they ought to be, or how they thought it was going to be, and not simply how it is?",/review/rw3642227/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2017,Quinoa1984,5," the script is all over place, and the visual creation of this world is unique. it's all mixed up
","Gore Verbinski has a terrific visual sense and yet he is always susceptible to losing track of the script and storytelling. This was evident to an extent with the 'Pirates' sequels, and it's here as well. A Cure for Wellness is filled with a weirdness in its approach to this castle-hospital that makes it like Dracula crossed with Shutter Island (to an extent). It's a filmmaker so in love with his Gothic sensibilities, even down to having an actress in Mia Goth who seems plucked out of Central Tim Burton Casting. But as you're watching it and especially after it ends, a lot of the essential things in this story and the plot make no sense. Some of this is spoilery, and some of it is not.",/review/rw3642227/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2017,wmacl,4," A potentially-great movie that ultimately lets you down.
","What can I say about this odd movie, other than that I was absolutely captivated for the first hour or so. Visually stunning, images that will live in the memory for some time, great editing, superb camera work, stunning scenery and background, and a plot that captivates and keeps you guessing.",/review/rw3642227/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2017,ferguson-6,6," Love that dirty water
","Greetings again from the darkness. It might seem peculiar for the director of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, The Lone Ranger, and the Oscar winning animated Rango to be the driving force behind an atmospheric Gothic mystery-thriller, but Gore Verbinski seems to ignore any attempt to generalize or label his films. In fact, this latest film (written with Justin Haythe) attempts to challenge genre conventions by cloaking us in familiar themes and expecting us to be surprised by the late twist.",/review/rw3642227/?ref_=tt_urv

11 December 2020,dommercaldi,5," It's Eely Weird And Entails Sloppy Story-telling
","Pros:
1. The neutral colour palette provides the film with a suitably clean, calm, and sterile feel.
2. The immaculate set and costume design also does a fantastic job at feeding into the aforementioned feel.
3. Dane DeHaan (Lockhart), Mia Goth (Hannah), and Jason Isaacs (Volmer) deliver great performances.
4. The score, when used intermittently and correctly, cements a tense, yet ethereal atmosphere.
5. The violence and gore are intense, brutal, and impactful.",/review/rw3642227/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2017,Amadio,9," Somehow overlooked classic
","Had I known what kind of film (gothic creep) A Cure was, I wouldn't have watched it. Had I known Gore Verbinski directed it, I'd have eagerly looked forward to it, expecting something along the lines of the Pirates of movies and Rango. Instead, I was treated to a tour de force in cinematography, superb acting, and a tense and exciting ride. A Cure is not an easy film to watch. While it is not exactly full-on horror, it certainly ratchets up the tension with music, atmosphere, and uncertainty about what is real or not. It is a long film, but I never felt it drag or that any scenes were wasted. And oh what scenes! Something as simple as a car driving up a hill - stunning reflections glimpsed on the bonnet (hood). Half-face lighting highlighting the descent in madness - or not. Gorgeous architecture contrasting with sterile settings of a sanatorium. Hardly a scene went by that was not an iconic shot. DeHaan was perfect in the role, as others have mentioned reminiscent of de Caprio in Shutter Island. He held the tension between confidence and possible insanity very well, leaving you wondering which way the film would turn. Jason Isaacs was excellent as the doctor you suspected all along, but were you right? And Mia Goth (talk about nominative determinism!) brilliant as Hannah. I can't say I 'enjoyed' A Cure, but it's been a long time since I have relished a film so much for its filmic qualities. If you just want entertainment, this probably won't be your thing. If you are into film and want something a little unusual, I highly recommend A Cure.",/review/rw3642227/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2019,Platypuschow,4," A Cure for Wellness: More than a little odd

","I get that some people may be already full when it comes to mystery thrillers or are a bit more skeptical in regards to them. Still it would be unfair to this to just go ahead and hate it even before watching it. It has an old school feeling to it.
