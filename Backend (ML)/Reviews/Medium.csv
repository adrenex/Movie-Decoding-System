15 March 2012,intelearts,10," 494th Review: One of the best, the very best, sport comedy out there
","This is a lot smarter than some reviewers are giving it credit for - it's tough, even nasty on the ice, but seriously not only laugh out loud, but it's also a wonderful inspirational film that both moved and surprised this reviewer.",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2012,december_starz,8," If this is your type of movie, you won't be disappointed.
","I think that if you go to see this movie, you know what you're getting into. It's essentially a love letter to the violent side of hockey written by Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg, both of whom are known for a particular kind of comedy, and it stars Seann William Scott, who is known for playing a particular kind of character. Check out the 'People who liked this also liked...' section on the page for this movie. You'll see flicks like The Hangover, Crazy, Stupid Love, and Role Models. If those are your type of movies, chances are you'll enjoy Goon. ",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2012,jimhurcomb,8," It's all about the ""feel""
","There is one element that distinguishes a ""great"" sports movie from a ""good"" sports movie. It's ""the feel"". It doesn't matter if the movie is about baseball, basketball, football or hockey. If it doesn't smack of authenticity you might as well flip over to a live game. ""The Natural"" had the feel of baseball and for hockey ""Slapshot"" has always been the template for the great hockey movie. I happily add ""Goon"" to that rarefied space.",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2011,DonFishies,7," A lot of fun when you embrace the ridiculousness of it all
","I plead ignorance: I have never seen Slap Shot, the holy grail of non- Mighty Ducks hockey films. When I ventured into the world premiere of Michael Dowse's Goon over a month ago at the Toronto International Film Festival, I felt like I missed out on required reading. But while it may be deeply indebted to the Paul Newman classic, I think Goon still manages to be unique enough that it works pretty well on its own. ",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2012,leana555,7," The trailer doesn't do this justice.
","I hadn't read or heard much about Goon before I went to see it; all I'd seen was the trailer. I didn't even realise that it was based on a true story. I wasn't expecting it to be that good, but was pleasantly surprised. ",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2012,danhall76,8," Enjoyable Movie
",I must say I was a bit nervous as a Hockey fan about how this movie would fare in UK. There is a fairly good following but there are still a lot of people who don't realise that fighting is part of the game and that 'Goons' actually do play the game.,/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2012,bonzybino,7," bloody, gritty & sporty!!
","I wasn't expecting the bloodshed in an otherwise heartfelt and appeasing movie which would be remembered for the astonishing, rather absorbing performance by Sean William Scott more than anything else. I should admit, haven't yet got the hang of Ice hockey and the fighting thing. But the sportiness and the spirit of the protagonist did rush my ante up - now that's not uncommon with Sport movies. But something's different about this one, Doug Glatt & his 69 wouldn't be that easy to forget coz he's too simple, stupid and darn crazy when he's a team guy.",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2012,brando647,9," A Hilarious Feel-Good Underdog Movie
","I am not a hockey fan. I've never watched it, never attended a game, and I could probably only name one or two NHL teams if pressed. But I am a fan of Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg so, hockey fan or not, I knew was giving GOON a chance. I'd read a really positive review of it out of last year's Toronto International Film Festival but, of course, it never got a wide release so I had to wait. It was worth the wait because I really, really liked this movie. The characters feel real, the gags are funny, and the action is brutal. The plot is pretty simple when you break it down: Doug Glatt (Sean William Scott) is a bouncer for a local dive bar and the black sheep of his family, with both his brother and father maintaining successful medical careers. Doug's just not smart enough to continue in their line, but he is great at fighting. His brutal talents are witnessed by a local hockey coach when he batters a player from the local Orangetown Assassins and Glatt's hockey career begins when he's trained as an enforcer. His role is to protect the more talented players on his team, usually through bloody beatdowns. Glatt's career takes off and he finds himself in the minor leagues where he tries to help inspire the Halifax Highlanders to their first championship in years while building to the eventual battle with legendary enforcer and one of Glatt's heroes, Ross ""the Boss"" Rhea (Liev Schreiber).",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2012,K_Antivenin,9," Puttin' on the foil, coach.
","One of my all-time favorite comedies is Slap Shot, so I had at least a marginal interest in seeing Goon. After reading a recent interview with Baruchel in the Vancouver Sun, the movie sounded like it just might have the heart to carry the flame that Slap Shot lit. Sure, no question, Goon comes off as somewhat of an homage, but it's done right, not overtly, balancing the necessary brutality and tastelessness with just enough sweetness. Which is a hell of a lot more than I can say for that pitiful attempt at a Slap Shot sequel.",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2020,masonsaul,8," Great comedy drama
","Goon is a great comedy drama that's funny, emotional and ultimately heartwarming. Sean William Scott gives an incredible lead performance and Jay Baruchel, Alison Pill, Liev Schreiber and Kim Coates all give great supporting performances. Michael Dowse's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and surprisingly visceral. It's mostly well paced as the opening feels a little rushed. The soundtrack is really good.",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2012,tomhemingway11,7," Pleasantly surprised at the years first 'dumb' comedy.
","'Goon' revolves around a very simple idea that a lovable but stupid nobody gets a chance at becoming an ice hockey champion because of his very powerful fists. Cue some of the most incredibly violent, unnecessary fight scenes seen in cinema for a long time. It makes a Quentin Tarantino film look normal! However, If you buy the idea, despite the familiar and predictable narrative, you will leave the cinema with a big grin on your face; At heart, 'Goon' is just another Indie feel-good comedy.",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2012,hippy_hazy,7," Good laughs
","Seann William Scott often fits into a certain type, to put it bluntly, silly films. After following his favourite hockey player, Doug (Scott) goes from bouncer at a pub to pro hockey player, seems to fit the bill.",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2017,patricio-53898,10," Surprisingly great
","The great thing about Goon is that, when you get right down to it, it's not a sports movie. It's not even really about hockey in the sticks and skates sense of the word. Any fan of hockey can tell you, to great length, about the bizarre and unique position of the Goon, a player with minimal hockey skills, who is utilized solely to defend the more talented players, keep defenders from the opposing team honest, and beat the snot out of someone, should the need arise. It's a niche talent, yet an important one in terms of motivation, spirit, and tone of a hockey team. That's what this movie is about. It's about utilizing the gifts you were given, carving out a place in the world for you and your talents, and the basic human need to belong to something greater, a team, a romantic relationship, a family. The movie goes out of its way to tell you that protagonist Doug ""The Thug"" Glatt is NOT a hockey player. All Doug wants is to wear a uniform and use his talents to help the people he cares about, and I think we can all relate to that. ",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv

",Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott) is a bar bouncer and an embarrassment to his doctor father (Eugene Levy). His best friend Pat (Jay Baruchel) has an online chat show Hot Ice covering hockey action. Their favorite player Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber) gets suspended. They go to a minor league game where one player comes at Pat in the stands. Doug ends up pummeling the player and becomes a sensation. He can barely skate but he still gets on the team Orangetown Assassins as a goon. He gets hired by the Halifax Highlanders to protect their valuable prospect.,/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2018,Hey_Sweden,7," ""Take the number 69, it's hilarious!""
","Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott, the ""American Pie"" series) is a slow witted and big hearted kind of guy without much ambition. He toils away as a bouncer in a bar, and it's when he manhandles a player while watching a hockey game that a coach (Nicholas Campbell, 'Da Vinci's Inquest') realizes his great potential for being an ""enforcer"". Doug is taught just enough hockey skills to get by, and is sent to the Halifax Highlanders, where he's watched over by coach Ronnie Hortense (Kim Coates, 'Sons of Anarchy') and is made to look out for star player Xavier LaFlamme (Marc-Andre Grondin, ""C.R.A.Z.Y.""). A legendary tough guy of the game, Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber, the ""Scream"" series) is soon to retire, and he sees Doug as the inheritor to his throne. And nice guy Doug falls in love with a young woman (Alison Pill, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"") who has her own self-esteem issues.",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2013,Scarecrow-88,7," Goon
","Seann William Scott is actually--I can't believe I'm writing this--endearing (!) as a simple-minded bouncer who finds his happy place as a ""goon"" (the member of the team who beats the hell out of people and protects the star) on a struggling (this is being kind) hockey team trying to just win a game. The star of the team is the disgraced Xavier LaFlamme(Marc-André Grondin), so low that he spits on his team's logo out of disgust. Xavier shares a room with Scott's Doug Glatt, and he makes no bones that he doesn't like him. But because Doug harbors no ill will, has a big lug of a heart, and ingratiates himself to his team and Xavier, this dislike might just subside. The film's key story arc--besides Doug's budding romance with Eve (Alison Pill)--is the comparisons between Doug and soon-to-be-retiring thuggish warrior, Rhea (Liev Schrieber), both on teams fighting to get into the playoffs. Rhea has been celebrated as the tough, intimidating fighter with limited hockey skills but featuring a ruthless aggression that most hockey players care to avoid, with Doug considered his ""replacement"". Rhea knows that he must put Doug in his place, but he realizes that Platt isn't some self-absorbed, conceited showoff, but a true, dye-in-the-wool team player who puts his men above himself. Also Doug isn't the monster off the hockey rink he is on; in fact, Doug is a sweet-natured, mental-intellect-of-a-child, gentle soul who uses his fists and body to protect and win for his team, no matter how limited a capacity his skills might be. He becomes the heart and soul of his team while Xavier is clearly the gifted, talented hockey player needing that motivational shot-in-the-arm Doug provides just because of his team spirit. This is a brutal, fight-heavy, battered faces, bloodthirsty, exciting, fast-moving, no-guts-no-glory, profane, spirited hockey movie. It's kickass. If you like lots of scenes where Seann's face takes a licking, swells, with bruises and larges cuts, while he sends his opponents off the rink in stretchers (after bashing their faces in), then this is for you. Schrieber is an absolute badass as the taunting heckler who backs up his remarks to opposing teams by shutting faces by sending players into unconsciousness. His closing battle with Seann is visceral and thrilling. My favorite scene--Seann stops a puck from entering the goal with his face while a rival player comes down on his ankle with a skate blade (ouch!). Jay Baruchel has a sizable supporting part as Seann's potty-mouthed buddy, often recording the hockey games and making rather obscene comments that cause the parents of Glatt (including Eugene Levy, toning down his comedy for a rather serious part as a father who is concerned for his son's safety and career) to groan/frown.",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2012,StevePulaski,8," Was he born in Big Beaver by the borderline?
","Goon bares a striking resemblance to Kevin Smith's upcoming hockey drama, Hit Somebody!, named after the famous Warren Zevon song. That film, too, is about a hockey player who can't do much more than fight, but is determined to keep his team protected. The only difference is that the song seemed to be more about a man's personal dream of being a successful hockey player despite his poor performances in games, while Goon pretty much stops at ""a man who is good at fighting on ice."" But that doesn't mean it's not an efficient comedy. Rather than creating a desperately unlikable character and tacking on a contrived romance, like in Happy Gilmore, Goon constructs a likable, if not simple-minded character who we come to not only sympathize with, but yet, kind of love. The character is Doug Glatt, played very well by Seann William Scott. Glatt isn't as smart as his father and brother, whom are both doctors, and feels extremely isolated because of it. His best friend, played by the unnecessarily vulgar and crude Jay Baruchel, takes him to a hockey game one day where, after a fight with a player, Doug finds out he has a knack for fighting.",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2012,kosmasp,7," Not your typical Sports movie
","A lot of swearing, nudity and beatings make this a really different breed of Sports movie altogether. So don't compare this to other ice hockey movies that have been done in the past, because it won't hold up against those, just because they were more sweet natured. This one is really a punch in the face, while it consistently insults you. Can you deal with that? Than you can watch it too.",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv

If you can suspend your knowledge of Ice Hockey, Yes even Minor League Hockey then this Film is a Blast.I thought it was The Best Hockey Film since Slapshot.Got some Good Acting,GREAT Fight Scenes and some Laughs too. If you are a REAL Hockey Fan you'll love it.Goon shows The Tough Side of Hockey and it's not so afraid to fight side. Yes there's Fighting in Hockey. Yes some players are hired on as Fighters.

21 January 2012,jordanmarkharding,8," Expectedly underrated
","In a very short summary, this has got to be the best tongue in cheek comedy for a very long time because its not all about a dumb hockey player there is heart in there, ambition and best of all, love. Cheesy I know, tell me about it. As a non spoiler synopsis, the movie is about a family outcast, Doug 'goon' Glatt who is superb with his fists and is recruited to play hockey but only to be on ice fist. His soon to be ex hero, Ross Rhea is also good with his fists and a is a famous on pitch trouble maker. The film follows Doug through many games with plenty of punch throwing intertwined and also inevitably leads to a head to battle between Rhea and Glatt. In the end this is a massively underestimated movie and deserves more to be honest. Watch it you will not be disappointed.",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2013,aequitas_veritas_007,7," Solid Little Comedy
","Yes I only rated this 7/10, however that is fairly high in my world for a comedy film. This movie is surprising to me for there are not many comedies made nowadays that are very well presented/original. I would like to say I am a sports fan as well, but the National Football League doesn't quite encompass all sports. I would recommend this film as a solid and quite humorous comedy that will be a nice viewing for guys and gals alike. A bit clichéd storyline but it works very well in this case. I will not be buying the DVD, but would recommend this to people who want an evening with popcorn and a blanket on the couch kinda night.",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Goon"" stars Seann William Scott as Doug Glatt, a dimwitted bouncer who manages to make his way onto a local hockey team. His role? He's an enforcer, a violent position which requires him to get into bloody fist fights with opposing players. Offering respite from these scenes of violence is a hastily sketched romance between Doug and Eva, played by Alison Phill. She's a hockey fan who, like Doug, views herself as damaged goods.",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2012,cormac_zoso,9," Old-Time Hockey ... Eddie Shore ... Eddie Shore ...
","Just wow ... that's all I can say ... I never expected to see another sports movie let alone another in the very small hockey genre that would approach the all-time classic, ""Slap Shot"", but this is the little goon that could. Outstanding flick that any hockey fan would love. While I see many people here talking about the ridiculousness of the fighting, frankly, I stopped watching hockey after they made so many pussy rule changes after the Broad Street Bullies fought, gouged and chewed their way to a Stanley Cup. That was hockey, my friends, and ""Goon"" lives up to the great names of Bobby Clarke and Dave ""The Hammer"" Schultz (I guess we'll have to say ""The Original Hammer"" now after during the credits of this movie we see a minor league goon with the same nickname) and the legend of Dave ""The Family"" Manson who played for the Blackhawks in the 90s and broke Schultz' long-standing single-season penalty minutes record and they didn't even include the 20-some games he was suspended that year (the longest suspension coming when he returned to the ice after ejected and saw on the TV that the fight was still going on and returned to the ice to dive into a small pile ... unfortunately, a ref happened to be tangled up in the small pile and so he was suspended even longer ... but amazingly enough, Manson learned to be a good player and not just a goon. But that was a wonderful season we all look back on with a little tear in our eye for that wonderful 150-lbs goon ... yeah you read that right ... this guy was the size of Wayne ""The Pussy"" Gretske and fought like The Hammer. Unbelievable! Now that's hockey, my friends.",/review/rw2634843/?ref_=tt_urv
