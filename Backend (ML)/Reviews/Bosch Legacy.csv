10 November 2017,WylieJJordan,5," Difficult to Review
","Difficult Kenneth Branagh makes, produces, and stars in good movies, and this version of Murder on the Orient Express features impressive sets, beautiful scenery, and lovely period clothes. An impressive case features Penélope Cruz, Johnny Depp, Derek Jacobi, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe, and Kennth Branagh as Hercule Poirot. I think those who are not familiar with Agatha Christie, Poirot, or the story may very well like this movie.",/review/rw7274056/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2021,Leofwine_draca,4," Everything wrong with Hollywood
","An uninteresting new version of the classic Agatha Christie murder mystery, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS screams everything that's wrong with modern Hollywood. It's been shot on a fake-looking green screen of snowbound vistas, and from the moment it randomly adds martial arts into the story early on I knew it wouldn't be much good. An impressive all-star cast is assembled only for the actors to be wasted in paper-thin roles, while Kenneth Branagh's Poirot gets all of the screen time and attention. He's surprisingly average in the role, easily exceeded by the earlier stars who played the character; Ustinov, for example, but in particular the definitive Suchet. The film adds humour and quirk to the tale but just begins dragging after a while, leading to a shrill and hysterical climax.",/review/rw7274056/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2017,TheLittleSongbird,5," Doesn't completely derail, but doesn't have enough steam
","'Murder on the Orient Express' as a book is, speaking as a big Agatha Christie fan, one of her best with a compelling and twisty story, many characters that are also nicely developed and one of her most ingenious endings (along with 'And Then There Were None', 'Death on the Nile', 'The Murder of Roger Ackroyd' and 'Witness for the Prosecution').",/review/rw7274056/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2017,Sleepin_Dragon,7," Visually stunning, fairly decent film.
","I must admit as an Agatha Christie obsessed fan, my initial thoughts were of pure joy, it's been a while since Agatha Christie was on the big screen, appealing to new fans, and how magnificent that such a stellar cast was assembled. Then I thought, of all the titles, why go for such an obvious choice, which has been done several times.",/review/rw7274056/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2018,m-arsic0708,2," How Agatha Christie was brutally ruined
","This movie is actually a piece of art. It takes a really true artist to ruin Agatha Christie at her best and a Dench-lead cast and come up with a boring Branagh soliloquy. What he has made out of Poirot, it's just unbelievable. I don't remember him being described as a walrus in any of the books where he also has converstations with all involved so that readers/audience can participate somehow. In this movie it's just Branagh, he knows it all, he sees it all and he understands it all. Out of thin air. Such wonderful actors were gathered for this monstrosity and it felt as is they were there only a set for Branagh. And oh yes, when talking about scenery - which ignorant fool came up with alps between Vinkovci and Brod??????? The thing is, there is nothing going on in this film, no suspension building up, no substance. It is just a pale vessel for Kenneth Branagh to try shining. 
Watch 1974 Lumet version. And from what i hear, it's going to be a sequel, Death on the Nile. Watch 1978 John Guillermin version. Branagh should.
My review does not contain spoilers, there's not enough substance to spoil anything.",/review/rw7274056/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2020,nicholls_les,1," Kenneth Branagh's massive ego trip
","Awful movie where Kenneth Branagh self indulges himself at every turn. He clearly believes he is a great actor, but is in fact awful and unbelievable as Poirot. His directing is even worse and why all those much better actors agreed to appear in this trash is the real mystery.",/review/rw7274056/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2017,duffjerroldorg,4," From The Vast Agatha Christie Collection
","Why remake Murder On The Orient Express when there are so many titles from Agatha Christie's bibliography that have never been made. Specially this one, directed in 1974 by Sidney Lumet - a genius at having many great actors within a confined space, think 12 Angry Men - with a cast that was to die for. The 2017 Kenneth Brannagh couldn't survive the comparison and it doesn't. I missed the elegance and the wit. Albert Finney got an Oscar nomination for his Hercules Poirot here Kenneth Brannagh's mustache will get all the attention as well as Johnny Depp's incomprehensible performance. Then, of course, the score. The original Richard Rodney Bennett became a classic. So, I ask you, was this necessary?",/review/rw7274056/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2018,man14,3," A Poirot for the clinicaly dumb
","Ever since I heard that Kenneth Brannagh was going to direct, produce and star in this movie that I dreaded this would happen, and it did - Brannagh is so self centered that he made the whole film about himself, turning the rest of the cast into mere decorations. He managed to turn this Christie's masterpiece into a self agrandising piece of crap. Let's just say that it makes the 2002 version with Alfred Molina look like a masterpiece in comparison - and that's saying a lot, because it was simply one of the worst films I'd ever seen.
I don't know who the hell Brannagh is supposed to be playing, but it sure as hell isn't Poirot - not the one Agatha Christie wrote about. Anyone who has read her books about the egg shapped belgian sleuth - and I have, all of them, more than once - knows that he's nothing like the buffon Brannagh plays in the movie: Poirot walking on top of the train!?? Going beneath the train!?? Poirot willingly plunging his shoe into a pile of excrements just so both his shoes get equally dirty, all in the name of simetry!?? For the love of all that is holy! Poirot would have an apoplexy if only one of his shoes got accidently dirty with sh@t, can you imagine him doing it on purpose!? And what about that freaking mustache? It's so damn big it becomes distracting. Poirot's mustache is supposed to be big, yes, but not gigantic! And what's with the fly in his chin? Poirot doesn't have one, what was Brannagh thinking? Oh yeah, I forgot, he wasn't. And don't let me get started on the annoyingly fake french accent he uses throughout all the freaking movie - he even mispronounces repeatedly the plural for egg (oeufs), and Poirot is supposed to be a french speaking belgian! 
Also, on this film Poirot doesn't have conversations with people, as he does in the novel, he simply delivers endless monologues, conjuring facts out of thin air (or out of his ass, is more likely), things he couldn't possibly have known. He looks more like a witch than a detective. And he's everywhere, in every freaking scene. Ego much, Brannagh?
Brannagh's direction is so pedestrian it hurts. All those freaking camera angles - shooting the damn train from every possible position, shooting the action literaly from above, - were so ridiculous and pretensious, it's beyond words. It's the worst kind of in your face grandstanding directing you could get.
The screenplay is beyond bad - it completely butchers one of Christie's masterpieces by adding sex and violence that wasn't there, dumbing down her expert character development and plot, and adding artificial diversity just to please the hollywwod pc bullshit brigade. Don't get me wrong, I'm all in favor of diversity, but in movies that take place in na era where diversity exists, like today or the future. But in a story that takes place in 1934, in the most luxurious train in the world? Really? Can you really see a black doctor travelling in first class on the Orient Express in 1934? As much as I hate it, the answer can only be one to anyone familiar with the world's history: hell no! Nevertheless, that's what you have: an amalgamation of two characters into one black british doctor in love with a white middle class english girl, all for the sake of hitting the audience over the head with not so subtle references to the terrible evils of racism. If only Hollywood would get it in their thick heads that audiences only want to be told a good story, not to be preached at every time they go to watch a movie...
In conclusion, this is Poirot for the clinicaly dumb. You want to see the real Poirot, as he should be played? Watch the ITV series ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"" with David Suchet - he IS Poirot, period. Want to watch the best version of this story? Watch the 1974 version, directed by Sidney Lumet and learn how to correctly adapt Agatha Christie. But better yet, buy the freaking novel and read it - you still know what reading an actual book is like, don't you? Either way, do yourself a favor and stay away from this piece of garbage (I'm giving it three stars for the sets and costumes, for Judi Dench and for Johnny Deep, that's it).",/review/rw7274056/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2017,bob-the-movie-man,7," You'll never guess who dunnit
","There's a big problem with Kenneth Branagh's 2017 filming of the Hercule Poirot-based murder mystery. and that's the 1974 Sidney Lumet classic featuring Albert Finney in the starring role. For that film was so memorable – at least, the ""who"" of the ""whodunnit"" (no spoilers here) was so memorable – that any remake is likely to be tarnished by that knowledge. If you go into this film blissfully unaware of the plot, you are a lucky man/woman. For this is a classic Agatha Christie yarn.",/review/rw7274056/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2018,claudio_carvalho,4," Totally Disappointing, Despite the Great Cast and Art Direction
","""Murder on the Orient Express"" is a totally disappointing film, despite the great cast and art direction. The classic Agatha Christie´s novel and his detective Hercule Poiro never works in a boring screenplay with non-likable characters. Fans of Agatha Christie will certainly hate this forgettable version. My vote is four.",/review/rw7274056/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2020,VADigger,1," Why was this made?
","This film apparently wants to be both a classic mystery and one that appeals to the video game generation. It doesn't work. The CGI backgrounds are so obvious, there is no real sense of place. Poirot has been turned into an action figure, racing up and down a rickety trestle in a completely unnecessary scene. You may be tempted to look for the button that shoots out lasers or something. The film focuses so much on Branagh that the audience never really connects with the rest of the cast, making the summation a bit baffling. In a final insult, the closing credits are accompanied by a perfectly dreadful, doleful song.",/review/rw7274056/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2017,fletcherc21,6," Fans of Poirot steer clear, for there is no Poirot here
","This movie was clearly made for a modern audience with no familiarity with Agatha Christie's work. Branagh's portrayal of the legendary Belgian detective Hercule Poirot bares only a passing resemblance to the source material with an inconsistent accent, the wrong mustache, and only some of his iconic quirks and mannerisms. That being said, it is a decent mystery that follows the plot of the story pretty well and it would probably be enjoyable to people seeing the story for the first time and having no preconceived notions of what Poirot should be.",/review/rw7274056/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2018,borromeot,2," A Thoughtless Remake
","Sidney Lumet directed this Agatha Christie classic back in 1974. Albert Finney played Poirot and he was delicious and got an Oscar nomination for it. The rest of the cast was a cohesive group of heavyweights from Ingrid Bergman to Vanessa Redgrave, from Sean Connery to John Gielgud it also had a period reconstruction in scrumptious detail, wit, elegance and an infectious score. None of it is present in this new incarnation. None of it. No, the new version reeks of thoughtlessness and CGI. The actors seem to have been invited, not to play characters, but to watch Kenneth Brannagh act.",/review/rw7274056/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2017,Hitchcoc,6," The Little Engine That Couldn't
","I have to agree with several others who have commented on this film. It lacks any sort of spark. Each actor plays to the camera and there is little interaction among them. Johnny Depp is pretty good as the victim, but even he seems a caricature. It is a star studded cast and that may have been a mistake. Branagh's Poirot is so dull. And that awful mustache. It looks like he glued on the bristles from a hair brush. The plot is confusing and there is little mystery. When I saw the first film, I knew the ending, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. There are several strange events that take place in this one. Poirot is way to brusque and unpleasant. My picture of him is a kind of shyness. The ending scene, where things are explained and the murderer revealed, is incredibly dull. Too much hoopla and not enough good direction.",/review/rw7274056/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2017,postmortem-books,2," Unnecessary remake.
","I am loathe to put the boot in to any film but the barrage of publicity for this, plastered all over the BBC news and chat shows - Graham Norton and Andrew Marr interviewing the phalanx of ""stars"" in a suitable subservient way - has pushed this reviewer over the edge. It is a film that didn't need a remake since the original was perfectly acted and nuanced. Perhaps that is half the problem - I know the ""solution"" and therefore the denouement is no surprise- but there is something more deeply flawed with this movie. Firstly - that moustache. Ridiculous and in the end it becomes something that you stare at and wonder just why something so outrageously stupid would NOT get in the way of what words the actor is actually saying. You stop listening and just try and see where it is stuck on. Branagh stomps around the various scenes like Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia (even down to walking along the top of the snow-covered carriage as if he was king of the castle) and then addresses the suspects in a scene that is reminiscent of The Last Supper painting. Everywhere he goes everyone knows him. Absolutely everyone. The opening scenes in Jerusalem are unnecessary and only serve to raise Branagh/Poirot into God like status where the population of the city are happy to take his word and trample a suspect policeman to death. No jury, no trial, lynch mob rules. All of which seems to bother the guardian of justice not one jot.",/review/rw7274056/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2017,LloydBayer,4," Agatha would be aghast
","Although the story remains fairly true to the 1934 novel of the same name by Agatha Christie, this third screen adaptation (following adaptations in 1974 and 2001) is a bit of a mess. And that's putting it mildly. Worse, and as ironical as it sounds, the film loses steam even before the titular locomotive pulls out of the first act. An all- star cast lead by director Kenneth Branagh himself isn't enough, even with the latter portraying Belgian master detective Hercule Poirot who turns out to be more moustache than man. Which is sad, given that literary crime fiction has Poirot second only to Arthur Conan Doyle's super sleuth on 221B Baker Street. But in this film, Christie's most famous character is reduced to a mumbling idiot who would rather set both feet in horse poop just to make a half-baked point about order and balance.

21 November 2018,kosmasp,7," On track
","I haven't seen the original 70s adaptation of the movie. I wanted to before watching this, but a friend wanted to watch it and I just did. I actually quite enjoyed it. It starts quite nice with a twist in the first case if you want to call it that. Generally speaking Kenneth does a great job directing and acting in his own movie.
The scope cinematically speaking is just amazing. You can't fault the movie when it comes to the cinematography. I think the acting is really good and the story is tension filled, so there goes that. I did not see the conclusion coming the way it did, but I guess it makes sense. And even then you get another nod at the end of this to something that might be in the Horizon. Sign me up for it, is what I would say. Entertaining and more than decent overall",/review/rw7274056/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2018,Vodmoskva,4," Branagh's Ego Trip
","As director and leading actor, Branagh has turned this movie into one of the most excessive, narcissistic films ever made. With so many great actors and actresses, one is left wondering why they would waste their time to be in this production. The director gives none of them a chance to shine. Branagh's mustache is the star of the show and, unfortunately, the only part of the movie I'm likely to remember. With so much star power, I made the mistake of not reading reviews first. If I had, I probably would have avoided this terrible ego trip. Most viewers would do well to skip this one.",/review/rw7274056/?ref_=tt_urv

",Just don't mess with something unless you can do it better. Kenneth Branagh directs and stars as Hercule Poirot in this rendition Agatha Christie's classic. The cinematography is worth talking about. Watching the fabled Oriental Express race through snow-swept mountains before it derails.

","Famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is travelling on the Orient Express when a murder is committed. The victim was a particularly obnoxious man with a criminal past.

22 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Entertaining and intriguing right to the end!
","I saw this without any foreknowledge of the story despite its history. As a Brannagh admirer I also expected a lot. As such it was a great performance by a great cast. Those who didnâ(TM)t like it perplex me. This is not a modern crime story with action or violence or explosions to distract us. Like Sherlock Homes, Poirot is detective who use his mind and observation skills rather than physical action and violence to solve his case. The filming is perfect, the pace slow and steady, the denouement handled with precision. If you go into this expecting a James Bond type movie ( which I really like precisely because it they are full of action and spectacle but not too much intellectual input !), you will be disappointed. But if you expect to have your mind intrigued and you like to solve crime, then you will not be disappointed. I suspect it will be more enjoyable if you have no idea as to the true plot line, so if you have read the story in the past, it would help if you do not re-read it and you have forgotten some of the details.",/review/rw7274056/?ref_=tt_urv
