30 July 2016,krocheav,8," There Is Another Untold Story Within This Interesting Work
","There's a story behind this movies existence that is as interesting as the film itself. It's disappointing to know that scenes involving the original story writers daughter (played by veteran Eileen Atkins) were deleted prior to the films release. Unfortunately, all that's left of these scenes is a montage of pages from her mothers original manuscript shown under the end credits - using these notes in this way can prove a little confusing for those unaware of the origins of these writings - as it tends to appear as if the films story was based on factual characters (while I'm sure many were indeed based on very real people and for the most part the instances portrayed were founded on some terrible historical facts).

","During war time sacrifices have to be made. Some have to do with our private space, some with our personal space too. All dig into our personal life and depending on the person invading (pun somewhat intended) it will lead to different results. So we may be inclined to paint every Nazi as a bad person or just a demon/devil without any depth or sympathy for that person.",/review/rw3203265/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2015,dromasca,7," love in times of war
","The life and death of Irène Némirovsky and the fate of the cycle of novels that inspired 'Suite francaise' could be the subject of a thrilling movie, a different one. Born in 1903 in an Ukrainian Jewish family, she took refuge to France after the First World War with her family flying the Russian revolution, but was never granted French citizenship. Converting to Catholicism and writing French nationalistic (some consider these anti-Semitic) fiction did not spare her the fate of the majority of the French Jews - deportation to the concentration camps and death (at Auschwitz). 'Suite francaise' was planned to be a five volumes saga about the years of war, written as the events happened. Irene Nemirovsky wrote only two of them before being deported, the manuscript was unread for more than half of a century until discovered by her daughter and published as what has become a historical novel about the years of the war.",/review/rw3203265/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2015,Garcwrites,9," Deep, surprising and well done
","Suite Française sounds like an overused plot that one can predict from a mile away but it's not. The story's not another version of Romeo and Juliet's impossible love. It's subtle, sweet, and smart because it makes you think - just a little bit don't worry - about morals, values, and ideologies our own and that of the ones we love. The film is about a blooming love story but a complicated one. ",/review/rw3203265/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2015,waswasere,9," An everyday story of collaboration and betrayal

18 March 2015,Figgy66-915-598470,9," A tale of love, and survival amid the horror of war
","18 March 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Suite Française. Based on an unfinished series of books by Irène Némirovsky, a Ukranian Jew who died in Auschwitz, they were discovered and held by her children, but not read until 1998. They were eventually published as a single volume in 2004 and this film is the adaptation of that printed story. It's a tale of life in the war, a tale of love, betrayal, a tale of deceit and survival. Lucile is a young girl forced to live with her severe and controlling Mother-in-Law, played exceptionally well by Kristin Scott Thomas. When their village is occupied by the Germans they are forced to play host to a German Officer, but he is unlike the others. Lucile is a timid put upon girl who appears to meekly abide by what her Mother-in-Law decrees, but as the film gains momentum we see her true character assert itself. This is a tale of everyday people, trying to survive as the horror of war is raging around them. Very beautifully shot with a delicate soundtrack revolving around the piece of music written by the young German Officer. Once again you leave the cinema with the feeling of futility, and waste which come from watching stories about the war, but also in a peculiar way, I had the sense of having watched something very beautiful.",/review/rw3203265/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2015,JonathanWalford,10," Flawless film about the first summer of the war in France
","What a strange feeling it must be to wake up one morning in familiar surroundings where nothing is familiar anymore This film captures what it was like to live under occupation in France during the early months of the war. It is a captivating story about Lucille, a soft- hearted woman played by Michelle Phillips, whose husband is a prisoner of war. She lives with her severe, controlling mother-in-law, played by Kristin Scott Thomas. The two of them are in the middle of collecting rents from their tenants when the war suddenly comes to town. Over the next few months everything these people thought they knew about themselves and each other changes. German officers are billeted out to homes of villagers, some of whom vindictively write letters denouncing neighbours or accuse sympathizers of liaising with Germans. While Lucille discovers the truth about her husband she begins to fall in love with the sensitive German officer who lives under their roof, until the self-centred mayor's wife sets in motion a series of events that rips the town apart.",/review/rw3203265/?ref_=tt_urv

15 May 2016,robert-temple-1,10," An impeccable telling of a tragic tale
","This is a film of the first two volumes of a planned five-volume novel by Irène Némirovsky (aka Irina Lvivna Nemirovska, born in Kiev), born 1903, died in Auschwitz on 17 August 1942. Némirovsky was a successful Jewish writer living in France who in her lifetime published three novels, all of which were filmed: David GOLDER (1931, filmed a second time in 1950) and LE BAL (1931, filmed a second time in 1993). In 2015 a film was made in France of her novel DEUX. She was arrested as a Jew by the Gestapo just after finishing volume two of her final novel. The manuscript remained in a suitcase and was not looked at until 1998, when it was rediscovered and published in France to great acclaim. The female lead in this film is played by the amazing Michelle Williams, one of our most talented film actresses in the world, whose work I have previously had occasion to praise to the skies, as for instance in LAND OF PLENTY (2004, see my review) and INCENDIARY (2008, see my review). In this film she has a rather subdued role, of a young woman who is shy and emotionally suppressed, living under the tyrannical eye of an authoritarian other-in-law, played sternly by Kristin Scott Thomas. The other spectacular performance in the film is by Matthias Schoenaerts, He is a Belgian actor (his name is Flemish). He plays the polite Lieutenant in the Wehrmacht who is billeted in Michelle Williams's house. He is not only a classical pianist but a composer. The music he composes while he lives in the house he names 'Suite Francaise', hence the title of the film. It is a very pleasant piece of music originally composed for the film by Alexandre Desplats, the French film composer. The film is superbly directed by Saul Dibb, who also jointly wrote the screenplay. The story is extremely sad and full of pathos. It shows clearly the bombing of the columns of civilian refugees from Paris by the psychotic pilots of the Luftwaffe. As we now live in an age of refugees once again, it is possible to appreciate more fully the horrors experienced by the French refugees shown in this film. We have the usual sadistic Nazi assassination of a Mayor as a reprisal to the inhabitants of a small town. Such films serve to remind us always of what happened under Nazi rule. But the biggest revelation is the avalanche of letters informing on people, a massive betrayal by the French against themselves, eager to settle scores with their neighbours by turning them in to the Nazis, not bothering much whether the information provided is true or lies. We also see the Mayor openly collaborating with the occupiers (before he is shot, that is). The film is very powerful and emotionally upsetting, and an excellent cinematic achievement.",/review/rw3203265/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2020,TaylorYee94,8," I will be personal here. Matthias Schoenaerts is born for romance movie.
","His eyes can express sorrow, longing, passion, and vulnerability at the same time. I understand he is a Nazi official, but the chemistry between Lucille and Bruno gives me butterfly in the stomach, and I become a hopeless romantic. The story development of French's independent movement and the ending ended in a little hurry, but overall every scene of the movie is written 'romance' all over because of color and lighting.",/review/rw3203265/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2015,jmkaep,10," Enjoyed this because I loved the book
","I am a 63 year old female so my tastes differ from those of the younger demographic. I enjoyed this movie, I think it follows the book fairly closely. Read the book a while ago, so I don't remember exactly. Michelle Williams was good considering she mostly had to stand around looking scared, great English accent. Kristin Scott was icy and imperious. Maybe a bit over the top.",/review/rw3203265/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2015,rjsf96,7," A Rare Love Story, One That Rings True
","Perhaps the best thing about 'Suite Française' is that the love story is intriguing. This is a rare thing nowadays and brings to mind the great heyday of romance in the Seventies. 'Suite Française' is set in Nazi occupied France during the start of World War II. You will therefore be crying with powerful and furious emotion. Michelle Williams is at the fore front of this film; gladly she does not fail or let the production team down in any respect. She plays a French Villager (I think) called Lucile Angellier. I say this statement with doubt as last time I checked French people did not speak English as their first language. Her overbearing mother is played with severity by Kristin Scott Thomas. She outright leads her daughter's life for her and plays a prominent role in all of her decisions, whether they be little or large. Their village becomes ruled and dictated by German soldiers, some much more brutal than others. There are different personalities and beliefs to each of them. This is great to see, because it paints a broader and larger painting. It shows us that not everyone can be placed definitively into a category.",/review/rw3203265/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2015,davidgee,7," Bitter suite
","SUITE FRANCAISE comes with a 'genesis' story, of which we are reminded in the end credits. The Jewish author died in Auschwitz, having written the first two novels of a planned quintet in notebooks which were only rediscovered in 1998 and republished in 2004. This Anne Frank back story is more poignant than the romance in the book and the movie.",/review/rw3203265/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2015,JamesHitchcock,6," I came to the film expecting something special. It isn't.
","Irène Némirovsky was a French author of Jewish origins, who died in 1942 during the Holocaust; her last novel ""Suite Française"" was discovered in manuscript by her daughter in the nineties and first published in 2004. This film is officially an Anglo-Franco-German co-production, but features an American leading lady and, although the German characters speak to one another in their own language, the French ones all speak English. Such is the Anglo-Saxon domination of the movie business these days that the French find it difficult to get a French-language film made out of a novel set in France by a leading French novelist.

6 November 2015,mompaxton-481-121381,7," Beautiful
","What a lovely movie. A truly horrid time, war, finds something so real and alive, love and passion. Michelle Williams is a true untapped resource for a strong performance. I wish she did more films. She is stunning in the most real and beautiful way. She draws you in and makes you feel every emotion tenfold. A true powerhouse of talent. Kristin Scott Thomas plays the perfect stone old maid but with an underlying warm heart. In a time of war everyone had to brick their hearts away or be dragged under by the war machine. She portrays that beautifully. She plays the part from top to bottom with the zest of a Disney villain. BUT, don't judge too quickly. Matthias....ahhh Matthias. Can't get me enough of him. Yet another hidden gem of Hollywood.",/review/rw3203265/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2020,paul2001sw-1,5," Over familliar
","The story of 'Suite Francaise' has overtones of Captain Corelli, as it focuses on the complex relationships between the women of an occupied country (in this case France) and their occupiers. The novel it is based on was actually written during the war by a French woman who did not survive it, and discovered and published only many decades later. Unfortunately, the film is rather flat, and feels morally simplified. The use of English throughout obscures any differences in local culture that might have enriched the over-familliar resistance v Nazis narrative, while Kristen Scott-Thomas is wasted, not for the first time, by being cast in the role of mean hag (the two heroines, needless to say, are both young and conventionally pretty). The closing credits, revealing the story of the story, were more interesting to me than the tale itself.",/review/rw3203265/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2022,ilovesaturdays,," Humanity at war
","I started watching this movie with very low expectations since the concept of a love story between a Frenchwoman & a Nazi officer is not new. I loved 'The Silence of the Sea' (2004) & couldn't see how any movie with the same concept could top that for me. And while this movie isn't actually better, it still is beautiful & interesting in its own right. It has its flaws too, e.g., it is a bit weak in the beginning (the first 10 minutes or so), the background music feels out of place sometimes, French is replaced by English while German is still German and Michelle Williams is miscast. But when all is said and done, there are many things that work for the movie, e.g., excellent cinematography, a hauntingly beautiful piano composition, Kristin Scott Thomas, Matthias Schoenaerts, Lambert Wilson and beautiful characterizations of even the minor characters. Kristin Scott Thomas is very convincing as Michelle William's overbearing mother-in-law. She is also a mother who misses her son terribly. Matthias Schoenaerts is believable as the good German citizen who used to be a composer in the pre-war days. He has hardly ever spent any time with his wife these past 4 years after their war-time wedding and believes that she has drifted away from him. His military background & patriotism brought him into a war that he no longer believes in. He has resorted to following his orders without questioning the morality of his acts. But when he sees the brutal treatment of the French civilians by his countrymen, his sense of alienation increases. He can no longer hide away from the fact that the Nazi philosophy is utterly flawed. Music is his only salvation & therefore naturally, he feels drawn to the only human being who loves music as much as he does.",/review/rw3203265/?ref_=tt_urv
