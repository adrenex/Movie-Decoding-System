21 December 2008,Vic_max,," Clever Writing ....
","Although the subject matter wasn't really appealing to me, the critics and general audience reviews are right: this is a very well made movie. The acting is great, the plot fast-paced, the characters believable and the dialog witty and clever. It reminds me of Superbad - another movie that I would never normally see, but one which wins you over by it's sheer (albeit crude) brilliance.",/review/rw1667569/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2007,RabidED990,8," Vulgar, Sure, But Certainly Not Stupid.
","I've noticed a lot of the negative comments about this title tend to focus on this movie's vulgar, 'stupid' humor. Now let's get one thing straight. Knocked Up is vulgar, absolutely it is, but is is not stupid. Stupid humor is crap like ""Mr. Woodcock"" and ""Good Luck Chuck,"" movies with no real craft to any of their jokes.",/review/rw1667569/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2007,ferguson-6,8," Just Do It Already
","Greetings again from the darkness. ""Freaks and Geeks"" lives on through multiple tie-ins - not the least of which is writer/director and producer Judd Apatow (best known for his smash hit ""40 Year Old Virgin""). This is a sharp comedy and cutting insight thanks to a terrific script, excellent comedic timing from Seth Rogen and Apatow's feel for a scene.",/review/rw1667569/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2007,se7en187,9," A simple story is made into a very entertaining comedy
","Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) meets Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) at a bar, they get drunk and have a little fun afterward, then they part ways. That is, until a few weeks later, Alison discovers she's pregnant and Ben is the father. This simple story makes up the hilarious film Knocked Up. I really enjoyed this, it has a lot of great laughs and it also has a lot of heart spread throughout.",/review/rw1667569/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2007,EUyeshima,8," No Pregnant Pauses in A Sharp, Often Hilarious Character-Driven Comedy with Loads of Heart
","Probably because there is something fundamentally poignant about watching people you deem hopeless stumbling toward responsibility, this movie reminds me of the old Natalie Wood/Steve McQueen dramedy, 1963's ""Love With the Proper Stranger"", about a Macy's salesgirl who gets impregnated by a ne'er-do-well jazz musician during a one-night stand and then tracks what happens afterward. However, this is the 21st century, and the girl is now an interviewer on E!, and the guy is a very non-McQueen-like slacker in this uproarious and quite humane 2007 comedy, the latest work from writer/director Judd Apatow (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin""). In both comedies, he manages an amazing balancing act between a raunchy, post-frat hilarity and a shrewdly observed social commentary. Yet, there is no discernible fluctuation in the humor or the genuinely good spirit the films generate. Blessedly free of exhausting crescendo moments, the dialogue has a nice ramshackle feel and so do the characters. You really feel you want to know what happens to them after the film ends.",/review/rw1667569/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2007,hellokristen,8," Surprisingly Funny
","From the title I expected an idiot-teen comedy, but it was quite a grown-up comedy. I envision teen boys liking the first 10 minutes (a chubby slacker gets to nail a hot chick after meeting her in a bar), then fleeing when the movie gets into REAL ""adult themes"". Uh-oh. She's pregnant. Now what happens? ",/review/rw1667569/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2008,claudio_carvalho,6," Funny and Entertaining
","When Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is promoted in E! Television, she goes to a night-club to celebrate with her older married sister Debbie (Leslie Mann). Alison meets the pothead reckless Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) and while having a small talk with him, Debbie's husband Pete (Paul Rudd) calls her to tell that their daughter has chickenpox. Debbie immediately leaves the place but Allison stays with Ben, drinking and dancing along all night; completely wasted, they end up having a one night stand. Ben does not use condom and eight weeks later, Allison discovers that she is pregnant. She calls Ben and they decide to try to stay together and have the baby. But the immatures Ben needs to grow-up first to raise a family of his own.",/review/rw1667569/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2007,MovieAddict2016,6," I can see what people admire and praise about it - but I think some are going too far.
","""Knocked Up"" is a well-made, enjoyable comedy about the consequences of an unprotected one-night stand. It has dual lessons for its lead characters: Seth Rogen has to learn to grow up and accept responsibility and Katherine Heigl has to choose between a professional life as a television interviewer or a possibly less rewarding (as she sees it) life as a stay-at-home mom.",/review/rw1667569/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2008,movieman-200,1," Gutless and Moronic and Intellectually Insulting
","What would you do if you became pregnant by an oversexed bong-snorting gross pig of a human being after one drunken night of bar-hopping debauchery? Such is the question proposed in Judd Apatow's Knocked Up (2007) a mindlessly indoctrinating and strained, weak-premised regurgitation of that 'what if' and 'day after' scenario. The film is populated by thoughtless/clueless individuals who wouldn't be able to discover their own navels with two hands and a compass. This is a movie as primary and obvious in its effects as any clap-trap about twenty-somethings who should never become parents.",/review/rw1667569/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2007,jdesando,," It may turn out to be the best comedy of the summer.
","A girl being ""knocked up"" in the past was as bad as a girl not having a cell phone today. The big A was not an acceptable remedy, and social rejection was pretty much routine.",/review/rw1667569/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2007,B_D,6," Decent, but I don't see what all of the fuss is about.
","I went into the theater not knowing what to expect, not having seen the trailer, and two hours later I felt I had seen a decent movie, quite funny at times, but I couldn't figure out what everyone was making such a big deal about. Compared to a lot of what passes for comedy in the cinema these days, Knocked Up is great, but it's hardly the ""instant classic"" that I've seen it called in many professional and IMDb reviews. It's certainly worth seeing, but maybe at a discount matinée instead of a full-price evening show.",/review/rw1667569/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2007,claudiaeilcinema,9," Young America In The Eternal City
","As I lived part of my life in the US, both coasts. I was able to read between the lines of the dubbed-into-Italian breakthrough Judd Apatow comedy and laugh. Most people dismissed it at the movie theater in Rome where I saw it. Thought it was vulgar and old hat. Vulgar? The Italians of the Massimo Boldi comedies thought it was vulgar?! ""Knocked Up"", besides making me laugh out loud and amusing me no end taught me a really important cultural lesson. We, in Italy, ride a very high (non existent) horse. I think the time has come for us to get off the horse and start looking at ourselves for what we really are - like we used to in Dino Risi, Pietro Germi and Mario Monicelli's films. ""Knocked Up"" is ultra sophisticated and yet, it reached a vast audience in the States because the sophistication is so amazingly smart. Seth Rogen is a real find. His eyes when he realizes Katherinre Heigl is going to stay with him that first and fatal night made me fall in love with his unlikely character. Katherine Heigl is another incredible discovery. Superb and stunning and classy to boot. Now, all this praise and I haven't even seen it in its original English version. I can't wait.",/review/rw1667569/?ref_=tt_urv

13 May 2009,kirk-246,8," Judd Apatow is simply a genius
","I liked Judd Apatow's first comedy,'The 40-Year Old Virgin'.When it comes to comedy,Judd knows exactly how to make people laugh until they beg him to make another movie.'Knocked Up'isn't just funny.It's a smart and refreshing movie that actually teaches a lesson:make sure you wear a condom when you have sex with a woman.But if you want a child,then do whatever that floats in your mind.The one thing that I probably dislike about the movie is it's running time.Even you probably wouldn't want to watch a really funny movie that lasts 129 minutes.But its definitely worth it when it comes to 'Knocked Up' and Judd Apatow.Grab some popcorn,get some friends,and laugh your butt off at this funny and brilliant comedy if you haven't already.",/review/rw1667569/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2007,joe_lvn,1," Hard to figure out how any critic would give this a good review.
","Basically, this was a sophomoric and very clichéd film with revolting toilet humor passing for comedy. And there really wasn't very much of this so-called ""comedy"" in the film. This was more of a dramatic movie. It might have been better played totally straight with much more originality. (I thought marijuana jokes kind of faded out with the 1970's). These ""adults"" acted more like children than children (as the song goes). And that also includes Katharine Heigl's character and the actress who played her bitch of a sister. Even when Seth Rogen supposedly becomes a ""mature"" man as the movie goes on, it's hard to really believe he will make a one hundred eighty degree turnaround in his ways.

7 October 2007,Mtrodgers99,1," I can't understand the rating of 7.9
","I can count on one hand the number of movies that I could not watch all the way through. This is one of them. The vulgarity of the main character and all of his buddies was so over the top as to be totally unbelievable; beyond even the realm of fantasy. I think I can tolerate a fair bit of this sort of stuff, but the movie exceeded my threshold. The only way the writers could have made this gang of misfits any less appealing would have been to make them criminals. I stopped watching soon after the lead female character decided to keep the baby; a decision that was totally unrealistic given her new career as a television interviewer. The idea that a woman like her would have anything to do with a guy like that was simply ludicrous. I thought this was going to be a good comedy, but excessive vulgarity isn't funny, it's just vulgar.",/review/rw1667569/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2007,mummy99,5," Did not live up to the previews
","My 17 year old daughter and I had been looking forward to the release of this movie for quite some time and we went on opening day. Both of us like Katherine Hiegl and we were looking forward to a witty, funny film. Instead, we both thought that there was a negative edge to all of the humor that relentlessly followed the cast of characters from scene to scene. The main male and his friends were all unkempt slackers and it was hard to find something to like about them. The drug use was annoying and excessive - are there adults out there who really behave like this? Every negative stereotype about pregnant women and women not accepting their aging gracefully had to be dragged into the plot. The one nice male seemed to love his spouse but was unable to communicate his interests or feelings toward her and seemed like such a wimp. Even the two studio executives were tired stereotypes that denigrate women. Did the characters really have to be so cynical and negative? With the exception of the two sisters, it didn't seem like any of the characters really liked each other or really wanted to be around the others. I think the excessive drug use and nasty attitude toward sex was annoying. It is interesting to see that both males and females under 45 are rating this film very closely and much higher than both males and females over 45. It's certainly not a movie that we will see again.",/review/rw1667569/?ref_=tt_urv
