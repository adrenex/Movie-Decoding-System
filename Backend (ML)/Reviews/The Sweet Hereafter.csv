22 April 2016,Gordon-11,," What an intense adventure!
","This film tells the story of two German citizens who are in Chile under Pinochet dictatorship. They get locked up in a camp of a religious sect, and get mistreated, abused and tortured. ",/review/rw3511174/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2016,siderite,8," Yes, people actually do that and others fall for that, just like in the movie
","The film attempts to spin a thriller story inside the larger and more important history of Colonia Dignidad, a torture, rape and death place run like a religious cult by a pedophile Nazi ex-nurse preacher in collaboration with both the Chilean and German authorities. It sounds corny, yet it's true. Before and during the brutal military dictatorship of Pinochet in Chile, this guy ran the colony for 33 years, only being accused, then running away, then being caught and convicted... at 84 years old, much too late for anything. His right hand man is still living in Germany, close to his many victims that returned home, because the German constitution forbids deportation of its citizens.",/review/rw3511174/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2016,dave-mcclain,8," ""Colonia"" takes a little-known chapter in history and spins it into an interesting and entertaining tale of romance and danger.
","A religious cult in Chile run by ex-Nazis?!? It may sound like a bizarre work of fiction, but the location portrayed in the historical drama ""Colonia"" (NR, 1:50) was all too real (except for the fictional romance at the center of the film). But before I get into my plot summary, I think that a little historical context is in order: In September 1973, a U.S.-backed military coup wrested control of the government of Chile from democratically-elected socialist president Salvador Allende and placed power in the hands of army commander-in-chief Augusto Pinochet. Under his 17-year rule, dissidents were persecuted, arrested, kidnapped, deposed, tortured and murdered. Pinochet's government used the remote Colonia Dignidad (Colony of Dignity) as a place to torture and murder some of the regime's political opponents. The public face of the colony was that of a charitable and educational organization. It was actually a religious cult where former Nazi medic Paul Schäfer imposed a strict Baptist interpretation of the Bible on all of his followers, many of who had emigrated with him from Germany. He forced them to live in dormitories segregated by gender, and with parents separated from their children, whom Schäfer sexually molested.",/review/rw3511174/?ref_=tt_urv

13 April 2016,Horst_In_Translation,8," A triumph in relevant storytelling
","""Colonia"" or ""Colonia Dignidad"" is a German English-language movie that premiered last year, but hit cinemas mostly this year, in 2016. It runs for slightly under 2 hours and was written and directed by Florian Gallenberger. Gallenberger won an Oscar in the short film category and has not really been that prolific in the last 15 years since then. And his films always had a foreign impact since then, such as ""John Rabe"" for example. And just like his Oscar-winning effort, this one here has some Spanish parts as well. It is about a young couple in Chile in the Pinochet years. The political background is elaborated on in the first parts of the film, but the heart and soul are really all the scenes taking place directly at Colonia Dignidad. The characters there also play a much bigger role than the supporting characters early on, the friends of the couple.",/review/rw3511174/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2016,t-dooley-69-386916,6," Fact based story of one of Chile's dark secrets
","Set in the early 1970's amidst the political turmoil that beset Chile at the time, we meet a German political activist – Daniel played by Daniel Brühl. His girlfriend is an air hostess, this is Lena played by the wonderful Emma Watson. Then Pinochet and his army take over the democratically elected socialist Government; this was obviously with US backing.",/review/rw3511174/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2016,cinemacy,7," Sacrificial torture and secret worlds, there is no shortage of surprises in 'Colonia'
","Inspired by true events, Colonia is a Hollywood-style thriller about a couple who finds themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time- the torture prison of a religious cult under the influence of the Chilean secret police in 1974. At a time when Chilean youth began revolutionizing in the streets, one man's involvement with the movement along with his girlfriend's association in his anti-government views causes the couple to put their relationship and love for each other to the test. Directed by Academy Award winner Florian Gallenberger (Shadows of War), Colonia opens in theaters Friday, April 15th. Bill Withers' ""Ain't No Sunshine"" accompanies archival footage of protesters rioting in the streets while the film itself is saturated in prime colors- magenta and royal blue. This juxtaposition of violence and R&B gives an artistic edge to the film's opening scenes, but unfortunately, this visual isn't sustained throughout the film. We meet our protagonist Daniel (Daniel Brühl), up on stage pumping up the masses of people, when, out of nowhere, he spots a bright yellow flight attendant's outfit (like a ray of Mr. Withers' sunshine) from the muted colors of the crowd. The woman is Lena (Emma Watson) and they immediately embrace. Their relationship isn't made entirely clear, but she only has four days in town and they plan on spending it together.",/review/rw3511174/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2015,SauturNuss,9," Not a mere thriller, but a movie with contents
","I've been to the premiere at the Film Festival in Zurich and I was moved by the movie, not because of the love story, but because of the irrefutable truth. The movie left me thinking and researching about its topic: Colognia Dignidad, a cult in Santiago de Chile. It conjures many ethical questions and portrays what humanity is capable of. The movie grips and doesn't let go of you till the end. The contents is real, except for the love story that forms the golden thread. One has to imagine that the movie portrays the life and the ways of Colognia Dignidad almost like a documentary without felt exaggeration, but it is still a movie with a story. Superb acting by Emma Watson and Daniel Brühl made the movie an even more intense experience. The only criticism I can make is that the love story is average in comparison to the rest. I believe that the characters actions don't always make much sense. All in all, it's one of the best movies I've seen this year and cannot be compared with the commercial films normally shown in cinemas.",/review/rw3511174/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2017,deloudelouvain,9," A story that has to be told
",Well i guess I learned something new today by watching a movie. I never heard of Colonia Dignidad before and now that I have I wonder how the hell I never heard about that scandalous and disgusting sect before. I started watching Colonia without any expectations and without any clue what it was going to be about. It all started really promising and the further the movie went on the more disturbed I was by it. Not in a bad way though because I really liked this movie. It's just because the movie is based on true facts and that makes you realize how some people are just not worth living on this planet. How you can be so evil and get away with it for years is beyond my comprehension. Now for the acting itself I thought Emma Watson did a really good job. As well as Michael Nyqvist that's playing the ultimate disgusting human being Paul Schäfer. The other actors are all good as well. The story is really captivating and you really hope for a good ending for the entire movie. To me Colonia is one of the better movies I saw lately.,/review/rw3511174/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2016,stanrogersmith,8," Pleasant Surprise
","Stumbled across this title. Looked interesting. Gave it a shot and was pleased with what I watched. Not knowing a single thing about the movie or the real history behind it, I went into this thinking it was going to be about something totally different. I was even surprised when at the beginning I saw the name ""Emma Watson"". I knew good things were gonna happen. So as it unfolded, I thought it was gonna be some political thriller where the boyfriend gets kidnapped by the army goons and then he has to escape. Imagine my surprise when it took a turn to Chilean/Deutschland Jonestown!!! Didn't see that coming! The old hag nazi b!tch was excellent. You just knew right away that you wanted her to get clubbed over the head with a blunt object. Thanks Emma for granting my wish. I didn't care for the love story, but it drove the film. Anyhow, I don't want to give anything away, just suffice to say - this is worth your time watching!",/review/rw3511174/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2016,saartjee-63814,9," This movie is worth a solid 9/10
",I was holding my breath from beginning to end. This movie is so exciting from the minute it starts a real thriller with a damn good story. I enjoyed it and definitely recommend watching it. It really is worth your time and chapeau to Emma for this performance! Also it is a real eyeopener that there is so much going on in the world that we (I) am not aware of. The way they portrait it in this movie is just excellent without over doing it. The actor Daniel also is really really good his performance is magnificent. I think there should be a lot more movies with the purpose to make people aware of what is going on in this film. It is definitely not boring in the slightest way and you wont regret watching it!,/review/rw3511174/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2020,kluseba,9," Let the truth be known
","Colonia Dignidad was the German equivalent to Jonestown. It was an isolated cult led by a megalomaniac pedophile fugitive who collaborated with Chilean dictator Pinochet for decades. Neither German ambassador officials nor members of the Pinochet regime were ever hold accountable for the abominable crimes against humanity such as imprisonment, torture and murder that happened there for several decades. The worst thing is that there still is a colony called Villa Baviera that has taken Colonia Dignidad's place. That whole area has become some sort of sinister tourist attraction and people claim that hotel staff is friendly and the restaurant offers great meals. It's outrageous that this place even exists under any other form than a memorial. People who have lost their relatives should be able to grieve here like people who visit concentration camps. Even tearing this whole place down like it happened to Jonestown would still be a better option than what this place has become now. The existence of this place alone until this date is a slap in the face for victims and survivors alike. Germany and Chile should cooperate to shut this place down as soon as possible, start a thorough investigation of the gloomy past and create a humble memorial that educates present and future generations about the horrors that happened there.",/review/rw3511174/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2020,muamba_eats_toast,9," Intensely enjoyable despite missing key points.
",I thought the film was actually pretty great Emma Watson and Daniel Bruhl worked together a lot better than I expected! The film was intense throughout and whilst it missed out a lot of the horrors that went on within the colony it is likely through the eyes of the 2 characters given how separated they were that they would not have seen the child abuse so it is not a problem for me as this is not a depiction of Paul Schaefer but of this couple. Highly enjoyable and would recommend.,/review/rw3511174/?ref_=tt_urv

12 August 2016,kosmasp,7," Interesting and full of emotion
","If you want a tense movie you could do more than worse than picking this one. One that is rooted in real life incidents and happenings of course, but also one that might have heightened a few things that actually happened to make it more ""movie-like"". So this also makes a couple of things more than predictable.",/review/rw3511174/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2018,areatw,4," Shallow, predictable thriller filled with clichés and genre stereotypes
","For a film that is supposedly based on a true story, 'Colonia' has the feel of a cheap thriller with a very shallow and underdeveloped plot. The story itself sounds interesting enough and it definitely had the potential to be an engaging and fascinating film, but the on screen execution is really poor, heavy handed and sloppily written in parts. To say that this film is overdramatic would be an understatement and it is riddled with clichés and predictable events.",/review/rw3511174/?ref_=tt_urv

13 September 2017,robertemerald,10," A profoundly disturbing true horror movie based on historical fact.
","Make no bones about it, this is an edge of your seat horror movie. It is also highly original. I can't think of another movie that comes close to comparing with it. That such originality is based on fact is highly disturbing on its own. I've seen movies that deal with similar subject matter but this is in a class above. If you really want to enjoy it, or offer the experience to others to enjoy, then go into it as blind as possible. I only grabbed it because I think Emma Watson is a fine actress and I like good political/historical thrillers. I got that from the DVD cover, which was the first I'd heard of it, and bought it. Within ten minutes of putting it on I was literally glued. I had to take a break half way through as the tension was unbearable. It twists and turns, surprises often, sets your teeth on edge, hits your emotions and scares the hell out of you at the same time for a solid eighty minutes. The heroes are so real and brave and understated. The villains are so horrible. This is classic movie making and will probably remain at the cutting edge of its genre long after we're all gone.",/review/rw3511174/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2017,zkonedog,7," True Nature Gives It The Gravitas It Needs To Be Successful
","If one were to judge ""Colonia"" purely on face value, it would be an average film. It jumps around a bit, doesn't have a clear narrative, and doesn't really even have all that much resolution. When you consider that it is based on true events, however, it needs to be judged in that capacity. With that in mind, ""Colonia"" becomes a much more experience considering they had to keep somewhat on track with the real life events.",/review/rw3511174/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2016,qeter,7," Refreshing
","Yes, somehow ""Refreshing"" seems to be the wrong word as a summary for such a movie. But, after a day in (my) work - after trying to convince other people at my working place for years to live a more solidarity, more human way with colleagues, by trying that, showing over years a good role model by myself. And yesterday, going out of the working place with the knowledge that nothing has helped - my colleagues still only interested in their own careers, without any empathy for the weak. Nothing can be changed in peoples hearts and minds after they have grown out of their childhood. And then, living in Europe, and recognizing that all politics - from left to right - get's sick and more xenophobic from day to day with the refugee-crisis fueled by inhuman politics... Yes, then such a movie is terrible refreshing. Here a writer, a director, a camera man, a cast prove that at least they care. If I would have a daughter like Emma Watson or a son like Daniel Bruhl I would be immensely proud. Yes it is acting. But, never-the-less you can see and feel - both of them care. It is highly sensible acting. A political statement in itself. Very glad, that my day ended with that relief. There are still some people out there, who care. Thanks, for that great movie. Thanks, for hope.",/review/rw3511174/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2016,leonblackwood,5," Intriguing storyline! 5/10
","Review: I found it quite amazing that this movie was based on true events, because the controlling leader of the colony, Paul Schafer (Michael Nyqvist) really had some warped rules, which went way over the top. The photos of the real Chilean colony were touching and the fact that Lena (Emma Watson) and Daniel (Daniel Bruhl), went through so much to escape from the horrendous conditions, made the movie quite intense towards the end. Lena's love for her boyfriend was truly emotional, and I couldn't believe that no one was willing to help her to find Daniel, who went through unimaginable torture, just because he was protesting and taking photos. Personally, I wouldn't have picked Emma Watson to play Lena, because she lacked emotion and I didn't really feel the intensity of her character but Daniel Bruhl played his Daniel extremely well. Michael Nyqvist and Richenda Carey, who played Gisela, we're pretty scary throughout the movie, so I have to commend them for there performance but there wasn't much depth to the characters because the storyline jumps from a happy couple in bed, to a couple split apart, living in a cult. Anyway, I found the story intriguing and I couldn't help rooting for the couple who were in the wrong place at the wrong time but it needed more emotion. Watchable!",/review/rw3511174/?ref_=tt_urv
