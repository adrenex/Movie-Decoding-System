28 March 2000,thehumanduvet,10," I'll show you the life of the mind...
","I am absolutely amazed at the fantastic taste of the imdb readership, having loved this film for years and always been told by people I'd told about it and persuaded to watch that it was no good, I finally find some other people out there who love it as much as me, posting (mostly) extremely positive comments...This is a fabulous film, dripping with a brooding, sticky atmosphere that draws you in to the clammy world of Barton Fink, sat in his hotel room listening to the creaking of the wallpaper as it dribbles moistly from the walls, searching for inspiration in his tacky painting and dusty typewriter...Perhaps it is a little dark for some tastes, but as black comedy goes this is the blackest and the most biting there is, the Hollywood system and New York theatrical snobbery lampooned with equal viciousness. Deep insight into the nature of the creative spirit, a plethora of fine performances bringing at first stereotypical characters to full life (despite the unreal, fable-like atmosphere created by the slimy, glistening colours reminiscent of the films of Jeunet&Caro...), and many moments of hilarity make this a perfect movie, one I would not hesitate in recommending to anyone despite the fairly high probability they will hate it. A lack of any underlying morality, an absence of absolutes of right and wrong, good and bad, give this film a unique feeling that it could go anywhere. The last twenty minutes are about the most powerful I have ever seen in anything, at the end of almost every scene I thought it could end there and be an amazing film, yet each further scene only added further depth and poignancy. The first time I saw it, it left me drained, mind spinning, hands shaking, barely able to reach for the remote to rewind it to watch it again...",/review/rw0291145/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2003,funkyfry,10," Classic dark comedy spoofs Hollywood hacks, literati alike
","This is a satire which really eviscerates its main character, nebbish Barton Fink, a semi-successful, very Jewish New York playwright who comes to Hollywood to make his dreams come true, which in his case is definately not writing the next Wallace Beery wrestling picture.  There are just too many funny things in this movie to mention them all, so I won't mention any.  But this is a movie that is going to stand up to the test of time; it may be the Coen brothers' best movie, because it is both dead funny and dead serious.",/review/rw0291145/?ref_=tt_urv

28 August 2003,tarzana311,," Writer who doesn't want to see
","This is my first time to comment on a film on this site. I have enjoyed reading y'all's comments. After 4 viewings, I found peace with the mysteries I saw in the film. Barton, though he talks a good show about wanting to write about ""the common man"", doesn't see anything around him as worthy of being a subject. He fears learning about the common man, or anything else outside his experience. His experience  teems with material for a watchful writer, but Barton sees nothing. When the wallpaper peels, he doesn't look for what's underneath or an explanation, he feverishly tries to cover up what's ""exposed"" as fast as he can (uno metaphoro). I agree with all comments about Goodman presenting Barton with a ""common man"" right in his own room. He has a research subject to learn from and to use as a springboard to break through his ""writer's block"", but he can't see anything that ""god"" presents for him to use. And the Woman on the Beach. Interesting that he never sees her face. He can never really SEE her but seems drawn to her and fascinated by her. He is drawn to the fact that she is ""unseeable"". In the end he ""sees"" her and doesn't explore that possibility either. The Box? He never opens it. We assume what we want to assume, but Barton, who is in control (!) simply attaches to the box without ever ""discovering"" it. He is all show and no substance. I agree, his one hit (the play) may be all he has in him. He's a one-trick pony posing as a seeking writer, intent on revealing the inner ""common man"" but is petrified by fear, ignorance or what-you-will. Look at the film again with an eye to his inability to ""see"" what is clearly revealed to him. you may ""see"" what I mean! Cheers!",/review/rw0291145/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 1999,Rumples,7," Memorable, disturbing, and very Coen-esque!
","I'm still not entirely sure what to think of this film. One thing is sure, it won't be easy to forget. This movie is clearly the product of a writer who has struggled with their muse, and equally one who has a healthy mistrust of Hollywood - the sausage grinder. Although Hollywood has been critiqued in film before in similar ways, memorable scenes, clever dialogue, quality acting, and a surreal plot and setting, add together to make this an unusual and different film. Maybe another viewing might add a different dimension. This is by no means 'light entertainment' and it leaves plenty of questions unanswered. But on the whole, an intelligent movie, if something of an enigma. My vote 7/10",/review/rw0291145/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2010,Hitchcoc,9," John Goodman, Forevery!
","I knew I was entering the world of the insane when I picked this up. I wasn't disappointed. This is a dark comedy where people don't talk to each other, they just talk. Barton Fink is a big phony one hit wonder. He has these high ideals which he really doesn't understand. He's unable to see the forest for the trees. When he meets John Goodman's character, Charlie, he has an opportunity to find his muse, but he doesn't even listen. When he does, it's too late. The events of this film are wonderful, from Barton's speeches and his block. To Mayhew, the ersatz Faulkner, who drinks constantly and screeches. Barton Fink is so unlikeable that we don't even care what happens to him in other than a casual way. Goodman steals every scene he is in and ends up so much more that originally thought. This is a movie about taking everything to a higher pitch. It's about the artist and the dilettante. It's about the movies being a purely commercial enterprise. Wallace Beery is the king of the screen. It's a wrestling movie. For God's sake, they're asking for so little. Barton Fink is a whiny loser and he pays the price. The Coens are, without a doubt, the most refreshing thing of the last two decades.",/review/rw0291145/?ref_=tt_urv

24 June 2017,filipemanuelneto,5," Difficult to understand but the perfect portrait of the gap between the common public and the minds of the intellectuals.
","This is probably one of the most hermetic, personal and autobiographical films that the Coen Brothers have ever presented. Many people find it boring. I understand and I can even agree but I also believe that I understand, at least in part, what the directors wanted to tell us.",/review/rw0291145/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," It feels like the Coens were struggling with as much writer's block as Barton Fink himself.
","Some individual scenes in 'Barton Fink (1991)' are great, emphasising the Coen's philosophy that the scene takes precedent over the story, and there's a chunk just after the halfway point where things really pick up steam and a proper 'plot' seems to be getting underway - until the film just ends without any real satisfying resolution, that is. For most of the run-time, though, this off-kilter 'comedy'-drama lacks drive and instead meanders around through ponderously aloof satirical sequences in which the protagonist pretentiously proposes that his writing must come from a source of pain and how that's more important than critical acclaim or audience acceptance. It's frustrating that there seems to be some hints of a sub-layer to the narrative, indications that perhaps something supernatural is going on beneath the surface or that we're going to get a big 'reveal' in the third act that makes sense of some of the stranger moments (or at least cements the necessity of their inclusion), but though there is a 'twist' of sorts that slips a slice of sinister into the otherwise lukewarm narrative, these hints and this plot point peel away to surmount to nothing and, as such, seem like hollow inclusions only added to infuse a false sense of depth to a hopelessly shallow narrative. This seemingly indicates that the Coens themselves fell victim to the writer's block that consistently aisles their bespectacled creation. 6/10",/review/rw0291145/?ref_=tt_urv

","Barton Fink is a playwright, the new darling of Broadway, who gets a tempting offer to write for a Hollywood studio. Reluctantly, he agrees, but when he is assigned a wrestling picture, he finds he is completely blocked up. With a deadline looming, can he come up with a good story ?",/review/rw0291145/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2006,lee_eisenberg,7," Hell-ywood
","""Barton Fink"" is, in my opinion, probably the Coen brothers' weirdest movie ever. Portraying the playwright title character (John Turturro) getting called to LA in 1941 to write a movie script and experiencing several strange things while suffering writer's block, they let out all the stops here. I should identify that although we usually expect unusual things from the Coen brothers, this is beyond bizarre. Of course, it is very likely that they're just showing how hellish Hollywood is (how many movies have shown that?). But that bug, plus Charlie Meadows (John Goodman), plus the picture on the wall - and of course the end scene - all add up to something really far out. What does it all add up to? I don't know, but the movie is worth seeing. Just be forewarned, this is not really an ""easy"" movie (well duh, it's a Coen brothers movie). Also starring Michael Lerner, Judy Davis, John Mahoney, Steve Buscemi and Tony Shalhoub.",/review/rw0291145/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2000,Mort-31,10," A masterpiece of surrealism
","The Coen-movie I liked best was ""Raising Arizona"". But being realisic, I know that ""Miller's Crossing"" and ""Barton Fink"" were better. There is so much inside and behind this movie, it's impossible to refer to every single detail. John Turturro has never given a better performance than here, as arrogant, too ambitious author Barton Fink. John Goodman also plays his role for a lifetime. And of course, Michael Lerner was nominated for an Academy Award. The reason why he still is no star is that he didn't act in any other Coen-brothers-movie. It's a fact that with their direction actors reach their climax.",/review/rw0291145/?ref_=tt_urv

","Easy to watch, difficult to assimilate, Joel and Ethan Coen's penchant for self-reverence, self-amusement and self-loathing reaches a new peak. Playwright from N.Y.C. comes to Hollywood and suffers a block while working on his first screenplay. John Turturro is uneven as Barton Fink, but it's not his fault, it's in the writing (Fink isn't a consistent creation); John Goodman is amazing as an insurance salesman and Michael Lerner shines as movie mogul. But the writing is disappointing, the culmination of events sour, with details that don't come to fruition. Yes, that may be the whole point, but even puzzle movies should have some sort of pay-off, either visceral or emotional or tangible.

10 December 2007,classicsoncall,9," ""It's a goddam B picture, big men in tights, you know the drill.""
","I couldn't help thinking during the fiery hallway scene that this in fact represented Barton Fink's own self imposed exile into the confines of hell, if not willingly, at least metaphorically in keeping with his original mission. You see, Fink (John Turturro) was in Hollywood to capitalize on his hit stage play success, only to fall victim to the 'common man', read that 'lowest common denominator' syndrome. Could there be anything lower than coming up with a wrestling film for Wallace Beery? He actually did one you know, 1932's ""Flesh"", but that's another story.",/review/rw0291145/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ever since the day those brave pioneers came out west from the east coast with dreams of sunshine and perfect weather conditions for making movies, that ideal known as Hollywood (not the place, but the state of mind) has dashed many hopes and dreams. Whether it be for the phoniness of the people, lack of artistic respect of how movies are made and the absence of creative aspects has turned off many artists. Writers have exposed the shady world of filmmaking, both in California and abroad, and when Hollywood does it and gets away with it, it is practically a work of genius.",/review/rw0291145/?ref_=tt_urv

","New York playwright Barton Fink lives in his own personal Hell. Whilst he purports to be the voice of the Common Man  of the two-bit salesmen and the fishmongers  he is not one himself. He presents other with the illusion of modesty, but he's knows that he's good at what he does and he loves to hear it. Barton claims to be a spokesman for the working-class, but his time is too important to be concerned with anything they have to say. Indeed, throughout the film, we hardly even meet any of these people whom Barton is said to represent  with the exception of his disruptive neighbour Charlie Meadows (played brilliantly by John Goodman), who turns out to be something more than a lousy insurance salesman.",/review/rw0291145/?ref_=tt_urv

29 April 2005,evanston_dad,3," A Miss from the Coen Brothers
","For me, there are two kinds of Coen brothers films: the John Turturro movies, and the Frances McDormand movies. The only Coen brothers movies I like are the Frances McDormand films: ""Fargo,"" ""Blood Simple,"" ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" ""Miller's Crossing."" The movies I've hated include ""Barton Fink,"" ""The Big Lebowski,"" and ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" You may have noticed that the categories I've assigned these films to does not depend on whether or not McDormand or Turturro are actually in them (and in at least one case, they're both in the same movie) but rather on the movie's tone. McDormand movies feel elegant and profound; the Coens are able to balance their obvious love of the macabre and bizarre with stories that carry with them an emotional significance. Turturro movies, on the other hand, are unpleasant and ugly, the stories feel arbitrary and glib and the Coens seem to be laughing at jokes only they understand.",/review/rw0291145/?ref_=tt_urv

","I liken the Coen brothers to Haagen-Daz ice cream, i.e., various stages of good.  I would argue this dark film, laden with more allegories than Dante, is not their best...but, it's good, damn good.  To begin with, stellar performances form Turturro, Goodman, Mahoney, Buscemi and Lehner.  The thing I find amazing is the skill in bringing so much darkness to such a bright, colorful cinemagraphic work-- remindful of Ingmar Bergman's Cries and Whispers, in that regard-- that teeters on the edge.  Goodman's last scene walking into the burning hotel room is eerie but very bright (why not?  The damn place is burning down.)
