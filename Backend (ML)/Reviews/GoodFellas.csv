21 February 2010,gavin6942,9," The First Great Franchise of the Twenty-First Century
","Two seemingly unrelated people (Cary Elwes and Leigh Whinnell) wake up in a secluded, dingy bathroom, chained to the wall. With nothing but their wits, a few clues, and a hacksaw, they must figure out who put them in their predicament and how to get out. Well, assuming they're able to get out. For an added bonus, one of the men has a kidnapped family on the outside.",/review/rw0953953/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2008,MaxBorg89,9," The game begins
","Not since Se7en's John Doe has there been a serial killer with such a bizarre philosophy behind his actions (not that Jigsaw actually kills anyone; more on that later). Sure, in light of the increasingly deteriorating sequels it's hard to think of Saw as little more than a franchise- starter (something the writer and director never planned), but viewed on its own, astonishing merits, it's a good, nasty thriller, filled with solid scares and (especially compared to the follow-ups) quite well written.",/review/rw0953953/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2005,Superunknovvn,7," The best thriller in years
","Since ""Nattevagten"" I have not seen a thriller that has kept me on the edge of my seat as well as ""Saw"". Right from the beginning this original story sucks you in and doesn't let you go until the very end. Thrillers as gripping as this one have become extremely rare in times like these, where people have seen almost everything and can guess any twist during the first half of the movie. With ""Saw"" James Wan and Leigh Whannell, the creative heads behind this project, set new standards. Think you're hard-boiled? Think again and watch ""Saw"", a movie that will creep you out and surprise you beyond your expectations.",/review/rw0953953/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2005,dee.reid,8," I +Saw+ it last night
","""Saw,"" a film that was originally planned for a straight-to-video release but after receiving positive nods at test screenings, was finally given the green light in October 2004 - just in time for Halloween. ""Saw"" contains one of the those plots that shows you everything it's got up its sleeve, then doubles-back on itself three-fourths of the way through and reveals something entirely new.",/review/rw0953953/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2004,drownsoda90,9," One of the Most Unique and Grisly Thrillers In Recent Memory.
","""Saw"" is one of the better horror films in recent memory. I suppose it's more of a thriller than horror, although it still is gory and serves well on a horrific level. It's sort of a cross between ""Se7en"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" I'd say, and the film is pretty damn good. ",/review/rw0953953/?ref_=tt_urv

10 February 2005,dhruvdude,10," I loved it
","Movies like Saw are the ones that makes us believe in the horror genre. It is because of such movies we like to see horror/thriller movies. Let me tell you that after watching Saw I wanted to buy the ticket and watch it again because after a long time I got to see a real gripping and tightly directed horror movie. The movie is very exciting and has a lot of goosebumps. However, if you are a faint of heart please do not see this movie as it has a lot of gore/violence in it which will make you jump out of your seat. I just can't wait for the DVD to come out as I really want to buy it. My recommendation to all of you is to watch Saw and have a good time like I did. Also, the movie has a great twist. 10/10",/review/rw0953953/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2021,skrstenansky,6," Very good
","This movie is a very good and one of the best thrillers and one of the most interesting and tense ones. Very unique story line and extremely tense and entertaining, it kept me guessing what is going on and how are things going to go. Very well done story and directing, good acting, great effects, and a great twist. Very well done and entertaining.",/review/rw0953953/?ref_=tt_urv

7 March 2005,nycritic,6," Takashi Miike and Giallo Films Channeled by way of David Fincher
","Once the extremely improbable ending comes any viewer will feel sucker-punched in what I believe resembles any David Fincher film, most notably SE7EN, with a Takashi Miike spin. Which doesn't detract that for the most part it's claustrophobic, depressing, bleak, and filled with a growing sense of stomach-turning dread as the omnipresence of an unseen killer comes through, making us known anyone could be killed at any given moment, if his plans are not carried out to his satisfaction. Plans that largely include doing something unspeakable to solve a puzzle and thus, be set free.",/review/rw0953953/?ref_=tt_urv

1 August 2007,KornFrog,10," The Most Clever Horror Movie Ever!
","Not only does this movie create an extremely tense atmosphere the moment it starts, it has plenty of gore and violence to bombard your eyes, not to mention that it has one of the best twists seen in any horror movie.",/review/rw0953953/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2011,shadowdreadblade,7," The first, the best!
","Okay, i have seen a lot of horror films. Saw was another one that i liked much. Saw 2,3,4...and so on were movies i disliked. The splatter was increasing for no apparent reason, the atmosphere and the whole set up and the feeling, that made the first a success, were all missing from the rest.",/review/rw0953953/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2008,kosmasp,9," They came, SAW and altered (Horror Movies)
","I haven't seen the original short movie yet (titles SAW as well), but with this feature length effort, a change has been made in Horror movie history. A new sub-genre was born (some call it ""gorno"", because of the explicit gore it has in it)! Many movies tried to copy the formula, but didn't have financial success. Saw on the other hand, is a brand name now. A 5th saw movie will come out later this year (and more are yet to come).",/review/rw0953953/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2005,jade_fine,," Sicko movie, Go!
","A sicko movie whose nastiness is almost topped by its weirdness...so obviously any true horror fan worth their salt needs to seek it out! The story is about a surgeon and a photographer who wake up and to find themselves shackled at opposite ends of a nasty-looking toilet. Don't want to say too much but plenty of ugliness ensues. This movie has the perfect mix of scares and a really bizarre plot. The movie's got a decent budget for an indie horror (a little over a million, i think) but it's pretty small for a film that got such a big release. I hear it made a ""killing"" at the box office, so TAKE NOTICE Hollywood! People want to see this stuff. Go!",/review/rw0953953/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have utmost respect for Wan. To my knowledge, he and his buddies were right out of film school. Instead of slowly building status by making mediocre films, he showed the world right from the get-go that he had something to prove.",/review/rw0953953/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2020,briancham1994,6," Better than it seems
","I'm not a fan of these sadistic horror movies so I didn't enjoy this film but I must admit it's better than it seems. There is a lot of exploration of the characters and backstory that leads up to the moment where they wake up in the bathroom. Not great, but definitely well crafted.",/review/rw0953953/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2004,lizabeth666,9," Well made horror/thriller, two thumbs up

25 August 2014,skybrick736,9," Saw
","The movie Saw is something that comes around every so often like the Blair Witch Project. A small budget film that gets tremendous buzz because it is done with such intelligent screen play and shock value. Saw is known for its incredible ending twist that no one saw coming and it blew all the audiences away. Aside from that the great characters, the acting and dialog is a little lackluster between the two leading men, Dr. Gordon and Adam. The writing, well thought out story and death trap scenes really put Saw over the top and being worthy of a great horror film. It was one of a kind until it came out and totally original that James Wan will be acknowledged for until the end of his directing days. Saw (9/10) is a creative, twisted low budget gem that is a can't miss.",/review/rw0953953/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2020,amullen34,8," Don't confuse this movie for its sequels- this one's actually good
","The Saw movies tend to get a pretty bad rap. Most people think of them as senselessly violent and overly gory torture fests with no actual interesting plots or characters. Granted, some of the movies are like that. But, when you watch this 2004 original, leave those expectations at the door, because this movie is just a genuinely good thriller and mystery.",/review/rw0953953/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2017,TheLittleSongbird,7," A puzzling game worth playing
","Finally saw all the 'Saw' films prior to seeing 'Jigsaw' (as part of my wanting to see as many 2017 films as possible this year, during a quieter and less intensive period). Heard a lot about the films, good and bad, but wanted to see them for myself to know what to expect.",/review/rw0953953/?ref_=tt_urv
