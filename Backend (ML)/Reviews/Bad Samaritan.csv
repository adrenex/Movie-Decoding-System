","Odd Thomas was a solid movie and it was indeed an enjoyable watch. I'm a pretty big fan of the Odd Thomas books. As with any novel turned into a movie there was much of the finer details left out and a few that were never there added in. I feel they did a fair job of capturing Odd's character. I do feel the chemistry between Odd and Stormy was a bit off. I'm not sure if this was due to the casting ,acting or direction. Or the fact that so much about her character was left out. But it felt more juvenile rather than deep love of your life love. I can't help but wonder if they had given it a slightly bigger budget and focused more on some of the other characters and their stories, it would have been a great movie, instead of merely a good one.

23 June 2013,shawn4004,8," Good Adaptation
","Firstly, I am a huge Koontz fan and a huge Odd Thomas fan. I've been waiting years for this movie so my expectations were pretty high. I'm sure that figures into my analysis of the movie, as I have been largely let down by adaptations from novels in the past. That being said...",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2013,steventot,9," A very Odd movie
","I will start with a recommendation: ""go watch it"". This movie is definitely worth seeing. I did not red the book , and this movie truly surprised me. The movie unfolds very dynamically. It is not a slow paced movie for sure. The story is also very interesting containing just enough elements to surprise and entertain at the same time. The ending is also done very nicely. The effects are not the best ever seen , but sufficient. The acting was also very good. I admit some of the characters felt a bit dull , not really believable. In a nutshell , go watch it and be amazed how good a movie can turn out even if you never heard of it.",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2013,minerva1961,8," MUCH better than I expected!
","Watched this with my 16 and 14 yr old sons last night and we all throughly enjoyed it, the 14yr old hid behind a pillow for quite a lot but really it was all standard 'turns around and ghost inches from your face' fare, the CGI was not budget - was really good actually and lots of it. The story was really engaging, acting was great from Odd and Stormy and great chemistry between them, you felt like they really were lovers. Nice plot twists, it's not going to be a blockbuster and win academy awards, almost as many plot holes as World World Z but it was much better than I expected, very enjoyable, no dull moments and this will be joining my DVD collection when it comes out for sure. The ending was very good... ",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2013,johnstonlehane,," Loved It
","Well I have read every book of Odd Thomas and I was worried about the movie adaptation , well I needn't of worried , it was fun great chemistry with the main actors , Willem Dafoe great as usual , the pacing was good , and the action scenes really good , OK so the ghost of Elvis is not in it , the sad thing is no cinema release that probably means no sequel and that's a damn shame as this was a great adaptation of Odd Thomas, I truly think this could have carried through a complete series of movies based on each book That said you never know the power of the fans , so fingers crossed there may be more Odd Thomas in the future",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2013,gabriel-gibin,8," Very well made adaptation for the screen - couldn't tell the difference from the book!
","If you read Odd Thomas, which fortunately I did, you will hopefully find this movie quite truthful to the book which is really great. Superb job from the screen writers. Really, the characters are perfect in the movie and I think there would be no one better than Dafoe to play the Chief!",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2021,sunlounge29,5," Feels more like a pilot...
","This movie feels more like a pilot for some sort of supernatural horror series. The CGI is ok, Anton Yelcin is a good lead and the basic premise leaves just enough room for some entertaining 45 minutes and maybe a red thread story throughout the episodes of season 1 and 2. It probably would have been cancelled after season 3 because you can't repeat the same story forever.",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2014,tieman64,," Bro, stop looking at my ghoul friend
","One of director Stephen Sommers' better films, ""Odd Thomas"" stars Anton Yelchin as Odd Thomas, a young man who is able to see and communicate with the dead. Structured as a detective movie, the film watches as Odd attempts to both solve crimes and prevent a horrific massacre.",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2013,utgard14,7," One of the Best Movies to Come Out in 2013
","Refreshing blend of supernatural mystery and superhero movies. One review here I read seemed to think less of the movie because it didn't follow the familiar formula of an angst-ridden young hero with lots of problems; an emo kid who is hated by all and longs for a girl he can never have. The same old tired Spider-Man knock-off stuff, in other words. I, for one, enjoyed the freshness of this movie. Here we have a character who deals not only with having a supernatural gift but also deals with death daily. He sees things no one should see. In 99.9% of stories written about anything even in this ballpark, the lead character would be wracked with self-pity and guilt, would have no stable relationships, and would have no sense of humor unless it was dipped in bitterness. He would also seldom bathe.",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2018,neil-476,8," Excellent
","Odd Thomas (first name Odd, surname Thomas) is a griddle cook in a small desert town. He is fated to be with the love of his life Stormy Llewellyn (a fortune-telling card told them so). He is also fated with being able to see the dead (while they have unfinished business and before they move on) and creatures called bodachs, harbingers of doom. And an explosion in the bodach population indicates that something awful is about to happen: can Oddie track in down and prevent it?",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2013,walter2-407-597390,10," Excellent translation from book to movie
","I have liked the Odd Thomas books since I first opened the initial book, and I often wondered what a movie of any of the stories would look like. While this film seems trapped in a legal quagmire that will probably prevent release any time soon, watching it was a total delight.",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2013,crystal_gordon11,10," I recommend this one.
","So, much to my surprise, I enjoyed this one. I was skeptical before viewing because of the log line but it really took me on a ride. It was funny, sweet, sad, a bit scary, and had action. The mystery kept me engaged and the love story was so sweet but not sappy at the same time. The dialogue was great. I think Stephen Sommers did an outstanding job on the screenplay. Not to mention, he also directed and produced it. Kudos to him. I was shocked and impressed. I actually wasn't expecting the last plot twist. I didn't think so many elements could come together in one film and create harmony but it did. The genre says mystery/thriller but I think mystery/romance/comedy/thriller/action would be better suited. Go watch it.",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2014,face-819-933726,9," Nothing odd about our Thomas. So much heart, just a joy to watch
","Truly just bubbling over with heart, this movie really took me away, and I could not have Enjoyed myself more. Odd Thomas is just such a perfectly developed character, and the people of his town, have formed such a wonderful symbiotic relationship with him. To imagine what that bond could build to is quite fun. This movie is smart, and suspenseful, with a great mystery floating through the main story that you would not expect to work with such an observant fellow, but it does all work, and it makes for a fun ride from start to finish. Great narration from Anton Yelchin, who I really had not been a big fan of until this picture. He gives Thomas the life that he needs the expressions are perfect, and all of the cast supporting him are excellent as well. I can not recommend this movie enough, there may not be enough big explosions, but I can not imagine this movie not keeping even the most fidgety viewer in their seat.",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2013,rhaynes1974,7," Fabulously Fresh and Funny
","Anton Yelchin is a very likable performer and Odd Thomas cashes in on his screen personality in spades. Stephen Sommers, who's been away from the directors chair for way too long, pens a witty and fresh screenplay that zips along and keeps the audience thoroughly entertained every step of the way.",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've read a few of the ""Odd Thomas"" novels by Dean Koontz, but regrettably I have not kept myself up to date with this series. So, while I have the advantage of knowing the story behind the movie, as compared to those who haven't read the ""Odd Thomas"" novels, it has been some time since I've read them. With that in mind, I'm not about to go into any detail about whether the movie was faithful to the novel or not.",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv

","I had no idea what this was going to be a very entertaining movie. It is locally released as ""Odd Thomas and the Army of Death"" with a terrible-looking poster showing a spider-like Dementor. It also had no big name stars in it to attract attention. I had pretty low expectations going in.",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2013,breaandmelsteele,10," Perfect Oddness
","We love the Odd Thomas Books so finding the movie was a huge treat! The movie follows the book exactly! I am surprised this movie wasn't better advertised. Great find! Watch it, even if you have not read the books, it may inspire you to read the others. I really hope they make more movies. The movie does seem a bit lower budget. Like a made for TV movie, but it has a great cast, and as I said it follows the books. They picked the perfect actor to play Odd. They also did a great job of bringing Pico Mundo to life. It all feels so much like the places described in the books. The movie has as much comedy, romance, action and horror as the books!",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv

23 June 2016,Kirpianuscus,," not only for the fans
","a film for fans of books. and for the admirers of Anton Yelchin who does a decent job in a real nice adaptation. and that is the basic motif to see Odd Thomas- the universe from the novel, in not bad manner, presented in a film who mix teenager love, monsters and a brave hero with special sense of humor. and the merit of Yelchin is significant for keep the rhythm and for the salvation of good sense in a film who easily could be absurd - the dialogues are not its best part - or prisoner of technology. but the result is honorable and the film is charming. the run, the courage, the mystery and the alternative to super heroes impose it as a seductive show. and that is the good point. because it is important to give an easy but smart film . so, not only for the fans of series. but, maybe, first for admire the admirable art of Anton Yelchin.",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2021,Stevieboy666,5," I'm surprised by all these glowing reviews
","Odd Thomas is a popular guy - he works as a cook, has a nice girlfriend called Stormy and can see dead people, a gift which he uses to help the police catch murderers. The late Anton Yelchin plays Odd, good actor, and Addison Timlin looks great as Stormy. Willem Dafoe should need no introduction to film fans. The movie starts off by being narrated by Odd, quite a common practice around this time, Zombieland being another example. Personally I am not a fan of this style. Odd Thomas is a combination of horror, comedy and romance but it is not terribly scary or funny, I found the romantic element to be the strongest (it could make an OK date movie). The ending is actually quite sad. Lots of CGI, again something that I'm not a big fan of. There's a lot of high scores for this movie but I found it to be pretty average, a once only watch.",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2014,The-Plague,7," In a small California town, a clairvoyant diner cook prepares for a massive tragedy he believes will soon occur.
","Anton Yelchin (Charlie Bartlett) is back in another thriller following the the remake of 'Fright Night' in which he starred in 2011. Yelchin dawns the role of Odd Thomas in this film adaptation of Dean Koontz's book of the same name. Odd, is for lack of a better term, an odd guy. He keeps his life as simple as possible by not owning a vehicle and taking a menial job as a short order cook at a diner, but that is only to balance out the complications that come with seeing dead people. Odd uses his abilities to serve and protect as some sort of supernatural sheriff, but when a strange man enters his diner surrounded by an unnaturally large group of bodachs (ghostly predators who feed on pain and destruction), Odd realizes that his town is in serious danger.",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2014,TheMarwood,3," Felt like an extended unaired pilot for a network TV series
","Over-lit, without so much as a hint of atmosphere and cheap looking - this looks like something meant for broadcast on network TV. The story is about as deep as a Goosbumps episode and the chase/fight within the first 15 minutes is so inept and long, you have to wonder if the producers demanded the addition and shot it themselves. The CG is pretty simplistic, but Sommers wisely doesn't over reach with complex effects - except for a large scale digital explosion, which looks like the effects house had about 25 minutes to simulate and render. Anton Yelchin is fine as the lead and Defoe is wasted in a throw away role that could have been played by anyone. Addison Timlin is absolutely horrendous as Stormy - the perfect, quirky hot girlfriend. She comes across like a demented 12 year old girl infatuated with her first boy. Despite being madly in love with each other, these two generate the heat of a snowball. The financiers refused to pony up $35 million for prints and advertising and it's not difficult to see why. This is not big screen material and throwing good cash at Odd Thomas would not make any of it's problems go away.",/review/rw3017550/?ref_=tt_urv
