",A very nice refreshing game you can play on your console without the wearisome drudgery of the online crap! Reminiscent of the Deadspace series this game kicks butt. Great plot and awesome game play. Very fun and challenging. Scary as hell too so don't play at nite. It has everything you can want...creatures and a wide array of weapons. You play this character that has to find his way tru 'hell' to access an escape route back to civilization. You are guided and prompted by another character as you make your way to escape the mutant infested distant moon that you crash landed on. The unexpected is riddled throughout the journey!!,/review/rw8751660/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2022,ayameofazuma,3," Combat is too sloppy!
","I really wanted to like this game. It looks great and the story is interesting. But the combat is so clunky and just straight up sloppy! It's impossible to reload your gun or heal during a boss fight because you get hit as soon as you try. You also can't turn and run away from the swarms of monsters that attack relentlessly to get some space between you for just a moment to reload. You can't reload and dodge at the same time. TwoHead is hard enough as is the second time around and then you get attacked from behind while fighting him as well. I didn't make it any further; I had to give up due to the poor combat. I play most games on Normal/Medium but I had to put this on Easy. A challenge is fine, but Easy in this game is more like Hard. I should be allowed to enjoy a game too...on a slightly easier setting if I have to quit because it's become impossible to me. Not everyone is a teen boy or young adult who argue that all these difficult games are just ""easy"" to them. I enjoyed Dead Space (same creators) and I enjoy some games that require some technique in their combat. But this game becomes too repetitive fighting the same exact monsters over and over and I just can't get past it's troublesome, clunky gameplay. And every time you die, the loading screen is ungodly long! It's getting a 1 because it's now a total waste of $70 for me as I'll never get to finish it! And I don't understand how it has such a high rating on here, as I've heard a lot of the same complaints I've made.",/review/rw8751660/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,vippinftw,2," If you wanted a reimagining of Dead Space, this is not it.
","If you wanted a reimagining of Dead Space, this is not it. This a thinly veiled action game with poor mechanics that games ten years ago had resolved.",/review/rw8751660/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2022,jamesschroll-41346,3," Disappointed with the game...and myself.
","Starting with the good points. 1. It's beautiful. Even on the ps4 it's still a really good looking game. 2. Voice actors spot on. They sound like they're genuinely in the situations they're in. 3. It is a great story in a fresh universe. They conglomerate bits and pieces of other sci-fi horrors into something original. It's all downhill after that. Gameplay is glitchy, mechanics sometimes fail, Game itself would hiccup and move back a couple steps. Had to restart a few times bc of things failing to proceed properly. Blue screened once. Game mechanics: dodging is trash. Reloading while dodging is impossible. Will randomly switch out your gun for melee weapon. The gun switching mechanic is an annoyance. Plot was extremely predictable. Worst however is just how linear the game was. Literally 0 side missions or exploration. Took me days to complete because I was either bored or upset with it. This game wasn't worth $60 let alone the $80 I blew for the bogus pre-ordered deluxe edition. 3 stars was me being generous for this overall atrocious game.",/review/rw8751660/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,gixxermac,7," Didn't miss the mark, but not fully on target.
","I rated this game a solid 7. I was really hoping for more space and less planet, but the whole prison planet thing is cool. The visuals are fantastic, story is good but feels rushed and predictable ""oh no... not the same thing happening again and again, who'da thunk it"", and gameplay is a bit chunky ""character movement is slow and robotic "" I can't stand the movement when crawling through vents, or squeezing through tight spaces- they take way too long- I went to the bathroom and popped a corn dog in the microwave waiting for my character to exit a tight squeeze area"". Combat needs a lot of help ""it's more methodical than anything"", and running isn't really running... it's more like a fast paced Sunday stroll in the park with grandma taking a 5 minute rest at every park bench"". It's also not as jump scary as Dead Space; I was really hoping for that. I think most of the horror aspect comes from when you need to run or get out of the way of something and it feels like you're walking in place waiting for grandma to figure out where she put her purse. Multiple times I was yelling at my character because he's too slow. I guess you just have to stay in super close quarters in combat. I'm sure the developers designed it that way though.",/review/rw8751660/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2022,izzodiego,8," Beautiful, fun and repetitive.
","Right of the bat I'll start by saying a had loads of fun playing this game. The combat is satisfying, the gore is truly next-gen and the story is solid. I don't think I need to say anything about the graphics because it speaks for itself.",/review/rw8751660/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,rivblue-32248,6," Great Plot, Fun game
","This game has a Story line that I'm into. I'm most of the way thorough but dang, this game is Tough. It takes a while to get the hang of. I gave this a 7 because I was hoping for more jaw dropping cinematic sequences. This game isn't very scary, but I'd call it survival horror. It really is a lot like Deadspace but not as scary. The Mechanics overall aren't that great and the action is pretty repetitive but it's hard to put the controller down. I'm a true story gamer and need to find out how this ends.",/review/rw8751660/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2022,savvie-81688,5," Watered down Dead Space
","I was so looking forward to this! It gave me The Thing and Alien vibes but it was a wannabe Dead Space. Not as much horror or variety of enemies as expected and what they did show was over too quickly. Gameplay even on normal seemed impossible at times and I wouldn't say it was worth the Â£50 price tag for 10 hours or less of gameplay. Plus give me NG+ on release if you're gonna do it, I'll have forgotten this by the time it comes out! Voice actors were great, story was a little weak but enjoyable although I hated not fully getting the backstory and leaving the ending wide open! Overall it was enjoyable but wouldn't rush to play again.",/review/rw8751660/?ref_=tt_urv

20 December 2022,merem1,7," it was good
","This game is pretty fun. I like the atmosphere of it with the setting inside a prison. The actors do an awesome job playing their characters. There are a couple of issues with the game though. It feels like something is missing with it. It could have been amazing. Still, it is an entertaining horror game with plenty of blood and guts. It really goes crazy with the gore through the experience, I enjoyed that. The weapons are pretty cool. The locations in the game look good. There were a couple of areas that I really liked. The game is worth playing for horror fans. The Callisto Protocol is a solid fun ride.",/review/rw8751660/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2022,saqibcreate-196-123761,10," Best game of the year!
",Just got it from steam and almost played 4+ hours. Its amazing. Everything what I was hopping for. Its a survival game style that everyone should adopt. Great artwork and story.,/review/rw8751660/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2022,matthiasbreinbauer,2," disappointing
","It is really badly balanced and very repetitive and **yawn** boring. The hard surface models, level-design and lighting are quite poor. But most of all, the game's responsiveness is a mess; as are the dodge- and traversal-mechanics. There seldom are smooth transitions from one action to another, instead it is a chain of animations that are not very well interconnected and therefore lead to annoying delays that have to be tolerated.",/review/rw8751660/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2022,saaiakani-822-89518,2," Poorly scaled, disappointingly unscary, tedious and worthless.
","As someone who loved Dead Space in every iteration and has beaten every one more than once, I was hoping for so much from this game. It's incredibly frustrating how much of a disappointment this game has been; I practically had to force myself to play. On Medium difficulty, some encounters are a cakewalk and some are hideously annoying; the makers of CP clearly have no idea how to maintain a consistent difficulty level for their players. I find myself nothing but annoyed at the jumpscares; there's no aura of fear or psychological horror present, just annoying zombies you can almost predict the entrances of, not to mention the roboguards' absurdity. This game could have been something fantastic, but I honestly find myself hating it deeply. I don't know if I'm willing to try putting any more time in, hoping (like with Death Stranding) I'll break through to an actually enjoyable game. It seems less and less likely, after a few hours of gameplay. I haven't wanted my money back on a game in years, but I absolutely do for Callisto Protocol.",/review/rw8751660/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2022,greg_maddux_clone,5," Callisto Protocol mistakes gore for horror
","This is a continuous problem with video games in the horror genre, but it needs to be said: blood, guts, and grotesque images aren't inherently scary.",/review/rw8751660/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,cdrevland,2," Disappointed
","First of all, it seemed to me that this was going to be a truly good horror game. Not just jump scares and cheap tricks. But what did we get? Yup, jump scares and cheap tricks. Make no mistake, this is simply an action game with gore and jump scares. That said, the combat is also bad. I wonder how it got past the concept stage. It does seem like a good concept, but it doesn't really work and it certainly isn't enjoyable to play. There are two reasons for this. The first is that it's so simple that it becomes boring almost immediately. The second is that it only works well against one enemy at a time. Sometimes against two. But certainly not more. The horrible close-up camera also doesn't help. You can't see anyone attacking you from the sides, for instance. Stealth also sucks, so that's not really a good option. So what do we have left? Not a good game, that's for sure.",/review/rw8751660/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2023,josephwarner-90552,7," Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order meets Dead Space
","Having played through the game and experienced some weird stuff like rendering issues and floating objects, the game felt like a R-Rated version of Jedi Fallen Order. Both have the same engine; where the graphics and motion blur are even identical, forcing enemies into traps with a force-based mechanic (GRP in this case) and even a melee weapon as well. Though the Fallen Order does not cause the game to crash during exiting the stealth section. Limbs do not float around after being removed after beating an enemy (Then again human enemies cannot be dismembered compared to the biophagous enemies). But while it takes a bit longer to load in game textures, the camera does not randomly zoom out after a certain sequence (the bounty hunter sequence in my case), the combat has more variety in weaponry despite the lack of energy blades, and it does not feel like a soul's clone. While the game does have its issues, it is certainly a step up from the Fallen Order.",/review/rw8751660/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2022,barrymcvea-68082,5," the callisto protocol
",Having finally completed the game it took me a little longer than it should have because I kept on getting stuck not that I didn't know what to do but because the mutated monsters where annoying the game is quit repetitive just when you think you have done just enough to move on you run into more problems literally I have never played a game in my life where the game is repetitive monster after monster. But the game was good lots and lots and lots of blood I have never played a game where it is so violent the story was good the graphics and game play I'm my opinion is out of this world just shows the power of the PlayStation 5. I am giving this game a 5 stars just because of its repetitiveness.,/review/rw8751660/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2022,mwcrunner-81576,1," Mediocre game, bad controls
","This game looks neat, but the controls are awful. You can't even attack your opponents fast enough. The story is fine, but the gameplay is awful. The creators of this game really need to fix the controls on the game immediately, or nobody is going to play this game at all. Also, they need to add better running for your character in this game. There also should be upgraded weapons, especially grenades, because when you fight the mutants in this game, there's sometimes a lot of them and there's no grenade to use on them. What's a game without grenades anyway? Nothing.! 2 out of ten for this game.",/review/rw8751660/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,EntertainmentExpert,5," Diet Dead Space
","The Callisto Protocol is like Dead Space, but not scary. I wouldn't say that it's a straight up bad game (if you don't count the PC port), but I felt that the game was a diet Dead Space. The plot is fine for a video game story. The characters, plot, atmosphere is fine. The main problem with this game is the combat. The melee combat is either too easy with one dude or too hard when they're three. So, when bosses do show up. I have an easy time dealing with the bosses. (AKA the final boss and the mini boss they reuse four times in three hours.). But when three or more enemies show up, it becomes too hard to deal with. The game isn't scary at all. Every jump scare are either too obvious or they are spammed so much when the third time in a row where the game puts a small enemies in the boxes is just becomes dull. The rest of the complaints I have are little things that add up that made the experience slower on Day 1. (Healing take a long time to do. Turning is too slow. Swapping weapons takes too long to do. The health bar is sometimes hard to see during combat. The deaf enemies being dumber than Patrick Star.) This all pays off in a cliffhanger ending that does the Dead Space Ending, but worse. (Note that some people thought wasn't even that good in the first place. Including myself.) There wasn't one time where I was greatly enjoying the experience of the time. To be fair to the game. Compared to other Triple A games, it could have been a lot worse. It's at least have very little glitches and the bad frame rate on PC is better than the entire day 1 of Fallout 76. Plus, there wasn't multiple points where I was constantly angry at, but that is a low bar to pass. I don't imagine myself playing this as much as the Dead Space games. So, if you want a game that could be a good replacement for Dead Space. Look somewhere else. Your better off playing the remake.",/review/rw8751660/?ref_=tt_urv
