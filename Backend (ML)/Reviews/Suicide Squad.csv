","En Sabah Nur is Apocalypse, the first mutant who ruled ancient Egypt until he was entombed. It's the 80's. CIA agent Moira MacTaggert goes to Egypt and witnesses his emergence. He recruits his four horsemen Magneto, Storm, Psylocke, and Angel giving them greater power. Meanwhile, Raven recruits Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler from an East Berlin fight club.

6 June 2016,KineticSeoul,7," The weakest in the trilogy, but not bad.
","Maybe it's because I had a bigger expectation for this film, but it was aiight. In the movie there is a scene where mutant students come out of the theater after watching ""Return of the Jedi"". And says something along the lines of the third installment being the worst. And that basically applies to this film, because in my opinion it's the weakest compared to the previous two X-Men movies. It's in no way a bad movie, but it just wasn't anything all that amazing either. Because the editing and progression of the story just wasn't all that compelling or interesting. Watching this movie was like watching ""Rocky 4"", it's alright but just not good as ""Rocky"" and ""Rocky 2"". The plot is basically about Apocalypse getting resurrected, finding his four horsemen while the new group of students get recruited into Xavier Institute. With it focusing in on Magneto the most next to Apocalypse with his side story and what makes him tick. It really did show how how much of a human character Magneto really is. I mean even the kindest people out there has a breaking point when you push them to their limit. I guess the human side of Magneto and the understanding of where he is coming from to a degree is what makes him one of the most popular comic book villains out there. The other horsemen that Apocalypse chooses just seemed to be shoehorned into the movie. There is few scenes that did stand out and it's basically the super action sequences. There is the introduction scene, Quicksilver to the rescue scene, Wolverine going berserker rage mode, Quicksilver fighting Apocalypse, Professor X going Freddy Krueger and Phoenix Force. So overall I don't regret seeing this movie in the theater, I do however regret seeing it in 4D. Because I personally thought it just wasn't worth it for this one. You can tell a lot about a man if you give him the crown and what he chooses to do with his power and how he treats people that are less fortunate. And I liked that type of message in this movie. Although the whole thing of the team getting together and bonding like a family isn't anything new but was nicely done. So I give this movie a 7.4/10.",/review/rw3482623/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2016,DarkVulcan29,8," Nowhere near as good has First Class and Days of Future Past, but still entertaining.
","Apocalypse who was the first mutant ever, is from the Egyptian days. Awakens in 1983, he is more powerful than ever, and puts together his own band of mutants in hopes of world domination. It's up too Charles Xavier(James McAvoy) and his band of young mutants in hopes of stopping him.",/review/rw3482623/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2016,Aaron1375,8," The X-men just band together to avoid the Apocalypse!
","My expectations were low coming into this one so I am happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It was not perfect, a Bryan Singer X-men film is never going to be perfect at this point, but it did contain a lot of cool action and quite a few mutants. Sure, I was not happy when I initially saw that Storm, Magneto and Psylocke were three of Apocalypse's horsemen in the film when none of them were in the comics; however, the story of why those three joined worked enough that I am not quite as baffled as I first was. I was disappointed by the fact that Angel was a bit more underutilized again, not sure why they find it so difficult to do him, but he does have more of a part here than in the his other film, X-men: The Last Stand which this film takes a jab at. I thought that was uncalled for, I do not understand why everyone dislikes that one so much as that one still has some of the better action sequences and fight sequences of any of the X-men films. A lot of people have been panning this one too, but as I said, I enjoyed it as I was expecting to dislike it quite a bit more than I did. It did do some things I was not fond of, but for the most part this one delivered for me.",/review/rw3482623/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2016,TheFirstExecutioner,7," A Gripping but Flawed X-Men Movie
","X-Men: Apocalypse is the sequel to Days of Future Past and takes place  about a decade later in the '80s. This movie entertained me from start  to finish and I can't say I was ever bored. But there are a lot of  things I was not satisfied with while watching. Starting off with the  good, Magneto and Professor X continue to be the best parts of these  movies. Michael Fassbender as Magneto is amazing and he has a really  emotional scene towards the beginning which got me locked into the  film. James McAvoy is also great as Xavier. The internal battles inside  Xavier's head were riveting. I really liked the new cast of the younger  X-Men, like Jean Grey, Storm, Nightcrawler, and Cyclops. Quicksilver  has another awesome scene just like the previous movie. The action is  handled very well for the most part. The first half of the movie is  terrific, but the second half brings it down.  Apocalypse as the villain was OK for me. Some scenes worked well and  others didn't. I was always skeptical of Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse and  I still don't think he was the best choice. He is just like Jesse  Eisenberg as Lex Luthor for me. Apocalypse is also a small mutant  compared to the others for some reason and he's just another villain  who is obsessed with destroying the world, and his motivations are  thin. Jennifer Lawrence was a boring Mystique. She just seems  uninspired throughout the run-time and becomes tedious since she uses  the personality over and over again to play the character. Some mutants  were completely wasted here with Psylocke and Angel. There's an entire  sequence in a secret lab and it seemed there for only one reason: the  cameo of a specific person. While it was fun to watch, it didn't do  much of anything for the story in the long run. The entire thing could  have been removed and the movie would have been the same. The final  battle felt underwhelming with the whole global extinction. The problem  is they don't show any civilians dying; it's just buildings coming  apart, making it hard to care about the situation.   Overall, X-Men: Apocalypse is a disappointing sequel to First Class and  Days of Future Past. But it is not at all a bad movie. Magneto and  Professor X are once again great, Apocalypse is a mixed bag, the pacing  for the movie is all over the place, and the dull second half just  brings the film down from the really good first half.  X-Men: Apocalypse gets a B-.",/review/rw3482623/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2016,Genti25,9," Good and interesting all the way through
","X -Men: Apocalypse is a superhero film and the ninth installment on the X-Men film series. It is directed by Brian Singer with a screenplay by Simon Kinberg. It stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar Isaac, Nicholas Hoult, Rose Byrne, Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner, Olivia Munn and Lucas Till. In Apocalypse, the ancient mutant En Sabah Nur awakens in 1983 and plans to wipe out modern civilization and take over the world, leading the X-Men to try to stop him and defeat his team of renegade mutants. I personally loved this movie from beginning to the end. I started to get emotionally invested from the Magneto scene in the woods, and from then on it was just a thrill ride. The acting is absolutely great from everyone, starting with the always amazing Michael Fassbender, who is exceptional on the role as always. The newcomers all do a really good job with the stand out, Sophie Turner who definitely does not disappoint in the iconic role. Apocalypse, played by Oscar Isaac who is taking over the world by storm (in this movie quiet literally), looks really good on screen, and the acting by Oscar is fine and serviceable. What irritated me the most were the special effects, which certainly could and should have been better. Even First Class had better effects than Apocalypse, I mean it's not all bad, there are scene that are great to look at but sometimes it just lost me on all the obvious green screen. The music is undeniably good though, the main theme is great and memorable. It does also feel a bit too long, especially with all the leading up scenes, but overall this is a really well made and absolutely fun entry in the X-Men franchise. The new trilogy, First Class, Days of Future Past and Apocalypse, is most certainly one of the best superhero trilogies there are.",/review/rw3482623/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2016,xamtaro,7," Sacrifices thematic depth and complex characters for superficial thrills and repetitive plots
","The word ""apocalypse"" brings to mind an end-of-the world event of biblical proportions. X- MEN APOCALYPSE brings to mind some Japanese anime and a yearning for the better X- men movies of the past. The third in this ""new trilogy"" that began with X-MEN FIRST CLASS, the franchise reached its high point in the epic X-MEN DAYS OF FUTURE PAST but now tips back down to a rather typical tale of good vs evil intertwined with the usual hero's journey.

","Another X-Men movie.. and again, not much of anything happens. There is a plot, yes, but it is poorly written and lacks substance/soul/meaning. The attitude of ""I don't care"" is what I came out with after seeing this movie. Instead of having a soul, it feels like a bunch of things put together in order to make money.

27 May 2016,ironhorse_iv,8," X-Men: Apocalypse was X-cellent, despite what some people might say about the film.
","Following the critically acclaimed global hit, 2014's 'X-Men: Days of Future Past', director Bryan Singer once again returns to the X-Men Franchise with 'X-Men Apocalypse'. While, this movie might not be as good as the previous movie, it was still a blast to watch! I found it, very entertaining, in the face of its dark somber and emotional tone. I was very invested in the brutal story. It's just sad that some critics don't agree with me. I think, the main reason, why they might dislike, this movie is, because the fact that Warner Bros DC Comics 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' and Disney's Marvel Studios 'Captain America: Civil War', has been trying to do, more complex mortality stories, while 20th Century Fox is trying to simple it down with the standard comic book 'save the world' plot line. For the most part, I think, they're just being a little over critical. After all, the X-Men franchise has always been a little too serious or stretch out, with its stories, dealing with bigotry, prejudice, and diversity. It's time for them to take the franchise, a little more simple and straightforward with a standard extinction storyline. After all, it's a superhero film. Yet, this movie is no lightweight. It's still has depth and strong character development. While, the civil rights issues is not explore much, here; it was still kinda refreshing to see, the X-Men have to deal with issues, something bigger. I like the concept of rational humanism vs God worshiping, here. I just wish, it was discuss more, than being limited for more a visual disaster movie, tone. Don't get me wrong, I like the visuals in this film, but I felt that the CGI could need some more work. There were parts in the film that look utterly unnatural, due to the fakeness of the green screens like the Quicksilver/ Pietro Maximoff (Evan Peters) running scene. Despite that, I love, how absolutely brutal the action is for a PG-13 movie. I just wish, I knew, what was the villain's motivational was about. I get that, the Egyptian God/Mutant, En Sabah Nur/Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) wanted to destroy the world, but I'm not entirely sure what he wants to do with it, really. It's never truly explored. He looks confused and clueless. Honestly, does he want to destroy mankind or not? It look like he could had wipeout the world, as least, 3 times, earlier in the film. Besides that, I kinda like this version of Apocalypse than the 'Age of Apocalypse' comic book version. After all, the comic version was a little too over the top with the caliber of his mutant powers. I thought Oscar Isaac did well for himself in this film. He really look and act very sinister. Still, I had a big problem with his henchmen, the Horsemen's motivations. I really don't get, why they're so willing to destroy the world. I get the reasons, why Archangel/Warren Worthington III (Ben Hardy) would, based on the story, presented and the comics; but why would Storm/Ororo Munroe (Alexandra Shipp) & Psylocke/ Elizabeth Braddock (Olivia Munn) join Apocalypse? Their motivations are not credible at all, unless, they were supposedly brainwash. Even with that, why the sudden change of heart, toward the end? Did Apocalypse's mind control suddenly turn off? It makes no sense. Anyways, there's a lot of destruction in 'Apocalypse', but very little consequence for the people that kinda starred it. It's weird that Storm would get away, scot's free, toward the end. On the other side, the motivational of the X-Men, both recurring characters and new ones were very clear. It's just odd, that Mystique/Raven Darkhölme (Jennifer Lawrence) is nothing like her comic-book counterpart. I get that Jennifer Lawrence is a big name and hate going through the long make-up process but couldn't they get her to appear and act, more like the Mystique from the comic books. After all, I kinda like villain, Mystique than hero version. It's really taking away, yet another leader role from Cyclops/Scott Summers (Tye Sheridan). He seem a bit, underdeveloped, here. Sophie Turner as Jean Grey was alright, despite, kinda being bitchy. Still, her American accent doesn't sound quite right, as her British sounding voice is really showing. As much as I dig the new characters, by far, the best is the recurring characters of Professor X/ Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto/Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender). Both were amazing in their roles. It's just sucks, that the pair barely share a scene together here. I love that fascinating relationship between them. Stan Lee also has a cameo, but it come across, as really disturbing and awkward to watch. Also, it can't be, an X-Men movie without Wolverine/Logan (Hugh Jackman). He was alright in his small bit in the film, but the inconsistency with his character is just confusing. It doesn't match, well with the end events of the last movie. I guess, that scene was just a red herring. Still, it makes you wonder, how did the real Col. William Stryker (Josh Helman) capture him for the Weapon X program? The film is full of plot-holes like this. I know this movie marks the first installment in the new X-Men series following the Cosmic Retcon. However, I don't get in the timeline, that history has been altered so much, that some mutants have now been born long before they were in the original timeline and how the recurring characters are able to age so slowly. It's a bit jarring, but I willing to give some leeway, because thinking too much about it, will give you, a headache. Despite, the trouble timeline and artistic license to both history, science and comics; I didn't really allow it, to take me out of the movie. Overall: As a conclusion to a trilogy, 'Apocalypse' falls somewhat short. Still, I say go see it, as if there is no tomorrow! It's worth the watch.",/review/rw3482623/?ref_=tt_urv

7 June 2016,zardoz-13,10," Another Great X-Men Adventure!!!
","Although it isn't coining the box office receipts that ""Captain America: Civil War"" commanded, ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" surpasses ""Captain America"" with lavish spectacle, brinksmanship suspense, and fertile fantasy. Part of the reason is that Twentieth Century Fox produces the ""X-Men"" movies, while Walt Disney Studios handles the ""Captain America"" franchise. The ""X-Men"" franchise displays greater edge and paranoia than the formulaic, facetious, Disney Marvel franchises. For example, the body count in ""The Usual Suspects"" director Bryan Singer's latest Marvel Comics adventure ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" is double, perhaps even triple that of ""Captain America."" ""Sherlock Holmes"" scenarist Simon Kinberg and Singer have no problem with liquidating some X-Men characters. Meantime, Disney produces Marvel sagas where few super-heroes suffer permanent injury. The divide and take sides ""Captain America: Civil War"" concluded in a stalemate with Cap and Iron Man playing patty-cake. The inescapable problem that Singer and Kinberg face in the ninth ""X-Men"" franchise entry is predictability. The original ""X-Men"" trilogy charted the story of Xavier's mutant super-heroes along chronological lines. The second ""X-Men"" trilogy, starting with ""X-Men: First Class"" (2011), then ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014), and finally ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" ventures backward in time, examining the origins of various characters. ""X-Men: First Class"" dealt with the 1962 Cuban Missile crisis, ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" unfolded at the end of the Vietnam War in the 1970s, and ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" transpires in the 1980s. ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" makes several allusions to ""X-Men: First Class"" about Professor Xavier's romance with CIA Agent Moira MacTaggert. Since the second ""X-Men"" trilogy occurs before the original trilogy, we know the principal characters are in little danger of annihilation. Nevertheless, Simon Kinberg's screenplays for those three films have all been imaginative, audacious, with the X-Men taking things to the brink. Clocking in at an extensive 144 minutes, ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" doesn't wear out its welcome, and Singer doesn't short-change his packed ensemble cast. Furthermore, the malevolent Apocalypse in his first full-blown cinematic incarnation proves to be a challenging opponent. ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" qualifies as a larger-than-life but slam-bang, sci-fi supernatural saga staged with considerable intellect, wit, and panache.",/review/rw3482623/?ref_=tt_urv

","X-Men is really an unusual franchise for Marvel. As an avid reader of Marvel during its breakout period fifty years ago, X-Men was a nice magazine but I would guess not one of their top sellers. Back then the talents were a little more modest, Cyclops and X-Girl were around along with Angel, Iceman and Beast (not blue). As a movie franchise I would guess X-Men is Marvel's top seller, they have gotten a lot of mileage out of the characters and have almost flawlessly crossed over to a younger cast (but for Wolverine).
