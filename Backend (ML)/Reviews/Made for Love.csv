31 December 2010,jotix100,5," Shoot the trumpet player
","Damien Chazelle, the director of this film, was clearly influenced by some of the French New Wave directors, particularly, Jean-Luc Godard, as well as others, but it is obvious he likes that period. His style gives the viewer a feeling of being somewhat improvisational as he takes his camera into the Boston streets to illustrate the story he wanted to tell. The film shot in black and white takes the viewer to another era when movies were perhaps more spontaneous and without a rigid story line.",/review/rw4286142/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2015,StevePulaski,6," An exercise in style first and foremost
","Who would've thought director Damien Chazelle, following his low-key, festival-success with Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench, would go on to be something of a hot commodity in the film world just five years later with the release of his sophomore effort Whiplash, meriting several Oscar nominations and wins and a whirlwind of positive buzz? To say Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench is a different film from Whiplash is an understatement. While I obviously did not go into this film expecting to see a film similar in style or quality to Whiplash, judging simply by the plot and the poster, I think it's worth noting that I'm not particularly sure both of these films exist in the same universe together. I highly doubt there's anything resembling a Terence Fletcher in the whimsical world of Guy and Madeline.",/review/rw4286142/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2011,marknyc,5," A missed opportunity
","I thought the conceit of the film was to juxtapose a micro budget with a lush symphonic score and Godardish realism with tap dance numbers, but that never really happens. The musical numbers are few and far between, and the only real one (Boy in the Park) doesn't come until 3/4 of the way into the film.",/review/rw4286142/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2015,Red_Identity,," Solid debut
","I definitely sought this out because of a particular reason- Damian Chazelle and Whiplash. Whiplash is an amazing film, intense, full of passion, and so I wanted to see his debut. It's a solid debut, if unremarkable and sort of dull at times. It's very natural and there's really nothing that would indicate the strong intensity in Whiplash. The only similarities are really that instruments and music are at the core (just like, also, the film he co-wrote grand Piano). Yeah, I could see many not liking this at all or liking Whiplash, or even, liking this or not Whiplash because both are so different in style so there's no telling which way the passion will go. I recommend it slightly, but it's not totally recommended and not a home run by any means",/review/rw4286142/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2017,Quinoa1984,5," the good stuff is really good. the rest is almost unwatchable
","It seems unfair to review this film for the simple reason that it didn't start as a work that was looking for theatrical distribution; like Scorsese before him with Who's That Knocking at my Door, Damien Chazelle made Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench as a student film, and probably due to some encouragement submitted it to some festivals and got in, most notably to Tribeca and AFI.",/review/rw4286142/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2018,CinemaClown,," Here's To The Ones Who Dream
","Damien Chazelle's feature film debut may not hold a candle to his subsequent films but it does showcase many of the themes & trademarks that he would go on to refine & perfect in his later works, especially the role of music in driving his narratives and his penchant for talented & ambitious protagonists. Not a memorable start by any means but a start nonetheless. And the creative leaps he's made since this film only speaks of his quick grasp & understanding of the filmmaking medium.",/review/rw4286142/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2014,dataconflossmoor-1,10," Realistically Entertaining
","It isn't very often that a film delves into the art of conversation. The impetuous passion and exuberance to depict the romantic angle of flawed behavior was succinctly illustrated in this movie! The film ""Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench"" accentuates the bittersweet reality between the visceral portrayal of who we are, as opposed to the idealistic image on how we perceive ourselves. A low budget, film such as ""Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench"" dwells on people living on a struggling budget in New York City, and how Jazz, Dancing, and Conversations about stuff, influence the lives of two very impressionable people. So frequently, we as a movie audience are barraged with high cost sensationalism and fusillades of fire explosions to mesmerize our sense of immediate gratification. ""Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench"" ruminates the human element to exact people's insecurities, and purport those insecurities as being an aspect of comedic relief to the movie audience! I felt that the unpolished demeanor to this film left an indelible mark of positive energy for the artistically imbued! The acting, direction and overall production of this movie underlined the real purpose for making a film. This purpose being that ""Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench"" evoked a humanism that many discerning critics deem as necessary to expand the dynamic of innovative movie making. I highly tout this independent diamond in the rough as being a mandatory pr√©cis in the paradigm of film making. See this movie when you are in the mood to feel like a human being, and nothing else! I give it a faulted five stars! I think you'll know what I am talking about after you see this movie!",/review/rw4286142/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2017,ThomasDrufke,6," The Struggle of Love
","Damien Chazelle's first feature length film isn't an easy one to dissect. Filmed like an early John Cassavetes' movie and told with little to no dialogue at all, Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench is much more so an exploration into how difficult it is to maintain love than it is a musical like Chazelle's latest feature, La La Land. But it's Chazelle's grasp on the ups and down's of relationships that make this yet another interesting directorial effort from him. All 3 of his films to this point have involved Jazz, and all 3 of them have also dealt with characters trying to balance their love life with pursuing their Jazz related dreams. 'Guy and Madeline' isn't as intense as Whiplash nor as viscerally memorable as La La Land, but for a first- time feature, it definitely impresses. An occasional dance number, unique camera movement, and long unedited takes make for quite the viewing experience. Again, there's little dialogue, so I can't say I was as invested in the characters as I should have been, but sometimes scenes are more powerful when less is said (see: the final scene). If anything, this was an interesting watch considering all we know about Chazelle's career up to this point.",/review/rw4286142/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2018,Movie_Muse_Reviews,6," Chazelle's debut brings together indie filmmaking and movie musical elements
","Damien Chazelle's debut feels somewhere between a Jim Jarmusch indie and an Astaire-Roger musical. Here's a filmmaker with a deep love of the movie musical trying to make it work on a shoestring budget. The musical genre begs for rich production, so Chazelle tries to circumvent it with a nontraditional script; the central relationship is told in undefined fragments and almost exclusively in the less-sexy aftermath of their love. The musical elements are instead used as flourishes - sometimes daydreams, sometimes as breaks from the story. It's a mess, but one with its charms.",/review/rw4286142/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2017,WhimsicalVonia,7," A marvelous jazz musical debut worth more for its subtlety!

7 July 2020,caleblimsw,7," Chazelle and Hurwitz's debut is full of potential and charm, and little else besides
","Chazelle's debut feature is a charmingly small-scale one, following the eponymous Guy and Madeline in the aftermath of their breakup. Mixed perfectly with Hurwitz's scoring, the film comes to life in broad shifts of tonal brilliance, exemplified by exceptional scenes such as ""Love in the Fall"" and ""Boy in the Park"", where Chazelle shines as a director with a good sense of framing and purpose in his camerawork. Elsewhere, frequent long takes and close-ups build up a distinctly personal style which, accompanied by decent performances from Desiree Garcia and Jason Palmer, helps the audience understand the characters better. Chazelle uses the age-old trope of the two lovers temporarily separated to set-up and underline the film, filling it with seemingly unconnected glimpses of the lives of each one, but through cunning use of sound, thematically and tonally feels united and smoothly transitions these themes from scene to scene.",/review/rw4286142/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,valfedox,8," La La Land with a 500 times lower budget

6 June 2011,br5833,8," Delightful musical romance
","This is a sweet film. I was very impressed with the film editing because the film is beautifully set to a jazz soundtrack motivated by the narrative since the male protagonist (""Guy"" of the title) is a jazz trumpet player. The film not only depicts the romance of the leads (Guy and Madeline), but also the city in which they live. I really enjoyed the beautiful city shots, both in Boston and New York. The soundtrack is great - especially the jazz, including that played by Guy, but not only. The film is full of references to French post-war films so it's added fun to watch for the expert as well. The director did a lot with the camera, so it works well that the film is rather sparse in dialog. The actors' faces say everything. The lead performers, in particular, were outstanding: their faces are extraordinarily expressive. The moments when the actors break out in song and dance were just pure fun.",/review/rw4286142/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2010,hlmrw100,1," Bring ear-muffs, dark glasses and your patience.
","Save yourself the time and trouble as this is more of a ""first-year film student"" type of picture. It was painful to watch and my first was reaction was ""that was 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back."" I should have gone with my first impression and walked out after the first ten minutes. There is basically no plot to speak of, very poor cinematography, no character development, poor acting all around and generally no redeeming qualities to speak of. There were some great opportunities to show some of the more interesting sights and sounds of Boston. However to film instead chooses to show irrelevant close-ups of the actors for no apparent reason. The sound mixing and quality is very ""unusual"" to say the least and you may want to consider bringing your ear-muffs. The picture qualify is even less finished. There was perhaps one sequence in the entire film which would be considered big screen worthy, that of restaurant dancing/singing number. Overall, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",/review/rw4286142/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2020,Jeremy_Urquhart,5," Damien Chazelle has come a LONG way
","After loving both Whiplash and La La Land more than just about any movie that came out in the respective years they were released, I looked through Chazelle's filmography, keen to watch more. First Man was a pretty good follow-up, but finding another music-related film, that was apparently a musical? And had great reviews? I tried to keep my expectations tempered because of the tiny budget and the fact that it was something of a student film, but even then... finally getting around to this proved disappointing.",/review/rw4286142/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2009,amwknicks,9," A tender tale of torment, trumpet, and tap
","Shot in black and white on a hand-held 35 mm DXL Supreme MP, Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench is a period piece without a period, a beautiful glimpse into a world without beauty, a heart-rending portrayal of the heartless. The film swings (no pun intended :)!!) between tortured silences and undistilled brassy mirth, with a fantastic debut performance from trumpeter and lead man Jason Palmer.",/review/rw4286142/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2012,geoff-367,1," Disastrously awful

2 May 2017,LaLaLandSucks,1," A Fat Rip Off of Young Girls of Rochefort
","The defamation and exposure of Chazelle's dirty little secrets continues. This film is another rip off of Jacques Demy's work. He rips off the restaurant dance sequences straight from Young Girls of Rochefort. It's also another two character romance story that rips exactly off of Umbrellas of Cherbourg. Why is this guy allowed to make three of the same movies about the same message: obsession with art and ambition, while making the same three remakes that rip off of a true artist? Picasso truly has ruined art. This is embarrassing how this guy has manipulated everyone into thinking he is some original genius, but he is just as much of a hack as Tarantino.",/review/rw4286142/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2019,tuzlukek,10," Viva Cassavetes
","I like this film because it is almost an omage to ""Shadows"" - a Film by John Cassavetes done in 1959, exactly 50 years ago. But no matter how it looks simmilar with ""Shadows"" because of improvised dialogue (read: free dialogue on previously ""fixed"" concept), and cinema-verite style in camera-work, there is a definite proof that director knows how to build a solid scene out of a few fragments, how to direct and build up certain degree of emotion without going into cliche, and how to deal with the details. It is also important to notice how Damian Chazelle develops as a director, starting with ""author"" low budget film like this, than steps into mainstream with more ariculate Whiplash, going to mature on artistic LaLaLand and finaly nails into big budget with First Man, all in 9 years. Building his craft on the foundations and legacy of the old master directors, he still has his vivid ""own"" approach to the genre, quality that we could find in Bryan De Palma, Martin Scorcesse, Tim Burton, Cohen Brothers and the similar ""big timers"". This movie is not a materpiece, but it carries a mark of a man with the vision. Film has it's ""microcosmos"", it's tone, it's look, things that are not easy to achieve. I might be subjective, but 10 stars.",/review/rw4286142/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2018,michaelalanhollis,3," Chazelle has come a long way...
","It gives me great hope as a director to know that Damien Chazelle went from ... This... To an amazing film like La La Land in only 7 years. An impressive improvement. The music for this film was definitely the strong point, with some numbers working well. But the attempt at the realistic dialogue was unfortunately ruined by the actors. This film felt like it was trying so hard to be so unique, yet it seemed like the movie had confidence issues.",/review/rw4286142/?ref_=tt_urv
