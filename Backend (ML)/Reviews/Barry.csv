27 July 2010,beresfordjd,10," Nailed it!!
","To my surprise they absolutely nailed it. Cumberbatch is a fantastic choice for Sherlock Holmes-he is physically right (he fits the traditional reading of the character) and he is a damn good actor. Martin Freeman, about whom I wasn't sure at first, is an excellent foil for Holmes without being the dumb sidekick that Dr Watson has often been. I thought that this series would not work, particularly after Robert Downey's interesting take on Conan Doyle's characterisation. I have been proved so wrong-it moved along at a good pace and held the attention brilliantly. My wife started by saying she didn't like it but by the end of the episode she was as enthralled as I. We are both looking forward to the rest of the series, if it is as entertaining as the first story. I was disappointed to read some reviews here that did not love it. Methinks they are too jaded to enjoy anything.",/review/rw8482258/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2021,Supermanfan-13,9," Benedict Cumberbatch is terrific as Sherlock!
","Sherlock is such an absolutely brilliant show! All you have to do is read through some of the reviews to see how loved this show really is. It's one of the best rated tv shows on just about every website for a reason...because it's incredible! There have been a lot of different versions of Sherlock Holmes with a bunch of really good ones (Robert Downey Jr., Jonny Lee Miller) and with some really bad ones but Benedict Cumberbatch is the best of them!",/review/rw8482258/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Brilliant!
",Sherlock is just an incredible series. It has a 9.1 rating for a reason. There have been so many shows and movies based off Sherlock Holmes but I can say with confidence that this is the best of them. The writing and acting is would makes this show so special. Every single season is just as good as the others. Benedict Cumberbatch was born to play this role...he is Sherlock Holmes. Martin Freeman also stars as Dr. John Watson and those two lead just an overall great cast. This show won so many awards including 9 Emmys over the course of its run. If you haven't seen this amazing show yet then do yourself a favor and go watch it as soon as possible!,/review/rw8482258/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2010,DaveFilmlover,10," Will have Conan Doyle spinning in his grave...............
","..with delight. A brilliantly written, well acted programme. Well done to all concerned. The story had me hooked from the start.All the elements of Holmes are present and correct. So far most of the original characters have appeared, with hints of more yet to appear. It is suspenseful and sometimes genuinely funny. I have read all the original stories, and after the late, great Jeremy Brett, despaired of ever seeing another top notch Holmes film. This is it, Brought up to date into the 21st century, but done with affection and respect to the original. Nice to see the writers have continued the theme of an intelligent (slightly bemused) Watson. CAN WE HAVE A FULL SERIES PLEASE. If not this is one I will return to again and again.",/review/rw8482258/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2010,alfa-16,," A Study in Picture Gallery Red
","What we have here is a very interestingly rendered modern version of Holmes' first appearance, A Study in Scarlet, in which he meets Watson, they take the rooms in Baker Street and successfully investigate a series of murders. ",/review/rw8482258/?ref_=tt_urv

10 January 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,8," Initially this was astounding, sadly that form failed in the last two seasons.
","I am not surprised that the earliest reviews are all ten stars, I would have also judged Series one and two with that score, sadly they took something away in the latter years, the show became too clever for its own good, they sacrificed style for substance. Back to the positives, the first two series, and in fairness The Abominable Bride I think are outstanding, they are clever, witty, absorbing, genuinely thrilling viewing. The performances throughout are sensational, I cannot compliment Cumberbatch and Freeman enough, they make a great double act, and inject a massive energy. I can appreciate the show as independent from the works of Conan Doyle, but when I want Sherlock Holmes, it's Jeremy Brett I look to. Personally, the highlight of the show was Andrew Scott, who's Moriarty was nothing short of astounding, he stole every scene he appeared in, a shame they killed him off when they did. I think Moffat took on too much with this and Doctor Who, and it seemed both shows dipped at the same time, he should have made a choice and focused on one show, it was surely too much work doing both. I hope very much that the show returns, and the genius that was evident in Series one and Two returns also. Highlight for me has to be The Reichenbach Fall, which is simply incredible.",/review/rw8482258/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2021,SnoopyStyle,8," love the style
",Steven Moffat modernizes the classic Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) and brings him into the modern world. Dr. John Watson (Martin Freeman) is his best friend and co-investigator. I like the style. I really love the style. The chemistry between Cumberbatch and Freeman is terrific. The stories get be a bit messy but I put it down more due to the chaotic style and I do like the style. This show has a real visual energy to the old material.,/review/rw8482258/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2010,carla-godfrey2506,10," Brilliant!
","I think it is always a bit uncertain and tricky when a 19th century series or film is modernised and most of the time it doesn't work, especially if it is well known and liked but I was very very impressed. Benedict does a brilliant job portraying the famous sleuth and made a 19th century character and modern day London merge beautifully. Martin Freeman was also great as Dr Watson. Rupert Graves made a brilliant Lestrade. It was sharp, quick and kept you on your toes and you just couldn't wait to see what happened next, this was of course completed by brilliant acting from the actors. I'm so pleased it got favourable reviews from the critics, roll on the next episode!!!!",/review/rw8482258/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2022,oscarjneklund,8," Very Good, gotta love sociopaths, yes? üîç
","Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman is the perfect duo for solving crimes. The sociopathic Sherlock Holmes is crazy and played very well and realistic by Cumberbatch. It's funny when a sociopath collides with the empathic Watson, you can really tell how sick Sherlock Holmes really is! üá¨üáß",/review/rw8482258/?ref_=tt_urv

28 July 2010,Benja075,10," Was going to vote, but that's not enough... A MUST FOR ALL!
","It's after 2am and I have just registered on IMDb after watching the first ep of Sherlock as I was compelled to get it out there that this show presents some PURE BRILLIANCE in its delivery of my favourite fictional detective. Hard to believe they could create a setting in modern times where the illustrious Holmes and Watson set off on their adventures and absolutely GET IT RIGHT, in every aspect. Sir Arthur would, I believe, approve of this adaptation and be pleased that yet another generation is able to live the thrill of the chase, the connection of obscure yet obvious (to a genius) clues... the little things that have a far greater relevance than you would normally perceive. For a first episode... BUGGER ME, I am more than hooked and now await more installments and hope that each episode is as brilliant as the last... I have a feeling it will continue from strength to strength as we delve deeper into the darkness that is the mind of Sherlock Holmes. if they had an 11 out of 10 rating... that's my vote. The game is definitely on my dear Watson!",/review/rw8482258/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2010,akilamike,10," A masterpiece
","One word to describe this show..'excellent'. A true master piece. I am a huge fan of the original Sherlock Holmes books and TV shows. When I sat down to watch this, at the first glimpse I was a bit disappointed. The show started in a somewhat different way than I imagined. Few minutes later, I found out that the 'difference' I experienced is what makes this series unique and brilliant. The cast is spot on. Couldn't have picked a better guy for Holmes or Lestrade. Yet, Dr. Watson doesn't match the original picture.Who cares hey? The story is full of twists and turns and fascinating to see the techniques of deduction. The merging of old reasoning and new technology has been done magnificently. So, its a Holmes with a laptop and a smart phone.that who we see.and that can be easily related than those 1800's detective.",/review/rw8482258/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2010,ninjacow225285,10," Unique and well done
","I have been an avid fan of Sherlock Holmes from a very young age, and my first reaction upon hearing of a modern TV remake was ""oh bugger, they are so going to screw this up"". However, i am glad to report that, unlike so many other TV adaptations and especially ones that modernise, i found it witty, clever and above all, entertaining. It was extremely reverential of its considerable pedigree and included a large number of coded references and callbacks for the more avid fan, e.g. the use of scratches around a persons mobile phone charger port to indicate a drunkard rather than a pocket watches winding keyhole. I imagine many were irked by this and as i can see from the ratings many did not care for it at all, but for me it was simply sublime, and well deserving of a 10 out of 10",/review/rw8482258/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Loved it!
","As a huge fan not only of the stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but also of the portrayals given by Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett, I saw Sherlock. And to be honest, and I don't know why, but I was expecting to hate it.",/review/rw8482258/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2010,bradydm2001,10," Sounds like a bad idea, right? Think again. The more things change...
","As a die-hard fan of the source material, I have tracked down and went through nearly every radio, television, film, and comic book interpretation of Sherlock Holmes - which run a mean gamut regarding quality, as you probably already know - and so I approached this incarnation skeptical but sanguine. Doubtful it would match the eminent Jeremy Brett series in quality, but hopeful it might preserve Conan's tone - something I think that series did well and the Downey Jr. movie did not.",/review/rw8482258/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,tubibii,10," Truly incredible, best Sherlock series out there
","Let me start by saying this, you will not find a better Sherlock adaption than this. Benedict Cumberbatch is amazing as Sherlock, I really can't see anyone else playing him. And Martin Freeman is just immaculate as dr Watson. Oh and don't get me started on Andrew Scott, holy moly!",/review/rw8482258/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2017,samyoung-82648,6," Skip the 4th season. Keep your memories happy
","If I was to rate the Sherlock Holmes series on season 4 alone, I would give this 0/10 if possible. Benedict Cumberbatch (Holmes) was barely tolerable and the new surprise character was appalling. Without giving away too much, they draw a parallel to who this character is ""meant to be like"". Sad to say that the performance wasn't even in the ballpark.

27 January 2011,devil_knight,8," Not quite so elementary! Brilliant indeed!
","When someone pointed me to Sherlock- a new series on BBC I was, to say the least, a bit skeptical. On top of that, I was told that this Sherlock lived in London in 2010 and was fond of texting on his Blackberry and hosted a website? Color me confused! But I gave it a looksie ‚Äìafter all how bad could it be- Holmes is Holmes. On screen appears a lanky young fellow in a trench coat, getting high on nicotine patches who I am supposed to believe is Sherlock Holmes? This was, as far from my favorite pipe smoking, deer hunting cap wearing image of Holmes, as it could be. I rolled my eyes-this is going to be cheesy. But then in one swift sequence "" the lanky young Holmes"" in his first meeting with John Watson describes him, his profession , his relationship with his brother and his brother's marital status-all by one look at his cell phone (that's right his cell phone). BANG! I was hooked. This is Sherlock Holmes through and through.",/review/rw8482258/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2014,winner55,6," Doyle's detective or Moffat's super hero?
","Sherlock This series is difficult to write about, because it flew so high at the beginning, re imagining Holmes as a troubled but brilliant modern detective and Watson as a haunted but loyal man of action, in episodes promising to be re-interpretations of classic stories in an era of high technology. But it has fallen so low, riddled with the writers' own personal manias, and Steven Moffat's decision to twist his narratives (no longer 'stories' in the conventional sense), to redesign Holmes as a troubled and alienated super-hero wandering aimlessly through visual gimmickry and spectacular effects. The third episode of Season 3 is especially appalling. The moment towards the end when Sherlock shouts ""I am not a hero, I am a functioning sociopath!"" was so painful, I still can't get it out of my head. That moment surely has nothing to do with the character of Sherlock Holmes, the all-too-human hero (which he most certainly was) created by Conan Doyle, but it defines how Moffat and his team understand *their* character, 'Sherlock,' and perhaps how they understand their audience as well. Given the popularity of this show, apparently many young people do not want exceptional humans capable of resolving difficult problems, they want sick people with friends in high places who can thrash the arrogant and get away with it.",/review/rw8482258/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2022,zhuiiy,10," Well done
","I don't usually watch detective shows, but Sherlock totally hooked me. Not only is it not boring, it is also very interesting. But don't watch it all in one sitting, as it requires your concentration and can be tiring to watch for a long time.",/review/rw8482258/?ref_=tt_urv
