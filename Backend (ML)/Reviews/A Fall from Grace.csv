30 September 2021,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,7," Unexpected Gem
","This was an unexpected gem. I went into it not having seen the trailer. It's a modern day gothic horror, except it takes place in a women's only boarding house in Cleveland instead of a mansion. The boarding house has a secret that is gradually revealed. The boarding house has gatekeepers that protect and hide those secrets. It has ghosts and supernatural elements, even some brief gore. Cool things happen in the shadowy areas of the frame to get the attention of the protagonist. She gradually uncovers the secrets piece by piece.",/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2021,Tweekums,7," An atmospheric little horror film
","Ambar is a young Mexican woman living in Cleveland; because she has no documentation she can't get a decent job or find anywhere to live for very long. After being forced to move she finds an advert for cheap accommodation; it is a rather rundown building and Red, the manager, is a bit creepy but with little else to choose from she moves in. She is almost immediately disturbed by strange sounds and nightmares. It isn't long before she is in real danger.",/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2021,Pairic,7," Meso-American Myths
","No One Gets Out Alive: A ramshackle old home, turned into a boarding house is one of the main stars of this film. It's corridors and dark rooms contain creaks, cries and noises, suggestions that something strange is going on. We know from the prologue that the residence is connected to an archaeological expedition to Meso-America and artifacts from the mission are stored there. Ambar (Cristina Rodlo) is an immigrant, hiding her illegal status, exploited in a sweatshop, trying to buy papers. She moves into the boarding house and encounters ghosts. A tale of terror, exploitation and human sacrifice. Some good ghostly apparitions together with poltergeist effects. This is also a story of a struggle for survival in the physical and spiritual senses, both inside and without the house. Very much influenced by Meso-American mythology. Directed by Santiago Menghini, screenplay by Jon Croker and Fernanda Coppel, based on the 2014 novel by Adam Nevill. On Netflix. 7/10.",/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2021,paul_haakonsen,5," Watchable, although not an outstanding horror flick...
","I had not even heard about this 2021 horror mystery titled ""No One Gets Out Alive"" prior to sitting down to watch it on Netflix. But I must admit that the synopsis for the movie sounded interesting, and so did the title of the movie. And with it being a new horror movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I had to sit down to watch. I am a horror fan after all.",/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2021,wesleythegnome,6," Has good elements
","I enjoyed the backstory and circumstances of the protagonist. It felt very realistic, and is the aspect of the movie that I found most gripping. At the start, she's not literally trapped inside the house, she's trapped by her circumstances.",/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2021,feelreallove-921-845971,7," Pretty Well Done
","A lot of new stuff on Netflix is pretty pathetic. I love horror so figured I'd have a look. The main character has a good back story and stuff that happens along the way makes this more than a slasher film. It creates some real compassion for her. The last scenes are impressive. I tend not to listen to reviewers who have 'read the book' because they don't get that the language of film is different to that of literature (pretty much what Peter Jackson said of LOTR and look at the success of that). Horror is like comedy; it's subjective. Have a look, you might enjoy it.",/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2021,MikeWright75,5," Not as good as the novel
","If you haven't read the book, then this is a pretty good stand alone bog standard horror. It's creepy and original in parts but sadly, it captures none of the desolation and gothic pagan horror of the book.",/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2021,kosmasp,7," Living (in) it
",I have to admit I did not even know this was based on a novel (as another reviewer suggests in his review). So obviously I cannot talk about how this fares against the written counterpart/source. Although I reckon it is safe to say that the novel probably is better.,/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2021,Draysan-Jennings,5," Let me get this straight
","Two brothers sacrifice immigrant women to some giant moth creature thing because one of the brothers is sick. Apparently feeding heads to this monsters vagina helps cure the brothers sickness. Also the ghosts of these women haunt the boarding house they live in. After spending 3 hours watching this film because it couldn't keep my attention, I finally got it. It had a fairly original plot, but for the most part it's basically just a supernatural haunted house flick with a strange monster in the end. Some people will like it some people will hate it. 5 stars.",/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2021,PedroPires90,6," 3rd act...wow
","This was being a bit generic but with good production values...however, the final act is really great. That creature design by itself it's half star. üòé",/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2021,BandSAboutMovies,6," I kind of enjoyed it!
","Based on the 2014 novel of the same name by Adam Nevill, this film is about Amber, an illegal immigrant who stayed in Mexico to care for her sick mother until the older woman died. Now in Cleveland, her American dream is constantly destroyed by people taking her dignity, her money and perhaps, they'll even take her life.",/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2021,patherwill,7," Genuinely creepy little movie
","Well, reviews are personal to all and that's why some give 1 and others 10. I thought the acting was very good especially Marc Menchaca and Cristina Rodlo. The girl Ambar, had arrived in the US w/o papers, docs or id so she WAS an illegal who wanted an opportunity to better herself. At times I felt so sorry for the girl - she was very naive and trusting, it was obvious really what the African was going to do. That rarity, NO CGI and the 'creature' seemed to be like an autotronic but I'm not sure of that. The house was just horrendously in a world apart- just like Norman Bates house was in Psycho. Certainly worth your time to see.",/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2021,nathanmanson,6," Maybe because I'm drunk but i actually enjoyed that
","I'm quite drunk but that was actually enjoyable. I thought going into it, it would be a boring none scary Netflix horror. However I was completely wrong. It was very ere all the time and was actually scary, you can't knock it. The story might've been a bit hard to follow hence why it gets a 6 and nothing higher. But a 6 is a lot higher then I thought I'd be giving this at the start. This has nothing to do with the film but the main character was so sexy it's ridiculous. All in all though genuinely not a bad horror and decent horrors are really hard to come by nowadays. Might I add also, Netflix films have improved so much. You get so much better Netflix films now then when you did at the start, I'm really enjoying them.",/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2021,mystee_reyne,5," Interesting but....
","This movie is interesting enough to watch. But, the main character is so naive and slow to catch on, it's unbelievable. Also, there are many plot holes.",/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2021,el7,7," Makes me want to check out other stories by this author.
","English writer Adam Nevill wrote the novel upon which this screenplay was adapted, as well as the novel on which The Ritual was adapted, and reportedly this won't be the last novel of his adapted for the screen. Like The Ritual, No One Gets Out Alive features a plot rich with psychological horror which eventually is revealed to be a creature feature with creature design that deserves a gory chef's kiss. I'm seeing some people complain about how the story was reset in Cleveland with a Mexican heroine, but Nevill himself is one of the executive producers on this film so I can't imagine he's all that bothered about it.",/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv

",Starts out not too bad. Creepy and some suspense. But near the end it gets filled with plot holes and scenes that make no sense. The ending spoiled it.,/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2021,jmbovan-47-160173,7," Interesting atmospheric film
","You won't know exactly what is happening at the beginning of thr film except things seem off and all the warning lights are flashing. At the end if the film, you still won't have a clear picture but more a felt sense of what is happening. And that is creepy. Well acted by the lead actress, and production and direction are well executed. Ultimately, the film loses just a bit without a clearer understanding of what is happening, but at the same time, sometimes an answer doesn't help things. Personal choice on how the ending is for you.",/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2021,witra_as,7," Decent atmospheric horror
",Decent atmospheric horror based on novel which Menghini built its own suspense through mild violence and supernatural scares. Rodlo's desperate act underlined the precarious immigrant status nicely. Gothic apartment and wicked creature were commendable.,/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2021,Shadowking1001,3," What did I just watch???
","The first two thirds of the movie was good, but the final third was terrible. There was no proper back story, so you are sitting there trying to figure out why any of this is happening. There is just a series of jumping from one scene to another. Then when the creature is revealed, it was more comedic than scary.",/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2021,jjnieuwoudt,7," Atmospheric
","Competent thriller/horror with folk horror overtones. Not groundbreaking in any way but nevertheless some very unique and interesting ideas. Great acting and sensational cinematography. The narrative kept the origins of the box murky which added to the mystery and suspense. The ""house"" was wonderfully imagined and contributed to the ambiance. A few traditional jump scares but they didn't detract from the film. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed it.",/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv

",It has a creepy atmosphere and the acting is excellent but the story was just ok and there wasnt much tension or really scary scenes it has some elements and a little violence and mild gore but overall it was an average thriller horror film. It's worth watching once and like I said at least it's an ACTUAL movie not some found footage garbage decent quality film as well it's a 5.5 thus the 6 rating.,/review/rw7400253/?ref_=tt_urv
