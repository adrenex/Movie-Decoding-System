30 June 2004,StayinFrosty,," Smart, action-packed, and a lot of the time, pretty hilarious!
","ReBoot takes place in the city of Mainframe, representing the inside of a computer. The characters' speech reflects this with words and expressions like: random (crazy), basic (stupid), deleted or nullified (killed), and there was a time Enzo realized he should've ""copied and pasted the truth""! Characters include binomes (citizens shaped like numbers, usually 1s and 0s), sprites (more human-like) and viruses (usually villains).",/review/rw1253056/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2002,maxvaughn,10," I love this show.
","I confess, I am a Reboot junky.  I have no clue why I like this show, considering that I'm opposed to the over-used element of CGI in animation today, yet something about Reboot keeps my attention.  When I first started watching, I was still in Elementary school and I liked being able to name all the movies the show was doing parodies of.  A few years passed and I forgot about it, until the re-runs aired on Cartoon Network.  Then, the plot/new episodes became more dramatic and I couldn't stop watching!  The characters are likable and the battle between virus and guardians is a great hook.  Someone once said, ""Reboot is what Tron should have been"".",/review/rw1253056/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2018,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,9," Twenty-four years later and ReBoot is still a pioneering series in the medium of television animation.
","ReBoot set the bar for cg-animated tv for generations to come, and it's been widely regarded as a classic cultural milestone from the 90s, just like Pokemon or Spongebob went on to be comparable phenomena in the decade. Also, it's Canada's BEST cartoon ever! It's eons ahead of the other animated stuff the country's produced over the last decade, and ReBoot is still great entertainment for kids and adults today. Compare it to something like Total Drama Island: there's no comparison as to which one is better.",/review/rw1253056/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 1999,Alan-40,," Detractors are missing the point -- this is the best animated art ever on TV!
","The original premise is simple and somewhat lighthearted.  What would it be like to live INSIDE a video game, where you were the one of the entities that had to deal with the ""user,"" who lives outside?  That kind of plotline, and that this is a cartoon marketed to kids, is bound to win quick dismissal from many of those looking for ""serious"" fiction and perhaps that is justified.  But Reboot is far more than that.",/review/rw1253056/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2002,layer8,," Amazing
","It's 1994. I'm 11 years old, riding on a bus with my mom. I look around at all the advertisements, and one catches my eye. ReBoot. After all these years, I can still remember the tagline: ""In Mainframe, no one dies. They are erased.""",/review/rw1253056/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2001,bigsleepj,," I agree! Great!
","Reboot is REALLY the best TV series. Beast Wars had a decent story line and setting through the entire series, but individual episodes had lots to be desired; ill conceived concoction of questionable outings that I am certain I have have seen before.",/review/rw1253056/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2015,Foreverisacastironmess123,10," One legendary blast of a CGI animated series that is simply too epic to ever be forgotten.
","This was one of my all-time childhood favourites and it still is today. The animation style was so out of this world and was nothing remotely like anything I'd ever seen before and I was hooked, from the first show. Every once a week it was a little bit of super-fun happiness at the thought of getting home and watching ReBoot! How it looks is still kind of startling to this day, even to me, and I still get take aback for a second when I haven't seen it in a while! It had such a rich spirit of fun and adventure to it, and as it went on and was eventually free to do so, it skillfully introduced a little welcome darkness and tragedy into the mix as well. The iconic intro always got you in just the exact right kind of mindset to get into the world of the show, and of all the variations, I liked the one with Megabyte the best. Such an utterly fantastic and commanding villain. Calm and cultured, calculating and deadly. It may not have seemed so at first glance, but of the two viruses, he was the truly destructive and malevolent one. What a performance from the late- great Tony Jay to leave behind, you can really tell that he relished every last second that he got to voice the role. Heroes and villains alike, all the characters were terrific and I just loved to watch them. The Binomes are a bit annoying and stupid at first but they do grow on you a lot, they used them in a lot of funny referential skits. I liked the Mulder and Scully ones! My favourite character is insane chaos personified, Hexadecimal because she was often hilariously outrageous, but you also always got a sense of the awesome power that she commanded. And I loved the spidery way she glided around and would wave her hand over her mask to give it a new fixed expression, I found the idea of her fascinating and a work of art in itself. Also her warped and often scary but genuine love for Bob was touching and she actually undergoes the most character development, going from a straight-up villainess to a real hero who sacrifices herself to save everyone. As a kid I never saw beyond the episode where Bob is shot into the wild Web by Megabyte and Enzo claims his badge as the new Guardian because that was when CITV decided to stop broadcasting it. It was the better part of 20 years before I got to see the rest and really take in and appreciate fully just how much the series evolves from what it starts out as. It was such an amazing concept that the sprites' realm of Mainframe may have been an individual computer from the other side and was like an island floating in space, and their whole universe was part of a vast web/internet - whatever you wanna call it, and that the ""User"", presumably the human being who operates the computer in the 'real world', may as well have been god as far as the Sprites were concerned, and that when a game was put into the system, to the User it was harmless fun, but to them it was a sporting, but still desperate struggle that they absolutely had to win, 'lest a giant cube-shaped chunk of their city be permanently obliterated! The metaphorical implications can practically be interpreted in a hundred different ways! This was a show that had everything, and it's just as enjoyable today as when it first aired. And no way in hell is it just blind nostalgic fandom that keeps it alive, it really is a show that holds up beautifully. The amount of references to pop culture, video games and computer technology that is excellently integrated into near-every episode alone adds hugely to the fun appeal and watch-ability factor of it. I'll always love this show, it'll never lose any of its magic or lustre in my eyes. Thank for ya time, and with that..heck all I can think of to say is ""REBOOT!!!""",/review/rw1253056/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2003,thomaswrobel,," Works on many levels.

","When I was younger, I used to watch this show and be extremely confused on what was going on since I've seen it when season two first aired I think. But I didn't know anything about this show.

21 March 2019,Animany94,9," One I had never expected to be so awesome!
","I was so overwhelmed by how smart this series was. It quickly became one of my favourite TV-series, because of the multi-dimensional characters and the imaginative world built upon this computer operating system and the internet. Since ReBoot was the first fully computer animated TV-series I think it is genius to make build the world like that.",/review/rw1253056/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2020,timone-shimone,10," Slow start, but a work of art by season 2.
","Reboot is one of those must-see shows to appreciate how CG tv animation came to be and to watch how quickly that improved every season. Great writing, clever concepts, and complex characters with both heart warming and heart wrenching arcs for heroes and villains both. The show tone changes heavily from a childish season 1 (with straightforward and good writing) to maturing quickly through the seasons. It's just everything you ever want to see in a series comes full circle.",/review/rw1253056/?ref_=tt_urv

13 November 1999,culwin,8," Way better than ""BeastWars""
","The computer animation in this is incredible, and way better than ""Beast Wars"" in my opinion.  Actually, ""Beast Wars"" is really awful in my opinion. But this is about ReBoot - a great kids show with lots of ""in jokes"". Especially if you are a computer geek, you will get a lot of the computer references.  But ReBoot spoofs everything from ""Star Trek"", to ""The Pirates of Penzance"" to ""Army of Darkness"", making it great for adults, as well as kids.  Things really started to pick up speed when Enzo ""grew up"", everyone on the show got more personality, and the show got a much darker feel. Unfortunately, Mainframe Ent. ended the show in the 3rd season and won't be making anymore (with the way the show ended I don't think they could if they wanted to), so if you want to see anymore from Mainframe you will just have to watch Beast Wars (don't though).",/review/rw1253056/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2006,cathylovesmovies,10," One of the best children's shows ever made.

3 April 2018,david-m-fleisch,10," Groundbreaking for it's time, still relevant
","This show is an absolute gem. The characters are all caring ""people"" with interesting stories and histories. The animation was absolutely cutting edge for this time and although does not hold up today it more than makes up for it with it's content. Here's hoping that one day the cliffhanger gets resolved. This series if brought back still has a lot of life left in it and stories left untold.",/review/rw1253056/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2006,Translucid2k4,10," Charming and Groundbreaking Show
","""ReBoot"" was a strange little show in many ways. The first ever entirely CGI-Series, it was incredibly ground-breaking at the time for this fact alone. But it wasn't just that which made ""ReBoot"" so original. The whole premise for the show is very geeky, which is probably why it's initial massive success surprised so many people. You have to figure there is something more this show is offering the viewer, and there definitely is.",/review/rw1253056/?ref_=tt_urv

13 August 2000,jacgrunge,," The Granddaddy of CGI shows. (Beast Machines Spoiler)
","This is the first and best CGI show of all time.  It started off okay at first, but got better during the second season and peaked during the third season.  Coincedentally, the story is the same with Beast Wars.  That also seems to be the direction Beast Machines is headed, but according to Canadian sources, BM won't have a third season.

10 September 2006,lilacpilgrim-1,," Best CGI animation ever!
","I was about five or six when this came on ITV in Britain. I think my classmates were shocked that I would watch it - it was a given that action/adventure TV shows, especially set in a computer, were only for boys. Needless to say, I didn't care and continued to watch. Despite the fact that I had always been brought up to root for the good guy, my favourite characters ended up being the fearsome Megabyte and the creepy Hexadecimal. I think I wanted to be like Hexadecimal. Even at a young age, I was impressed and excited by the quality of the CGI - very impressive for its time. Unfortunately, then the amazing show stopped showing on ITV, never to be seen on UK TV again. You can imagine how upset I was. And you know? I think if ReBoot had still been showing while I was studying Higher Computing last year, I wouldn't have failed. Typical.",/review/rw1253056/?ref_=tt_urv
