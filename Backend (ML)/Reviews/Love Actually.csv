3 February 2023,llllllllora,4," Promising show with a disappointing ending.
","This show had a great concept-similar to 90 day fiancé, but mostly treated the cast with dignity-not like overly production-driven Jerry Springer sideshow characters. The people featured seemed more ""real"" than most reality show people.",/review/rw8827776/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2023,destiny_west,5," Wish's version of 90 Day Fiancé
","I feel bad for the title, honestly I do. I actually am enjoying the series. I think it just needs to have a few wrinkles ironed out and maybe it might come together better next season if there is one.",/review/rw8827776/?ref_=tt_urv
