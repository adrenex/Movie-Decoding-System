",Watched a show thee-utha-day... 'twas a funny one. The laidback lackies of Letterkenny lay low like little lazy lizards lickin' lemon lollipops. The gang gets together and gabs a good gob of gossip 'bout God's great gotta-git-ya's. And fists fly ferociously with force in fear that fickle fanatics will forget 'bout whose tough rough and buff enough. It's a good show I suppose...not one to talk down about a good show when I don't have one of m' own. Ten stars cuz I can't find a flaw in the production. Watch it if you'd like.,/review/rw4285129/?ref_=tt_urv

12 August 2018,tomfleming2470,10," This should be your new favorite show
","Recently discovered this show as it just came to the U.S. on Hulu. From the first beat of episode one I loved it. Fast paced dialogue by all of the characters in a small town in Canada. I have tried to persuade people to watch it by describing the characters as 'Kevin Smith's if Randall and Dante, etc... grew up in rural Canada instead of suburban New Jersey.' Some of the funniest dialogue I have heard in a long time. All of the cast are great and each character is uniquely odd in their own way. If you haven't given this sho a try yet, time to figure it out!",/review/rw4285129/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2018,dbrynnalyn,10," That's a Texas Sized 10-4
","This show is absolutely hilarious, full of dry humor and witty lines. I can't wait for Season 3. Very enjoyable, visit LetterKenny have a few drinks with the boys, admire the hot little sister and squirrely Dan's appreciation of her.",/review/rw4285129/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2018,jmaurer1-1,8," As an American I love this show!
","I'm a huge Corner Gas fan and have really grown to appreciate Canadian Comedy, and while this show is not family friendly at all, I love the style of humor and how fast paced it is. It is not hard to understand, so don't believe the bad reviews. Also, I have seen a lot of comments stating it's full of Canadian slang, and while that may be, it is very easy for Americans to understand. The first episode is the worst in my opinion, so just get past that and you will be fine.",/review/rw4285129/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2016,mattiaszw,10," Fantastic show with lots of heart
","This show is really something. The mixture of brutal simplicity with some top notch tongue-in-cheek writing really sets this show apart from virtually every comedy I've seen in the last few years. The jokes are crass yet eloquent, the situations absurd yet low key. ",/review/rw4285129/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2016,j_loome,9," Sharp, dry and dead-on satire of small-town Ontario
","It's just friggin funny, eh? From the angst-ridden small-town goth wannabes to the obviously flaming pastor to the hockey hair goons and the stoic farm boys, everyone drinks too much, fights too much and does a whole lot of nothing in Letterkenny. It takes small-town stereotypes and skewers the hell out of them, but doesn't stick to making fun of rural Canada, as the city folk get their comeuppance too. Principle topics of plots: sledding, drinking, hockey, fighting, religion, political correctness, weed and unemployment. If Trailer Park Boys is a slice of Canada's white trash culture, Letterkenny is a clever homage, explaining why so many people in the second-largest nation on Earth can drive hundreds of miles and still go nowhere.",/review/rw4285129/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2016,kleptomania,10," I don't know what to say...
","...other than how amazing this show is! After seeing the pilot, I rated the show a 9 but now that I've seen 6 episodes of it, I've been convinced to give it a 10.",/review/rw4285129/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is one of those times that my personal preferences won't bump-up or lower a rating .
I am not a fan of a many of the jokes but the delivery , the characters , the dialogue is super entertaining. The main character is immaculate,",/review/rw4285129/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2016,neil-levett,10," How are you now?
","I am always reluctant to wax lyrical to my friends about films or TV series' as I'd prefer them to go into the experience without massive expectations. Not with Letterkenny, I cannot big this up enough. I have just completed my second viewing of this 6 part series and am champing at the bit for the next instalment. The acting is superb but what makes this gem stand out is the writing, it is simply non stop, machine gun patter that is intelligent, authentic and most of all hysterical. As a Brit there were bits I caught on the second viewing that I'd missed the first time round due to the Canadian colloquialisms but that only increased the longevity for me. Although all the characters are well fleshed out, the stand out performance for me comes from Tyler Johnston who plays king of the meth heads, Stewart. Not taking anything away from the others but you see his character develop so well through the very short series. I sincerely hope this series gets the recognition, acclaim and popularity it deserves. I was lucky enough to go watch the the Arctic Monkeys in a tiny venue when they first started out, I hope I can say similar when Letterkenny gets massive.",/review/rw4285129/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2019,koytschubert,10," Where has this show been hiding?
",This show is like nothing I've ever seen and I absolutely love it. The writing is amazing. I binged all 6 seasons in 2 days and now I feel so empty inside. May rewatch the whole series again this weekend.,/review/rw4285129/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2017,JasonR77,10," Rapid-Fire Hilarity
","I discovered this show on YouTube, and I was laughing so hard during the Cold Open that I knew I had to watch all the episodes as quickly as possible. Jared Keeso's delivery and stone-face are terrific, and just about every line he has is hysterical.",/review/rw4285129/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2016,sthompson-90907,10," My compliments to the Chiefs
","Proud to be Canadian with productions like this. Way to go Jarrod and friends. The MacKenzie brothers would be proud of the notch you have taken our comedy to. Can't wait for season 2. Would love to see a blooper reel of takes - the sincere straight forward delivery would only lead to crack ups when tongues are twisted. Love the side kicks Daryl and Dan. Little sister is in control, but I worry about her taste in men. Gotta say Gail kills me, keep barking up Wayne's tree, he is bound to roll over. The hockey twins are classic and having a son around that age - well I just giggle and giggle. Final word- awesome. You have managed to take reality and creatively depict it in a very humorous way. good on ya eh.",/review/rw4285129/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2016,triplem33,9," Corner Gas meets Trailer Park Boys
","Just watched the first season and though it was hilarious. I did not realize it was set in Ontario...thought it was set out west...so Corner Gas meets Trailer Park Boys came to mind. Or perhaps the bazarro version of Corner Gas. The important things is that we finally have another Canadian show that reflects the real Canada...not the Avonlea, Murdock Mysteries hokum that represents...well...nothing really.

27 January 2019,brandenoller,10," Unbelievably hilarious show
",I'll keep it short and sweet. This show is filled to the brim with incredible and quotable dialogue. The characters are so outrageous and loveable. A must watch if you like quirky/ Canadian style humor.,/review/rw4285129/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2021,jennfinn,10," Pitter Patter
","I had never heard of Letterkenny until someone mentioned it in an Arrested Development Subreddit and said how funny it was. I'm sorry I put off watching it for so long because it is quite enjoyable. Thank goodness for subtitles because there are some things I would've missed without them. Jared Keeso as Wayne is top notch, Michelle Mylett plays his little sister, Katy and she's adorable. Daryl, Stewart, Reilly & Jonesy are funny as hell. My only complaint is Dan is kinda gross and Gail is creepy AF and a bit too much.",/review/rw4285129/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2020,tcbhughes,10," If I could give more stars I would... I hope this ride never ends!
",I discovered this show a couple of years ago and I love it. I hope it never ends. I wish I could find a man like Wayne and friends like the gang. These are such honest and humble characters that you can relate with. I love the snappy and funny dialogue that sometimes makes my head spin its so fervently delivered. This show makes me want to move to Letterkenny!,/review/rw4285129/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2019,rachelgallit,10," Texas Sized 10-4
","This is show is the epitome of well orchestrated dialogue, outlandish but not garish characters, and plot that interests a wide range of people: from fist fights, to farming, to pun-battles. Toughest man in town Wayne spearheads his little band of brothers, composed of his sister, his best friend, and a big lovable lug. The town is filled with fascinating people: the meth-heads, the hicks, the christians, and the normal folk. The protagonists are at once crude, drunken, assholes who goad each other into fights, and are throwing wit and hyperbolic puns out at the speed of light. It is a combination of the brilliant acting, crystal clear dialogue, and distinct and hilarious character types that make this show more than a tangled mess of conflict. This show likely misses much of the American audience, as the action and lines move at a speed and with such sharp changes that it is a little hard to follow without devoting ones full attention. The staging is both realistic and mundane and utterly manufactured, as it is almost a parody of a realistic situation played out in an exaggerated form.",/review/rw4285129/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2019,jsfrederick47,10," So's I was writing a review one daaayyyyy
","This show is amazing! The way the discuss topics has me rolling. My only suggestion, watch it with subtitles. Thick Canadian accents, unorthodox language, and a quick delivery is what makes this show a must watch.",/review/rw4285129/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2019,naterslater288,9," Some of the most memorbale quotes of all time.
","I have to say I was skeptical after watching the first episode but just stick with it and this series will have you crying with laughter. It moves quickly and there is almost no time to laugh at a joke before another one, or five are thrown directly in your face.
With some of the most memorable quotes/phrases iv'e heard since the movie ""Fletch"". I'd say this is one of if not my favorite comedy show. Give it a chance and make sure you have subtitles on as the jokes and speaking in general are very fast paced. You will probably find yourself rewinding on occasion just to catch the next joke in the illiteration bits but it doesn't matter, this show is downright hilarious. So, give your balls a tug and pitter patter.",/review/rw4285129/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2018,ebrailey22,8," Canadian Always Sunny
","If you like Always Sunny give this a try. A frienf of mine had me watch a few episodes and now I have five seasons to binge watch. It's Hicks, Hockey players, and Skids and their life styles coming together in a small town. And it's hilarious. It's really fast paced, witty, and some of the funniest insults/ comebacks I've ever heard. It's not outlandish like Always Sunny but the banter is pretty similar and the character development",/review/rw4285129/?ref_=tt_urv
