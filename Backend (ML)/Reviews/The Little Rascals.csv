","Just for the record, before those defending the film jump down my throat and start accusing me of all kinds of unfounded things like they have done with their tiresome, uncalled for and disgustingly condescending critic bashing, this review is not coming from a 'Transformers' detractor. Far from it actually oddly enough.",/review/rw3778320/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,3," Only this franchise could take something as inherently exciting as giant robots fighting and make it utterly dull.
","Despite all its spectacle, 'Transformers: The Last Knight (2017)' is simply completely mind-and-arse-numbingly boring. It's an utter chore to sit through from beginning to long-awaited end. It's also the kind of self-indulgent trite that goes in one ear and straight out of the other. Honestly, I felt as though I'd been sat in the cinema for years, never mind the already far too long two-and-a-half hours I actually had to endure this for. Not a single frame provided even a morsel of entertainment - which is weird because, for all intents and purposes, the admittedly impressive visual effects should've at least granted me some brief form of passive enjoyment during one of the over-blown action set-pieces. Yet, the takeaway I have from the picture is this: only Michael Bay (and his team, of course) could make something as inherently exciting as giant robots battling one another so painfully and utterly dull. 3/10.",/review/rw3778320/?ref_=tt_urv

22 June 2017,TheJediWay9,1," ""Transformers: The Last Knight"" Is Worse Than ""Age Of Extinction!""
","""Transformers: The Last Knight,"" the dreaded fifth movie in the  Transformers series is supposedly the last to be directed by Michael  Bay and the last to star Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg plays his character  Cade from the previous one. The ""attempt"" at a plot for this movie goes  something like this: Cade comes into possession of an ancient  Transformers artifact called the Talisman and he is the ""chosen one"" to  carry out a ""quest"" for the transformers, while this chick named Vivian  has to acquire Merlin's ""staff"" because for some reason she is the  ""only one who can wield it"" and Optimus Prime heads to Cybertron to  find out ""where he and the transformers came from and what they're  doing on earth."" THAT'S this movie's plot. Lol this movie thinks it has  a plot.   This movie is completely incapable of telling a cohesive story. There  is no beginning, middle, or end. It throws plot threads at you and  expects you to roll with them. The most illogical plot devices occur in  this movie. NOTHING makes any sense. It is so convoluted that the movie  thinks the audience are idiots. How many times was I reminded of what  the plot was throughout the entirety of this atrocity? I counted at  least 32. Nothing of importance happens. Nothing is interesting,  nothing is entertaining.   The characters are so thinly written and poorly developed I didn't care  who lived and who died. At this point in the series, I DON'T CARE ABOUT  THE DAMN HUMANS! Just give us a movie about Transformers, not about  humans. None of them are likable AT ALL. Everything involving the  military, the government, Anthony Hopkins, it's all pointless! The  movie spends so much time and energy on all the stuff everyone  complains about with these movies that none of it comes across as not  appealing, but rather annoying. It's an insult to our intelligence.   The action scenes are the same lazy action scenes the other four  Transformers movies feature. It's stuff that appeals only to teenagers  who do not know how a movie is crafted. Teenagers like action and  explosions and no talking, story, characters, or emotion. This movie  appeals to those teenagers. There I said it again. Watching stuff just  blow up and blow up and blow up and blow up and blow up and blow up  continuously for two and half hours is extremely boring, especially  since it's the only thing that has happened for five Transformers  movies in a row. There is no entertainment value to be had just  watching stuff blow up for a bloated and overlong runtime.  And yes, the runtime is too long, YET AGAIN. Luckily, it is shorter  than the fourth one which was a very drab and dreary two hours and  forty-five minutes. This is about fifteen minutes shorter, but it  easily could have been an hour shorter. Nothing content wise justifies  the runtime of this monstrosity. It's still overstuffed, overlong,  dreary, boring, and exhausting, just like the previous three. I'll give  the first one a pass since I actually enjoy the first one.   This has all the Bay-isms in it. The typical stereotypes, the typical  humor, and the typical dialogue, all of which is stupid, offensive, and  insulting. S many characters are made fun of in this movie for being  different or having different accents you thoroughly understand why  NOBDOY LIKES MICHAEL BAY. He is racist, sexist, and doesn't care about  the audience. He cares only about himself and no one else. It shows.  The two girls in this movie, in typical Michael Bay fashion, are all  hotted out. The young girl is like 14. In what world is this right? Her  tits just hang out the entire movie. The other chick just looks like a  porn star. That's what this series has come down to folks, strippers  and porn stars!  Optimus Prime is literally in the movie for ten minutes to just say his  name three times so that we don't forget about him and who he is and  completely forget that this movie gives him the most sudden shift in  character motivation I have ever seen, more sudden than Batman in  Batman V Superman. If you came to see him wreck house, he is a total  waste in this movie. Quite frankly, none of the Transformers really don  anything in this movie. They all just kind of hang out and chill and  insult each other with stereotypes.  This is one of the worst of the year. I felt like I lost IQ points  watching this movie. It is a loud, dumb, idiotic, incoherent, chaotic,  soulless mess that appeals only to teenagers who like nothing but  action and explosions and die hard fans of the series. It is worse than  Age of Extinction.   I'm just gonna give ""Transformers: The Last Knight"" an F-. Yes that is  now officially a grade.",/review/rw3778320/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Not impressed
","The best part of this movie is the action, the story was very lack luster. I think it had potential with a good cast including Anthony Hopkins, but the writting always falls short in these movies.

6 August 2017,pixiekatten,1," If only Age of Extinction ended with extinction so no one had to suffer this mess!
","Firstly, I do not rip on this movie because I dislike this franchise. I actually have a major soft spot for the Transformers movies. I love the cool visuals and the CGI. The first time I saw an autobot transform I was gobsmacked and in awe over how good the graphics were. These flicks are fast paced and action packed. And who does not fall head over heals for BumbleBee!? Transformers are good films for when you need to switch off from the outside world, and be seriously entertained for a couple of hours. Yes, even Age of Extinction has a few moments of goodness. The same unfortunately, cannot be said about this scrapheap of a film! ",/review/rw3778320/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2017,cruise01,10," A bit of the same but pure summer escapism of big loud action fun.
","Transformers: The Last Knight is yet again topped with loud big action and visual effects with little less on the plot. Nonetheless, it was awesome for what it is. Most of the Transformers movies by now have a recycled plot. Michael Bay is aiming to make a big summer blockbuster with lots of explosions between the autobots and decepticons. Even Paramount wants to open up this universe further with having a variety of writers tackle on for more movies. For now, this may be Michael Bays last outing with the franchise and he does go big.

31 August 2019,Leofwine_draca,5," All spectacle
","THE LAST KNIGHT is to date the most recent of the TRANSFORMERS franchise, excluding the BUMBLEBEE spin-off. It manages to be better than the original trilogy thanks to a shift away from lame comedy and juvenile hijinks towards a greater focus on epic-scale action a la the Marvel Universe. This time around, there's some half-hearted back story which seeks to tie the Arthurian legend into the Transformers universe (it never really works), which leads to the usual globetrotting and interplanetary adventures. Mark Wahlberg is on autopilot and supported by an unenthusiastic cast, with the exception of Anthony Hopkins, whose character seems to be exhibiting symptoms of early onset dementia. The voice cast (Buscemi, Goodman, Watanabe, etc.) is more interesting than the human cast. As usual, the saving grace are the special effects, which are exemplary and deliver CGI action which is all epic spectacle with barely time to draw breath.",/review/rw3778320/?ref_=tt_urv

This movie is empty, it is a 2 hours long advertisement of various car manufacturers and American military. Worst Transformers ever, please let this garbage just die and don't bother us with actors who just can not save this movie. It was just awful to watch, I couldn't believe the low quality dialogues and just the waste of money for junk CGI no one really cares about.

Not only does this film plummet the Transformers franchise even lower than Age of Extinction, (which I truly never thought was possible), but Transformers: The Last Knight (TLK) showcases an absolute abomination of film making in general, creating what essentially is a $200 million pile of steaming hot trash, a horrible disgrace to the Transformers name and the film industry as a whole.",/review/rw3778320/?ref_=tt_urv

25 June 2017,briangcb,," It's the fifth film, you know what you're getting by now.
","I rarely write reviews, but I'm actually surprised about how harshly this is getting bashed. Well, I'm not *that* surprised. All the Transformer films get eviscerated by critics. So I don't put much stock in reviews. All I'll say is; it's more of the same. If you like the previous 4 films, you'll like this one. I enjoy them all for what they are; cheesy popcorn movies. I personally think this film improves on Age of Extinction. Both Mark Wahlberg and Laura Haddock's characters had equally important roles. Unlike the first three films where Sam was always ""The Chosen One"" and his girlfriend's job was to just run in slow motion yelling ""SAAAAAM!"". The main group of Decepticons were actually given personalities and unique identities. Though completely under- utilized. They make a big deal of giving them Suicide Squad-like introductions and their screen time amounts to maybe 45 seconds each. I was actually surprised how much screen time Anthony Hopkins had. I figured he'd slum it for two or three scenes, of exposition, grab his paycheck then disappear. But he's actually a prominent character and he seemed to have a lot of fun in the role.",/review/rw3778320/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2017,lark40,10," a reshaping your legend a hero with as bug secret that changes how we see him on his world or ours a war defines everything can we find the true leader and change history
","Writer Matt Holloway is a fan of the drama Downton Abbey (2010), and jokingly said that Jim Carter (who plays the butler Mr Carson in the show) should voice Cogman . He was shocked when director Michael Bay got Carter on as Cogman Isabella and her lovable robot that nobody cares for only her is a blast there is an emotional bonding going with cade as he asks him about his daughter there USA story in Michael bays film which is good as we have another new comer Laura haddock she is a university professor who show the history to kids about everything she has a hidden secret only for Sir Edmund Burton who gurads a past to help keep humanity safe follow her because she will be needed to help the world from becoming cybertron the impressive Alnwick Castle, he has a robot butler called cog man who is very good but sarcastic humour I really don't have much else to say. As stated above, it's the fifth film, you've already made up your mind whether you want to see it or not. If the negative reviews have put you on the fence or dissuaded you, think about whether or not you enjoyed the last four films. If yes, then ignore the critics and enjoy yourself. what can i say from a Michael bay transformers his story has an actual story line and he gets the best story of the lot and good acting from his cast with Anthony Hopkins he gets an actual good story to tell Michael bay is given his lead actors and reamigining of the Arthur and the knights of the round tables with the transformers been involved so we kinda gets another king Arthur of the summer and also ww2 story in there two this film is 2hrs25mins long and a closing credit sequence just in case the make another like the rumored bumblebee spin off Anthony Hopkins character has been guarding a secret so the decepticions his character shows a bit of comic timing don't get the it hands on a so we see mark whalberg back as cade Yeager minding his robots at a junk yard the film takes place in parts in Chicago mostly in London and Africa. its a nice welcome from America getting hit to spread it out as a globally war Autobots and Decepticons are at war, with humans on the sidelines. we see Merlin his mystical power but he comes good as Arthur in medieval times losing the battles but we see the dragon from the artifact that Merlin's has been given so its lost to time and nobody knows where the artifact as mega tron is on the lookout for it as as we see barricade give cade a special item as we as we see the josh duhamels character is group take down the transformers comes to alliance with cade as they find his group in the out of bounds part of Chicago but strange things hap-ping to optimums we see the army helping mega tron find cade follow him to a little town as as they give chase and battles the other auto bots as well as drones so cog man get cade o his plane to England to help his search as the police give chase to him in London as wheels brings the professor and Edmond Burton to explain his mythology and secrets he keeping but all these stories make sense as there is 12 robots guarding a secret as we see the the group get to a submarine this sequence is impressive underwater to a ship of importance that leads to an all out assault in Stonehenge with everyone gathering the support the flying sequence the action are top notch with cybertron here on earth like the way they tried in transformers 3 this time they succeed please Michael bay come back when you have another story there police chases through London submarine chases as well this film has everything Optimus Prime is gone to search for his maker he comes across the dead cybertron and quintessa is going to play her cards right and get the artifact. The key to saving our future lies buried in the secrets of the past, in the hidden history of Transformers on Earth. Unlike the first three films where Sam was always ""The Chosen One"" and his girlfriend's job was to just run in slow motion yelling ""SAAAAAM!"".

21 August 2020,maxglen,3," The Worst Edited Film I've Ever Seen
","This film is a failure in practically all aspects. Honestly, I have no idea how a film with this high of a budget can be as incompetent as it is. Editing. Editing is basically everything when shipping your film out to audiences, it can mean the difference between a good film and a great one. But this... I don't want to sound dramatic but The Last Knight has around 4 aspect ratios and I'm not exaggerating when I say it switches between them at least every other shot. It's headache inducing. This wouldn't be too unforgivable if they let a shot go on for longer than 3 seconds but I swear there are so many cuts, one movement or action has about 5 cuts each, it's ridiculous. When it comes to story this film is essentially the polar opposite to the previous four. Transformers is usually beaten on for having extremely surface level, unambitious stories whereas The Last Knight has FAR too much going on, I'm not even going to try and touch on all the things it tries and fails to do. The dialogue is the worst in the franchise (Yes... worse than RotF) with some truly cringe worthy humour and attempts at making characters likeable which in turn does the complete opposite. Every character in this film is abysmal. Also, they brought back a bunch of the original cast just to have them do either virtually nothing or something literally anyone else can do, really felt like they were just trying to pander to fans of the original. The film also manages to have a villain even more useless and boring than the Fallen which is bewildering and speaking of villains, Megatron basically isn't even Megatron, he's a complete lackey and a betrayal of the character they had built up over the franchise. The world building is pointless and ridiculous, literally none of it works which would be bad enough if they weren't shoving it in your face at every opportunity, which they do. The film also introduces the interesting concept of an Evil Optimus in the form of Nemesis Prime, but don't get too excited because he has one scene and then he's back to being Optimus again. And Unicron? Probably the coolest Transformer ever, originally voiced by freakin' Orson Welles?! This film manages to make him not cool. How do you mess up a giant Transformer that eats planets?! this is Galactus from Rise of the Silver Surfer all over again. Finally, the action which had been the saving grace in some of the weaker entries, is tosh. It's really boring. But even if it had the action of John Wick it wouldn't save it from being practically unbearable to sit through in one sitting, I actually had to take breaks. 3/10 Just...
