28 February 2020,cardsrock,7," Effective thrills, but with some logic issues
","I really enjoyed the first 2/3 of this film. They are filled with palpable tension and a general unease at not being able to see the ""monster."" This is another example of how what you cannot see is often scarier than what you can see. The direction is great and perfectly places the viewer in Elizabeth Moss' shoes, which is what generates most of the tension as you the viewer are also unsure where this invisible person is at all times. The spin of domestic violence also lends a new, modern twist on the classic premise.",/review/rw6810538/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2020,killercharm,7," what a difference a talented director makes
",The previous versions of this movie left me not expecting much but what a difference a talented director makes. In this story of the man who discovers a way to render himself invisible the tension is kept taut all the way. I was roped in immediately. The cast is spot on - both the casting and acting is great. While the special effects are beautifully fluid they are not overwhelming. A great ride.,/review/rw6810538/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2020,johnral321,7," good movie; not as many plot holes as people say
","I'm surprised at the number of highly negative reviews on here. Most of them pertain to plot issues. I'm all for exposing plot holes, but most of these could be easily explained with a little creativity. Just some examples: People complain that the antagonist has super-human strength. This is not the case at all. He has the advantage of the element of surprise. A moderately strong (invisible) male could lift a female in the air, and could toss her across a table; and could beat the crap out of bigger dudes. People complain about the third suit: But there could have been ten suits, and he could have lost track of a suit. People complain about the dog being at the house; but for all we know she lost track of the dog on the night of her escape and the dog returned to the house later. People complain that she would not risk her plan by taking the dog with her; but it would be simple enough to take the dog with her and meet her sister in the road, while her husband sleeps. People complain about how he gets around: but his brother could drive him; or he could jump on a bus and hide; or he could just take off the suit and drive around like a normal person; or he could put on a wig and makeup. People complain about the guards not defending themselves better; but they have never encountered an invisible man before and would not know what is going on. People complain at her reaction in the restaurant; but she would be in shock and there's no telling how a person would react to that. Some people complain about how quickly the Uber driver arrives; but the scene does show her looking at her phone (and the Uber app), and we don't know how much time has elapsed before this time. (It's possible that she was running and hiding in the neighborhood for 5 minutes.) Maybe the husband developed the suit at a research facility and made a few extra suits for himself and took them home. I'm not saying there are no plot holes, but the complaints here are far too harsh, and lack imagination. The movie is novel, suspenseful, and interesting, and well-acted. (This is not exactly a plot-hole, but wouldn't a DNA test on the fetus prove that it was his son, and thereby implicate him in the crimes? The brothers weren't twins.)",/review/rw6810538/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2021,bob-the-movie-man,8," Have you seen ""The Invisible Man""?
","Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) is trapped in a highly controlling and violent relationship with technology mogul Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen). Escaping from his fortress-like home, she lives in fear of his retribution. So she is much relieved, if a little surprised, at the report of his suicide. Now living with old friend James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) and his teenage daughter Sydney (Storm Reid), Cecilia can finally start to relax. But as strange things start to happen, is the ghost of Griffin back to haunt her? Or is it really all in her rapidly disintegrating mind, as her sister Emily (Harriet Dyer) and James suspect?",/review/rw6810538/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2020,Bertaut,4," Starts brilliantly but ultimately undermines itself with plot contrivances and genre foolishness
","H.G. Wells's original The Invisible Man (1897) suggests that rather than something as powerful as invisibility being used for the betterment of mankind, it would instead be used to fulfil private desires, ultimately leading to the moral corruption of otherwise good men. In probably the best cinematic adaptation, ",/review/rw6810538/?ref_=tt_urv

10 May 2020,Lejink,3," Nothing To See
","A woman furtively leaves her marital bed at dead of night in a hill-top, bay-view, hi-tech luxury mansion. She gets away from her soon-pursuing husband by the skin of her teeth and we soon learn in the aftermath that said husband was a control-freak, obsessively watching her every move. And if you look carefully, also that he's seriously into optics and the like, remember that, it's important. Next thing, she's told by hubby's lawyer brother that he's been killed and she's been left his fortune. So she moves in with her cop pal and his college-age daughter and in relief, starts splashing the cash, but somehow she just can't shake the feeling that her old man is still around and actually isn't dead at all.",/review/rw6810538/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2020,Kdosda_Hegen,3," Just lame.
","This film was a disappointment. While the action scenes were great, the storyline is terrible. Tons of questions instantly come to mind like: Why are there no cameras in restaurant? How did the dog survive being in the empty house alone for so long and why was he left alone in the first place? There's plenty more, but they'd go into spoiler territory. Anyway this film plays it too safe. Simple twists, no loose ends. Just mediocre.",/review/rw6810538/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2020,lnvicta,8," As good as a modern Invisible Man movie can be.
","Leigh Whannell is not a subtle filmmaker - at least, that's what I used to think. The Saw and Insidious movies are over-the-top and shocking, which is fine, and I enjoyed Upgrade quite a bit, but I was afraid the Invisible Man would fall into the same trap of shock-value over substance. Thankfully, I was wrong.",/review/rw6810538/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2020,neetabora,4," Plotholes larger than moon's craters
","The guy puts on a suit, becomes invisible to irritate his wife. So there's no ghost but a man in suit. Then how did he commute? He's covering long distances to follow her everywhere. How is that possible for an invisible guy? Is he driving - but there was no sign of his car? If brother is driving him around - Where is his car too? Is nobody noticing a car with no driver?
It would be so easy for a crazy guy like him being invisible to tie her down one night, throw in his car & take her away instead of playing with her quilts.
In one scene, she got hold of another suit which she could wear & become invisible herself. Won't that make more sense?
But she locked it in house & ran back only to come back later for then end stunt.
One more point - roads have CCTV but not a hospital. Howcome receptionists don't see anything or call 911.
Very unthoughtful movie.",/review/rw6810538/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2020,Leofwine_draca,7," Pretty good effort
","THE INVISIBLE MAN is another pretty good sci-fi/horror movie combo from Leigh Whannell, whose previous effort, UPGRADE, was similarly enjoyable. This turns out not to be a remake of the Universal classic at all but rather a look at abusive relationships and gaslighting. A lot of the goodwill comes from Whannell's understated directorial style and Elizabeth Moss's performance, which is very strong and very physical. It's a slightly overlong production with one twist too many for my liking, but there's plenty of suspense punctuated by the occasional set-piece (including a TERMINATOR 2-inspired bit in a mental hospital which is really good) that makes this work a treat.",/review/rw6810538/?ref_=tt_urv

","Mad scientist is also an abusive stalker. Starting when Cecelia gets away from the abusive stalker, she nonetheless continues to be impacted by the echoes of the emotional abuse. But these aren't echoes. Elizabeth Moss does well to turn the woman of domestic violence into one of psychological breakdown. She keeps the movie engaging. Whannell manages the direction of this film well (he also wrote the story and screenplay). He frames shots expertly to give empty space a personality.

Cecilia claims that Adrian is an abusive husband and Emily´s friend Police Detective James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) lodges her at home in the room of his daughter Sydney Lanier (Storm Reid).

24 March 2020,Her-Excellency,6," Mixed Feelings on the Subject of Domestic Abuse
","While I understand that every person is different and reacts differently to different situations, the scared-as-a-mouse performance by Elizabeth Moss upon leaving the relationship, to me, was just not believable. It takes A LOT to leave a relationship which has become as abusive and controlling as the one that was alluded to in this film. By the time one is emotionally ready to walk out, generally, you've been through all the pain, the doubts ... the weakness; by the time one has been driven to stand up and leave, generally, there is nothing as frightening ""out there"" as staying IN the relationship would be, and there is NOTHING more empowering than the moment you step out of that door KNOWING that it is the last time you will ever allow yourself to go back. Now, again, I understand, and would like the reader to understand, that this is just my opinion. For others it may be different and very well may be as was depicted in the film, where the recovery process takes a while longer and during that time the survivor still feels emotionally or physically vulnerable and at risk. Either way, people (I won't define by gender because there are men who are abused too) who find their legs and leave a situation such as this, sooner or later do discover that they are indeed among the strongest on earth.",/review/rw6810538/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2020,garethvk,9," A Genre Defining Example Of Making A Quality Horror Film
","Cecilia Kass (Elizabeth Moss) is a woman living in fear. Despite living a life of wealth and privilege in a seaside home; she is ready to take drastic steps in her life.
Cecilia is trying to escape from her controlling and abusive husband who despite being considered a wealthy genius in the field of Optics; has made her life a living hell and forces her to make a daring escape that has her barely getting away with the help of her sister Alice (Harriett Dyer).
The film picks up two weeks later where Cecilia is hiding with a friend of her sister Officer James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) and his daughter Sydney (Storm Reid). Cecilia is scared to even leave the house and do simple tasks such as checking the mailbox and is livid when her sister comes to visit as she is sure that her husband will find her by tracking her Sister.
Alice informs Cecilia that her husband has killed himself and she is now free to live without fear. Cecilia gets a letter informing her that she is to receive 100K a month to the sum of five million dollars as part of her husband's will. The fact that nobody should have her mailing address does seem odd to her as does that fact that the estate is being handled by her ex's brother Tom (Michael Dorman).
With her new wealth Cecilia gifts James and also sets up a school fund for Sydney and begins to emerge from her shell.
It is around this time that unusual things begin to happen to her. A lost item from the night of her escape shows up and a mysterious kitchen fire starts. Cecelia also wakes up to find the covers off the bed and what appears to be something unseen standing on the blankets when she attempts to pull them up.
When she expresses her concerns to James that her husband is alive and exacting revenge, both he and Tom ignore her and when things begin to escalate, Cecilia is the one who starts to look more and more unstable as the tormenting continues and her life spins out of control.",/review/rw6810538/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2020,MR-ODIN,," Great
","I loved this movie so much. I loved Elisabeth Moss's performance if her acting didn't work then we wouldn't believe there is an invisible man but she sells it. I like the cinematography in the movie, I love it when they move the camera to a random spot in the room and we think the invisible man is there and them kinda showing he's somewhere in the room with her, which creates a lot of tension in the scenes. I love the tension in each scene and they do a very good job of capturing tension throughout the whole movie. They have an absolutely stacked cast and they all do an amazing job. I think they did a pretty job at the score it really worked in the tension of the scenes and it elevated each scene and the whole movie and it flowed with each scene it never felt off at all. I felt so bad for the character of Elisabeth Moss because the evidence is right there and the doctors aren't believing her, and everything that happens to her too. They do an amazing job at fleshing out the character of James who is played by Aldis Hodge he also does an amazing job and I cared about him so much throughout the whole story. The story kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish, and it kept me wanting to learn more or see what was going to happen next. I only have two problems with the movie a bit of the dialogue is bad at times and there are times where the decisions that were made were not logical at all besides that I think it is pretty good. Overall I loved it and would recommend it to anyone.",/review/rw6810538/?ref_=tt_urv

28 February 2020,masonsaul,9," Incredible psychological horror
","The Invisible Man is an incredible psychological horror that's extremely tense, scary and timely. Elisabeth Moss gives an incredible lead performance and both Aldis Hodge and Storm Reid give great supporting performances. Leigh Whannel's direction is incredible, effectively utilising empty spaces to build suspense and using the same style he used for Upgrade for the excellent action sequences. The use of sound is also great and helps build suspense. It's expertly paced and the music by Benjamin Wallfisch is amazing. However, its brought down slightly by one predictable twist.",/review/rw6810538/?ref_=tt_urv

","Good story plot and a well direction makes this movie watchable till the end with suspense even some flaws having with. A woman flees away from her hubby due to avoid motherhood. Later she came to know that he died but he is haunting her still invisibly. What is the end ? You have to watch this suspense and science fiction thriller. However there is no explanation about invisible suit then one can confused. But movie is watchable. Acting by leading lady is perfect makes you linking the movie. Movie theme based on looks like some bollywood movies i.e. Do gaz zameen ke neeche, Main zaroor aunga, Agni sakshi, Darar and hollywood like Sleeping with enemy etc but in different and better way.
