9 April 2021,JShaft33,7," Jordan Peele, is that you?
","Imagine my surprise when after 5 episodes in I realized that this was not a Jordan Peele show/production. The cinematography, acting, angels, score, etc. Are right off the cutting room floor of Get Out & Us. I thought there were some creepy moments and the costumes were quite good. This is also for fans of Ryan Murphy (American Horror Story) or even some Tales from the Crypt/Twilight Zone.",/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2021,CJXzoic1970,8," Peel back the layers and see what you find.
","For me definitely it's deep and thought provoking. Very relevant dealing with racism, trauma, mental health, systematic equalities, so much more all wrapped into a tv series. At times its over the top but overall highly recommended! Some say it's regurgitated racist stereotypes that we need to move on from but personally I feel they aren't talked about enough. Real slavery and Jim Crow was worse. This series after Jordan Peele's rise and Spike Lee's legacy are just the tipping point in bringing these stories to the forefront.",/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2021,turtleloverules,10," I finished watching this in one sitting.
",I hope amazon/sony makes more programming about strong black families. The movie is a great history lesson and still relevant today.,/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2021,kevin_robbins,10," This is probably the best addition to the horror genre in 2021
","Them (2021) is a series my fianc√©e and I wrapped up last weekend on Amazon Prime. The storyline takes place in the early 1950s as Los Angeles was really thriving and black Americans started moving to the predominantly white Compton. Unfortunately for one family the house they move into is both haunted and surrounded by racist white people, with problems of their own, that will stop at nothing to keep their area without diversity.",/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2021,johannes2000-1,9," Very strong, but extremely heavy to watch.
","This is definitely not a pleasant watch: it is more or less like a 10 episodes long punch in the belly. The story tells of the unrelenting discrimination of a black family that moves into a white suburban neighborhood in the US, around the 50's. Things deteriorate, the neighbors gradually work themselves up to a murderous frenzy, while the besieged black family desperately tries to cope with all of this, until eventually they break and start fighting back.",/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2021,tidymuso49,9," Unexpectedly ended up marathoning THEM on Prime
","Didn't know anything about this TV series but I thought I would watch something before my Prime subscription ended. I sat watching from beginning to end on the edge of my couch. It was disturbing, menacing, emotional and beautiful. All the actors were just incredible the soundtrack was amazing the storyline was a breath of fresh air. Them was visually stunning and thought provoking to watch, I didn't want it to end.",/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2021,nishil-patel1,7," Great start but...
","This series starts off so well - the storyline was very real and the story-telling was carefully planned and executed but.. by the time you reach episode 6-7 the story heads in a very odd direction. The illusions take over the plot, to the extent that it sometimes becomes difficult to differentiate what's real from the illusion.",/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2021,wandernn1-81-683274,8," A Lot Like American Horror Story... Dark.
",Rewatched A 2nd time and Season 1 was pretty damn good. I paid a lot closer attention this time. But I enjoyed the end and the creepiness factor the 2nd time through was even better. Giving it a little bump to 8/10,/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2021,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,9," Exceptional TV horror series 2021.
","This is the best horror series I have seen so far this year (2021). It is exceptionally well written and well acted. If you were to strip out the psychological horror elements, you would still have a solid thriller.",/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2021,nicci1972,10," The horror is these circumstances are still relevant
","This is for the people writing negative reviews 1 or 2 episodes in; can you even write a fair review? You are entitled to your opinion but if you are not willing to be objective enough to complete it then you should not waste your time. Very well shot, sequenced and acted. Plot was scary without the ""supernatural"". This is hard to watch like The Handmaids Tale but even more difficult because it's true. Racism like this has happen and does happen. So sad.",/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2021,brah_vo,5," Ok- Don't think I'd watch again
",I gave this a few days to digest and take it what I watched. Overall it was not bad BUT also not good. I just got too invested and had to finish.,/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv

","Started bright, continued awesome, ended philosophically fantasized.",/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2021,dwestlow,5," Started ok, became slow and strange...
","There is a lot happening in this show. It starts well and is easy to follow....but as it moves forward it is very difficult to make sense of what is actually happening. By the end of it we found ourselves asking ""what did it all mean""? One scene can be broken up into 2 or 3 timelines or universes. It's extremely choppy which makes it difficult to assess and make any sense of. It extremely disappointing as the trailer looked fantastic. Watch it and make up your own mind. Ultimately it was a massive let down after such high expectations.",/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv

",I see the rateing are so wrong i cant understand why? This is as good as an old horror fan can hope for. Its creepy.,/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2021,billindalex,9," Horrifying on Multiple Levels
","After having watched the first three episodes I find this series horrifying. It makes me feel terrible and sad and scared while at the same time hopeful that somehow things will work out for the family, though I have a desperate dread that it won't. Some reviews say the producers took racism too far. Unfortunately, I think, in actuality, it was much much worse.",/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2021,nativextisc,10," Unexpectedly AMAZING
","Im truly surprised by the low ratings but then i read their comments. I guess the truth hurts. Seems to also strike a nerve in the nonbelievers of racism, and the effects it has psychologically on those who have suffered generations of trauma. I dont know about you but this series made me want to jump in my TV and legitimately ring necks lol. Im suggesting it to everyone. You guys did an amazing job with this.",/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2021,danielthompsonfp,7," Episode Five. Enough Said!
","There are incredibly few films that have left my jaw on the floor, and this series did just that. However it didn't just cause me to do it once, but over, and over, again.",/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv

11 April 2021,grubenstier,10," Now THIS, is the true American Horror Story!
","A bit too graphically violent for me at times. Nevertheless, I could not stop watching. I binge-watched the series in 2 days. The -Tap Dance Man- & -Epps- characters are truly mesmerizing. A real-life American Horror Story!",/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv

6 May 2021,seansoulo73,3," Sorry, not feeling this one!
","The acting is superb no doubt, but the story is way too far fetched. The new film genre has emerged since Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" that is a mix of racially charged dramedy and horror. I'm old enough to have seen white flight in the 70's and 80's in Los Angeles, but ""Them"" is based in the 1960's...a little before my time. However, the storyline here revolves around anti-integration, racist, white folks, driving black, upwardly mobile families crazy enough to the point where they murder, maim and mutilate themselves. It's ridiculous and way too weird. Not to mention the scatterbrain, mixed up storylines.",/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2021,johnsudduth1,7," Don't trust the 1 star or 10 star reviews.
","The fact of the matter is that if you liked Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" or ""Us"", you will most likely enjoy this series as it has many stylistic similarities. The show has interesting characters, good directing, good acting and is genuinely creepy at times.",/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv

17 June 2021,UniqueParticle,10," Masterful horror!
","Deeply unsettling, brilliant and enthralling! I'm so glad I decided to watch Them it's a perfect thrill ride that is well made despite mainly being about racism. I was curious when I first saw a trailer for the series but at the time I was into other shows or gaming. Quite intrigued for more of anything by the creators and what the rest of the episodes are like.",/review/rw7037627/?ref_=tt_urv
