15 October 2020,jackdog1-1,10," If Only This Was Realty
",If only this was reality. It's pretty amazing that the so many of the original cast come together as if no time at all has passed. Sterling K. Brown deftly steps in for the late John Spencer and the rest of the cast inhabit their characters exactly the same way they did 14 years ago. The lack of the original sets in favor minimal sets and no efforts to hide the theater in which they are working works quite well. It all makes me miss it and glad that it's available to stream whenever I need a fix.,/review/rw6257614/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2021,malcolmjohnston,9," Just a reminder of how good this show was
","In the build up to the showing of this
I was quite sceptical as so much time had past since the West Wing had left our screens but with the genius of Aaron Sorkins writing and the pure class of the old team making this possibly the best one off show during the COVID-19 pandemic
Just truly wonderful seeing all the favourites reprise there classic roles
Cregg/ Lyman for 2025 anyone???",/review/rw6257614/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2020,catdogmanfish,10," Wonderful
","Absolutely incredible reunion, and run through of an iconic episode. Everyone is in their top form for this special, it's wonderful seeing all our favorite characters together again. Sterling K. Brown is a good stand in for the late great John Spencer, he approaches the role as Leo McGarry with reverence and respect. All the cameos from various celebrities and dignitaries is very well done, and all the information given on voting is flawlessly executed. My only lament is many of the people who should watch this will not.",/review/rw6257614/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2020,rossarntson,9," Why only HBOMax?
",This was too important and too poignant to be limited to HBO Max. Should have been on public TV for all to see.,/review/rw6257614/?ref_=tt_urv

16 October 2020,laughran17,10," The Right Way to do a West Wing Reunion
","A West Wing reunion is definitely not going to sway any independent or unlikely voters because they're really not the audience of the show, but damn it was still very well done. And like Bradley Whitford said at the top of the show, if it gets on more person to the polls then it's worth it. Or maybe it gets one person who watched to volunteer and they get someone to the polls.",/review/rw6257614/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2021,breeanalaine,10," Face hurts from smiling
","What a total joy. This could've been a car crash (as many show reunions are) but instead it was like catching up with an old friend. Visually stunning, just beautifully put together. Congrats to the entire cast, Aaron, Tommy, and Snuffy.",/review/rw6257614/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2020,jwrasse,10," A tremendous, timely production
","Even with a pandemic, the cast and crew of The West Wing united for a beautiful retelling of a classic episode. Interspersed with touching calls to action and shot superbly with coronavirus mitigation measures in place, this special beckons us to expect the best-from our entertainment, from our country, and from ourselves.",/review/rw6257614/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2020,mrsallwood,10," Made me nostalgic
","It made my heart so happy to see not just all of these great actors, but the CHARACTERS too! It was hard for me to get through without John Spencer, but Sterling K. Brown was fantastic. I think I'll re-watch the series this weekend! Thank you Aaron Sorkin, Thomas Schlamme, the cast, and the crew. My heart really is so happy!",/review/rw6257614/?ref_=tt_urv

1 May 2021,kosmasp,9," Reaching out - voting matters
","Like many beloved tv shows, fans want to get them back - see all those beautiful individuals in their respective roles. In this case we can look behind the curtain (literally) and have an episode retold in a way that we have not seen before - as a play on stage. Of course one of the most beloved individuals of the show has passed - while making the show back then. He is being replaced here by another fine actor as we learn at the beginning of the show.",/review/rw6257614/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2020,chris-57822,10," It's time for President Seaborn
","West Wing is an all-time favorite of mine. Me and my wife binge watch the entire series once a year. I hope that this recent special has reignited Aaron's creative juices. Bartlett mentions it right in the episode....""Sam, you're going to run for President one day. Don't be scared. You can do it. I believe in you."" It's time to bring back The West Wing-President Seaborn edition!!!!!!!! Who concurs???",/review/rw6257614/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,estathena2,10," Inspirating
",It is sadly telling that a reading of a past episode from a beloved show could upset a petulant few while inspiring the many - the fans who watched & sought solace in The West Wing during a dark and troublesome time.,/review/rw6257614/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2020,markentertainment,8," Democrat focus
","The series was a staple growing up and this series has previously tacked current political issues (I know the name but out of respect I would rather speak ambiguously than mis spell the episode name).
Years have past and honestly the performances are still spot on, Martin Sheen might have been a good candidate.
This was good in respect to re kindling a relationship with the characters of times past but I felt this was without signage a pro Democrat push, I could be wrong but the way actors were scripted anti trump also having no republican representation didn't help this claim.
It's worth a watch if you liked the series, Martin Sheen just nails that role as they all did and in that alone it's worth a watch.
I'm not from the USA and I only look at this unbiased so represent my own opinion of the stimuli.",/review/rw6257614/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2020,schappe1,8," A nice effort
",I re-watched the original episode and this is a good re-telling of it with a laudable mission of getting out the vote. Presenting it on stage with no audience and minimal sets was well handled and I didn't miss the old sets. The actors from the show slipped into their old roles like riding a bicycle.,/review/rw6257614/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2020,markl47,8," Great show! But hardly non-partisan
","I loved West Wing when it was on, and this stage throwback is wonderful! But trying to spin this as non-partisan is laughable. All the messages in between acts are about as biased as you can get and basically say ""Vote Democrat!"" Let's be honest and call it what it is, a nice gift to the Left.",/review/rw6257614/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2020,kmdomel,6," Well-acted reunion, great episode, glaringly promoting the Democratic agenda
","Loved seeing the cast. Beautifully acted episode, but if you are going to say it is just about voting and bipartisan 1) a Republican president should have been included, 2) talking about issues should include issues on both sides and 3) Samuel L Jackson's section should have been rewritten. As Bradley said at the beginning, we find it offensive when actors preach to the rest of us. I would have enjoyed it so much more if they kept their personal politics out of it.",/review/rw6257614/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2020,flash-104,9," A Magnificent Party Campaign Contribution
","The vintage Aaron Sorkin is back, suppressing the heavy-handedness he showed in politically correcting _To Kill a Mocking Bird_. Magnificent drama, focusing on political (as Mr Lowe notes) inspiration. But to call it nonpartisan reveals a troubling epistemic bubble, where it is apparently unthinkable to be uneasy about abortion, or about federal regulation of voting in the south but not, for instance, Massachusetts. Anointing the Associated Press as the supposedly non-partisan arbiter of election results, given its recent Style Guide mandates favoring Senator Harris, was a particularly Orwellian touch.",/review/rw6257614/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2020,courtneyjjjjjjjj,9," Wonderful

17 October 2020,billy-kantharidis20,," Brilliant Reenactment, non-partisan not so much
","This is a beautiful reenactment of one of the most brilliant shows ever to grace TV. To see the cast back together although not complete was heartwarming. However, the entire production tripped itself up in a key element of this reunion. Near the beginning Rob Lowe and Allison Janney inform the audience that this is created in the spirit of the organisation 'When we all Vote,' apparently a non-partisan org. This couldn't be more partisan if it tried. From the attempts to present subtle democratic messages about 'Orangemanbad' to the use of celebrity more or less infomercials, it makes me cringe to see a show that used to be about a reasonable and fair democratic administration try to promote the rubbish the democrats have become today. Could have and should have been a lot better but I guess we live in an age where Hollywood can't seperate itself from the far-left.",/review/rw6257614/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2020,jmutch-68707,9," Amazing Reunion and Rendition of a Classic Episode
","The cast and crew of The West Wing did not disappoint when reuniting for the 2020 election season. The only performance which I didn't not love as much as the original is Sterling's. In my eyes, no one but John Spencer will ever be Leo McGary.",/review/rw6257614/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2020,neilchubbybell,10," If only they knew
","Amazing second act of a great episode but the irony of the interjected special guests talking about why, how and the need to vote...omg if only they knew.",/review/rw6257614/?ref_=tt_urv
