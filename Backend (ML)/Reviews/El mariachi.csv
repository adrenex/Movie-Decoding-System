2 May 2004,bob the moo,," A good gangster film with strong emotional under currents
","In the late 1970's, FBI agent Joe Pistone poses as jewel expert Donnie Brasco to win the trust of ageing mob middleman Lefty Ruggiero.  As time passes Donnie gets tighter and tighter into the mob, rising up when boss Sonny Black gets bumped up.  While Donnie puts his life at risk, his real life crumbles as he never sees his wife or children.  As he moves upwards, his friend Lefty is bypassed time and time again.  As Donnie gets deeper, the FBI start to worry and want to extract him - something that cannot be done without exposing himself and condemning Lefty to death.",/review/rw8122351/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2003,barnabyrudge,," An absorbing, well made gangster movie.
","Mike Newell is the weirdest choice for director of a Mafia drama, but he actually makes a terrific fist of it, delivering one of the very best gangster movies ever made. Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Anne Heche and Michael Madsen are all in top form in front of the camera, too.",/review/rw8122351/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2006,lee_eisenberg,8," one scene really gives us a leg up on everything
","On one level, ""Donnie Brasco"" might just look like another mafia movie. But it's not. It tells the story of FBI agent Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp), who in the late 1970s was hired to infiltrate the mafia. So, he got acquainted with hit-man Benjamin ""Lefty"" Ruggiero (Al Pacino). But lo and behold, Joe got too much into the mafia lifestyle, to the point where it dominated his life and kept him from his family. And no one ended up with a very good reward at the end.",/review/rw8122351/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2004,rbverhoef,8," Depp and Pacino in terrific movie
","For some reason a Johnny Depp movie is always interesting. Whether it is a biopic about Ed Wood, a dark fairy tale about a man with scissors instead of hands, a movie about the greatest lover the world has ever known or a adventurous story about pirates, Depp's performance alone makes it worth seeing. Here he plays FBI-agent Joe Pistone who goes undercover using the name Donnie Brasco. He becomes a wiseguy with the help of Lefty (Al Pacino), who is sort of a loser wiseguy who desperately needs to be a mentor because most of his mafia family members look down on him. Donnie comes as a gift from heaven and it does not take long before Lefty trusts Donnie completely. The problem for FBI-agent Donnie is that he's starting to like Lefty as well.",/review/rw8122351/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2007,bkoganbing,8," The Biggest Mutt In The History Of The Mafia
","With only one real scene of violence and mayhem in the film, Donnie Brasco relies far more on character development in a story of two men and the planned betrayal of one by another in the line of duty.",/review/rw8122351/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2005,paul2001sw-1,9," Gangster movie No. 1
","In a world filled with overheated, and frequently overpraised, gangster movies, it seems to me that Mike Newell's 'Donnie Brasco', the story of a cop who goes undercover to infiltrate the mob, is arguably overlooked. Based on real life events, it contains great performances from Johnny Depp and Al Pacino, a complex but coherent plot, addresses universal themes (divided loyalties, the evolution of human relationships and behaviour) and the ending is genuinely moving. Perhaps it's not fast-paced enough for devotees of the genre; more likely it ""fails"" this audience for its very success in portraying the mafia as fundamentally pathetic, whereas most gangster pictures at least partly buy into the glamorous myth. But for me, this a superior film to Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', with a faint note of very black comedy that sounds behind the slaughter. Recommended.",/review/rw8122351/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2000,The_Movie_Cat,8," ""Fergeddaboudid!""
","For a movie that's only three years old Donnie Brasco isn't something people talk about all that much. Not exactly setting the box office alight, it's further proof that great pictures don't always translate into great financial concerns. ",/review/rw8122351/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2004,mullermike,," Al Pacino's Best Movie
","Yes, I am going to make the bold claim that this is his best work. ""Are you talking about the same Al Pacino that did Scarface, Heat, AND the Godfather movies"" you ask. Yes, yes, and let me explain myself. First of all, I want to add that I LOVE Pacino's work. He has such a commanding presence on screen and nobody in cinematic history can scream as well as him (though Gene Hackman is damn good). He can scare the hell out of you with just one crazed look in his eye and he never gives a flat performance (well, except in Revolution).",/review/rw8122351/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2022,planktonrules,9," These aren't very nice folks!

28 October 2010,g-bodyl,9," Great, Underrated Mafia Film!
",I can't believe that I have never heard of Donnie Brasco. This is a great mafia film that I didn't expect much out of. I thought this would be a ripoff of the Godfather but it's not. I think it may be better than the Godfather.,/review/rw8122351/?ref_=tt_urv

11 March 2004,Ben_Cheshire,6," Superb mafia drama. Deeper, and rings truer than most.
","First rate mafia drama connects on a deeper level than most. Its cinematography may not have the moody, noirish atmosphere that makes The Godfather so appealing, but despite its slick Hollywood look, it seems to attain such penetrating truth (this, perhaps, has a little to do with its being based on a book by the real life main character). The central situation of the aging mafia man taking under his confidence and vouching for an undercover FBI agent, and that a bond forms between the two men is a great one. The performances are absolutely superb. Particularly the two men who the story centres on, Joe Pistone, a.k.a Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp, going for realism in this role, is incredible. It begins and ends with a closeup of his eyes - this movie would be nothing without him) and mafia man ""Lefty"" (Pacino, who gives us one of his finest characterisations - best bit, his close-up after Donnie is asked to shake hands by a certain character on a certain boat). The vividness of the characters in this movie seems to owe a great deal to the superb screenplay (again, credit to the real-life source material). Recurring catch-phrases make it easy for us to get to know characters, and wonderful little touches give the story such a resonance, and make it ring true: like Lefty's smoking inside the car when driving with Brasco and accusing Brasco of trying to kill him with the draft when he opens a window to let some smoke out, and the portrait of Lefty, the opposite of how we imagine a mafia veteran, as a vulnerable, often emotional man.",/review/rw8122351/?ref_=tt_urv

13 November 1998,Snrub,10," A deeply moving and beautiful movie.
","I read movie magazines regulary and I came across a review for ""Donnie Brasco"". I read it and thought ""I would like to see that"". It isn't really a well known film and I didn't remember it coming out in the cinema. So there I saw it, in my local video rental store, near the bottom shelf and just one copy. I rented it and I watched it. And I have to say it is one of the finest movies I had ever seen. It has drama, comedy, sadness and violence and continues to entertain the viewer until the opening of the end credits.",/review/rw8122351/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2012,ma-cortes,8," Over-the-top gangster movie perfectly interpreted by two superstars and masterfully realized
","Interesting and thought-provoking flick film that had a great importance of wide range on subsequent films and TV series as the ¨Sopranos¨ . Powerful portrait of an undercover agent along with the rise and fall of a gangster extraordinarily performed by Johnny Depp and Al Pacino respectively . This is one of the greatest mobster movies and a high watchable story ; being an expertly directed film by Mike Newell and made Johnny Depp a superstar . An FBI undercover agent named Pistone infiltrates the mob and finds himself identifying more with the mafia life to the expense of his regular one . Using the name Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp) , he befriends a 'made' mafioso Benjamin 'Lefty' Ruggiero (it is an amalgam of the real ""Lefty"" played by Al Pacino and the real ""Sonny Black"" Napolitano performed by Michael Madsen) . Brasco becomes tight as the group goes about collecting cash for 'the bosses' . A deep dilemma is afforded to Donnie, who knows if he walks away from the mobster family , Lefty will be the one killed . Brasco is married and has three children but he is away for months at a time eventually leading to his wife (Anna Heche) asking for a divorce . The mission forces him to virtually leave his family , living among the ¨wise guys¨ , as he turns more and more part of the Mob group. ",/review/rw8122351/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2016,Leofwine_draca,7," Unusual gangster story works very well
","At once a worthy and intelligent gangster tale, with less emphasis on extreme violence and melodrama than previous offerings in the genre. This is a character-led drama which draws excellent performances from both Johnny Depp and Al Pacino as the cop and seasoned criminal who become unlikely pals during the course of the film. The supporting players are also good - particularly Michael Madsen, on hand to play yet another sociopath - but it's Depp and Pacino who the film belongs to. Depp gives an ambitious, multi-layered performance of a cop torn between his duties and his loyalty for his new friend, while Pacino is surprisingly restrained and different to his normal persona.",/review/rw8122351/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2017,classicsoncall,8," ""Even a dog gets a warm piece of the sidewalk.""
","It's been a long time since I read Joseph Pistone's story in the book ""Donnie Brasco"", but I can still recall three essential elements that kept recurring throughout his story. They had to do with the principal fears Pistone had while working undercover for the FBI. The first obviously was being found out, which would have meant curtains for him. That would have immediately brought recrimination by the Mob against his sponsor Lefty for bringing him into the Family. And there was one other element that didn't get singled out specifically in this film, Pistone's qualms about what he would do if he was actually ordered to perform a hit on someone. I remember his wrestling over the idea that if the hit was ordered on another mobster whether he would do it or not, since they were all bad guys and the victim would have deserved it in line with the Mafia code of honor. As it is, I don't think he was ever asked to perform one.",/review/rw8122351/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2020,Tweekums,9," An impressive mob movie
","This film is centred on undercover FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone. Posing as a jewel thief named Donnie Brascoe he gains the confidence of Lefty Ruggiero, a hitman working for one of the New York Mafia families. The two gradually become friends and Lefty explains the ways of the mob to him; it isn't long before Pistone is associating with more senior members of the family. As this is going on Lefty starts to feel bitter as his loyalty to the family goes unrewarded and others are promoted ahead of him. The undercover work threatens Pistone's marriage and his superiors fear that he is becoming his assumed persona.",/review/rw8122351/?ref_=tt_urv

2 May 2000,robsellke,," Interesting true-life story of undercover Mafia agent
","This movie was just plain good.  The plot was interesting and fast-paced, the characters were in-depth and realistic, the acting was good, and the action was great.  It is a sad movie, however.  No matter how you look at it, these things actually happened. Those men really did die.  The true story that ""Donnie Brasco"" is based on makes the movie have more depth, and obviously, more reality.  This movie also does a very good job of portraying the 70's, the time period in which the actual events took place.  It is an exciting, dangerous, and wild movie, but very down-beat.  Once you're in the mob, it's very hard to get out.",/review/rw8122351/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2012,Uriah43,5," A Passable Movie
","With a cast that included Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen and Anne Heche I honestly expected something slightly better than this. Make no mistake, it isn't a bad picture by any means. But in some places it seemed rather dark and slow-moving. Even so, Al Pacino was excellent as the hit man ""Lefty Ruggiero"". Johnny Depp (as the undercover FBI agent ""Donnie Brasco/Joe Pistone"") and Michael Madsen (""Sonny Black"") also turned in fine performances as well. And while Anne Heche (""Maggie Pistone"") was definitely cute, I thought the movie could have used a bit more fine-tuning in the relationship between her and Johnny Depp. Perhaps if they had shown some happier moments between the two prior to him taking the undercover assignment it would have added some depth to her character. As it was, all we get to see is a strained relationship from the very start. Likewise, it seems the film ends a little too soon and it could have been drawn out a bit more. All things considered, this was a passable movie and fans of Al Pacino or Johnny Depp probably won't be too disappointed.",/review/rw8122351/?ref_=tt_urv

1 July 2004,=G=,7," Not bad, not great.
","""Donnie Brasco"" tells of an FBI agent (Depp) who infiltrates a NYC mob crew where his allegiance is tested by his growing affection for his aging wiseguy mentor (Pacino) to the dismay of his wife (Heche). The film is chock full of stereotypes with the same old character actor faces we've seen playing mob types before and lacks the grit or edge one would expect of a crime flick based on a true story. The film's matter-of-fact approach to life in the mob keeps emotions in tow with little stretching required of the players and provides a sort of ""business as usual"" backdrop for the real crux of the story, the waxing relationship between Depp and Pacino and the waning relationship between Depp and Heche. The result is moderately captivating 2 hour film with respectable marks from critics and public which should make a worthwhile small screen diversion for crime buffs.

7 May 2022,Mcnabbbeasty,9," Top tier mobster cinema? Fuhhget about it.
","Donnie Brasco, maybe the most under appreciated gangster film ever made. Pacino and Depp were an absolute powerhouse duo in this riveting soul filled 2 hours of clever cinematic mobster brilliance. Pacino was obviously great in The Godfather triology but my taste gravitates to this and Carlito's Way as my favorite gangster performances from the all time legend. Don't let this one fly over your head. One of my all time favorites, fuhhget about it.",/review/rw8122351/?ref_=tt_urv
