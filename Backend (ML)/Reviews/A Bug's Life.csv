27 May 2014,gogoschka-1,9," Clever, intense Sci-Fi spectacle; offers nearly as much humor as it does excitement along with a great, unexpected turn from Tom Cruise
","Wow - this was unexpected. The trailers had me believe that after 'Battle L.A.' and 'Oblivion' this would be yet another bleak, action- packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about an alien invasion - what the trailers failed to convey almost entirely is that over long stretches, this is also seasoned with nearly as much humor as 'Groundhog Day'. That it would invite comparisons with the Harold Ramis/ Bill Murray classic was obvious, given the time loop premise, but I never expected to what extent those comparisons would actually be justified and that this film would really tap into a similar kind of comedy. Luckily, it is all the better for it.",/review/rw7086141/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2015,SnoopyStyle,9," great sci-fi
","An alien race has invaded the Earth starting in Europe. After 5 years of relentless defeats where the Mimics seem to anticipate every move, the United Defense Force finally has a victory with the invention of a new jacket technology. Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) is hailed as an example of the new success. William Cage (Tom Cruise) is a military media officer. General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) is sending him on the first wave to cover the expected victory. He is arrested and forced to fight under Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton). He manages to kill a large Mimic. He is sprayed with its blood and dies. He wakes up the previous morning as a prisoner about to go into battle.",/review/rw7086141/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2021,pawanpunjabithewriter,9," Wht do you want? A good movie? A spectacular movie? An Exceptional movie? You're reading the review of one
","I was enjoying my Sunday evening watching the World Test Championship Final against India and New Zealand until the dark clouds hovered at the sky in Southampton and stopped the play. I switched to Netflix, searched for a movie and played one, however, eventually I was going to go back watching Cricket once it started. Guess what? I never did until I ended. Cricket runs through my blood. My two most favourite teams were at the cricket ground facing each other for the ultimate battle of the World Championship with millions of people supporting both. I was so mesmerized in the movie, I hardly checked out the score. Edge of Tomorrow took me to such an edge of my seat for long I farted almost a hundred times unknowingly. (It's quite a deal-breaker if you're planning to watch a movie with me.) I was profoundly engaged in it for what's going to come. Even good movies have several dull moments, I could hardly figure out one in this movie. Although the first few minutes got me thinking why are they trying to mix The US Army with The UK. This movie has almost everything in it. A package full of entertainment including Action, Sci-fi, adventure and a little bit of comedy whenever they got a chance to add some. The actors were amazing. Tom Cruise and Emily Brunt were so good can't expect better. The others didn't really have much to do with all the limelight shared between the two of them, however, at the end all came out remarkable. Special effects could have been better largely, considering it was a high-budget movie. Also, one thing which could be elaborated more was about the antagonist. I feel their side should have been shown a little.",/review/rw7086141/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2014,jan_kalina,10," ""You see this isn't the first time that we've had this conversation. ""
","Why do we go to the movies? To be entertained, to laugh, to be amused, to be pulled into situations that are far from ever happening to us. The only certainty in today's film world that the film that you pick to watch in cinema is Tom Cruise. If you go into cinema and see any of Cruise's films you can be damn sure that that film won't disappoint you. Tom Cruise sure picks great projects. Frankly, I have to say that I haven't seen a bad film starring Tom Cruise.",/review/rw7086141/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2014,CalRhys,," A Summer Blockbuster Not To Be Missed
","One of the most ingenious film concepts ever created, a cross between 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Groundhog Day', 'Edge of Tomorrow' is a gripping and clever blockbuster sci-fi thrill-ride accompanied with taut, fast-paced action and compelling direction. Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt form a perfect chemistry that takes them from the training ground, to the battlefield through to the action-bound finale in Paris. The premise of the time-loop has been used many times before, but this time round there are enough exciting visuals and dynamic storytelling skills employed to make this one thrilling (and unexpectedly comedic) flick that is unpredictable and expertly designed. A model of cinematic craftsmanship.",/review/rw7086141/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2014,InternetOfZings,10," Witty and thrilling summer blockbuster with Tom Cruise in top form
","You could describe this movie as a dizzying combination of Groundhog Day, Starship Troopers, Source Code and The Butterfly Effect. Edge of Tomorrow borrows from these films and while some of the individual ideas may not therefore be groundbreakingly original, the way they're combined and put to use in Edge of Tomorrow by director Doug Liman certainly is. As aliens have invaded Earth, humanity's only hope lies in a cowardly PR officer Bill Cage (played by Tom Cruise) with no combat skills who is sent to the front lines. His only advantage? A save point, sort of. Are you excited yet? You should be. I don't want to tell you more specifics about the plot because it's best to experience and discover this great piece of work yourself.

10 July 2016,somersetboy,10," What a Fantastic Movie!
","Superb! I rarely get to go to a movie with my older son after his siblings came along. We did manage to go to this movie in the cinemas. Not only were we glad we chose this movie to watch, but two years later, we still recall the impact this movie had on both of us. ",/review/rw7086141/?ref_=tt_urv

28 May 2014,aldri-feb,8," This year's most surprising blockbuster movie so far
","With thrilling action sequences, clever sense of humor and surprisingly intellectual storyline, ""Edge of Tomorrow"" shows a real deal of summer blockbuster movie and proves itself beyond expectation especially after unconvincing trailers. Perhaps the theme and alien character looks familiar with some popular sci-fi movies but it's still combined perfectly as an entertainment. Doug Liman as director smartly exploited 're-setting the day' aspect without making it complicated and escaping it from being dull with some quality combat moments also inserting lovable drama that is commanded by memorable chemistry from Tom Cruise and Emilly Blunt have carried whole scenes in it. Overall ""Edge of Tomorrow"" feels more satisfying than it might have been in any ways and shows how the non-sequel-reboot blockbuster movie should be done. It's definitely much fun than I have ever imagined and pleasurable to re-watch it over and over again.",/review/rw7086141/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2014,jigsaw-91,9," Tom Cruise meets his Groundhog Day with a surprising, well told story and energetic entertainment
","Edge of Tomorrow (EOT for me) will be the most surprising blockbuster of this year (maybe along with X-Men: Days of Future Past) for doing its job so well that beats every expectation about what it has to offer. A storyline about one man that is shown to us doing the ""same"" things every time could be dull. But EOT has a thoughtful script full of turns and fun that entertains and allows to Cruise to do new things inside that particular Groundhog Day.",/review/rw7086141/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2015,chaos-rampant,," Boddhisatva
","This is that rare thing, a blockbuster that does more than just deafen with noise of its machinery. More on this in a bit. But I'm also amazed at how well it deploys that machinery, I want to quickly note this deployment that shows we are at the hands of excellent practitioners.",/review/rw7086141/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2019,Sleepin_Dragon,8," Impressive blockbuster
","My expectations weren't high, the reality was quite surprising, this movie was if course action packed, was of course well acted, but much more then that it was an intelligent movie. I had expected a good old fashioned shooter em up movie, I didn't expect a movie that dealt with such clever themes, including recursion and continued death.",/review/rw7086141/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2014,andynaik,8," The definite blockbuster of this summer
","Another sci-fi movie starring Tom Cruise didn't interest me much. The trailer also didn't give me a clear idea of what this movie was about which made it even surprisingly good to experience it! The thing about movies like these is that there's a lot of potential to repeat the same things over and over and leave the viewer uninterested. However, every time there was something new so it didn't feel repetitive. There were also elements of humor that were refreshing. The editing should be admired.",/review/rw7086141/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2015,Hitchcoc,9," Right On Military Sci Fi
","Tom Cruise plays an ad man army Major who, through the whim of a commander, finds himself heading into combat against an alien force of spider-like creatures that have the ability to restructure time. Cruise is killed numerous times by these things and always come back to the same place. He learns more about the mission and the creatures each time he goes back. In the process, he meets a female war hero played by Emily Blunt who has the same time warping thing going on. The proceed to relive the same times over and over. She, unfortunately, has no recollection of what was done. This is powerful, intelligent science fiction with a knock dead premise. Yes, ""Wake up, Maggot"" is this movie's ""I Got You, Babe,"" from ""Groundhog Day."" And the idea of reliving our day over and over isn't brand new, but the battle scenes are awesome and the aliens powerful and disgusting. There is a wonderful bond that develops between Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. It isn't the maudlin empty headed stuff like we saw in ""Independence Day"" many years ago. We really get to care about the people. This movie really surprised me.",/review/rw7086141/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2014,nick-sultana,10," Better than I was expecting....

2 February 2021,aidanratesmovies,10," Brilliant Film, one of my personal favorites
","It's hard to compromise how a film of such similar plot development to Groundhog Day can be considered to be such a great action movie, but like the events in this film, you just have to see it to believe it. Edge of Tomorrow is honestly my favorite Tom Cruise movie, and when you have such a great track record like Cruise, that's really saying something. The film is phenomenal, as with Groundhog Day it follows a similar plot, but it certainly has a different way at going at the themes it develops. Cruise and Blunt make a terrific pair in this action/sci-fi/thriller and the film is nothing short of brilliant. The special effects are mesmerizing, the look of the film daunting, and yet nostalgic and fully realized. I love the development of the world we find our characters in, and all the aliens it involves. I love nearly every aspect of this film, and although on the surface it may not seem original, it certainly feels that way. In the end, Edge of Tomorrow is a must see action flick that will have audiences on the edge of their seats, and is a must see for any Sci-=fi or Cruise fan in general.

28 May 2014,kshirad,9," Why bother on originality when the execution is so well-handed?
","There are multiple plot strands from other films gathered into a union. I won't give you any hint but you'll get it when you see it. Nowadays, movies are short on originality. But, in this case, you won't give a thing about it. ",/review/rw7086141/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2014,knyffeler,10," BETTER than I was expecting!
","I saw the trailer of this, but was expecting another campy ""Independence Day"" trying to be too funny, ""War of the Worlds"" that tried to be too serious or ""District 9"" that was FX for FX sake. I probably would have not gone, but my date said her daughter saw it and loved it.",/review/rw7086141/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2019,hazzaboombatty,10," Terrific presentation, I mean, really terrific!
","This is a great film, quite underrated. It's actually a classic in my view, the action is really well done but it's funny and the characters have some depth, so it's got that same X factor that die hard and other action classics have. Watch it many times. You won't regret it. Now... time for some PT.",/review/rw7086141/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2018,nogodnomasters,8," A COWARD DIES A THOUSAND DEATHS
","The opening of the film is quick and disjointed. What we gather is that an alien has crashed on earth in a meteor and is taking over the planet. A D-Day type affront is planned and General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) is assigning desk jockey Major Cage (Tom Cruise) to lead the charge. At this point we find out Cage is a coward and gets demoted to a private, placed in the front lines.",/review/rw7086141/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2018,mikemx321,10," The people calling this movie ""intelligent"" are correct
","Read the negative reviews, the people calling this movie stupid etc. etc. obviously weren't able to fully understand what they were seeing. This is the risk filmmakers take when they don't assume the audience is going to have the mentality of a 10-year-old, but thankfully most of us don't need every little aspect explained in full.

13 June 2020,toofancorp,10," Love this movie
","Re-watched it again for the first time in years and it is still amazing. If you are into sci-fi, video games, action, adventure, etc this is a MUST watch film. Emily and Tom really came at this with their A GAME, and really when you think about how absurd/nerdy the concept can be it's much appreciated. The dialogue was also really well written and the editing top notch. I think about the multitude of ways you can really screw this up and they didn't is so impressive. I am shocked the director has not done a follow up or sci fi film since.",/review/rw7086141/?ref_=tt_urv
