23 January 2012,bob the moo,," Accessible, huge, addictive, attractive and great value for money in terms of £ per hour!
","""I'm not really into all that wizards and dwarfs nonsense"" I told a friend when he talked about the new Elder Scrolls game, a series I had no interest in and even less knowledge of. The connection to the Fallout games though meant that I knew the basic gameplay would appeal to me since I like the idea of RPG but not the incredibly detailed stats packages that most come with – selecting equipment, taking notes and digging in menus I'm fine with, but too much detail I'm not. As a result I picked this game up, still not totally sure that I would like the loss of guns and dark comedy that I got with Fallout 3 and NV.",/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2021,utku_kamil_ozen,10," ...a kind freedom that you cannot possibly experience in real life...
","Long have I wanted to write a review for this game, but it's such a great game and it deserves such an in-depth review that I've been avoiding the task. Finally, I decided to write a review in two different aspects of the game; first what it represents as a video game and secondly its gameplay.",/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2012,jayjaymadigan,9," The best game of the 21st century?
","This game, really is one of the best games you'll ever play, a massive open end world, hundreds of quests, complete character customization, amazing story lines, you'll have trouble putting your pad down, I genuinely get excited every time I play this game, because of how massive the world is, every play through brings new adventures, new characters, new places, new stories and new rewards, you could play this game for months and find new things you previously never knew about, the graphics are out standing, immense game play, challenging boss fights, amusing dialogue, and a beautiful soundtrack really makes Skyrim stand out from all the rest, all I can really say is, if you're and RPG fan, and a fan of sandbox games, and want a game that's actually worth the price tag stuck to it, buy this you will not be disappointed! If i had to summarize it in a few words I would simply say, you need this game in your life!",/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2012,neverteller33,10," Does this game ever end?
","And I'm not talking about the quests, but the atmosphere, the feeling it gives, the sheer joy of being there. Skyrim takes what is great from both Morrowind and Oblivion, improving on it tremendously, becoming in itself a huge epic. Nevermind the bugs, the glitches. It is simply breathtaking. I must admit, I am what one would call a hardcore fan of the series, and very pretentious about my fantasies... This is a game in which the hero is a Hero in everything he does. As a player, you will never stop fulfilling prophecies. It is rewarding every step of the way, like no game before it. I have been playing Skyrim since November, finished it in December. Fan or not... I ask you... Why can't I stop (July the following year)? I have my own supposition. Maybe it's because this game never ceases to amaze me. It never ends. Just like the world.",/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2019,samball-28104,10," the greatest game ever made
",This game changed my life. I have probably played through it at least 15 times. I got this for my 8th birthday when it came out expecting nothing from it and here I am in 2019 after platinuming it twice on two different accounts and no game has yet topped it. I recommend this to anyone who is even alive,/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2014,petra_ste,8," I used to distrust Bethesda, but then I took a Skyrim to the knee
","I wasn't a fan of Bethesda before Skyrim - their ""quantity over quality, freedom over narrative"" philosophy rubbed me the wrong way. Still, this sandbox RPG is a colossal achievement.",/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2019,jebyvyson,10," Best Fantasy Game In Video Game History.
","I wasn't really into magical, mystic, fantasy that much. I been wanting to try Skyrim ever since it became a meme and now 7 or 8 years later, I finally got my hands on it. I heard from people it's the best video game in history, it's overrated, too many bugs, it makes the game more fun. I decided to get into it for myself.",/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2011,thegreatcory,10," A must try game, for any person
","It's been the better part of a year since they first announced that 'Skyrim', the sequel to The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, was in production. I was pretty darned hyped, because I absolutely loved Oblivion and thought it was a great game, despite some problems it had.",/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2011,doesitactuallymatter,8," A tricky one.
",The Elder Scrolls franchise has been a staple for the RPG genre for quite some time now. Skyrim builds on top of what made the previous titles great while reworking some core features.,/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2021,Analog_Devotee,10," 10/10!
","While I'm not a fan of how much Bethesda has milked this game over the years, there's no denying its impact on the action RPG genre and gaming as a whole. I mean, this is everything every fantasy fan dreamed of for decades and never thought possible. If you enjoy fantasy action RPGs and somehow haven't played this game, I'm not exactly sure what you're waiting for. This is the be-all and end-all, the best that's ever been done. Jump on the ship already.",/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2012,tp-evans,10," This is My favourite game ever and i LOVE the elder scrolls series
",Skyrim has got to be the best game ever it has everything you could ever want in an Rpg it has OUTSTANDING! Graphics and is practically limitless and endless from fighting dragons to bar brawls this game has everything with a incredible amount of customisation you can do anything and go anywhere in its massive area comparing this to call of duty would be like Pluto to the sun with skyrim obviously being the sun skyrim is the masterpiece of the a new generation of games and will stay at the top for a very long time The great and famous game developers at Bethesda have delivered a masterpiece and I'm certain they will do it again and again I'm very pleased with this amazing game i take my hat off to you Bethesda you have done it once again.,/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2013,mallen92506,10," An epic fantasy within an epic game!
","Normally I do a Good, Bad and Verdict on my written reviews but in the case of this game, aside from a few minor bugs and nitpicks, I can't think of any complaints about this game. This is pretty much my perfect game!",/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2022,cameronbettoncom,10," One of the Greatest Games of All Time
","Best game of 2011 hands down, and arguably the greatest game of all time. Now it probably isn't my favorite and really is tied with Fallout New Vegas, Red Dead Redemption 2, Halo Reach and Call of Duty Black Ops 2 in my opinion. They're all my favorite games I've ever played really. In Skyrim there's so much to explore and see, not to mention quests and dungeons, collecting items, crafting items, the grind in the game is satisfying and the perk and levels system is pretty much perfect. The main quest is fun and due to the amount of things to do in the game which I've still yet to 100% complete the game, but as a result this is why I'm on only my second playthrough. Always picking imperial as my go to characters. Next time though I'll probably due a Khajiit or something. Not to mention most versions of the game people have now allow mod support so just get mods to make the game more immersive, realistic and fun. Which most of the mods in Skyrim are there to improve the feeling of the game and fix bugs and such. This game not to mention is one of the first major games I've played in my life making the nostalgia strong, probably making me a little biased. But please hear me out. If you're fine with medieval/fantasy genres, and you love open world RPGs you will indeed play this game religiously. Now I don't really use the DLCs much cause since I just got Special Edition with DLC I've yet to try them, but from what I've seen and heard I'm sure they're great as well. I've used Hearthfire and it's not much to offer but what it does bring to the table is cool. I love building a house to my own liking. I just wished we could build in more locations. Must buy game.",/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2015,nemod12,9," Could be epic if it wasn't for the bugs.
","I picked this game up a bit later than the most people. i didn't played Oblivion and i was very new to the series. I played Fallot 3 later than Skyrim , and i am going to come back on than in a minute, ",/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2022,gianmarcoronconi,10," Massive
","Massive video game that offers hours and hours of wonderful fun, when you play it it seems that time does not pass because this game manages to capture you and fully immerse you in the narrative universe of the Dragonborn.",/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2020,andersondavidthomas,10," Endless stories to be told
","While there is a main quest, Skyrim is unique in the fashion that you create your character and choose how they live their life. You create your own narrative, backstory, morals, and skills. Once you play through the game once you can play through many times and yet, you will never have the same story told twice unless you choose it to be. Want to play as a ex convict that found their way in life, fell in love, started a family and got a job fighting dragons? Or would you rather play as a mercenary just in it for the money and loot? Or maybe somewhere in between?
Skyrim is a breakthrough in gaming. While there are glitches, they add to the the enjoyment of the game and will make you laugh.
If you have it on PC I recommend getting some of the goofy mods to have more fun.
This game is a must play.",/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2020,xxbldyxtrzxx-77111,10," Years of playing this game, watching others, it NEVER gets old!
","I originally started skyrim when it came out 7-8 years ago. Since then, I've bought it 5 different times, from switching consoles, played through it differently each time. Whether it was a nord,or any of the other races and 2 handed, 1 handed 1 magic, mage, all of it. It is still my favorite game I've ever played. Im 30. Grew up with nes,snes,sega, e.t.c. I plan on getting the imperial dragon as a tattoo because of how much this game means to me. I know it sounds silly, but this game has saved my life. Ive been through alot. I found my brother after he committed suicide, have lost alot of friends from suicide and overdose, seen family go in and out of hospitals. This game has always been an escape of mine. ALOT of my friends play it as well, so its not only therapeutic to play, but to watch. I've watched game play on YouTube to see others play as well. Needless to say, one of the best games ever made. Completely immersive. You are doing yourself a dishonor by not playing this. If you're a fan of open world rpg's, PLAY THIS GAME!!!!!",/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2019,austinriggs-84643,10," Favorite game I've played. Ever.
","I mean, how did they do this? I'm playing though for the 6th time now and with all of the mods there are it's interesting every time. I own about 300 video games and the only one I MIGHT like more is San Andreas. Only complaint I have is that because there are so many character combinations, your character doesn't have a voice. If you are looking for hours of fun-I've probably put 2000+ in-look no further.",/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2019,AtypicalAdventurer,2," Brilliant idea, terrible execution (PS3/PS4/PS5)
","I've never given a review this low for anything, but after having lost literally dozens of hours trying to mod, patch, fix, restart, and reinstall this game just to try to get it to function... I'm done with it. Playing a game should not feel like bailing out a sinking ship just to keep it afloat.",/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2021,thekingcobramma,10," My favorite game ever
","I swear I most have replayed the story on this game at least 20 times. This game is a true masterpiece, from the story to open world this game is definitely one of the best games ever made. One of the main things I love about this game is that there is so much to explore, it's a huge open world game with so many things to find and so many collectables to collect. Bethesda really knew what they were doing when they were making this game, the graphics and scenery in this game are brilliant especially in the remastered version. The DLC were also good, one of them being a new location were the player can explore and do more missions. I would highly recommend people to try this game out, it's just a true masterpiece and one of the GOATS.",/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2022,thomasgouldsbrough,9," ""Fus Ro Dah!""
","Skyrim is simply a work of art. The world is so incredibly rich and vast, and the game has all sorts to offer. Epic quests, beautiful scenery, and awesome abilities. It's very possible with all that Skyrim has to offer to invest 1000+ into the game, and still find something new with each playthrough.",/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2019,PersianCinephile,10," Best Open World RPG I have played.
","Well-written story for both Main and Side-Quests.
Amazing sound track that turn this game to an unforgettable epic.
Easy UI, relatively simple
Awesomely active community with a lot of mods and extra content you could use.
The game is a must-play.",/review/rw4695260/?ref_=tt_urv
