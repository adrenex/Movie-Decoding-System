30 May 2010,3xHCCH,8," Very Entertaining Summer Blockbuster Film!
","I was looking forward to this film because of the hype, and I was afraid to be disappointed. But as the film unfolded, I most definitely enjoyed this adventure from beginning to end.",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2010,OrinAGN,7," The sands have spread fairly thin and it shows... but surprisingly in a good way
","The common view amongst ""professional"" reviews is that the movie is average. scoring below 50% from Rotten Tomatoes, and MetaCritic, and notably a 2 out of 4 stars from Roger Ebert. The average user ranking on MC puts it at 9 out of 10.",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've never played the Prince of Persia games, but this movie wants me to try one of the games. The movie is very good and the visuals are stunning.",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2010,thefilmgourmet,8," It was entertaining and fun
","First of all when I read some of the reviews about this movie all my excitement was drained but I went to see it anyway. What do you now, the movie was great. It was fun, had a lot of action in it, the CGI was nice (excecpt few scenes in the beginning). I thought acting was nice Gyllenhaal (prince) and Arterton (Princess) did a good job in my opinion. As a fun of the game; the script wasn't entirely accurate just like most of the movies based on games but it didn't stray too far either. OK it was not the perfect movie but it was something that I would go and watch its sequel.",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2010,miriam-rios,9," It is refreshing!
","Did you see Iron Man and Robin Hood? Yes? Well, this film is better, simply because the story is original. I know, I know, it is based on the computer game...which I used to play ages ago...but the story portrayed in the script is classic and refreshing at the same time; the performances are natural and the stunt scenes are unbelievable. Now, what did Iron Man 2 miss and this movie excels at? Plot, and a fast action pace without being over caffeinated big bang explosions (ever saw G.I. Joe?)",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2010,Generic_Gooner,7," Proof a video game cross over CAN work...
","We all know the score. Movie based on a video game, it's going to be poor, right? Well actually Bruckheimer, Newell and Disney beg to differ, and I have to agree with them on this one.",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2010,claudio_carvalho,9," A Delightful Adventure
","In Persia, in the Royal City of Nasaf, the fair King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup) rules the empire with his brother Nizan (Ben Kingsley). Sharaman has two sons, but adopts the orphan Dastan that becomes part of his family. Years later, the Holy City of Alamut ruled by Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) is under siege of the troops led by Tus (Richard Coyle), Garsiv (Toby Kebbell) and Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal), after their uncle Nizan had intercepted a spy carrying weapons manufactured in Alamut. Dastan invades the city with his men to avoid a massacre and the Persian army conquers the city. Dastan gets a dagger from an enemy and King Sharaman comes to Almut very upset with the invasion of the holy city. Then he arranges the marriage of Dastan with Princess Tamina. When Dastan gives a holy cloak delivered by Tus to his father, the mantle is poisoned and kills Sharaman. Dastan is accused of betrayal but he escapes with Princess Ttamina. Sooner he finds that the dagger is a powerful device to travel and change time and that Tus is not the traitor and he engages with Tamina in a quest for justice. ",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2010,dvc5159,5," Entertaining summer romp
","Movies are like food. There are some which are bitter and hard to swallow yet nutritious in every aspect, and those which are tasty albeit fattening. ""Prince Of Persia"" falls in the latter category, it's fun to watch and enjoyable, and where intelligence doesn't really matter.",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Prince of persia
","Having never played the game I didn't know much about what the plot was about but the games were big hits and popular enough to make a live action movie so I eventually gave it a watch and was very surprised, The story is very loyal to the games from what I seen in the games, Some nice action scenes and good effects, I didn't like the choice of actors but they did ok, As far as game to movies go it's probably one of the better ones, Even if it won't stand the test of time (No pun intended) I think maybe it could of been better if it wasn't made by Disney as they like to tone films down so much that if you're over the age of 11 it's not as enjoyable, But it could of been much worse so I can't complain too much, A good family film that is easy to watch even if you haven't played any of the games.",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2010,bkoganbing,7," Souped Up Sabu
","There was a time back in the day when Hollywood turned out dozens of films like Prince Of Persia. Universal Studios was the chief maker of these ancient Middle East fantasies. Maria Montez had a set built for her films and when she died it was used lots of times by stars like Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis in their early days. And of course the boy from India, Sabu kept his career going on films like Prince Of Persia.",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2010,bucaneerfilms,9," Not Your Average Video Game Flick
","Tonight I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening of this film. Like many, I became a fan of this franchise with the Sands of Time trilogy, and I was very excited when I learned that there were plans to make a feature film based on it. The storyline of the game is very cinematic (at least in the aforementioned trilogy, not necessarily in the previous games in the series) so I felt that at film adaptation would be an impressive epic.",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv

2 June 2010,EUyeshima,5," Bruckheimer and CGI Effects Dominate a Paper-Thin, Fleet-Footed Video Game-Derived Epic
","The sight of Jake Gyllenhaal in a defiantly heroic pose with his imposing dagger on the poster of this 2010 fantasy adventure would seem to portend a film filled with self-parody, but alas, the actor takes the Aladdin-like title role semi-seriously. He's actually better than expected in the over-the-top derring-do role, but the movie itself is absurdly convoluted and overly ridiculous, even by the standards of the 2003 video game which inspired this CGI-saturated production. It should come as no surprise that the executive producer is action-schlock master Jerry Bruckheimer, whose commercial track record extends from ""Beverly Hills Cop"" to the ""National Treasure"" franchise. What did surprise me is that the director is Mike Newell, better known for soft, female-oriented fare such as ""Enchanted April"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". However, both he and Gyllenhaal give themselves almost entirely to Bruckheimer's more commercial, comic-book sensibilities.",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2010,ajs-10,7," A great adventure...
","As a player of the original video game, back when computers were clunky and slow, I was quite interested to see how the Prince has evolved. I wasn't disappointed; a lot of the moves and mythology from the original game survives in this film. Obviously the graphics are much better, and the film isn't too bad either.",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2010,interrealm,8," The video game series sets the precident for the movie
","It isn't often that a video game is so vivid, so involving...so enveloping, that it is looked on as a possible movie franchise on all those merits. Usually, just the action (Doom, Final Fantasy), or just the body (Lara Croft...Tomb Raider) or just some other one aspect makes for a great game, but an underwhelming movie. I had the pleasure of watching this movie in an early screening on Monday night, and it is definitely a step above and beyond the aforementioned videogames-turned-movies.",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2010,CihanVercan,7," When a very best combat/platform game turns age 21, now it became a Swashbuckler film
","Prince of Persia is the BEST PLATFORM GAME on computer I ever played as a child. It's not that industrial standard movies can create new ideas, they have to find a source to make an adaptation, but Sands of Time doesn't stand enough loyal to its title. What not staying loyal to Prince of Persia means, there is not any visually admirable combat with the film at all. When it's been first released, AUTUMN 1989, in Apple II; there were only a palace, a peasant child, a princess under the Caliph's servitude and hundreds of guardians defending the palace. Our peasant child as a spy was there to rescue the princess to bring her back to father the Persian Emperor. Looking at the continuation of the game series, the story is taken back in time about 15 centuries back to Persian realm before the birth of Christ. When I played the 2003 Sands of Time game on X-Box, the combat sense of the game had been gone. It was rather boring and bothersome since our peasant has become a prince, with not much to do other than jumping back and forth over the house roofs like Spider-Man.",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2010,quinnox-1,7," Better than expected
","My friend dragged me to this movie, I am usually picky and wouldn't have seen this on my own but there I was in the theater on my friends insistence watching Prince of Persia. Surprisingly it was pretty good for a summer movie meant to entertain. I was never a fan of the main actor in this movie, but he was good in the role as the Prince of Persia who was not royal born.",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2010,monkeymajik153,9," Underrated
","I didn't expect much from this movie, and wasn't planning on watching it after watching the trailer, which had somehow managed to butcher the action sequences which turned to be pretty good in the movie. It hardly depicted the movie for what it made out to be, so i'm more than glad that i did. At first glance Jake wouldn't be my first choice for the role of the prince as i didn't think he really looked the part, with his slightly goofy looking demeanor, but he made up for it as he certainly played the part(and thanks to the costume designer, dressed the part), coupled with a good body double the parkour wasn't far off either. There was good chemistry between the male and female leads, however, granted perhaps overplayed in less than idyllic moments for pda haha, which some might find cliché but hardly something to dwell on in this pretty awesome movie so its not as bad as other critics claim. It offers aesthetically pleasing graphics (as to be expected of the people who worked on the pirates of the Caribbean) and although deviated from the plot of the game, the important aspects blended well and made for an enjoyable, and not totally predictable storyline. Another epic jerry epic i say. I sincerely hope they make a sequel, especially if the the dark prince is involved in the storyline, that would be badass (magma cracks already showing on the prince's body during slow mo time travel scenes so fingers crossed)",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2010,MaxBorg89,7," Bruckheimer does it again
","One thing has to be said about Jerry Bruckheimer: he isn't afraid of anything. Despite the frequent criticism he receives for having launched the dodgy careers of Tony Scott and Michael Bay (ironically with both achieving their finest work to date without his tutelage), he's also responsible for crowd-pleasing franchises like Beverly Hills Cop and Pirates of the Caribbean. Even by his standards, though, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time was a bit of a risk. Sure, he secured a competent director (Mike Newell, who helmed the best Harry Potter film to date) and a reliable cast (Jake Gyllenhaal, Ben Kingsley, Alfred Molina), but the project still came with that one unpleasant characteristic: based on a video game. Then again, everyone said he was crazy when he wanted to make a movie out of a theme park ride, so maybe he had the right tools to get the game-to-film transition right for once. Based on the finished product, it looks like the gamble mostly paid off.",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv

2 May 2011,TheLittleSongbird,7," Entertaining film
","This film I see has had a mixed reception. I am inclined to think that while it is flawed it was an entertaining and above average film. As I've said, it is flawed, the film is rushed sometimes, I personally would have liked more room to breathe, the script does have its weaknesses, some of it could have been more witty and less wordy and banal though there are some funny moments, and while I don't think Gemma Arterton is a bad actress-she was brilliant in Tess of the D'Urbevilles her chemistry with Gyllanhaal is rather dull and her character was quite vapid.",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv

29 May 2010,Hollywoodrulez,10," A fantastic piece of work
",Well having played all the games I can honestly say I didn't know what to think when I found out that Jake gyellenhaal would be playing dasdan in the film. Well as always Jake impressed me at his fullest and the film was a fantastic piece of work. I expected it to be once I knew Jerry bruckhiemer was the producer and once again he impressed me. The visual effects team on the film deserves to be credited due to there brilliant work throughout the entire movie. The last effect sold the work of the effects team to me as outstanding. I also really like the way the director chose to open and close the film with the same shot and subtitles. After the film is done you really understand why the director did that. I really hope they follow this great film up with an equally great sequel and i don't think I will be disappointed.,/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2010,Troy_Campbell,7," A rollicking good ride.
","The Sands of Time? A mythical dagger that can turn back time? A sandstorm created by the Gods that will destroy humanity? All sounds a bit rubbish, doesn't it? Well it is. And isn't. For all the silliness of the story and convenience of the plot, Persia is remarkably fun, thanks to the unhinged action set pieces which rotate through at a terrific pace. Have the characters been talking nonsense for over a minute? Never fear, in about 15 seconds Dastan will be doing something cool. Like free running on the Persian rooftops or climbing a wall using freshly shot arrows. Or maybe even battling with a whip-wielding assassin or his sword swinging brother.",/review/rw2256294/?ref_=tt_urv
