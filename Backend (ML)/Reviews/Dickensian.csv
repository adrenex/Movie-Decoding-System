3 May 2021,ThomDerd,6," It's a 6,5 and that's probably too much. Main problem: The PLOT.
",Marvel has spoiled us fans in the past. But this series is just not as good. Its not because of politics or of political correctness or of racial mentions; its because of the PLOT.,/review/rw6848642/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,9," Terrific!!
","The Falcon and The Winter Soldier is everything I thought it would be and more! We learn more about these two characters in the first episode than all the movies they're in combined! Anthony Mackie (The Falcon) and Sebastian Stan (The Winter Soldier) are both phenomenal here! If you didn't like this it's because you didn't want to because it's exactly what's been advertised in the trailers. It feels more like a movie than a tv show as it has the same look and feel of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. I've enjoyed all the Marvel shows, some more than others, and this is definitely one of the better ones. I hope they make another season because this one was pretty good.",/review/rw6848642/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,9," A must watch for any Marvel fan
",This is a must watch for any marvel fan and a great addition to the MCU! While it's not quite as good as Loki or WandaVision it's still a really good show! It's an action packed thriller from start to finish. This show will grab you and pull you into their world from the very first episode. You'll have so much fun watching this show that before you know it you'll have binged the entire season. Every episode is incredibly written. It had such high expectations and not only met those expectations but surpassed them. There's really nothing else I can say about this show that hasn't already been said.,/review/rw6848642/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,HafizhMaulana21,8," Lots of drama, lack of action
","After the events of 'Avengers:Endgame', Sam Wilson, who refused to be Captain America's successor, collaborated with Bucky Barnes in eradicating crime from a small group of organizations that had Super Soldier serum. They are both helped by a new Captain America who doesn't fit Sam's thinking.",/review/rw6848642/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2021,aidanratesmovies,4," So Disappointing
","Feeling like a bland 90's action flick- The Falcon Winter Soldier has absolutely no style and very little substance- that is any substance that can actually be useful. Out of the few times MCU works have disappointed me, The Falcon and Winter Soldier is by far the biggest disappoint so far. I was excited to see these characters grow, I feel like we hardly got a chance to focus on the character of Falcon, and Winter Soldier is just such an interesting character that I was excited to see what they did with him. Instead what we got was an incredibly dull and preachy drama with no purpose whatsoever except to fill in the gaps of future projects. I feel like this show's message is incredibly contradictory, focusing on hate and aggression, while also providing social commentary on the possibility of a black captain america. Instead of truly touching on these topics, I feel like it's just the start of a conversation they didn't know how to finish, and instead of finding that middle ground, they just jump to the conclusion and expect us to be fine with it. This show is incredibly frustrating to watch, and there is almost nothing special about it. The color scheme is a broad grey all the way throughout, and the story is so incredibly slow paced- you will easily lose interest. The new captain america suit also is a mess, with so much going on at once it's honestly just hard to look at. The actors try their best, but some can just be a little too much to handle at times, and no matter how hard they try, it's not enough to overtake the blank narrative this show is stretching along. In the end, The Falcon and Winter Soldier is an incredibly bland misstep and is easily the worst MCU project so far.",/review/rw6848642/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2021,x_manicure_x,4," Take off the Marvel logo and noone would have watched it
","Subpar show even for Marvel's standards. The plot takes forever to get going, and when it finally does, the pay-off is minimum. The end of episode four slightly raised my expectations, but it all ended in mediocre action scenes and empty political messages. Eventually, it just felt like a lazy attempt to introduce further films and boost Disney+ subscriptions.",/review/rw6848642/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2021,Dog-River,3," It Could've Been Awesome
","I love the on/off screen chemistry between Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie, so I was excited to watch this series. But I am so beyond frustrated that the writers/director decided to ruin what could've been a legendary show. The overall plot is just bad. Two great characters (Sam and Bucky) and the majority of the time all they do is talk. This is supposed to be an action superhero series, not a drama. The couple action scenes with Sam and Bucky are decent though.",/review/rw6848642/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,tylerdburns-81322,9," Amazing Motives and an Amazing Captain America
","The thirty sixth entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, also known as Captain America and the Winter Soldier, or what it should be known as in my opinion, Captain America and the White Wolf, is an amazing entry to this universe, and greatly expands on two characters lives. Not much casting is present here, but the little bit here was done perfect, as always. The continuation of the storyline started by Avengers: Endgame had unexpected turns, and was done fantastically. Seeing Sam take up the role of Captain America while also exploring the complicated history of that role was done beautifully. Seeing Bucky slowly recovering from his years as a brainwashed assassin was done less so, but was still effective. How the United States government decided to choose their own ""Captain America"" who may have been the worst possible candidate is honestly one of the most realistic things in film. The return of Zemo was unexpected but greatly appreciated. The villains of the series had a realistic and believable motive, and ultimately weren't purely villains persay, but some of the pieces of storyline were just too cartoonish. Overall though, a great addition to the MCU, and has me excited for the future.",/review/rw6848642/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2021,Cineanalyst,3," MCU Contracts to Television
","This is what I was afraid of when I heard the Marvel Cinematic Universe was being downsized to television and other personal screens for streaming. Mind-numbingly intricate character development, nonsensical political struggle, and TV filler. We don't merely see superheroes and villains knock each other around, we see them walking to the fighting destinations and talking incessantly to delay those confrontations. The same arguments replayed over several different episodes. I didn't want to watch Sam and Bucky fix a boat, or Sam apply for a bank loan, or Bucky talk in circles with a shrink. And, I doubt the post-blip politics of a war on terror over national borders or whatever could be more vaguely inconsequential. Sam's speech at the end was atrociously artificial--a supposedly moving speech to rally the common folk as engineered by Disney executives. The generic fanaticism of the Flag Smashers even worse.",/review/rw6848642/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,Reviews_of_the_Dead,7," Interesting Ideas and Concepts, Too Much Filler
","I'll be honest, my original thought was that I wasn't going to watch these Marvel series. There were a couple reasons I changed my mind. The first was that a website I saw had these as part of canon and I was intrigued to see where they were going to go with the overarching story now that Thanos is eliminated and who the new villain would be. The other is that I could feed my newborn daughter while watching these. Plus, they count as a movie on Letterboxd.",/review/rw6848642/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2022,strabgerthings,7," The Falcon and the Winter Soldier - A Decent Enough Slow Burn
",The beginning of this show is pretty good in my opinion. The first three episodes and especially four are very solid. I do have some problems with them but i found them mostly enjoyable. After that the shows kind of falls off. Most of the Marvel shows suffer from rushed finales because of the stupid 6 episode format and this one is no exception.,/review/rw6848642/?ref_=tt_urv

10 July 2022,kobemackenzie,8," A good marvel show to watch for any marvel fan or not.
",The falcon and the winter soldier was one of my favourite Marvel shows. The show's focus is about Sam taking on the mantle of Captain America which he doesn't think he deserves. Bucky wants to know why he would pass on the title of Captain America. Well at the same time they must track down a New terrorist threat called the flag smashers. The government wanting someone to take the mantle of Captain America gets a new man for the job. The show follows a good written story but it is very political really going at it with the cops taking it to far.,/review/rw6848642/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,toseale,8," The New Captain America Rocks
","A great passing of the torch, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a great continuation of the Captain America vibes. Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russel, and Erin Kellyman were amazing. Wyatt Russel did a little too good of a job at becoming a character to hate. It was great to see familiar faces and continue Steve's legacy, especially through Sam Wilson. The chemistry between Sam and Bucky really helped the show as a whole, making the entire show funny and emotional. It also hits some hard topics for America, something some would complain about, but was still needed for the show. I can't wait to see how Sam handles the mantle of Captain America in the future, as I know he'll be great.",/review/rw6848642/?ref_=tt_urv

","From time to time I still dare to try one of the new superhero-movies/shows of those movie factories named DC and Marvel (hope dies last etc.). But long gone are the times where the announcement of a new movie or show made by DC or Marvel would get me nervous with expectation. Anyway, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is just another mass product, a soulless clone of a clone of a clone that gets published/aired every month.

","So to preface, I'm actually kind of super-heroed-out at the moment. There were too many shows and series coming out in the last few years that I got burnt out. I got Disney+ for some Star Wars content instead and started TFatWS on a whim, playing it in the background, but over time I started noticing how much I was drawn into the series.",/review/rw6848642/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2021,TheVictoriousV,4," A bland show that reveals important facts about the activists of today
","The latest products from Marvel Studios have been some of their most unintentionally illuminating. WandaVision, their first Disney+ exclusive, showed us what sort of in-text behavior the Twitter stans will let slide (partly because the text in question does little to decry said behavior) when the themes/metaphors are somewhat poignant and, more importantly, the star of the show is really hot (which I can't dispute, since it's Elizabeth Olsen). The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, meanwhile, is the most relevant and revealing show they've ever made, for wholly unintended reasons.",/review/rw6848642/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2021,RussHog,2," I wanted to like this...
","Much like Wanda Vision, the two the main actors are great. But the writing is awful. It feels like twelve year olds wrote this. Why does Falcon even want to be Captain America? Why are the bad guys so uninspired? Who thinks Elaine from Seinfeld is a good mystery villain? The end of this show is really preachy and the poor guy who plays Falcone has to deliver the dumbest lines of all time. The pain black people have gone though in this country is brutal and they deserve way better than this garbage.",/review/rw6848642/?ref_=tt_urv
