","Greetings again from the darkness. Who among us isn't intrigued by a real life ""unsolved"" murder mystery? Throw in a very wealthy New York real estate family, a never-discovered body, an executed friend, and a horrible childhood trauma and it is certain to draw the attention of filmmaker Andrew Jarecki. Jarecki's film ""Capturing the Friedmans"" won numerous awards and is among the best documentaries ever made. He has a knack with dark family secrets.",/review/rw2499620/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2010,gradyharp,9," Stranger then Fiction
","ALL THINGS GOOD is a polished little film based on a true story that while it may not have the visual gruesome detail of the usual thriller tropes of films, it is terrifying in its presentation of personality variations that produce a shuddering reaction on a purely intellectual level for the audience. It is both a love story and a missing persons/murder mystery based on a still unsolved case that continues to haunt New York investigators and reporters and detectives. What writers Marcus Hinchey and Marc Smerling have created from known and newly discovered facts, speculation and court records results in a psychological examination of a powerful New York family, obsession, love and loss. The film relates incidents that began in 1972 and end in 2003 and at this time the truth is still unknown. Director Andrew Jarecki uses a superb cast and a fine sense of voice-over narration to interweave the puzzling history with the gradual dissolution of each of the characters involved.

18 December 2010,mgorman-6,6," well-executed 'exhumation' of an unsolved murder
","In All Good Things, the director/writer has created a plausible fiction to account for a series of actual crimes. The evolution of the supposed killer from carefree youth to malignant immoralist is depicted, step by step. The strength of the movie as a story lies in its focus on a web of characters and their relationships to one another, rather than on the crimes themselves. We never see actual violence, but only its effects on characters, and their subsequent efforts to conceal the truth, to escape from their situation, or to satisfy some personal need. The movie functions mainly as a kind of indictment, and I wonder if it would work were it not for the 'documentary' angle, the movie as crusader for the truth, bringing to light the possible culpability of a real person, abetted by certain friends and family, a man as yet unpunished.",/review/rw2499620/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2010,drownsoda90,9," Think, 'Oscar-worthy ""Unsolved Mysteries"" Segment.'
","""All Good Things"" is based on the infamous life and media circus around Robert Durst, an New York heir to billions, infamous for the string of murders and disappearances that have revolved around him for three decades. For those familiar with his story, the film will reacquaint you and surprise you. For those who have never heard of him, it will be even more shocking. The characters' names in the film are altered slightly, but the story is nonetheless the same. Ryan Gosling plays David Marks, who meets Katie McCarthy (Kirsten Dunst) in 1971; Katie comes from a middle-class background, while David comes from billions of dollars of old New England money. The two fall madly in love and are married soon after, but their relationship deteriorates over the next decade. David becomes abusive toward Katie, and they eventually end up living in separate houses as Katie studies at medical school while David works in New York City under his dad's company. In 1982, Katie vanishes without a trace. Fast-forward to 2000, and David is living under the identity of a woman in Texas; the deaths of friend/publisher Deborah Lehrman and the gruesome murder of elderly Malvern Bump reignite interest in Katie's 18-year-old disappearance. They all have one thing in common: David Marks.",/review/rw2499620/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2010,stiff5,7," Spectacular performances by Dunst and Gosling!
","""All Good Things"" is a love story and murder mystery set against the backdrop of a New York real estate dynasty in the 1980s. Directed by Andrew Jarecki (director of the Academy Award-nominated doc Capturing the Friedmans), the film was inspired by the story of Robert Durst, scion of the wealthy Durst family. Mr. Durst was suspected but never tried for killing his wife Kathie who disappeared in 1982 and was never found. The film stars Ryan Gosling as David Marks, Kirsten Dunst as Katie McCarthy, and Frank Langella as David's father, Sanford Marks.",/review/rw2499620/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2011,sddavis63,1," A Painful Waste Of Time
","Some movies are bad. You get to the end and you wonder why you bothered watching them. And then some movies are painful. ""All Good Things"" falls into the ""painful"" category. Was this a story that deserved to be told? It's based on the story of Robert Durst (whose name is changed in the movie to David Marks, played by Ryan Gosling.) The details (as far as they're known) of Durst's life are fairly well presented. The story revolves around the troubled relationship David has with his real estate mogul family, and with his deteriorating relationship with his wife Kathleen, played by Kirsten Dunst. Eventually Kathleen disappears, and to this day no one knows what happened to her.",/review/rw2499620/?ref_=tt_urv

","Let me begin with the acting. Very strong and good acting from all the major players on this film. Something you could expect, when you read the cast list. The story is decent too, but you might feel there is something missing (or maybe it was just me). Especially if you have seen similar movies.",/review/rw2499620/?ref_=tt_urv

","The dysfunctional family of David Marks appears to have scarred him. His mother's death at a young age seems to haunt him. He is the eldest son of a shady, demanding real estate mogul and seems uncomfortable following in his father's footstep and getting involved in this financial empire. He seems bored, disconnected. One day he meets Katie McCarthy, a sunny and enthusiastic young woman. The story, taking place over several decades, explores their growing relationship and how the weight of David's dark legacy makes it all spiral down. ",/review/rw2499620/?ref_=tt_urv

","I had never heard this story before, and found it very interesting in a way that kept me wanting more to see of this film.This movie kept me entertained almost the whole time. has some boring moments like every movie, but still a fantastic movie to enjoy on a weekday. I recommend it to film lovers who wants something more then the usual crap Hollywood has been giving us lately. It's not an Oscar movie, but it in my opinion it deserve high points at IMDb.",/review/rw2499620/?ref_=tt_urv

Eventually they abandon the failing food store, and he reluctantly joins the family business. He starts to change. She can't divorce him because he has no money of his own.

","All Good Things is a film that's 'based on a true story.' However, I've lost count of the amount of times I've seen those words, only to find that the movie was so loosely based on reality that it might as well have been Star Wars. Yet, with All Good Things, it really is based on a real murder/missing persons case in America from the eighties.",/review/rw2499620/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie was not that great, it was OK for what it was. It's about a seemingly nice guy whom comes from a rich family falling for a girl whom comes from a lesser background. They get married and he seems great. But suddenly he starts acting weird and violent. He starts beating his wife and getting into arguments and being distant. She consults a lawyer and is told his money is in trusts and she would not be able to get much in a divorce. So she sticks around and just disappears. The police never find a body and the husband never gets charged. He goes to Texas and for some unknown reason likes to dress like a woman. I didn't get that part. He kills some guy there, but gets convicted of a lesser charge, so never spends much time in jail.",/review/rw2499620/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2011,tigerfish50,4," Good work tossed away in a docudrama final act
","""All Good Things"" provides a text-book example of the inherent weaknesses in drama projects based on real-life events. The first two-thirds of this film has a strong script coupled with excellent performances, direction and cinematography, all working harmoniously together to tell the story of a doomed love affair between David and Katie Marks. David is the eldest son of the patriarch of a wealthy and politically connected NY real estate family. His attractive facade conceals a fragile interior damaged through witnessing the violent suicide of his mother at a young age. He desires to live a simple life with the warmhearted, uncomplicated Katie, but his controlling father forces him to work in the part of the family business that hosts Times Square prostitution rackets. The internal and external pressures undermine David's stability, and the couple's marriage deteriorates into mutual distrust, substance abuse and physical assault - followed by Katie's suspicious disappearance.",/review/rw2499620/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2010,mbs,7," Chilly but watchable cold case file. re-enactment
","Solid true crime story has the feel of real life to it in the most important part--the details. Even when the plot makes a swerve towards ""oh i can't believe that's what really happened for a second"" territory--its the little details and short scenes that makes it feels true to life. (i'm thinking of the scene where Kristen dunst painfully mails this evidence indicting her husband to the senator only to have him mail it back to her husband the next day--""this is family business...and none of our affair"", or the quick scene of Ryan gosling writing his phone number on the boat ""in case it gets lost"", or the terse ""Leave A Message"" greeting on Gosling's hideaway's answering machine every time someone calls.) There are a lot of little things like that throughout that really make the movie pop.",/review/rw2499620/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2010,saadgkhan,5," All Good things has only One thing good and that's ""Kirsten Dunst"".
","ALL GOOD THINGS – CATCH IT (Only for Kirsten Dunst) ( B- ) All Good things has only One thing good and that's ""Kirsten Dunst"", she is the only one who kept me glue to the movie and the moment she got lost, I kind of lost too in my mind. Kirsten Dunst really put herself out there in the movie and I think it was her best performance till date. Her portrayal of the young lover, sweet wife & sister later on turn into agonizing wife on drugs was simply startling. On the other hand Ryan Gosling was also very powerful in both young & old person but where he lost me was his portrayal of a drag. At sometimes he looked the part but most of the times it looked completely bogus. The movie has lots of problems from writing to direction & even to supporting cast. When every supporting un-known cast/character shown on the screen, it seemed like he/she is an important character though later on we even don't see or hear from that character atall. The movie lost me completely the moment Kirsten Dunst vanishing off the screen, as the movie is based upon a true story and Katie Marks (Original name: Kathleen McCormack) was never found after her disappearance. Though, the movie indicated that what had happened to her but it never fully fill out the gaps in the case. Why David Marks (Original name: Robert Durst) was let go? All the incidents happening in the movie, like beating her up in front of her family (which was incredibly weird because why her family didn't stopped him), neighbors found Kirsten Dunst all beaten up and Ryan Gosling's mental schizophrenics state of mind etc etc were depicted in the movie & those were never taken in consideration in the jury's verdict plus why Ryan Gosling was never suspected in Kirsten Dunst disappearance??? These are the questions which movie has failed to answer; I think if the director & writers were not capable of joining the evidence, they should have not made a movie on an ""unsolved disappearance of Kathleen McCormack"". Overall the movie is watchable because of its first 80 minutes (Kirsten Dunst) only and the last 30 minutes of the movie are completely ridiculous.",/review/rw2499620/?ref_=tt_urv
