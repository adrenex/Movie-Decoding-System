","An intense, entertaining, nostalgic-comic epic, like Mad Men with a knowing wink or five to the people who remember exercise videos, Mercedes 123s and no internet.",/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2021,Acid_Reflex,8," Can't believe the low rating!
",I can't believe this has such a low imdb rating. I watched the first 3 episodes and am hooked. It's dark and twisted just enough so far. Hope it stays this good and earns a 2nd season.,/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2022,GoalDigs,," Amazing
","A couple of months ago, after 10 minutes of watching I turned it off as I was expecting something different. Last night, I wanted different and oh my word, this is brilliant!! I binge watched season one in one go and then season two.",/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2021,rolbyh2002,8," Something Different & Original
","Rose Byrne rocks. Is her character totally likeable? Maybe not initially, but you grow to love her as you come to understand that she struggles deeply with self-loathing and body image issues, and she feels stuck in her life. She's the woman who's smarter than the men in the room, but she doesn't have a place in the board room. A feminist tale that doesn't try to be sweet or inspiring, but somehow ends up being inspiring despite it's dark edge. Dramedy. Darkly funny but also serious.",/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2021,Opinate,8," Loving this original new series.
","It captures the heart of being a woman in the eighties so well. Split a dozen ways, trying to keep your head above water as you fulfill everyone else's needs. If only you are thin and pretty enough you will be happy. Nailed it. Byrne's character even has a bit of the snarky feminist attitude leftover from the seventies.",/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2021,kimkdg,9," Terribly misrepresenting trailer
","Whoever did the trailer and write up for this one scared a lot of people off-I almost didn't watch-it's really not about a woman making an exercise video or finding herself through exercise.....it's a dark and hard look at bulimia, the role/portrayal/treatment of women in the 80s, and abusive relationships. Rose Byrne and Deidre Friel are particularly excellent in this! Edgy and unexpected, a great watch.",/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2021,gabriella-71231,10," Freaking love it!
",Totally get it. If you're in this generation you'll definitely get it. Fan of Rose Byrne!,/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2021,jaimemedina-36288,8," New guilty pleasure
","Love everything about this show. The internal dialogue is dark, cutting, and hilarious. The 80's setting adds to the comedy and brings a note of nostalgia for those of us who loved it. Obsession, addiction, sex, and delusion are all in the menu.",/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2021,Russoguru,," Rose Byrne is once again, outstanding.
","Rose Byrne isn't just a great actress, she's also sexy as all hell and somehow pulls off the whole ""almost Jennifer Beals"" look in this charming and fun snapshot of my favorite decade. I'm serious, I love Rose Byrne, and she can ""get it"", as the young people say.",/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2021,Dragonborn64,8," Go for the Byrne
","I've liked Physical from the get go but I can't lie - at points I thought - what is this about? Rose Byrne as always is great as Sheila, a bulimic, self hating (with inner voice to prove it) lost soul in the early 80s. Her loving but deluded husband loses his job snd decides to run for office and she discovers aerobics and her own lack of morality. There's almost a Breaking Bad type of theme. Throughout the supporting characters are angry, unfulfilled women and selfish, childish men - with the exception of maybe Lou Taylor Pucci ( great name) For women to get things done, it often takes a lot of scheming to keep away the prying, critical make eye. All the women begin to discover their own strengths. Anyway, I ramble but it's very good. One of the better streaming offers of late IMHO.",/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2021,elizabethcaroline,10," 80's obsession with weight loss was real!
","100% nailed the 80's obsession with weight loss - from Crystal Light to aerobics. This was a decade where women were encouraged to put themselves Second. Rose Burn plays a wife and mother searching for meaning, and taking control over the one thing she can - her weight. It's a time when it was okay for men to make decisions for women. Thankfully, this is a show about a woman who took her life back.",/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2021,zbwyws,10," Excellent
",Thank You so much for finally creating a series that's real that I can truly relate to! I have battled this disease my whole life. It's about time it's brought to attention.,/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2021,adrian-m-miller,10," Rose, as always, brilliant
","Rose has been largely underappreciated, but when shes given the right vehicle, she nails it like few can. And as an Aussie my bias for her is more down to her ability to swear properly, as only Aussies and Scots can.",/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv

",I want to see where this goes. Lots of characters and development hopefully setting up something great. It's good but might be great. We shall see.,/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2022,Sweet-Harmony,," Show gets stronger and more engrossing with each episode
",Apple TV shows that have proper arc and narrative. Unique and a with their own vision unlike the reproduced regurgitation that continues to appear on Netflix. Whilst Netflix continues to cancel its best shows and anything deemed slow burner Apple is getting it right and this is a great case in point. Six episodes in and you will find yourself connected to these characters the story and the ensuring chaos that lurks around the corner. Unpredictable and intriguing. Loving it.,/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2021,simoneclash,8," Dark, funny and really enjoyable
","Watched the first 4 episodes and got hooked on it. Good acting, dark, funny, love Robe Byrne, she is always very good but as rest of the cast in this case.",/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2022,BlueLake22,8," Great acting in this mostly dark but sometimes funny look at 1980s upper middle class SoCal culture.
","I know some have been turned off by the portrayal of disordered eating but it eases up in the Second season. The acting is really excellent. The soundtrack is quintessential 1980s. The story lines are interesting views of dysfunction, making this viewer feel sad for some characters, while also enjoying the occasionally witty and laugh-inducing moments. It's an interesting look at the complexities womanhood (and personhood in general) in this era.",/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2021,julieshotmail,7," Rooting for Sheila
","Sheila is a broken woman with many secrets, captivatingly portrayed by the always-fascinating and beautiful Rose Byrne. She is friendly and supportive on the outside, but simmering with anger and ambition inside. From the beginning, you sympathize and want to root for her, hoping that one day she will get what she desires and be wildly successful at it. That desire can be anything, but in this series it's the birth of aerobics in the early 80s, so the show immerses you in that distinctive music, that distinctive hair, and those distinctive clothes and makeup. It's fabulous! With that backdrop, we get to know Sheila more deeply as she journeys her way through her husband's campaign, her wife and mother responsibilities, her own health issues, and her relationships with neighbors, ""friends,"" colleagues, and family. In the end, I am really rooting for her, however she does something unexplainable that almost seems out of character. Yes, she has dark secrets and is very ambitious, but it is just not in her to backstab Bunny like that - the same Bunny who showed her the ropes and has never done anything bad to her. If anything, knowing what we know about Sheila by episode 10, she is very grateful to Bunny for giving her a chance to be part of the whole thing.",/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2022,bnitcamela,8," Darkly funny 80s themed melodrama
","Biggest kick I got out of reading reviews is that some people are angry that ""sweet"" Rose Byrne is playing a horrible, selfish, self-hating, bulimic person. Um, that's the sign of a good actor, folks.",/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2022,mykl-spader,8," Get Physical
","I am not sure why there are low ratings, but I am guessing people do not watch a lot of dark comedies. That is what the show is, unfortunately the listing says comedy - so people expect flat-out jokes over the satire and commentary.",/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2021,Movie_Fanatic_Down_Under,10," Addictive and Enchanting
",I love the honesty this shows brings to what life can be like for a woman. People are complaining in other reviews about too much negative self-talk in the show but for some of us that is what life can be like. Glad to see such a relatable character in a show. Will keep watching!,/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2021,firstelement,10," Dark, fearless and relatable
","Rose Byrne is amazing and everything she did but this one is a very, very different role for her and I cannot get enough of it! That voice inside your head is loud and strong in this series and I am glad for it. The only regret I have is that now I have to wait for the rest of the season because I watched the first 3 episodes in one go.",/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2021,kendra-kovach,8," Solid Gold
","Great Acting, interesting story. After the first 2 episodes it picks up steam. I'm really enjoying a dive into the 80's and into the mind of a woman with a eating disorder. I thought it was brilliant how you can see what low self worth takes over and what you are willing to settle for. Don't listen to the ratings on this one,they probably didn't really give it a chance, those are the same people who give Grey's Anatomy 10 stars.",/review/rw7299657/?ref_=tt_urv
