30 June 2021,masonsaul,9," Best DC animated movie in years
","Batman: The Long Halloween, Part One is the best DC animated movie in years, a dark, atmospheric and suspenseful crime drama. Jensen Ackles is a surprisingly great Batman, Troy Baker is reliably perfect as Joker and Naya Rivera, Josh Duhamel and Billy Burke are all great. The animation is excellent and Chris Palmer's direction is really good. The music by Michael Gatt is good. It's reasonably well paced although some of the time jumps are a little jarring.",/review/rw7072738/?ref_=tt_urv

","The first part of a movie that is split into two parts, Batman: The Long Halloween Part One is the first half of the latest DC Animated Movie. Based on the critically acclaimed thirteen-issue limited series that lasted a year (from December of 1996 to December of 1997), this movie, set during Batman's early years as a crime fighter, as he was called in when the nephew of mob boss Carmine Falcone is found murdered after agreeing to aid Harvey Dent with taking him down, causing the caped crusader and district attorney to join forces to take down the Falcone crime family. However, things take a turn for the worst as a Holiday Killer is on the prowl, killing various gangsters on Falcone's side on holidays, and Harvey is showing a darker side in his war against Falcone.",/review/rw7072738/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2021,blanbrn,9," Well done animated take of the graphic novel of the holiday killer!

All this blends an underworld of corruption and terror, along the way as Batman becomes involved Catwoman and the Joker play key figures in the chain of events with twist! If you like D. C. comics then yes watch this.",/review/rw7072738/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2021,StephenRcribb,9," Batman Year Two
",Fans have been disappointed by recent animated adaptations of Killing Joke and Hush. I've been more disappointed by the recent batch of animated films like the boring voice cast for Justice Society and the Batman-less Soul Of The Dragon. I'm pleased to say they've delivered an outstanding part one of the Long Halloween. I was thoroughly entertained. The voice cast is fantastic. Naya is quite possibly the best animated Catwoman for me. Troy Baker delivers a spot on Joker channelling Mark Hamill which adds to the atmosphere and style of the Batman animated series from 1992. All this adds up to a win win release.,/review/rw7072738/?ref_=tt_urv

9 July 2021,eprissel,9," A great first part
","The long Halloween part one is a fascinating and awesome start to this two parter. Even if sometimes the movements of the characters can be stilted at times it makes it up with other great elements in the animation (the action scenes and the designs), the acting is great (Jensen ackles and josh duhamel especially), the action is fun, the story is great (so far), it takes its time (which sets a pretty great atmosphere), the characters are fascinating to watch and the ending offers a good shock. A great animated Batman film and I hope the second part lives up to it.",/review/rw7072738/?ref_=tt_urv

","Inspired by the iconic mid-1990s DC story from Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale, Batman: The Long Halloween, Part One begins as a brutal murder on Halloween prompts Gotham's young vigilante, the Batman, to form a pact with the city's only two uncorrupt lawmen (Police Captain James Gordan and District Attorney Harvey Dent) in order to take down The Roman, head of the notorious and powerful Falcone Crime Family. But when more deaths occur on Thanksgiving and Christmas, it becomes clear that, instead of ordinary gang violence, they're also dealing with a serial killer - the identity of whom, with each conflicting clue, grows harder to discern. Few cases have ever tested the wits of the World's Greatest Detective like the mystery behind the Holiday Killer.",/review/rw7072738/?ref_=tt_urv

",It's nice to see dc going back to there original roots instead of having these films in a shears universe I really think this is one of the best things dc had put out animated wise since dark knight returns hush I liked till I saw the ending and I was massively disappointed in really excited for part 2 and I hope they don't change the ending to much like hush but so far what I've seen it's really good when they announced this I was excited but also worried as dc animated film recently haven't been that good if im being honest but I'm glad I was wrong.,/review/rw7072738/?ref_=tt_urv

",The animation the tone the background music the cast everything is excellent in setting up the type of the batman animated movie we would like to see. It portrays batman in his early years so he has less of detective skill than we are used to which may be covered in part 2 but this movie is as satisfying as a batman movie could be.

25 December 2021,koltonbrett,9," The great detective tackles a great mystery.
","Compared to other DC animated movies, there isn't much action here, but there is so much story. We see a very human Batman who has to use his detective skills more than his gadgets. The Long Halloween is a very serious movie with complicated relationships. Though many of Batman's most famous villains make appearances, the more ordinary characters make this movie special. After already providing an excellent performance voicing the Red Hood in Under the Red Hood, Jenson Ackles is back, but is the voice of Batman this time. This is also one of the last works from actress Naya Rivera who tragically drowned in July of 2020. She gave us the voice of Catwoman, who is a light in this dark story. Her contribution to this work of art helped make it one of the best DC animated experiences. There were times when The Long Halloween felt more like a series than a movie, and I believe that a series would have been the best way to tell this story. There is so much story to unpack and at times things felt rushed. But they did an excellent job with the time they had. The mystery sucked me right in and as hard as I tried to put the clues together, I couldn't solve the mystery before Batman did.",/review/rw7072738/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2021,judywalker2,10," Now this is Batman
","Now this is the Batman I've been waiting for, take some notes DC live action films. Though it's a little shy on dialog the animation is great and the characters very fleshed out. I agree with the casts when they said ""Jensen Ackles was born to play Batman."" Too bad it came too late for all the terrible movies. He has the Kevin Conroy voice and that's the Batman I know and love. The rest of the voiced cast is great as well. I'm not sure exactly where the story is going but I'm along for the ride. I wish Jensen could be Batman for a JLA movie, that would be great.",/review/rw7072738/?ref_=tt_urv

4 September 2021,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," Celebrate with a bang.
","'Batman: The Long Halloween, Part One (2021)' is an animated crime-thriller in which Batman teams up with district attorney Harvey Dent and police commissioner Jim Gordon to take down the Falcone criminal family, while also solving a series of murders that take place solely on public holidays. The picture is, first and foremost, a detective story. It has a few action set-pieces, of course, but it's mainly concerned with its central mystery and the way in which it relates to its wider 'cops vs gangsters' conflict. This sets it apart from many of its counterparts and makes it feel much closer to a traditional crime-thriller than something more typically 'superhero'. The film, along with its accompanying 'Part Two' sequel, is based on the famous graphic novel of the same name, though it makes some major alterations to the story from what I understand. That's not an issue for me, but I can see why people expecting a straight adaptation could be disappointed. For the most part, the film is enjoyable. It has its slower moments and, as a whole, doesn't really feel like a complete narrative (because, for all intents and purposes, it isn't). However, it's generally rather intriguing, constantly engaging and occasionally exciting. It gets you involved with its mystery, keeping you guessing as to who 'Holiday' could be, and it plays with some interesting themes of grey morality. Its structure is also somewhat unique, with its events taking place solely on the holidays that end with murder, and it has several cameos from the eclectic members of Batman's rogues' gallery. Overall, it's a compelling mystery-thriller with some enjoyable action and a mature, thematically rich story. 7/10.",/review/rw7072738/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2021,kimberleyrigg,10," Love Detective Batman!
","Very well done and has set the scene perfectly for Part 2. The cast has to be the best collective group that they have put together for a long time and they all nailed their roles. I particularly liked early Bats / Bruce and Calendar Man was just down right creepy. I really liked the animation the fight and snowy Gotham scenes where amazing. I am expecting a lot more action in Part 2 and some of my favourite moments from the comics.....please, please do not let it disappoint.",/review/rw7072738/?ref_=tt_urv

9 July 2021,jadediamond,5," Not For Me
","I guess my era of DC animated movies began with Batman: Mask of The Phantasm and ended with the New 52, Justice League Dark: Apokolips War. I gave this movie two tries but I could not get into it. The voice acting was good with a slight adjustment to not hearing the iconic Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill as the voices of Batman and The Joker, respectively. The beautiful Naya Rivera did an amazing job voicing Selina in her final role. This is a true Masked Detective story in the early years of Batman before Robin and the future Batgirl as a kid excited about going trick or treating with her dad. The action is very slow or nearly non existent except during the final few minutes of the film. I did not like the animation drawing style with paper cardboard characters. The post credit scene was meh. The movie was very dry and slow. There was more exposition than actual story being shown. For example, Selina had an entire relationship with Bruce off screen then they break up at a boat party. We never saw their relationship in the movie. When did Selina find out Batman was Bruce and why was he so nonchalant when she blurted out his identity? Better adaptations of Catwoman and Batman's relationship were shown in movies like Hush and Batman: Gaslight By Gotham. In other versions of Batman, there was action and suspense being supported by a great film or television score, this movie had neither. It was also weird hearing the bad guys constantly telling Batman how bad his detective skills were. Harvey Dent was also an uninteresting character in this adaptation along with his relationship with his disenchanted wife and their martial problems. I guess the house explosion was to trick the audience into thinking Harvey was becoming TwoFace and how they survived it made absolutely no sense to me. I was not feeling this movie at all. I did not like how the characters were drawn with the exception of Selina.",/review/rw7072738/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2021,fahimmkhan,8," Not the best Detective as we thought!
","Definitely has a good story to it, don't expect too much action like other DC animated movies. Less detective work from the Bats to be honest. Voice casting seems perfect, though really sad to hear about Naya Rivera. Can't wait for Part two, how it all ends.",/review/rw7072738/?ref_=tt_urv

","Where is the development? Things happen and there are long action scenes. The events cover almost a year and in that time some relationship do a 180 but there is no real reason to care because 2 moments they have is their establishment and their disintegration, they don't feel real. The investigation is almost non existent and story flails from one suspect to another without any substantive clues beyond lack of options.",/review/rw7072738/?ref_=tt_urv
