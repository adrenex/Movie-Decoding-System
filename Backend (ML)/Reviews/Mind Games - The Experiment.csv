11 July 2008,ThreeSadTigers,," A rare cinematic treat, a film that takes us to another world
","Without wishing to fall into the trap of critical hyperbole, I can honestly say that this is the most original and impressive American film that I've seen this decade, more so than the highly acclaimed likes of The Departed (2006) or No Country for Old Men (2007). Whatever problems you might have with Gibson, from his personal politics to his previous work, there is no denying the determination of his vision, or the sheer sense of daring and imagination in attempting to pull off a project of this size and pitch; taking elements of an already well-documented real life civilisation and abstracting it for the purposes of dramatic tension, to create a once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience that genuinely takes us to a world that we've never before experienced on film.",/review/rw4340189/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2008,mstomaso,8," The opinion of a professional archaeologist
","I've been a professional archaeologist for 21 yrs. And despite having only worked on a few projects involving the Maya, I am well aware of the vast cinematic license used in Apocalypto - as well as the many aspects of Mayan life that the film's creators got right. My purpose however, is not to discuss ANY of this. Rather, I want to appreciate the film for exactly what it is - an entertaining and heroic story set in ancient Mesoamerica with the usual Mel Gibson attention to atmospheric use of details. The actors speak Mayan, but this is not The Passion of Kukulcan. The script nicely shows the range of customs and culture that actually thrived in Post-Classic Mayan times, and for once, depicts Native Americans as people with senses of humor! The costuming and sets are amazing and the warfare is honestly and brutally depicted.",/review/rw4340189/?ref_=tt_urv

3 July 2015,Leofwine_draca,10," An all-time favourite adventure film
","While I enjoyed Mel Gibson's last historical epic, Passion of the Christ, I found it a bit lacking in heart. The focus was on viscera and the downbeat story was just too tough to enjoy. When I heard his latest movie was an action adventure about the ancient Mayans, I was pumped and pretty sure I'd enjoy it.",/review/rw4340189/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2006,socrates99,9," I couldn't believe two hours had gone by that quickly
","Having some Mexican-Indian blood in me, I've always been interested in what I could read about the Aztecs and Mayans and others. But never did I achieve as elaborate a vision in my head, try as I might, as Mel Gibson has with the beautiful Apocalypto. Is it accurate? I've more than just strong doubts in at least one case, but like all good fiction, it probably tells more truth, despite its inaccuracies, than a dozen scholarly tomes. The movie is engrossing and, even more difficult, plausible and quite evocative. I would have bet any amount of money that this movie was impossible to make. And though some have complained that the film's ending involves an historical inaccuracy, I think there was more than enough reason to put it in.",/review/rw4340189/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2018,classicsoncall,10," ""Beware the man who brings the jaguar.""
","Whether intentional or inadvertent, what director Mel Gibson did here was cast a light on the true history of the world in microcosm, that civilizations rise and fall via the aggressive use of force. And that leaders of warrior tribes rely on fear, courage, power and the threat of death to maintain their supremacy, not only at the top of their own hierarchy, but in the conquest of weaker tribes. A little superstition goes a long way too, as in taking advantage of an unexpected eclipse of the sun to silence and cast terror into the masses. Not to mention a literal translation of an implicit threat that heads will roll. ",/review/rw4340189/?ref_=tt_urv

3 November 2007,planktonrules,9," Exceptionally tough to watch due to its violence, but also almost impossible to stop watching
","The film, believe it or not, is shot entirely with subtitles--using what was purported to be a recreation of a Mayan-type tongue for the film to heighten its realism (though the exact language has been lost). Considering the film was set just before first contact with the Western world, this was a daring but intelligent choice.",/review/rw4340189/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2007,ccrivelli2005,10," Not Your Typical Mayan Family Drama
","A family drama like no other. Two hours plus that rush at the speed of light. This is cinema. I'm sorry but it is. Don't look for inner meanings. This is the work of one of the greatest artists of our time. Yes, I'm talking about Mel Gibson. And as most of the great artists, he's bound to be controversial, erratic and infuriating sometimes but, thank God he exists. He's always going to surprise us for better or worse in sickness and in health. There are no intellectual under pinnings here. This is an adventure flick that takes us to places we've never been before. It entertains and moves and startles. Masterfully shot at a breathless pace that never, ever, lets go. And then, of course, the acting - if you can call it that. The most remarkable performances by an ensemble cast of unknowns. Gloroious faces that speak louder than words. Well, as you may have guessed. I'm overwhelmed by the experience. Thank you Mel, thank you very much.",/review/rw4340189/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," love this movie highly recommend.
","Epic. I fell in love with all the main characters. This movie is so exciting you just can't turn away . Dramatic, exciting, emotional, beautiful story of good versing evil. Even though the story involves the natives of Central America circa 1511 there is a moral implication than can be applied to modern America. The Mayan Empirical governing body had become so vile and corrupt that it's collapse was inevitable. Tribes and villagers who wanted to live solitary and peaceful lives were being attacked by the Mayans. The story is just amazing.",/review/rw4340189/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2019,joemccoy-72932,," A masterclass in filmmaking
","This film proves that the crazy guy Mel Gibson is a genius of sorts. With Apocalypto, Mel Gibson has proven it's possible to create a compelling action/adventure film in almost any setting. Gibson's theme is that all great civilizations fail when they begin to rot from the inside. Over the next 2 1/4 hours, he provides glimpses into the degeneracy of the Mayan society on the eve of its encounter with the Spanish conquistadores. However, Apocalypto is not a political tract or a dissertation about why the Mayan age came to an end. Instead, it's a high-octane adventure that concludes with one of the most intense extended chase sequences in recent movie history.",/review/rw4340189/?ref_=tt_urv

19 March 2008,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," I don't know what to say other than this is an incredible movie
","I have to confess, when I saw the trailer for Apocalypto a couple years ago, but it looked over done and boring. When I was at Hollywood Video, I couldn't really decide on a film and just decided to see what this was about. I watched Apocalypto last night and I have to say that this is one of the most memorable films that I have seen in a while. I mean, this film had my whole attention, while the violence is most definitely disturbing to an extreme point, the story is absolutely incredible and wonderful. It's rare now days to have an original movie in Hollywood, everything is always ripped off or paid as an ""omage"" to something, or is a remake of a classic film. Mel Gibson brought us something that as uncomfortable as it was, it was an incredible film, the acting, the make up, the sets, the story, the language, everything in this film is just makes it's mark and exceeds at what it's moral is: courage and strength.",/review/rw4340189/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2020,From93tillInfinity,8," I am Jaguar Paw. This is my forest!
","I really don't get some of the comments, rating it one star because it didnt depict true mayans... There are obviously flaws in historical accuracy but who cares? It's a movie.. and it's brilliant. In another multiverse the Mayans probably did human sacrifice. The cinematography in this is outstanding, the acting.. costumes are all so good! There was a subtleness behind this genius screenplay, it didn't try to hard on the plot. One of my all time favourites of its kind!",/review/rw4340189/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2007,carlostallman,10," The Artist As A Tough/Rough Man
","One of the roughest, toughest art films I've ever seen. Remarkable, sensational. Non a mean task to put aside all the gossip surrounding the man behind this miracle and look at ""Apocalypto"" for what it is : a startling piece of art done by one of the most startling artists of our time. But I was able to do exactly that and sit there open mouthed, totally transported to the world Mel Gibson had in store for me. I don't want to get into any spoilers but let me tell you there are, at least, 4 moments - not merely technical but emotional - that are a first for the movies. There is violence in the film yes, but not nearly as much as in ""Casino Royale"" and definitely more justified. I'll take my wife next time, she stayed home, brainwashed by the avalanche of misinformation claiming it was one of the most violent films ever made. I know my wife well enough to know she will love ""Apocalypto""",/review/rw4340189/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2006,Rick NYC-2,10," A Brilliant Message About Civilization
","Say what you want about Mel Gibson, but he knows how to make an authentically real statement about the human condition. The movie is about civilization and how smaller is better. There are some rain-forest dwelling American natives, somewhere in America where there are jaguars and monkeys. Then there are some ""civilized"" natives, with a huge society of nobles, serfs, slaves and sacrificial victims who get their hearts torn out and heads chopped off on top of a pyramid, for the appeasement of their gods and for the sake of controlling and entertaining the ""citizens."" Our noble small villagers of the forest are ultimately hunted down and enslaved by the more organized, and totally vicious, pyramid builders. This is a story of how one of these villagers deals with the horrific trials that his captors heap upon him. The whole movie is in an ancient native language, subtitled in English, and it lends an air of excruciating authenticity to the happenings. One gets the feeling of being a time traveler, as this 500-year-old world seems so real, with every detail of weaponry, cookware, clothing, jewelry, labor practices, buildings, village characters, and sacrificial ceremonies so obviously researched that it made me feel uncomfortably like I was involved in it all. We are constantly getting the crowd's point of view of all the empire's activities and abuse of its captives and underlings. There is a lot to look at here, from God's beautiful nature to man's nightmarish creations, so it deserves to be seen on a big screen.",/review/rw4340189/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2006,mushbuster,10," Jaguar Paw's Great Adventure
","The reviewers are trying to damn this movie with an untruthful and insincere mantra about its alleged excess of violence: ""brutally violent,"" ""over-the-top violence,"" ""unrelenting violence,"" ""ultraviolent,"" ""The Hills Have Eyes in the jungle,"" ""unpleasant, pointless, gruesome, and exploitative,"" ""pure, amoral sensationalism,"" ""blood and gore  so extreme that they provoke titters of ridicule,"" ""savage cruelty and sadistic barbarity,"" ""lunatic violence,"" ""feverish, mad violence."" You'd think from the reviews that you were going to see two hours of babies being fed through a wood chipper.

15 November 2021,Insane_Man,10," The Family

12 March 2007,Coventry,10," It's the end of the Maya-World as we know it
","If ""Apocalypto"" only taught us ONE thing, it's that Mel Gibson is one of the last truly dedicated and perfectionist filmmakers active in Hollywood these days. In an era where all the other directors revert to digital effects and other computer-engineered toys to re-create even the smallest details in scenery, Gibson actually took the time and effort to rebuild the entire and carefully detailed Maya-metropolis as well as complete tribal villages and contemporary hunting equipment. In other words, this is cinema at his purest! And does it ever work! ""Apocalypto"" is much more realistic and visually overwhelming than any other large-scaled epic production that came out recently. When the protagonists enter the empire of the Maya-priests, it feels like history comes to life in front of your eyes and it's literally breathtaking. The downright brilliant sets and scenery alone cause me to refer to Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" as one of the greatest movies of the year 2006, and then I still haven't mentioned a thing about the story and the acting performances. The screenplay is neatly divided into two main chapters and, it has to be said, the first half isn't that impressive. Entirely filmed in the gigantic Mexican rain forest, Gibson introduces us to the members of a small native community and extendedly portrays how they live, hunt and celebrate in harmony. The men supply the village with food while the women are exclusively occupied with giving birth to new descendants and looking after the children. Their peaceful lives abruptly come to end when the warriors of another Maya-tribe savagely invade the village. The adult men and women are enslaved and taken for an exhausting journey across the jungle, while the children are abandoned at a river. Jaguar Paw manages to entrench his pregnant wife and son in a pit and promises them to return. Arriving in the aforementioned metropolis, the majority of villagers are sacrificed to the Sun Gods, but Jaguar Paw miraculously escapes this merciless fate. Then for the second half, Mel Gibson turns his script around into a tremendously entertaining B-popcorn movie with the most amazingly choreographed and adrenalin-rushing jungle chase ever depicted. Relentlessly pursued by a handful of bloodthirsty Maya-warriors, Jaguar Paw runs home through the jungle like crazy and defeats his enemies one by one, using his knowledge of the area as well as his trained hunting skills. The first half of ""Apocalypto"" is a visual masterpiece but slightly dull and implausible. According to news articles I've read, the events also aren't illustrated accurately since Mel Gibson uses too many metaphors that refer to nowadays politics and social issues. I can't really judge on that, but it remains an undeniable fact that ""Apocalypto"" is must-see if only for the copious amounts of spectacle and excitement it delivers. This is a much better film than ""Passion of the Christ"" and at least a dozen times less pretentious. Of course, you require a strong stomach and nerve system, as Mel Gibson portrays the physical battles and torture sequences really graphically and without leaving anything to the imagination. This means that, for example, when a wild jaguar attacks someone, it really shows you how the animal devours his whole face, complete with uncanny grinding noises and buckets of bloodshed. The acting performances are more than adequate, especially considering most of the cast members never had cameras aimed at them, and Gibson's direction is constantly resolute. Highly recommended viewing; whether you're a fan of raw exploitation or large-budgeted epics, ""Apocalypto"" is a cinematic experience you can't afford yourself to miss.",/review/rw4340189/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2018,bigdmia,10," Possibly one of the best films ever made
","The effort and attention to detail in the production is evident when you watch the film. Just the authenticity of the film's location, costumes, weaponry and actors is worth the ticket price. Then you watch the rest of the film, and it simply blows you away. Mel Gibson created a masterpiece. The only flaws are the critics who helped in denying him and the film - the accolades that they rightly deserved.",/review/rw4340189/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2007,inlovewithmovies,10," One of the most underrated masterpieces
","I have to respectfully disagree with the reviewer who was trying to minimize the violence of this movie as not more than most action films. The reviewer had asserted that the descriptions of ""brutallay violent,"" ""sadistic barbarity,"" and ""unrelenting violence"" were inaccurate. Well, it's more than that......in fact, I would say that it takes barbarous violence to a whole new level.....but, what would you expect from a movie that is about human sacrifice and village plundering!!! A Disney movie about a Native American, this movie is not! The difference between this movie and say a movie like Saw is that Saw uses needless violence just to titillate audiences, this movie takes you back in time and you shows you what it was like, blood and all. I've always hated movies that go back to a historical event and wimps out by not showing how bloodthirsty and cruel a certain ritual was--somehow trying to sugarcoat the ugly parts of history.",/review/rw4340189/?ref_=tt_urv
