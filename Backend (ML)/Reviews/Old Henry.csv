19 May 2009,MovieAddict2016,6," Competently made, but also self-defeating.
","Considering that he's part of the dreaded ""MTV Generation"" of filmmakers, McG is surprisingly old-school when it comes to his framing: no jumpy Michael Bay antics or hypercutting Paul Greengrass mimicries. He is a far more organic director, letting the action sequences play out naturally. It's his execution that's at fault: the action itself. He piles explosions on top of other explosions and machines slamming into other machines, backed by the deafening cues of Danny Elfman's score, and I'm pretty sure Christian Bale had a yelling stipulation written into his contract. Everything's loud, intense, bombastic. You can't accuse McG of copying Jim Cameron's first two flicks — or even Jonathan Mostow's goofy third — but you're left wishing he'd perfected his own style before tackling such an ambitious project and producing, as a result, a frustratingly passable action-thriller.",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2021,sauravjoshi85,7," The movie might not be great but still watchable and will entertain
","Terminator Salvation is a Sci-fi action movie directed by McG and stars Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Late Anton Yelchin, Moon Bloodgood, Bryce Dallas Howard, Common, Jadagrace Berry and Helena Bonham Carter.",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2017,JERICH9478,7," Stop expecting the greatness of T2......Better then T3 and Genisys
",Terminator Salvation gets panned left and right.....but let me first say this is way more better then T3 and Genisys by miles.,/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2015,frequenzangriff,8," A really good sci fi movie
","I've seen it three times - in the big screen (2009), somewhen in 2012, and now at 2015 (after seeing genesys) I also really don't understand all the negative comments about this film. I am a fan of the Terminator series (t1, t2 and TV show) and i really think this film stays true to the original idea and actually adds quite a bit to it.",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2009,FiendishDramaturgy,8," I liked it better than I expected, and was far less disappointed in comparison than other fans seem to have been.
","Wow, where do we start with a franchise film so rich in history...and so riddled with continuity errors? The time line problems began with the very first sequel, directed by Cameron himself, and perpetuated with T3. why then, is everyone so freaked by time line errors in T4? Depending on which line to which you subscribe, T4 still deviates vastly from BOTH sequels and begins a new alternative reality spin all its own.",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2017,michaelRokeefe,8," John Connor, its up to you!
",Gritty installment four of the Terminator series. It is post-apocalyptic 2018 and John Connor (Christian Bale) is called on to lead the resistance against a dominating militaristic world of robots. Thought provoking elements help overlook some story line weakness. Altogether very entertaining and well directed. Terminator fans and even those who know very little of the series' backstory will enjoy this action-packed film.,/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2009,siderite,7," This was actually a decent film!
","Enough with the copycat comments! Everybody is so keen to criticize this film, while completely ignoring its good parts. Was there some plot weirdness? Well, yeah, we are talking humans winning versus machines here. But most of it was decent.",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2018,xenazues,7," The 80's and the 90's aren't coming back.
","I have seen a lot of reviews on here, more than I usually read. And it is way too many 1's. This movie is no where near a one rating. I've been watching a lot of movies since I was a little kid. From cheesy 80's flicks, to straight to TV. This is no where near a 1. This movie sits at a 7 for me. Would have got an 8 but I'm super hard on the female acting in these new generation of movies.",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2015,Tyson14,7," A dark and gritty view of the future
","I had doubts about this film when it was released but despite all the negative feedback that it has received, I really liked it.",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2018,smithjackson-44445,," Terminator Salvation is a great sequel to T1 and T2
","Wow, this is a decent film- I was thoroughly entertained and this despite going in with low expectations. McG manages a great color palette and the action sequences are awesome. Sure, this isn't as great as The Terminator or Terminator 2 but it is surely better than T3 and a lot better than the other works in the cannon. Both Bale and Worthington are fantastic. Go watch Terminator salvation now.",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2020,reddiemurf81,8," This is right along the lines of what I wanted to see,,,

9 June 2015,geminiredblue,9," I'll Be Back... Now in the Future!!!
","The first three TERMINATOR movies were all time-traveling capers in their respective eras of 1984, 1997, and 2003. Here, finally, in TERMINATOR SALVATION, we get to see the war between man and machine in the dusty post-apocalyptic year of 2018. John Connor (Christian Bale) is a soldier in the human resistance movement. Not yet the leader, he inevitably takes it upon himself to track down a very young Kyle Reese (the late great Anton Yelchin), who will one day turn out to be his father. Meanwhile, a mysterious man (Sam Worthington) wakes up in an underground facility that the resistance fighters come across. Traveling through the barren wasteland, he soon learns of his origins and purpose. Admittedly, the plot is virtually a shoestring, keeping the events loosely tied together. But that's fine, because the real strong points are the spectacular and epic battles on display here. And yes, fans of the series, Arnold Schwarzenegger DOES make an appearance in this film. While some have felt that this movie was a let-down, I disagree. In fact, this is the movie that TERMINATOR 3 should've been!",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2021,aheaven2005,7," Fair action movie
","Once you manage to settle back in the series timeline, the movie is actually a fair dystopian action entertainment. Bale offers a strange grunting Connor, but it actually works in the end.",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,Xstal,6," Terminal Overload...
","The dystopian future anticipated, machines rule the roost as has been fated, but a rogue seems to slip, through the metallic grip, and things seem a little less automated.",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2020,beornmatt,7," I don't understand why people dislike this so much
","This movie has a...um...different ending? Yeah, it's different but despite all that I really don't get all the hate. It's an enjoyable action flick that builds on the Terminator franchise in a satisfying way. I dig it.",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2015,zardoz-13,9," Slam Bang Actioneer with Christian Bale As John Connor
","The fourth entry in the ""Terminator"" franchise ""Terminator Salvation"" doesn't topline Arnold Schwarzenegger. The legendary Austrian bodybuilder appears strictly as a CGI character in a cameo as he looked in James Cameron's original ""Terminator,"" and he doesn't utter any of his signature lines of dialogue. Despite the absence of Arnold, this superbly produced epic qualifies as excellent in every respect, and McG stages everything with the word spectacular in mind. Skynet deploys its devastating Hunter-Killer helicopters that possess vertical engines like a Harrier Jump Jet. The T-101 terminators appear by the scores, and Skynet has a gigantic exoskeleton robot with a mini-Vulcan cannon mounted atop its towering physique. Furthermore, they have water creatures that resemble spines with pincers for mouths. The Resistance counters these forces with A-10 attack jets, and they maintain their headquarters aboard a submarine at sea so as to elude detection by Skynet. This larger-than-life tale initially transpires in the wastelands and then the action moves to Skynet headquarters. Iconically , one of the important things that this movie does is show us how Connor acquired his distinctive facial scar. ",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2009,jora_dyn,7," Enjoyable ride, not quite there but lots of fun...
",I was actually rather surprised that this film was as enjoyable as it was. After reading several scathing reviews I was very worried going into this film. Overall I had a good time watching it.,/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2009,enjoiskaterguy,6," Some nice action but where's the tone? Where's the mood? Where's the atmosphere?
","The atmosphere that James Cameron and Stan Winston had created for the first 2 films in the franchise is what really hit me and still does to this day. I think that was the key component along with consistency and approach that gave the Terminator film it's unique style and attractiveness. It's metallic-blue overlay, infused with creepy whines of music and heart pounding edge of your seat suspense was what really created this secondary reality if not for only an hour long. It made us have a connection to these characters. A sense of believability in what was really going on. But it was those elements that were able to harness the inner workings of this dark dreamland. In essence the first two Terminators were projected nightmares in a sense, as if you were running and running, but no how fast you ran, the shadowy figure on your toes just keeps closing in. THAT is what made those films so captivating.",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2021,JoelChamp85,8," War Torn Future
","The more action based film of the franchise. Good cast and the Terminator designs are really cool and mean looking. The FX have been kicked up a notch, finally allowing us into the war torn future.",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2009,Flagrant-Baronessa,3," A sad casualty of what's mistakenly deemed bankable today.
","Yikes. This is definitely not the future my mother warned me about. This future is populated by cute kids, blood-free deaths, supermodels with perfect teeth and goofball terminators that shoot themselves in the foot. It is set in a sun-kissed Michael Bay desert landscape with high-tech military equipment and not the dirty sewers we saw in T1. Either Kyle Reese was laying it on real thick to get in Sarah Connor's pants, or McG et al were simply incapable of delivering the dark, post-apocalyptic future setting that they kept harping on about honoring before release.",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,8," Surprisingly good, this was unexpected.
","I detested the last Terminator film, and the third, I found both tedious, but this one was a surprise, I wrongly ignored it, it's action packed, it's incredibly fast paced, and it has a really rather good story, but...... It doesn't feel like Terminator, apologies to those that see the link, but I just didn't get the link at all.",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2009,Smells_Like_Cheese,1," McTerminator
","OK, I've questioned some ratings before, but for the most part I usually just let it go very easily. But I'm curious, how in the world, no, universe, does Terminator Salvation get a rating above 7.0? This was 2 hours of my life that I will never get back and I should've known better when I saw a director who's name is ""McG"" on the screen, James Cameron must be shuddering. This film had so much incredible potential but ended up turning into Action Film 101, I don't even think the title of the movie should have been Salvation, it should have been Terminator: Let's Blow *bleep* Up! The story was so beyond stupid, the effects are way over the top, they also were trying so hard to be liked by the fans that they stole every cool line from the first two terminator films, and what the F was up with Christian Bale bringing his Batman voice back into this movie?! Despite the confusing movie, I'll try to give you a clear enough summary.",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2009,helmutty,7," Not great but massively entertaining.
","I have watched the terminator series, the movies are quite good. Terminator Salvation is the fourth in the series. One thing that disappoints is that there is no main terminator that goes killing humans like in Terminator 2. MCG, the director, did a great job especially creating the gritty and tough world. MCG proves that he can go from comedic action with stunts to loud whizz-bang and gritty action. But his story pretty much stays the same. His movies have always been a mindless thrill ride. That is Terminator Salvation.",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2009,Critomaton,1," Definitely nothing worth yelling at Shane Hurlbut over.

10 December 2009,malibu-7,10," Very well done....
","I was somewhat hesitant to watch this movie. I didn't want it to be too dark and bleak and depressing. I mean, it was somewhat dark, but there was hope at the end. It's not a mindless action movie. It's definitely an action movie - but a good story I thought. Very entertaining! The story was well done. The characters were great - especially Marcus. You felt what he felt. I think this movie deserves higher than a 6.9 - it's current rating (as of 12-9-09). If you're a fan of Terminator and T-2 - then see this. I did see T3 but was not impressed w/ it and cannot remember much about it (when something doesn't leave an impression, it's usually not that good) - in my humble opinion. I dunno - maybe I need to see it again. I really like Marcus in this movie. I won't give anything away - no spoiler here. Just watch this - you should like it. :-)",/review/rw2171507/?ref_=tt_urv
