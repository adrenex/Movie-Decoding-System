12 June 2018,hrkepler,7," Coherent sci-fi ride
","'Coherence' is master example of what you can achieve with close to no budget, but enough inventiveness. Shot over five days with almost unknown cast (except maybe Nicholas Brendon from 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer') and mostly improvised scenes and dialogue. The writers (director James Ward Byrkit and Alex Manugian who also played the role of Amir) had only written just story and established rules while most of the witty dialogue were improvised by actors themselves, thus proving that the film doesn't need some superstars, but rather talented ensemble cast. Although the hand-held camera-work might seem to take viewer out of the story, it was just another way to give more room to the improvisation. Despite all of that the film manages to keep an eerie atmosphere, and the story movies on one continuous flow without getting sidetracked. The story also doesn't crumble into pieces under it's own ambitions. The twists hold together and actually makes sense. Although the final twist might seem to be rushed and thrown into there just for the sake of it, but it kinda fits and doesn't change the film's overall tone.",/review/rw3068094/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2015,bob the moo,," The low budget shows in some aspects, but generally it is tense, engaging, and satisfying in its delivery
","A group of friends in LA come together for a dinner party on the same night as a comet is going to be passing close to Earth. Warned of potentially odd events, the group is bemused by the loss of phone signals, and the occasional cracked handset, but a little more freaked out by the loss of power to pretty much the entire neighborhood. One of the group, Hugh, has a brother who works in the field of astrophysics and had suggested weirdness may occur – so Hugh and Amir head out to the only house in the area they can see with power, hoping to find a working telephone to contact him on. However, while they are out, other weirdness starts to occur.",/review/rw3068094/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2014,kosmasp,9," Talk a lot
","It's the talk a lot movie. Something that might be distracting and annoying to some, but does feel real. Which is a major ingredient in a ""far out"" story/movie such as this one is. It gets very tricky from one point on, but I do believe it's still easy to follow and understand. We have a group of people, whom we ""dine"" with (not sure you could say we really learn much about them, but it's sufficient to get the story going and the tension flowing).",/review/rw3068094/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2013,outdoorcats,," Low-budget science-fiction deserves attention for its wit and energy
","A mind-bending and very entertaining independent science-fiction film, Coherence takes place over a single night in which a group of old friends (an ex-lovers) gather for a party on a night when a comet is expected to pass unusually close to the Earth. One of which is played by Nicholas Brendon of Buffy the Vampire Slayer in a scene-stealing role. I missed him.",/review/rw3068094/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film deserves all ten stars, mostly because it's a legitimate and creative exploration of the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum foundations. It does so brilliantly, in my opinion, and from the very beginning. (Note : I would watch this without being spoiled, which I am about to do.)",/review/rw3068094/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2018,StuOz,," Twilight Zone Did It Better But This Is Okay
","The arrival of a comet sends a group of people into The Twilight Zone, 2013-style.
 
A good film but a few minutes into it I was saying: ""okay this is a re-make of 1959 Twilight Zone's The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street"". This created a bit of a problem as I was comparing the two productions all the time. Another little issue was that I just did not like the characters in the house. And no, this review is not coming from some 25 year fan boy who can't connect with older people, I am middle aged.",/review/rw3068094/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2014,standsomething2,8," Surprisingly good
","Although the trailer peeked my interest, I didn't go into this movie with high expectations, being that it is a low budget film with actors you don't see to much. But I couldn't have been more wrong.",/review/rw3068094/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2014,dwaynemayo60,8," good cerebral sci-fi
",Great cerebral sci-fi. If you're looking for aliens and spaceships this ain't it but if you like the twilight zone kinda stuff this is a good one. Maybe I was in the right mood for it but I really enjoyed this one. The characters were believable and what I thought were holes in the plot turned out not to be. not sure I would have been thrilled to see it in a movie theater at present ticket and snack prices but a good rental. Gotta pay attention and don't worry if you can't catch everything being said in the first part as it's just party chatter.,/review/rw3068094/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2020,christopher-underwood,9," has you thinking and worrying all the time
","Absolutely loved this. Now I can't pretend that I followed all the science here but it is possible that with as little understanding as I of Quantum Mechanics and the theory of Schrodinger's Cat, actually helps. It was certainly goosebumps and shivers down the spine for me throughout this as a seemingly ordinary set of well off folks try to settle into a dinner party, as a comet passes by. No major stars here and apparently much improvised dialogue within what is essentially a single set and yet this is so involving and scary. Hard to say too much without it spoiling the experience for others but, as far as I am concerned, something really different and stimulating that has you thinking and worrying all the time.",/review/rw3068094/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2021,cmantafounis,9," Coherence
","Second watch, and *wow*. Can easily say this would be among my favourite films released in 2013, making it the fourth sci-fi movie in the top five (alongside Her, Under the Skin, and Upstream Colour - the exception being Inside Llewyn Davis). Its greatest trick is fooling the audience into believing that there are only two houses for at least an hour, until Hugh shows up with a different plaster and we realise all previous assumptions made were false. (At around 45 minutes, the first hint is made when Beth asks Lee where she got the vase in the kitchen from, seemingly for the second time that night - Emily's reaction shows she picks up on this, formulating the ""roulette wheel"" theory.) As such, the Schrödinger explanation felt less pandering and expository this time around, once you realise that the proposition is wrong (or, at least, not all-encompassing): the decoherence has not resulted in just two states, dead or alive, but a whole multiverse of infinite possibilities. Like the attempt to explain the events as a drug-induced mass hallucination, this is just a theory - which is what makes this so entertaining on first watch, as we are more or less on the same level of understanding as the characters throughout; on subsequent viewings, these theories can be dismissed and one can instead marvel at the ingenuity of the script, which allows three or four different versions of our protagonists to be on screen before we even realise there are any more than two.",/review/rw3068094/?ref_=tt_urv

19 August 2014,planktonrules,3," Destroyed by the camera-work.
","When ""Coherence"" debuted this summer, it earned very, very little money. So far, since its release in June, this independent film has earned less than $69,000. So it's very, very likely a film you haven't yet seen. As for me, I am actually very thankful I didn't see it in the theater-- and it's for a reason you might not anticipate. It's not because the plot is bad (it's kind of interesting actually) but because the film has horrendous camera-work. I assume that the camera-work is supposed to be hip or exciting--but to me it is nausea-evoking and if I'd seen it on the big screen, I probably would have gotten a headache or begun vomiting. This is because the entire movie has a hand-held camera look and the picture almost never stays still. It almost always bounces around and won't stay on any one object. Now this might work for a very limited number of films--such as a 'found footage' film like The Blair Witch Project. So why, then, does the camera keep moving with a film like Coherence? And, why are some of the edits (particularly early in the film) so seemingly random and some shots out of focus? If you see it, you might just want to take a few Dramamine in order to cope with the camera's movement--which I expect with home movies but not with a film lasting nearly 90 minutes. Can the movie itself manage to overcome this annoying camera-work and make it all worthwhile?",/review/rw3068094/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2017,AndreaBeaumont,10," movie we saw is just a single frame of the larger story
","It is clearly shown that Laurie and Mike have no recollection of each other, as if they haven't met before. A director's clue is almost explicit in line ""I guess it must be another girl that Kevin dated and Amir is hooking up with"". Besides, it is stated the technology failures occurred during the day of the dinner party, the comet was affecting the world throughout some time.",/review/rw3068094/?ref_=tt_urv

","COHERENCE is a very interesting premise, but the execution felt pretentious. I get it, in real life, people actually do talk all over each other and interrupt each other, but did the writers and actors have to to it to THIS extent? Half the time, I couldn't make out what the hell characters were saying or talking about! I couldn't get over the fact at how CALMLY this group of people just took the news that they were in an infinite dimension. There was no one freaking out, there was no one saying that it was nonsense, no one saying that this must be some sort of joke. The actors played the parts way too self-aware. Speaking of, the acting was pretty much the same across the board. None of the characters felt unique. Every character was just a generic, middle-class, wine-drinking, yoga-class-talking yuppie. And the camera-shaking was too much. The ending is where this thing gets even remotely engaging, but by then it's way too late. Better talent could have made this futile exercise actually...COHERENT!",/review/rw3068094/?ref_=tt_urv

",I've watched this twice in 5 years. It's as natural as they come in the way the actors interact with each other. The camera work is reminiscent of NYPD Blue and something I particularly like. Some actors excel at being allowed to act and not follow a rigid script and they do this well. The coherence/decoherence is well thought out and works well.

","The movie is an interesting watch. It leaves you with the question of what if something like this actually happened to us. We are so caught up in our world and seeing ourself through a different eye is something else. It's an impressive work considering it's low budget and use of improvisation.

31 December 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,5," Meh, I wasn't buying what they were selling.
","Not sure why all the high praise for this film, it's just another Twilight Zone episode done many times before, and better. The directing and camera work was horrendous, and the constant annoying shaky-cam and zoom-ins became unbearable 20 mins into the film. You can't get any more amateur-hour than that type of annoying filmmaking. The pacing was slow, and every scene was milked to the max with lots of uninteresting incoherent jargon, that the normally comfortable 89 min runtime felt endless. The narrative felt more like a side-show magic trick shown over and over again, but from different viewpoints. All the trickery just wasn't impressive enough. The cast performances mostly felt forced an unauthentic, probably from newb filmmaker James Ward Byrkit's inexperience to direct his cast effectively. This film may have worked better as a short, but there just wasn't enough substance in the convoluted narrative to keep the viewer engaged throughout the entire runtime.",/review/rw3068094/?ref_=tt_urv
