11 February 2022,louis1011,7," Simple but very clever
",This film has a great main character but the situations she's put in are what truly make this film what it is. You'll be on the edge of your seat for almost the entire film because the stakes are so high while still feeling realistic. Although the religious aspects of this film worked for the most part it did border on preachy on occasion.,/review/rw7864041/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," A very impressive low budget Indie film written by an amateur.
","There's nothing really unique about this film for it's genre, but wow did director D. J. Caruso nail it with his excellent camera work in his shots, angles and color choices in the cinematography. He directed his cast perfectly, as every single performance - including the adorable little girl(s), was perfect. The stunning Rainey Qualley played the role of a struggling and recovered single mom still facing issues with her abusive ex, with utter perfection. You really felt her pain, struggles and desperation. Amateur writer Melanie Toast gave us (her first ever) near-flawless screenplay, with pretty much zero plot issues. Although I'm not a fan of slow paced films, this one had the pacing just right for the comfortable and well-used 89 min runtime. She is definitely a writer to watch out for. Sure there could've been maybe a bit more action, guts and gore, but then this would be a cliched film. The story was just right and original in its own way to keep the viewer in awe at the realism and possibility of every event in this film to happen to any ordinary person in this type of situation. Even the score was spot on, and the fact everything was so great in a clearly low budget film, makes Shut In even that much more impressive. I'm baffled at some of the wannabe reviewers and their low scores. This is pretty much a flawless film that will leave you silent and thinking for a long time after watching it. A most certain recommend - I'll be watching it again for sure, and a well deserved 9/10 for the entire cast and crew giving us this suspenseful and entertaining little gem. You have my applause and standing ovation, ladies and gentlemen.",/review/rw7864041/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2022,ArtShouldAvoidPolitics,9," Gripping
","Hollywood has done a good job in setting my bar so low that any movie that does not preach - i love. Not only Shut In does not preach, but it is a very gripping movie in itself. Could have released this in theaters and made some good money.",/review/rw7864041/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2022,JICNZ,8," Fantastic
","I loved the message behind this movie, the analogy of the rotten apples. It's present throughout, but becomes clear at the very end. These new Daily Wire movies aren't Hallmark, if that's your taste. They are incredibly gritty, often violent, and extremely intense at times. But they are also amazingly strong, pure and thought provoking.",/review/rw7864041/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2022,sidfargas,," Really Good - I'm Stunned
",Don't listen to the haters who have clearly not seen this movie and still gave it a rating. I saw it and I'm actually quite surprised at the high quality of the production value. The entire cast but especially the lead was outstanding. I'm talking award-worthy. Everything is intense and every scene is riveting. The third act was genuinely surprising as was the entire film. I highly recommend this endeavor.,/review/rw7864041/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2022,octagonproplex,7," Perfect Entertainment For Shuttin In With
","Following fine genre efforts such as ""Disturbia"", ""Taking Lives"" and ""The Saltom Sea"" - D. J. Caruso has directed a taught contained psychological thriller of enthralling rising tension and refreshingly streamlined machanics about the fierce sacredness of motherhood. Featuring an interesting lead character arriving on the scene with plenty of existential baggage as brought to nuanced life by the stunning Rainey Qualley who reveals a true screen presence. Competently proving her place in a family of accomplished actresses (her mother is Andie MacDowell or ""Greystoke"", ""Green Card"" and ""Groundhog Day"" fame, while her sister is Margaret Qualley most notable for her memorable appearance in Quentin Tarantino's ""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood"").",/review/rw7864041/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2022,mrobertson-24538,8," Good, edge-of-your-seat move.
","I really enjoyed this movie. I was half expecting cheesy scenes with a recovering addict suddenly becoming the mother of the year, but there was none of that. Jessica is portrayed as trying to figure out how to be a good mother, and sometimes makes mistakes. This is a gritty and sometimes violent movie that I think realistically portrayed the characters. There were interesting twists, scary moments, infuriating moments, and a good payoff at the end. It keeps you engaged all the way through.",/review/rw7864041/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2022,Celesteacole,8," For an indie film, it's really good
","There are a few things I would have changed in the movie, only because the reaction from the character didn't particularly make sense in certain scenes. There were some good intense moments, and pretty good acting (especially from the little girl. She did so well!). Overall I definitely enjoyed it.",/review/rw7864041/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2022,jcq101,2," Terrible
","Terrible plot, terrible flow, just awful. A meth addict, a child molester and a useless excuse for a mother. The lead character is incapable of making anything resembling a good choice. She can't even kick through an old door.",/review/rw7864041/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2022,Snakeskinzjr,6," what's with all the 10's?
","Way too many 10 star ratings from people who have only reviewed this one title, yeah real believable. It wasn't bad and it wasn't great , the acting was good it was a decent thriller. I thought the lead actress did a good job, for me the fact she acted so helpless in the locked pantry was not very believable , if you look around in there she could have easily kicked those shelves apart and used the boards for tools, or how about using the brick to bust through the lath and plaster wall? No she spent hours digging through the floor with a screwdriver. It was entertaining but not very memorable. I hope Daily Wire steps up there game next time around.",/review/rw7864041/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2022,philvickiw,8," Revenge and Redemption
","Daily Wire comes out swinging with their first original movie Shut In. Director DJ Caruso; Eagle Eye, Disturbia, takes this psychological thriller to the edge and back. Only one location, mostly a locked pantry, and only 5 actors and a baby, mostly the unloveable mother Jessica; Rainey Qualley, dominate this film. From the start we are hard pressed to feel empathy with this down on her luck mother of two trying to make good for her children and still making mistakes. But we soon rally behind her as life has backed her into a corner and she is ready to fight. Rainey Qualley's performance is strong, memorizing and down right believable. The movie keeps a steady pace, intense at times, with some scenes of violence, drug use and language that gets its TV mature rating. Gone are the Hollywood undertones and the simple truth of a woman seeking revenge and redemption.",/review/rw7864041/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2022,brentn,4," Not the DJ Caruso I remember.
","Salton Sea, Disturbia, Taking Lives, now these were top notch, engaging films. Shut In is more like I Am Number Four or xXx 3. Just lackluster filming at its finest. The Protagonist (Qualley) is a recovering addict who gets locked into a pantry when her 2 psycho addict friends pay a visit leaving her 2 children at their mercy. The film is set up to be an escape thriller even though the title seems to infer that she is more of an agoraphobe or shy, sheltered introvert that has to fend for herself. There is nothing wrong with having a simple plot but the other aspects need to reflect this and make up for the lack of story. There is little character development, the atmosphere is lazy and not as brooding or dark as it should be and there is no intrigue. The main character shows little ingenuity when trying to escape and no twists and turns for the story to progress. The villains are barely there and are not even close to being as menacing as they could have been save for Sammy (Vincent Gallo). He plays an excellent creep but is not used enough. Overall this film is just a snooze fest it's basically just a matter of time before she gets out and waiting for her to get there is boring drivel. Watch Panic Room, Devil, Escape Room, Split, Crawl or even See For Me which came out recently. 4/10.",/review/rw7864041/?ref_=tt_urv
