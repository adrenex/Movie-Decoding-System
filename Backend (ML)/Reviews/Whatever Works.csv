20 March 2010,lewiskendell,7," Where's the nearest train to India?
","The Darjeeling Limited is certainly a visually appealing movie. The rich colors of southeast Asia mesh wonderfully with Anderson's penchant for precise set-pieces, and it make the entire experience a pleasure to watch. ",/review/rw1769920/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Darjeeling Limited is a metaphor-laden ride in which the characters all have baggage, both literal and figurative, that they cannot seem to shed because they have yet to understand that they would be less encumbered without it.",/review/rw1769920/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2007,pyrocitor,9," Anderson hits it big with offbeat, quietly affecting effort
","Given the trademark quirkiness yet insight into many profound truths of human behaviour one would expect from director Wes Anderson, it should come as no surprise that his latest film, The Darjeeling Limited, demonstrates the majority of these traits with particular flair and distinction, arguably Anderson's strongest work to date.

14 October 2007,dead47548,8," More spiritual. More guided. Same Anderson.
","When deciding whether or not to see this film, the question is very simple: Do you like Wes Anderson's previous work? If you answered yes to this question, you will adore The Darjeeling Limited. If you answered no, you'd better spend your money elsewhere. I personally, fall very deeply into the former category. I've always been a huge Anderson fan and adore all four of his previous efforts, and this certainly ranks among his best (top three, easily). This is a much more guided, inspirational and personal work from the man. While his other features have been more minimalistic and set between a certain group of characters, Darjeeling takes on a much larger world.",/review/rw1769920/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2008,ametaphysicalshark,," A complex and beautiful film
","After three viewings of ""The Darjeeling Limited"" I find myself quite certain that this is not Wes Anderson's best film in the sense that it's not his best-paced film and it may have some moments that are a little too heavy-handed. However, I find that these little flaws add to the charm of the film because of the way it is constructed and written. It almost feels like one is part of the journey and since no journey of this sort is perfect or fully enjoyable it's almost fitting that this film isn't",/review/rw1769920/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2007,ozdavidson,8," Nobody said his movies weren't difficult at times.
","This is a film occupied with moments. Wonderful moments. It is not so much concerned with mechanics of plot but for me, it never got dull. Wes Anderson has matured in subtle ways and this film is a well crafted blend of the personal and the pageantry - Powell and Pressburger and Cassavetes. ""The Rules of the Game"" and ""Husbands."" ""The Last Detail"" and ""The River.""",/review/rw1769920/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2019,grantss,6," Starts very well but second half is disappointing
","I am a fan of Wes Anderson's movies. I liked all his previous offerings: Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Rushmore, in particular, was superb. All had a similar structure: character-driven, rather than plot-driven, dramas with moments of offbeat comedy and quaint bitter-sweet pictures of everyday people and the ups and downs of their lives.",/review/rw1769920/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2007,xander34,7," Wes doing Wes
","The Darjeeling Limited is unlike the average comedy. While not being truly laugh out loud funny, the film is clever, well written, with memorable characters and one liners that grow wittier over time. The only type of movie it can be compared to are other films by Wes Anderson, the director of Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and the love it or hate film, The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou. All of his movies are extremely stylized, with slow motion sequences, wide lenses that slightly distort the frame, and privileged, depressed characters with family issues all thrown together in a slightly artificial, timeless, carefully detailed environment. While with The Life Aquatic he may have tried to do too much, The Darjeeling Limited shows Anderson finally perfected his style. He knows when to throw inside jokes to his most loyal of fans, while keeping his stories fresh and personal, without acknowledging the critics who blame Anderson for repeating himself.",/review/rw1769920/?ref_=tt_urv

29 September 2007,Chris Knipp,9," Saying yes to everything, or trying to anyway
","The first thing to note about Wes Anderson's new film (featuring Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, and Adrien Brody, as the Whitman brothers, Francis, Jack, and Peter respectively) is that it was shot in India, mostly on a colorful old train traveling across Rajasthan. The train perhaps replaces the elaborate constructed set of the ship Anderson used in 'The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.' That ship was a bit of an albatross. The movie cost $60 million to make and is Anderson's least admired work. The train is part of a faster and cheaper production and it's crucially different: it's a real train, in motion during the shoot. It's still perhaps an arbitrary and whimsical setand has the kind of bright pastel colors Anderson likesbut this time, as Brody has said about the shoot, they were learning to ""live in the moment,"" just letting things happen, and using whatever they observed of Indian life as elements in the film. Every time they turned around there was something unfamiliar, remarkable and new to see; if they could, they worked it in. This isn't navel-gazing (though there's that) but also discovery and wonderment. It's partly a homage to Anderson's fascination with India and admiration for Jean Renoir's 'The River' and the films of Satyajit Ray. The soundtrack isn't just sweet Seventies rock but music from Ray's classics.",/review/rw1769920/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2008,snow0r,9," Wes Anderson delivers. Again...

4 January 2020,UniqueParticle,9," Wonderful forgotten gem
","A lovely electrifying journey of 3 friends that is beautifully done, incredible acting and artsy style to everything! Wes Anderson has such a magic touch of glorious vision; masterful cinema unlike anything else! Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, and Jason Shcwartsman are captivating probably their best roles. Also I absolutely love the line ""Can we agree to that?"".",/review/rw1769920/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2009,cherold,4," Well, that was a huge waste of time
","In terms of Wes Anderson, I thought the Royal Tenenbaums was great and Rushmore and Life Aquatic were at least intriguing, but The Darjeeling Limited is a pointless, shapeless thing that sucked up and hour and a half of my life and left me with nothing. It's never terrible. The acting is good, it's a nice looking movie and it works very well and an India travelogue, but it just seems so utterly pointless. The characters aren't especially interesting or compelling and the plot is just a bunch of stuff loosely strung together. I was tempted to give up on this movie an hour in but I wound up sticking with it to the end, which I regret. The best I can say for it is, it's short.",/review/rw1769920/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2007,paul2001sw-1,4," Trying hard for unreality
","I must admit to having trouble in appreciating the films of Wes Anderson It's not that I don't like ""quirky"": it's just that his movies appear to be so self-consciously quirky that they don't feel as if they have anything to say about real life. 'The Darjeeling Limited' is about a trio of American brothers who travel to India on a personal quest, but it's a film that say's nothing of relevance about either America or modern day India; Anderson even seems to be admitting this himself when, for example, he has a ticket clerk on India railways speaking in a perfect American accent - is this genuinely quirky, or just an admission that the film is distinctive only through including what we have good reason not to expect? Owen Wilson plays much the same role he played in 'Bottle Rocket'; the usually great Aidrien Brody is wasted. Of course, there are funny moments, but there's the overwhelming feeling here of a film that's trying far too hard not to be real. A movie this daft needs to be funnier, instead, it feels like the work of a film-maker too much in love with himself.",/review/rw1769920/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2008,Ozzy2000,1," Snotty little film
","After their very wealthy father of the Whitman family dies three very wealthy brothers set off to India to find their wealthy self-indulgent mother who is undergoing some mental catharsis guilt trip by acting as a nun in a Quasi Christian temple in India. On this journey through India, these three brothers attempt to also attain some spirituality by undergoing ridiculous made up spiritual rituals. The film actually begins with this meaningless episode of Jack Whitman, played by Jason Schwartzman, staying in an upmarket French hotel and having a reunion with his girlfriend played by Natalie Portman. There is a very gratuitous naked scene of Natalie Portman (More for the benefit of the Coppola family she obliges) and that just about ends her contribution to the film except for two seconds at the end. Bill Murray and Angelica Huston also make cameo appearances. The contrast between the three brothers and the absolute poverty of India is brushed over by some stupid interaction in the saving of a child's life and the funeral of one that tragically dies. There is a simplistic attempt at symbolism in the act of unloading luggage.",/review/rw1769920/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2008,diane-34,5," Not a very good film.
","99.9% of the time I do not like to comment about films I have seen that I do not like; however, this weird film is the exception that proves the proverbial rule. Dargeeling was not so much a bad film, meaning the production qualities were poor, as a film that should just have missed being given financial backing.",/review/rw1769920/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is really a stinker. Everything is good about it except the characters and the writing. It has high production values, the acting is very good, but the characters are shallow, narcissistic and nothing more than sum of their hangups. It's like some teenage film school freshman was given unlimited resources to try to create the most quirky characters ever, without a story to hang it on. Perhaps it's how a spoiled, rich teenager would imagine adults to be, selfish, whiny, demanding and spiritually hollow. ",/review/rw1769920/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2010,ivangohome,10," severely under-accredited
","If you watch it carefully from the beginning with no preconception or bias the movie has immense subliminal humour and relaxation effect. It puts you in a pleasant stoned-like state if you watch it on a Friday after a hearty dinner:) Of all the movies I've seen this one doest it for me. You feel like buying a ticket - and going on a trip of your own. I do not like most of the actors but they have natural humour and played so brilliantly that I forgot the gripe. The movie does not force a sense of anything - you listen to the sounds of nature, the rural and the industrial landscape. The soundtrack is perfect. The 3 main characters are not successful or content with their lives yet they are forced to go on a ""spiritual"" journey because they once agreed to it (brothers). I imagine it is hard to market a situational comedy these days a la Wes Anderson, Cohen brothers, Jim Jarmusch with so many fast-paced bubblegum-plot flicks spewed by the industry. This plot would sound stupid if I hadn't known a family that did the same back when I was a kid.",/review/rw1769920/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2008,witster18,5," definitely NOT Wes Anderson's best.
","I have really enjoyed the directors' previous work. The Darjeeling Lmtd does bring some of the same, strong characteristics of his previous films... good music... great color... interesting characters... where this one falls short, is on the comedy-meter. It's just not as funny, nor is this one as inventive with it's editing or as upscale in it's production/editing value. I enjoyed Life Aquatic...and loved Rushmore...but this one, quite honestly, bored me. I really struggled to get through it. Sure, it has it's quirky, funny moments.. ...but the story is just too slow moving and doesn't have near the energy of his other films. It's kind of stagnant. I REALLY wanted to like this... i was really looking forward to it... but I can't give it a recommendation and I'm a little surprised at it's score here. I'm sure some fans will disagree, but I think this is carved at the bottom of the Wes Anderson totem pole. Where I can see some Wes Anderson fans enjoying this... those who haven't liked his previous work, or have been split, will absolutely hate it. 52/100",/review/rw1769920/?ref_=tt_urv

","Following a troika of greats with ""Rushmore"", ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"", Wes Anderson extended it with ""The Darjeeling Limited"". This one has brothers Peter (Adrien Brody), Jack (Jason Schwartzman) and Francis (Owen Wilson) traveling together on a train through India for a ""spiritual journey"". The dysfunctional family is clearly Wes Anderson's specialty, and he doesn't disappoint. Especially impressive is the scene showing the brothers before the trip to India (I liked how the scene throws the audience off).",/review/rw1769920/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2007,Sergeant_Tibbs,10," An experience to share, ""The Darjeeling Limited"" is the director's and year's finest feature yet!
","Wes Anderson's fifth film is not only his best but one of the most perfect film experiences I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. The film had me absolutely captivated throughout its entire running time. I found it impossible to divert my attention or find a flaw. An enlightening and refreshing piece of work. Anderson dips into similar themes like in his previous ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" of family and loyalty; reuniting them and having his characters fix their loose ends. And again, like the others, one of the characters tries to repair it with a plan, a journey. It features his pleasant ironic humour, flawless choices of mood music and extraordinary art direction. He is a required taste, that I, of course, boast. And I now have the incapability to get it out of my head.",/review/rw1769920/?ref_=tt_urv
