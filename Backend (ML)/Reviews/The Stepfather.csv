","Queen of the South is an incredible action and suspense thriller about the rise of a Cartel Queen. It's not a true story so they can do anything they go anywhere they want with the story and there are plenty of twists and turns to keep you captivated. It's a violent, fun drama with great performances by the cast. It's one of the rare drug cartels shows based of a strong female lead. It's a familiar story that's told in a fresh way and will keep you entertained throughout the entire series. It's a show where you shouldn't underestimate anyone and where anything can happen so it will keep you at the edge of your seat. I have to say that this show is so much better than I thought it would be and has only gotten better throughout the seasons.",/review/rw4193765/?ref_=tt_urv

30 June 2016,msva4,9," Better Than the Rating Suggests
","I am honestly very surprised at the low rating for this show. I consider myself a movie and TV snob who completely dislikes the same old same junk from CBS, NBC, and Fox, etc. I love Breaking Bad, Fargo, True Detective, Happy Valley, Sherlock and other quality shows that are similar. This show is no Breaking Bad, but it is enjoyable! For the first 2 episodes I have been pleasantly surprised. Give it a shot! The episodes move quickly and so far, I'm blue at the end that I have to wait another week to see what happens next. The acting is solid, the script is good so far, and if they can keep it up this will be a great show for the long run! I hope it stays around!",/review/rw4193765/?ref_=tt_urv

30 August 2022,grahamf-55542,8," As good as Narcos
",A lot of the negative reviewers speak about plot holes in this series. I didn't notice them. Or maybe the critical writers are getting confused with the holes in the numerous characters who didn't make it through to the end of series 5.,/review/rw4193765/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2022,mgs-15317,10," Brilliant. Just brilliant
",Brilliant acting. Brilliant characters. Humans that most people could relate to. Because at the end of the day if we have lemons we make lemonade. There are different ways to make it but .....there are different ways to go about things and I think that if nothing else this movie allow you to at least consider this concept. And I cannot believe that I have still 237 bloody characters to be able to post this review. I don't have much more to say to be honest except that my advise is to go and watch it and make your own mind about it. And with an open mind you will be able to see more than you thought you would.,/review/rw4193765/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2022,lakings97,8," Enjoyable
","Queen of the South is a USA Network production about a drug cartel run by a fictional woman named Teresa Mendoza played by Alice Braga. Teresa flees Mexico after her boyfriend is murdered and she settles in Dallas and builds her empire to become the biggest drug smuggler to the states. The first few seasons start out strong with Teresa having to fight for her life against Vargas family and takes over the territory. She eventually ends up controlling the southeast corner of the country. The later seasons were less for certain and very well over the top. The cast members over the years included Peter Gadiot, Hemky Madera, Joseph Campos, Joaquin de Almeida, David Andrews, Ryan O'Nan, and Brett Cullen. Overall it was a very entertaining series and unlike most cartel movies, this series does not end on a bad note. God series, good cast, definitely check it out.",/review/rw4193765/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2022,greenjackle,8," Super great show
","This show is great. As far as the drug shows go like Ozark, Breaking Bad, Good Girls, Weeds, Son's of Anarchy, Peaky Blinders, it's up their as a top one. Lots of guns and shooting, so if you don't like that this show isn't for you. However if you can get past that it is a really good show. Lots of twists and turns and they have no problem killing people off. So you never know the ending. But the ending is a very satisfying ending. So 5 seasons to watch and you will know the ending and how to run a cartel.",/review/rw4193765/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2022,flexi_brain,10," Mind blowing! The most engrossing series
","This is not you everyday series on cartels. Honestly, I don't like cartel stories much. But the script, characters, acting and everything that matter is perfect. Most importantly, The ending is such that it will leave you with a peaceful smile. Not only Teresa, every character is quite strong. I think it is quite an underestimated series and much better than the ratings. But, I'd say they have a horrid poster(or whatever you call it).",/review/rw4193765/?ref_=tt_urv

5 April 2021,arod_85,8," Great Show
","I really enjoy this show. It's harsh, violent, realistic and suspenseful. Interesting perspective to have have a female drug smuggler fight her way to the ""top"". Also interesting to see a multi faceted person, a good person doing bad things. A drug lord with a heart. The acting is good and the story lines are also very strong. I also appreciate that the writers seem to know when the story becomes monotonous, so they change it up with new characters and locations. I would agree with some of the other reviewers that think Camilla has run her course as I I'm ready for her to go. This show has some some very interesting and sinister villains, El Santo, the sex trafficker, Deven, and she has been around the longest, yet she's my least favorite. Despite Camilla, I'm really surprised that this is not rated higher on IMDb. One of the best shows on cable.",/review/rw4193765/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2022,hcasale-68303,9," I'm cool with how it ended.
","Unlike a lot of the reviews I've seen, I'm perfectly fine with how the series ended. Kind of reminiscent of the last episode of the Sopranos. You expect a violent conclusion where everyone dies. And exactly the opposite is what happens. That's fine with me. I kept thinking there's no way Teresa is dead, but they dragged it out so it started to look like she was. While unrealistic, I was happy she was alive. I agree the last few minutes seem to veer from the rest of the five seasons. But I'm OK with that. My only disappointment is that George didn't make it. One of the best shows I've seen in years. Anyone who hasn't seen this series, I highly recommend it.",/review/rw4193765/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2021,gallagherkellie,5," Entertaining but not believable at all
","It's got plenty of action. This woman has 100 lives which is a bit silly but if you look past that it's a decent show. It just feels like the same thing keeps happening over and over again, so after one season I wonder how they did the next four.",/review/rw4193765/?ref_=tt_urv

4 April 2021,rogercg1,8," Well Done. Exciting & Eventful
","Ok. Now, for the bad part. Every performance except for one is exceptional. Unfortunately, the one-dimensional performance by Veronica Falcon diminishes the whole series because she is the co-star. She plays Camila, head of her own cartel. The hype says she's on of Latin America's best actresses. Hell no! She has no depth of character whatsoever. Zero personality with every line delivered it the same way. Can't blame it all on her. Didn't the Director and producers sit down with her and get her to commit to a more rounded villain. God, she's just terrible. I have seldom disliked the performance of a leading character in a series I liked. When she's off screen, the series is a 10.",/review/rw4193765/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2016,PuckerFactor,6," Running out of Breath
",This series started out well but by the time it got to episode 7 it ran out of breath. It's stalling. I find a lot of US shows tend to pad the series out if they think they're onto a good thing. ,/review/rw4193765/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2021,JasonBelle,2," Utterly stupid
","Bad acting bad writing blah blah blah, but the weirdest part is wondering how these criminals ever made a nickel in the first place? Every one of them fighting tooth and nail losing money at every turn. Yet, still living a seemingly lavish lifestyle? Once I saw a group have to steal $500,000 risking all of their lives while sitting in a spare $10+ million dollar home and using a private jet, I couldn't help but wonder are they glorifying drug use or subtly trying to deter all the people with too much time on their hands watching this show from considering the drug industry? In my opinion the criminals in the show are barely smart enough to run a pizza to a neighbor's house and would probably waste three times as much money on gas getting lost along the way.",/review/rw4193765/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2016,jonnithomas,5," I'm surprised at such good reviews. it;s OK but not good.
",People are comparing it to various good gritty series with strong characters and storyline. This has neither but it is OK if you don't think about it too much.,/review/rw4193765/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2016,cherold,5," caught uncomfortably between gritty and glossy
","Judging by the pilot, this show can't quite decide if it wants to be slick, soapy escapist fare or a gritty drug drama. These two elements don't go well together, with the violence and unpleasantness sucking the fun out of the slick soap while the gloss makes the grittiness feel inauthentic.",/review/rw4193765/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2022,dbuckshnis,8," If it's true - sad world we are in - so much killing
","I basically got into this show because I liked some of the key characters. Once James left and new James came in and they were in New Orleans - it became really confusing with all the players and who was working for who and now Camilla is out of the picture, her daughter, James, ... as the death and torture scenes a bit much ... but I'm this far in the series and still like Theresa, Tony (wow he grew up), bodyguard dude, and King James (what a male pig)....",/review/rw4193765/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," As a current cartel kingpin, imo the writing could've been so much better.
","The 62 episodes over the 5 seasons were really dragged out with too much filler and Telemundo soap opera writing. There were also many plot and technical issues that could've easily been avoided, as some were just that obvious and easily fixable. Many of the timeline flashbacks and some relationships were unnecessary. Most of the intimate scenes were dragged out and cheesy. Although there were some crazy gore scenes, they were too few and far in between. More action was needed. Where there was tension and suspense, it was actually good. The casting was great, but not all performances were. My favorite characters (in order) that I actually cared about and performed exceptional were the beautiful and charismatic Molly Burnett as Kelly Anne, Ryan O'Nan as King George, Joseph T. Campos as Boaz, and Hemky Madera as Pote. Unfortunately I was not impressed with Alice Braga as Teresa Mendoza. She lacked energy, was too monotonic and straight faced to the point she looked bored playing her role. Even newb young actress Idalia Valles as Isabela Vargas was more animated and convincing in her role and performance than Braga. Nevertheless, it was enjoyable, but I felt it could've been so much better had the writing been tighter and less melodramatic, and the series shorter. It's a well deserved 7/10 from me.",/review/rw4193765/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2020,dogonlion,8," Got better and better
",At first I gave this a bad rating but then by the end of season 1 it got better. Then it kept getting better and better with a bigger budget. I ended up liking it a lot. Season 4 is the best season.,/review/rw4193765/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2016,davidatom1,7," Great performance, solid action/directing, OK writing
","Alice Braga brings the right mix of grit/grace to the role, but the supporting cast have holes. Not action dominated, acceptable level of production (too sloppy for a movie but OK for TV), mediocre camera angles, solid lighting. As others have said, if you enjoy gritty drug dramas it does the job. ",/review/rw4193765/?ref_=tt_urv
