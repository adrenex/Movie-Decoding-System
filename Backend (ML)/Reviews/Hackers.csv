5 June 2004,Gafke,10," Bloody Brilliant! Literally!
","""Shaun of the Dead"" is not only the best zombie flick I've seen in a long time, it is simply the best film I've seen in a long time, PERIOD! Clever, witty, sweet and nasty and, at times, gory and horrific, SOTD has it all. Of course, I didn't think I could go very far wrong with a film that George Romero himself said he enjoyed.",/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2004,dee.reid,10," When there is no more room in hell, Shaun will walk the earth and...
","...He'll kill some zombies too! Brace yourself for some nonstop zombie action and laughs with the delightful horror-comedy ""Shaun of the Dead.""",/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2004,colettesplace,9," The best rom zom com ever! A loving satire with lots of British humour.
","Shaun's nearing 30, stuck in a crappy sales job, and his girlfriend Liz is unhappy with the amount of time he spends with his ultra-slacker B-class drug dealer friend, Ed, at their local pub, the Winchester. When Liz dumps him, Shaun's so glum he doesn't even realise that London's been overrun with flesh-eating zombies. But somewhere within his console-happy lazy self, a hero is born.",/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2005,BrandtSponseller,10," May be the best comedy-horror mix of recent years
","Shaun (Simon Pegg) is in the midst of a lousy patch--he hates and is embarrassed about his job, he gets no respect from other employees, one of his roommates is on his case about the other roommate--a slacker friend of Shaun's, his girlfriend is on his case about the fact that all the ever do is hang out at a pub, and he hates his stepfather, who is also on his case about doing something nice for his mum. As if that's not bad enough, suddenly, everyone is turning into a zombie. Shaun must both straighten out his life and fight for it at the same time.",/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2005,Boba_Fett1138,8," The power of the movie is in its professionalism.
","This is the best mix of beer and blood I have ever tasted. ""Shaun of the Dead"" has some great comical moments and yet it has been made with lots of professionalism like this was a serious gory horror movie they were making. Because of this, through its seriousness, the movie becomes perhaps even more hilarious and really delivers. Both the fans of the (British) comedy-genre and the fans of mainly 'Zombie' movies and other gory horror-movies, will be entertained by this movie.",/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,Sleepin_Dragon,10," The original zom rom com.

16 April 2004,erolsab,," You'll laugh till it hurts!
","Shaun Of The Dead isn't your typical zombie movie. In fact, the zombies don't truly enter the story until almost a third of the way in. So what's it really about? A man named Shaun, played by Simon Pegg, who lives in London and is a bit of a loser. He works in a dead-end job at an electronic goods store and spends most of his spare time at the local pub or playing video games with his unemployed roomate, Ed. One day Shaun's girlfriend, Liz, decides she's had enough of his lazy attitude and decides to leave him. When the city suddenly gets taken over by the living dead Shaun finds the perfect opportunity to prove himself to Liz, so he sets out to save the day, win his girlfriend back and keep his mum, Barbara, from being eaten by his step-dad who's slowly turning into a zombie.",/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2004,tjcclarke,," Flesh-eating fun for all the family
","The great British sit-com has undergone something of a revival in recent years. Galvanised by the new wave of smart, sassy imports from the US, the Brits have girded their loins and produced a spate of quality comedies that have banished memories of the bland, identikit dross of the late eighties and early nineties.",/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2004,meako1973,10," Like Spaced...with zombies
","In a London suburbia, Shawn is almost 30 and hasn't really achieved much in his life. He comes home from his mundane job each day, and goes to the same pub (The Winchester) that he always has gone to. He shares his flat with an ex-student friend, and his lifelong slob of a friend. On top of that, his girlfriend has had enough of him. Oh.and the dead have started walking the earth!",/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2007,poolandrews,6," A good horror/comedy but somewhat overrated.
","Shaun of the Dead is set in London where Shaun (co-writer Simon Pegg) has problems, his fat mate Ed (Nick Frost) is holding him back, his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) dumps him & then there's the small matter of hordes of flesh eating zombies that risen from the dead to feast on the living. However, Shaun has a plan to save himself, his mate, his ex-girlfriend & his mum & step-dad which involves barricading themselves into his local pub...",/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2021,ethanjjacobs,10," Best comedy and trilogy ever
",Good acting and amazing writing from Edgar wright. Watched this about 20 times and never fails to get a laugh. An absolute classic and by far my favourite comedy. If you haven't watched this yet you really need to.,/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2004,Damian_Piesse,10," Instant cult status.
",Shaun of the Dead is quite a surprising and brilliant piece of work which I suspect will achieve the accolade of instant cult status as word of mouth snowballs this film to richly deserved recognition.,/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2004,bob the moo,," Not wholly successful but a solid horror with laughs - fans of Spaced, Black Books etc will love it!
","Shaun is in his late twenties and works in a electrical store with teenagers.  He hangs out with his slobbish friend and spends every evening in the Winchester pub.  Fed up with this, his girlfriend dumps him, leaving him with the words of his other flatmate ringing in his ears - `sort your life out'.  His plans take an unexpected turn when he and Ed eventually notice that London's populace has mostly given into a virus that turns them into, well, the Z word.  Shaun and Ed devise a plan to keep safe and rescue Shaun's mother and ex.",/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2022,FeastMode,4," Unpopular opinion
","I know this is a fan favorite, cult classic, whatever you want to call it. I've never been a fan. I even gave it another chance all these years later and still feel the same. It's pretty funny early on, but there are almost no laughs in the second half. There's a bunch of unnecessary and annoying relationship drama (not the family stuff, that was good). And there are a bunch of really stupid parts. Overall it's not terrible, but it's not good either. (about 3 viewings, 8/6/2022)",/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2005,Gambitt,6," Just didn't click with me

19 October 2021,cricketbat,10," Shaun of the Dead is a slice of fried gold
","Shaun of the Dead is one of my all-time favorite films. This horror comedy manages to parody the zombie genre while still standing solidly within it. The story is creative, the humor is quick and clever, the characters are memorable, it's endlessly quotable, and it also manages to generate some real fear and genuine emotions. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg created a special kind of magic with Shaun of the Dead. Simply put, this movie is a slice of fried gold.",/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2020,Ch4ndler_B1ng,10," A Comedy for the Ages!
","Shaun of the Dead is directed by Edgar Wright and stars Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Kate Ashfield as its lead characters. The movie starts off with a conversation between Shaun and his wife, she's telling him that they should spend more time together. Shaun lives with his... ahem ""best friend"" and Liz says that Shaun living with Ed is a bit too far and maybe he ought to spend more quality time with her. There are some hilarious moments at the drinking table when they look over at the people sitting over at the table talking about them and say e.g, ""Ed, it's not that I don't like you.""",/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2010,TheLittleSongbird,9," Funny and really entertaining, even if it is a one-joke concept it is one that works
","I thought that Shaun of the Dead wouldn't be my style, I seriously thought I would hate it. But no...I loved it. Some parts do drag, especially the beginning which took a little too long to get going, but I loved the film's deadpan and offbeat style and effortless mix of undergraduate humour and hardcore horror. If you love blood and gore, you have found your match with Shaun of the Dead, and if you love offbeat and sophisticated humour delivered in a deadpan way you have also met your match. The cinematography is innovative and unique, the music just adds to the atmosphere, the screenplay is extraordinarily clever and hilarious and the story is original and well constructed. Another strong asset is the cast, Simon Pegg is just wonderful, and Nick Frost is hilarious. Then we have great actors like Penelope Wilton and Bill Nighy who are terrific as Barbara and Phillip. Overall, just a great film, although it is a one-joke concept it actually works. 9/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2004,Grigory_the_Wanderer,10," The best comedy of the year!
","Here in the States they don't show too many foreign movies, even if they are from the countries like UK. When they show them, however, they tend to outdo some of the American movies in the box office. Although the British movies are rarely shown here, they're a guaranteed success - do you recall the popularity of the last year's ""28 Days Later""? Well, this movie is even better - it's a hilarious combination of comedy, social parody, tragedy and drama, spiced with the references to every zombie flick ever made. Some references are pretty slim, though - for example ""We're coming to get you, Barbara!"" is a reference to ""The Night of the Living Dead"" - a reference that many people (including George Romero!) didn't get. Most of the actors are unknown to an average American, yet they played great! I hope that movies like ""Shaun of the Dead"" will make big wigs in Hollywood realize that there are many great foreign movies, and that integrity is always better than crude remakes which the States are so notorious for... I encourage everybody to come and see SOTD - the best comedy of 2004.",/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2017,Hitchcoc,9," Fun for the Whole Family
","My son dragged me to see this. I've gone with him to his comic book movies, his other zombie movies, and on and on. So I was set for one of those Dad-is- willing-to-give-up-a-day things. This utterly tongue in cheek masterpiece had me from the get-go. There are so many sight gags and pop culture references, so many goofy encounters, so much character to the undead, I really enjoyed this. I see now why it became a cult film because it is infinitely quotable and full of absurdities. It also has a really fine cinematic sense. I also loved what the role of the zombies is at the end of the picture. If one has ever worked with high school boys (or lazy male young adults), you will find a great deal to enjoy here. Really!!!",/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv

","Some 5 years before the making of this film the same team behind it wrote and directed series (season) 1 and 2 of an offbeat UK sitcom named ""Spaced"".

14 June 2006,ccthemovieman-1,7," Snatch-Like Brit Zombies
","I guess you could call this a combination of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Snatch,"" the latter used as a comparison because of it's modern-day dark humor, That's what this film is: a combination of irreverent, modern-day attitudes and profanity from young Brits and a re-make of sorts of a famous horror film.",/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2005,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," Despite the story being used a million times, this is a very funny film
","My cousin had called me from London a few months ago and told me about this film. She also asked if there were any trailers or release dates in the states, I didn't know. I never even heard of the film, but it sounded hysterical. I did see the theatrical trailer a week later, but I was saddened that there was no theater around that was playing this flick. Finally it came out for rent, and I grabbed it immediately. I'm glad I did. ",/review/rw6686488/?ref_=tt_urv
