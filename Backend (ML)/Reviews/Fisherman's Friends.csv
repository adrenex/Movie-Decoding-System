","What a unique production! Netflix definitely got something (very) right here. In fact, I wish there would be more quality content like this.",/review/rw6919361/?ref_=tt_urv

",Season one was incredible. A little something for anyone. Great variety and vision in small samples. Like short stories. It was 18 episodes!,/review/rw6919361/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2019,ahmetkozan,9," The Peak of Animation!
","We are faced with an incredibly creative anthology of 18 different stories ranging from an immense variety of animation designs, cinematography, music-sound use, and transhumanism to cyber punk, from robotics to artificial intelligence, from the life of others to anti-militarism: Love, Death & Robots.",/review/rw6919361/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2020,MR-ODIN,," Love, Death & Robots
","This show is a masterpiece. Every episode feels like a complete movie. I was surprised that I was able to care for the characters after such a short time. Most shows take 2 or 3 hours to be able to establish that kind of a rapport. The pacing is great, the topics explored are interesting and some of the plot twists are amazing. One of the episodes managed to flip my understanding of all the events completely on its head just in the last few seconds when the truth was finally revealed.",/review/rw6919361/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2019,grantit4,10," Netflix just changed the game... again.
","Sublimely animated (NSFW) shorts... each with it's own unique and beautiful (& mature) story. Think game cinematic-Animatrix saga with hyper-realistic futurism/multi-dimensional concepts. Absolutely GORGEOUS. I enjoyed each immensely, and cannot wait to see more, hopefully becoming a mainstream format.",/review/rw6919361/?ref_=tt_urv

15 March 2019,javierrickard,10," Not a minute feels wasted watching this amazing anthology series
","Honestly it just appeared on Netflix so I thought why not give it a try? and I am so happy I did. Every episode is so beautifully animated and the stories keep you interested from beginning to end! The most impressive and immersive thing Netflix has done in a little while, you aren't wasting you're time. believe me.",/review/rw6919361/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2021,searchanddestroy-1,9," Animation at its best
","I am not a fan at all of animation stuff, nor modern scifi and fantasy too. But this series which was advised by a friend amazes me, because it is so gloomy, dark, disturbing, maybe too complex though, that I am addicted to it. Unfortunately, most of those stories could not be adapted for the big screen in classic regular movies. Too shocking for most audiences. I highly recommand it to anyone seeking something different. Don't expect happy endings here, no do not, you would be deceived. Or maybe once in a while.",/review/rw6919361/?ref_=tt_urv

","Bless you, Netflix, for giving us this.",/review/rw6919361/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2020,MogwaiMovieReviews,5," Pretty On Top but Empty Inside
","Clearly created both by and for a generation that has grown up deeply embedded in video games, Love, Death & Robots inevitably seems to reflect a similar drop in attention span and a curiously singleminded focus on surface shocks and flashy spectacle at the expense of everything else. Indeed, the storylines (and animation) often feel like little more than intros to games, with as much depth, believability and emotion.",/review/rw6919361/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2021,fagzal,7," Season 1: amazing. Season 2: what happened??
","I really liked season 1 of the series: a new kind of format, amazing graphics, sometimes thought provoking and serious, even dark, sometimes just simply funny. Diverse themes and animation styles. It was kind of like Black Mirror, but animated. Or like reading a collections sci-fi short stories.",/review/rw6919361/?ref_=tt_urv

15 May 2021,jwdb-11864,7," The Second Season...
","Making this review to compare the first season to the second. The first season is almost perfection. Most of its individual episodes have great stories and meaning behind them, they have originality. Even the worst episodes in season one are watchable and have some level of entertainment. The first season has lots of re-watchability to it. But then they released the second season. It's got plenty of episodes with cool concepts but they drag on. I, and many other people, felt let-down by the subsequent season. So far it only has eight episodes, and those eight episodes feel like they were episodes cut from the first season. It isn't horrible, but once you see it all, you don't want to watch it again. Its worst episodes are unbearable and its best are inferior compared to the first season. It contains episodes where the characters make dumb decisions, and its got plenty of episodes that are hard to understand.",/review/rw6919361/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2022,MamadNobari97,7," Enjoyed Season 3 More Than 2, but That's Not Saying Much
","So as I pointed out in my last review of the show, I thought season 1 was great, it was fresh, new, and gave us some of the most creative short animations we've seen. It actually had decent stories too and wasn't just art style galore.",/review/rw6919361/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2019,mahmus,5," A mixed bag
","The thing that all the episodes have in common is this: they are all very well animated. Other than that, the quality of these short episodes ranges from very good, to ok, to really bad. Here' a quick summary of each episode with ratings:",/review/rw6919361/?ref_=tt_urv

16 May 2021,educrkp,7," 1st season was better
","I feel like some of the episodes in season 2 were a little too short, and there were less than half as many episodes as season 1, so all in all season 2 was a little disappointing. It's not bad; season 1 just set the bar too high.",/review/rw6919361/?ref_=tt_urv

15 March 2019,ankitb-civilengg,9," Unexpectedly good!
","Never saw the trailer. Just saw it while browsing netflix, didn't knew what to expect. But the first episode just blew my mind. So awesome. It was like watching watching a video game. The episodes are small but so good. No nonsense. Superb !!!",/review/rw6919361/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2019,starving_college_student,8," I wish there were more shows like this
","Love, Death and Robots isn't for everyone. It's gratuitously violent, salacious to a fault, and not politically correct. And that's exactly what Hollywood needs to do more of. No, it doesn't need to make films that are violent, over-sexed or obscene (it's already doing that). It needs to stop making things 'for everybody.' LD&R is obviously going to offend or turn off some, but that's because it's not made for them. But for those who have been waiting for a true animated version of Heavy Metal Magazine, then this is for you. It's got cyberpunk, odd fiction, silly stories and all the sci-fi you could possibly want. What's more, each story is really well made (unlike some attempts to bring Heavy Metal to film). If you like short films, CG, sci-fi or Adult Swim, you're not going to want to miss Love, Death & Robots.",/review/rw6919361/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2019,vasiln,9," Spiritual Successor to Heavy Metal
","Love, Death & Robots is an anthology of animated science-fiction shorts. A few stories use live actors but heavy use of animation in the whole. Most of the animation is CG-- some might be hand-drawn or might be really well stylized CG, I'm not sure.",/review/rw6919361/?ref_=tt_urv
