",Food tastes better there. The women are naturally beautiful. Walks are more romantic. Wine is more complex... but life is less so. France can turn good memories into grand ones. It replaces currency with passion. It replaces accumulation with appreciation.,/review/rw1627404/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2006,saarvardi,8," As it's title may imply, ""A Good Year"" is just that: a good film by Ridley Scott
","I had the chance to see this film during an early press screening in Ramat Gan, Israel, several weeks ago, and was pleasantly surprised. A good friend of mine that came along was thrilled with the views and landscapes and caught up with the dramatic plot, despite having a distinct preference for action flicks. Speaking of which, here's a chance to give a little tip for the guys: although this is generally referred to as a ""chick flick"", the screen is filled with the presence of 2 beautiful women throughout the film. Watch out for the young Abbie Cornish (who appears in a brief nude sequence, so don't blink) and for the arousing french actress Marion Cotillard as Crowe's love interest throughout the film.",/review/rw1627404/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2015,namashi_1,9," A Simple, Feel-Good Film...
","Based on the 2004 novel of the same name by British author Peter Mayle, 'A Good Year' is A Simple, Feel-Good Film, made none other than the Master himself, Sir Ridley Scott. This rather under-rated film is a combination of subtle romance & engaging humour. ",/review/rw1627404/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2008,lastliberal,7," It's your life that does not suit this place.
","Who wouldn't want an uncle that left them a vineyard in Provence? Why would anyone have to think twice about a life of sipping wine and Marion Cotillard, who looked her real beautiful self, and not the character she portrayed in La Vie en rose? But, Russell Crowe was making this choice and provided an enjoyable romantic comedy about a successful trader that inherits a château in France. Crowe provided just the right touch in this film. The comedy was subtle and not overdone had they cast someone like Hugh Grant for the lead. The magic with Cotillard could not have been done with anyone else either.",/review/rw1627404/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2006,lostein,9," A Delightful Way to Spend an Evening
","As a longtime fan of Russell Crowe, I do know that he can be funny, charming, sweet and romantic, not only on film but in real life. His recent appearances on the TV promotional circuit have proved this once again. Those who only know his films since LA Confidential for the most part focus on his ability to capture and project power, strength and inner turmoil. Those who have seen his films such as Proof, For the Moment, Love In Limbo and The Sum of Us have seen his ability to show the gentler, funnier and often more uncertain sides of the human experience. (I would also argue that these are readily seen in his films such as The Insider, A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man.) A Good Year is a wonderful return to the Russell of those earlier films. Like a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie, you know just where it's likely going to take you, but with such lovely, engaging people in such a wonderful setting you just want to enjoy the trip. And so you shall. What a refreshing change from the overheated, oversexed, over special ""effected"" and over bloodied fare that Hollywood usually dishes out. Thank you so much Mr. Crowe and Mr. Scott for my little vacation in the South of France!",/review/rw1627404/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2006,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: A Good Year
","The first time director Ridley Scott and actor Russell Crowe paired together, they made the award winning Gladiator, and perhaps surprised folks that a mainstream action movie could snag the best picture Oscar. Here, they come together again for a pretty feel good movie, but I don't expect that this would win any major honours. Not that it's a bad film, but it's quite vanilla plain, that you could guess every other step of how the narrative and plot will unfold.",/review/rw1627404/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2006,JackCerf,4," Incredible and Uninvolving
","Watching this fantasy of cashing out to live a life of food, wine, sex and sunlit idleness in Provence, you don't suspend disbelief for a minute. Right at the outset we are shown that Russell Crowe's character is exactly what his beloved uncle calls him when he cheats at chess as a boy -- ""a little s**t."" Now grown up, he enjoys making money by cheating, not so much for the money, though that's nice too, but for the sheer pleasure of dominating others by being smarter, tougher and more ruthless than they are. Since, he's surrounded by agreeably available women in London (the movie tries to make a running joke of flashes and cleavage shots) it is clear that he needn't sleep alone. Nothing Crowe does makes us believe that he is less than perfectly satisfied with the life he leads, or that he would give it up to take up with a Provencal girl and contendedly guzzle home grown wine on the terrace. Nothing convinces that he and she are made for each other, or that she should see him as anything but a good looking rich foreigner who'll be an enjoyable but short-lived roll in the hay. Because Crowe's boss writes him a thumping severance check when he turns down a partnership and leaves the firm, his choice is too easy to be interesting. His buddy the real estate agent has it right. After six months he'll be bored to death, up to his ears in some financial shenanigan, and probably fooling around on his honey just to prove to himself that he can get away with it.",/review/rw1627404/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2006,bopdog,7," Pleasant and likable. Gorgeous views. But does not quite live up to its pedigree.
","You can't not like this movie. the scenery is absolutely jaw-dropping, drop-dead gorgeous. It's worth a trip to the cinema just to bask in the lush French countryside. With such stellar talent as Ridley Scott, Albert Finney, and Russel Crowe, however, one expected a tad bit more.",/review/rw1627404/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2006,come2whereimfrom,7," OK comedy/drama from Scott
","Comedy drama and Ridley Scott are not two things you would normally associate, Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott are, so teaming up again after 'Gladiator' they join forces to bring us 'A Good Year'. It is the story of a high-flying stockbroker (Crowe) who is basically an absolute person without a father, he cares about no one, loves money and especially loves being an arrogant git. But when his uncle Henry dies and leaves him a vineyard in France his initial thoughts are how much can he sell it for but over the course of the film he awakens within himself distant memories he thought he'd buried and begins to see things a little differently. Splashed with a little tragedy as well as the humour the film does make you think about some of life's big questions such as is money important? or is love important? What makes someone happy? Etc but without ever being over sentimental or too deep. The film is populated by an array of characters both in London and France that add a richness to Crowe's central performance and some unusual camera work from Scott make the film flow along at a pace just above relaxing. The scenery is as beautiful as you can expect from the south of France and forms a lush backdrop to the proceedings, as does Henry's run down villa. Ultimately it is a film about one mans struggle with his identity in a world where he thought he had to behave a certain way. It is his interaction with the people he meets and the lessons he realises he learnt from Henry as a child that in a way were detrimental to start with but eventually lead him to make the right choices. Well directed and acted, this is a film that wears its heart on it sleeve, it is warm and welcoming, funny and sad, different from his usual subject matter but none the less another film Scott can be proud of.",/review/rw1627404/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2006,EUyeshima,7," The Romantic Emancipation of Russell Crowe
","I have to admit this 2006 movie based on the book by Peter Mayle (whose ""A Year in Provence"" is a favorite of mine) starts rather unpromisingly since it carries the same smug, self-satisfied attitude that its hero has. Director Ridley Scott takes a while to find the right rhythm for this romantic comedy, but he eventually does, even if it means recycling elements from other similarly executed fish-out-of-water films like ""Baby Boom"", ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Under the Tuscan Sun"". In fact, the whole venture feels decidedly old-fashioned with formula elements feeling like they come from some Universal film made in the 1960's, but the retro-chic aspect somehow works like a fictionalized account of a lifestyle cable channel program since there is little in the way of real dramatic conflict.",/review/rw1627404/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2006,frances-37,8," A very enjoyable film with lots of laughs and excellent performances.
","A demographically mixed audience seemed to enjoy this film very much. The photography was beautiful, the acting excellent, and the supporting players added an extra ""punch"" to the story line. Tho not an exact replica of the book it is based more on a story line running thru Crowe's and Marion's characters. The emphasis being on Crowe's character finding out what is truly meaningful in his very hectic super-charged rather non ethical life. He rediscovers what he is missing i.e. love, trust, and friendships.",/review/rw1627404/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2020,djbrown-00897,10," A Modern Classic
","There are two exceptionally beautiful things about A Good Year: Marion Cotillard and the French Countryside ( wine vineyard included). As for Russell Crowe, he is a great actor ( LA Confidential in particular), but it is unusual to see him in a light role, and he excels at it. His character Max is a cutthroat London trader who inherits his uncle's French vineyard and goes to sell it, but has second thoughts. Spoilers ahead: In the end, it came down to the choice of his job and being being a partner in the firm where he worked ( and being like his boss), or not selling the vineyard and living in France. He realized that he is much happier in France. Especially being with Fanny ( Cotillard) who he realizes is his soul mate. He actually met her as a child, and she gave him his first kiss. She also said to him ""Forgive my lips they find pleasure in unusual places."" Fanny forgot that incident until he reminded her by repeating those words. It made her realize Max was her soul mate as well. There is a line by Max that sums everything up: ""I want to spend my life with an irrational, suspicious, goddess"", and that is exactly what he will do. One of my favorite movies of the past 20 years. A very easy 10/10 stars.",/review/rw1627404/?ref_=tt_urv

","I enjoyed this movie, it had class and character with some lovely ladies. Also I enjoyed the London footage with the contrast against France. Crowe, I think did very well and I was surprised at the end because I didn't now it was a Ridley Scott movie. It would now be interesting to read the book to see how closely it is represented. All things seemed to fit, and it was evident in last encounter with Crowe and his French girl from the scene of when he was a boy at the pool. Great romantic portrayal of an English French relationship. The movie also maintained a good level of humour encased with good vocabulary. I had heard this was a good movie and am glad to able to cement that in words.",/review/rw1627404/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2013,ipekmine,10," Delightful!
","The critics/reviews and IMDb rating don't do justice to A Good Year, in my opinion. What's there not to love? A sweet story is translated into a fun screenplay with beautiful scenery throughout the entire film, the cast is doing a very good job and unlike you'd expect from the genre, the movie is not full of clichés at all! Max is a very real, familiar character, and his 'inner journey' from London to Provence is reflected in a nice flow without slowing the pace or boring the viewer. Had a mediocre director been involved, the rest of the characters would end up being too insignificant and cast would be wiped away to the level of being invisible by Russell Crowe's superb performance but no, R. Scott manages to balance it all and somehow takes it from being a ""one man movie"" to a delightfully enjoyable piece of work! Guess you can't go wrong with Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe, can you. Last, but not least, the soundtrack is simply a great bonus to the lovely experience of A Good Year.",/review/rw1627404/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2006,federicone,8," Plot summary is wrong.
","The American woman does not claim that the land is hers, but tries to know something about his past. Ridley Scott exploit his good taste to create a charming atmosphere, in which Russel Crowe is just an extra piece of the story. The landscapes, the Provence feeling, the interesting women, and the enchanting world of wine makes you fly between the clouds and wonder: ""what if I leave my job right now and start living the real life?"". Russel Crowe successes in playing a clumsy business man who realizes he has to make a change. Albert Finney minor appearances are brilliant. It is a movie about feelings, enjoying life, and finding yourself. You have to see it.",/review/rw1627404/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2007,TxMike,," Set in Provence, a fine movie of Peter Mayle's book.
","Back in the early 1990s Peter Mayle and his wife Annie left their corporate lives in England to movie to southern France. Peter wanted inspiration to follow his dream to become a successful author. Their first year in France provided food for his first book, a mostly non-fiction work called ""A Year in Provence."" Then, this was turned into a 6-hour mini-series, which is a fascinating look at how a Brit settles into France.",/review/rw1627404/?ref_=tt_urv
