28 September 2022,Lil_Git,10," Wanted to hate this so much....
","I started off absolutely hating this reboot of one of my favorite TV shows. I thought it was badly written, over the top woke bs and I was absolutely gonna vote this down and give it a one star review.",/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,blebbe,7," Surprisingly good
","I expected this to be another one of those poorly produced Netflix dramas that try to seem relatable to teenagers, but miserably fail at it. But I was surprised in many ways. Sure, it's still a pretty unrealistic portrayal of teenagers, but it had some nice parts. There are a variety of different stories in this series, some of them are pretty interesting. The characters themselves very interesting as well. The acting was surprisingly good too. Some of the comedy fell a little short and won't probably work in a few years, but nothing too bad. Sometimes I think the series was even making fun of today's teenage culture. I wish it had leaned more towards that, because it would have been a more interesting take. All in all: a good binge watch!",/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2022,vanessxisabelle,10," Better than Sex Education
","Absolutely obsessed with this show. It definitely gave me Sex Education vibes but in my opinion it's even better. I could relate to Amerie so well, Ca$h and Darren and Quinnie and Malakai were such amazing and loveable, relatable characters (even if they were frustrating at times, but that's just what made it so much more realistic). Loved the continuous, not really foreseeable storyline between Harper and Amerie, it always kept the plot even more interesting and made it impossible to stop watching. Every single character beought something important to the table and the whole show is just so so up to date and therefore an incredibly good, important remake that touches all the right topics!",/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,Imme-van-Gorp,9," Really well-done high school drama with a lot of great storylines.

17 September 2022,sahorlings,10," Very relatable
","I have never seen an accurate representation of myself in any serie. Quinni was the first autistic girl I have seen accurately portrayed how it feels to be afab and autistic. Not the classic white boys like sheldon and sherlock. And to top it off, Quinni was actually played by an autistic actor! I finally felt really understood.",/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2022,eringuest-24931,9," The best representation of autism onscreen that I've ever seen.
","Finally, autistic actors are being casted to play autistic characters. This series was the first time I've ever seen myself authentically represented on-screen, the first time I've seen myself shown as anything other than a punchline or a cause for pity. I hope this is the start of change for representation of autistic people in media.",/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2022,kickever,10," What an absolute banger
","We need more good Aussie shows like this, they're relatable, deep, funny and has so much diversity. To the LGBTQIA's, indigenous, disabilities and the personalities. It honestly could impact all of Australia and the way things work.",/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,leylayilmaz-13010,10," AMAZING!! SEASON 2 NEEDED!!
","I watched this show not really knowing what to expect, but I loved it and binged it all in two days!! There's someone in it that anyone can relate to, the representation is so so well done. The accurate autism portrayal by an ACTUALLY autistic actress is HUGE, and i'm sure it is a MASSIVE step in the film industry becoming more inclusive, correctly. The acting by everyone is incredible, and I couldn't believe that for most of the cast this was their first break! I can't wait to see what heartbreak high will bring for the actors' futures as they are all so incredibly talented. Hopefully a season 2 is in the making, I can't wait for it!!",/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,apryla-58795,6," Brittany Murphy is back
","High schoolers with loads of problems face every kind of issue you can think of and more. Typical high school stuff but on steroids. I was prepared to really roll my eyes at this but then I binged the whole thing. The acting is actually really good which is surprising because some of these are actors with barely any roles under their belts. I never saw the original Heartbreak High so I can't speak of any differences but I doubt it would matter because this show obviously reflects the times. Every show is going overboard on making sure they are representing every single race, sexual preference etc...it's a bit much and comes across as disingenuous because it seems like virtue signaling and not because it comes from a legit place. You can almost see the director ticking off the boxes. Other than that I can't say I loved this but it did hold my interest and I would most likely watch another season if they have it.",/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2022,lcot-61244,10," It has it's flaws but the positives outweigh them
","A decently accurate representation of teens in Australia with a great cast of flawed characters that you find yourself being really invested in. They all have their own depth and no one feels like an unnecessary addition. Sex is a main theme but it is never shown or referenced in a way that feels unnecessary or gratuitous. It is well paced and written, nothing feels unearned.",/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv

",As a massive fan of the original series in the 90s and am very happy that the powers that be deemed it was worthy of a reboot cause it really is.,/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2022,syd_reeses_pieces,8," 8.5 Great Aussie Series
","Amazing show, funny, emotional, great three-dimensional characters that highlight just how diverse the Australian population is. More realistic than Euphoria, think it will definitely appeal to fans of Sex Education (but not as graphic so okay for younger teens ~15). Really captured the experience of growing up in Australia. The casting was amazing, and the diversity in the cast really let the writers explore so many different Aussie experiences, especially loved seeing the Aboriginal representation actually done well. Great Aussie music too (The Divinyls, and strawberry kisses were fun throwbacks), will be devo'd if this isn't renewed ;) want season 2 asap.",/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,waitresstyles,7," As a gen z, yes.
","As a gen z teen who watches all the latest I find myself cringing at a lot of teen shows nowadays. It's too 80s with the whole vibe, or painfully older than teen years. I wanted to hate this show but I think it's the best gen z rep I've seen. It just has so many true aspects to it of being a teen nowadays and even how they presented romance in the show for teen years. Wish we could have seen more to be honest, it's a show I would watch a few seasons worth if they came out but still loved it even without the extension. Good show and felt like someone from my generation helped write it , very relatable.",/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,annemaree-99074,7," The kids are alright for now
","Wow, this show is polarising: people here either love or hate it. It sit somewhere in the middle, awarding Heartbreak High (HH) a 7.5 with pros and cons. First: the pros. The show was much better than I expected, quite funny and entertaining. I loved the Sydney setting because I tried to guess the suburbs, beaches and schools featured in episodes. I thought the diverse cast were mostly very good: the different gender identities were much needed in Australian TV shows which tend to present a generic vanilla lifestyle to international audiences. I thought HH successfully balanced themes teenage audiences care about with intergenerational dramas with their parents. Praise be to the writers for making Generation X parents slightly cool. One example was how the latter reacted with amusement to the school protest. I hope to see more exploration of the two generations in the next season.",/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv

27 September 2022,lampadaire20002,5," Not bad but
","Not a bad show at all , but it's really weird that for a remake of ""heartbreak high"",this look so much like ""sex education"" ...
I just stopped watching it because it's weird to watch :you feel like you're watching a show you liked very much but it's not really the same so it kind of ruin both of the shows ...
I think writers (even if they have pressure from the company who hire them to produce something bankable) should find something in their plot that will have its own originality : not only mix ""sex education"" with ""13 reasons"" ?",/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2022,laurelwhicker,8," A die hard original heartbreak high fan
",It's good but not as good as the original. Although you do see a original cast member in a couple scenes I wish you saw much more of him and other original cast members as that's what I think it's missing.,/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv

13 October 2022,LolaMarria,10," Actually autistic representation!!!
","A show that actually listens to autistic voices instead of suppressing them. This is the first time I've ever related to a character so much. Quinni is amazing and so is Chloe Hayden. Episode ""Angeline"" is literally the truth of what it is like being autistic in the modern world and the challenges we face when it comes to ableism. The fact that Chloe got a say in the character, that is the future! <3. After the last few years of ableism the community has faced this is exactly what we needed. It's heartwarming. The performance is so amazing and I can't fault it one bit. It makes me proud to be autistic and helps me feel more accepted!",/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2022,mark-94811,10," Absolutely brilliant
",Heartbreak High is a brilliant Australian show. I loved the original series and it remakes are always a risk but they have done an incredible job. Many of the references and slang might confuse foreign audiences but it would still be very watchable and engaging. The acting is excellent and avoids the common cringe factor we get with high school settings. Some may see this as derivative of Sex Education but the original vastly predates this other great series. There is careful effort to ensure queer representation but not in a way that might be seen as a 'woke agenda'. Ending is not an entirely happy one but still very apt.,/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2022,zso88,10," Amazing show
",Finally something new and refreshing. I honestly didn't expect this show to be this good. I assumed that just like every other new Netflix series in this genre that it would be quite forgettable but it was just the opposite.,/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2022,Carambotti,2," A show that literally ""maps"" the sex lives of teenagers. Got it!
","Astonishing how casually flippant these writers treat heavy subject matter in this show. The primary tension running through the first 7 episodes is the flimsiest framework to hang this teen drama upon. Amerie can't figure out why her bff Harper suddenly turns against her without any explanation. For 7 episodes the viewer is wondering what Amerie could possibly have done that would warrant this behavior. But, teens gotta do what they wants to do. So they proceed to hookup, in various permutations, filling out that ""map"".",/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2022,chloegrayling,10," Sex Education x 13 Reasons Why x Veronica Mars (but Australian)
","This show is a shoot and a score for so many reasons. Firstly, it feels like it was written by young people - not people pretending to be young. It's socially aware and an accurate representation of being on the cusp of adulthood in 2022: and I say that as somebody who is almost 30, but who works with young people in my career.",/review/rw8554754/?ref_=tt_urv
