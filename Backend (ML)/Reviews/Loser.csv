8 August 2021,plasmapilot,10," A UNIQUE TWIST ON A TYPICAL HOLLYWOOD LOVE TALE
",This engaging love story took me by surprise! I found the actors to be dynamic and their chemistry lent cohesion to this production. The musical score and occasional chuckles brought levity and balance to the film. I really enjoyed this refreshing approach to the genre and actually applauded at the conclusion! Snuggle up and relax with this gem.,/review/rw8532860/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2020,vivat_r,7," Sweet Execution on a Classically Contrived Romance Premise
","Perfect for fans of the Hallmark/Lifetime Romance genre. While #ChristmasRomance is the currently most prolific stereotype, #FakeEngagement is also a reliable chestnut that comes around regularly. So, nope, nothing whatsoever realistic about the set-up. But, I didn't come to this expecting otherwise.",/review/rw8532860/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2020,david-161-28390,10," Sweet, funny, well acted, heart-warming and well acted.
","A great family movie with a good moral undertone - but never preaching. A nice theme of redemption, a couple of contenents and no shortage of laughts. Made me think about parenting skills - never a bad thing!",/review/rw8532860/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2020,melora-61953,9," Classic!!
",A well executed movie that took me back to the classics of Cary Grant and Doris Day! Filled with plenty of magical movie moments! Great job to All!,/review/rw8532860/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2021,ghgaskins,9," Classic Romance
","This is a textbook romance movie from every aspect. Very funny and well acted. If you don't like this movie, you're probably old with no sense of humor. I read some reviews that state its unrealistic, but so what, all romance even real is a fantasy. If this wasn't on Netflix it would show on Hallmark Channel, but it has better actors that are more convincing in their roles. Both lead characters demonstrate romantic chemistry carrying the highs and lows like its really happening. A fun movie and great cast. It's all good.",/review/rw8532860/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2020,sevdekaldiroglu,1," Umm Africa is not one country...
","In addition to the horribly lazy writing, plot holes and the cringeworthy acting, one of the most annoying aspects of this movie is that the screenwriters don't seem to know (or care) that Africa is a huge continent with many different countries and cultures. From the beginning, everyone refers to the country the main character is traveling to as ""Africa"" and talk about the cliche stereotypes around ""Africans"" without specificity.",/review/rw8532860/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2020,GarnetVersus7,6," It was good. Had some things I didn't like.
","I turned this on gearing myself up for terrible acting and unfunny jokes. But, I was actually wrong. It made me laugh which is crazy hard to do from a comedy movie, and I wasn't impressed with the acting but it wasn't terrible. Now, what I was upset about, the ending. The ending was so confusing and we don't even know what happened with Tyrell and if he ever got the money back from Fake Mtumbe. There are tons of plot holes and filled with my ultimate movie and book pet peeve, introducing conflict without resolution. So summary, it was funny and I liked it. I didn't feel chemistry between the two characters and it seemed like they were only ""in love"" because the movie told as they were and not because the viewers felt it.",/review/rw8532860/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2020,WhateverIWant29,2," Plot holes, ignorant stereotypes and t
","Saddens me to write this as I love to see and support black people on screen, we know it's not always been a thing. However, the story makes no sense, its too far from reality and not executed in a way good enough to suspend disbelief. Disappointing film, can't recommend wasting your life watching it. Plot holes, embarrassing errors and ignorance littered throughout as if the information is not readily available. There was a great opportunity for a bit of representation, albeit with humour, but it felt like a film directed and written by a lazy author with little scrambled knowledge of 'Africa', that mainly consisted of what they saw on ""Coming to America"". It's irritating that in 2020 films still continue to perpetuate tired, old ignorant tropes about African people and actually present it as humor. The film talks of Africa as if it's a monolith, there are approx 54 very different countries with nearly 2000 languages, different dialects and distinct accents depending on geographic region. With globalisation, the internet and the large amount of first and second gen African presence in the west, it wouldn't have been hard to do a little research or find just a couple of people to help. This really overshadows much of the film because it's entwined in the main storyline. It's a shame because the main actors are not terrible but the material they had to work with is poor. Other than the embarrassingly ignorant cultural references and jokes throughout, the storyline is outlandish, fragmented and far fetched. I hope to see the main actors shine in other films, they had nice onscreen chemistry and I've seen most perform very well in other shows/films. I'm definitely here for representation, but please do it properly. The actors and we the audience deserve better.",/review/rw8532860/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2018,csn-78149,10," Great family movie!
","What a great movie! So much fun, great South African scenery, fabulous soundtrack. Shamier does such a great job and is so funny. Amber also plays such a great role. Fun for the whole family. A few twists along the way make for just a great funny movie experience!",/review/rw8532860/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2020,nicorip22,3," Poor romantic comedy
","The error that they made making Africa a country, oh my god... But apart from that it is a poor comedy that you may laugh once or twice.",/review/rw8532860/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2021,kathi-22236,8," Really cute and fun
","I gave it a high rating because I had a good time watching it. I needed something light hearted after an episode of Game of Thrones I'd just seen, and this movie really filled the bill. It certainly wasn't brilliant movie making, but it was just what I needed tonight. I admit that I love hokey romantic comedies and Love Jacked is just that. And it didn't hurt that the actors were good looking and hot. üòÅ",/review/rw8532860/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2021,guyadiangold,9," Some issues, but overall entertaining
","There were a lot of issues with the movie, like paying for a fake wedding and fake funeral! Sure, the family owned a business, but I doubt they had that kind of money to waste. It's unfortunate Maya went to such extremes to prove her father wrong.",/review/rw8532860/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2021,thecanadian-23317,6," 100% predictable, but still cute
","This is one of those movies where you'll read the synopsis and know exactly how it ends - it's basically a Hallmark movie. But I still thought it was really cute. I'm a big fan of Amber Steven West and she was really likable in the movie. There were some fun situations with her fake fianc√© as well that got some good chuckles from me. Is it a movie I'll ever watch again? Probably not, but I enjoyed watching it the one time.",/review/rw8532860/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2020,lollygirl-58301,2," Cringe worthy & Ignorant!

12 October 2020,khris_sik,3," Really?... that's not how my people behave!!!
","Despite the movie having it's funny moments here and there I absolutely don't agree with the perception it has on the behaviour and being of Africans!!!
I mean why does Malcolm have to talk like that and dress like that!!! It gives people a wrong and stereotypical perception of Africans.
Making it seem like we're primitive in some nature... especially with that accent and weird way Malcolm was impersonating Mtumbi!!!
Africans can speak proper English and do wear normal western clothes... or different clothes they feel like wearing.
What y'all need to do is stop ranting over Emily in Paris and rant over this failed attempt at a culturally diverse romantic comedy.",/review/rw8532860/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2022,kosmasp,8," Simple yet effective
","Yes the premise is more than just simple. But it works - and it has to do with the actors and the chemistry they are able to conjur up. I wouldn't call myself a big fan of Mike Epps for example (as I sometimes love/like him in movies and I sometimes feel he is annoying - his character that is of course, I am more than certain that he is a lovely person in private), but I think even in the minor role he plays here, he is able to elevate the movie. Take Keith David as the father - what a great choice! And what a great performance he gives too.",/review/rw8532860/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2021,jannikpeveling,3," Romantic comedy that isn't funny or romantic
",It is a really bad sign when a romantic comedy isn't funny or romantic at all and you feel rather embarassed than amused or emotional. Maybe they just had to assign it to a genre so they can release it. I had low expectation and just wanted to watch a simple rom-com. But this one was worse even with no expectations.,/review/rw8532860/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2023,nerdydad1,7," surprisingly good, nice twist on the ""pretend to be couple"" trope.
","The ""pretend to be a couple and then actually fall in love"" trope has been done many times. But Love Jacked manages to inject some different elements, and made for an enjoyable movie.",/review/rw8532860/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2021,pellydolly,1," Know and use the right facts and information
","Africa is a continent of 55 countries, islands and disputed territories. This information is readily available online, the writer, producer, director and whoever could have researched this. Which country in Africa did Maya visit-just 1 country so why not mention the name of that particular country instead of mentioning Africa throughout. The name of the so called country should have been used. Advice don't portray and put information out that you don't know. Do your homework. This is a really bad movie filled with wrong and inappropriate information",/review/rw8532860/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,SafariPlum,1," What went wrong here?
","This movie has the ingredients for a very funny romantic comedy. Keith David playing Ed Johnson, Mike Epps playing the wacky Afrophile Uncle Rufus and Amber Stevens West playing the fed up daughter Maya. This great cast together with this storyline could and should make something really fantastic, funny and memorable. So what went wrong?",/review/rw8532860/?ref_=tt_urv
