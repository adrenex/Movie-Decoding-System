22 December 2002,LebowskiT1000,9," Disturbing subject matter, yet a great film!
","I'll never forget first seeing this film in the theater.  When I heard that this film was written by the same writer as ""Seven"", I expected a truly sick and twisted film.  Now don't get me wrong, this most certainly is a sick and twisted film, but it wasn't nearly as graphic as I expected.  Maybe that is due to this film having a different director, but nonetheless the film wasn't as graphic as I'd expected.  With that said, and having watched this film a number of times, I still wouldn't recommend this film to everyone. If you like thrillers and can handle the subject of pornography and ""snuff"" films, then you should definitely give this film a chance.",/review/rw1216874/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2007,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," Very gritty and dark
","When I watched 8 MM, I didn't know what to expect, but I noticed that Joel Schumacher directed it and I am a fan of his. Also it stars two other terrific actors like Nicholas Cage and Joaquin Phoenix, so usually that equals a great film. 8 MM turned out to be a terrific dark drama that I'm not so sure that I understand it's low rating. I was actually expecting it to be in the 7.0 range when I went to check it out on IMDb, but it's in the low 6.0's. I understand that it's an extremely dark movie that not too many people would wanna take a look at, but for what it was, I thought it was great. It took us into the deep dark world of porn and what some sick people get off on. It's not just about that, but also it takes us into a detective type of drama that makes it into a scary type of thriller.",/review/rw1216874/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2008,jzappa,8," An Voyeuristic Thriller About Human's Capacity For Evil
","There is a lot to be said about skill. Joel Schumacher is responsible for Batman & Robin, one of the most horrendously made movies in the past 15 years. One could have said upon leaving the theater in 1997 that Joel Schumacher is one of the worst directors working today. Two years later, Schumacher creates something, albeit with commercial sensibilities, that succeeds on many levels. 8mm is a murky, scuzzy passage through the miserable, dystopian criminal world of snuff films, taken on by a private investigator who is dismayed and scarred by what he unearths. It probes the resources of violent exploitation films, but not as a violent exploitation film. It would more accurately turn your stomach than amuse. Andrew Kevin Walker, who wrote Seven, and again establishes a protagonist who confronts evil and nearly loses his sanity in an effort to understand its reasons. The answer comes almost at the end of the film, from its most vicious character, but his rationale wittingly refrains from going as deep as the psychological world of his deeds. Joel Schumacher has an attraction to sinister, perhaps Gothic environments, even if his previous films that follow that pattern aren't so great, like The Lost Boys. Here, with Mychael Danna's sorrowful score and the great Robert Elswit's guilty, peeping camera, he fashions an impression of apprehension even in the few scenes where the story takes solace in Cage's home life. One director would not be wrong to shock us with a comparison to the unsuspecting atmosphere of Cage's residential street or the opening airport shot, but Schumacher perceives the looming subterranean goings-on beneath the unsuspecting.",/review/rw1216874/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2012,BA_Harrison,9," Hard to believe this came from the director of Batman and Robin.
","Despite a lack of concrete evidence to support its existence, the snuff movie has endured for decades as an urban legend simply because the idea is so perversely intriguing and downright plausible; surely someone, somewhere has been murdered on film purely for the purpose of entertainment. This is the central theme of Joel Schumacher's 8MM, a thrilling descent into the grimy world of extreme pornography which sees Nicolas Cage as private detective Tom Welles, who is hired by a wealthy widow to find out whether a reel of film found in her late husband's safe is really what it appears to be—a snuff movie!",/review/rw1216874/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2000,mwpressley,8," Disturbing, effective film
","8MM is a very dark, disturbing film that isn't for everyone. Nicolas Cage puts in an excellent performance as a private detective named Tom Welles who is hired to investigate whether a snuff film is real or acted.  His journey takes him farther and farther into the realm of pornography. Every minute of this film is suspenseful and riveting.  I also found Joaquin Phoenix's performance to be outstanding as well.  This movie does a wonderful job of creating a dark mood and exploring the motives and drives behind its characters.  One of Cage's best, and a severely under-rated film.",/review/rw1216874/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2006,ccthemovieman-1,6," Beware Of Brutal Topic
","Wow, this is a tough subject but not as sordid a film as I figured it would be, although be warned the last 30 minutes are really rough in spots. Speaking of spots, this is a bloody movie in spots, too and very profane after the first 40 minutes. Yet, despite the unpleasant nature of the story (making a ""snuff film"" - filming the killing of people) it's a riveting one, well-acted and doesn't overdo the violence. The characters in here are some of the most despicable you could find - killer and porn kings.",/review/rw1216874/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2006,MarieGabrielle,8," A similar formula....
","used about five to seven years ago; this film may remind you of ""Se7en"" in that it exposes ways of life some would rather not see, admit to or acknowledge. Also the movie ""The Cell"" used exactly the same soundtrack when we see the Vincent D'Onofrio character as an abused child.",/review/rw1216874/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2002,DJ Inferno,7," A solid thriller!
","Some sensitive-minded people may surely be disturbed by the dark revenge and self-justice in this film, but ""Se7en""-author Andrew Kevin Walker has done another fine work with his script! Although the storyline is obviously taken from Paul Schrader´s ""Hardcore"" (1974,?) the film is suspense-packed, violent and endowed with good performances of its actors, especially Peter Stormare did a brilliant job with playing the weird bondage-porn director Dino Velvet! I also was truly surprised how good director Joel Schumacher had created a morbid atmosphere, just in unhappy memory of his disastrous ""Batman & Robin""-flick..! Another pleasant fact is, that ""8MM"" doesn´t deal with the Hollywood-typical stereotypes and clichés, so finally we´ve got something we could really call a dirty mainstream production - or at least a nice try of it!",/review/rw1216874/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2009,moviesleuth2,7," Not for the faint of heart
","When it came out, ""8mm"" became notorious for its dark and perverted subject matter. Any and all warnings that are given in association with this film are warranted: this is a dark, dark, thriller, and one that revels in a lot of sordid subject matter. How this was never threatened with an NC-17 is beyond me.",/review/rw1216874/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2009,Matt_Layden,7," One Of Schumacher's Better Efforts.
","Every time I think of Joel Schumacher I cringe. Is Batman & Robin really so bad that it makes me want to disregard the rest of his films? He's not a bad director, hell I enjoy some of his work, yet I still cringe when I hear his name. Let's take a look at 8MM, something that is the polar opposite of B&R.",/review/rw1216874/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 1999,SKG-2,8," Disturbing
","Admittedly, I haven't seen a lot, if any, of the movies or read the books other people have said have covered this territory already, but I found myself caught up in the story and not bored or thinking, ""Ho-hum.""  I haven't liked Joel Schumacher lately(his two BATMAN movies were a joke, and A TIME TO KILL was exploitation at its worst), but this one was pretty good. Admittedly, like in A TIME TO KILL, this sometimes comes close to an exploitation movie(particularly through the performances of James Gandolfini and Peter Stormare), but that's only part of the time.  Most of the time you feel sadness and outrage, and like in Schumacher's very good FALLING DOWN, you aren't asked to condone Cage's actions near the end, you're just asked to understand them.",/review/rw1216874/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2015,SnoopyStyle,7," dark and creepy

27 December 2005,ninoguapo,8," One of best movies I have seen
","8MM is one of best movies I have seen. Nicolas Cage plays his role very good, which I expected having seen ""Lord or War ""recently. The plot is interesting and so are the dialogs between characters. There are quite a few tense moments in the movie  which is probably why I liked this movie that much.",/review/rw1216874/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2004,bealer,8," A dark, graphic view into the underworld of pornography
","Firstly, this film is hugely under-rated. For those reviewers who call this film a ""waste of time"" or place it in the ""hall of shame"", maybe they should go back to watching more obvious and simple films. ",/review/rw1216874/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 1999,Viper2,," Well made, but disturbing. Watch with care.
","I walked into the movie theater last Friday not expecting at all what I was about to see. I'd heard about it, thought ""Oh, another Seven"". Same screenwriter, but I was way off track. I can stomach a lot, having no problem stuffing down popcorn during very graphic scenes. In 8MM, my coke had trouble going down. 8MM did not have consistent gory/violent scenes, but the way the movie was made made you fill in the blanks of what the makers of the movie could not screen. And if you pay attention and immerse yourself, you fill in more blanks than you really think you could, or want. As Max put it: ""the devil changes you."" The perversity and deep rottenness of the human minds displayed in 8MM is what disturbs you. Then you realize, that ""snuff""-movies are real, that there are individuals twisted enough to endorse/enjoy/take part in it. And worst of all, that these individuals don't look like monsters, they're perhaps just overweight nearsighted men who look like your dad, your son, your brother, even yourself. And if you don't look out,(no matter how secluded you think you are in your suburban home, with a wife, a daughter, and a dog named Shep) you dive into the pit of perversion and rottenness as well, finding no way out. In conclusion: excellent music, acting very sufficient, the plot: a must see. Just don't bring popcorn, and prepare to walk out of the movie theatre disturbed, asking questions, and a little bit more suspicious of those walking around you, and yourself.",/review/rw1216874/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2012,Hey_Sweden,7," A descent into depravity.
","This effectively somber and seedy drama plays somewhat like the George C. Scott film ""Hardcore"" of 20 years previous. There's no denying that it gets pretty grim and ugly, so it's not for all tastes, and will be hard for some viewers to take.",/review/rw1216874/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 1999,jeff-8,," A Haunting and disturbing Brilliant Realistic Masterpiece!!
","The intensely intriguing storyline of 8MM follows the haunting search by a private investigator (played superbly by Nicolas Cage) for the makers of a grotesque and disturbing snuff film in which a young woman is murdered. Starting by looking through endless missing persons files (in an attempt to identify the victim), Cage ultimately follows leads to the world of underground seaze films and the people who are involved in making them. Throughout his creepy investigation, Cage becomes more and more disturbed by the Snuff film and stops at nothing in an attempt to track down answers to what really happened.  This film is So intriguing and suspenseful, there are scenes that will leave your heart pounding in anticipation of what's to come.  I don't know if I have ever seen such an intriguing and suspenseful Drama/Thriller ever before!  This film is so realistic, there are times when you feel as if what is going on is real, and you begin to feel more for the characters than you usually do in a film.  The last 20 minutes of the film are heart pounding and breathtaking!  Director Joel Schumacher delivers one of the most mind haunting dramas you will ever see and gives us a story that won't be easy to forget.  It's dark, moody, creepy, brilliant, and disturbing!  And when all the pieces finally come together, you'll be glad you went along for the ride.  Wow, It's a sick world we live in!!  I give this movie 4 out of 4 stars!",/review/rw1216874/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2015,anaconda-40658,9," Watch the Film.
","Eight Millimeter (1999): Dir: Joel Schumacher / Cast: Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, Peter Stormare, James Gandofini, Anthony Heald: Title suggests a small object displaying the most vile evidence to the dark side of the human mind. Nicolas Cage plays a detective sent to view an eight millimeter film displaying a teenage girl butchered for sexual pleasure. When the girl is listed as missing he visits her mother and eventually embarks upon the grim reality of snuff pornography. His investigation leads to the minds that manifest them but Cage makes an unsettling decision towards the conclusion after a phone call. Director Joel Schumacher does a tense portrayal of the horrors of snuff films. It presents a stronger argument than his overrated A Time to Kill. Outstanding job by Cage who makes a tearful phone call where questions are presented and viewers are left to ponder the justification. Joaquin Phoenix works in an adult video store where his nature isn't as stereotypical as it first seems. He will assist Cage with information until fatality kicks in. Disturbing performances by Peter Stormare, Anthony Heald and James Gandolfini who represent the corrupt society at its most unlawful and sadistic. Dire facts presented when a leather mask is removed and the film's real message is revealed. This is wear appearances are deceiving when our eyes and minds have familiar expectations. Score: 9 / 10",/review/rw1216874/?ref_=tt_urv

30 October 2002,Rhino-1,8," Fantastic!!
","8MM was a very dark and powerful film featuring the seedy underground world of pornography and snuff movies. It was, to be frank, fantastic. Nic Cage, rapidly becoming one of my favourite actors, walks through with a disgusted air and even Joaquin Phoenix, who I've never been that impressed with, hit the nail as a porn shop manager",/review/rw1216874/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2002,Anonymous_Maxine,8," Dark and disturbing, yes, but it should also be clearly noted that 8MM avoids, for the most part, the almost always destructive influence of Hollywood.
","8MM is a dark, disturbing movie. It's literally dark due to the low lighting, it has a mesmerizing but undeniably creepy score, the performances from everyone involved are subdued and sinister, and the subject matter, above all, is not exactly uplifting. It is not surprising, then, that many people are going to leave this movie with a disgusted feeling, thinking that they have been tricked into watching a movie that left them feeling badly. On the one hand, it should be noted that 8MM was never exactly advertised as light entertainment, but even more importantly, all of the dark elements above go together very smoothly, even if not very happily. 8MM, it cannot be denied, is simply a dark movie, and the way I see it, there is no reason that that alone should count against it.

","Yet another one of those films that was critically panned but enjoyed a somewhat better reception from audiences, ""8MM"" is a fascinating little film from way back in 1999.
