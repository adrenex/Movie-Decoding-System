15 November 2013,Amari-Sali,9," The Best Man Holiday delivers a dramedy which reminds you why the 90s/ early 00s were a renaissance for Black films.
","I have probably watched the first movie, The Best Man, at least 5 to 6 times since it came out. It was funny, presented new angles for Black actors, and though Christianity, as with most Black films, was in there, it wasn't overdone. As for the sequel, it is rare to get a whole cast to return when more than a decade has passed, and truly I think, when it comes to original movies and not ones based off someone who was alive, this is the best film featuring a Black majority cast in a while.",/review/rw3063729/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2013,day_dae,8," I'm Sure You Heard the Phrase, ""Grown Folk's Business""
","Best Man's Holiday, is a timely-well written and acted movie. It touches on so many social issues people are going through in the now. It is surprising how emotional involved you will be caught up in scenes. It's a roller coaster of highly amusing moments on second, followed by an altar call of your conscience reflecting on unresolved past issues the next. The movie will have you unexpectedly grabbing for popcorn salt covered napkins to use on tear ducts, then laughing so hard followed with, ""what if -, thank you, goodness (smirk),you have got to be kidding me and oh YES (I know that's right),"" moments. And then more need of those crumpled salt and oil napkins you discarded in the empty popcorn bowl.",/review/rw3063729/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2013,judywalker2,8," Surprisingly funny and heartwarming.
","I am African American but I don't usually go to the typical Black movies because I find them too heavily silly, religious and manipulative so I was surprised as how funny and heartwarming Best Man's Holiday was. I really loved seeing all of these beautiful Black men and women getting together and celebrating their ups and downs. Terrance Howard was great, I never thought he could be so funny. It was great seeing Nina Long and Sanaa Latham who are great actresses and don't get enough screen time (Hollywood just don't tap its Black talent like it should). Morris Chestnut was also great and Taye Diggs (that's not to say that Howard Perrineau, Monica Calhoun and Melissa De Sousa weren't good because they were). Yes this movie is predictable and in some places overly preachy but you'll have a fun time and that's what movies are for.",/review/rw3063729/?ref_=tt_urv

","I know that I am late to party. I missed the movie in the theater. I just watched it on HBO. OMG Terrance Howard was hilarious. Morris Chestnut was just yummy. The ladies and the rest of the cast were superb as well. I loved the holiday music. I had to stop the movie to go blow my nose because I was crying so much. By now, you probably know what I'm talking about.",/review/rw3063729/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am a heavy moviegoer and have NEEEEVER wrote in the message section about a movie before. This movie was well written n delivered excellence in every way. Acting performances were outstanding to a perfect 20 out of 10. Felt real as if a camera was just following them the entire time. Everyone involved in the making of this movie has raised d bar so high low minded individuals will low ball this merely because they share opaque mindsets N don't understand!!!!! Too many times black movies get low rating because I simply believe the folks who are rating them do not understand the lifestyle of beomg an African American. Therefore if its not stereo typical, then it s don't make sense.",/review/rw3063729/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2013,sches26,10," Quality with no Quantity
","To sum it up the movie didn't get any support financially (according to the news sources and cast) and the cast, directors, and writers produced a great movie. It was refreshing to me to see black people portrayed as successful professionals.I loved the story and being able to follow the characters.t connected with people on so many levels not just the African American audience. People black or white will always go out and support great quality movies. I hear a lot of people bringing up color in discussions about this movie. The truth is I did go to see the movie because it was an all black cast. I also went because I knew the actors involved were serious about their craft. At the end of the day the only color that matters is green, and they deserve the green for a job well done. I can't wait until the DVD comes out! To everyone that made this film happen: thank you for fighting for quality movie despite the obstacles and lack of funds compared to other movies that came out ....",/review/rw3063729/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 2013,happycalamity,7," Best Man holiday... get your Kleenex ready *spoilers*
","The Best Man Holiday is a sequel to The Best Man 1999, which centered on actors Lance (Morris Chestnut) and Mia (Monica Calhouns) wedding. Where Harper (Taye Diggs) is Lance's best man in that movie it surfaced that Harper had written a book about the couple as well as their friends from college. In the book harpers character sleeps with Mia's character when Lance puts two and two together he is furious the wedding almost doesn't happen. But he ends up forgiving Mia because he had cheated on her several times before. Any way The Best Man Holiday is based 15 years after the events of Best Man. In The Best Man Holiday Lance and Harper are not friends they are polite but that is only because they have mutual friends you get the impression harper hasn't seen Mia or Lance in years. Harper is on hard times his wife is pregnant he has lost his job and hasn't written anything good in years. So when he gets Mia's invite he sees it as an opportunity to get the inside scoop on Lances biography. Hilarity ensues for the next 40 minutes while the whole gang gets back together at Lances mansion for the holidays. Then there is a sudden shift and the movie that was advertised as a comedy changes completely. There is a major bomb shell dropped on the audience and from there on out there are very few jokes mostly tears up until the end of the movie. Alright now on to the individual characteristics acting was good very emotional and believable performances from each of the actors the movie really thrives off the group dynamic and the s@*t talk between the men and women. Cinematography is pretty standard nothing new just your basic romantic dramedy. Story wise it doesn't feel like the movie gives you the story that they advertised. This movie was marketed as a laugh out loud comedy and it was until about 40 minutes in then it did a screaming 180 towards drama and tears. It was a strong albeit cliché story but I left the movie feeling sadder than uplifted as I usually feel after a good comedy. Overall if you want a cliché story with some good bits of humor but an overarching feeling of sadness this is for you.",/review/rw3063729/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2017,davispittman,9," A great film that blends comedy and drama
","The Best Man Holiday (2013), which is a follow up to The Best Man (1999), is a very well made film. Some say that sequels are cursed or whatever, but that is definitely not the case with this sequel. It boasts a great cast, which includes: Morris Chestnut, Taye Diggs, Sanaa Lathan, Nia Long, Terrance Howard, and more. They all give fantastic performances, especially Diggs and Chestnut. Chemistry is another big thing here, because truthfully a movie such as this one can't work at all without good onscreen chemistry. The connections these characters have with one another, the friendships and romances, are all shown in a raw way, and it works so well. Your attention is aure to be held all the way through, I know mine was. The writing is funny when it needs to be, and it's beautiful and dramatic when it needs to be. This holiday film comes highly suggested, I had never seen the original 1999 film, but now I am encouraged to go do so. 9/10 for The Best Man Holiday.",/review/rw3063729/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2013,kasabre28,10," What a great movie
","This movie really came full circle. I laughed, I cried, then laughed some more. felt like I was on a roller coaster of emotion, but in a very good way, both the story and the characters were so well developed. This movie really taps into what friendship and forgiveness, and love should be I could relate to something about all the characters. Even the title is perfect because the message is so deep that it renews life's true meaning at a time when we are in the middle of the most materialistic holiday of the year. This movie really brought me back, and reminded me of my blessings, what a great message for us all Thank you 10 stars ...Go see it",/review/rw3063729/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2015,filmfanperspective,8," Feels like time spent with old friends (****)
","A harsh pinch of my arm as the lights dimmed reminded me that I was, indeed, awake. 1999's ""The Best Man"", one of the more under- appreciated and well-made films about friendships and relationships I've ever seen, got a sequel. More than anything, it intrigues me that a modern-day studio would greenlight this film and designate it for wide release. Perhaps since the popularity of the leads has reasonably increased over the years, they felt comfortable enough. I shouldn't worry either way about why this exists, and simply be thankful that it does. This is a well-made, humorous, emotional, logical, and sensual film, succeeding on every level. The filmmakers care so much about the characters that we can't help but care for them as well. If not for a slight misstep towards the end, I'd consider ""The Best Man Holiday"" to be one of the best films of the year.",/review/rw3063729/?ref_=tt_urv

","Can't believe it's been 14 years - in real time. The actors look fantastic and still have their characters locked in. Can't wait to see the next Best Man offering, evidently filmed at the same time to save on costs. Good idea.",/review/rw3063729/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2014,tedrico,10," Another Teddy Flix Movie Review: ""Best Man Holiday (2013)""
","Emotion Packed, Heart-felt, BLACK DRAMA AT IT'S FINEST! Shot primarily in Toronto, Canada ... this film truly felt like a Christmas Movie! If you aren't choking and tearing up by the 1 hr. 45 min. mark of this film, you may need to check if you are still human! This film far surpasses that of it's original 1998 prequel in every category ... for within ""The Best Man Holiday"" exists tension, strife, rivalry, haughty looks, lust, faith, belief, hope, seeking, miracles, jealousy, envy, ... did I say strife ... LOL! But despite all of the things the spirit of God flows throughout the film from start to finish! I'd like to see this kind of directing in all Black films, for Malcom D Lee shows us that not only can he make us laugh hysterically, as in ""Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins"", ... but he can also make us cry as I did and I'm sure, a vast majority of viewers have & will. The music score in this film rates A+ and the cast members selected for this sequel could not be a more perfect selection. Terrance Howard's comedy, wit, and sarcasm is an added plus towards helping us, the viewers, return from a state of tears, back to a state of laughter. I rate this film 5 of 5 stars.",/review/rw3063729/?ref_=tt_urv

","Excellent movie! Excellent cast! It's a sequel so if you haven't seen the first movie you shouldn't be rating it! They did a great job of bringing the characters back that we love & in Grand fashion! This Series is a African American Cult Classic. To give an example.This cast is ""The Breakfast Club"" for African Americans & we are just happy to see them all back together again! The movie being good is just an extra bonus! The acting in this movie is very good & you will laugh & be sent to tears then back to laughter! It's not just a chick flick either. They definitely have some scenes that are just for the men It's amazing to me how everyone almost looks better that they looked in the first movie! I Guess black doesn't crack...LOL!

","I did not see much of The Best Man(1999), But I was really interested in seeing this film after seeing the trailer.

","I started watching this movie thinking it was another black comedy (I love those) so I was a bit disappointed because there where not a lot of funny scenes (though Terrence Howard was funny as hell). After I realized it wasn't a laugh your ass off comedy there was a lot more drama. I must say that in the end I really enjoyed watching this, it just took me a moment to switch.",/review/rw3063729/?ref_=tt_urv

This story was deeply moving and the transitions and transformations of some of the characters was very endearing. The way the friendships move in and out in natural progression was, dare I say, realistic in nature.",/review/rw3063729/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2015,trudystillbottom,1," Another Movie About Horrible People
","I sure hope that all you guys giving this movie high ratings don't have friends like the characters depicted in this movie or think that this is normal friendship. The characters in this movie are loud, selfish, self-centered, narcissistic, brash, conniving, immoral, inappropriate around children, childish, unintelligent, underhanded, and bullish. And that just describes the first ten minutes. It is difficult to watch a drama where no one is appealing or likable. There is no one to root for in his movie. Is it bad if you just want the house they are all staying in to burn to the ground while they are all sleeping? Although you could show it to your children so they can see first hand how ugly all this behavior will make you look as an adult. Beautiful house, beautiful actors, and beautiful clothes cannot hide the ugliness pervasive in this movie.",/review/rw3063729/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2014,tamashere,10," Best Ever!! My new favorite of all time!
","Wow, how is it that a sequel can be better than the first?! Fabulous director, cast and storyline is the answer. Amazing! This is the absolute best movie I have seen in an extremely long time. I laughed, cried, was totally blown away and really needed this. The cast feels like family and that made all the difference in the world. Granted it was devastating with Mia's passing, but so great to see they kept faith and God throughout the storyline. I so appreciate that there was no fear in showing how we can have faith in God despite the circumstances. His understanding will always be so much greater than our own but we must never stop trusting Him. Malcolm D. Lee, you are brilliant! Can't wait to see what you come up with next and DEFINITELY can't wait for another Best Man movie! What, Quentin's getting married?! Set it up for the next one!
