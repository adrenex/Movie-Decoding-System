15 March 2021,Mivas_Greece,7," The sequel of Transformers is improved in direction, cinematography, effects, action, plot, duration, transformers, but is worse in seriousness compared to the 1st one.
","Fantasy/action movie. The sequel to Bay's great franchise, Transformers. The 2nd film further enhances the action, the effects, but also the overall budget, since we are transported to the desert and foreign countries. Also, Steve Jablonsky's excellent selection in the music of the film and in the songs the top New Divide from Linkin Park continues. The second film is longer in plot and duration than the first, but Bay's lack of seriousness is also unfortunately reinforced in this film. He also makes reference to another of his great film, Bad Boys 2, through a large poster in the film, while in the first he mentioned the Armageddon. The threat of bigger, and more dangerous transformers, and generally all the elements are improved in this film, only overall it is less serious than the first, especially in dialogues and some characters. Better in action, effects, directing, but inferior in dialogues, so it remains at the levels of the first, perhaps a little below, but for different reasons.",/review/rw5528208/?ref_=tt_urv

","Too much comic relief undermines the dramatic impact of director Michael Bay's visually impressive sequel ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."" If you skipped the original live-action ""Transformers,"" you may not understand the stakes in the sequel or the situation. The original concluded with the treacherous Decepticon jet Transformer streaking off into the sky, guaranteeing the survival of the villains. Original ""Transformer"" scenarists Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman are joined on this installment by ""Reindeer Games"" writer Ehren Kruger and they bring back the evil Decepticons for a rematch with the virtuous Autobots.

11 April 2021,adamjohns-42575,6," A good sequel
","I personally think that this one is slightly better than the first, because it doesn't have to establish all of the characters. Having said that, the story is a bit lacking and I really had to pay attention to try to understand what was going on at times. There could have been a bit more of the every day Sam to counteract the more apocalyptic elements and give a bit of balance. It all happens very fast.",/review/rw5528208/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2020,airviun,8," Great film about robots, people and their interaction
","Transformers was my favorite cartoon when I was a child and surely I couldn't pass by films about transformers. This is the second film in the series and it's better than the first one. It's more focused, has more interesting story and certainly it has some fun and hilarious moments. The only downside is that it has a little to much action and fighting and sometimes it's hard to tell what's happening on the screen. The most memorable moment is probably when a pretty blonde girl seduces the main character and transforms into a very unpleasant robot. Surprisingly this film has some very touching moments. It's a bit long, but never dull and almost always interesting.",/review/rw5528208/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2013,lesleyharris30,7," Not as Fresh as the Original,but Still an Enjoyable Sequel,
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a good movie with a pretty good storyline and an average cast.Its definitely not as enjoyable as the first Transformers and it goes on too long,also an awful lot of the movie is very long action sequences,that go on for so long that after a while you don't even know whats going on.Shia Labeouf is just as good as the first,but Megan Fox is probably worse,I didn't like her in the first and I didn't like her in this,she is very attractive that is clearly the only reason she makes it in such big movies,because she can not act.Like the first my favourite actors are definitely the voice actors,they do a very impressive job voicing these strong characters,and the addition of the small auto it's was very humorous and added as a good comic relief.Fans of the first Transformers will be disappointed,but Revenge of the Fallen is still a good sequel.

","Following the success of the first TRANSFORMERS, a sequel was announced for a summer 2009 release, but had to go through a lot before it was released and the Writers' Strike was one of them and the film received almost negative reviews from critics.",/review/rw5528208/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2010,disdressed12,10," a more complete movie than the first
","while i gave the first movie a 10/10 for sheer entertainment,this sequel is actually a more complete film,in my opinion,as much as this type of movie can be.for one thing,the story is actually much more interesting and more developed.the humour quotient is upped in this one as well.there are quite a few chuckles.some of the transformers are really neat,especially on the Decepticon side.the fight scenes between the Transformers are quite spectacular,though that isn't surprising.what is surprising is that the transformation scenes(when the vehicles change into their robot forms and vice versa were not seamless,and looked herky jerky to me.in the original film,this was not an issue.still,it's immensely entertaining.and despite a few minor issue.a better movie overall.as an aside,the movie is nominated for a Razzie Award for worst movie,which mystifies me.it's nowhere near Razzie calibre.oh,well.for me,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a 10/10",/review/rw5528208/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2020,briancham1994,7," Decent way to pass the time
","Yes, this film is incredibly stupid and loud, but that's what you are getting yourself into. It's a purely entertaining popcorn blockbuster with exciting action and not much of a plot. For sure, the jokes are dumb and not much makes sense, but if you just want to pass the time, this film is a good way to do it.",/review/rw5528208/?ref_=tt_urv

18 August 2020,maxglen,6," Amps up the action at the cost of almost everything else.
","I'll start by saying this film has FANTASTIC action sequences, better than the first even. Problem is, everything that made the first film so decent is basically gone here. The story is extremely formulaic and not really gripping in any way. Useless scenes and subplots are sprinkled throughout, especially during the college portions of the film. Shia does a good job as Sam once again but the rest of the original cast are either sidelined or written so badly you don't really care about them anymore. Megan Fox is especially exploited in this film, similar to the first Transformers but much more sleazily. Speaking of sleaze, the edgy humour of the first has carried over but where in that film it was fun, it has been toned up to borderline vulgarity. This film also adds quite a few new characters, some are cool, most are annoying and a handful are blatantly offensive. I'd give this film a 4 but the action really is worth a couple points. It's more of the first film but better, it's just a shame it's in a less consistent package than the first movie. Strong 5 to a light 6 from me.",/review/rw5528208/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2011,TheLittleSongbird,6," Some aspects could have done with much more work, but it is not that bad
","I quite liked the first Transformers and this film. Neither of the Transformers films are masterpieces, but neither are terrible movies either in my opinion. And yes, this is coming from a fan of the 1984 series and 1986 movie. Transformers 2:Revenge of the Fallen is not the best of the year, but it is a long way from the worst either(not like The Ugly Truth or Dragonball Evolution). And is it the worst movie of all time as I have seen in some reviews and various message boards? For me, not even close.",/review/rw5528208/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2014,user-543-975655,7," Epic
","Because Transformers 4: Age of Extinction is coming out in less than a month, I decided to re-watch some of the older Transformers movies. After re-watching the first movie, I decided to review it (feel free to check that review out). Then, I thought it would be good to review all of the Transformers movies, which is why I am reviewing this. The Transformers series really is awesome, and it is one of my Top 5 favorite series. Shia Labeouf and Megan Fox really are a good couple in the movie, and they fit together perfectly, so they were great casting choices. Every other main casting choice was great, such as Josh Duhamel as Lennox, and Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime. Everyone in the movie was great, however, and all played a believable part, and displayed their emotions and delivered their lines without a single problem or malfunction. One problem I had with the first movie was that the camera was extremely shaky during some of the battles. Sure, the recurring slow motion shots helped, but not all the time. There was not a shaky camera in this installment, and that really made me happy. The camera did a lot of cool angles, such as when they rotate around the action, or battles. Which were amazing except for one thing. Sure, the special effects were fantastic, and the battles were extremely entertaining. However, they were only entertaining when there were just 4-5 Transformers and a bunch of people at max. But there were some scenes where there were so many people and Transformers that I could not tell who was who. After you spend half of the battle figuring that out, they are really fun to watch. The special effects in the Transformers movies really are awesome, though. The Autobots and Decepticons look so great that they are even more believable than they would be if they were cheesy. The voice actors are so great in this movie, and all of the voice actors were perfect choices for the Transformers, which made them very fun to watch. The robots such as Mudflap and his twin added a lot of good humor to the film, as well. On to the music. The music was very good, and some of it was taken from the original Transformers, such as a song called Arrival to Earth, by Steve Jablonsky. Jablonsky made such good music for this movie, which is awesome because music is one of the most important parts of a movie. The setting varies greatly from the first movie, which is refreshing so it isn't like we are seeing the same battles again. The only reason I gave this movie only a 7 is because it is so long. Some of the scenes drag out way too much, and there were about five boring parts. The story also differs, which is good. The writers still used some of the objects in the first movie such as Energon and the AllSpark cube. There were new objects and new Transformers in this movie, which made it a lot better, too. That's all I have to say about Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Thanks for reading. See ya!",/review/rw5528208/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2020,jakob-berge,10," Too much juvenile and distracting humour, but the visual work and action thrills makes up for it.
","The second one of the robots in disguise, Transformers: Revenge of the fallen is an interesting one. This one was made during the writer's strike in Hollywood. The movie had lots of shooting and production without a proper script. And you could say it shows and it is not a good movie. But it still made 836 million dollars at the global box office which is nothing but impressive. This movie was the one that made the most domestically in USA (402 mill) out of the 5.",/review/rw5528208/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2016,trooper5783,9," The one Transformers movie that's good.
","I actually saw this movie at a generally filled theater in Virginia around early July of 2009, a tad bit after it's official release in late June. I was 8 years old and I liked the first Transformers, although not as much as my brother, who was 6 at the time, who was a huge fanatic of all sorts of robots and creatures fighting in the Saturday morning cartoons, and he was extremely pumped, but I wasn't too excited, although I did think it looked like a good movie. I saw it with my family, and we loved it! I didn't know this got bad reviews at the time because I wasn't familiar with film critics, and I won't say it's perfect, but it's a great summer film in its own right. The action and special effects are extravagant, particularly the forest battle and whenever a computerized Transformer is interacting with a human character. But I'll say that some of the comedy maybe a little too awkward to watch with families, in addition, the Leo character wasn't important nor funny in the slightest. Other than a couple of small problems, ROTF is a ton of fun for Transformers fans and action movie fans.",/review/rw5528208/?ref_=tt_urv

23 August 2009,Robert_duder,8," A sequel was a must but it was just a step too far
","This was probably my most anticipated film of the summer season so expectations were definitely high. The first film was mind blowing action and launch the opportunity for an incredible series of films. I think in part legendary action director and producer Michael Bay has a very specific recipe for action that seems to always work so in his mind the ultimate sequel would simply be more of everything that made the first installment incredible and that doesn't necessarily make for the perfect follow up. Plus I think the first Transformers was so stunning because for the first time ever you were seeing the legendary toy/cartoon characters in larger than life reality but now the novelty of that has worn off. Transformers 2 is still great, loads of fun, some incredible battles, familiar characters and a welcome sequel but indeed does not surpass or really even touch the original film. The biggest probably with the film, and I've heard this voiced by other critics, is that there are just SO MANY robots. Most of the time you have no idea who is who rather than keeping to the core group. The only Transformer I could pinpoint at any one time was Optimus Prime, even Megatron blended with some of the others.",/review/rw5528208/?ref_=tt_urv
