30 July 2022,nunya6552,7," I'm confused by the ""woke"" reviews
","Why are people calling this show ""woke"" and insisting it's a liberal agenda? Is it cause the main character is black and married to a white man? I'm so confused.",/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2022,saysjenn,8," Intriguing Story
",I just finished the show and do hope for a season two. The story is a psychological mystery thriller and lives up to this throughout the season. It will have you guessing who is guilty and who is innocent and what are the motives behind everyone. There are lots of moving parts and a slow but steady build that left me wanting more. I really hope we get a season two as there are a lot of things left unknown and we the audience deserve to see this one through to the very end.,/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,imysterious,," ppl only calling this WOKE coz it has a black protagonist
",There is literally no other reason to call this WOKE as this show doesn't touch any political or social issues even for a microsecond.,/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,Nevergivea10,4," Not woke but not good
","First, so far, there is not a single thing woke about this series. If there was, I'd be the first to say it. Remember the""boy who cried wolf?"" Well don't be the boy who cried woke or you lose your credibility.",/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2022,aimee925,6," You've seen this before
","This isn't terrible but also not great, and certainly not original. In fact, you'll probably have the story figured out within the first few minutes, but if you have nothing else to watch, I can think of a lot worse options out there (like anything on broadcast channels, For all Mankind, and Invasion comes to mind.)",/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2022,leh0287,9," Quietly mysterious
","I'm not sure why so many people dislike this show, but I think it's great! It feels like reading a good domestic mystery. I also don't know why people are saying this show is woke. There are many shows where I could use that description, but this isn't one of them. So far, I'm a fan! I'd recommend for anyone who loves a good domestic thriller, cozy mystery, etc.",/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2022,Ripshin,," I managed to watch it all.
","Somewhat of a convoluted mess. It requires a second season to make sense, and I will be surprised if it receives one. There is quite a bit of filler material. This could have been an interesting two-hour movie, minus the pointless padding.",/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,Shataraarrington7511,9," I'm invested!
",Maybe I'm biased because I love Gugu! I don't understand the bad reviews! I'm only on the second episode but so far so good for me! I'm truly invested in this show! I can't wait to see what happens next!,/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,gpageau1,7," It was entertaining and well acted, but would have made a better movie
",I thought the lead female and male where both excellent actors. Don't listen to all the crazies about this movie being woke. Not a clue what they are talking about. Unless you don't like a white man with a black woman. (We all know that's called something else...not woke) sad that a good show has crappy reviews. I enjoyed it. Especially since I didn't have to commit to a second season. It could have easily been a movie instead of a series though. It's worth the watch.,/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2022,goshamorrell,10," Amazing Story and acting
","Episode 1 of Surface starts with Sophie trying to piece her life together again after a horrific accident. She doesn't remember anything that happened and is suffering from panic attacks. Her therapist believes she should try neurofeedback, which is a new form of therapy. Now, the story goes that Sophie jumped off a bridge and tried to kill herself. But if she has a perfect family and a good job...why would she do that? AppleTV Originals tend to fall into two categories at the moment. Brilliant, absorbing TV and mediocre slogs. Surface is - so far at least - tumbling into the latter. The actual premise is so cliched and been done a million times in a litany of different genres and fields. The whole memory loss plot needs strong characters or a hook to really reel you in and Surface doesn't have that. Furthermore, some of the writing is sloppy which is quite surprising given Veronica West is the writer here. She has a pretty good track record with these sort of projects. But then the idea that a random coastguard just remembers every little detail of Sophie's case and she just so happens to pass this person out of everyone in the city is all kinds of contrivance central. Compounding these niggling issues further is the way Sophie's interpreting things in her life. Everything just feels... off. She doesn't vibe with her friends, her clothes are alien to her and a strange guy at a bar happens to be watching her. This man eventually confronts her, claiming that her husband, James, isn't being wholly truthful and implores them to talk in private. We later learn that this strange man is Officer Thomas Baden and he drops a matchstick box in her purse with an address. Ignoring that for now, Sophie heads back to work and checks out her file on the computer. There, she reads that she had no prior history of mental illness and was brought in with multiple fractures. Sophie was also put in an induced coma to control the swelling. It's clearly a horrific ordeal and no wonder Sophie doesn't remember it. However, there's also another part of this file that hints toward possible domestic violence too. When James leaves on a work trip, Sophie quizzes Caroline (her friend) over the cause of her broken arm. Apparently Sophie slipped and fell outside Chanel. But Sophie is not so sure. So what really happened?",/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,julieshotmail,5," Beautiful actress, beautiful cinematography, but extremely weak plot
","I am giving this 5 stars because the show does manage to make me anticipate when the next episode drops, and I watch it right away. That is mostly because of Gugu Mbatha-Raw, who is captivating in every role she does, from her part in ""Black Mirror"" to ""The Morning Show."" The series also features beautiful cinematography of the San Francisco landscape and interesting buildings. And the plot is mysterious enough that keeps you guessing. Unfortunately, after a watch of episode 8, you begin to remember all of the ridiculous plot holes, contrived scenes, and turn of events that do not quite make sense. None of the supporting actors are that memorable either. We have the husband played by an actor who is a poor man's Jake Gyllenhaal. Then the actress playing a Caroline is so bad; every scene she is in is cringe-worthy. I honestly do not know how she could have gotten a part opposite Gugu. So yes apparently there is a cliffhanger and a season 2 which I do not plan to watch at this point.",/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,karinahatem,3," No surface
","Well, this was a very slow burn, had to make a hard effort to watch all episodes. Boring and slow, it lacked all elements of suspense and mystery, also very poor performance from most of the actors, especially the cop character, who was very silly and lame. Weak plot, silly dialogue and too many holes in the story that didn't add up. Also, how about a major mistake trying to login to any Apple account, one gets an email notification after several attempts! Now sure how Apple let that one go. Another hole in the story, after several weeks, how was Sophie living and not noticing that she can't access and of her money ! Ending was ruined without revealing anything. Basically, this was pointless and meaningless tv show.",/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,silence-26,5," Disappointing
","I'm a fan of Mbatha-Raw. I'd probably watch just about anything with her. That said, ""Surface"" is pretty bad. I'm generously giving it a '5', mostly due to her welcome presence, but this is at best a 2nd or 3rd rate production. It's rare to hear dialogue that's this cliched outside of daytime soap operas, but they're hitting that mark here. A story about some ultra-wealthy pretty folks with problems is hardly ripe in this (almost or hopefully..) post-pandemic period. It's hard to even care one bit about these characters, or the very obvious story line. Surface is just a disappointing mess.",/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,zorroaca,5," Came Off the Rails Fast
",Things started to not add up in the first episode. How can a person not be overly intrigued when you go into a bar that you don't remember and the bartender pours you your usual??? How can a psychiatrist say... that what you are starting to remember before you lost your memory... is not important??? And how in the hell could Sophie be involved with the character Baden? The problem is that the script is not good enough to hold most to stay until the last episode which explains a lot of the whys... but then just leaves you hanging.,/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,grlym-46849,2," I gave it a try but it didn't a strike any interest
","So I tried this show, but to be honest it had a lot of time trying to recover in my mind as anything worthwhile once I saw that this was not a reboot of the show by the same name.",/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,mhelm-94734,6," Average to above average story. Good performances by the actors
","I too, I am perplexed as to why some reviewer's refer to this series as ""woke."" It must be because of the interracial marriage aspect of the two main characters, because I see no other sign of ""wokeness"" here. If it is just the interracial marriage aspect, then it's a sad commentary about the state of our culture today.",/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2022,canuckteach,7," 4 episodes, so so...
","Except I was sure it was over at 4! Not sure I will maintain my interest in the adorably pretty protaganist much longer. Six? Maybe.. 8? Definitely not. Actually, she's not beyond criticism herself: she restarts an affair with a murky undercover drug cop, in whom I have little faith (maybe HE tossed her off the boat?); to gain time & leverage, she cozies up to her husband only to run back to the cop.",/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,timetraveller8,6," Keeps you hanging.
",No doubt that this was a good story and the first episodes keep you interested. Unfortunately it appears as if the writers worried about a predictable ending and didn't know what to do for a finale.,/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv

5 August 2022,payiyugk,1," No thrill
","I have liked Gugu Mbatha-Raw since first seeing her in Larry Crowne. She is a beautiful lady and her acting seems good to me. But this film has no thrill, no mystery. I could care less about the storyline or the characters. This is not the actors fault. I just found the pacing to be far too slow and too boring. I never bought into the characters at all. Lots of jogging scenes. Not enough thrill or mystery. For those that enjoyed it I'm happy for you. I wish I had.",/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,alison-carlyle67,8," Interesting.
","So weird that people are calling this ""woke"" it isn't. It's about class, but I'm British, so maybe not as triggered. For me it's about memory and the part that plays in identity, that's why it's interesting.",/review/rw8400197/?ref_=tt_urv
