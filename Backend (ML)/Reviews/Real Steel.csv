11 January 2004,Smells_Like_Cheese,5," While pointless, it's still a fun movie
","Mr. Deeds, the remake of Mr. Deeds Goes To Town, Mr. Deeds Goes To Town is an old comedy that is personally one of my favorite comedies. It's just a wonderful film that I highly recommend you watch if you get the chance. So Adam Sandler decided to take on that classic and make it into his film, which honestly isn't that bad, just in comparison, believe me then you look at it as a horrendous film. It was just one of those movies that really didn't need a remake. But Adam Sandler did bring his own bite to the film and just updated the story for the younger generation that obviously never heard of the movie.",/review/rw3382411/?ref_=tt_urv

","Just watched this movie last night and the final verdict is: I loved it. Idk what all these other people be talking about. The character of Deeds is so incredibly likable and admirable and the film genuinely had me laughing in some points. Don't listen to the others hating on this film. Everyone should go watch it and decide for themselves because in my opinion, he film is genuinely super fun.",/review/rw3382411/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2006,ccthemovieman-1,7," Very Funny But ..........
","This, once again, has most of the earmarks of modern-day comedies: tons of sexual innuendos, lots of good laughs but many of them out of questionable lines or behavior, and a stupid, rushed ending that tries to make all the good guys win and the bad guys lose. The latter is fine - I want the good guys to prevail - but they way they go about it is stupid.",/review/rw3382411/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2008,g-bodyl,8," Sandler Has Done Better!
","This is the movie that Adam Sandler did the worst(the ones that I seen) and I still liked this film enough to write a positive review. The story is a remake from the 1936 version with Gary Cooper. Sandler plays Longfellow Deeds, a nice person with many friends. His uncle dies and he leaves forty billion dollars to his nephew, Deeds. Deeds travels to New York City to sign some papers. While in New York, he meets this beautiful woman. Little does he know that she is a reporter, not a school nurse. The script/storyline/jokes are bearable, but are better with most Sandler movies. I laughed a few times during the movie. Adam Sandler did a great job acting. Winona Ryder is a bit shaky in this role. John Turturro is hilarious as the butler who just sneaks up on everyone. I also have to mention Steve Buscemi as Crazy Eyes. That is what you call good comedy(referring to Crazy Eyes). There are some great songs to listen in this film. Overall, this is a good film but Sandler has done better films. I rate this movie 8/10.",/review/rw3382411/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2002,tfrizzell,," Stick With Capra's Version Instead.
","The remake to Frank Capra's 1936 masterpiece ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"" lacks the charm, heart and intelligence of that production. The titled character (Adam Sandler) inherits an outrageous fortune from a relative he did not even know about and New York opportunists led by the sleazy Peter Gallagher try to take advantage of Sandler's kindness and generosity towards others. Naturally Sandler is much smarter than he first appears and proves to be an individual that can handle swindlers. However he does let his guard down around supposed school nurse Winona Ryder (in actuality a reporter for a tabloid) and that is when his big-city troubles start. ""Mr. Deeds"" is a watchable and somewhat entertaining film that works because of Sandler's screen persona. Sandler continues to raise films that are duds just because of his enormous talents. The same is true with this one. Watch for ""Fargo"" alums Steve Buscemi and Harve Presnell as well as a long cameo from ex-tennis superstar John McEnroe. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",/review/rw3382411/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2002,=G=,6," See Ryder kiss Sandler!
","""Mr. Deeds"" tells of a wacky, naive small town guy, Mr. Deeds (Sandler), with little respect for fame or fortune who inherits $40 billion and has to deal with the responsibilities and media attention which accompanies his inheritance. Ryder plays a tv producer after the inheritance story who happens to fall in love with the Sandler character, something which  pushes this flick from romantic-comedy into the realm of fantasy or sci-fi. In spite of its hard-to-swallow romantic side plot, the film offers nonstop in-your-face silliness and nonsense which should make it a fun watch for fans into Sandler's brand of deadpan kookie comedy. Non-Sandler fans can expect a lukewarm result. (C+)",/review/rw3382411/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2003,claudio_carvalho,7," An Enjoyable Family Entertainment
","Longfellow Deed (Adam Sandler) is an owner of a pizzeria in a tiny American city who inherits a fortune of forty billion dollars from a distant relative. He moves to New York and there he is chased by the press, searching for information about the newest millionaire in USA. A tabloid reporter (Winona Ryder) gets close to him to get inside information and guess what? Fall in love with him. Although being a predictable plot, this movie is a good family entertainment. Adam Sandler performs his usual role of a naive and good boy. Winona Rider is very beautiful in this movie. I am a fan of her, but I do not remember seeing her so gorgeous like in ""Mr. Deeds"". ""Mr. Deeds"" is an enjoyable movie that deserves to be watched and with a good and positive message in the end. My vote is seven.",/review/rw3382411/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2007,inkblot11,7," It is indeed a pleasure to watch Mr. Deeds, Sandler style; Turturro is magnificent
","Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler) lives in the small town of Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire, where he runs the local pizza parlor. His real ambition, however, is to write verse for Hallmark's greeting cards. Yet, so far, every rhyme he has sent them has been rejected. That does not matter to the townies, who love hearing Deeds recite his poems at the restaurant. One day, a billionaire (Howard Keel) dies on top of Mount Everest. He leaves no will, making it necessary for his huge company to seek out any heirs. You guessed it, Deeds is a long-lost nephew who inherits a boatload of dough. The company manager, Chuck (Peter Gallagher) wants to give Deeds 42 billion to sell his stock shares back to him. Deeds agrees at first. But, once he gets to his uncle's posh Manhattan mansion where servant Emilio (John Turturro) waits on him hand and foot, Deeds has second thoughts. Not only that, but he meets a beautiful local lady named Pam (Winona Ryder) and he is enchanted by her. But, beware, Deeds. Pam is really a reporter named Babe who is out to get dirt on him. And, are there indeed secrets to uncover? Who will end up with the money? This is really a sunny film for a rainy day. It is lighthearted fun with an absolutely terrific cast. Sandler is quite funny, of course, but John Turturro steals every one of his scenes with a performance that should have garnered him an Oscar. It's THAT good, yes. Ryder, Steve Buscemi, Gallagher, and many others are true delights as well. Then, too, the film looks amazing, from the costumes to the sets and beyond. It appears that no expense was spared and the result is a lovely-to-look-at film, too. Finally, the script is imaginative and humorous, making the viewer chuckle and grin nonstop. Do you, indeed, want a film to vanquish the blues after a rough day? You could, truly, find no better remedy than this one.",/review/rw3382411/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2006,lee_eisenberg,7," as it turns out, some millionaires have made the mistake that Preston Blake makes
","Since this remake of a classic movie is an Adam Sandler flick, you can pretty much predict most of it, namely the fact that he can get aggressive and that one character eventually reveals something embarrassing about himself. But otherwise, you're sure to have a good time. As an earthy goof-ball inheriting a massive fortune and turning the business world upside down, Sandler makes the most of his role. In supporting roles, Winona Ryder, John Turturro and Steve Buscemi have some great moments. Obviously, ""Mr. Deeds"" isn't any kind of ""Citizen Kane""-style masterpiece, but it doesn't pretend to be; and let's face it, this movie easily beats any Jean-Claude Van Damme movie for smarts. Nice, goofy fun. Also starring Allen Covert, Peter Gallagher and Jared Harris.",/review/rw3382411/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2003,rchrdshelt,10," Utterly Hilarious Movie!
","Whoever thinks this movie is rubbish is dead wrong. I laughed throughout the whole of this movie. I watched it on Cable and didn't really know much about it except that it had been in the cinemas recently. I had seen some other Sandler/Herlihy movies ages ago and thought they were hilarious, but I did not know this was one of their movies so I didn't know it what it was going to be like. Like their other movies this one delivers brilliantly with some particularly very, very funny scenes. I won't give any away but I can name plenty of them. I have not seen all of Tim and Adam's movies, but I definitely will soon. So far I have seen Happy Gilmore, Mr. Deeds, The Wedding Singer, The Waterboy and Big Daddy and found them all funny but my favourites are ranked:",/review/rw3382411/?ref_=tt_urv

","I thought Mr. Deeds was absolutely hilarious, when I was a kid. It was one of my favorite movies. Now that I'm older, and have a lot more experience with comedies, I have to admit that it's not quite as wonderful as I once thought it was. It's so-by- numbers and unimaginative, that I can't imagine much passion or effort was put into making it, at all. ",/review/rw3382411/?ref_=tt_urv

28 June 2002,mm-39,7," Well I like this film
","Spoiler This film is funny, but not a classic.  It had a message about values, done very lightly, which is an improvement over Hollywood's typical over powering social messages.  Its about values, and how one small town person views greed, and corporate culture.  This fish out of water movie is touching, in todays society which is a culture of greed and death.  It is awful to see how some people view profit and greed over peoples lives. Where money is viewed as the value of the person.  Mr Deeds does not change for his character would not allow that.  It appears where I work, no matter how much overtime many of my miserable co workers do, I see no magical change that some believe the extra money will bring.  Deeds does not let the wealth go to his head, like many rich and powerful people.  In the end he finds true love, and has fun acting silly.  I regret to say, my wife compares me Sadlers behavior in this film. 7/10",/review/rw3382411/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2015,Floated2,6," Typical past Adam Sandler film
","Mr. Deeds is very similar to many other Adam Sandler films. The film follows a basic and predictable formula. Many of the comedian's reliable standards are in effect: abuse of old folks, crude humor, a Rob Schneider appearance, and mentally deficient sidekicks. Some of the stuff works, but there's not much room for originality. This movie even perpetuates Sandler's trend of playing guys who are unexpectedly good at dishing out beatings.
