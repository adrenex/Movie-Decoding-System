18 July 2014,CalRhys,," Visually Stunning And Philosophically Daring
","One of the most visually stunning and philosophically daring war films ever made. In 1978, Terrence Malick made the hit classic 'Days of Heaven', for 20 years after its release, Malick didn't create a single film, that was until the release of 1998's World War II epic 'The Thin Red Line; my God was the wait worth it. 'The Thin Red Line' is a complex and moving depiction of war that happens to act as one of the most realistic portrayals of WWII ever displayed, both visually and psychologically. Literally Malick emerged from hiding to create this gem of a classic that portrays the chaos of war. Despite being the same release year as the much more successful 'Saving Private Ryan', Malick's war flick will go down in Hollywood history as a truly special masterpiece.",/review/rw0473830/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film is three hours of movie poetry. ""Saving Private Ryan,"" though brilliantly made, is a jingoistic cartoon by comparison. ""Thin Red Line"" follows a company of American rifleman brought in to consolidate the Allied grip on the Pacific island of Guadalcanal in 1942 in the face of Japanese invasion, but the place could be just about anywhere where war is fought.",/review/rw0473830/?ref_=tt_urv

","The greatest fault of The Thin Red Line was its timing - it was released at around the same time as Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.  While most people dismissed The Thin Red Line as the `other' World War II movie of 1998, it's actually a very different kind of film - the film itself is not hurt by similarity to Ryan but was hurt commercially due to the misconception. It's easy to forget that Red was nominated for seven Oscars.  This is an extraordinary film that can stand well on its own next to Ryan.",/review/rw0473830/?ref_=tt_urv

MIT had the decade before gone through a soul-searching re-evaluation of the type of scientist it was producing, and concluded that they could do much better in working toward well-rounded citizens. So by the end of the 60's they had collected - for a few years only - perhaps the strongest collection of newly emergent thinkers in the humanities. And it was quite a rich stew of ideas for a young person, the most exciting place in the world for the humanities for perhaps five years.",/review/rw0473830/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 1999,RogerKapur,," The most influential film of the 1990s
","The ""Thin Red Line"" is not an easy film to understand. It uses one of  the most complex narrative structures yet produced by cinema to tell  three stories (yes, it DOES have a plot): 1) the one the book wanted to  tell (the book's title comes from a 19th century allusion to the  British Empire's infantry  whose small numbers managed to  'protect' the British [""civilization"" from their point of view] from  the countless hordes of ""savages"" which the Empire ruled (this concept  is regrettably racist). James Jones used this analogy to tell the story  of how young American soldiers with no battlefield experience become  bloodied veterans. 2) the fundamental paradox of war: to protect  ""civilization"" (all that we hold dear) we are prepared to send young  men to fight in wars. We know that in war they will see and do things  that will turn them into the very ""savages"" that we are trying to  prevent from destroying our civilization. If you believe that there are  things even worse in the world than war (genocide, rule by the Axis  powers) then war is not irrational, but the paradox mentioned above  exists. 3) man is not distinct from nature but a part of it. Therefore,  nature is both beautiful and cruel. (Like our civilization and war).  To tell these stories Terence Malick used symbolic imagery, flashback,  voice-overs, passages without dialogue, long close-ups of the actors'  faces, changes in tempo and a haunting score.  For example, his use of symbolism has been much criticized but  everything has a purpose e.g. the crocodile entering the green algae  covered water (nature's savagery), the native man who passes the  company, after they land on the beach, walking in the opposite  direction apparently oblivious of their presence (their shocked and  bewildered faces reveal how they are forced to question the relevance  of the reasons for which they may shortly die - the defense of  civilization), the tree being choked by parasitic vines ('nature is  cruel' as Lt. Col. Tall so aptly puts it), the bird being born as a  soldier dies (it was not dying as many people thought - ""we come from  the earth and return to it"" as we hear in the voice-overs), dogs eating  a human corpse (""dog eat dog"" - the soldiers are becoming desensitized  to the violence) the same crocodile, now dead, at the end of the film  being carried away as a sort of trophy (danger has receded for the  moment), the coconut sprouting a palm on the empty beach in the last  scene (after death comes birth - the cycle of life). There are, of  course, many, many other examples.  The use of flashback accompanied by voice-over to convey feelings as  opposed to narrate a story must have appeared strange to anyone who  never saw Alain Resnais' ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"". It was used most  effectively with Ben Chaplin's character (Pvt. Jack Bell) when he  thinks of his wife back home - incidentally he idolizes her in the same  way we do our own culture - another metaphor. His disillusionment is  profound and shows that what he was prepared to die for was only as  pure as any ideal.  It is often say that there was no character development. This is also  false. For example, in the scene where Sgt. Welsh is speaking to Witt  shortly after his arrest for being AWOL , Welsh seems to claim that it  is every man for himself when he says that individual sacrifice is  worthless, there is no world but this one and that each man must get  through the war the best that he can. However, we subsequently see him  risking his life to deliver morphine to a MORTALLY wounded man during  the frontal assault on the Japanese machine gun nests. Also, Witt can  not understand where evil comes from in the midst of the beauty he sees  in the Melanesian village, but when he returns there he sees man  arguing, enemy skulls, crabs hideously crawling around on an  outstretched human hand and a child's back covered with insect bites  while those people around it are seemingly uncaring. These images  suggest that evil is inherent in man.  Malick avoids the usual stereotypes. Although we see heroic acts (such  as the taking of the machine gun nests by Capt. John Gaff's [John  Cusack] team of volunteers), there are no recognizable heros. It is  true that the characters are not sharply defined. When the violence  comes it is against all of them i.e. all of US.  Are there then any relevant negative criticisms of the movie? I would  say that it did not meander as some critics alleged (every scene has a  purpose) but it was unnecessarily long. There is a certain irony in  this. It is said that Malick edited over 100 hours of material first to  9 hours. Understandably the studio did not accept this. He then reduced  it to 6 hours and then to 3. (This helps to explain the lightning  appearances by John Travolta and George Clooney, I see no problem,  however, with using big name stars in such short roles - Richard  Attenborough did it in ""A Bridge Too Far""). With so much cherished  material available, I suspect that Malick fell into the trap of opting  for the maximum length that the studio would allow when more  artistically efficient editing would have reduced the film to 2* hours.  The balance between the action and meditative passages would have  worked better if certain scenes had been cut, such as Witt's passing a  wounded soldier on the way back to his company after leaving the  Melanesian village the second time and also the conversation that Witt  and Welsh have towards the end of the film (Welsh appears a stranger to  him, suggesting that he is simply a troublemaker). Even with the  exclusion of these scenes Witt would still appear a humanist and Welsh  a complex ""every man"".  Most people would agree that the film is visually stunning. As there  has been very little even remotely similar in the past, it will be  confusing for many people but I am convinced that this will come to be  seen as a hugely important work - the most influential of the 1990s.",/review/rw0473830/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I was about 7, I first saw Rocky on TV and I didn't really understand it. It wasn't until I was 18 that I came to the conclusion, that it was the greatest movie ever made. At 22, that all changed when I first saw On The Waterfront. Fully aware now that Brando was a god. The ultimate male. Never not shocking, bruiting desire. At 24 it was a toss up between Eyes Wide Shut and Casablanca. Cruise controls a certain air and Bogart was the coolest guy to ever live.

30 December 1998,Warman-2,10," A different, enthralling war film.
","The Thin Red Line has no real hero and no real plot to speak of. Due to its release the same year as Saving Private Ryan it will forever be linked to Spielberg's anti-war opus. Yet, ""TRL"" deserves to be compared to  Stanley Kubrick's 2001 due to it's style and distance from the audience. The film's only character is the Charlie Company and the conflict is between humankind itself. Director Terrance Malik asks profound questions and unlike ""Ryan,"" doesn't expect them to be answered because they simply can't be answered. Like 2001, the viewer is left with more questions than answers at the end of the film and is told in stunning visual fashion. Some critics have pointed out various flaws in the film; however, these traits are what sets TRL apart form it's peers. The stars like John Travolta and George Clooney have little screen time. They are the officers who command attention and are larger than life to the simple GI's who do the real work (and most of the acting in the film.) The characters are mostly unrecognizable and you know little about them save the main characters like Pvt. Bell. But, the faces are meant to be unrecognizable; to paraphrase the film they are simply flesh and meat made from the earth simply to return back to it. Those who criticise the lack of violence in some scenes while labeling the other scenes intense don't realize the intensity the fight scenes generalize are due to the fact that the soldiers don't know when their next battle will be and when their last breath will take place. The main character, Charlie Company, is fighting to stay alive, the only real driving force of the plot. All of the characters have different views of the war, shown through the use of random spoken narrative. There is no easy conclusion to the war and the film starts off where it began, among the animals of the pacific. Life is one huge circle and one could guess the battle for the bunker on top of the hill could be fought again and there is no possible way to stop it, (At least that is what I was able to muster of the film itself.) For myself the most haunting image was the scene when the Americans stare at their Japanese enemy after capturing the hill. Both sides seem to realize that they could be on the other side of the battle and that in war there really is no good vs. bad scenario, just what nation you're from and who you are trying to kill. Yet the question asked is why war occurs and why we must fight each other. On that note, we still have no answers. The acting and sound are superb. The direction, editing, and score are all Oscar caliber. I don't shrink from saying that TRL is the best film of 1998 and one of the greatest war films of all time; (and contrary to what some are trying to say it is a war film, that is at its core.) TRL is the only film to ever make my knees tremble and haunt me days after I saw it. If you see it, I'm sure your opinions will be just as strong as mine.",/review/rw0473830/?ref_=tt_urv

","Every group has its pantheon of saints whether they are sportsmen, artists, politicians, salesmen, folk singers, bankers, crooks or, of course, film makers.

So criticising the man and his work is not just like giggling at a funeral but dropping your trousers and taking a dump in full view of the corpse. It just isn't done, and anyone who indulges in that kind of behaviour - or dares to criticise St Terrence and one of his films - is quite obviously a candidate for the funny farm. Well, perhaps.
