7 January 2007,mjw2305,6," Harmless fun - unfortunately geared towards the kids
","Firstly, i really liked the CGI incarnation of everyone favourite cat and i thought Bill Murray provided his voice superbly, capturing his character with perfection. Other than that though Garfield - the movie failed to deliver the essence of the cartoon's produced by Jim Davis. The humour in the original comic strips were entirely geared at the adult generation, not the kids.",/review/rw6824815/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,4," Definitely not the worst movie ever, but it is fairly low on laughs!
","I didn't absolutely hate Garfield 1, but I personally thought the film wasn't that great. The first problem is that the plot is as thin as a piece of cardboard and rather slow-moving. Bill Murray does his best with rather superficial material, but at times he sounds rather monotonic. While the script isn't completely devoid of humour, it is very uneven, and while kids will like the jokes, adults won't find much to go on. Stephen Tobolowsky's villain, despite having some good delivery, just doesn't quite convince, likewise with Brekin Meyer as Jon.",/review/rw6824815/?ref_=tt_urv

23 June 2004,dire69,8," One Purrrr-Fect Movie
","I just saw this movie tonight with a friend and we both enjoyed it very much, well worth our time and money.  This movie is perfect for the whole family.  They should make more movies like this instead of those typical slasher/violent movies and also the ones with so much sexual content.  When this movie comes out for purchase, I will most probably buy it because I could watch it over and over again.  I'm really glad that they made this movie, I would've never thought that they would've done this movie but I am truly glad and happy that they did because I love cats and I love ""Garfield"".  He's my favorite comic strip and read him every single day and will continue to do so for as long as the strip runs in the newspaper.",/review/rw6824815/?ref_=tt_urv

13 June 2004,Jeff M.-3,7," Decline, and maybe even fall, of the Garfield empire
","After engaging in an effort to find a good review - much harder than I ever imagined it would be - and finding the movie listed at the bottom of the barrel, I felt almost an obligation to go see this on opening day - either to prove the critics wrong, or to get fodder for a scathing letter to Jim Davis.

25 October 2004,Coventry,4," No movie-material
","All the years I've been a loyal reader of the Garfield comics, I never had the impression it's merely meant for kids. On the contrary, most of the dry humor and charismatic Garfield poses are difficult to 'get' for young children. And yet, the film completely aims for a youthful audience. I have no problem with a movie being pro-children, but this is exaggerated and hardly accessible for adult viewers. The movie totally lacks all the elements that make the comics so entertaining. Garfield's clever and sarcastic remarks, Jon's clumsy womanizing techniquesÂ… All this has been replaced with an unhealthy dose of feel-good messages and lame jokes. The computer engineered Garfield doesn't appeal and the other, real pets are badly chosen. The plot is standard-sentiment, with Garfield saving his new housemate puppy from a sneaky, fame-chasing TV host. Breckin Meyer (as Jon Arbuckle) and Jennifer Love Hewitt (as the yummy vet Liz) walk around without anything to do and Bill Murray voices Garfield like it's some sort of dire job he wants to get rid of asap. The first (long-awaited?) cinema adventure of everybody's favorite cat appears to be a quickly produced and unprofessional flick soon to be forgotten. Too bad, since you're left behind with the feeling they could have done something better with this.",/review/rw6824815/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2015,SnoopyStyle,6," Bill Murray is the perfect Garfield in light comedy
","Garfield (Bill Murray) is the big-boned, lasagna loving, demanding cat belonging to Jon Arbuckle (Breckin Meyer). He hates to leave his cul-de-sac but Jon keeps bringing him to the vet Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt). Jon has a crush on her since high school. She asks him to adopt Odie. Garfield doesn't like to share Jon's affections. Odie catches the attention of local TV morning personality Happy Chapman (Stephen Tobolowsky). Garfield gets pushed out of the house. Odie goes to accompany him but he locks Odie out. Odie wanders off and gets dognapped by Chapman who wants the dog to be a performance on his show. Bill Murray is the perfect Garfield. He's sarcastic and lovable. That goes for both Murray and Garfield. The story is light kids comedy. It's not terribly deep. It has the essence of the comic strip. This is for Garfield fans.",/review/rw6824815/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2004,michaelRokeefe,2," The original fat cat?
","What happened to the cartoon Garfield we've grown to love? Live action mixed with CGI and a simple story line with an unimaginative script; I guess small children are not expected to notice such. Garfield's lasagna gorging and TV watching is slightly interrupted when his owner Jon(Breckin Meyer)falls head over heals for an attractive veterinarian(Jennifer Love Hewitt)that influences the adoption of a puppy named Odie. When Odie is abducted, Garfield is compelled to drag himself off the couch and search for the likable canine. Bill Murray provides the voice of Garfield and is to put it mildly...a p-ss poor fit for the clever actions of the lazy and lovable rotund feline. What happened to Jon the nerd? And he sure shouldn't be deserving the attention of someone as fine as JLH. This movie could have been much more if done in the vain of maybe SHREK or FINDING NEMO. But no doubt...the small fry will probably wear their copy out before entering elementary school.",/review/rw6824815/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2005,Boba_Fett1138,5," Entertaining enough to watch it once but the movie is extremely forgettable.
",As simple good clean entertainment this movie really isn't that bad. The movie however fails to making a lasting impression. Nothing in the movie is something new or memorable. The story itself is also extremely simple. The fact that the movie is so incredible short makes the story seem even worse than it perhaps is.,/review/rw6824815/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2017,leplatypus,4," An unusual kids movie for kids only (dad)
","In other words, as an adult, i got bored quickly! However i like cats (over dogs) and there isn't much cats movies nevertheless this one is really bad: as he kept talking, after five minutes, i was fed up! His attitude is also not enjoyable and at the end, he is not funny! The story is dragging, already seen (toy story 2), with transparent characters really inspired from classic Disney (Crueala!). sure i maybe laughed a few times but at the end, i was rather happy that it was a quick movie (not even 80 minutes)! Finally, i found that the real dog was much more interesting, that this movie ranks very low for interacting characters (Roger Rabbit stays the best!) and indeed Hewitt was the bait to make wait dads!",/review/rw6824815/?ref_=tt_urv

24 July 2004,jamiehill_uk,7," Quite a good kids movie.
","I don't see why people blast this movie so much. It is funny, well acted and well animated. Breckin Meyer plays the nerdy Jon very well and acts like the pet loving dork that we loved so much in the cartoon. Garfield looks amazing, almost identical to what he looked like in the cartoon. Bill Murray is perfect to play him and his voice is similar to Lorenzo Music. They included all the trates of Garfield- lasagne, TV and being a lazy fat cat. Thye kept Odie the moronic but lovable dog. They kept the fact that Garfield has an agreement with the mice and gets on with them. They kept Liz the vet, which brings so much more to Jon. This is a great kids movie, that i am sure adults who watched this as a kid will love too.",/review/rw6824815/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2004,Troy2Slick,7," Garfield is as fat as ever...
","I think that this movie accomplished what it set out to do. I don't know why so many people are hard against it. I think it's a very cute movie, beings that I grew up reading Garfield comic strips and watching Garfield and friends. I'm 26 and still am a kid at heart, what can I say, I love cutesy little movies such as this. It won't win any awards or anything, but I think it's great for the kiddies out there, or adults who still have a kid in them. I rate this move about a 6 out of 10. Not too shabby. If you're expecting a movie the calibur of Toy Story, Finding Nemo, them maybe this movie isn't for you. It's mainly for children or fans of Garfield. Rest in peace, Lorenzo Music, you will be missed and your voice matched perfectly for the loving fat orange cat we've all grown to love.",/review/rw6824815/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2004,claudio_carvalho,7," Funny and Delightful
","Jon Arbuckle (Breckin Meyer), the owner of Garfield, accepts the dog Odie as a gift from Garfield's veterinary Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt) to impress her. Jon has had a crush on her since high school, and intends to use Odie to have a chance to date Liz. Garfield becomes jealous, leaves Odie outside the house along the night and the dog is abducted by Happy Chapman (Stephen Tobolowsky), who wants to use the dog in a show in New York. Garfield decides to rescue Odie back to Jon. First of all, I am suspect to write about Garfield, my favorite cartoon together with Hagar. I bought this DVD a couple of weeks ago, but when I saw the IMDb User Rating and the titles of some reviews, I thought that I had wasted my money. Today it is raining in Rio de Janeiro, and I decided to watch the movie, expecting a horrible film. What a good surprise, I liked it a lot. The story is very simple, but shows all the components of the cartoon: Garfield, very lazy, selfish, loving lasagnas, jealous, and having the voice of Bill Murray to give a very special touch to this fat cat. Odie is very sweet, but Breckin Meyer is weak in the role of Jon, and the delicious Jennifer Love Hewitt has a minor participation. A good entertainment, indicated for the whole family and fans of Garfield. My vote is seven.",/review/rw6824815/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2006,luciano_cirne,5," Not so bad, but....
","As a huge fan of the laziest cat on Earth, I confess that I was really expecting too much of this movie, but when I watched it, I got a bit disappointed... ""Garfield"" is not a bad movie at all, but is far away than all the fans expected, for some reasons in particular:",/review/rw6824815/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2019,tabuno,7," Much Better Than Led To Believe
","13 November 2004. From the critics and the box office, I was led to believe that this movie would be terrible. But as liked Garfield as a cartoon and television series, I took a chance. Perhaps it was my low expectations, but I found the movie entertaining with a good, consistent plot unlike most of Garfield's one liners and short brief attention span snippets that we're all used to. Instead this movie had at its core a wonderful storyline that brings together some of the developing history of Garfield, especially Odie.",/review/rw6824815/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2019,lukem-52760,7," A CUTE FUN LITTLE FAMILY FANTASY & NICE ESCAPISM.
","I grew up loving Garfield from young & even though i was like 21 yrs old when Garfield the movie came out i was still excited to see that fun loving orange cat brought to life on the big screen & with the added bonus of the comic genius Bill Murray doing his voice!!!!
I genuinely liked the Garfield movie i know it was aimed more at young kids but the Garfield loving young boy in me did like it & thought it was good light hearted silly fun.
Garfield looked cool for it's time back then in 2004 & Murray was the perfect choice for his sarcastic voice & even Breckin Meyer was fine as owner Jon & odie was fine as an actual real dog, i get why they did that so the main focus & money was spent on creating Garfield so that was a good choice.",/review/rw6824815/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2014,Rectangular_businessman,1," Horrible, just like all the other live-action versions of cartoons
","Like I said before, I don't see the point in making live-action versions of cartoons...All those lame adaptations are ugly and unappealing, and always fail to capture the essence of the animated works in which are inspired. At best, those movies could only capture the most shallow and pragmatic aspects of the source material. This movie is the ultimate proof of that being one of the most shallow, dull and uninspired films ever made, lacking the sarcastic sense of humor which made Garfield popular in first place.

16 May 2019,mitsubishizero,6," It's not really bad
","I grew up watching this a kid and I liked it then but watching it now I realize how the flaws are more apparent. To say that it strays far from the source material is an understatement. Garfield voiced by Bill Murray basically does his usual shtick of annoying his owner Jon(Breckin Meyer), tormenting Odie and gorging on weeks worth of food particularly lasagna. A lot of people hate Garfields CGI design but given the time it was created I think it's done pretty well. What I do have an issue with is how Garfield's CGI yet the rest of the animals aren't.

","The long-running comic strip finally got a belated big screen adaptation in 2004, with digital animation bringing the cheerfully fat & lazy orange tabby to ""life"". Bill Murray voices Garfield, whose existence is thrown for a loop when his owner Jon (Breckin Meyer) adopts a second pet, a sweet (if not that bright) mutt named Odie. Although the canine is a major nuisance to Garfield at first, Garfield *does* become attached to him - to the point that Garfield embarks on an ambitious rescue when Odie is dog-napped by ""Happy Chapman"" (top character actor Stephen Tobolowsky), a local TV host and slimy worm desperate to break into the big time.",/review/rw6824815/?ref_=tt_urv
