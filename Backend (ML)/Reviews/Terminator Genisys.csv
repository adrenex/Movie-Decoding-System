26 December 2018,Gordon-11,," Romantic comedy for the family
","After watching the trailer, I thought this film was a light hearted romantic comedy. While watching it, I realised it was more of a family film with a lot of romantic comedy elements in it. It is fun, positive and squeaky clean. I enjoyed it.",/review/rw4238806/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2019,emmarosepollard,8," Thoroughly enjoyable
","I watched this film earlier today and really enjoyed it. It has everything - laughter, tears, an adorable dog and a lovely storyline. Highly recommend for children and adults alike.",/review/rw4238806/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2019,paindweller,10," One of the most enjoyable films I've seen in too long
",No words can describe this film it was so good I was in tears at the end. It gets off to a wobbly start then slowly picks up & you can't help but fall in love with the characters in the end. We need more gems like this.,/review/rw4238806/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2019,ingamazonaite,10," Underrated
","I think it's great family movie.
In this category of movies you don't really need drama or something special.
It's just movie about girls and dogs friendship.
It's cute movie.",/review/rw4238806/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2019,Franklie,10," Rare laugh-out-loud, pollution-free, high-quality entertainment. Please keep it coming.
",A BIG 10 out of 10 for daring to be and choosing to be practically squeaky clean!! A gigantic well-done to everyone involved in going pollution-free. SO great.,/review/rw4238806/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2019,mike48128,9," For Dog Lovers!
","A young English schoolteacher inherits a 9 year-old Pug Dog from her grandmother and has several life-changing adventures because of ""Patrick"". He reminds me of a compilation of the many dogs I have owned throughout my lifetime. Mischievous, messy, destructive, and ultimately totally lovable and unforgettable. Most enjoyable as everything turns out alright at the end. It's a romantic comedy and far better than anything on The Hallmark Channel. Is it totally realistic? of course not! It's a welcome change from the typical dog movie wherein something terrible happens to the dog in the end! Probably will be enjoyed mainly by little kids and adults. No talking dogs in this one! A British production distributed by ""Buena Vista Int'l"" (""Disney"" in the UK.)",/review/rw4238806/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2019,texasgal1976,7," Pleasantly Surprised
","I didn't know what to expect, but this movie kept my attention, had some interesting subplots, and was genuinely sweet and funny. The lead was likable and the pug was adorable. I enjoyed Sarah's interactions with her family, her work life, and there was even some romance. If you enjoy romantic comedies or even family films featuring animals, this may be the film for you.",/review/rw4238806/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2019,Iluvcleanfunnymovies,8," Some reviews are harsh, this is a very cute film
","Keep in mind, I say this while giving all credit to Patrick, the dog, HE is the most natural actor in the whole film: it's a cute film! There are scenes that are predictable, i.e. the young woman whose life is a mess, and gets messier...
The scenes with Patrick are absolutely priceless! It's worth it to get through the movie just to see those scenes with Patrick. Patrick has a big ego, but he's very lovable and loyal.
The reviews that are critical, they are critics and I get it, but it's rare to find a film that you can recommend it to friends and family, it's a clean film that will at least leave you smiling at the end. As many funny parts, there's just as many cheesy parts that make you want to roll your eyes, but I've seen it twice now and I'll probably see it a few more times.",/review/rw4238806/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2019,elenaphysics,8," Funny and feel-good movie
","This is a movie worth-watching.
Of course do not expect to watch a masterpiece. It is simple, it is funny and enjoyable. It is what it was meant to be.
The main protagonist Sarah is a nice person, easy-going. The movie is funny and doesn't try hard to become something it is not meant to be.
It is a comedy with some romantic elements.
We don't experience all these boring motivational speeches and enormous life changes. We watch Sarah (who is in fact filthy rich), conducting a simple life and being a simple, caring person. Her life changes when she reluctantly adopts a dog and she starts to be more active and more social.
The plot is not complicated,it is simple and nice. After watching hideous films that were supposed to be comedies,this was a pleasant surprise.
I recommend it",/review/rw4238806/?ref_=tt_urv

5 August 2018,redrangerg,8," Low expectations but overall good film
",Me and my girlfriend love pugs so we thought why not. Actually a decent movie. Of course its a family film so needs to attract a younger audience but its a really feel good film i could put on during a gloomy afternoon. And its got a pug like come on people!,/review/rw4238806/?ref_=tt_urv

6 April 2019,deloudelouvain,6," If you like dogs it's okay.
","If you're expectations are just not that high, if you just want some easy entertainment, some laughs (predictable ones but overall not that bad) Patrick might be a movie for you. The entire movie is a feelgood family movie, not much of a story going on except the easy cheesy moments you usually have with these kind of movies. I did enjoy it, mostly because it's about a dog and that happens to be my weak spot, so I can't really complain. But to be realistic it's a movie fine to watch once on a rainy sunday with the whole family but that's about it. The acting is passable, nothing great but nothing cringing either. Could it have been better? Certainly but for dog lovers it will do the job.",/review/rw4238806/?ref_=tt_urv

26 July 2020,david-161-28390,9," Cute, engaging, famly-watchable rom-com
","I¬¥m not a dog-lover but I loved this film. Story was nothing special - but it acted as a vehicle for decent acting and plenty of laughs. No swearing, no sex-scenes, nobody shot to death - just a film with a few positive messages and plenty of laughs.",/review/rw4238806/?ref_=tt_urv

24 April 2019,dancingdebra,6," Sweet but a bit muddled
","Fun lightweight film with some emotional bits but enough dog scenes for children to enjoy. The lead character is likeable, interesting and strong. Really nice to see a scene where a lady tells a handsome, yet arrogant leading man what she really thinks of him in a classy way. And a good range of supporting characters who added just enough to compliment the main story.",/review/rw4238806/?ref_=tt_urv

15 July 2018,alistairc_2000,4," A good fun romp
",This is a delightful move and very British. It has a good cast and the lead actress is so pretty. I had to suspend disbelief as no one esp not even the drip who drops her at the start would ever leave this woman. She is a stone cold babe. So she is cast adrift with no friends and gets the gorgeous headstrong Patrick. Like all dogs he is a pain at the start but worms his way into her heart.,/review/rw4238806/?ref_=tt_urv
