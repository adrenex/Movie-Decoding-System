15 September 2013,michaeljhuman,10," Best car show and one of the best shows ever
","Some won't like this show. If you need drama to enjoy your TV, don't watch this. It's drama free. I have enjoyed shows like West Coast Customs, but they play off the drama more than the work on the cars.",/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2017,basscadet75,7," Great show for 13 seasons; ok one for the 14th
","I admit that I came late to this show, having only discovered it around the 12th season or so. I watched every episode I could voraciously once I did find it, though, going all the way back to the first season. Mike and Edd's no-nonsense way of buying and then fixing up cheap old cars as cheaply as possible was a refreshing change from the flashy American car ""restoration"" shows I was used to.",/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2019,PrinceBuster5,1," There are two 'Wheeler Dealers', there should be two pages.
","That is Brewer & Edd China then Brewer & no Edd China, and set in the US. One star refers to WD V2.0, ie the Discovery one, not the Attaboy Productions one.",/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2010,Immersion,8," Fantastic telly - with a relevant message for our times
","First of all, I must say that this program works mainly because of the personas in it:",/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2014,steve_mclaughlin2,," Love this show
","It's a real car restoration show without the unwanted side story lines. Minus Mike's Cockney accent during negotiations, Edd steals the show. My only negative comment would be how low they sell the cars. A beautifully restored BMW M3 for 6 thousand pounds? Not sure if there is a difference in the UK and the U.S. concerning used cars, but that was a steal. That car would have sold easily over $25k here. ",/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2013,deadsenator,8," Great show. Bubble gum for the shady-tree mechanic!
","I have watched nearly every season of this show and thoroughly enjoy it. I tire of Mike quickly, but I know he plays a necessary role and Edd is following up with some fine wrenching of his own. He really shines when explaining the detail of his work. I wish Edd's portion of the show might be extended for another 20 minutes to further explain his technique and ideas. As a shady-tree mechanic, this is the part of the show I find fascinating. ",/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2018,Superdupahorn,5," Americans have taken a winning and unique show and made it 'generic'
","In the early series of wheeler dealers Mike would go and buy a rough round the edges classic or other car. Give Edd a strict budget and then would usually make a profit. Edd would show us what he does, like how to tackle jobs like ime welding, electrics, even sometimes a bit of panel beating.",/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2018,proac_fan,8," Bring back Edd China PLEASE
",Like everything US TV execs get their mitts on they've managed to neuter a great show into an okay show. I think this show was the creation of Mike Brewer but as most people seem to agree Edd was the reason to watch. I applaud his decision to stand up to Disney and leave when the real car repair portion of the show was being relegated to being an afterthought. ,/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2014,MovieCriticDave,10," Great, no-nonsense show with a simple ""you can do it"" attitude
","Rarely do shows about often dry topics like car repair resonate with so many people, but it's clear that the British-produced ""Wheeler Dealers"" hits precisely this mark. With its simple, average-guy approach to buying, repairing, and selling used cars, it conveys an equally simple encouragement to the non-mechanic that anyone with a wrench and a bit of ambition can tackle most repair jobs. ",/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2014,christhjian,10," The best automotive show out there
","Wheeler dealers is a British motoring show where an used car, that needs a bit of care and love, is bought and mended or sometimes more thoroughly restored and sold afterward, hopefully with a profit. Seems like there are tons of similar shows out there, right? Answer is yes, there certainly are but Wheeler Dealers have some simple touches that makes it stand out the rest.",/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2015,michelvega,10," Great fun to watch
","I'm not a typical car buff but I love cars for their beauty and engineering. I've seen most American car shows but have been seriously derisive of how heavy they are scripted. Specious arguments, people getting mad, dropping off the job, bitching about anything. What a bunch of buggers. Wheeler Dealers has none of that nonsense. Looking at Edd, I'm amazed by his good nature and talent. I can almost see myself getting my hands greasy restoring an old clinker of a once great sports car. I know it won't ever happen, but all the same, the wizard makes every repair fascinating to watch. Mike is cheerful and his dealings let us often forget that he has a whole crew of cameraman, sound assistant, and most likely a tow truck or two following him. As negotiations for the used car goes on, it's funny enough to think of the crowd around them.",/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2020,petertmartin1987,3," Has potential but host let's it down
",Nothing worse when a show has a great concept but has the wrong host. Mike is an obnoxious in your face and annoying person to everyone be deals with. I feel sorry for Ed who's level headed and clearly knows what he's doing.,/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2017,sheppard-84489,3," Without EDD show is not unique and informative
","All the car shows now use to much cursing and are all about theatrics. I watch the show to learn something. Wheeler Dealers was a unique show. It taught me things. NOW the show is like all the others. Why should I waste me time. I can google how to repair things. If you want a special show it needs to be DIFFERENT, NOW IT'S NOT. This is so sad.

6 January 2021,rickshoe-78223,6," Old format was much better!
",This show was soooooo much better before Mike got all Hollywood and made the show more about himself then the cars. Now that they've added Ant it's even more Hollywood. Return to the UK and bring back Edd.,/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2016,treborbob-53437,5," Mike Brewer needs to stop acting like jerk.
",This review would be a 10 except for the fact that Mike Brewer has let his ego grow bigger than his stomach. They had a great chemistry until Brewer decided to try and muscle in on Edd China's forte. Edd is head and shoulders above Brewer in the shop. And it is clear that Brewer is only busting in there because he is jealous of Edd's popularity.,/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2019,chrischapman-47545,3," It just gets worse....
",I'm sorry but this show is past its best - becoming repetitious and even within the same show the same basic comments/observations get repeated over and over again - the producers must think the viewers are so thick that they didn't hear/understand it the first time? Why have such a huge production team - what on earth do they all do and does it get in the way of producing a realistic show? Ant is trying to fill the shoes left by Edd but Mike is still frankly a cocky pain in the neck - he's been in the business a long time and knows a lot but still comes across as rather bombastic and not the sharpest knife in the box. When mistakes are made they are covered over in a not very convincing manner. It's better that the manhours spent are now recorded but to restore a car there is a lot of preparation/detailing which isn't shown and parts are not available immediately so the timelines are also misleading. I am not convinced that Mike is the great bargainer/dealer he thinks he is. There is friction between him and Ant which echoes that with the ever patient Edd and it spoils the show - Mike's occasional bullying/contempt of his copresenters possibly hides some his felt own inadequacies?,/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2018,jason_a_ellis,1," Just not interested without Ed.
","Was a great show. It had that same quality Mythbusters had, it was entertaining, educational and I didn't have to worry of my 10yo daughter walked in the room because it was all kid safe if not kid interesting. 
The real star of the show was Ed and in the last couple of seasons it seemed to really fly with more time in the workshop than the tedious stuff about Mike looking for car on the internet. 
You could overlook the ridiculous ""profit"" that didn't include what would often have been thousands of pounds flying out to a city where a car was, renting a car to visit the car, towing it to a shipping agent and containering it back to the UK (or just putting it on a low loader when they moved to the US). You could ignore the Â£60-100 per hour in mechanics fees or Ed's tool collection that would cost many thousands of pounds to accumulate. You could ignore Mike selling cars for 1/2 what they're worth just to move them on. You could even ignore the obviously special deals Mike got from specialist repair people and manufacturers. You could do this because Ed's workshop bit was very good. Coming to the show recently and streaming the shows, I often skipped through the boring bits of the early shows where Mike bought a car and spoke to owners of a tidy example in the very early seasons watched Ed's section than skipped to the next episode when it got to Mike's sales bit. 
Mike was best when used as the parentheses around the Ed China Mechanical show, the cheeky chappy that told you what car they were going to get and why, sometimes offering insight on how not to buy a bad car, occasionally buying a few bits and then had a bit of fun at the end with the finished car.
The thing is, you watch the shows and you get to think of Mike as the funny bloke down the pub and Ed as your mate that helps you fix your motor. 
So Ed leaving the show because the production company Velocity, thought they should cut the mechanical side of the production as it was too expensive to make has really broken the show. It's like Happy Days losing The Fonz. ",/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2018,1bilbo,1," The show has died.
","Without Ed China this show has sunk to the typical ""Like wow man"" infantile level that most American car/bike shows have. ",/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2014,jlcrelly,10," I am not petrol head, but love this show.
","I am not a petrol head, but I love watching this show. It is great to see old classics and not so classic cars being given a second lease of life. Mike and Ed work very well together, and un-like other car shows, especially those from the USA, they do not engage in exaggerated emotions and tantrums. The most emotion you will see is Ed getting a pat on the back from Mike. In most instances, the vesicles are restored to factory condition, with an occasional upgrade of suspension and brakes etc, with very few cars being turned into hot rods or pimped rides. If you have watched the show since the beginning, it is interesting to see how Ed and Mike have become more confident in front of the camera. The budget has also increased significantly, as has Mikes waist line.",/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2017,fedorath,6," Take a Great Show and Mess it Up
","I will still watch Wheeler Dealers, that is if I can handle the ""High Energy"" music and sound effects which detract, not thrill or improve the show in any way. Ant seems a nice chap but the truncated mechanical aspects which added so much to the show are gone; what a terrible shame.",/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2021,philippe-art,5," we want Edd China !
",I loved the show when Edd China was part of it. His skills and presentation of the mechanical part of the show was unique and i considered Mike Brewer as his sidekick.,/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2018,snt043005,7," Give Ant a Chance
","I was really disappointed to hear that Edd had left the show. But I've been hooked on the show for years, and decided to watch the past 2 seasons with Ant as the new mechanic. 
To be honest, I think Ant has a strong personality of his own, and brings his own talents and spin to the show. It's still a great show and worth watching.
I do miss Edd, and I enjoyed him for years on this show. I was going to pout and boycott the show when he left. But I'm glad I stuck with the show and gave Ant a chance.",/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2020,twanster-1,1," Without China there's no show.
","Might just sound like an old fan disgruntled but I've genuinely tried to like the show since edd left. Unfortunately I saw this coming, they drifted more and more stateside and as such had to dumb down the show for ratings. Left time on the cars and more time with a used car salemen.. Mike doesn't even acknowledge his UK fan base with their upset about how he and the show ditched the UK. Meanwhile edds projects grow in numbers as does his fan base since while in the UK wheeler dealers is just another tacky us imported show.. Much like pimp my ride was, only he's selling the cars instead.. Watch and enjoy the show as we all did before but once edd left, the show lost its magic. Please USA, keep Mike over there.. ð¤£",/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2020,OsamaBenFartin,4," Gotten worse
","The repairs used to be lengthier, and more interesting. Not enough camera time now for the mechanical work done on the cars. Wasted time with recaps of what just got worked on after the commercial break, And more wasted time with the lads racing around with the finished car.",/review/rw6283445/?ref_=tt_urv
