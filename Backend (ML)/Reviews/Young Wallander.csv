21 June 2019,pokemon_trainer_lucas,10," Lovable characters and exciting plots
","I love the Ninjago series, because it has so many different factors that work in its favour: the characters are unique and relatable, the plots are exciting and engaging, the script can be funny at times, and the graphics are pretty good.
My favourite thing about the series is how it immerses you in the world of Lego Ninjago, and you feel yourself drawn into it so that you want to watch more and see how it develops.
I recommend it for kids and adults alike!",/review/rw6790759/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2019,zimmleanna,10," This show has depth
",My kids started watching this and I found myself getting sucked in. The characters and plot have a depth to them that even an adult can enjoy. Great show!,/review/rw6790759/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2018,scottkama,9," THIS SHOW IS AMAZING!!!!!!
","This is one of my favourite TV shows. it is a great family friendly show for all ages. and don't believe the people who say it sucks, because it is amazing. so I give it a nine star rating because it is funny, action packed, full of adventure, and just because it is a great show. this is one of my favourite LEGO TV show/movie. but I'm just going to warn you, if you start watching this show, you might not be able to stop!
so I would recommend watching it!",/review/rw6790759/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2012,sri-25,9," Actually impressed
","So far, we've been surprised by how well done this series is. Being a toy-selling series, we honestly were expecting the kind of shows we saw advertising toys when we were young: pointless, poorly written, and cheesy beyond belief. As adults, we actually ENJOY watching this series, and seeing what happens! Since it is geared to children (I would say about ages 8- 12), some of the plot ""twists"" are actually fairly obvious for an adult, but still interesting. ",/review/rw6790759/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2019,youssefabbas-23321,10," This is my favorite show ever!!
","This show is the best! So far 10 seasons have been complete and season 11 is airing right now! Season 9 is my favorite so far, my favorite episode of the series is Season 10 Episode 3, ""The Fall"" Anyway be warned, this show will hook you and you may not be able to stop watching it!! Season 11 airs on cartoon network every Saturday and I'm excited for episode 3 and 4 on June 29!!",/review/rw6790759/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2015,MasterOfLight,8," Yes...a LEGO show is actually great.
","Yes, I know. It's a LEGO show. About ninjas. It's a toy commercial. The storyline blatantly takes ideas from every story you've ever heard before. It's for kids, and though I'm a kid at heart, I'm not anywhere near Ninjago's target age range. And yet, Ninjago is one of my favorite TV shows. I first discovered it while babysitting a group of young children. But after a couple of episodes, the kids I was taking care of wanted to watch another show, and well...I wanted to watch more of Ninjago. After that, I was hooked. And not only me. I've introduced it to other friends and family members, from young kids to people in their twenties. And funny thing is...we've all enjoyed watching this show as a bit of a guilty pleasure. Because Ninjago, despite being so full of clichés and one giant LEGO commercial, is ridiculously fun.",/review/rw6790759/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2019,filleandersson-12821,8," WATCH IT NOW!
","I remeber watching this when i was a kid and i started watching this again because i wanted nostalgia. Currently on season 1 btw. But i really recomend you to watch it. Yes, it's for kids but it's really well written compared to other kid movies/series. Season one is a bit boring but to understand everything you bred to watch it. So go and watch it!",/review/rw6790759/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2018,ElektroBlitz,10," A very good TV-Show
",This show is really good and i want it to have a 7/10 on imdb! It is very exciting to watch even if you´re a teen or an adult. Season 8 was amazing and Season 9 will be nice too! Cant wait to the the other 9 episodes of season 9!,/review/rw6790759/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2013,mordecaiandtherigbys101,10," This show is excellent!
","This is is truly amazing. The characters are great, the writing is great, the music is great. Everything about this show is awesome! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes Lego. The show is set in the fictional world of Ninjago, a place inspired by Chinese and Japanese myths and culture. It appears in the series as a large sprawling land most like the island chain of Japan, with different areas being home to various animals and plants, including Dragons and mystical snakes (like the Great Devourer). It has an underworld, where beings of evil like Lord Garmadon and the Skeleton Army dwell, together with sacred places where many things are hidden or forgotten (like the Serpentine tombs or the Golden Weapons). Similar to Lego's past product line Bionicle, the main characters are in tune with certain elemental properties (the elements in this case being Fire, Ice, Lightning and Earth.) Also, the world seems to have a more modern setting than previous 'Ninja' series, as shown by the appearance of large skyscraper cities, various vehicles, video games and exo-suits. Again I love this show and can't wait for the next season to premier in early 2014!",/review/rw6790759/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2015,joegoldenproductions,9," Great show! Do NOT listen to critics!
","This show is awesome! I know, people always say: ""but it's LEGO, it can't be good, it's just a big commercial"" well, let me tell you something, they're wrong! It is actually an amazing show! It also appeals to many teenagers and adults as well, not just little kids! Now lets get down to the review, acting first.",/review/rw6790759/?ref_=tt_urv

14 October 2015,controllerjutzu,8," More to it than a toy commercial.
","Almost all of the ""professional"" critics gave this an unfair score because they didn't see it as anything past a toy commercial. That is wrong, you must see it as a show, and nothing else, in order to rate it. And of course Lego's main reason of making the series is to promote the sets so that they can get attention. But if that was so (it is only a toy commercial), then why is there such attention to detail that one might argue that there is too much detail?",/review/rw6790759/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2013,natebridgeman,7," A toy Company made this?
","Don't listen to critics. Whenever a kids TV show or movie comes along, they assume it is terrible just because it is for kids and do not watch it. Now if Lego does it, imagine. I thought it would be dorky and childish, but it had great characters, awesome villains, pretty cool fight scenes, heart and a couple of laughs. The only unoriginal season was the third one, which was purely for comedy. If anyone says it is a copy of bey blade or TMNT, remind them to not judge a book by its cover. The voice acting is great, and even Lord Garmadon, the villain, winds up being good in the end and cares for his son, showing no human is totally evil (unless possessed). Overall, it is great, and though may have some one-liners, it is a kids show, what can you expect? Also some elements are kinda dark, like the overlord, lord Garmandon and the 4 weapons and the serpentine.",/review/rw6790759/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2020,JoshiePoo69420,," Aged like fine wine
","As a kid, I used to watch this show a lot. I stopped after it was originally supposed to end but I gave it a second chance recently for nostalgia sake and rewatched the pilot and first 2 seasons. Everything after that was completely foreign to me. I thought the first few seasons were great, but the seasons after that were phenomenal. I originally thought that the show would lose its touch, but in my opinion the seasons got even more complex and entertaining. I really enjoyed how dark it got in the later seasons and how you could forget that it's a show about Lego people due to the amazing character development. Overall I love this show because of its humor (even though at times it could be better) and that it's self aware and doesn't always take itself too seriously. I would recommend that anyone, kids or adults give this show a chance! It's way better than it sounds!",/review/rw6790759/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2017,abbeyloveshkgaming,10," SO awesome!
","I've been watching this show ever since it came out in 2011, and I've been completely addicted to it ever since! All the characters have strong backstories, like my favorite character, Garmadon. Whether you like Legos or not this show is so awesome! They get more and more awesome as the season carry on. I'd DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone.",/review/rw6790759/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2019,gusdickens,10," Great show!

28 January 2020,justinns-28568,," The best
","It's simply a show that both girls and guys will remember all their lives and can connect deeply with it, I know it's childish and unrealistic when you watch it but that's how a kid thinks, I still like it and I'm a grown man... no I'm 17 but I will admit I love the show, my friends liked it to, I recommend your kids watch it! A great show that will keep them coming back",/review/rw6790759/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2016,chakor-74657,8," Great Series
","Ninjago: Masters of Spinjtzu is the first LEGO animated series to actually evolve into a full television program with different seasons and episodes. Although everyone says that the series is based on the LEGO Ninjago sets that coincide with each season, it is actually the other way around these days: the sets are actually based on the stories written by the Hageman Brothers. Since there are many different seasons, here are my thoughts on each below: ",/review/rw6790759/?ref_=tt_urv

13 April 2014,leprechaunpenguin,10," Awesome
","This show rocks!!! Its engaging and loads of fun. It also keeps you guessing all the time. I just love it! People seem to not like this show just because LEGO made it. Thats like saying just because Disney made Gravity Falls it means it sucks. But no Gravity Falls rocks! And so does this show.Season 1 focuses on the Ninja trying to determine which one of them will be destined to become the Green Ninja, a warrior who is destined to face the Dark Lord for the fate of Ninjago. It also focuses on Garmadon's young son Lloyd Garmadon, who has released an ancient evil: an army of five snake tribes known in legends as the Serpentine. The four Ninja must stop them from uniting to unleash The Great Devourer, a massive black, green and purple snake with the power to consume all of Ninjago and a bite that can turn people evil, which is what made Lord Garmadon into what he is now. However, Lloyd was betrayed by three of the five tribes before Sensei Wu convinces him to join their side, taking pity on him because of having being left alone. Eventually, the Serpentine held Lloyd as a hostage, and Lord Garmadon, who returned with the help of Sensei Wu, had agreed to aid the Ninja in rescuing Lloyd and stopping the Serpentine, considering the fact that Garmadon himself wants to be the one to threaten Ninjago and wanting revenge on the beast responsible for his fall into evil. To this end, he even gets the Skeleton Army to help fight against the Serpentine, despite the fact he planned their former leader's death. However, despite the combined efforts of the Ninja, Garmadon, and the Skeletons, the Snake King Pythor, the last of the much-feared tribe known as the Anacondrai, manages to release the Great Devourer in a mad attempt to gain his revenge on the people of Ninjago, although he realized too late that The Great Devourer consumes even its own kind. He and Wu are eaten by the Devourer, leaving only the Ninja, Nya (who became a secret fighter known as Samurai X) and Lloyd (revealed to be the Green Ninja) to fight against the monster. Eventually, Lord Garmadon comes to the rescue and destroys the creature by using the combined might of the Four Golden Weapons given by the Ninja. After the Serpent's destruction, Wu is found to have survived and Garmadon vanishes with the weapons. Despite losing the weapons, the Ninja prepare to train Lloyd so that he can face his father one day for the sake of Ninjago, something which he was afraid to for the sake of their bond.",/review/rw6790759/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2014,raylawrenceaguilar,10," Pretty Good
","I'm impressed, the only reason why it's at a 6.2 is because critics don't give trash about it being a kids show. It's LEGO for heavens sake. Kids around 5-10 play with LEGO. The show is MADE for kids for the most part. This shouldn't be criticized as ""Oh the story wasn't well made."" Even I agree with that, but it's a kids show. A lot of kids don't care about all these required (Good story, outline,plot, and reason etc.). they want an entertaining show to watch and laugh with. Most of these kids shows are action comedy, or princess love(for girls). Plus, reviewing this for a kids show is a 10/10 because it has a pretty well made plot.",/review/rw6790759/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2021,Peaceful224,8," Kind of under rated
","I remember when my little brother would watch this show around me and I would actually get really interested. I would sit down and watch it with him. The storytelling was actually entertaining and the animation was good. I haven't seen it in years so I'm not sure if I'd still like it. Lloyd's character development was really impressive. I saw most of the series but never got to finish all of it. Maybe one day I can. It was popular when it was newer but I never hear anyone talk about it anymore. Back then I never thought about how it's connected to actual lego toys, but my brother loved legos and would love to get the ninjago sets when he had the chance. There's many star wars toys but I'm not hearing anyone complain about that.",/review/rw6790759/?ref_=tt_urv
