22 April 2003,lambiepie-2,8," Ya gotta have a sense of humor!
","When this film came out with all of the PR and things, I hated it. I hated it without even seeing it. Then, as with many movies, I caught this on Digital Cable TV, by accident. I had NO intention of seeing it, but once I did, I cannot tell you how much I loved it.",/review/rw0524841/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 1999,Coxer99,9," There's Something About Mary
","Insanely off the wall comedy from the Farrelly Brothers that delivers from start to finish. Wonderful early sequence with Keith David as Diaz's father busting heavily braced Stiller's chops. Stiller's zipper scene goes down as one of the funniest and most painful things I have ever witnessed on film. Diaz is divine the woman of Stiller's dreams...Dillon is hired to find Diaz...He falls in love with her and gives Stiller a bum story... Lee Evans, a pizza boy, is in love with her too... then Brett Favre comes into the picture.  Every scene has something memorable from Dillon's attempts at reviving a dog to Stiller's ""pre date entertainment."" A classic that doesn't take itself too seriously.",/review/rw0524841/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2011,Boba_Fett1138,8," A real trend-setter.
","Whenver we refer to modern comedies I think we have to go all the way back to ""There's Something About Mary"" to see where this all started. It set the new standards for comedy and also became a much imitated movie. Movies however very rarely reached the level of this movie ever again, including all of the Farrelly brothers own later work.",/review/rw0524841/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2003,slokes,10," Funniest film since ""Blazing Saddles,"" only sweeter
","Did you ever see those annoying pop-up online ads about looking up old high-school friends? Did you ever stop to think that this movie is probably responsible? Really, there could be no other impetus for people to want to revisit the horrors of young adulthood then this sterling advertisement for reaching back and reclaiming the best of your past.",/review/rw0524841/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2003,Theo Robertson,9," One Of The Funniest Films Ever Made
","I don`t like comedies but I do enjoy much of the Farrelly Brothers stuff and THERE`S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY is their greatest achievment which is probably down to their casting . Ben Stiller is perfect as Ted while Matt Dillon is absolutely outstanding as sleazy ( And boy do I mean sleazy ) private investigator Pat Healy . My only criticism is of Cameron Diaz who`s slightly bland , but she is attractive and that`s all that matters",/review/rw0524841/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2000,rachdeveraux,," Unconventional satire stays on course while delivering major laughs
","A lot of my friends said they hated this, but after i saw it and loved what I saw, it became apparent that many of these people hadn't seen it, they just KNEW they would hate it from the degradingly mysoginistic slapstick it supposedly represented.  Sorry, wrong movie.  This is a classic satire, replete with balladeer narrator.  The gags flow fast and funny and expertly walk the tightrope between politically incorrect and unkind.  This is surprisingly a movie that is very true to itself and its characters with a lot of plotlines that tie up nicely in unusual ways.  And, it's a feel-good movie too.  Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller are marvelous together in the leads.",/review/rw0524841/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2018,AlsExGal,8," This movie could easily make you dislke men!...
","... because just about every man in the film is a liar. In 1985 Ted (Ben Stiller) is a geeky teenager who has a crush on beautiful Mary (Cameron Diaz). He asks her out to the prom, and she accepts. But before they can even go on their date disaster strikes in every possible, unintentional, and humiliating way for Ted, and the date never happens.",/review/rw0524841/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2010,secondtake,6," One of those comedies where you groan or cringe as much as you laugh. But such laughs!!

12 October 2018,bazookamouth-221-898097,8," Funny but crude.
","This is gross out comedy classic; Its aged relatively well as 20 years have passed now. Sometimes hilarious, sometimes crude and disgusting, maybe the very best movie from the Farrelly Brothers. Outstanding Matt Dillon in one of his best roles. The hair gel scene is infamous now as is the bathroom scene. Very funny and Cameron Diaz was so gorgeous in this. Classic stuff",/review/rw0524841/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2005,jaysilentbob37,7," One of the funniest movies of the 90's.
","I desperately wish that the Farelly brothers would go back to doing gross-out comedies like they did with Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, Me, Myself, and Irene, and this. This is by far the best of all their movies. There are three kinds of comedy. Comedies that make you smile (Sixteen Candles), comedies that make you laugh (Airplane), and comedies that cause you to nearly asphyxiate yourself from laughing so hard. This is one of those rare third category movies. With the friends I watched it with, the laughs sounded like nuclear bombs going off in my room. It's that funny.",/review/rw0524841/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 1999,Number8,9," There's something about Mary, and I agree.
","The plot is nothing new: A guy trying to get the love of the one he admired. We all have seen something like this in the past, and we will see something like this in the future. But in this movie the plot isn't important.",/review/rw0524841/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 1999,Meredith-7,7," Goofy, low brow humour- but it has something...
","In the past I have not been a great fan of the Farrelly brothers films, however this film is an exception. The dog scenes were probably the funniest personally, but there were heaps of other scenes that are well worth a mention. Cameron Diaz was fantastic as Mary, the girl everyone is after and Ben Stiller was excellent. Matt Dillon was way too over the top- I know his role somewhat warranted it- but did he have to be so excessive? He seemed so irritating. There is no doubt that the humour in this film is of the lowest possible calibre, but it really works- think Dumb & Dumber, but only quite good. Despite all the comic situations in the film, there is still something undeniably sweet in the centre of the story, I think thats what made it work. Its certainly not top class entertainment, but its highly recommended for when you are in a stupid mood and need a good laugh.",/review/rw0524841/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2006,DaRick89,8," There's Something About Mary and there's also something about this movie that makes me like it more than most other gross-out comedies
","There's Something About Mary is an apt title, for there is something about this movie that is quite endearing, particularly if you are a gross-out fan. Even if you are not a real fan of gross-outs, as is the case with me, you can still enjoy this film. This is because I find it to be funnier and more enjoyable than most other gross-out comedies (and that includes Team America). As a romantic comedy, it is also enjoyable and that is saying something as romantic comedy is, to me, a bastardised version of real comedy, often with a weak romance and diluted laughs. This is certainly not the case here. Having said that, it is not perfect: The Farrelly Brothers use a retard for cheap laughs once too often, which I did not like, the disabled guy wasn't that funny and the plot is a bit clich√©d and predictable, but I expected that.

10 December 1998,Chris J.,7," Funny, but surprisingly sweet too.
","The shock comedy aside (zipper and hair gel scenes), purposeful unpolitically correct moments (humor at expense of handicapped, animal cruelty), the most surprising thing about this film is it has heart and is rather sweet.   It's not the completely nasty, cruel comedy you might have been expecting.  There's a nice love story in here too.  It's corny and cliche'd and doesn't feel overly cloying because there are enough shockingly funny moments to offset it.  The acting is good, the pacing brisk, and the jokes, well... you've heard all about the best ones by now.",/review/rw0524841/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2003,EThompsonUMD,9," great screwball romantic comedy
","Not having seen ""There's Something About Mary"" since its theatrical release, I sat down to watch the DVD version fearing that, as often happens in the second viewing of romantic/screwball comedies, it would not be as funny as I remembered and that I would be sadly disappointed. Happily, it was, and I wasn't. Although it lacks the satirical bite and philosophical reach of ""Harold and Maude,"" the cult '70s romantic comedy to which ""There's Something About Mary"" traces its roots and pays repeated homage, this Farrelly brothers effort shares the earlier film's genre-bending spirit, shockingly iconoclastic images, and sharply written dialog - not to mention its sidesplitting hilarity.",/review/rw0524841/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 1998,ToddTee,8," A breath of (politically incorrect) fresh air!
",Ignores the overboard political correctness that plagues our life today and makes everyone a victim in favor of just plain funny stuff.  A real gut-buster!!!,/review/rw0524841/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2002,tfrizzell,," The Farrelly Brothers' Do It Again.
","In the tradition of ""Dumb & Dumber"" comes the equally hilarious and demented ""There's Something About Mary"". Ben Stiller stars as a loser who wonders what might have been after he was unable to go to the prom with his true love Mary (Cameron Diaz). The reason he cannot go is an important part of the movie in itself. Fast-forward a few years and Stiller continues to think of Diaz. Of course he enlists the help of slimy private investigator Matt Dillon to find her, but a problem occurs: Dillon falls in love with Diaz. This creates a problem for Lee Evans who plays a scholar in front of Diaz but is really a simple pizza delivery man. What follows are crazy situations and oh yes, don't forget Stiller's friend Chris Elliott who has a secret of his own. The film is just amazing in its ability to make the audience laugh. Every gag works to perfection and the whole film is a test to get through because you are laughing so hard that you might miss the next gag which is coming up. The jokes come in a constant wave and the whole film is just so comical that few can question the achievement of the film-makers. 4 stars out of 5.",/review/rw0524841/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 1999,JeffG.,1," Makes ""Porky's"" look like ""The Ice Storm"" by comparison.
","I went to see this movie after hearing about how funny it was. Guess they must have seen a different movie than I did. I didn't laugh even once during this film. Lots of bathroom humor, jokes about the mentally retarded, sex jokes, jokes about the mentally retarded, no likeable characters, bad acting...did I mention jokes about the mentally retarded? The fact that so many people actually considered this piece of trash funny and the sight off all the people in the theater around me laughing was disturbing to say the least. Is this really how far we as a society have degenerated?",/review/rw0524841/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 1998,ILuvJCS,9," A 10!!!!!
","How this movie could fail some cheesy ""Watch test"" is beyond me!  This was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, with hilarious bits, and the hot Cameron Diaz helped too.  It has some of the funniest things I've seen since a Kevin Brown movie, the zipper scene even better.  Anyone who can, should see this movie!",/review/rw0524841/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2012,johnnyboyz,6," Hysteria aside, this is actually worth the time; a messy and full-of-mayhem piece covering several bases at once as well as certain others I'm not even sure it knows exist.
","There's Something About Mary is a healthy mix of content which doesn't really work with that of rounded, authentic laughs; of situational comedy which is most certainly at times very funny with that of meaner, cruder humour which most certainly is not. The whole thing just about forges together into a film worth one's time, although looses energy when its lead does indeed catch up with a particular girl whom he has always liked, but has nary seen for the best part of ten years. The film is well worth the effort when the humour revolving around a case of two separate instances of deceptive identity is in full flow; other things, such as dramatic reveals and twists feel present more for the absurd pomp and circumstance of it all, do not work as well. Irregardless, the film's odd air of genre hybridisation, as classical Hollywood-era noir appears to crash head on with latter-part 20th Century gross out comedic laughs, is infectious at the best times and only moderately annoying at the worst ‚Äì it boils down into something worth seeing.",/review/rw0524841/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 1998,foOki,9," --a breath of fresh air---
","come on guys, cameron diaz ain't THAT pretty, and the gross out points arn't THAT gross but this movie IS goddam funny. Go out and watch it and just laugh yourself stupid. One thing though, you can't compare this to dumb & dumber due to the fact that in that movie the main characters were MEANT to be stupid and if you went to see the movie hoping otherwise then obviously you missed the point. Personally i felt ""tsam"" reminded me of happy gilmore. anyhow go watch it, if you don't like it then theres no big loss.",/review/rw0524841/?ref_=tt_urv
