10 January 2007,OttoVonB,9," Denzel VS Mexico City... with unexpected heart
","Alcoholic mercenary Creasy (Washington) is all washed-up, until his friend (Walken) finds him a job in Mexico City, as bodyguard for a rich family's little girl Pita (Fanning). The taciturn man and melancholy girl slowly develop a strong bond... that is utterly shattered the day that Pita is kidnapped and that negotiations are sorely mishandled.",/review/rw6430549/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2010,bt-wells99-1,9," Underrated and ignored, but a bit of a classic
","Tony Scott can make good films and bad, personally I think he can be a bit flashy and trashy and his work obviously suffers in comparison with that of his rather famous brother, but this is quite possibly his best film.",/review/rw6430549/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2004,ecatalan98,10," Mexican Officials Should Be Killed
","I loved this movie. I'm a Mexican and was in the least offended by it. In fact, I think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over Mexico. It's a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse. It angers me to read in the news how killers, kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells. We should have someone like Creasy, Denzel Washington's character. A bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante. Kidnapping is flourishing industry down here (at least in the big cities). I actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the one's Creasy did his fine job upon. That would be so marvelous (Sorry, I am THAT resentful!). MAN ON FIRE is a gripping film that you can't miss. It might be hard on some of you, if you aren't used to reading subtitles (Mexicans do that ALL the time while watching American movies) but the effort will be well worth it. Some of the editing is a bit fuzzy...kind of like TRAFFIC, remember? (another brilliant take on how corrupt Mexico is). The movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half. I swear you'll be cheering as you watch Denzel Washington dispatch the wrong doers. His performance is nothing short of Excellent. The ending (no spoilers, OK!!!) is a bit sad, but I'm sure you'll like it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the year's best movies. A ""must own"" for a DVD collection! 9* out of 10",/review/rw6430549/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2005,ccthemovieman-1,8," 3 Denzels and 1 Dakota For Your Money
","Here's a gritty, get-the-bad guys revenge story starring a relentless and rough Denzel Washington. He's three personalities here: a down-and-out-low-key-now drunk- former mercenary, then a loving father-type person to a little girl and then a brutal maniac on the loose seeking answers and revenge.",/review/rw6430549/?ref_=tt_urv

","Man on Fire is directed by Tony Scott and adapted to screenplay by Brian Helgeland from the novel of the same name written by A.J. Quinell. It stars Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Marc Anthony, Rachael Ticotin, Radha Mitchell, Christopher Walken, Giancarlo Giannini, Mickey Rourke and Jesús Ochoa. Music is scored by Harry Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Paul Cameron.",/review/rw6430549/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2004,MovieAddict2016,," One of the best thrillers in years; a hard-as-nails revenge flick with Washington in top form.
","I hate preachy revenge flicks. I pay money to go see a revenge movie, I want revenge -- not some tough guy learning that killing is bad, etc. Seriously, if I wanted a sermon on the importance of turning the other cheek, I'd either go to church or rent an eco-friendly Steven Seagal movie.",/review/rw6430549/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2006,littlemartinarocena,6," The Editing Massacre
","A riveting introduction, powerful performances and yet, I couldn't quite connect. The trendy editing, I hope, it's just a moronic phase that movies are going through to be outgrow soon, very soon. All the dramatic tension vanishes as the editor plays around with the visuals. Why? If you have characters played by the likes of Denzel Washington, why the need to hit us over the head with a self conscious blow of irrational cutting taking me out of the movie completely and forcing me to see the movie as a movie, the actors as actors and the drama as sheer fiction. Washington is superb. Slowly but surely I'm warming up to the man. I've always admired his performances but there was something about the actor, a veil of arrogance perhaps, that stopped me from getting closer. Here, his personal torment and his warming up to Dakota Fanning took me completely until the smart ass editing ruined everything.",/review/rw6430549/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2010,RickHarvey,8," A emotional ride
","This film contains the one ingredient that all revenge movies should have and that is true emotion. Sorrow, love, laughter , anger. There are so many emotions thrown into this film. From start to finish this film is immensely captivating. The plot on paper sounds like the usually rubbish that is mostly thrown In the faces of the audiences but don't be mistaken, this film is powerful. Washington as always puts on a great performance.",/review/rw6430549/?ref_=tt_urv

10 May 2004,virek213,7," Vengeance In Mexico City
","Although released among a flock of revenge-minded action flicks (KILL BILL VOL. 2; THE PUNISHER; WALKING TALL), MAN ON FIRE works as well as it does thanks in large part to the always-watchable Denzel Washington, one of the best actors around today.",/review/rw6430549/?ref_=tt_urv

","In Mexico City, the former CIA assassin and presently an alcoholic decadent man John Creasy (Denzel Washington) is hired by the industrialist Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony), with the recommendation of his old friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken), to be the bodyguard of his young daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Pita changes the behavior of the cold Creasy, making him live and smile again, and he feels a great affection for her.

25 July 2012,kosmasp,7," Denzel on a mission
","This is a remake of an 80s movie. But before you go all out and yell at Hollywood not being able to make unique new movies, consider this: The original wasn't that good to begin with. And frankly I'd rather have them remake a movie that had a strong central idea but wasn't executed as well (for whatever reason that might have occurred, money/time/actors/filmmakers), than make something ridiculous and try to sell it to us as the best thing ever.",/review/rw6430549/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2005,sblenkharn,10," Riveting viewing!
","Certainly one of the finest movies I have seen for quite some time. Exquisite direction and flawless acting make this a very entertaining and often moving film. Denzel Washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date, and the rest of the cast perform beautifully. Christopher Walken is of course superb in his part although he did not appear as often as I would have liked. A story of ultimate greed that backfires is offset against a childs innocence and love. This is also a film for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets, rockets and revenge. The location of Mexico City adds a feel of seediness and corruption which in itself is an eye opener. All in all, a truly gripping film from beginning to end. Highly recommended!",/review/rw6430549/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2005,Buddy-51,7," flawed but gripping crime thriller
","You know you're in for something different when a movie has Christopher Walken playing the part of a professional hit man - and he isn't even one of the bad guys! Although it could do with some judicious trimming here and there, ""Man on Fire"" is a generally effective crime drama that ranges in tone from the openly sentimental to the downright brutal - and just about every tone imaginable in between.",/review/rw6430549/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2005,kourgon,10," Perfect...Just Perfect. Do yourselves a favor and watch it but...
","...dont read any plot summaries because in words the plot might seem trivial, brain-dead and pointless. The film is excellent, the acting by both Denzel and Dakota (she will go sky high, trust me on that)are just fabulous, and the plot is mind blowing. Actually ""fabulous"" is a small word to use for such talented actors. The film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional, a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film. If you are fond of both actors and of somewhat deranged films, you still haven't watched your favorite one yet...Trust me, in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling. The film is awesome, see it, rent it, buy it or whatever...just don't miss it",/review/rw6430549/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's amazing, the Movie too but that in a moment, that People go to see a Tony Scott Film and then complain about the frantic Editing and the constantly moving Camera and the Ultra-Stylish Direction. This IS Tony Scott. It's what made him an always interesting Director. The pulsating rhythm and the flourishes that have now become clichéd is a Style He helped create.",/review/rw6430549/?ref_=tt_urv

","How is this films rated so badly by critics? I have seen this film 4 times now and every time I watch it, I realise more and more that is it an absolute classic! The way the film was made is so unique and I love how it has been edited to have this intense feel. The music was beautiful and the violent scenes were brutal!",/review/rw6430549/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2005,mjbridges82,6," A film of two halves.
","Based on the novel of the same name by the pseudonymous AJ Quinnell, which is itself alleged to be based around true events, Man On Fire has previously been brought to the big screen in a 1987 European production by French director Elie Chouraqui. At it's heart, a simple revenge fable, Man On Fire follows the fortunes of a formerly accomplished military man known simply as Creasy, that's Creasy with a C, not a G as it sporadically sounds in the movie. Portrayed in this adaptation by Denzel Washington, Creasy is an amiable if evasive character, clearly troubled by a shadowy past of contentious moral value. This exhibits itself in a pervasively melancholy facial expression and an eagerness to spend rather too much time with his good friend Jack Daniels. It's only through the ever watchable Christopher Walken's character Rayburn, a friend and former colleague, that the viewer is afforded any insight into Creasy's character or past. After we're explicitly informed of the prolific rate of kidnappings in South American states, a bearded, bottle hitting Creasy is cajoled by Rayburn into taking a job as a bodyguard in his adopted home, Mexico. He's immediately hired by the unconvincing couple of Samuel and Lisa Ramos, played by Jennifer Lopez casualty Marc Anthony and Neighbours alumnus Radha Mitchell, to protect their little girl Pita, played by Dakota Fanning. Of course Pita is summarily abducted, Creasy is riddled with bullets, and the subsequent ransom drop is botched, ostensibly meaning curtains for the little girl. Well Creasy needed something to burn about, you didn't think it was about visit to the clap clinic did you? The rest of the film depicts a largely irrelevant criminal network being dispatched in creatively gruesome ways until the inexorable showdown with the architect of the kidnapping.",/review/rw6430549/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2004,headhunter46,," Demons within and demons without.
","Denzel Washington plays the role of an ex-marine who is battling demons from within himself, the memories of the horrible things that occur in war. We depend on men like him to defend our country, and we send them to other parts of the world in the name of freedom. We train them to be cool-headed, efficient killers because sometimes that is the only way to stop the selfish, evil ones who would destroy decency and freedom with no regard for human rights.

1 February 2005,skiprodgers,10," Outstanding Movie
","This is by far one of the better made movies and  didn't leave me disappointed at all. The sound track along with finely  shot hand-held camera work was exquisite . The are always chances a  movie won't hold ones beliefs as well as another, but I felt that  rhythm of this picture and the timing was excellent. Dakota Fanning is  rapidly becoming a staple in movie that require a child with an old  soul personality and she has never disappointed me with her talent. As  for Mr. Washington and of course Christopher Walken they both exceed  the challenge of showing the darkest sides of humanity trying to move  to the light.",/review/rw6430549/?ref_=tt_urv
