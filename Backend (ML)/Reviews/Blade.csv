","This movie is not among the best but still has more to offer than the average thriller. This is mostly due to its cast and fine thriller concept, that however doesn't always gets handled well.",/review/rw3562517/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2007,Special-K88,," good story that doesn't fully deliver in the end
","Detective Alex Cross is an experienced, astute forensic psychologist. He's brought from D.C. to Durham to aid in the investigation of a slippery criminal mastermind with a track record for abducting young women who are both beautiful and talented. It becomes personal when one of the abductees is his niece, and he enlists local doctor and former victim Kate McTiernan (Judd) who escaped the same perpetrator and is the only living person who can identify him. Stylish, atmospheric, well-crafted thriller holds your interest, with some effective twists and strong performances from Freeman and Judd, but it builds to a climax that doesn't quite payoff. Still, a respectable showing for all those involved. **Â½",/review/rw3562517/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2005,NewEnglandPat,8," Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd
","This suspense thriller is every bit as good as James Patterson's fine novel and has great chemistry between Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd. The sole plot is Freeman's search for two serial kidnappers and killers who snatch beautiful and accomplished young women, including Freeman's niece. The two killers try to outdo each other as they seize and destroy their trophy captives. As with most mysteries, this one has the usual red herrings, false leads and dead ends. Freeman is excellent as Alex Cross and heroine Judd is a study in grit and survival and is very effective in a finely nuanced role. The supporting cast is also great in a movie that has a leisurely pace and several great action scenes as it peaks towards its conclusion. The North Carolina location lensing, music score and cinematography are all very good.",/review/rw3562517/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2000,michaelRokeefe,7," Thrilling mystery. Torrid and touching.
",A serial killer is collecting strong and attractive young women. He is also attracted to their talents and wisdom. It may be that he is holding his living trophies in underground cells. It may be that he is stalking on both coasts; in South Carolina and in California. Does this diabolical deranged man have a partner in crime; or does he have a copy cat competing with him?,/review/rw3562517/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2006,ccthemovieman-1,6," A One-Look Movie Not Up To Standards Of The Two Stars
","With established stars that I like - Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd - and a different story angle (two killers operating in tandem, one on each coast) I keep thinking this thriller is better than what it is, and each time I watch I am disappointed. After three viewings, I've finally had enough. I should have quit while I was ahead.",/review/rw3562517/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2010,jzappa,7," A Sufficient Mainstream Psychological Cop Thriller with Particularly Good Lead Performances
","In this modest enough psycho-thriller, once more Freeman plays a policeman on the path of a perverse serial killer, and again the shade is bottomless and the antagonist is ingenious and the atrocities are intended to convey some sort of perverted meanings. Though as commercial and formula-driven as it is, the movie's not a rehash but a fertile piece, based on a Patterson book about a criminal who, the Freeman character perceives, is not killing his quarries, but accumulating them. Often said by moviegoers to be the actor whose presence has the most authority of any of his generation, Freeman has an exceptional bearing on the screen, a particular determination that we believe. He never looks or sound like he's pretending. He never gives a superficial, obvious or distracted impression, and even in movies that aren't that good, he's not guilty by association: You feel he's genuine even as a film may capsize around him.",/review/rw3562517/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2004,red_core,6," great acting from the lead, uninspired plot exposition
","If you like serial killer films that like to tax your brain, you should probably give this movie a look (exactly the reasoning I was following when I picked this up at a video store). Chances are, you'll be entertained by what you see. Just don't expect this one to be a nailbiter like Silence of the Lambs or Se7en. This one comes across as more than a little forced, at times, something that can't be levelled against those two superior films.",/review/rw3562517/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2000,Xophianic,9," Dark, suspenseful, fantastic
","I didn't really know much about this movie when I saw that it was coming on HBO. I just decided ""what the hell"" and watched it. Besides, Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. After a few minutes of KISS THE GIRLS, I was instantly glued to the television. It was pretty dark and very suspenseful, but I truly liked it.",/review/rw3562517/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2010,TheLittleSongbird,7," Loses steam towards the end, but the cast and photography help carry an otherwise compelling thriller
","Kiss the Girls has its problems, but it isn't a bad film by all means. Actually it is decent, compelling viewing. Starting with its problems, the script does have a tendency to become mechanical, and while the film's story starts off very well and really intriguing, it loses steam at the end for two reasons. The film's logic and credibility does go out of the window as the film's conclusion looms nearer, and then the culprit I felt got revealed too early. On the other hand, the film is very atmospherically shot, the cinematography is really very good, and the music is suspenseful. Plus we have great performances from the ever reliable Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd, as well as from Cary Elwes and some skillful direction. Overall, it is a compelling and intriguing thriller that ran out of steam too early, but there is much to enjoy. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw3562517/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2005,rmax304823,4," You've already seen it.
","The niece of a Washington, D. C., police psychologist disappears from her campus in North Carolina. The psychologist (Freeman) goes down to help out the local cops. Shortly, another young woman (Judd), an intern at the local Regional Center is likewise kidnapped. We follow her story as she is taken to an underground dungeon, drugged and bound and raped. She escapes. Judd and Freeman join forces. They match the local kidnappings, which sometimes end in murder, with others that seem to follow the same pattern in California. They fly to California and discover that a cosmetic surgeon who lives in Marina Del Ray (all L.A. doctors live in Marina Del Ray) has ordered a huge supply of the rarely used drug that was used on Judd during her captivity.",/review/rw3562517/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2000,psycho_153,6," PRETTY GOOD THRILLER!!
","Pretty good thriller. Lots of twists and turns to keep your attention. Great performances from Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman. The story is Washington DC detective Dr. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) travels to North Carolina to investigate the apparent kidnapping of his niece (Gina Ravera). Aided by escaped kidnapee Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd), Cross hunts down the kidnapper, who operates under the pseudonym ""Cassanova"". Pretty good watch, nice performance by casanova all up a good movie.",/review/rw3562517/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2008,HelloTexas11,5," so-so thriller
","What 'Kiss The Girls' has going for it mainly is Morgan Freeman. What's the old saying? He would be interesting reciting the phone book. Freeman has the kind of screen presence that other actors only dream of possessing. He is calm, reassuring, magnetic... he is wise without acting like a know-it-all; maturity and decency seem to radiate from him. It's interesting to ponder whether Freeman is really that good of an actor, or if he simply possesses an overdose of charisma, like Errol Flynn. In any event, he's the best thing about 'Kiss The Girls', a standard-issue sicko-on-the-loose-kidnapping-beautiful-women thriller. It's basically a rehash of 'Silence of the Lambs' without the Hannibal Lecter character. And without the style. Much is hinted at and some of the dialogue is explicit, but that's as far as 'Kiss The Girls' goes. Visually, it's really pretty dull. Good thing it has Morgan Freeman to aim the camera at. Ashley Judd plays the one who gets away, a kidnap victim who escapes the psycho's dungeon. (And it is literally a dungeon. No basement or shed. A real dungeon.) She is also a brilliant doctor. See, this sick creep likes to kidnap INTELLIGENT and INDEPENDENT women. No airheads for him. Unfortunately, this little twist in the usual plot provides no new ideas or fresh situations, unless you count Freeman's daughter playing the violin. Judd is adequate in the not-very-believable role; she strikes me as a female Keanu Reeves, something sort of android-ish about her. And good old Cary Elwes (warning- spoiler coming) is- surprise!- the psychotic kidnapper. Like we were going to believe he was a sincere, good old boy policeman. Poor Cary Elwes- he is really typecast. But I can see why. He just has that kind of face. 'Kiss The Girls' seems a lot like your typical TV-movie of the week; it's what the critics call an 'agreeable time-filler'... but it DOES have Morgan Freeman in it.",/review/rw3562517/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2016,seymourblack-1,7," Hunting Down A Killer Casanova
","Based on James Patterson's best selling novel of the same name, ""Kiss The Girls"" is a profoundly disturbing story about an investigation into a series of kidnappings. The villain is a creepy psychopath, a serial rapist and a killer who kidnaps young women and is then deluded enough to think that he can win their affection. An eerie atmosphere prevails throughout and some interesting characters, tense moments and unexpected developments ensure that the action remains thoroughly engrossing right through to the movie's gripping climax.",/review/rw3562517/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2020,Med-Jasta,10," Great movie!
","I haven't seen this since 97. Today as I was wondering what to watch on this rainy Monday, a dark thriller from the 90s sounded good and I got more than I bargained for. This was a great movie! Very well written with good characters, good acting and a good story. The best part is that this doesn't follow your typical story structure. You think you know where this is going and the story unfolds uniquely.",/review/rw3562517/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,4," Forgettable serial killer outing with a derivative killer
","The best thing you can say about this predictable thriller is that it passes the time amiably enough, thanks to some fast pacing. Otherwise, it's nothing we haven't seen before, with Morgan Freeman doing his usual detective shtick (see 2001's ALONG CAME A SPIDER for more of this); a post-SEVEN world populated by dark, shadowy sets and a disturbed killer at the centre of the crimes. Although Freeman's investigation is kept interesting and there are some nice, original clues and twists to go along with, it's all very light and fluffy slick stuff which doesn't get the viewer involved. The editing is occasionally poor and the script confusing, not giving us enough time to register what characters are saying before dashing on in a mad panic to the next scene.",/review/rw3562517/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2009,martin.selway,4," Plot is a load of rubbish
","Lets start with the positive - Morgan Freeman did a great acting job, but that alone was not enough to save this film from the trash heap. There are so many unbelievable elements to this film, I just don't know where to start. Heres a few: Are we meant to believe that half a dozen women are being held captive and the local police are doing nothing to find them? The idea that Freeman and his buddy from Washington DC take on the enquiry all on their own and don't tell anyone they are staking out this suspect is daft. The real killer turns out to be a detective working on the case - just how did he spend all the time with the girls when he was also working full time on a murder enquiry? The murderer has distinctive writing and sent Freeman a note which is so easy to match up with the detective's handwriting it's just not believable!",/review/rw3562517/?ref_=tt_urv

","I only watched this film last week but I'm struggling to recall even the basics of the plot, which says a lot about how forgettable and underwhelming it is.

5 October 1999,zvelf-2,2," This is one idiotic film
","This movie was so contrived, all one can do is throw one's arms up in the air. All the characters suffer from ""I'm going to do the stupidest thing I can in this scene"" syndrome. Morgan Freeman's character would have lost his job half way through the film for doing what he did, going out of his jurisdiction, withholding information from the FBI, giving a potential kidnapper a legal out. And that Ashley Judd's character could just tag along was completely ridiculous. Why didn't one particular character come up with the underground slave pit earlier? Um, because the movie would have and should have ended 10 minutes in.",/review/rw3562517/?ref_=tt_urv

","Detective and forensic Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) goes to Durham, North Carolina because her niece is reported as missing. Cross then learns from Detective Nick Ruskin (Cary Elwes) that she is the latest in a series of young women kidnapped and at the same time Doctor Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd) is kidnapped too. When she re-awakens from a drugged state, she discovers that is held hostage along with many women by a masked man that calls himself Casanova, and she manages to escape without hurting herself after jumping from a cliff. Soon, she joins forces with Cross for tracking down the captor, who instead is a collector unless his victims fail to follow his rules, and that there is still time to save the other imprisoned women as long as they are obedient to Doctor William Rudolph (Tony Goldwyn). When Rudolph ends shot, it's revealed after a while that Ruskin was in cahoots with him all the time. Ruskin will end up helding Kate hostage, not long after Cross arrives and with the help of a milk box for avoiding an explosion, shoots Ruskin.",/review/rw3562517/?ref_=tt_urv
