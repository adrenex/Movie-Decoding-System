29 October 2020,stellafoster,7," Coronavirus has broken me
","It's official; this pandemic has broken me because not only did I choose to watch this romcom. I... enjoyed it. I'm a horror and crime fan so I can't understand what's going on. This film is funny after a while and the 2 leads definitely have chemistry. I actually (jeeze I can't believe I'm going to say this) wanted them to get together. Of course, it could be that I'm trying out gin properly for the first time in my life, which I also normally hate, so I've added a mix of other booze to make it drinkable. So, overall; a funny, feelgood film to watch during a pandemic. If you're drunk and expecting to die soon. Cheers!",/review/rw6216787/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2020,toddsgraham,7," Overall, a pretty good romcom
","It is no Richard Curtis film (e.g., Notting Hill, Love Actually) but a pretty good romantic comedy nonetheless. The acting was good; Emma Roberts was good and so was the supporting cast. The storyline was what I expected but it kept me engaged thru out, and I even shedded a tear or two during the last scene. If you are looking for 'depth' you should probably choose another genre of film. Though, to be fair, the film does touch on a very important issue facing many Western democracies today, that is, loneliness. But this film will cheer you up for 90 minutes at least.",/review/rw6216787/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2020,alshamari-marwa,7," Funny cheesy movie
","I haven't seen a good comedy romance in a while, yes it is cheesy but sometimes we just need these movies you know the end, but it was original and it was funny and romance, so i do recommend it .",/review/rw6216787/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2021,arod_85,8," Not sure why, but I loved it!
",This movie is a cliche that kinda makes fun of cliches. It's nothing original and a lot of the jokes you've seen been before. But for some reason I absolutely loved it. One of the best Netflix romcoms I've seen.,/review/rw6216787/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2020,Gordon-11,," Great chemistry
","The chemistry between the two leads is so great. They are very convincing as lovers, which makes it particularly enjoyable to watch.",/review/rw6216787/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2020,tygertygerburningbright,7," Yes it's cliché but really fun
",I wouldn't think I'd like it so much because it's a kinda cheesy rom-com but it made me feel good. Might be about the holidays. There were some hilarious moments too. Definitely worth watching.,/review/rw6216787/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2020,lillyhms,8," Cliché RomCom
","Well, basically all we need for holiday is Cliché Holiday RomCom. That's why 'tis the season we're gonna have similar romcom story with different actors yet we still love it. And this movie is actually way better than your average holiday movie. The chemistry between the two main lead is on, and oh their visual are adorable.",/review/rw6216787/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2020,LinaInverse23,5," So tired of these stories
","Same basic crud, they always gotta have a fight near the end, they break up. Then the character realizes they love the other, they rush to the airport or make a speech, and all is well. So very tired of these awful tropes.",/review/rw6216787/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2020,leftbanker-1,1," Another Paint-By-Numbers Rom-Com To Avoid
",There must be a computer program that spits out the scripts for all of these rom-coms. You just mix and match the elements you are looking for and the program does the rest.,/review/rw6216787/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2020,Marynewcomb2013,1," Hallmark meets kindergarten writing!!
","The heading sums this failure up!! It's a Hallmark basic plot, (similar to Hitched For The Holidays) meets a kindergartner who is learning to write!! What more can be said!! Netflix needs to get a whole new group of creative people in & start from scratch!!",/review/rw6216787/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2021,jk-692-236394,2," Do you really need to have a 11 year old say F-ck?
","Gratuitous swearing galore, and lots of crude going on. I feel like when writers have a lack of ideas and talent, they resort to crude sex jokes and swearing. Not a ""smart"" romcom. Emma Roberts lacks charisma. This could have been so much better with better writing.",/review/rw6216787/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2020,punch_p,4," As amusing as a ""hand-job,"" and about as intimate.
","Predictability doesn't have to be a sin when it comes to the often paint-by-the-numbers world of romantic comedy, but this awkward combination of expectation and disdain for it make for a film only fleetingly worthy of celebration.",/review/rw6216787/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2020,m-47826,1," Awful. Another mind numbing production.
","Not funny, with stereotypical, yet extremely unlikeable characters. That become cheesy, once they drop the jaded and sarcastic act. This is another « new generation » movie, trying to avoid every cliché in the book, while listing them one by one. And it has Netflix written all over. So globalist it's ridiculous. Not even the semi decent cast could salvage this PC humor mess. Ok, the Halloween part was trying to be funny, but it's only five minutes in a 1h44 movie...",/review/rw6216787/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2020,cardsrock,4," HoliHATE it
","The fact this film tries to call out other rom coms for overdone cliches is rich. I think Hallmark might even have passed on this garbage. Discount Chris Hemsworth and Emma Roberts are decent enough, but are surrounded by mediocrity. I hate that movies like this feel they have to follow this stupid Hollywood formula without any deviation, so that the easy-to-please masses won't cry. So many scenes are just outlandish and stupid too, like they aren't even remotely believable. This was not an enjoyable experience. That is all.",/review/rw6216787/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2020,vandrist,6," Cute, with a good personality
","Don't you just love cheesy rom coms? With everything going on right now, this is a great quarantine movie. A story about not being alone during the holidays and just needing someone to spend those days with to not have to go about it alone. I enjoyed how fun and cheesy and cute that this movie was. It's not going to win any awards, but it is a great start in the run of movies that will get you in the mood for the holidays.",/review/rw6216787/?ref_=tt_urv

24 April 2021,catamella,2," Terrible
","I simply couldn't stand it. This story line has been made one million times already. Sometimes they manage to come up with small elements that add to a new movie, but this was an exact copy of everything that has been done before. Bad acting, bad performance, incredibly stupid senseless story line. I like some cheesy rom coms, but this was just plain awful even for the genre.",/review/rw6216787/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2020,Molly_flower,8," Surprisingly witty
","I am not a romcom fan AT ALL but not only did I watch this movie, I laughed pretty much all the way through it. Of course much of it was predictable but I feel like the main character kind of addressed that herself subliminally through a joke in one scene. A light hearted fun movie with some genuine jokes. As someone that pretty much only watches thriller and horrors, I'll admit this movie was a good laugh.",/review/rw6216787/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2020,butravi,1," Skip this holiday irritant
","It's not easy to mess up a rom com, with cliches. But somehow the director totally messed up.
Actually not much com or comedy in this one, and romance is pushed in forcibly, but doesn't work.
Script seems to be made up in pieces by different people, and the climax is one of the worst. Even low budget tv romance movies are better. Emma Roberts is totally mis cast. Even covid boredom is not enough to save this disaster.",/review/rw6216787/?ref_=tt_urv
