10 May 2019,atwiththestars,10," I am truely going to miss the brilliance of this show.
","This show communicates well how the most selfish, petty and arrogant of people are drawn to politics. And what makes it work is that it never mentions parties. This show perfectly captures what both parties are potentially like, and also what most global politics are really about. This is one of the best shows of my lifetime.",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2019,ima_curiousangel-742-386404,10," Utterly vile and sublimely superb
",Having seen all the original aversion in the UK (The Thick Of it) and adoring it... I didn't think it could be topped in sheer poetry of swear words and toe curling insults. Always close to the bone and often vulgar but in the most intelligent and hysterically funny ways - this is absolutely one to binge and turn it up... you will miss some corkers from the deafening laughter in the room if you dont. Not for the faint of heart or easily offended but utterly wonderful right up to the very last episode. It seemed to cram in quite literally every filthy joke and disgraceful insult they'd ever written and not got the chance to use so as not to waste any. And thank God they did!!! No spoilers but just watch it all it's a breath of fresh air in this oh so vanilla TV landscape.,/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2013,generationofswine,10," Fast & Dry
","This is a great example of how comedy should be written. The humor is dry, witty, and fast paced. By the time one joke is sinking in the next one has already arrived & been delivered by an excellent cast that has the good sense to play it straight. I'm forced to give it a ten out of ten, the writers are brilliant & the cast knows how to handle the script.",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv

23 April 2012,Br007,10," Brilliant
","Just saw the first episode of Veep and, if the rest of the series is as good as the opener, HBO has a brilliant series on its hands. Louis-Dreyfus delivers a performance reminiscent of her Elaine days; utilizing every ounce of her talent and pouring her entire body into each moment. It's easily her best work since Seinfeld, and that's no put down of her post Seinfeld work. It's a commentary on just how brilliant she was on that show.",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2012,daniellouthain,10," Contrary to popular belief, this show is hilarious.
","I waited until after the sixth episode to review the show so it had time to germinate and really show the audience its potential before I made judgment. I liked the show from the start, mostly because I love The Thick of It and In the Loop. Now I love this show. ",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2012,steveaherne2000,9," the VEEP get my vote as funniest new show anywhere,
","I was surprised to see only one vote in for this hilarious new show,i always assumed HBO attracted a more discerning kind of watcher,ah well I'm sure word of mouth will do the trick.",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2019,dpoland-76589,10," Smart comedy
","I don't mean to say that people that rate this show low aren't smart. At all. But it is a brilliant mix between dark, clever and raunchy that Veep offers. I love this show (and hated Seinfeld).",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2012,ian80,10," Reopened my account just to score the show high.
","Why are people voting on a show before it's aired? There is no way this deserves a 4.9; however, I'm sure it will go up as actual viewers chime in. I've seen the first episode and I'm hooked already.",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2012,rednblack,10," excellent
","Like the rest of Ianucci's work, this is a fantastic political satire. The reflexive self-serving sycophancy, the arbitrary nature of power, the automatic deferral to the hidden powers behind the throne, the elevation of random dross above real issues (brilliantly lampooned in the pilot when the use of cornstarch forks in the White House becomes a stumbling block to setting up a clean jobs task force) are skillfully portrayed, showing how the dysfunction of the modern arena (especially the media's eye, usually passive but, as in the second episode, sometimes accompanied by a mouthful of vicious teeth) prevents the exercise of power for actual governmental function. None of the characters are perfectly likable, though all are well-played, but somehow the ensemble is endearing. Watch this if you want to see a sharp commentary on the drunken carousel that is politics.",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2019,UniqueParticle,9," Political fun show
","Julia Louis Dreyfus is outstanding and so are many others in it! Lots of fast talking and well written clever dialogue. Now that Veep is over I'll definitely binge a lot of it. Hilarious throughout, one of the best of it's type! Also I avoid most news and political stuff but this is different; quite deserving of it's high praise.",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2019,minister_of_silly_walks,10," Political parody and satire done perfectly!
","One of the best modern U.S. comedy shows is a must see for any comedy fan out there! It is clever, fast paced, incredibly funny and it pokes fun at all of the political tropes we come to expect form politicians all over the world. The cast is just amazing, especially Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the main protagonist Selina Meyer and the standout performance of Tony Hale as series favorite Gary Walsh. There is not a single dull moment in this series as the characters try to establish themselves in the world of D.C. politics where backstabbing and plotting is an everyday occurrence.",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2019,cherold,10," A political Larry Sanders
","In seven seasons, Veep never missed a step. Always hilarious, always savagely cynical, always brilliantly acted, this is one of the best TV sitcoms ever made.",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2019,blanbrn,8," Funny outspoken and brash blunt comedy drama political show that's raunchy and rude!
","Over the course of 7 seasons from time to time on ""HBO"" I've watched some episodes of this crazy and very funny political gem that's well written with wit and humor all while capturing pop culture and the current political climate to it's best nature. The scene catcher of the show is Julia Louis Dreyfus who as Selina Meyer has seen it all in life and the political world. As a former U.S. Senator and vice president the game is then on to the presidency, and Miss Meyer is a real progressive and she fights the unexpected tides of the political game with fire and venom. Also the series is a showcase of Selina's private life and work relationship with staff as it's always a fun juggle with conflict and drama. And I always thought Julia was one sexy lady her Selina character is also sexy as she's a sexy colored bra wearing elegant female political power player who lights it up! Overall funny outspoken series that's fun entertainment that doesn't take things to serious yet it's wit and well written episodes are entertaining.",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2012,anotherclueforyouall,10," Many great laughs, do not give up after the couple of episodes based on The Thick Of It comparisons
","For those who gave up after the first episode or two and are writing this off as 'not as good as The Thick Of it', you're doing yourself a great disservice. ",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2012,pburntproductions,9," This show is hysterical!
","Get the remote, find the rewind button and get ready. Not an episode has gone by where I didn't have to rewind because we missed dialogue over the laughter in the room. In some cases, we just have to re-watch scenes over again for sheer enjoyment of Julia's performance.",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2022,dontakeitpersonal,5," Downhill after season 4
","For me it felt that it wasn't going anywhere after season 4. Up until then, storywise it was okay. Then it went all over the place, touching on all sorts of political subjects, characters all over the place. The character Jonah took off strangely and became much more funny and interesting. It has some good laughs and point of views regarding politics.",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2012,JohnRayPeterson,8," An excellent outlet for your political frustrations. It gets my vote
","As a previous user wrote, there's no way this series can, after just one episode, get a low rating; I too will give high marksfor the moment. Reviews can be updated and modified in time when circumstances dictate. I'll be revisiting this review in time of course, given I've watched the pilot only. In a recent interview of Julia Louis-Dreyfus by Piers Morgan, she was commenting about this new HBO series. She admitted there might be a slight slant pro the democratic point of view, but she readily also admitted that she had a bone to pick with all politicians, republicans and democrats.",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2014,Red_Identity,," Definitely hilarious
","This is just fantastic. I think it starts off a bit rough, but gets better and better as it goes on. The performances are all aces, the writing is on point. It's also incredibly admirable just how the writing is layered out as if it was a drama and never really going for obvious comedy clichés and tropes, and just having the comedy play out naturally instead of like in other comedies. It's all rather well done. Dreyfuss is just perfection here, and like the show always seems to play on the verge of drama. This is a fantastic show that has only gotten better with each season. This is definitely strongly recommended. Go",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2019,nimitberry,10," Great comedy
",A very smart comedy that I believe can only be understood if you have brains and some knowledge of the American political system. I don't know how people can rate this comedy to be worth 1 star . Probably the above conditions would missing,/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2013,winstonfg,10," Ohmigod, a _funny_ American sitcom
","Just when I thought that US TV had terminally lapsed back into smug, pre-MWC, God-bless-America banality when it comes to comedy, along comes 'Veep' to prove me wrong. It's perhaps no surprise that its creator, Armando Iannucci, is a Brit; but the fact is that the subject matter is something that writers like Aaron Sorkin and the late, great George Carlin, have been handling deftly for many years now. And this show definitely has the feeling of an apex that started with things like 'Spin City'.",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2017,NotMoreMovies,3," Just not for me, who knows why
","First off the cast is terrific, and I wanted to like this show, I really did. The plots just...how should put this...stink (aka s--k).",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2012,jay-408-122145,10," I forgot I had Series Link on my Sky box, until now...
","An absolutely superb spin on American back-room politics. I am totally hooked after the first episode, just aired here in Blighty. It's West Wing but with VaVaVoom and top drawer comedy. Julia is incredibly good in the role and the supporting cast are all inch-perfect. Really hope the series lives up to the high expectations set by this first episode.",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2020,sparsh-hardik,10," The best thing on recent politics
","Selina, surrounded by some incompetent allies, looks as a self-destructive person at first, but then the opportunity hits her and she emerges as a politician who is kind of a nightmare for any democracy. Self-centric Selina, as if her personality were there to reinforce her dwarf-like figure, is the face of many politicians of modern age, to the world who are merely a two dimensional cut-out deliberately nurtured with the help of the media.",/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2014,robin_sayer,10," Brilliantly Written Satire
",I didn't expect this to work as well as it does. Knowing the writer for British comedy such as the Thick of It and Alan Partridge - I thought the US version would lose some of its snap. However I shouldn't have worried. Armando Iannucci remained at the helm for this and it really works.,/review/rw3020643/?ref_=tt_urv
