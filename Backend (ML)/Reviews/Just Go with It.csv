23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Gleefully fun and thoroughly entertaining.
","'Wanted' is a film that's having too much fun not to like. Who cares about the impossibility of bullet bending when most audiences accept superheroes with inhuman powers and strengths based on comic book characters. As with those comic book films, it's just a work of fiction and fantasy, and since 'Wanted' doesn't take itself at all seriously, then you can suspend utter disbelief. The casting and performances are all spot on, above all James McAvoy who delivers one of his best performances in his career so far, even if the might not be the best film he's been in. Stylish, funny, competently directed and paced, this is a great action flick with an ordinary story that is more than the sum of its parts due to slick a execution.",/review/rw1920031/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2008,brando647,8," Dark Humor and Non-Stop Action, Fun Summer Film
","I know there is a lot of hate going around for this movie (though it oddly manages to maintain a decent rating despite the nay-saying...) but I would really urge people to watch this movie before letting the opinions of others affect their views on it. Sure, the movie takes some liberties with plot and, obviously, physics, but it makes for a fun action/popcorn movie. It is, after all, just a movie. After seeing this film, I would say it was one of the most fun action films of 2008. It's got plenty of violence and stylized action with a dose of sexuality and a decent plot...Wesley Gibson is a miserable account manager with a dead-end life until he is approached by the beautiful Fox, who informs him that his father was a master assassin who had been murdered days before. Gibson is recruited into an assassin's guild known as the Fraternity to hunt down and kill his father's murderer.",/review/rw1920031/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2008,raypdaley182,1," Very weak!
",Suspend all disbelief. There's not a single element of realism in this movie & it's a very sad attempt to try & make a comic into a movie then failing badly as the source material clearly wasn't strong enough.,/review/rw1920031/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2008,Anonymous_Maxine,9," Hey wait a minute, what HAVE I done lately?
","I wasn't excited to see Wanted. I'm back in America for the summer and I was going to the movies with a friend, and she has what can only be called an unhealthy obsession with Angelina Jolie, so of course this was at the top of the list of movies to see. Personally I don't understand a lot of the hype about her as an actor, but I have to admit she looks good with a gun so I decided to check out the movie.",/review/rw1920031/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2008,c_p_c,7," Not a bit of substance...but, who cares?
","Putting it bluntly, 'WANTED' was a rather formulaic and predictable outing. A loserly, office shut-in with the help of a hot babe learns about his past and is suddenly thrust into the world of assassination, a world of flipping cars, extreme gun fights, and mind-altering stunts, thus shedding every bit of his shy, weak self. This we've all seen before.",/review/rw1920031/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2009,axlrhodes,6," Wanted left me wanting.
","For the first half hour Wanted felt like a trailer.Adapted from a graphic novel the film never seems to settle,the actors seem ill at ease with the material and the impatience on the directors part leaves us with a messy hackneyed film of action set pieces and sci fi mumbo jumbo inbetween. The film tries far too hard to be cool which is a shame because im sure it could have been a better film if things would have just been done with a little less haste.James McAvoy,so convincing in Last King Of Scotland is hard to like in this role.Morgan Freeman seems totally non interested but to be fair hes given virtually nothing to do and just serves as filler between action scenes.Angelina Jolie is the real star of this film,she has astounding presence as an actress and suits the action genre,its just a shame we cant find a truly memorable action film for her to star in.In summary Wanted is a fast paced but legless action film that promises much but delivers very little.It leaves you wanting.",/review/rw1920031/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2008,the-movie-guy,10," I Wanted a Little More
","(Synopsis) Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is a neurotic accounts manager who works in a small cubical filling out billing reports day end and day out. He allows his boss and his girlfriend to walk all over him. To cope with his life, he takes anti-anxiety pills by the bottle full. Wesley has no desire to change his humdrum life, but one day while getting more pills at the drug store, he meets a beautiful woman in black, Fox (Angelina Jolie) who changes his life forever. Fox was sent to protect Wesley from the man who had just killed his father. Wesley thought his father had died soon after he was born. Fox tells Wesley, ""that your father died yesterday on the rooftop of the Metropolitan Building and you are next"". Wesley is recruited into the ""Fraternity,"" a secret society of assassins that his father was a member. Fox must train Wesley to bring out his special powers that he was born with in order to avenge his father's death.",/review/rw1920031/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2008,Jacques98,2," Another boring action movie.
","I think the reason I don't like action movies very much is because they tend to be just dramas in disguise, and Wanted is nothing different. It's hard for me to remember an action movie that actually had actionsuch as in Aliens and Kill Billand wasn't just a Lifetime TV drama about how the main character has family problems and he tries to fix them . . . oh, and then his car blows up. Or in this case, he has family problems, he gets in a gun fight, and he tries to fix his family problems again.",/review/rw1920031/?ref_=tt_urv

11 September 2008,bob the moo,," Silly nonsense that just about suffices as post-pub action fodder but nothing more than that
","Wesley Gibson is a simple office worker tired with his life and past the point of hoping for more. Before you can say ""hang on didn't The Matrix do this but better?"" Gibson is approached by a woman claiming he is the son of a famed killer with near-supernatural abilities and that he has them too. It takes a few gun battles to make him believe the story, but Gibson is soon under the wing of the Fraternity, a group of super-assassins under the leadership of the shadowy Sloan, who kill based on the thread patterns sown by a magic loom (no, really). Gibson begins training for his ultimate task  taking down the man who killed his father all those years ago.",/review/rw1920031/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2008,ccthemovieman-1,2," Garbage Is Still Garbage, No Matter How Much 'Style'
","I tend to give great ""visual movies"" a look, even if there is a 50-50 chance the film might be ""rubbish,"" as the Brits say. Sometimes I am delighted to find a stylish and well-made film or one that is goofy but harmless and fun. Other times, as in this instance, I find just one thing: garbage, as we Americans say.",/review/rw1920031/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2009,ed_two_o_nine,7," Wanted dead and alive
","Right first things first this is an extremely enjoyable action movie, but for it to work for you must suspend your sense of disbelief. With this done there is much to be enjoyed here. The premise of an agent order of assassin weavers is lets face it pretty ropey, and I am not sure how true it is to the comic source material (which I will probably dig out at some point), and Morgan Freeman is really playing it by numbers here. But we have some amazing and original action sequences that really do move the movie on at a frenetic pace. Yes we can see the massive influence of 'The Matrix' and 'Fight Club' and lets just hope if there are sequels they do not go the way of the shoddy follow ups to the Matrix. I like the fact that some of the characters are played by different actors than your normal action movie types, though to be honest I am not sure about McAvoy's American accent, though he handles everything else well. Still much better than your average action movie and worth repeat viewings if you are a fan of the genre.",/review/rw1920031/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2009,andy-1978,8," Top Easy Watching Action Movie
","This is a very easy to watch action packed movie. It delved into your imagination and as long as you are not expecting a true to life action drama you should love it. I am not normally struck on the matrix style movies but I really liked this film. The story is not be taken too seriously, just go with the flow of the film and watch the stunts and special effects. Putting Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman in the movie had to be a good move with the box office bucks. But the ace card for this movie in my opinion is James McAvoy who plays the geeky guy who turns into a top assassin. At first I did not recognize James McAvoy from his previous roles like "" The last King of Scotland "" and ' Wimbledon "". When I did realize it was the same actor I understood what a fab actor he truly is. He portrays his character with absolute ease. His transition in his role from the start of the movie to his ending character is class. James I am a true fan !! The movie is a good watch if you are into this type of movie.",/review/rw1920031/?ref_=tt_urv

27 June 2008,lothd,1," Ultra-brutal action posing as entertainment
","Mindless action films abound and can be fun. This is not a mindless action film, but its ""mind"" caters to nerdy dreams of becoming a more-than-human being. Wouldn't we all like to suddenly have $3.5 million in our bank accounts, tell off our extremely annoying boss (is there any other kind?) and get trained as an ultra-assassin? Then just shoot everybody they tell you to or have a quick case of conscience, then shoot them - cool? Not.",/review/rw1920031/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2010,Rectangular_businessman,1," If only you could rate in the negatives...
","I hated everything about this horrible film. I found it to be terrible, muddled, annoying and dumb. It was even worse than 300 and The Spirit. I wasn't surprised to discover that this movie was directed by the same guy who made ""Night Watch"" and ""Day Watch"", both horrible and poorly made films with an incoherent plot.

15 July 2008,fertilecelluloid,3," Boring crud on a lavish budget
","There is nothing I despise more than how popular culture has redefined ""cool"". In days not so long ago, ""cool"" meant an absence of heat. If something was cool, it was tepid, mild, even subdued. Now, ""cool"" in movies is when you kill somebody and behave indifferently to your action. A ""cool"" character blows a hundred people away, but acts if he just stepped out for a smoke. I resent the crushing of human emotions. I'm peeved at a culture that finds emotional indifference attractive. I like cinematic killing as much as, if not more than, the next guy, but the films I love focus on emotions associated with killing. If they don't focus on the emotions of killing or raping, they don't depict emotionless killers as cool. One example of the former is Chow Yun Fatt's hit-man character in John Woo's ""The Killer"". He is struggling with the moral decisions of his profession. He gets involved with the nightclub singer because he feels guilt for having blinded her. His internal struggle is the key to the film's emotional power. I preface my review of 'Wanted"" with the above rant because ""Wanted"" annoyed me. It is a slick, expensive, disposable action movie that equates killing and destruction with ""cool"". I know it's just a movie, but so what!, it's an empty movie, and I'd like it more if it didn't pretend that human emotions don't exist. The special effects are impressive (they should be for the budget!) and the performances are OK, but the climax is rubbish and the attempt at being meaningful is a dead loss because we've spent ninety minutes with character who are little more than stick figures with pistols. Ultimately, this film is boring, and I can't help thinking that gamers, who'd probably prefer an interactive experience, anyway, will have seen it all before.",/review/rw1920031/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2008,whlrguy,8," To The Extreme
","I just got back from an advanced screening of Wanted. I have to admit not being a fan of the Director, Tim Bekmambetov. Somewhat disappointed in his Russian Films Nightwatch and Daywatch. However, in his American directorial he delivers!! An abundance of profanities and over the top action sequences that are beyond xtreme fill the screen in a dizzying array of visual adrenaline. Holding you in a tight breathtaking grip with its interesting visual techniques, humor and acting. James McAvoy (the sweet faun from the Chronicles of Narnia) plays the loser we all know, Wesley Gibbon. The guy, who just trudges through life allowing himself to be walked upon, humiliated and has no desire to escape it, except in a bottle of anti-anxiety meds. Enter a beautiful Woman, Fox (Angelie Jolie), a mysterious wise man Sloan (Morgan Freeman) and his life instantly changes from Billing Reports to Gratuitous Violence, Mastering Weaponry Skills, and Assassination. Believe me when I say what the Matrix introduced, Wanted has mastered. The director is a skilled artist at using the camera in conveying visual emotions of Wesley like I have never seen before, wait I take that back, seen it in NightWatch. I definitely recommend this deliberately humorous, action packed, violent, profane, to-the-extreme film to be seen on the big screen - check this one out!!",/review/rw1920031/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2009,cosmorados,3," A bunch of effects thrown together, do not a good action film make.
","So James McAvoy plays a bored office worker whose being chased by this killer and saved by Angelina Jolie's character to be hired by a group of assassins who maintain the balance of order in the world by a magic weaving machine (I kid you not!) they can make bullets bend and have the ability to perform superhuman feats but seemingly without super-human abilities and it is all a big excuse to use yet more matrixy effects bit without the reasoning, logic or sense.",/review/rw1920031/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2009,DarthBill,1," Action trash, and not particularly good action trash at that
","PLOT (or lack there of): a jerky, mean spirited loser whom we are meant to embrace as an everyman protagonist (McAvoy) is plucked out of his unhappy, depressing life (which includes a crappy job with an annoying boss, a bitchy, unfaithful girlfriend who cheats on him - with his knowledge - with his douche bag 'best friend') by the mysterious Freeman, who reveals that McAvoy's character is the son of a highly skilled, practically superhuman assassin, for his fraternity of superhuman assassins who base their kills on mystical messages of sorts from a loom, trained (make that repeatedly beaten up) by Jolie. But there is more to it than meets the eye. Or not.",/review/rw1920031/?ref_=tt_urv

11 July 2008,Turfseer,1," Morgan and Angelina laugh all the way to the bank
","'Wanted' begins with a shootout between two professional assassins in a high-rise office building. One off the assassins jumps to the rooftop of the other building where he murders all the people who are trying to kill him. However, when he jumps, he's able to fly across horizontally without falling to the ground. He's also able to control the bullets he fires from his gun making them bend around potential victims and then striking the targets he seeks. All this comic book nonsense wouldn't be so offensive except for the fact that the director enjoys reveling in the violence throughout the film. Bullets fly in slow motion and always seems to strike their victims in the center of the head with gobs of blood oozing all over the place. ",/review/rw1920031/?ref_=tt_urv
