20 September 2007,blanbrn,7," It pushes the envelope for cable TV. Not your typical angel certainly no ""Highway to Heaven""
","Just recently over the last month I started to watch TNT's new cable drama series ""Saving Grace"", because I had read so much about it in the entertainment magazines and tabloids that it was racy and pushed the limits for cable and I agree, but it's highly enjoyable and I like it's theme and the acting is great from Holly Hunter. Holly Hunter the fine veteran actress that she is stars wonderfully as Grace a hard living, hard working, down on her luck, cigarette smoking, beer drinking, bed hopping, redneck Oklahoma City detective that does her best to solve crime and have fun while being sexy as ever. Now talk about a lot of adjectives to describe her character! Aside from the drama and characterization of her the shows theme is around an angel who appears to Grace he's named Earl played brilliant by Leon Rippy he's so caring and he often scolds Grace and he guides her in the right direction and Earl always makes Grace feel guilty about her sinful deeds. Yes the program pushes the envelope it's not ""Highway to Heaven"" the sex and loving making scenes are racy and raunchy showing plenty of skin really to much bump and grind for cable yet in today's modern age it passes. Also Holly Hunter flashes plenty of skin and she has been shown many times in scenes wearing sexy colored bras that makes it another reason to watch great sex appeal Holly is very sexy for a middle aged woman, and her characters accent has such a nice southern twang. Really one of the better new cable series another winner for TNT this is something an average person can relate to the drama of hard work and hard living with hope from an angel.",/review/rw1731515/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2007,sfbearcop,8," TNT has a winner, here
","It's obvious Ms. Hunter wanted to do this role. She's listed as one of the producers, so she either moved things forward or she's saving the production some money by taking some of her salary as back-end. I can certainly understand her desire to play Grace. Few women these days get to play tough, problem ridden cops who are struggling for some form of redemption. I guess if no one wants to write material like this for the big screen, we'll be seeing more high-value actresses on the small screen. Ms. Hunter follows Kyra Sedgwick in her series, and Glenn Close in her role on the Shield and in her new series.",/review/rw1731515/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was a great show with wonderful actors, mainly good story lines and smart dialogs. It has a lot of cool lines especially for main actress Holly Hunter, who is really adorable as the center of all things in the show. After some time a solo that big would become a bit dull, but luckily there are a lot of great supporting actors, first of all Leon Rippy, who gives some Kind of Oklahoma-Style Angel, a really nice invention with all his southern accent and cowboy behavior.",/review/rw1731515/?ref_=tt_urv

17 September 2007,elizabuff72,10," An excellent, original show - a wild ride!
","What a cast! Holly Hunter, Leon Rippy, Laura San Giacomo, Lorraine Roussaint, etc.! Each show gets successively better as the writing gets tighter. No dumbing down here which is much appreciated. I hope this show goes on forever - seriously! Every episode is a an enexpected treat. You may not want to face some of the rougher issues the show raises about life, conscience, fear, God, and human nature. It's made me think about may past incidents in my personal life and how I chose to deal with them or chose not to. The writing is snappy and funny at times and at other times very touching. The chemistry between the cast members is palpable and every single character is original and interesting. What a true joy to know as a viewer I'm being asked to think and consider what I'm watching and make up my own mind rather than be spoon fed someone else's definition of good and evil. This is the only show I make sure I never miss!",/review/rw1731515/?ref_=tt_urv

24 October 2008,michealhise,9," Smart, funny, feeling and real
","There's been a lot of talk that this show is vulgar, that Holly Hunter's character is repulsive and doesn't deserve saving. Through her constant struggles to find herself and her peace of mind after the tragic death of her sister from the OK bombings, her abuse from childhood, and a job that makes her question the common decency of human beings, Grace is portrayed in a way I think most people can relate to.",/review/rw1731515/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2007,mirwais-orbit,8," Amazing
","I think that Saving Grace is a part of that current successful plot (bad ass woman working to put everything in order) chosen by TNT to be massive produced and follow the success of The Closer. That's so that way that the creator and the main writer is the same for both series: Nancy Miller. But that's OK, the show stills being a little original, and that's what matters to me.",/review/rw1731515/?ref_=tt_urv

2 December 2013,A_Different_Drummer,9," Answers of Hollywood's Oldest Riddles...
","Excellent show. Great concept which DID NOT GET IN THE WAY of the weekly episodes, great supporting cast (how can you go wrong with Laura San Giacomo?) and clever character development. ""Grace"" is one of the most loving characters ever penned in a TV script. Literally. She loves her best friend. She loves her dog. She loves her grandfather. She loves her job. She pretty much loves Life. Yet, she is a successful homicide detective who paradoxically needs a ""Last Chance Angel."" That is clever writing folks, and Hunter sells the character like a Boxing Day special. But to this reviewer this show is really about one of the oldest controversies in Hollywood, namely, what happens if you take a A-List star and allow that star to do his or her thing in a TV series..? Even though the lines between TV and film have blurred in the last few years, the debate is real. Holly Hunter is a perfect example. She will, I think, always be remembered for her film work. She is one of those actresses who you cannot easily substitute (in a mental casting call) with anyone else. She is unique. And yet here she is doing a weekly series...? How did that turn out??? She was brilliant!! If you check the IMDb you will see about a dozen nominations for best actress on SAVING GRACE, and all deserved. (Not many wins -- one wonders if the voters were themselves influenced by the fact that she was ""slumming"" for this project?) In my view, Hunter is the show and hanging out with her character is what gives the show traction. Top rated.",/review/rw1731515/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2008,dad22js,10," Not really a spoiler, just advising viewers to go the distance.
","Like some of the others who have posted here, I was at first uncomfortable with the Miss Hunter's character being so openly slutty. I want Hollywood to be more responsible when portraying sexual activity so that the public would be more aware of the dangers of STDs and other drawbacks to morally bad behavior. Not like I set a good example in my youth, but these days you can suffer for life and even die from one ill advised encounter. Having watched the series through it's first 13 episodes I now feel that the character of Detective Hanadarko was portrayed correctly and with great artistic feeling. My advise is to watch the show through all episodes (so far) and you will understand where the story is going. In feature films I am often impatient with the story line, waiting to find out where we are being taken. It doesn't always pay off, but this show does. Excellent writing, casting, directing and acting make this one terrific show. Hang in there, then make your mind up.",/review/rw1731515/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2013,dashopaholic,10," Fabulous testimony
","Having LOVED Touched by An Angel and Joan of Arcadia, I wasn't sure how I would like this one. Grace is a hard drinking, swearing, promiscuous woman. But she is also a woman who is an outstanding police detective with a very strong sense of right and wrong. She really does have principals! It truly was an outstanding series. It reminds us all that G-d loves you no matter what you have done; are going to do; and He forgives us for our very human shortcomings. It is also a timely reminder that G-d uses real men and women to do His work. The apostles were NOT saints! They were flesh and blood men who like all men had their flaws. Yet G-d used them to spread the Gospel of Christ and to found the Christian church. It's a comfort really to know we too can serve G-d and survive this earthly plain intact even with our flaws. I do find it really weird though that Joan of Arcadia was canceled after 2 seasons...just when she was actually going to start confronting evil in season 3. The top dogs of Saving Grace did the same thing to this show. I have no doubt, if they had been given time, we would have seen some phenomenal story lines the next season. I am grateful, however, that the powers that be did allow them 3 additional episodes to tie up this series. Every actor chosen for this series was outstanding! I hope we will see many of them in the future in other series.",/review/rw1731515/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2014,bjarias,7," .. it was good, but not a huge loss to see it end
","The series did not end after just three seasons through the fault of the actors. They did their part (and look as if they had a darn good time while doing it). But a story about the life of a hard living, heavy drinking, promiscuous, 50 year-old female detective (with an angel buddy) was just not ever going to capture a large TV audience, and the continuously falling ratings reflected that fact. The show in all probability would have benefited from fewer recurring characters.. and spending more time with those remaining. As for Holly Hunter.. bit.ly/16lc7ck .. her acting was consistently solid, but her diminutive physical stature, and the fact that a couple of hunks would be chasing her about as if she were Kate Upton, did not lend credibility to the storyline.. she did most times make it fun to watch though (can do a wasted boozer better than most anybody). Some of the episodes don't come off well, but when all things line up.. they are absolutely something special to watch. The third season was the weakest of the three, with several oddball episodes that ended the series, and coming at the wrong time to assure the shows fourth season... (and once it was over for Connie... well, that was a premonition of what was to come).",/review/rw1731515/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2008,j3inpenn,10," Great Show
","I like this show. It is very well done. What makes it what it is are the scenes between Holly Hunter and Leon Rippy. I like watching them interact with one another because so much real emotion comes out of it. The rest of the cast is great too. It is well written and well directed. I hope that it has a long run on TNT and I hope that the acting, writing and directing stay original. Grace is such an interesting character to watch. She has the viewer rooting for her at some points in the storyline and at other times she has them feeling bad for her. It is hard to decide whether you like her or hate her. It will be interesting to see where it all goes.",/review/rw1731515/?ref_=tt_urv

9 March 2010,gypsycyn666,10," Introspection at its best
","I am thankful that a show can be so thought provoking. There are many times I find it easy to identify with Grace and her daily struggles to do the right thing while giving into her weaknesses. She is strong and imperfect. Such is life and the world we exist in. Whether the viewer is religious or not, Grace touches on the harsh realities on the road to redemption. Deep, complex, sometimes a little scattered but always pushing us to think about the what ifs of what lies beyond life and what the consequences are for our actions. Grace represents a side of law enforcement that we commonly see portrayed by men and, as a result, some may find her actions to be unrealistic. I think she does an excellent job portraying the difficulties faced when trying to have a sane personal life while dealing with the worst in humanity.",/review/rw1731515/?ref_=tt_urv

","An improbable but still likable show about a wounded woman and her last chance angel. Grace, whose heart is loving but can't accept love herself, struggles with her life direction while making hard choices. The supporting characters humanize Grace while allowing her to evolve. They allow us to see sides of Grace that prevent her from being a stereotype. The antics of the OCPD bring much needed humor to the show, although they haven't aged well for today's culture. The first two and a half seasons earn the 8 star rating.",/review/rw1731515/?ref_=tt_urv
