",It's about time! I've been tired of the usual romantic comedies -- guy in high-school/college/work falls in love with beautiful girl -- the courting.. the romanticism (i mean physical stuff! a lot of it!).. breakup.. rejoining.. happy ever after.,/review/rw1752578/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2006,claudio_carvalho,8," Delightful and Sweet First Love
","In Manhattan, the 10 ¾ years old Gabe (Josh Hutcherson) finds his first love when he meets his former kindergarten mate, the eleven years old Rosemary (Charlie Ray), in his karate classes. Confused with his new feelings and with the divorce process of his beloved parents, Leslie (Cynthia Nixon) and Adam (Bradley Whitford), he experiences the delightful unknown sensation of being in love for the first time.",/review/rw1752578/?ref_=tt_urv

","I watched this film on recommendation from a good friend whose opinion I trust, and let me tell you I was not disappointed. I think I would pity anyone who watches this film, and cannot find a way to relate to its subject matter. Most of the humor (and one of the things that make this movie so good) is that t is based on the assumption that the viewer relates to the events on screen. I can remember times in my life where I had the same feelings as Gabe and the same fears about acting on them.",/review/rw1752578/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2006,spooly_montana,9," Love story for all ages
","I want to shine the spotlight on a nice, little movie that might slip under your radar, and it shouldn't. LITTLE MANHATTAN is about a young boy in NYC, named Gabe, and his first crush on a girl, ever. Quite an awkward transition, considering girls have cooties, and are gross horrible creatures to a boy of ten. Our hero though is growing up. Presently Gabe is 10 ¾ years old and the girl of his affection, is 11 year old Rosemary, who is quite a match in the karate class they both attend. Quite suddenly this strange change occurs and there Rosemary is. The same girl he had grown up with in school, and went to kindergarten with, but now it is different. He actually notices her. Where did this nervousness come from that springs up every time he is in her presence? What does it mean? It does not help matters any that his parent's are in the middle of a prolonged divorce, where they have to cohabitate the same apartment until the paperwork goes through. Oh, the insecurity! This thing called ""love"" is sure accompanied by a fair share of highs and lows. We were all there (or will be), what an age. I certainly am glad that you only have to go through that part of growing up, only once. The film captures the age & subject matter perfectly. All the questions, inner dialogue, and those puzzling things we notice about the opposite sex (and continue to notice as we grow up, I might add). That treacherous area we tread between youth and adolescence, fraught with a childlike confusion at this new territory. The two young actors playing Gabe and Rosemary hit the right chords. The filmmakers capture their viewpoint wonderfully, splashing it onto the screen. It is a great joy to watch this awkward stage played out so well, on film, in this love story for all ages. Don't let this one slip away. Rated PG.",/review/rw1752578/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2006,TxMike,," A movie about a boy's first love, but not really a kids movie.
","My wife and I found this to be a totally interesting and entertaining little movie. It is about a 2 week period in June, just after school lets out, and the central character is Gabe (Josh Hutcherson). His parents are planning a divorce and Josh, only being just short of 11, is allowed to roam a 9 square block area near home, just west of Central Park, his 'Little Manhattan.'

30 June 2006,mysta02,8," Two kids find love unlooked for and must work through their feelings
","This is a great movie. I was laughing through the whole thing, not because it's a comedy, per se, but rather because I can relate to Gabe on so many levels. What I mean is, this film will resonate with any of you guys out there who've ever felt uneasy getting close to a girl, and with any girls who've ever known a guy to be that way. This is a real family film that is actually appropriate enough to be viewed by the whole family, and those can be hard to find these days. All of the actors did a great job, especially Josh Hutcherson (Gabe) and Charlie Ray (Rosemary). They did an amazing job. The story is interesting the whole way through - very entertaining, and I recommend this movie to you.",/review/rw1752578/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2005,LAKERS34,8," Sweet and Well Done - Definitely a XMAS Sleeper
","It's simple, it's cute, it's unpretentious, and it's pretty much blood-free. It tells a sweet story about innocence and romance which is applicable to all of us despite using 11 year-old kids (Josh Hutcherson, a ""veteran"" and Charlie Rose, a newcomer) as its main players...This film will remind many of you of ""The Wonder Years"", which of course isn't a bad thing (Wouldn't you say that was GREAT television??). There is a nice parallel in the story in that while the main character is falling in love, his own parents are falling out of it and headed for the splits.",/review/rw1752578/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2006,writers_reign,7," Puppy Love But Not A Dog
","American child actors are notorious for being sophisticated beyond their years, irritating, cynical, nauseating etc so it's a refreshing change to find a movie in which this is not the case. It's true that the writing, especially in the voice-over narration is on a level above the average eleven year-olds but that, of course, is its appeal to an adult audience. There's a lot that's right and not so much that's wrong with this movie starting with the writing through to the direction and certainly the performances. It's not going to make anyone's Ten or Even One Hundred Best list but it is a perfect summer movie, charming, funny, enjoyable. Trust me, I'm a cynic.",/review/rw1752578/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2005,ronwraw,10," Cutest movie I've ever seen!
","This is one of the cutest movies I've ever seen in my life! The movie is light-hearted and incredibly sweet. It tells the story of an adorable 10-year-old boy named Gabe whose parents are divorcing, but under New York law they must remain living together until the divorce is final. (This creates a small problem, as you can probably imagine.) Gabe becomes infatuated with Rosemary, a girl in his karate class he knew as a kindergärtner. They begin to practice karate together and Gabe's like for her blooms into love. I won't spoil anything but Josh Hutcherson is SO sweet narrating the movie, which melted my heart. Charlie Ray is one of the prettiest little girls I've ever seen! It's one of my all-time favorites and a great movie to see as a family. Let me tell you now that the presence of New York City (of which I was born and raised) is the backbone of the movie, having many beautiful scenes along the river and in Central Park. That's almost as good as Gabe's imaginations of karate gurus- you'll have to see it to know what I mean!",/review/rw1752578/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2007,Isaac5855,7," An Offbeat and Endearing Romantic Comedy...
","LITTLE MANHATTAN is a surprisingly clever and adult romantic comedy, with a clever screenplay in the tradition of some of Woody Allen's best work, except that the protagonists are children. Josh Hutcherson plays Gabe, a 10-year old New Yorker who falls head over heels in love with Rosemary (Charlie Ray), an 11-year old girl in his karate class. The romantic ups and downs between these two are delightfully chronicled here, thanks to a winning screenplay accentuated by Gabe's off-screen narration, which ranks with some of Woody Allen's best narrations. Huctherson and Ray are completely convincing in their roles and you can't help but cheer for them throughout. Cynthia Nixon and Bradley Whitford co-star as Gabe's parents, who are separated, but still residing in the same apartment. A winning adult romantic comedy with children as the leads. Give this one a look, it might surprise you.",/review/rw1752578/?ref_=tt_urv

31 May 2007,cosmic_quest,8," Adorable film about a boy's first crush
","Forget cheap adolescent soaps and tacky Disney flicks, 'Little Manhattan' has to be one of the most realistic and touching portrayals of young love. The film centres on ten-year-old Gabe, a New York boy whose life revolves around friends, sport and playing referee to his estranged parents. That is, until, he starts karate class with schoolmate Rosemary. Gabe has known Rosemary since kindergarten but this is the first time he starts to see girls as creatures to be admired and he find himself launched into his first crush. Suddenly, he is nervous talking to her and cares about his appearance, leaving the poor boy wondering just what love is doing to him...",/review/rw1752578/?ref_=tt_urv

18 October 2006,arieliondotcom,10," Little Manhattan is a Big Heartful
","Wonderful just about sums it all up. From the very clever writing and narrative voice reminiscent of Charlie Brown and Linus in the old Charlie Brown specials giving adult insights to the lives of 10-year-olds to great acting from everyone. Even the soundtrack is a hit. And the best part of all is that it is a family film you can watch with your children and talk to them about (anyone from 7 to 15 I'd say). Oh they may squirm around at parts and may tease about it. Don't be too pointed in trying to relate anything on screen to their lives or yours. But there are some big life lessons in Little Manhattan and this is a wonderful way to share them with your children or relive them yourself. As a native New Yorker I was especially taken with the genuine New York setting and sensibilities. See it. Especially with your children. It will resonate with all of you though you may not be able to talk about it at the time or in words for a while. And it will open doors of communication to say what should be said when it is painful, but wonderful, to say it. And that's what it's all about.",/review/rw1752578/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2008,GOWBTW,9," Reminds me of myself, only I was younger!
","Love in New Yok brings back memories of my first love. Only I was 7 years-old. A young man named Gabe(Josh Huterson) meets his friend in karate class named Rosemary(Charlie Ray). They once knew each other in kindergarten, now hey go to karate class together. Those two were an item, just like me when I was in 2nd Grade. The karate teacher knew they like each other, only Gabe wasn't man-enough to show it. For Gabe it's hard because his parents are divorced, and it's his first time on knowing love. Most boys think it's gross when a girl kisses him. I would say, ""WHIMPS!"" I never got grossed out when my girlfriend kissed me. When Rosemary was getting a new sparring partner, Gabe thinks they were the new item. However, he was a jerk realizing that she didn't like him. He cries and cries when he hurt her. I was man enough to admit being a jerk when I called her a name I regretted. Took me two days to say I was sorry. Then she was going to a private school, and he learns that out of all the girls, she was the one he ever loved. Love is strange, it hurts, and it heals, this movie is perfect for me. Simply because it brought back memories. 4 out of 5 stars!",/review/rw1752578/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2008,rodrmar70,8," Flashbacks of your own feelings
","I have seen this movie twice, probably the third romantic movie that compelled me to do that, and the reasons are quite simple: It's probably impossible that anyone can't relate to young Josh Hutcherson character, a 11 year's old with a normal middle class life and problems (parents initiating divorce); that it's surprise by the re discovery of a young classmate (Charly Ray's character) initially as an unexpected friend an later as something else...",/review/rw1752578/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2009,CitizenCaine,8," A Very Charming Sleeper
","Little Manhattan is the story of first love of a pair of charming fifth graders. The actors playing the two leads, Josh Hutcherson and Charlie Ray, are utterly fascinating and brilliant to watch. Charlie Ray, the girl, in fact made her film debut with this wonderful ode to first love. Mark Levin directed the film written by Jennifer Flackett, and it hearkens back to the days of Kevin Arnold and Winnie Cooper from The Wonder Years. Levin wrote several episodes of the series and uses the same voice over technique of the young male actor narrating events as they happen. The end result is an honest and real look at subject matter that has rarely been this poignant and ingratiating. Melody, a British film from 1971, comes to mind. The film contains wonderful location footage in and around Manhattan and a hilarious homage to The Graduate. Additional subtle odes to Play It Again Sam, A Little Romance, and The Karate Kid are apparent as well. Flackett's screenplay is never clichéd, cloying or maudlin and is the biggest reason why the film succeeds. The performances are honest, real, and true to life. It's an excellent, entertaining film to watch with youngsters similar in age to the young leads. *** of 4 stars.",/review/rw1752578/?ref_=tt_urv

22 December 2007,miketigas25,10," Makes you want to fall in love all over again.
","I just watched this movie on TV a couple of hours ago and I just loved it! It's a really cute movie. Every scene and every word Gabe utters is just so reminiscent of my past; most especially the scene where they were talking on the phone and Gabe starts yelling, ""I hate you!"" Haha! I remembered doing that exact same thing on the phone! And the funny thing was that the reason I did that was the same reason why Gabe did that! The only problem I had with this movie is that it didn't have a happy ending. (Well, depends on how you define a Movie Happy Ending, actually.) Still, the opening scenes of the movie made it seem like a sad ending was inevitable.",/review/rw1752578/?ref_=tt_urv

31 August 2020,blott2319-1,8," Sweet and magical rom-com as good as one starring adults
","There are a lot of times that I find voiceover annoying or lazy, but with Little Manhattan I found it to be a useful and integral part of telling the story. It actually gave this movie a ""Wonder Years"" feeling which is not a bad thing at all, and the story kind of fit with something I would see on that old show. In my opinion, Little Manhattan might be the single best portrayal of young love I have ever seen captured on film. Screenwriter Jennifer Flackett, and director Mark Levin clearly understand how the mind of a young boy works (particularly how confusing it is when distaste for girls turns into a crush.) Josh Hutcherson was a cute kid, and did a good job with this film, with the possible exception of his attempt to simulate crying. However, I was more impressed with the performance of Charlotte Ray Rosenberg. The vital thing in her role was to keep the audience guessing, because we're never really sure how she feels about the bond she's forming with this boy. Since the entire film is told from his perspective she needs to be an enigma, and she is able to portray both kindness and a slight indecisiveness as though she doesn't know how to respond. It genuinely kept me on my toes with the main character wondering if he had found true love or not.",/review/rw1752578/?ref_=tt_urv
