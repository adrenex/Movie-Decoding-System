22 September 2021,Tweekums,7," A decent enough British remake of a better Belgian series
","This series is centred on Professor Jasper Tempest; a criminology lecturer at Cambridge. After a request from police officer, and former student Lisa Donkers, he starts helping the local constabulary with their investigations. He isn't easy to work with; he is obsessed with cleanliness and will say exactly what he thinks which makes him seem rude and insensitive.",/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2021,Sleepin_Dragon,8," A very watchable series.
","To start off, I have not seen the original series, so my views are not influenced by the fact that this is a remake.",/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv

",This is a fairly straight remake of the much-liked Belgian show from 2015 which ran to three series and can be found on ALL4.,/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2021,rich-mac,8," Crime and humour - what could possibly go wrong
",Professor T is refreshingly good fun - the emphasis is on its quirky character development and detailing which is enhanced with glimpses into the main character's inner surreal world.,/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2021,pereiradorogerio,9," An excellent crime series with a surrealistic comedy side.
","I didn't see the Belgium original series and I'm glad for that, now I can enjoy the British take on it, without spoilers. It's a perfect cast, I love their acting and how they interpret the characters. The filming is superb and has a fantastic scene composition. Also has a good soundtrack, attention to set details and overall design. It gets better with each new episode, don't be discouraged by the simple crime plot of the first episode, keep watching and you will be rewarded. I can't wait for season 2. For me it's a solid 9, I think talent like this,both on filming and acting, must be recognized.",/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,systersister,7," Good enough.
","In Murder in Paradise Ben Miller was this quirky policeman with a big brain and no social finesse. Great show. In Professor T he repeat that performance. But now as an eccentric crime academic. With no social finesse and strange behavior. It works this time also. But I miss him in Murder. Better role. Emma Naomi is also really good. Well, I have seen the original Belgian Professor T. Its not better than the British cover but is a bit warmer. Hope for a new season.",/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv

",Ben Miller is wonderfully bonkers and plays it just right. Highly entertaining. Recommended.,/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2021,vacio-43323,6," Interesting, but, it doesn't stand out.
","I love Ben Miller as an actor, in the series ""death in paradise"", he is splendid, but, compared to the Belgian version, in which a Koen De Bouw absolutely shines, you really think he has that disorder, the second you see him in scene, you know that something is not going well, he knows perfectly how to move between reality and madness, he is also supported by enormous secondary actors such as the actress Goele Derick who plays his secretary, the actor Carry Goossens his college colleague or the actor Herwig Ilegems who acts as a police officer.",/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2021,xmasdaybaby1966,10," Tempestuously good.
","Why do people watch one episode of a show and then give it a poor rating on the show's main page? Surely, they should put the review on the episode they saw so that the marks for the series reflect the views of those that have watched the whole series?",/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2021,jerry6-1,8," sofar only watched 3 eps
","Ben Miller is perfect for this part , the cast is very good they play well off each other . Scenery and photography are great . Hoe this continues for a few more seasons . So few shows worth watching these days.",/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2021,Design88,5," Sadly...no comparison...
","I'm another reviewer who has been spoiled by the original Belgian series which is unique, quirky, compassionate, bright and fiery!! In comparison, the UK version is dull, poorly cast and rather boring.",/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,kindofblue-78221,9," Old fashioned TV that's very satisfying.

21 July 2021,OperaTarte,6," Dr. T-ERRIBLE
","""Unfortunately"" I watched the original version from Belgium. None of this - for me - comes close to the quirkiness & originality of the first. It might help if the peripheral characters/actors were cast on par - they are not. One of the weakest supporting cast I've seen. There is absolutely no charisma - no balance amongst any. The 'romance' doesn't deserve attention - tossed in there to give the backstory some personality. The two momentary lovers are poles apart in conveying any attraction, individually or as a pair. I'm mildly surprised at this British series being to lacklustre - then again lately very few have even tried to even try.",/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,thorntonburns,3," The original show was the best.
",Why redo a classic with a plastic imitation. This British version is almost impossible to watch. The Belgium series had 39 impressive episodes this Brit version can't deliver on 6 episodes. Just put the original one on and forget about this unbaked cake.,/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2021,pixelwks,2," Hamfisted Remake Of A Great Series
",What a dumb idea to remake this series. Is this to get people who won't read subtitles?,/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2021,Chazzbat,8," Not as good as the original
","I loved the original Belgian series (which ended too soon, IMO), so I was curious to see how it would transpose into English. I'm delighted that they have stuck close to the source material, retaining the quirkiness and eccentricities of the main character.",/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2021,larmo,5," A pale version of the original series.
","I think the Ben Miller in the title role, is the best thing that this watered down version of the original Belgian TV series has to offer. In this version, the emphasis is on the professor's OCD. The episodes are almost direct copies of some of the original series episodes. There are other episodes which are kind of a mix of some of the original Belgian series episodes. I watched the entire first season, and then started to binge the original Belgian series. I have come to appreciate the original series so much more than this pale version of it. Based on other American viewers' reviews. I imagine that many people would prefer this light and mild version. The role of the young female detective is a shadow of the original character. The British actress really isn't given a lot of acting range in portraying the character. I may watch the second season of this series when it is released, but I know that I will only be mildly entertained.",/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2021,sv-52905,8," Second only to the original
","I have seen all 3 series, Belgian, German and this from England. The original Belgian is my favorite and this a close second. It retains the fanciful mostly comical hallucinations that were missing in the German series. And the quirky departmental secretary is an absolute hoot in both Belgian and English series. Ben Miller's portrayal of the professor is slightly warmer than the original, which makes the character very appealing.",/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2021,PaxD75,1," After 1 ep: contrived, magical insights, bad script
",I plan to watch a few more episodes (and adjust my rating accordingly) but the plot for the first one was just awful. In a nutshell... the clueless cops call in fastidious professor. They have got nothing to go on.,/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2021,Ralindon0,2," Worn out ideas
","The OCD protagonist and the domineering mother themes are so worn out one has to wonder why anyone would write yet another series that combines the two. The mysteries are interesting but the style of the show, with its predictable side plots and outcomes, is simply boring. The OCD angle, along with the hallucinations, are distractions. I don't know if the Belgian version was any better, but if it was worse one has to wonder why this new creative team thought they could improve on it.",/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2021,squintykids,6," Remake......lost in translation?
",Fortunately (or unfortunately) I watched the original Belgian series which I thought was brilliant.,/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2021,davewaldo-114-471767,2," Please watch the original, this is terrible in comparison.
","As a stand alone drama, for those who've not seen the real one, this maybe bearable but for anyone who's had the delight of seeing the Belgian original, this is a very poor copy. I like Ben Miller but the unbelievably brilliant Koen De Bouw, in fact all the actors in the original were so much better than any of the cast in this. I just watched the 5th episode (my last). I shall watch the original again rather than endure this tripe.",/review/rw7316323/?ref_=tt_urv
