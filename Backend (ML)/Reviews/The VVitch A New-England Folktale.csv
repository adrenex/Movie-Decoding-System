25 May 2009,TheLittleSongbird,7," A little silly at times, but a colourful and amusing film.
","This film is nowhere near as bad as the rating suggests, sure it isn't flawless, but a good film doesn't need to be that to be enjoyable. I thought Scooby Doo a colourful film, with some good direction, and very good performances from all involved. The best of the cast were Matthew Lilliard as Shaggy and Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne, and Rowan Atkinson is amusing as Mondavarious. The film is very amusing at times, especially the scene when Scooby dresses as a Grandma and the scenes in the haunted house. The actress of Mary-Jane is very sweet too. But I will say that the film isn't without its flaws. The plot is a little far-fetched, and some of the farting jokes are very silly. There have been complaints of the Scooby Doo model being charmless, but I disagree. He was quite sweet at times. The only character I didn't really like that much was Scrappy, then again I never did like him, not even in the animated series. Despite these flaws, this film is not bad at all, and I will award a 7/10. Bethany Cox",/review/rw2476750/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2018,WeAreLive,9," Great movie
","I remember watching this movie when I was about 7 and I really loved it. 
This movie is defiantly a good joy ride for new and old Scooby Doo fans.
I haven't seen this movie for ages so bare with me if I can't remember everything.
The best parts where when the creatures attacked the house, the flashback with scrappy, when a guy was about to sacrifice a chicken and the last scene. 
Overall it's an adventurous movie and I would recomand it.",/review/rw2476750/?ref_=tt_urv

30 March 2020,Calicodreamin,7," Good scooby-doo fun
","Is this an Oscar worthy movie? No. But it's all in good fun, a proper scooby-doo mystery with a few good laughs. The actors are so well cast to play the mystery inc. gang that it makes this movie so much fun. I enjoy watching this from time to time, it a mindless comedy.",/review/rw2476750/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2010,leplatypus,10," As good as a pack of Scooby snacks ! (DVD)
","Scooby was my favorite show when i was a child (along with ""Goldorak"") and I rediscovered it as an adult when i was working in Bruxelles and when i went to the Warner Park in Madrid. That's why i went to see this movie at screen at its release and that I have a good time watching it again on DVD.",/review/rw2476750/?ref_=tt_urv

14 June 2002,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," This was such a cute movie!
","I just saw this in the theaters, and I have to say that the critics were wrong. This was so cheesy. And funny. Just a lot of fun to watch with your friends. It's also a good family movie. They did the ending just right. So, to the ""sophisticated"" critics out there, maybe you need to keep your mouths shut and learn that it's the viewer's opinions that count!",/review/rw2476750/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2003,L_Forster,," I thought it was funny.
","This might be a disappointment to die hard Scooby Doo cartoon fans, but I enjoyed it.  I thought the gags were hilarious, and since I never cared for Scrappy Doo, I was especially fond of the end.  I think Matthew Lillard should get an academy award for the way he interacted to a character that wasn't even there.  In my mind, every time I see a Scooby Doo cartoon, I will picture him as Shaggy.  It also brought the characters even more alive for me when the ""human"" sides of their personalities came out.  It's really reaching to think that a group of people would be able to spend that much time together and not have individual jealousies and get on each other's nerves.  I can't wait to see the sequel.",/review/rw2476750/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,planktonrules,7," It works because the filmmakers chose the wisest course for the film
","Years ago, I watched and loved both ""The Brady Bunch Movie"" and ""A Very Brady Sequel"". Why? Because instead of just trying to recreate the original characters, the filmmakers made a very funny film that poked fun at the characters and plots of the original show. Had they simply made a movie with Brady characters it would have been pretty dull.",/review/rw2476750/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2002,nucksfan4life,6," Scooby's a hit on the big-screen
","This movie works because it tries to mimic the cartoon in many ways. Even the first shot looks like the first shot of the cartoon with the fog and the creepy old house. I had originally thought that the CGI Scooby would bother me during the movie, but I was completely wrong. I only really thought about that the first time Scooby is shown. After that the dog was Scooby to me because the things he says and the way he says them are accurate to the cartoon. The movie is pure cheese, but so was the cartoon. ""Scooby-Doo"" has maybe the most effective farting scene since ""Blazing Saddles."" Most fart scenes just come off as gross and not very funny, but in the world of Scooby a fart scene works. One interesting aspect of the film was seeing Rowan Atkinson in a role where he actually talks...a lot! I hope he gets more chances at dialogue-heavy roles here in the States.  Fred, Daphne, Velma and Shaggy all feel like their cartoon counterparts adding to the effectiveness of the movie. Lillard is amazing as Shaggy because he gets his voice to sound like a carbon-copy of the cartoon Shaggy. This is a fun movie to watch because you can turn your brain off and just enjoy the show.",/review/rw2476750/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2018,edo-sofic,6," Hidden stoner movie gem
","It's been 16 years since this movie came out, and I decided to watch it after browsing the Netflix library while being high. I was looking for the dumbest possible movie to watch, and thought Scooby Doo should do. ",/review/rw2476750/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2003,thumper_svx,," Try as I might I just can't hate it!
","When I first heard about Scooby Doo being turned into a movie, I will confess to being rather reticent about seeing it. I am just old enough to remember the original Scooby Doo cartoons on rerun, and was at the high end of the right target age group when Scrappy Doo hit the scene, and of course remembered Scooby Doo with a certain love. Of course, the cartoon was actually pretty terrible; the writing was bad, the cliches came in at a rate of knots, and the animation was second rate... but that's what we all expected of Hanna-Barbara cartoons.",/review/rw2476750/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2019,tabuno,8," Funny Children's Movie
","16 June 2002. What eight years time can do. The dialogue and performances were not as entertaining nor as magical, in some places it was downright embarrassing and lame. While the basic storyline line and the predictable moral underpinning remained decent enough, the movie didn't really hold up well consistently. The sparkle just seemed to dull over time. Perhaps the nature of the animation industry has matured and grown up further or the audience requires more than just Saturday morning mind-numbing animated/live action adventure, or this reviewer has just grown or lost childlike innocence or Sarah Michelle Geller's Buffy persona has faded with time effectively allowing the more objective experience to wash over the screen. Regardless, animated movies, and live-action have progressed significantly in the past eight years. The bar is much higher. And this movie apparently hasn't held up well in the meantime.",/review/rw2476750/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2002,dcook-4,10," Ok, color me 5-years-old
","I adore Scooby and I adored this movie...what can I say? I'm 25-years-old and yet I'm so taken by the concept of Scooby Doo. I mean, I've been ready for this movie for a long time. Sarah Michelle Gellar was excellent as Daphne...it was so strange seeing SMG as someone nearly defenseless. While Freddie Prinze Jr. is just in no way Fred, Linda Cardellini was a great Velma. They really proved the characters old-school style, keeping them as close to the old cartoon as possible. Which brings me to Matthew Lilliard. Could they have picked a better Shaggy? It's like the role was completely made for him! I give the movie 10 Scooby Snacks",/review/rw2476750/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2020,masonsaul,8," Great fun
","Whilst Scooby-Doo is probably not a good movie and not without it's flaws, mainly it's weak plot and subpar CG, it's still great fun with a unique charm. Matthew Lilllard, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Linda Cardellini and Freddy Prinze Jr. are all surprisingly perfect as their iconic characters. It's consistently really funny and extremely well paced. Raja Gosnell's direction is good, it's well filmed and the soundtrack is really good.",/review/rw2476750/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2020,themostswagjacobg,10," A Work of Genius
","This film is one of the greatest pieces of cinematic greatness I have ever seen. This was, without a doubt, one of the most blessed and sacred engagements of my senses in my life; rivaling only, perhaps, my baptism. Indeed, we speak of many of the great films and how we walk away from them with our perspectives changed and weltanschauung altered. With this movie was a rebirth of mine, especially my sense of humor, so profound, that it may be classified as a genesis. In an adjective, this movie is pulchritudinous. Its entirety is luminescent, its plot is unparagoned, and even its ""idiosyncrasies"" contribute to its divine nimbus. Nothing else is on par with its wonder.",/review/rw2476750/?ref_=tt_urv

14 September 2002,jack-frost,10," SCOOBY ROCKS !!!!
","I've always been a big fan of horror films and when I was too young to watch them, SCOOBY was my favourite cartoon because it had cool heroes and I could see all sorts of monsters in it. Even now that I'm an adult, I still find a lot of pleasure in watching an episode. Just to say that I wasn't very excited at the perspective of seeing my cult cartoon turned into an unnamable stuff as the first pictures in the magazines announced a visually ridiculous movie with probably (like most of the other TV series adaptations) a boring and incoherent script.",/review/rw2476750/?ref_=tt_urv
