8 June 2011,paul_haakonsen,8," Ready to get probed?...
","From the trailers, I had come to expect quite a lot from the movie. Actually I had thought and believed the movie to be more than it actually was when I was done watching it. Now, I am not saying that the movie is bad or dull, far from it. The movie is pretty cool and fun, though there is nothing overly new and inventive about it. And that is what sort of made the movie a bit tame.",/review/rw2754345/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2011,Aaron1375,8," Simon Peg and Nick Frost team up with an alien for a rather funny film.
","I enjoyed this film quite a bit, it is a rare comedy that started kind of slowly, but continued to get more funny as it went on. Usually I find a lot of comedies start kind of fast then fade out kind of fast. This one has two Brits who are in the United States for comic con, the end all comic book, science fiction, horror and a whole heck of a lot more conventions. These particular two are into aliens and there to not only take in the sights and meet a favorite author, but to drive to some of the famous alien spots out in the west. Well they quickly run into some trouble with some local rednecks and then end up witnessing a very bad wreck. They go out to explore the scene and end up meeting Paul, an alien who is apparently on the run and in the need of assistance. During the course of their adventure the two Brits must keep Paul hidden from government agents and also deal with crazy religious fathers and all sorts of other things one tends to find on the road. Probably why I liked this one as I always enjoy a good traveling comedy of which this can certainly be classified as one. I also enjoy watching Simon Pegg and Nick Frost working together as they have a good chemistry. They are a couple of the few actors who I will watch a movie specifically because they are in it. I used to have a whole slew of actors and actresses like that, but these days not so much. The comedy is funny, like I said it started a bit slowly as I think the comic con scenes could have been a bit funnier, but it really got going once they met up with Paul. Not much of a Seth Rogen fan, but he did a fine job as the voice of Paul. So all in all a funny comedy that kept me entertained throughout.",/review/rw2754345/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2011,KnightsofNi11,7," Sure it's not a comedic masterpiece, but its a lot of fun
","It's been a long wait, but finally, for the first time since 2007 Simon Pegg and Nick Frost team up once again as the unstoppably funny duo. Their pairing this time isn't quite at the same quality of comedy as Hot Fuzz or Shaun of the Dead but let's face it, those two movies are comedy gold. Paul is still hilarious and it is rife with highly quotable jokes that you can laugh about for days. Plus it has plenty of great nerdy sci-fi humor that only us true geeks and catch on to. Paul follows two British tourists in America, Graeme (Pegg) and Clive (Frost) who are traveling cross-country to visit all of the most famous UFO sightings in America. While in Area 51 they pick up a hitchhiking alien named Paul who is excellently voiced by Seth Rogen. Graeme and Clive quickly learn that agreeing to protect this extraterrestrial is giving them a lot more than they bargained for as they are chased by the FBI, hillbillies, and a religious shotgun toting nut job.",/review/rw2754345/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2011,Chrysanthepop,," Pegg and Frost's Sci-Fi Adventure
","Hilarious comedic duo, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are back this time in an American spoofish science-fiction adventure in Greg Mottola's 'Paul'. The sci-fi references (Alien, ET, Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind, Star Wars, Aliens, Predator, etc) are done excellently and had me laughing out loud. Pegg and Frost are superb as they always are when working together.",/review/rw2754345/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2011,Samiam3,7," Space-ious humour
","I like a movie that can make something familiar feel fresh. Paul is this years Short Circuit, or Starman, or Maybe even Galaxy Quest. Its merger of crude/rude and witty comedy plus a cast where everyone brings their A-game, without going too far makes Paul a good watch.",/review/rw2754345/?ref_=tt_urv

17 August 2011,bob the moo,," Mainstream but enjoyable sci-fi comedy
","When they were promoting Paul, I had heard Pegg and Frost discussing the film and they made a comment regarding the fact that nobody was just going to give them 50 million dollars and let them do whatever they wanted to do at risk of a loss. Also in their minds I would guess was the fact that colleague Edgar Wright had been given freedom to make Scott Pilgrim which, although really good, didn't perform box office wise. As a result of this comment I was sort of prepared for this film not quite to be as British or as smart as their previous work on things like Hot Fuzz and of course Spaced; turned out I was right to be ready for this but wrong to assume it would make a bad movie.",/review/rw2754345/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2011,TheLittleSongbird,7," Far better than expected
","Paul is not perfect, but it is not as good as Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. However I for one found it an enjoyable movie, and much better than people I know made it out to be. I mainly wanted to see it for the concept, which seemed fun and intriguing, and for the most part it was. The story is mostly fast-paced and entertaining, but there are some predictable moments with some gags going on for too long. Also while I loved Kristen Wiig in Bridesmaids, I didn't find her character here anywhere near as well written or engaging this time round. However, Paul does look great and has an appealing soundtrack. A vast majority of the writing and gags are very funny and on target and the direction is well above average as well. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are a well-matched pair, both are likable and their chemistry infectious, while Seth Rogan, an actor I don't really care for, is surprisingly good as Paul. Overall, far better than expected even with the flaws. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2754345/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2011,musanna-ahmed,8," After lampooning the cop-buddy and zombie flick genre, Pegg and Frost take their turn to meet E.T and do the same.
","Shaun of the Dead – great. Hot Fuzz – brilliant. Paul, The third collaboration between the two best friends Simon Pegg and Nick Frost is another action-packed comedy featuring an alien, guns, and Jason Bateman. Unlike the previous films the pair starred in, Paul still has the strong bromance between the two but takes a turn to be more of what Scott Pilgrim Vs the World was instead of Hot Fuzz.",/review/rw2754345/?ref_=tt_urv

17 July 2011,troy-manatunga,," It has been a while since I have been entertained on a Sci Fi comedy.
","It's been 60 years since Paul has been a visitor on planet earth. Being imprisoned in a Military facility for a long time the green guy (Paul the Alien), finds a way out. He escapes god knows how, and flees in the first vehicle he comes across. Unable to reach the pedal at the wheel Paul Swirls and finds himself in a fatal car crash, which was pretty much self-inflicted! Graeme and Clive two hardcore comic fans just happen to be taking a road trip across the states exploring area 51 in the greater Americas. Just so happens that Paul just like clockwork crashes right in front of them and so the friendship begins. Fleeing from the law is not an easy task if you're an alien I would say, not far behind in agent Zoil hot on their tail trying to bring Paul back in. Clive and Graeme make it their own concern as they earnestly try to save the little guy and send him back home. The choices they make are fairly unorthodox, but effective.",/review/rw2754345/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2011,hitchcockthelegend,8," He's not dangerous. He's kinda rude.
","Paul is directed by Greg Mottola and written by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Film sees Pegg and Frost as two British sci-fi geeks on a U.S.A. road trip to see some famous Alien landmarks. Along the way their love of all things Alien is given an unexpected boost when they gain an unusual hitchhiker: Paul, a small, foul mouthed, pot smoking Alien being. Who asks them to help him to finally get home after years of being kept prisoner by the Government. Speaking of which, the three of them best get a move on because Government law enforcers are on their tail, and was it wise to introduce a God fearing Christian into the group?",/review/rw2754345/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2011,Boba_Fett1138,7," I'm stuck somewhere between liking it and loving it.
","Actually I never really was all that interested in seeing ""Paul"", since it just looked like a bit of a lame and simplistic comedy to me, even though I of course really like other Nick Frost and Simon Pegg movies. I however kept hearing really good things about this movie so I decided to give it a chance, which was something I really don't regret.",/review/rw2754345/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a great movie.
Simon Peg and Nick Frost are talented guys, feels like we are on the journey with them.
Good writing and acting from the pair.
It's well crafted and transitions effortlessly and comfortably.
Paul of course steals the show, a great idea executed perfectly.
Loads of Sci-Fi references.
Look out for the bird scene.
Classic.

","I have to admit, that I was surprised by the language that is being used in the movie. Then I saw the rating and it kinda made sense (R-rating in America), though I didn't expect them to go that way. But while the way is what's important, it's also what might turn people a bit off the movie, especially the first 20 minutes might seem a bit slow. Something the rest of the movie will make up for!

","I was on the Irish premier of the movie last Thursday with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost showing up and saying few words before the movie . First of all, I would like to say great cast especially Sigourney Weaver , Jason Bateman and my two mini stars of the movie Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio as agents Haggard and O'Reilly . The movie its self is very funny and the script well written , the small alien with voice from Seth Rogen its very real and well made by CG artists . Obviously the chemistry between Frost and Pegg is great like always ( you know what I'm saying if you remember Shaun of the dead or Hot Fuzz )Rogen as alien is a perfect cast with his IM SMOKING WEED voice and great lines . In summary well made , great cast , funny script what else do you need for Friday night . For me seven stars",/review/rw2754345/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2011,Likes_Ninjas90,4," Pegg and Frost might have written this for an American audience but it's not what I'd call particularly funny or witty. Phone home gentlemen
","Best friends Graeme Willy (Simon Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Nick Frost) are a pair of science-fiction geeks, travelling across America in a mobile RV. They first visit the Comic-Con convention and then move through the Nevada Desert because they are interested in the supposed alien sightings. Along the way they witness a car crash on the side of the road. Investigating the vehicle, they meet Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen), a foul mouthed and obnoxious alien. While he happens to share a lot of the same eating habits as the pair, he also has special healing powers. Paul reveals he has escaped from Area 51, after being held a prisoner. He needs the boys to help take him to an extraction point so he can return home. Along the way the group is chased by some government troops, including Agent Zoil (Jason Bateman) and a father and daughter pair of Christian extremists. The girl is Ruth (Kristen Wiig) and when she ends up on the RV Graeme takes a liking to her. ",/review/rw2754345/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2011,clivy,6," Cute, but not very satirical
","My hubby and I were looking forward to seeing ""Paul"". We thought Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz were hysterical (especially for the great performance of Elvis the Swan). We enjoyed ""Paul"" but we didn't find it as funny as Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's earlier films. We thought it was a gentle comedy, about right for a Sunday afternoon.",/review/rw2754345/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2011,tavm,6," Paul is an uneven spoof of various Sci-Fi classics though it still warrants a one-time-viewing
","After a few weeks of having watched this movie, here are my comments: In attempting to spoof many various Sci-Fi classics-the works of Steven Spielberg, who cameos his voice here, in particular-there's plenty to be amused by and some moments of hilarity but the results are mainly scattershot in trying to make a cohesive whole comedy. Still, I was pretty entertained by the likes of the movie's creators in the starring roles as well as by Kristen Wiig's role as an initial religious doubter becoming more open to alien truths (at least, according to the movie's version of it). Jason Bateman also provides a role in which we don't know which side he's on until nearly the end. It's also nice to see Blythe Danner-Gwyneth Paltrow's mom-featured in another major feature. And the voice of the title character as provided by Seth Rogen provides it's own charm. There's also a surprise appearance of an actress familiar with these kinds of movies that wasn't too hard to figure out that provided some pleasures. Still, Paul is uneven in providing non-stop laughs. On that note, it's at least worth a look.",/review/rw2754345/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2013,lee_eisenberg,10," close encounter with the funny kind
","Not only is there intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, there's also wise-cracking life! Simon Pegg and Nick Frost play nerds attending Comic-Con who then meet a sarcastic alien (voiced by Seth Rogen). A lot of the movie pokes fun at Americans' stereotypes of the English, as well as stereotypes of Americans, and also every conspiracy theory. Probably the funniest scene is when Kristen Wiig's fundamentalist Christian tries to convince the guys of creationism, and then when she attempts to curse for the first time. But more than anything, ""Paul"" is a movie that really knows how to be funny. It's also clever how they have people appear in surprising places, and how they inserted a bunch of references to other movies. It's simply a movie that you're sure to like, assuming that you aren't the religious type. A real pleasure.",/review/rw2754345/?ref_=tt_urv
