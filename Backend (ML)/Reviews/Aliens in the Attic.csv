26 July 2019,intrepidami,9," Campy, Ridiculous, but just plan fun
","This is the show Whiskey Cavalier could have been. The main characters have great chemistry. The guy is a boy scout, but not too much of one. Unlike Will he's not sappy. Both characters get prolonged, well choreographed fight scenes each episode. The villains are very Raiders of The lost Ark like. The story flows and makes sense.",/review/rw4879808/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2019,fatelovesthefearless,8," Fun easy to watch entertaining show
","It has treasure hunting, nazis, terrorists and is set mostly in Europe. I'm very much enjoying this show as it's different to anything else on atm and doesn't take itself too seriously! Give it a go if you like Indiana Jones, National Treasure etc",/review/rw4879808/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,sophia55,9," Can't Wait For Season 2
","Blood and Treasure is truly a hidden gem. I've never seen a show that balances comedy and suspense so well. The twists and turns of the overarching story of season 1 are intricate and interesting, and the characters are all refreshingly nuanced. For a show that relies heavily on tropes, it was refreshing to see how many common ""action adventure"" cliches were actually subverted. Overall, Blood and Treasure doesn't take itself too seriously, and the series greatly benefits as a result.",/review/rw4879808/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2019,abalpn-99472,10," A Fast paced and action packed adventure for the 2019 summer!
",So far I've been watching this with my dad and we really like the storyline and the action. I like it when the plot could take another twist. I'm still an Indy fan and the series is just like Indiana Jones finding treasure. They film scenes in every location. I hope they can hold for another season but I still like it no matter what happens.,/review/rw4879808/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2019,monberger,8," Fun Adventure!!!
","Yeah! It is not perfect! But is different and is not the usual killers, cop kinda a show. It gets tiresome making that kind of shows all the time. Blood & Treasure is a fun adventure and the two leads have good chemistry. She is gorgeous too!!! Give it a try!",/review/rw4879808/?ref_=tt_urv

4 July 2019,linda-pines,8," Enjoyable summer series
","This is an entertaining throwback to the Indiana Jones type spoof of 40's adventure capers. The plots work for a weekly hour long show.... you can't expect it to be too serious, or even accurate historically to work as a summer escape genre. Acting is decent and believable, dialog clever on occasion..... it's fun viewing.",/review/rw4879808/?ref_=tt_urv

",Not sure where all the hate is coming from. The locations are gorgeous and Oded Fehr is one of my favorite actors. It strikes a good balance between humour and action (much like the lamented Whiskey Cavalier.,/review/rw4879808/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2019,RealityTVBites,6," Don't understand the hate
",I just finished watching the first 2 hours and i have to say i don't understand all the hate. True this is no Indiana Jones but it was moderately interesting if perhaps somewhat implausible. This IS TV not blockbuster movie stuff. People need to get over themselves and not be so hyper-critical. TV is spos'd to be entertainment so relax and let yourself be entertained.,/review/rw4879808/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2019,schubej-1,8," Entertaining
","There were plenty of improbable scenes and a lot of holes in the story. But, ignoring those issues there was plenty of action and was certainly entertaining. The dialogue was not always the best but it was a fun pilot. And the best thing was the fact that everything wasn't resolved in one episode which typically happens in other programming. I have the impression that the story won't be wrapped up until the final episode.",/review/rw4879808/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2022,jadian3,9," So Much Fun
","This is a made-for-TV adventure show which has a globe-trotting plot and interesting cast of characters. It's like Raiders meets National Treasure, meets The Librarian with a splash of Angels and Demons thrown in.",/review/rw4879808/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2019,brucebigelow-10873,8," Lighthearted fun

29 May 2019,esoukup,10," Love this show
",This show is definitely a throwback 2 adventure shows from the eighties and nineties. It has a modern take on the swashbuckling treasure-hunting films of yesterday. It is entertaining and well written. I don't understand the hate from so many other users.,/review/rw4879808/?ref_=tt_urv

27 May 2019,irishizan,7," SHE'S NO NEIL CAFFREY
","I love movies like Indiana Jones, National Treasure, Lara Croft, The Librarian, Davinci Code etc. I find the idea of a tv show that includes art, archaelogy etc appealing. But this show doesnt know what it wants to be. Too many ideas crammed together and the constant flipping back & forth to flashbacks is horrible. They've tried to show the female thief as some independant empowered woman but she comes off as arrogant with unreal physical skills. The show could learn something from ""White Collar"" where the thief was so charismatic & the ensemble cast had great chemistry.",/review/rw4879808/?ref_=tt_urv

","Really fun, high production values, treasure, bad guys, good looking leads, real historic locations, and John Larroquette! What more do you need in a summer series. Really enjoyable.",/review/rw4879808/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2019,Scot_Rutherford,7," The Adventure We Needed.
","With all the superheroes and LGBTQ material we were missing Lara Croft meets a softer, millennium version of Indiana Jones. Well nothing is perfect and Ms. Pernas steals the show so far. A great summer adventure show with a bonus of seeing John Larroquette. I'll go 8/10 as they polish.",/review/rw4879808/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2019,jimbokwright,8," Fun summer show
","This one is more ""Romancing the Stone"" than ""Raiders"" but for summer tv it's good light adventurous fun. It doesn't need to be plausible or believable. At a time where we need an entertaining break from political manipulations this show fits the bill.",/review/rw4879808/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2019,Magow-Intermean,9," 'Blood & Treasure' Review
","Few things in the TV industry are predictable anymore, but the cornerstone of the breezy summer procedural stands strong. This season of global misadventures and banter thick with sexual tension kicks off with ""Blood & Treasure,"" a new CBS drama about renegades trying to track down priceless artifacts and a notorious terrorist. Danny MacNamara (Matt Barr) is an art enthusiast who's referred to by his full name more often than not. (He's also explicitly an ""Indiana Jones"" fan, so the show isn't exactly trying to be subtle about his origins.) Lexi (Sofia Pernas) is a fugitive for hire with trust issues and a wicked left hook, who just so happens to also be Danny's ex-girlfriend. After their foe raids and blows up the tomb of Antony and Cleopatra - yes, that Antony and Cleopatra - Danny calls upon Lexi's expertise to help him get to the bottom of how and why. So as you can probably tell from that description, ""Blood & Treasure"" - from co-creators Matthew Federman and Stephen Scaia of CBS' ""Limitless"" - is about as straight up a heist series as it gets. Danny and Lexi are recognizably basic characters to anyone who's watched an action movie, with the slight gender-flipped twist of Danny being the marginal nerd and Lexi preferring to solve all her problems with blunt force. Between them, the federal agents pursuing them, and the ancient Egyptian mystery at the center, ""Blood & Treasure"" often feels like the writers threw ""The Mummy"" and ""National Treasure"" into a blender until they resembled something more network TV friendly. In fact, in a funny bit of coincidence (or is it?), the terrorist is even played by ""Mummy"" co-star Oded Fehr, who brings a welcome extra dimension to a potentially flat character. (The show also attempts to mitigate the eyebrow-raising optics of a nefarious Middle Eastern terrorist anchoring the action by making Lexi Egyptian, albeit with a posh British accent she credits to private school.) Very little about its opening two hours truly shocks; everything from the story to the dialogue is thoroughly paint by numbers. On the other hand: that kind of predictable fun is exactly what someone tuning in to a CBS procedural called ""Blood & Treasure"" probably wants. This isn't the kind of show that's trying to reinvent the wheel so much as go for a joyride that can be thrilling even if the destination is clear all along. Throw in some splashy mythology, handsomely shot setpieces on location in Rome and Morocco, and entertaining performances from Fehr, Paras, and a bumbling Michael James Shaw, and you've got yourself a solid distraction to turn to in the general desert that is TV's summer programming.",/review/rw4879808/?ref_=tt_urv

4 June 2019,starlite-78686,9," Cool show
","This show has everything i am looking for action, and fun. It has the same kind of fun when watching Raiders Of The Lost Ark and I hope it dont get canned and stay on for a sec season. This is the show to watch for, unlike the code which is boring boring boring and from what I have read from other after I watched it, it didn't do honor to the military by screwing up what they wore.",/review/rw4879808/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2019,ChrisScreenwriter,2," Excruciatingly bad
","How can a show about international art thieves and a terrorist be so bloody boring? Poor writing, jumping back and forth in time making things completely incomprehensible. Every cliche in the book thrown together in a mashmash of a story. Please, get new writers or end this show's misery.",/review/rw4879808/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2019,MiketheWhistle,8," Believe the bad reviews, but
