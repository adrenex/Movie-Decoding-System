22 July 2020,ThomDerd,9," I laughed my ars off.
","Crazy, hilarious things happen in this very funny film. Raunchy comedy remake which is funnier than the original; contemporary humor, easier to follow and with multiple Ed Helms freak out moments.
Yes, there are things in there which are hard-to-believe but who cares? This is a fictional comedy and not a documentary. Good cast, good cameos, funny jokes, odd situations and overall great entertainment; that's what you can expect from this movie.
The rating is too low here-very unfair. This is a great raunchy comedy which you might watch again and again! 9/10",/review/rw4097716/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2015,kosmasp,8," Take a break
","Most importantly: relax. Take it easy (as the song goes). But do not watch this, if you are easily offended. It really goes out there and language wise, it does not only cross the line, it catapults over it, with a vicious grin on its face. If you know you can't handle that, better save your money and time.",/review/rw4097716/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2022,brucemiddlemissphotography,9," I don't get the hate for this film
","I truly love this film, it is one of my favourite comedies of all time. 99% of the jokes work, whether it's the rancid younger brother, the ridiculous car, the Griswold Springs scene or the cringely flirtatious Chris Hemsworth.",/review/rw4097716/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2018,carlitobandito,9," Grossly Underrated
","Seriously, if everyone would just chill tfo about wanting to compare this version with the original version, you would find this movie is hilarious. First time in years I didn't want to punch Ed Helms in the face after watching him in a movie. The two actors who play the boys in the movie are great. But the gem and queen of this movie is Christina Applegate. ",/review/rw4097716/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2015,utgard14,6," Better than I expected it to be
","Reboot to the National Lampoon's Vacation series that's also a sequel of sorts. Rusty Griswold is all grown up with kids of his own and decides to take them to Walley World like his dad did with their family all those years ago. The results are just as chaotic, if never quite as funny. Remakes, reboots, etc. are always tough to make work (as they should be) but this one does surprisingly OK. It's not a patch on the first few Vacation films with Chevy Chase (who has an unfunny appearance late in this movie) but it is good in its own way. Ed Helms and Christina Applegate provide few of the laughs, which hurts more than anything since they are the leads. Most of the successful humor comes from the guest stars like Chris Hemsworth and the two kids playing the sons, Steele Stebbins and Skyler Gisondo. Stebbins is especially funny and easily the best part of the movie. To the movie's credit, it doesn't simply do a scene-for-scene remake and tries to make its own mark. But years of road trip comedies, many of which were inspired by the original Vacation, makes this feel more than a little familiar. Still, it's watchable and provides some laughs if you're in the right mood.",/review/rw4097716/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2015,ironhorse_iv,6," This Poor's man vacation was still pretty funny! Typical to every Griswold family trip, Hilarity Ensues. It's worth the trip!
","Once again, the film follows the misadventures of the Griswold family, trying to reach their vacation destination. This time, it's Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms), all grown up and with a family of his own. Idealizing past events, Rusty hopes to reconnect with his wife, Debbie (Christina Applegate), and his two kids, James (Skyler Gisondo) and Kevin (Steele Stebbins), by planning a cross country trip to Wally World. On the way, there, the group encounters several missteps that can only bring their family, closer or farer apart. Can Rusty save his marriage and bond with his children or will the chaos of the trip, be, too much for them, to handle? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found this 2015 road trip comedy directed by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein was somewhat hilarious. Serving as both a reboot and a sequel to the National Lampoon's Vacation series, I like how the movie has direct recalls to the original four films; 1983's National Lampoon's Vacation, 1985's National Lampoon's European Vacation, 1989's National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, and last, 1997's Vegas Vacation. Not only that, it has references to the 2003's TV-movie spin off, Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure & 2010's short film, Hotel Hell Vacation. I love all the similar jokes or previous film character cameos. While the movie has all those callbacks, I like how the film was also giving its own vibe. Most of the film's set pieces and locations are different, from the original film, so they're plenty of new humor, coming out of it. Unlike the 1983 version, this Rusty-led version of Vacation has more toilet humor jokes that might be a little too gross for some viewers. For me, I found the overtly raunchy scatological humor, somewhat amusing. It really hit the funny bone. Vacation is also chock full of overtly raunchy crass humor, coarse comments, sexual references, and constant strong language. Still, there were some jokes that really did bug me. Most of them, came from Kevin character. He's supposed to be a little kid, but instead comes off as a complete unwatchable sociopath. The jokes about the truck driver wanting to rape children, the whole plastic bag gag and the mean-spirited jokes from him, are frequently crosses the line into Dude, Not Funny! Territory! His character really hurts the film. Other jokes that fell flat, was cause, by the film quickly abandoning subplots: such as Rusty's brother-in-law, TV anchorman Stone Crandall (Chris Hemsworth) being an extreme conservative. While, some of his jokes were left hanging. Chris Hemsworth still have a very amusing role. I just wish, they had more jokes for his wife, Aubrey (Leslie Mann). She seem underused in the film. Amid the crude/over-the-top content are some positive messages about steadfast marriages and the idea that vacations form lasting impressions on kids. The acting is pretty good. While, Ed Helms might not be playing the same persona of that of the previous Rustys, he honed this role. I like his in-over-his-head normal positive thinking, father know best attitude. He was very likable. He delivers some great, funny reactionary moments throughout the film. Christina Applegate is amazing in her role. I like how her character was able to play to play, into the laughs, as well. In fact, one of the film's funniest moments, was her chug-run sequence. The like of supporting characters played by Keegan-Michael Key, Charlie Day, Michael Pena, Norman Reedus and many others, make this movie, a lot funnier than it could had. As much as the critics, might think, the appearance of Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo toward the end, as lackluster. I have to disagree with them. It was nice to see the two, play their roles, once again. Pretty much all of these cameos are used well, offering a solid comedy beat. I also love that Lindsay Buckingham's 1983 hit single, ""Holiday Road"", the theme song to most of the Vacation series, is include with this film. Overall: While, the movie could quite capture the inspired lunacy of the original John Hughes-written/Harold Ramis-directed film. However, this remake did pretty well for itself. As long, as you don't take it, took serious. You might like it, too. It's time to take a Vacation, indeed!",/review/rw4097716/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2015,CleveMan66,8," ""Vacation"" stikes a great balance between honoring the original film and paving its own holiday road.
","""I found out long ago. It's a long way down the holiday road."" Those are the opening lyrics from the Lindsey Buckingham song that is found in all four of National Lampoon's ""Vacation"" movies of the 1980s and 90s. Those movies all starred Chevy Chase as the father who would stop at nothing to give his family the perfect vacation, whether it was a European vacation, a Vegas vacation, a Christmas vacation or a road trip to California's (fictional) Walley World theme park. The holiday road is indeed a long one. It led us to all those places and backÂ… and then it led us here. 32 summer vacations later, a movie called simply ""Vacation"" (R, 1:39) is a remake/sequel/reboot hybrid which also features Buckingham's catchy tune. The question is whether this vacation lives up to the legacy of the iconic film that shares its name.",/review/rw4097716/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2015,jonathan-kj-2010,8," Ridicoulous, stupid, offensive and dreadful..... would watch again!
","Despite the movie is a over the top comedy that is ridiculous and sometimes straight out offensive and disgusting, the movie makes you laugh. I haven't laughed like this for a good while, so it does however do its job as a comedy. if you are however looking for a calm comedy that takes itself a little bit serious..... stay away XD It contains offensive jokes, foul language (often from the small ones) over-dramatic scenes with plot twists, scrap that! there is plot twists everywhere, but the movie is for some reason able to keep you entertained as you try to pick up all the popcorn you dropped on the floor after laughing hysterically from a really bad line that just turns even more awkward as the other character replies back. A must watch mess for the ones that needs a good laugh, and bring a friend. It makes the movie 10 time better when a cheap but funny line comes up and both of you can relate XD",/review/rw4097716/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2015,bryank-04844,8," 'Vacation' film has already earned the stamps on its passport and is ready for its next vacation.
","""We're on a pilgrimage to see a moose. Praise Marty Moose!"" Those were wise, unearthing words from America's family man Clark W. Griswold (Chevy Chase) as he trekked his family from Chicago to California inside the Griswold family truckster back in 1983. Clark, along with his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), and their two kids Rusty (Anthony Michael Hall) and Audrey (Dana Barron) encountered a variety of hilarious obstacles and problems along their difficult road trip, but they stuck together as a family and proved that any American family can make it across country without killing one another...mostly.",/review/rw4097716/?ref_=tt_urv

31 July 2015,PWNYCNY,10," Extremely funny movie.
","Here's a movie that casts aside even the pretense of sophistication in favor of bathroom humor. Bathroom humor abounds. Subtle nuances are set aside as the Griswolds, and their friends, wallow in the muck, and generate ongoing laughs. Rusty Griswold is a raunchier version of Clark. Rusty is more than just a doofus, he is the personification of stupidity itself. Rusty is arguably the most stupid movie character in recent movie history. He's up there with Stan Laurel. Lou Costello and Curly Howard. Everything about Rusty exudes a naivety that goes way beyond mere ignorance. He has a stupid streak that even his eight year son can't miss. Everyone knows that Rusty is stupid, everyone, of course, except Rusty. The other extremely amusing character is Rusty's oldest son, who is effeminate. The father-son relationship here is hilarious. Rusty is completely oblivious to his son's sexual identity issues, producing comic situations. It's not that Rusty is inherently mean, rather, he's just too dense to know any better. Remember: he's a Griswold.",/review/rw4097716/?ref_=tt_urv

","Do not let the 6.1 star rating here in imdb fool you, for a modern road trip comedy this was amazing.

","Director/Writers Jonathan M.

The fastest distance between two points is never a straight line for the Griswold's, and that propels the cross-country high-jinks forward. Helms' knows how to push a joke without over doing it, while Applegate continues to prove beauty and comedy are a good mix.

29 July 2015,Pumpkin_Man,10," A Dirtier and Raunchier Vacation for the Next Generation of Griswolds!!!
","After 18 years, the Griswolds are finally back in action. This is definitely a 'passing of the torch' sequel, not a remake. I've always had a soft spot for the Vacation movies. I grew up with them and saw Vegas Vacation in the theater when I was 7. I was super psyched when this sequel was announced. I just wish Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo had more screen time. They only appear for about five minutes toward the end of the film. There are plenty of references and throw backs to the previous Vacation movies. While European, Christmas and Vegas Vacation were more family friendly and light hearted, this one goes back to the roots of the original with a very hard 'R' rating with lots of cussing, dark humor, dirty sex jokes and crude humor, which I enjoy. Audrey's character felt out of place. Leslie Mann probably wasn't a good choice for her. She was nothing like Audrey from the other movies. She was there just for the sake of having her character in it, much like Chevy and Beverly Ed Helms did fairly good as portraying Rusty Griswold. ",/review/rw4097716/?ref_=tt_urv

",It's getting annoying seeing reviews giving this film a 1/10 because people have misinterpreted 'Vacation' for a family film and been disgusted by it. It's crude humour and outrageously funny if you like movies like Due Date and The Hangover and deserves more than a 1/10 (Mums who haven't bothered to check the rating).,/review/rw4097716/?ref_=tt_urv

3 August 2015,zardoz-13,9," Hilarious Hokum!!!
","If you enjoyed the audacious ""Hangover"" movie trilogy and the two impudent ""Horrible Bosses"" epics, then you will probably hoot at the reboot of the vintage Chevy Chase comedy ""National Lampoon's Vacation."" Not only does the new ""Vacation"" qualify as a remake, but it also serves as a sequel to the four film ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" franchise. Ed Helms stars as Clark W. Griswold's grown-up son Russell 'Rusty' Griswold. For the record, Anthony Michael Hall played Rusty in ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" (1983) while different actors have slipped into and out of the same role in the various other ""Vacation"" inspired sequels. Anyway, Helms plays Rusty as a married man, with a wife, Debbie (sexy Christina Applegate), and two sons, James (Skyler Gisondo) and Kevin Griswold (Steele Stebbins). Comparatively, Clark raised a son and a daughter. The basic premise remains similar despite the 32 year gap between the movies. Oblivious Russell cherishes fond memories of the catastrophic cross-country road-trip that his quixotic father charted for the family and its farcical finale at Walley World. Indeed, much of the same thing occurs again. Co-directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein, who wrote both ""Horrible Bosses"" comedies, have ratcheted up the raunch content considerably for bigger, more brazen laughs that may either alienate or engross audiences depending on individual prudery. Incongruity is the cornerstone of great comedy, and ""Vacation"" delivers laughs and gags galore that more often than not ridicule the characters with whom we are supposed to identify. Actually, Ed Helms, who endured no end of ignominy in the depraved ""Hangover"" movies, emerges from ""Vacation"" looking reasonably respectable. ""Thor's"" Chris Hemsworth has a field day poking fun at his masculinity. Happily, as if to bestow their seal of approval on this side-splitting sequel, Chevy Chase appears in a cameo as a bed and breakfast owner with Beverly D'Angelo reprising her role as his wife Ellen.",/review/rw4097716/?ref_=tt_urv

A real pathetic attempt with each joke not working at all and making the parents look like imbeciles with no payoff yet maybe this is the reality of what Americans like to watch and behave like. Makes you wonder what kind of message the writers want to send out there on parents using comedy. Not funny at all.. and it had no flow whatsoever like the other Chevy Chase movies.
