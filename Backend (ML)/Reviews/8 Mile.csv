22 August 2021,SnoopyStyle,7," interesting Cronenberg
","Tasya Vos (Andrea Riseborough) is the Possessor. She's a corporate assassin who uses a brain implant to take over other people to do the killing. Her boss is Girder (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Her next take-over target is Colin Tate (Christopher Abbott) who is dating Ava Parse (Tuppence Middleton), the daughter of tech tycoon John Parse (Sean Bean).",/review/rw6239078/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2021,Cineanalyst,8," This Is Not a Pipe
","Some artful notions swirling around in this one, ""Possessor,"" but not necessarily always amounting to much. A conclusion of a loss of empathy seems especially trite to me. There's so much more potential here than some character arch. More than the satire on the real world, too.",/review/rw6239078/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2020,Rendanlovell,7," Hm
","This should be retitled,""Too Much but also not enough"". There are so many ideas pulling the movie in so many different directions. It's ideas the movie, but rarely does an idea get fully realized here. This has me torn on how I feel. On one hand, there is a unique tone to this. It's like Assassin's Creed meets inception. People possessing other people's bodies to preform hits on specific people for political or social gain is a solid premise on it's own. Throw in some great ultra violent gore effects, good performances, and some moody, atmospheric music and you get some really striking scenes. On the other hand, the movie is overly ambitious. There's so much it establishes there's no way it can accomplish it all, and it doesn't. This is exemplified in the first act which feels horribly rushed. We get less then 20 minutes establishing characters, premise, and themes. It feels like it can't wait to move through the set up and what results is a lack of investment from me. We hardly know who anyone is or why they are doing anything. The main character is having a psychological melt down as a result from over working inside this possessor machine but she only takes like a half day off to recover. Then she's right back to work. There's barely motivation for this and in her half day off all she does is sit around at home with her ex. You needed more scenes explaining to us what lead to her breaking up with him and more establishment of why she would want to go back to him. We don't know these people or their story and we leave them so quickly it's hard to care about them at all. We literally get one scene of her away from her work, and it's nothing out of the ordinary as far as normal day goes. Why is she a workaholic? Her home life seems fine to me. Why won't she tell her superiors that she's having a mental breakdown? Is it supposed to be a metaphor about her dependency on work to avoid her real life? If that's the case then why don't we get more scenes showing why she would be avoiding her life? It's a messy movie, full of vague characters and even murkier story progression. Even though the first act is rushed, at least it sets some interesting things up. The second act is where the movie really faulters though. It feels like the same scenes happening over and over again. It gets really tedious watching a character saying the possessed person is acting weird over and over. There are some cool, trippy, drug like sequences showing the main character having more internal breakdowns but I got the point after the first time. Yeah she's not stable enough to be in there and the longer she is, the worse it will get. I get it. We don't need to see it 27 times. This is weird because the first act has the exact opposite problem. Like Inception these people are trying to accomplish something by manipulating others for their gain. Unlike Inception, where the first half of the movie is establishing characters, story motivations, and potential speed bumps, Possessor only seems interested in establishing the story speed bumps. We don't get a clear sense of character motivation or why the story is happening in the first place. This possessor company wants to own this large tech company? But why? Who knows! The real story is about the Possessor and the Possessy who go to war over who should have control over the body. So why even mention that they want to absorb this tech company? Instead, say that she needs to kill these people just because they are evil or corrupt. That wouldn't change what the movie is going for and it would clean up the story a bit. The whole point is the struggle between the possessed dude and the possessor and coming to terms with the horrible things that happened. It's kinda like watching someone with split personality disorder. Which, again, is an idea that could've and should've been fleshed out. It only comes up near the end and is wrapped up so quickly I don't know why they even bothered. The first act is completely rushed, the second act is drawn out to no end, and the third act introduces more things it can't quite pull off. So...eh?",/review/rw6239078/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2020,BandSAboutMovies,4," I wanted to like it
","The same thing always happens. A movie gets hyped, I buy in and get excited, then watch it and am mildly interested in it and wonder what all the fervor was all about. It happened all over again with Possessor (or Possessor Uncut), which is not the alternate title to Horror Express (Â©Bill Van Ryn for that joke) and it's not one of the movies within a movie within Popcorn.",/review/rw6239078/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2020,amonteirojr,8," Daddy must be proud
","There aren't enough people doing this kind of stuff anymore, you know, the kind of movies David Cronenberg used to do, low budget but well crafted, high concept and not afraid to disturb, then lo and behold, looks like his son took the torch and I couldn't be happier. Possessor has some great performances and nice visual choices, the body horror bits do not disappoint as well and I thought the narrative was engaging from start to finish, found no issues with the pacing whatsoever.",/review/rw6239078/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2020,kirbylee70-599-526179,7," HIGH TECH HIT
","One of the greatest directors from the 70s forward who put forth the idea of science fiction with body modification and manipulation was David Cronenberg. Imagine being the son of Cronenberg and having to live up to his record of films. It appears that his son Brandon is doing just that and succeeding. His latest film does just that and more, creating a science fiction premise that is frightening and fascinating at the same time.",/review/rw6239078/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2020,Clearbay_327,," TL;DR Violent and disturbing, anchored by outstanding performances
","In this film, set in the near future, brain implant technology allows one person to inhabit the mind, body, and spirit of another. A clandestine corporation uses this technology to assassinate wealthy and powerful people for profit. The film explores what happens when the host starts to fight to regain control from a guest who is not entirely mentally stable, to begin with.",/review/rw6239078/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2020,fciocca,5," An ethereal movie with lots of good ideas, but the development is mediocre and disappointing
","The incipit is really good: an agency that perform contract killings, use a very innovative technology that implants a device on the brain of a designated target that allows to the killer to remotely wire. Therefore the person is replaced, his free will is canceled and the killer is then able to complete the assignment, without being directly involved. The concept is really good, but the movie has a lot of issues.",/review/rw6239078/?ref_=tt_urv

","... not only in the main characters but channelling throughout this unoriginal take on nothing you haven't seen before but perhaps with a bit more gore, torment and brutality, although you're never really sure why and you'll find a point close to the middle when you won't really care - valueless with some reasonable effects.",/review/rw6239078/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2021,FeastMode,4," shock value and not much else
","I enjoyed the shock value moments, but that can't be all there is. It's an interesting premise but it goes almost nowhere. They only take it in one direction but that's more than an hour into the movie. It's well made from a technical perspective, but it had trouble keeping me invested and i felt bored and unsatisfied (1 viewing, 4/8/2021)",/review/rw6239078/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2021,fluffchop,5," Good in the first 1/2 then bogs down
",An interesting if not totally pointless premise leads to an interesting if not totally pointless story. At first it's interesting but then stops on one character for the entirety of the movie. This isn't good because it wastes the very notion set up by the premise. We could have had multiple characters undergoing this process yet instead we are left with what turns into a fairly pedestrian affair.,/review/rw6239078/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2020,exlana,5," Visually good, but..
","... that's pretty much it. It just looks good. Well, the acting is alright too, i guess. The pacing is way too slow, literally 2/3 could've been cut into a 12 minutes run time. Though the concept is nice, they didn't able to make an interesting plot (if even there's any plot at all). The ""weird imagery"" and ""violent"" that sole purpose to make it edgy-artsy, didn't work. It ended up boring and dull.",/review/rw6239078/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2020,chrislawuk,8," one of the better horror movies I seen in a while
","Similar in ways to existenz and videodrome themes. Really been missing David Cronenberg as he hasnt made many movies recently, so glad to see his sons taken over. His films are getting much better, this one being my favourite by miles so far. Excellent use of London set, nice camera work and its a real gorefest. It doesnt hold back in that respect, and some of the visual dream sequences were 1st class. Its not a perfect film by any means but has a number of strengths that horror film fans will appreciate.",/review/rw6239078/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2021,Stevieboy666,8," Wow!
","I had heard great things about Possessor Uncut and eagerly looked forward to watching it. This British/Canadian science fiction/horror is the most brutal movie that I have seen for a while and knocks spots off the vast majority of today's offerings. Directed by Brandon Cronenberg, he certainly is a chip off the old block (David). I have to admit that the plot is not always to follow, I am sure that repeat viewings would help make things clearer (alternatively read a full synopsis). The violence and gore is extreme, plus there are a few scenes of very strong sex and nudity. The sets and locations look good and the acting is excellent. I found the movie impressive and look forward to watching it again, however this is most certainly not a film for everyone.",/review/rw6239078/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2020,A_Different_Drummer,4," Textbook disconnect between critics and public
","It is almost as if, with the advent of streaming media, the critics are desperate for an actual feature to gush over. They picked the wrong movie. There are clever bits here and there, but the directors endless love affair with the tropes of low-budget film making, static scenes, dim lighting -- all these will ultimately disappoint. And the gushers would do well to remember that the director's father may have started with low-budget productions but eventually graduated to blockbusters like A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. We can only hope.",/review/rw6239078/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2021,siderite,6," Too Cronenberg for no reason at all
","The son of David Cronenberg wants to to a movie like Existenz, but he ultimately fails to do so. The acting is good, but the plot is really drawn out and says almost nothing in the end. Also, as many others noted, there is some gratuitous gore and violence put in which doesn't really advance the story in any way, and that extends to some other things as well.",/review/rw6239078/?ref_=tt_urv
