","If the Sopranos had relied on this film to launch the tv series, the show would never had been released.",/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2022,grantss,6," Disappointing
","It is the late 1960s and Dick Moltisanti is a leading figure in the Newark Mafia. His son, Dickie, takes after him and is rising up through the ranks. Dickie is a father figure to a boy who will ultimately run his own crime family, Tony Soprano.",/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2021,southdavid,6," An offer you could refuse.
","I think I'm right in saying that this is another one of the films that is going to open on ""HBO Max"" in the States, rather than widely at the cinema. Here in the UK, we have had a cinematic release and as a fan of ""The Sopranos"" I jumped at the chance go. Though I wouldn't go as far as to say I was disappointed, I came away unsure as to the point of what I'd seen.",/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2021,random-70778,," Essentially fan service that ultimately is a mediocre narrative mess
","Really? All that talent and money, and yet overall this is a meandering narrative mess that doesn't know what story it wants to tell. It is more or less a hodgepodge of cameos by younger versions of the TV series characters superimposed over a laughably shallow and revisionist narrative on the riots that destroyed Newark NJ.",/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2021,mm-39,6," Disappointment, and a let down.
","I like the Sopranos and T M S o N is a disappoint, and a let down. I liberally give a 6 because I liked young Tony, and a few characters actors. Tony had no healthy parental influence made for the making of Tony S story line. Tony and the family part of the movie I gave a 8. There is few dysfunctional family moments, and bad characters which resonates with the past series. Regrettable, many characters and story lines had nothing to do with the Sopranos, or the mob. I don't know if the makers tried to be woke, artistic, or just preachy! Bad enough movie one guy left. Disjointed, badly written, another silly woke movie just using the Soprano name. So silly half the film had nothing to with the story. I thought parts of the film are just random. More like a film about a messed up Dickie character , which gets boring. Random, crazy which I thought would turn into a story, but no. 6 stars should be 4 but I am sentimental for the series.",/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,sdowen-59793,6," Not the movie fans of the Sopranos wanted
",They made a movie about Dickie Moltisanti. Most Soprano fans couldn't give a damn about Dickie. He's a background character.,/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2021,thompson12001,6," Probably Not Chases's Full Vision
",This movie was pretty meh. It would've been a lot better if all the time they spent on Harold was deleted and used for scenes with Tony and Dickie as well as actually building up real tension between Junior and Dickie.,/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2021,jadavix,4," David Chase should have trusted his instinct
","Remember when ""The Sopranos"" took the television show to new narrative heights? Remember when each new episode was more anxiously awaited than any new movie? Remember when you wished more movies could be told as TV series or miniseries on HBO or Showtime, so that they could go into more detail, and take their time developing?",/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2021,snoozejonc,8," Thoroughly enjoyed it but recommend rewatching episodes 'Down Neck', and 'For All Debts Public and Private' beforehand
",'The Many Saints of Newark' (for me) is an excellent piece of Sopranos fan service with strong character moments and some quite memorable scenes.,/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2021,bluesparkles-59317,6," Underwhelming, but the acting is fantastic
","Jon Bernthal said this film isn't like the Sopranos, and I can see what he means. I walked in thinking this would focus on Tony Sopranos' route to becoming who he is when we meet him in the first episode of the Sopranos, but instead, it focuses on Christopher's dad, Dickie Moltisanti.",/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2021,iceman-johnson,3," should have just made cleaver instead
",All that build up ....all the time they had to fine tune this film and make it a masterpiece. What the hell happened ?,/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2021,JohnRayPeterson,8," Candy for 'The Sopranos' fans. I certainly liked it.
","At the height of the series' six seasons, half way through I'd say, fans couldn't wait for the next episodes, I couldn't; it was like drug addicts waiting for their next fix I suppose. I was one of those fans. After reading the mixed reviews of this movie, and based on the slate of actors in the movie, I decided I'd give it a watch and I did.",/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2021,paul-allaer,6," Sopranos prequel hits and misses the mark
","""The Many Saints of Newark"" (2021 release; 120 min.) brings the story of Dickie Moltisanti and his cohorts. As the movie opens, the voice-over reminds us that it's ""1966"", and Dickie and his nephew Tony Soprano are welcoming Dickie's dad and his new young bride from Italy at the dock in New York. Pretty soon thereafter the Moltisanti (""many saints"") family are scheming up more ways to generate revenue. Then one evening, racial tensions boil over after a black cabdriver is assaulted by two white police men... At this point we are 10 min into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2021,bangotti,4," Why? What? How?
",Why was half the film about racial tensions and a black gangster? What was this huge inspiration Dickie gave to Tony? How is this co written by the creator of the Sopranos?,/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2021,vincent-93104,," Another WOKE bomb from HBO
",Another Trojan Horse from HBO. An enormous pile of woke trash disguised as a Sopranos movie. When will filmmakers learn that everyone is sick of this gatbage?,/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv

",3 out of 5 stars.,/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2021,matt_jacobs1,6," Disappointing
","I had such high hopes for this movie, but it just fell flat. This isn't a movie about the making of Tony Soprano like the ads and trailers lead you to believe. It's a story about racial tensions in Newark in the 1970's and nothing more. Michael Gandolfini did an awesome job at playing a young Tony, but we only got to see him a handful of times, which was a shame. What the heck was up with the Frank Lucas scene too? Talk about pointless and making no sense!",/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2021,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,1," HBO sunk below Netflix
","I have appreciated HBO productions in the past. They are one of the oldest, if not the oldest quality adult oriented television producers. But this film sunk far below what I would have expected from even Netflix.",/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv

6 October 2021,jtindahouse,7," Don't expect it to compete with the series, just enjoy it as an add-on
","I'm a big fan of 'The Sopranos'. I think the most important thing to note about 'The Many Saints of Newark' is that you're going enjoy it a lot more if you are a fan of the series. There's an awful lot of fan-service here and not a huge deal of plot for the casual viewer to enjoy. For that reason I was able to enjoy it a great deal, but I can understand those who did not's point of view.",/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2021,randymcbeast,1," Sopranos fans are going to hate this
","I am a huge Sopranos fan which made it even more painful watching this than if I was just watching a bad movie. I mean, how can you mess up a prequel to one of the greatest TV shows of all time? You just wind it back in time a bit and keep the original formula. Well, they messed this up bad. This is nothing like The Sopranos and is just plain awful. James Gandolfini is undoubtedly turning over in his grave. I see most reviews are under 5 but it's currently rated at 7.1. That is such BS.",/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2021,wuapktjphq,10," ""The guy I went to hell for!""
","I am a die hard Sopranos fan. Watched the series about 7-8 times. One of the best TV series of all time and without any doubt my favourite. You have to watch the series to truly understand the meaning of it. For example, every scene took me back to the series.",/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2021,valleyjohn,7," The film doesn't do the TV show justiice
","I loved the Sopranos . I watched it religiously and followed the exploits of Tony Soprano and his friends and family religiously, so when the trailer for The Many Saints of Newark popped up , I was really excited but did the movie live up to my expectations?",/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2021,BoomerDT,4," The Story Stinks
","A generous 4 here...production values and acting are ok and very good in several cases. But the most consideration in any movie or play, unless it's porn or martial arts, is the quality of the story and TMSON is muddled and jumps all over the place. This is supposed to be a prequel to the ""Sopranos"" about the life in DiMeo Crime family, late 60's-early 70's and the evolution of Tony Soprano. Actually this was accomplished quite successfully in several Sopranos utilizing flashback sequences, showing Tony's father, Johnny Boy Soprano, a stone cold mobster who Tony idolized. Johnny Boy has been pushed to the side in the prequel, as Dickie Moltisanti, father of Chris, becomes Tony's supposed mentor. Dickie also becomes the center of the story, along with David Chase going woke with a subplot that takes at least 1/3 of the movie dealing with empowerment of black organized crime in Newark on the Mafia's turf.",/review/rw7409783/?ref_=tt_urv
