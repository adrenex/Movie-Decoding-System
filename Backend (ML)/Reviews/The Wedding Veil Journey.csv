",I can't believe they're cancelling this show right as I found it and binged it on Netflix. There will never be enough of Eliot and Margo. Somebody ovary up and pick this show up. Please.,/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2018,joshfanguy,8," Good show...who cares if it's like the books.
",First off I'll say I haven't read the books which I think makes me more qualified to give an impartial review of the TV SHOW without all the BS references to how this wasn't like the book or that isn't like that book or whatever. This is a fun show. It has all the elements of fantasy and adventure that anyone who enjoys those types of shows will enjoy. The characters are (for the most part) well developed and the actors are doing a great job with the material. A very good entertaining watch for anyone who enjoys adventure themed shows/movies or magic.,/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2019,jedinixo,9," Really picks up steam after season 1
","I am surprised by how much I enjoy this series. The wit and intelligence in the writing, the character development, the acting... all of it is terrific. Season 1 is so-so, and at the very end of that season it feels like the writers were told to kick it into high gear because the final episodes build story line after story line to set up the next seasons. In Season 3 there is an episode that is so heartfelt that I weeped both times I watched it and just thinking about the story that was told in that episode (episode 5!) gives me chills. I was very surprised to find this fun/witty show could evoke so much emotion out of me in one episode. That episode stayed with me for a few days after watching it, which to me that is my mark of brilliant storytelling - I just couldn't stop thinking about it. I'm hooked. If you watch and get bored in season 1, stick with it! You will be very glad you did.",/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2016,cherold,8," Excellent series with a tenuous relationship to the books
","If you've read Lev Grossman's wonderful Magicians trilogy you may find watching this series rather disorienting. The characters are all there and quite recognizable, and it's still about magic students and mysterious otherworlds, but it often feels like the series' writers cut the books into pieces, stirred those pieces in a bowl, then pulled them out and stitched the pieces together in random order, making up new stuff to fill in gaps.",/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2017,nexx-43314,8," It's getting better with time
","At the beginning of Season 1 everything in this show is really weird and artificial. The characters felt gimmicky and that got more pronounced when you'd realize they're suppose to be playing teenagers. The plot also feels rushed, you feel there is more content between the lines that you can't really read. Things get more interesting when the main antagonist shows up and from there things start to look a bit better. What really kept me with this show are the characters (despite the acting) because there are no good/bad guys. I mean, there are villans and heroes but even while they're doing good all the characters seem a bit bored, like they're doing it because they think it's proper, not because they feel it's right. In that way they seem more inline with modern culture that always wants excitement but can never get satisfaction out of anything. 
As this series is progressing through seasons it's getting better and better. The plots are craaaaazy, Alice in Wonderland level crazy, and characters keep growing with the story and changing which is surprising because I never would have guessed it from season 1. Highly recommend watching it if you like something different and out there ",/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2019,chrisstineb,10," You've grown up with Harry Potter, now that you're an adult watch The Magicians
","This is Harry Potter for adults. Yes, it's a genre that's been done. But it hasn't been done like this. I read the first book in the series and my dislike for the characters kept me from reading the rest of the series. The good news: the show characters are more likeable... but not entirely.
The Magicians embraces cliches. It's very aware of what it is. Harry Potter, meets Narnia, meets The Hangover. Yes, F-bombs are dropped like popcorn. It's laugh out loud funny(seriously, the one liners will make you cry) with a fantastical plot that draws you in and keeps you hooked. Bonus if you're into mythology.",/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2018,Jingleling,9," Never before have I disliked all the characters and still liked something this much because..

27 January 2016,atlasmb,9," A Journey Into A Dark World of Excitement
","After two episodes, this new series by the Syfy Channel has already captured my interest and my imagination. ""The Magicians"" is a supernatural tale adapted from the books of Lev Grossman, which I have not read. It will inevitably be compared to the Harry Potter saga, but it operates on a different level.",/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2020,ben-d-freeland,10," NOOOOOO
",I just finished season 5 and I'm so sad there is not another season or at least a spinoff. A new network like Netflix or Hulu or YouTube need to pick it up! I need more magician's to get through quarantine!,/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2017,fake_moviestar,9," Harry Potter/Narnia for Adults
","Wow, this show is really something. (Non-specific spoilers ahead). It's like a mixed bag of every magic book and show you have ever read/watched, and it has a little something from everything. The pop-culture references, as well as references to key source material like Harry Potter are very refreshing, and The Magicians finds a way to not take itself too seriously, which somehow makes it even more enjoyable. Potential viewers be warned, this show is not afraid to ""go there"" - there is some pretty explicit material and scenes, including strong cursing, drinking semen from a jar, and a violent rape scene. I watched the show on Netflix, and while there was a mention of RAINN at the end of the episode, I do feel like there should have been a trigger warning at the beginning. This show also deals with some pretty big issues, such as the aforementioned rape, PTSD, feminism, and abortion, and it handles these issues very well, in my opinion. ",/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2016,Tactrix,10," Hat's off, without bunnies, I promise.
",This is a concept for a show that we(the fans of magic shows/movies) have been waiting for. A show that progresses very quickly through the actual learning part of magic and can then ricochet into where they actually use the magic. They rightfully picked a cast of people who seem to know how to come off with just the right amount of nerd vs sex appeal to make the show a little of both but enough to where it enhances the story lines.,/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2016,Piestein,9," Excellent and nothing like the book
","I will just start by saying that this is nothing like the book (which I like) and it is done in an excellent way. They basically just took the names and two or three basic ideas, but that's it. Even the Main Character has a different background and skills. ",/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2020,SnoopyStyle,7," melo sci-fi
","Best friends Quentin Coldwater (Jason Ralph) and Julia Wicker (Stella Maeve) are fans of the fantasy series, Fillory and Further. Quentin is even treated for believing Fillory to be a real place. He is set to interview for Yale grad school. Instead, he is invited to attend the Brakebills University in upstate New York by Dean Fogg. It's a school for magicians and Fillory is real. On the other hand, Julia is rejected. She avoids the memory wipe and seeks magic through other means. Alice Quinn (Olivia Taylor Dudley), Penny Adiyodi (Arjun Gupta), Eliot Waugh (Hale Appleman), Kady Orloff-Diaz (Jade Tailor), and Margo Hanson (Summer Bishil) are some of Quentin's classmates. Alice comes from uncaring magician parents and becomes Quentin's love interest.",/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2018,scottmannen1,8," Slow Star, but It Gets Much Better! Watch this show!
","This show starts slow. I found that the further that I got into the show that the better that it gets. Admittedly Season 1 was a bit of a slow start, but there are many tv shows that are like this. It takes time to develop the characters and for the viewer to connect with them. As there are man6 characters in this show, there are just many more people that the viewer needs to connect with.
The overall story is actually somewhat fragmented in the first season; however, the fragments eventually come together to weave a decent tale somewhat along the lines of a Twilight theme with a Hogwarts or Harry Potter type of setting. Luckily these characters are not children as is the case in Harry Potter.",/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2019,tabuno,10," Magical Drama for Grown Ups
","12 January 2017. What makes this television services stand out is its amazing hard-hitting, edgy script that defies traditional storyline plots. Taking Harry Potter to new heights, this foul-mouthed, sexy version of magic offers up a Naria that is far and away mature, dealing with death, intimate relationships, betrayal, and plot-twists that elevate this series beyond the tame, juvenile pablum that has been produced so far. Oddly enough, the perhaps only weakness to this series is the sincere effort that scriptwriters have gone to be so different as to almost seem manipulative and desperate to ensure the audience experiences something truly different. This much darker and serious take on magic informs and reflects nicely on contemporary life in today's societal complexity. One on the most daring, bold magical presentations out there. Well worth the effort to watch, if you dare to experience the darkness with a glimmer of smudgy hope.",/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2016,louiseromero,9," I have read the book
","OK I must be the only person who has read the book! Now the book is a hard read. I felt you are NOT meant to like the main character Quentin. He is a very self absorbed introvert, who in the book just walks away from his friends and leaves everything behind for his pursuit of magic.",/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv

20 October 2018,dr-cornelius-119-743806,10," But in the end
","At first, season 1, I was blown away by the creativity and characters. But then, in season 2, when the series began to evolve from magic you might think exists to fantasy in Fillroy, I thought that this is the end for this series. But, with the last 4-5 episodes of season 3 I really began to understand and love Fillory. And the characters in the parallel universes. And now again, I don't want the series to end. Still have the last episode of season 3 to watch. And I really look forward for season 4.",/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2015,Dodo-phe,10," Much-welcomed Harry Potter upgrade :-)
","Clever and innovative approach to a not-so-innovative premise of a hidden magical reality, parallel to the world we live in - told from the perspective of a graduating high school student, struggling to decide what to do with his life. The narrative is well set, placed in the modern world with (young) adult protagonists; which immediately gives it somehow more real-feel, and makes it more relatable and interesting. And the idea it proposes - that the cause behind being an awkward teenager with identity crisis is actually sensitivity to magic - is a brilliant touch, with timeless quality and something that should resonate well with the audience.",/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2016,er_ouz,3," Annoying, neurotic, and utterly charmless.
","This show isn't about magic. This show is about very annoying, neurotic people in a soap-opera style setting. 3 Episodes in and I don't think that there's one character I like (definitely not the amazingly annoying anxious emo lead. Think Woody Allen without any humour or charm), nor a character relationship I believe.",/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2019,jonorato-63490,2," Season 4
","What a downturn from the three previous seasons. This season had underdeveloped monsters. A lame nonsensical subplot regarding the Library. Hedge witch tattoos that made no sense (I could go on n on regarding the plot and sub stories that were so so bad..) and most importantly the worst themes regarding suicide/death -- they were horrible, baffling and irresponsible. I recommend the first three seasons (which were stellar) but this 4th season n beyond?? Not so much. I am so disappointed and surprised with the decline of this season. Such a shame as this was one of my favorite shows n I read the book series because I liked this show so much...., I'm sticking with the books now n not really the show moving forward.",/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2020,lisannebraat,10," I'm confused why I like this series so much...
","It's so difficult to describe why you should watch this series. I tried to make a few friends watch it, but they stopped after the first episode. I get why. I remember thinking after the first two episodes that I was not sure if it was a bad rip off of Harry Potter or that all the absurdity was on purpose and actually a stroke of genius. After a few more episodes it turned out to be definitely the last one. This series is full of absurd but amazing storylines, characters with depth, and it can make you cry and laugh at the same time.",/review/rw5795357/?ref_=tt_urv
