30 July 2021,DeBBss,2," I miss the old F&F
","I've heard so many jokes about the physics in F9 thinking they were just overexaggerating, but no, it's really that bad. F&F is known for going crazier and crazier with each entry, but I think it's gone too far for its own good. Not one action scene entertained me; none of the scenes were creative, they were just dumb. Some may find enjoyment from how ridiculous it is, but I was just left unimpressed.",/review/rw7179703/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2021,sumtim3s00n,2," Charlize Theron's put-a-bowl-on-head-and-cut-around haircut needs it's own movie
",The movies are becoming just too stupid. Soon the storyline will be 2 explosions from opposite side of the tracks who fall in love.,/review/rw7179703/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2021,d-shilling-1,2," Enough. Red light. Stop
",Just utter garbage. To say this movie was written and made by a 12 year old is an insult to a 12 year old. This franchise needs to end now.,/review/rw7179703/?ref_=tt_urv

17 March 2022,MLDinTN,2," this franchise just gets dumber and dumber
","For an adventure movie to be good, it still needs to be somewhat plausible. This movie is so out there and unrealistic it just makes the whole thing dumb. Some examples, driving a jeep across a falling bridge but still makes it to the other side (forget gravity), flying a car into space and destroying a satellite by ramming it with the car, using magnets to take over a truck. Movie also introduces John Cena as Dom's younger brother whom just happens to work for the guy that wants to take over the world. Of course there is history with Dom blaming Jakob for their dad's death. And they have a big fight on top a big rig, just silly.",/review/rw7179703/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2021,CinemaClown,," Another Dull, Dumb & Disappointing Entry In The Fast Saga
","In the 20 years of its existence, The Fast & the Furious franchise has upgraded itself several times over the years. What started as a story about illegal street racing transitioned to heist thrillers with Fast Five and with every next sequel inflating the action set pieces & discarding physics, the series now enjoys the same status as comic-book blockbusters, glued together by its sermons about family. F9 continues this new tradition by taking things to preposterous heights and is another dumb entry in the saga.",/review/rw7179703/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2021,paul_haakonsen,5," This movie was so bad that it became a joke...

1 August 2021,elliotjeory,2," A very bizarre film
","This is nothing like the previous films, it's a mess. It's a mixture of bizarre random scenes like all the deleted scenes from the previous films put into one. The flashback scenes are terrible, it's so unrealistic it's laughable.",/review/rw7179703/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2021,nerdgasms,1," Oscar worthy
",Next up in Fast 10: Dom remembers he has a long lost brother on Mars played by Dave Batista and along with family is able to slingshot his Dodge Charger to space where he hops from satellite to satellite to finally get to Mars where it turns out his brother is actually Paul Walker in a Dave Batista suit back for revenge. Meanwhile the power of family is too strong for the planet and it ruptures but luckily vin diesel is able to jump into his Dodge Charger just in time. The planet had no effect on him cause of the titanium roll cage.,/review/rw7179703/?ref_=tt_urv

13 July 2021,italianchica-50135,1," They finally went way too far!
","I usually enjoy this franchise and have seen every movie multiple times. Unfortunately F9 was the most ridiculous, unbelievable, far fetched nonsense I've ever seen. It was so dumb to the point that I wasn't entertained. Talk about disappointing.",/review/rw7179703/?ref_=tt_urv

22 July 2021,zaman-78778,1," Illogical and nonsense
","This franchise was about street racing and now all of a sudden after 8 installments its about the same crew of below average actors trying to save the world from evil. If you want to see a bunch of people saving the world with their anti-physics and doent-make-any-sense sort of stunts, i'd recommend you put your 30 dollars on something like Batman or Superman because this film is wrong in so many ways that i dont even know from where to start.",/review/rw7179703/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2021,derekrsim,1," What is up with Charlize Theron's hair in these god-forsaken movies?
",Couldn't bear to watch beyond 20 minutes. Toretto's younger self has no resemblance to him now whatsoever. And that's the least of the utterly ridiculous things that the filmmaker's trying to make you buy into for 2 hours. Lame dialogue. I love British accents but this one I just could not bear any longer.,/review/rw7179703/?ref_=tt_urv

","OMG was this movie bad, had to watch Batwoman and the Equalizer to get this one out of my head! From street racing to outer space and cardi-B too, plus John Cena on roids. It just doesn't get any worse than that, oh wait John Cena apologizing to the Chinese people for calling Taiwan a country, there it got worse!!",/review/rw7179703/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,Dar Star,5," Hellaciously stupid
","OMG. Where to even begin? I could write pages of examples of how incomprehensibly stupid this movie is. Just take my word for it. It does have enough action and effects to get thru a sitting if you are truly bored, but it's a damnation of Hollywood that a 10th installment of this car wreck of a series will surely be made.",/review/rw7179703/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2022,boblipton,1," Pigs In Space! Cars! I Mean Cars! Cars In Space!
","Do you feel a need for me to describe the plot of this movie, the latest entry in the Fast and Furious series? John Cena has joined the series as another master assassin who happens to be the brother that Vin Diesel has never mentioned in his never-ending quest for family. The locations include Tbilisi in Georgia, to Yorkshire, which stands in for Chernyobl. The vroom-vroom of the cars is restrained in the first two-thirds of the movie; they're replaced by muscular men who once hoped to be actors punching each other without doing damage to either their opponents or their hands.",/review/rw7179703/?ref_=tt_urv
