19 November 2022,skip-98756,5," Falls Short if you are a car Enthusiast
","If you love cars and movies that embody that, you may find this one sorely lacking in that department...As a fan of almost anything Frank Grillo appears in, I was all for seeing him in this role, however, he seems miscast and I felt at times I was still seeing characters from some of his other roles, leak thru...In other words, he did seem thoroughly embedded in his role and thus did not, at least for me, come across convincingly......then the is the car action or should I say, the utter lack of it.. Aside from the opening scene of the Lambo vs Ferrari, which is played over and over again during the movie, there is almost no other car driving or action scenes worth mentioning in this movie...Compared to Ford vs Ferrari, its
not even remotely in the same league as far as acting or Content and thats being kind...This movie focuses on the life and loves and melodrama of the man's choices and the consequences of them... in that sense, if Thats what you want to see, its worth a watch but if you are expecting the cars to play an equal
portion of the screen time, you will be sorely disappointed... It does give a glimpse, into the mans life and its a sad tale, a man who had so much, yet had noone really in his life to share it with...
However accurate that is , who really knows?",/review/rw8690402/?ref_=tt_urv

","Not as bad as some make out to be. Certainly no masterpiece, but it is interesting. Really bad accents at times, but if that kind of detail doesn't distract you then any liberties with historical accuracy aren't likely to either.",/review/rw8690402/?ref_=tt_urv

","I love Lamborghini. The story of Lamborghini's history is truly epic. I first heard of a Lamborghini movie biopic and thought to myself, ""why?""",/review/rw8690402/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2022,jonathancanucklevine,4," Mark this down as a story that still needs to be told.
","Here's the problem: ""Ford vs. Ferrari"" was damn good, and set a high bar for a story about the development of these cars - and the clashes of competitive personalities - in the 60s. So when ""Lamborghini..."" fails to develop any of the characters at all and draw the viewer in to engage with and pick sides in the rivalries, we're left watching a handful of cartoon characters in which we simply aren't invested. While I've never seen any footage of Lamborghini (and thus can't comment on the accuracy of the performance here), Grillo played him like a soap-opera central-casting Italian. And aside from the pure animus between Ferrari and Lamborghini, engineering a new thing is actually very exciting - it's difficult and arduous and maddening and exhausting and incredibly rewarding. But did we get any of that? Not really, only a few clips here and there of a motor and a couple of body panels and almost nonexistent characters who - in real life - would have sweated bullets in doing what they did. The whole thing comes off as a pastiche, and just makes me want to read the book upon which it was allegedly based to find its heart and soul. And we didn't even get enough great car porn to boot.",/review/rw8690402/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2022,vinstroke,5," Legendary story turned to disappointment.

","I loved all the feel of the of the 40s/60s, the actors were OK, just used a few ""profanity words"", beautiful vintage cars and Italian scenery but the story... It tells you in detail a part of the main character life, then you jump to another point and gets you lost on many things.",/review/rw8690402/?ref_=tt_urv

","2nd Edit -
I've just watched Iain Tyrrell from Tyrrell's Classic Workshop do a review of this movie on his YouTube channel (he did the review in early November 2022) - he also raises the Rolls Royce departure that I noted below using a 4 cylinder engine sound (I said Transit van to capture the diff whine element).",/review/rw8690402/?ref_=tt_urv

28 November 2022,nogodnomasters,3," For those who are someone
","The film opens post war Italy with the Lamborghinis coming back from war. Ferruccio Lamborghini (Frank Grillo) has big plans to build a better tractor, one that is smaller and less expensive. He achieves his dream. His wife (Mira Sorvino) dies in childbirth. He marries a woman who he does not love so his son will have a mother. The film jumps to the 1960's and with the help of Bob Wallace (Patrick Brennan) he produces the world's finest automobile, in the opinion of many. He has a wondering eye for the women and is an absentee father and grandfather concentrating on the car and not family. In the end his son asks, ""Was it worth it?""",/review/rw8690402/?ref_=tt_urv
