14 December 2022,gricey_sandgrounder,7," Not overwhelming for me. But nevertheless an interesting and powerful story
",It still amazes me how evolved the documentary film genre has become over the years.,/review/rw8815959/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2023,paul-allaer,8," One of the very best movies of 2022, period
","As ""All the Beauty and the Bloodshed"" (2022 release; 118 min.) opens, it is ""March 10, 2018"", and a group of activists is staging a protest at the Met, more particularly the Sackler Wing. We then go to ""1. Merciless Logic"" as Nan Goldin starts talking about her early youth, and how her sister Barbara commits suicide when Nan was only 7. At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the film.",/review/rw8815959/?ref_=tt_urv

","Really two documentaries in one, though they're inextricably linked not simply because of the person at the center but because of Nan Goldin's life, how open she made herself (through visual distortions but sometimes just with the total, brutal truth in photography) and how dedicated she was and is, as the person to be a major driving force in the fight against the Sackler's, in particular with their All the Money in the World style stamp on museums and places. But above all, it's a great film (documentary or otherwise) about community - the ones that Goldin was in as a young artist, as an art organizer in 1989 with the AUDS exhibit, and then in the past several years against the Sacklers.",/review/rw8815959/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2022,CinemaSerf,5," All the Beauty and the Bloodshed
","I have to say that I was really disappointed with this. I had expected a serious critique on the way in which the highly addictive opioid ""OxyContin"" had come to impact on the lives of millions of American citizens. Instead, we get a rather muddled chronology of the life of activist and journalist Nan Goldin, interspersed by the odd demonstration aimed at destroying the reputation of the Sackler family - all of the founders of which (and therefore the principal collectors of the art and the original altruists) had been long dead. We are expected to have far too high a degree of knowledge here for the scientific elements to make sense. It, at no stage, offers us any explanation as to what the drug is, how and why it was prescribed - what was it supposed to do? Nor do we have any contributions from the US Federal Drug Administration or from the medical profession as to just how this was being prescribed by qualified medical personnel the nation over, without any ongoing assessment of it's effects nor any signs of intervention from national - or state - medical authorities. It takes far too simplistic an approach to these crucial and equally negligent issues, is scant on detail and in the end comes across as little better than a one-woman-rant. The fact that Goldin herself led a fascinating and interesting life may well be the subject of a documentary in it's own right - she was an hugely creative lady; but as a documentary on an shocking issue that could have informed me, I found it seriously lacking and one-sided. There can be no doubt that this drug, amongst others, caused abject misery to millions - but this really does miss an opportunity to educate and inform and maybe even to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the policing authorities and the courts when it comes to dealing with large-scale abuses. Pity, had it laid out arguments and offered us something of a balance it could have been so very much more interesting.",/review/rw8815959/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2023,cjplourde,3," Nan at her Best..and her Worst
","I never knew Nan Goldin, but I lived in Massachusetts and the gay community and feel she has always been an ally. One of her friends was a friend in Boston, a young man named Tom who was a brilliant painter, who committed suicide in the early 1980's due to his alcohol abuse. A brilliant painter. Sadly, though he figures prominently in the film, his name never makes it in the credits. Why Nan?",/review/rw8815959/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,kelliekg,1," Patient accountability & responsibility
","When will the world admit the DEA & CDC allowed all these deaths? They've known about illicitly manufactured Fentanyl for over a decade! Yet admitted in 2919. Pill Mills shut down for 10 yrs now, opuood production down 5%+ ea yr, opioid RX down 60%, 20 yr low, yet- ea yr overdoses reach new records? Because it's not about RX opioids! It's about illicitly manufactured Fentanyl ! Wake up how many more have to die? Pain patients & Vets abandoned & committing suicide daily! Pills don't create addicts. Why is alcohol mnftrs not liable too? 93000 alcohol related deaths 2019! No one cares?? Genocide? Gov wants sick & disabled gone. Possible!",/review/rw8815959/?ref_=tt_urv
