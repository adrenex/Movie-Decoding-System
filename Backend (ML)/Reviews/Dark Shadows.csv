29 April 2017,morgan-659-312842,8," Well worth watching
","I don't know what the budget for this film was but I doubt that it was huge. Even so this is an excellent film about men and war and the aftermath of their actions. Although there is a some conventional war film action this is generally a well-paced, slow moving film which might not appeal to viewers hoping for non-stop action.The characters are well drawn and the acting is first rate. Hoult, in particular, is excellent but Cavill, as well, is fine. There is a little of the usual American gung-ho moments but these are timed and acted well so they help to define the characters rather than simplify them. It's not a preachy film about rights and wrongs and the Iraqis are, the limited fight scenes aside, portrayed as people under duress attempting to continue their lives as best they can. Overall a very good, thoughtful film.",/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2017,Gordon-11,," A simple but effective plot
","This film tells the story of a young soldier in Kuwait, who is reluctantly being sent to Iraq to help fix the water supply system in a village. However, their help is not welcomed by the village, and they are mey with multiple hostile attacks.",/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2017,stephenw-30180,7," Tale of an anti climactic mission during the Invasion of Iraq....
","Sand Castle is not an easy film to review in terms of gauging it against other high adrenaline, fast paced, action filled war movies. ",/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2018,Freedom060286,8," Realistic and Honest War Movie
","This movie is straightforward and honest, and avoids the clichés that ruin many other films about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.",/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2017,christopher-dallas-113-229541,7," Accurate, avoids cliché and worth watching
","The story was an accurate portrayal of the environment and the people in the conflict zones. It was based on the true events of the film's writer. Nicholas Hoult did a good job. I saw it as minimalist. He spared us the over dramatic self reflection/moral dilemma that is too common in writing or film. I thought throughout the movie that it sure looks like Iraq; it was filmed in Jordan. The areas I were in looked like images from the Mars Pathfinder. There were rocks, clay, sand and more rocks. During the winter, it was mostly orange. This is not a Hollywood retread or an action film. I'm glad that they had no flashbacks/flash forwards to home/U.S. Coming home and life after is a different story. The music score was subtle and the end title was really good. Similar to Brian Eno. Great to see another quality Netflix original.",/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv

13 July 2017,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," Felt like a good documentary
","Lots of war-type films have come out over the years, and most are OK to meh, but something about this one was done better than most. Aside from the exceptional directing by Fernando Coimbra, it's not like it had top actors in it, but his directing gave it a feel of a documentary/drama, and added interesting action and drama twist to it. Better than I expected, although slowly paced. It's a 7/10 from me",/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2017,paulijcalderon,6," A perfectly watchable War movie
","A decent and straightforward War movie. It's not very combat centered, but rather focuses on the soldier's internal conflicts. I've seen plenty of War films like this before and unfortunately this one doesn't stand out as that unique compared to many others. It feels like an extension of something you'd see on ""Generation Kill"". It's not necessarily a bad thing, because if that is your thing then you are gonna like this movie.",/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2018,jasonam,7," An exercise in futility
","After a small squad of soldiers is tasked with helping distribute water to an embattled town, a devastating series of consequences will change them forever. Shown from the perspective of a disillusioned private, Sand Castle is as much allegory as it is a retelling of actual events. While the main character does traverse an arc, the conclusion of this film may leave some viewers wanting something more satisfying.",/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv

9 March 2019,sophiahwright,8," 6.3?! Why so low?! This movie's a freakin phenomenan
","This is the best war movie I've seen made for Netflix, absoloutely bloody winner. I can't understand the low rating. Just watch the movie, you'll see",/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2017,jc-999-591106,9," Well paced, well acted, thought provoking
","For me, this movie was great in a number of ways. The movie showed the complexity of the war and the various parties to it. The main characters are well developed and multi-dimensional, their motivations seem real and understandable.",/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2017,blamberton-48681,8," Very enjoyable - describes a difficult conflict well
","After seeing some other disappointing attempts at portraying the Afghanistan and Iraq war, Sand Castle was a very pleasant surprise.",/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2019,arsalanfrq,9," Great movie!!
","Must watch. Its good. Soulful. Some action too. Many emotions. Sounds effects are good.
Cannot complain about anything.",/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2017,danwright-66262,6," Good drama with some technical flaws.
","Sand Castle will likely resonate with general audiences. The acting in it is good for the most part, as Nick Hoult pulls of his part very well. His acting is pretty spot on and the story telling around his character is well done. Logan Marshal-Green did a superb job in his role as a get-it-done SSG who reminded me of a couple different platoon sergeants I'd worked with while in Baghdad. The story itself is fine, and even though the outcome was predictable, I didn't stop rooting for the guys to get it done. Where the movie fell short for me was in the details. Coimbra should have hired a decent military adviser to help him out. A good example is found within the first few seconds of the movie, as Hoult's character strolls to a great tune by Queens of the Stone Age through a staging area in Kuwait (camp New York?) he walks past some tanks that are being readied for combat. M60 tanks. I kid you not. As an M1A1 Tanker myself, I knew at this point there were going to be some obvious flaws-and there are quite a few others-but they didn't really detract from the story. I'd probably recommend this movie to others for the story alone. If you are former military, just know what you are in for.",/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2018,kosmasp,7," Fiction in Reality War
","I don't even know what I would have chosen as a summary line, but reading another review, one from someone who at least claims to have been in the service and pointing out things that he thought were inaccurate, made me think, yeah that's what I should write. And while we all know that Fiction is a big part of movies, when they do portray something that actually happened (or happens) we the viewers do tend to take it a bit as a given, that what we see, is what happened.",/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2017,smazmac,8," Great war film
","Great war film to watch. It doesn't just flood the film with meaningless action but shows a complex story about the difficult relations between the U.S. soldiers and the Iraqi community. You can really relate to the main character Pvt. Ocre (Nicholas Hoult) as he experiences the challenges and brutality of war. Some parts of the plot were a bit simple, but overall I would recommend it. Some parts can be a bit brutal though, so be prepared for that.",/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2017,ellieaines,8," Great film, deserves a higher rating.
","The rating for this film is way too low for what it should be. It's a great film with good acting and a unique plot. Seems more realistic than your average war film and has good camaraderie between the main characters without it feeling forced. It's not cliché and isn't predictable like you think it would be. If you're looking for action, this is the film for you but it also has a lot of drama centred around the characters inner conflicts, it's worth a watch.",/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2022,jon_pratt12345,6," Not bad
",The story focuses on a young soldier and his small group of colleagues carrying out seemingly futile and overwhelming projects in the misguided spirit of helping the local Iraqi community. I was not completely clear if the film had a message and the character journey from apathetic to invested seemed at odds with the events of the film. The cast did fine and there were a few good moments but ultimately this was a middle of the road war movie.,/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2017,salehben,7," a watchable war movie
",it is actually a very good movie considering it has been filmed by a TV network (netflix) the movie writing wasn't great but it got some good lines and quote and funny moments too ... and the directing was kind of fine but it could be better... What i hated the most that they had some good actors but they didn't use they full potential such as Henry Cavill and Nicholas Hoult and speaking of Henry Cavill hell i still seeing superman when i look at him! finally it is a good movie and i recommend it if you have no thing else to watch....,/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2019,lewismillican,7," A refreshing perspective to the Iraq conflict
","Unlike a large proportion of war films Sand Castle does not follow the generic narrative of a mission of immense proportions that could change the course of 'the war'. Instead we follow a small unit which has been tasked with overseeing the restoration of a water system in a small town in Iraq. Not only is this incredibly refreshing, but it is done with taste, grit and class.",/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2020,shawan-01109,9," This is no fantasy rather reality
","It is within us that we don't accept reality that easy. We like to fantasize war like a fiction, dodging bullets and RPGs with a jump and break the enemies like glasses but that doesn't happen in real life. We need to understand that war is not fun and it costs a lot, its a freaking reality. I consider this movie a Netflix gem.",/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv

8 May 2017,mkbbd,8," Impressed by the story and the fact that has happened in Iraq War
","I am truly impressed recently by Netflix Productions because they are producing some great movies based on real events. This movie is no exceptional. Great acting and good good pace not like other Hollywood style call of duty type movie. It has story, struggle and tragedy...this what happening in Irag Afghanistan and soldiers and civilians are becoming the victim because of the leaders. Remember no one wants to be a killer and we all are human beings and you cannot clap with one hand. Overall I will rate this movie 8 out of 10 and worth watching.",/review/rw4992456/?ref_=tt_urv
