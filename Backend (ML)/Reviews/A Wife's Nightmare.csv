3 September 2010,benbe83,7," Cult Classic B-Comedy that needs to be Released on DVD!!
","Why is Ski Patrol not on DVD??? It is a true classic of the perhaps cheesy and clichéd, but wonderfully fun and endearing genre group of 1980s/early-90s B-Comedies. ",/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv

","It may not appeal to many viewers but I have always loved this film. To me it really captures the energy that being out on the slopes generates. There have been some awful reviews but its a comedy, its bound to be a little stupid & it gets my vote every time. There are many scenes that get me laughing each time & i've had the same VHS for years, since it was out in the video stores. My favourite if i had to choose would be the singing contest that Stanley and the ice man storm with their vibrant energy & hilarious attitude. I'm an art student and its a favourite of all my friends. My only complaint is that its not on DVD, all the out-takes, bloopers, interviews (there must have been some) and all the extras that everyone loves on DVD. Its a must see & don't compare it to conventional comedy thats now so old hat that its not funny anymore, this is a film that stands out on its own & deserves more respect than it had before. Re-release it on DVD please!",/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2018,francesmhill,8," Trash but I love it!

31 December 2022,paul_haakonsen,5," Fairly standard early 1990s slapstick comedy...
","Now, I had actually never seen, much less ever heard about, this 1990 comedy titled ""Ski Patrol"" before now as 2022 is about to come to a closure. And thus I sat down to watch it, of course. I figured I would be in for a movie in the likes of the many slapstick comedies of the late 1980s and early 1990s.",/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2012,KarateBoyBiff,7," Won't win an Oscar, but it's fun to watch
","If you prefer movies that make you think and challenge your mind and opinions in ways you didn't think possible, stay away from this movie. If you like movies that are filled with political incorrectness and mindless fun, have at it.",/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2005,jmclapp26,," A real kick in the pants
","It may really suck but I loved it! Police academy type movie with ski patrolers instead of cops! I really loved the horrible jokes played on each other and the horrible 80's fashion. It really cracks me up! Then again, my parents were ski patrolers and I grew up around 'em. AND the first time I watched the movie was when i was 8 :) (that always makes a horrible movie into a good one!) Personally, I found this movie much more amusing than some current ""dumb funny movies"". Besides, there really aren't too many ski movies that aren't a ""teenage party"" movie- or at least that i've ran in to",/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 1998,Bobbo-3,," One Really funny scene
","This movie didn't score well at the Oscars and there's no doubt why. It is a stupid movie but I did laugh at one scene. It's when Murray, a short ski-instructor, who's about 5'4"" is given some growth formula from his intructees. They switch the hem on his pants and lower the height line on his wall to make him believe that he's actually growing. One night at a bar Murray decides to go off at how tall he is and that's when the guys really get him. Murray awakes to find that he's too big for his own bed. He bursts through the ceiling of an Elf's Dorm  beside a Santa display screaming as the jokers take pictures of him. This ONE scene almost saves the entire movie.",/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2007,Squonkamatic,3," Notable Only For Being Out Of Print
","Not sure what the hell I was thinking but I dug out an old rental tape of this movie that somehow wound up in my collection and watched it last night. Life is short, ninety minutes of one's existence may not seem like a long time but there will probably come a point in my life where I will regret having invested the time needed to let this movie play, though I may not remember the title.",/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2009,today2012,10," Ski Patrol NOW on DVD!!!
","After over a decade of searching for this movie... I have finally found it available on DVD. I am letting you know the website only because I know there are many people who value and cherish this movie, and will do whatever they can to help others who have been searching over the years. I do not know much about the company, but I received (2) copies within 2 weeks of placing the order. The video quality is rough, but it matches the 80's style of the movie anyway.

14 May 2000,Quinoa1984,," Does anybody have a sanitary napkin?
","This movie is stupid.  I usually like stupid movies (Dumb and Dumber, Police Academy, Plan 9 from Outer Space), but this, takes the stupid cake.  This movie is so bad, only Dan Quale on NyQuil could remotely figure out.  I wanted to like it, but it's just Police Academy on skis.  And it gets dumber every time I see it.  Some fun, but it comes as slow as a turtle walking while eating a quailude.  C- (C- because it's so bad, its sometimes good).",/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv

9 May 2020,BandSAboutMovies,3," Woof!
","Rich Correll was Richard Rickover on Leave It to Beaver and helped Harold Lloyd preserve his film as a teen, a role he still works on. He's directed tons of TV, like a hundred episodes of Hanna Montana. He also produced the Police Squad! TV series and worked with Police Academy's Paul Maslansky to make this somewhat forgotten 1990 teen comedy.",/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2007,ArmandTanzarian,4," Would've called it 'Ski Academy' if they could've got away with it.
","This film is basically one of the poorer 'Police Academy' sequels on skis with the usual rag-tag bunch of 'hilarious' oddballs. Watch this film if you like seeing someone out of control on their skis shooting down a mountain going ""Whooooaaaa...AHHHH..WHHHHOOOAAA etc"" every 4 minutes. Haven't seen this for some time but if I remember correctly a hot-dog cabin or something takes a slide at some point. As per Police Academy there's the 'badguy' rival who is trying to get our heroes shut down. I think they end up entering a dancing/singing competition or something in the local bar cos they need to raise money to save the 'ski patrol' or something like that. As is always the way the local bar offers a prize massively out of proportion to what the bar would hope to make from the extra custom such an event attracts;like $10,000 or something instead of a few free drinks that you get at such things in real life. Watch this if you love your 80's style 'screwball' ensemble cast comedies and have watch 'Police Academy 1-8' too many times, or if you are traumatised by a near fatal 'runaway ski' accident and watching 20+ recreations of your accident in a humorous context will help you get over it.",/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv

",one of my favorite movie memories as a child was this movie i would watch this movie over and over again. it was pure comic genius to me as a ten year old boy. nineteen ninety was a good year for me in cinema i got ski patrol and mad house in the same year. how can you beat that but this is also coming from a guy at 10 who also loved RAD and ultra man well i changed my views in movies since then but i still love the hell out of ski patrol. i just watched it the other day on some movie channel and it still had the same charm for me as it did when i was ten. there is no doubt my classics are my classics. lest we forget about willow either. which is still on my all time top 10 list,/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 1998,emm,3," Lame-brained comedy is like the rest!
","Those goofy comedy movies like SKI PATROL still get on my nerves real bad! It's not funny at all, and just to prove it, the same old formula used in other comedies of this type gets ultimately tiring. Every time, we're bombarded with the lame jokes, endless runs of classic 50s / 60s oldies tunes, and too much horsing around. I had not gotten a single laugh out of this one. There are far better movies than SKI PATROL, and because they don't duplicate the same old formula thousands of times over. For Comedy Central lovers only!",/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2015,jessegehrig,1," Only if we all f*ck up real bad will they ever make a Ski Patrol II, or III
","Who even watches a Ski movie anyway? Why make one, are you trying to sell me a time-share in Breckenridge or Aspen? It's like a PG movie, as in zero cussing and zero nudity. What is the f*cking point of skiing related comedy at a PG rating? What could possibly be the pay off? The many fans of this movie are lucky lucky people, they have f*cking Ski Patrol to enrich their lives. Is George Lopez in this movie? Yeah, I just checked, he is, that's him, you can see him there, he'll f*cking live there forever, living in Ski Patrol. I mean, I'm watching the movie, and I can't help but wonder 'what the f*ck happened Ski Patrol?' just wondering it over and over again almost like a mantra, 'what the f*ck happened Ski Patrol?' Did you mean for this movie to be Ski Patrol?",/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2022,kevin_robbins,5," The majority of this film is more cheesy than good
",Ski Patrol (1990) is a movie I rewatched for the first time in a long time in Prime. The storyline follows a ski mountain resort that someone wants to sabotage so they can swoop in and purchase it for pennies on the dollar. The resorts only hope is a band of misfits who serve as the ski patrol on the mountain for the resort.,/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2022,IonicBreezeMachine,4," The producers of Police Academy reuse the same framework minus the name to unoffensive but diminishing results.
","At the Snowy Peaks Ski Lodge, wise cracking slacker Jerry Cramer (Roger Rose) works Ski Patrol with a group of other misfits who are under the command of tightly wound head Murray (Leslie Jordan). When land developer Sam Marris (Martin Mull) sets his sights on Snowy Peaks, Marris makes a deal with Ski School instructor Lance Finkmayer (Corby Timbrook) to sabotage Snowy Peaks safety requirements so the current lease holder, Pops (Ray Walston), will lose his claim and allow Marris to turn Snowy Peaks into resort town Marristown.",/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2001,yenlo,," As big a joke as the sport has become.
",It's no wonder that the sport of skiing has become the joke it now is when films like this come out. The gags are lame and the overall story line is idiotic. I got the impression that the film maker was trying to make a picture to somehow promote the sport but it obviously didn't produce that result. It wouldn't have been half bad had the slapstick been decent but that all was downhill as well.,/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2022,clownbaby-06006,4," The lesser ski movie
","If you're looking for a fun ski comedy, go with Ski School. Ski Patrol is the lame red-headed stepbrother of ski comedies. It tries to be funny but it's anything but. Tries way too hard.",/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2012,Certified_Teacher,10," A brilliantly good time!
","I saw Ski Patrol for the first time as roughly a fifth grader in about 92 on one of the premium channels at a friend's house who had an old school projection television. Those circumstances set the scene for the innocence and nostalgia that comes to mind when I see this film again as a working professional. Perhaps without having seen this excellent movie under said circumstances, I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much considering the early nineties fashion and overall cheesiness of the film. Ski Patrol is dated, but really good. It makes me wonder why Police Academy had several sequels yet Ski Patrol had none. The answer is box office take, I guess. Anyway, I love this movie! All audiences could take away great enjoyment from it. There is a camaraderie that is present in the Ski patrolers that will capture you. Cool ski stunts interwoven into the storyline will keep your attention. Genuinely funny comedic situations will make you laugh. Breathtaking scenery of the snowy mountains of Utah will capture your eye and make you wish you were there. Let's not forget that skiing makes winter worth it. That is a principal that this film will teach you whether you are a skier or not.",/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2022,jcrobles17,6," Classic late 80's; bad but necessary movie.
","Some ideas were great but didn't work on film. Old hacky bits never work. The plot we have all seen in Police Academy type flicks. What I liked were all the actors who made a career for themselves. Paul Feig has become a known producer director and was responsible for my favorite Freaks and Geeks. Classic Ray Walton, Bannya from Seinfeld, George Lopez, and Leslie.scene stealing Jordan. Awful writing and directed but again, such a quintessential movie for the time. Today is the land of reboots and sequels to comic films mostly. We need silly movies like this - think the last time there a comedy at the movies was Something about Mary. And the hair and wardrobe!! Haha c'mon!! Those sweaters?!? I had one of those 🤣🤣",/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2005,Trent1937,5," The best thing about this movie...
","I saw the movie when it first came out...I was a kid so of course it was hilarious. Now it just has it's moments. It was the original Out Cold. Same plot, different actors. Only to me Out Cold was more fun. The best thing about it this movie to me is that some of the music used in the movie is by Steve Morse Band. Being a huge Steve Morse Band fan you could put a song by them in the worst movie of all time and I'd watch it just to hear Steve Morse Band. Overall I'd say give it a chance because there are a few funny scenes. I caught it on satellite and had a few laughs but not like when I was a kid. But if it's between this and Out Cold (2001), I'd go with Out Cold if you want a funny movie.(Unless you're a SMB fan!)",/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2011,lmbrunet,," heaven no ski patrol yes
","Ski patrol is the greatest movie of all time. The perfect combination of slapstick humor mixed in with real life issues.. Raising money, ass grabbers, being short, developers,rocket skis as well wind skiing. These are issues most people deal with on a day to day basis. Without this movie i would have never known how to jump into my skis and save an eight year old girl from skiing into the woods at terminal velocity. If you have ever attended an ugly sweater party you are in debt to this movie. If you have ever shot the hole you are in debt to this movie. If you have ever won a talent show in drag singing dancing in the streets you are in debt to this movie. Any body who has disliked this movie or never seen it has neither tasted death. Nor lived life.",/review/rw2371307/?ref_=tt_urv
