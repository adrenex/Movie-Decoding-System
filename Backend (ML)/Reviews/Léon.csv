19 August 2017,bkrauser-81-311064,8," Off at the Races!
","Logan Lucky is first and foremost a heist movie. Arguably it's the first of its kind this decade, since the last time a really good movie of this stripe has focused on downhill good 'ol boys pulling an all-American snatch-and-grab, Burt Reynolds was still relevant. In its advertising the film mentions itself in the same breath as Ocean's Eleven (2001) but aside from both having the same director, the two couldn't be more miles apart. One's about career confidence men drinking fancy martinis. The other's about petty criminals snatching chump change from concession drawers. One's essentially Michael Caine, the other is Steve Martin.",/review/rw6369584/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2017,Alanjackd,7," A welcome surprise at the end of summer
",After a summer of remakes and so called blockbusters i popped along to watch this with no hopes or misgivings...I hold an unlimited card so went knowing the cost was immaterial.,/review/rw6369584/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2019,gjkrulick,8," Fantastic casting
","Each and every cast member seems to be perfectly picked to play their part with the exception of Hilary swank. Wowza. She was like a robot. IM FBI AGENT. ME SPEAK MONOTONE. MEANS I AM IMPORTANT AND BY THE BOOK.... Other than that, this is a great movie that is different than the average crap shoved down your throat regularly. Adam driver and the two brothers made me laugh. Daniel Craig with a southern accent and that feeling like he was always a second away from murdering somebody...The father daughter relationship with Channing and the super cute little girl was something that almost could have felt forced but it certainly didn't. Very well written (by whomever) screenplay and even better casting.... I could go on. Skip the blockbuster crap and watch more movies like this so hopefully more movies like this get made..",/review/rw6369584/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2017,spiritof67,8," Not The Film You'd Think
","I saw this film at a drive-in, and it was the second film in the double feature I had gone to see. For the culturally deprived, drive-ins still show two features. Anyway, this film was a revelation. At first I had expected that the working-class characters would fall into their designated stereotypes and we'd chug along to an easily-expected finish.",/review/rw6369584/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2017,bankofmarquis,8," Fun heist/caper flick
","One of the main reasons that I began writing movie reviews is to bring attention to good, entertaining flicks that might be flying under your radar.  Such is the case with Steven Soderbergh's latest heist flick LOGAN LUCKY.  This is an entertaining movie that moves quickly and has much more under the surface than you might first think.",/review/rw6369584/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2020,shimenpf,5," In my opinion, tried too hard to be clever
","I have to be honest: I really tried to like the movie, but ultimately I couldn't. I enjoyed some of the performances and I liked many of the jokes but, scriptwise, the movie is very lacking.",/review/rw6369584/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2017,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," Pure redneck entertainment!
","This film was better (and much different) than I expected. At first the pace seemed very slow and the story predictable and seen-it-before. But then the pace picked up and you really get into the characters (of which every single one was cast and played their role perfectly) and the story (which overall was very well written - especially the ending). The ending had an obscure twist forming, but right at the very end, it comes together for a grand finale! Very enjoyable and I'm definitely watching this one again. It's a 9/10 from me.",/review/rw6369584/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2020,saru2020,8," A very good heist
","One of the best heist movies made out there.
Edge of the seat kinda entertainer for sure except in some places where it went a bit draggy.
Could've been called as the best heist movie if more twists & turns would-be added into the plot.",/review/rw6369584/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2017,DJKwa,8," An inversion of the Ocean's films but just as much fun
","A few years ago director Steven Soderbergh made no secret of his waning passion for filmmaking. He announced his intention to retire from feature films following the release of 2013's Behind the Candelabra and cited his desire to pursue other creative interests. Well, it may have taken four years (and a brief stint directing TV's The Knick) to reignite his filmmaking passion, but Soderbergh proves his hand behind the camera is as assured as ever in the rollicking heist caper Logan Lucky.",/review/rw6369584/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," No-frills yet fairly daring; its earthy quality and folk-tale fun screech to a halt in the final third.
","Playing out almost as a less professional, backwater 'Ocean's Eleven (2001)' with simple-minded folk trying to pull off a no-frills yet fairly daring heist under the radar to support themselves the only way they know how (since most of them are disabled in some way), 'Logan Lucky' is a story mostly told without any embellishments and a real earthy quality that runs opposite to the slick trend usually seen in con-capers of the kind. It's entertaining until the third act screeches to a halt and the picture runs along for far too long after the main event has been and gone. The flick instead chooses to take its time winding-down until it tries to inject some unnecessary intelligence in a forced revelation that does nothing other than hurt the piece. Soderbergh tends to get distracted by peripheral elements that take too much screen-time with too little impact to be relevant. The motivations for all the characters are paper thin, too, and they're never fully realised so it all ends up feeling a little pointless. It is consistently fun, though, and never as predictable as it threatens to be, but it's odd that the director chose to come out of retirement for something other than the best heist thriller he's ever made. 6/10",/review/rw6369584/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2019,TheWordYo,8," Brilliant fun
","Great cast and unlikely.
Main star is Daniel Craig, this film is such good fun.
What you'll love is getting involved with the story more than you'd anticipe.
The trailer will make you want to check it out but you won't regret it.
Something to watch while chilling out and having a laugh.
Will you watch it again? No but you'll really like it",/review/rw6369584/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2019,gabethurau,7," That was fun
",I'd like to preface this by saying that southern humor is hilarious to me. Talking in an exaggerated country accent can exponentially elevate any film's comedic level. That's a big reason why I think O Brother Where Art Thou is such comedic gold. And Hell or High Water wouldn't be the same without the southern setting and chippy dialogue.,/review/rw6369584/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2020,yusufpiskin,8," Soderbergh Style.
","This was probably my 4th or 5th time watching ""Logan Lucky"". The movie ages like fine wine. Each new veiwing just gets better and better, and with each new viewing you pick up on something you hadn't before. The characters are witty, perfectly flawed, oddly relatable, and surprisingly ethical, which makes the heist they're attempting to pull off even better.",/review/rw6369584/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2018,nightwishouge,7," Southern twist on a familiar heist formula
","Steven Soderbergh has never been one of my favorite directors, but you have to respect the diversity of his output. He appears to be about as whimsical as a filmmaker can be, given the dedication and discipline of such a medium, taking on projects as they intrigue him for the pure pleasure of the craft and the journey of the creation. I almost wonder if he even pays much attention when his films are released; it seems more likely he's already preoccupied at that point with whatever's next.",/review/rw6369584/?ref_=tt_urv

His wealthy ex-wife threatens to move out of state taking their daughter with her. With his sister Mellie (Riley Keough) and one-handed Iraq-vet brother Clyde (Adam Driver), he devises a plan to rob the Speedway during a hectic race.

21 August 2017,The-Sarkologist,4," Another Cookie Cutter Heist Film
","Once again I'm not really all that sure why I saw this because even though it is a heist movie, it pretty much follows the cookie cutter script that seems to be the standard for heist movies. In fact I saw another heist movie earlier this year that was almost identical except that the main characters were pensioners who had been diddled out of their retirement as opposed to a bunch of hicks whose injuries have resulted them being left on the scrap heap, and when I say almost identical I actually mean literally scene for scene.",/review/rw6369584/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. When we think of public figures retiring, we typically accept that athletes, politicians and entertainers will no longer be honing their craft or grinding in their profession. Perhaps they will write their memoirs, or even dodge TMZ completely by spending their days fishing or playing golf. When Oscar winning film director Steven Soderbergh announced he was ""retiring"" from making movies after his 2013 SIDE EFFECTS, he simply transitioned to television (excellence in ""The Knick""). Most of us assumed it was only a matter of time until he returned to the medium that made him famous. This ""retirement"" lasted less than 4 years.",/review/rw6369584/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2017,rs403404,8," No need to press your luck viewing ""Logan Lucky""
","Logan Lucky tells the story of Jimmy Logan (Channing Tatum), a man down on his luck. He lost his job on a construction site because he has a limp he didn't report when he applied (and doesn't affect his job as a driver). He's divorced with a wife moving away who has full custody of his daughter. He has a brother, Clyde (Adam Driver), a bartender who lost his hand in one of the many wars. It's referred to locally as the Logan Curse. The Logans' simply seem unable to catch a break.",/review/rw6369584/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2020,adamjohns-42575,4," The Hillbilly Ocean's Eleven.
","Not a bad idea in its way, but a tad far fetched perhaps. Echoes of a Coen Brothers film, without all the unnecessary weirdness, although this was kind of kooky in places.
I wasn't sure I wanted to watch it after the first 30 Minutes, but by the end of the first hour I was ready to see where it was going.",/review/rw6369584/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2017,cruise01,9," Logan Lucky is entertaining and funny in a way. But a welcome back to Soderbergh's direction.
",Logan Lucky is fun filled with stupid humor and an entertaining direction that is brought to you by the director that did Ocean's 11 films. Steven Soderbergh directing another film after his so called retirement in the industry does bring a good welcome back to his heist comedy film. It is like Ocean's 11 meets The Dukes of Hazards in a way. ,/review/rw6369584/?ref_=tt_urv
