21 October 2020,mapika,9," A complex, realistic high school drama and a great depiction of the current Zeitgeist
","Considering the diverse storylines this series is so on point, well balanced and showen by very good, mostly fresh, young and thankfully natural looking actors; on top of it with great animation parts.",/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2020,epope-75082,9," Authentic & Real
","This isn't your typical drug/alcohol abuse, sex, & violence type of teen drama. It's more than that. It's about identity, hardships, race, etc. This show gave a more real high school experience than Euphoria did...and I love Euphoria. The authenticity and character development is what did it for me. If you don't like ""woke"" or ""political correct"" shows then don't watch it. This show is real life and if you want to escape that when watching tv shows then don't watch this because this show really made me reflect on life and I like that. Highly recommend checking it out!",/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2020,favbright,9," Don't understand the hate
","I really don't understand the low rating of this show, all the hate comes from closed minded people who hate change and representation. This is a great show with a diverse cast and a great story. It's one of the most authentic portayals of modern high school life I've seen in the media without the kids being overly sexualized or drugged up. It's raw and real and the acting is phenomenal. The ""woke"" moments don't seemed forced or like they were written by old white men. highly recommend the show!!",/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2020,SanciR,8," It felt real
","Grand Army does a great job at capturing reality, from the characters to the themes tackled. While watching, I felt like I had met the characters in my highschool years; they weren't stereotypes, but well-rounded, real and raw... nothing like the 30 year-old hotties we've become so used to. As for the themes tackled, the series does not shy away from serious topics and approaches them from a diverse point of view, without romanticizing them or using them for melodrama. It might not be for everyone, but I do appreciate the series' effort to give all teenagers something or someone to relate to.",/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2020,WhateverIWant29,7," Lots of depth, character development and current stories. More realistic representation of high school life
","It starts off a little slow but picks up through the episodes. It's a good representation of teenage life, the characters actually look and act their age. The teens also wear real/normal clothes instead of couture or outfits a 25yr old would wear clubbing. The storylines are engaging. Not as gripping or as much drama as say, Euphoria but very relatable ...Teens do drugs, are mean, insecure, have sex, have crushes, have fun, party, are trying to discover themselves and find their place in the world, all the while doing stupid sh** sometimes...that's this show.",/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2020,noahsmithmichael,10," BLOWN AWAY...
","A show that correctly reflects the real life adolescent experience is something I've been looking for and this show is IT! The design, writing, depth and more had me hooked from the very beginning. I highly recommend it.",/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2021,Imme-van-Gorp,5," Honestly, this show was just boring. I did not connect with anyone or anything. It's so over the top 'woke'; there is literally no other plotline besides that.
",Rating: 5/10,/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2020,hehelolgg,10," This is what teens are facing in America.
","First, I would like to say the young actors and actresses in this show are definitely the future. I look forward to seeing more from all of them. Secondly, the individual plot lines are well told and are really what teens and young adults are facing today in America. Third, without giving to much away, they showed every horribly difficult situation that young adults face (rich, poor, any ethnicity, race, gender, sexuality, religion) in their young lives in a very true form.",/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2020,anneoever,9," Quite good a modern teen drama
","Let me start by saying I am probably not the target audience as a non-American woman in her early 30s. I was expecting some mediocre teen drama as Netflix is getting (in)famous for, but this show is a lot better than the average show on this streaming service. Although I am expecting a lot of backlash on this series because it deals with racism and the cast is very diverse, I don't think that's fair.",/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2020,onelovek,10," Small Town America, Take note!
","I was skeptic and chose not to watch this at first because of the review rating was below 7. I was in the dog house and my wife wanted to watch this so I dare not to say anything. I watched it with low expectations...well, I was wrong.",/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2020,trealexander,10," More realistic than 13 Reasons Why
",Very realistic to what young people go through these days sad to say.,/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2020,brycefw,7," Stand tall and ""FREE THE NIPPLES!""
","It should be clear that-given the show's controversial topics-it will be subject to harsh criticism, as well as affirming support. Personally, I enjoy narratives that aren't sugar-coated. This is a real and raw look at adolescence from a modern student's point of view. Yes, there may be cliches, but the story overall feels fresh and original. I read a review that attacked the legitimacy and safety of public education. While there are cases that may dignify this opinion, most people don't have the means to attend private institutions. Instead of simply denouncing government run education, fight to improve it. No system is perfect, which is why it will take a cumulative effort to create necessary change. It sounds simplistic, but if this show highlights anything, it's that this generation will lead the charge to change the antiquated and divisive ideals that have plagued this nation since its inception. Stand tall and ""FREE THE NIPPLES!""",/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2020,POIguy,9," About as real as it gets
","If you want to know what teens are really dealing with, watch this show.",/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv

16 November 2020,Avalala,9," What amazing performances
","I don't understand bad reviews. A high school based show with some serious depth in storytelling, quality, production, and performances. Whoever casted these talented young actors and actresses deserves some praise",/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2020,jcreviensversmoi,10," As good as euphoria if not even better :o

15 January 2021,owen-watts,7," Support Squad
","Teen dramas are so hard to make, and even harder to like by-and-large. Either being awkwardly old fashioned, weirdly out of touch or so heavy handed they don't work. Grand Army is something else entirely really, adapted and expanded from an acclaimed play by its original writer Katie Cappiello. It is a worthy and very earnest piece of work - a sprawling granular teen odyssey with a superlative cast of incredibly good young talent. I wouldn't be surprised if this ended up being some sort of amazing relic that people look back on and go ""WOW THEY WERE ALL IN THIS?!""",/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2020,Zedyeti,3," Realistic issues presented in none realistic ways
",Ok so some things about this show touches on issues us teens currently face but come on it's not realistic how it's presented. Maybe things are different in specialized schools but these spoiled kids are idiots. And the stupid free the nipple thing would have been shut down so fast. This show is just another teen soap opera and all these reviews saying it realistic are bs and I go to school in Manhattan. Also a bomb went off. Near the school and no one cares? Yeah right lol,/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2020,soneagu,10," A movie way better than the actual rating
","The movie is very well played. Characters are credible, the plots, involving real life problems are real, and keep in mind that the school in the story is a top one, really competitive, in the city. AP courses are a regular for plenty of the main characters, so don't expect dirty language, lots of nonsensical bullying and rage above any limits. I liked this movie a lot also because most of the students try to solve their problems by confronting them in a positive way, not full of hate for what happens. They are trying to understand what and why things happen and strive to become better. The focus is on relations among students, or them and their families, and not on the ones among them and staff. There are some shallow approaches of real life problems, but they are scarce and not irritating. Could the movie had been better? Probably, but it fully reaches its intended milestones.",/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2020,xxxNomadicxxx,7," A boiling pot of typical urban living.
",This show puts on a great display of typical inner city life of kids and their families. They let the characters develop and slowly let the series unfold without rushing it. I definitely will watch season two.,/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2020,carrington_tray,10," Lots of depth I loved it
","I really hope this show has more seasons.
It was pretty refreshing. They took some age old high school problems and made them feel new.",/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2020,carrington_tray,10," It's so good! The people the camera shots I love it
","I don't know why so many people are giving it such low ratings. Compared to other shows it does fairly well with showcasing people of different races being teenagers. Not just the same basic shells of characters. Also the themes are pretty good as well.
The person who played Joey played her part perfectly. She is such a great actress. Definitely 10/10 recommend.",/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2022,lyandru-tambunan,6," Joey and her stupidity all in one season
","What is it with this Joey character, she is arrogant, stupid, loud, annoying, attention seeker, and over the top. Usually there is something that I like in each character, even the antagonist, but this Joey, I can't see anything good from her.",/review/rw7737110/?ref_=tt_urv
