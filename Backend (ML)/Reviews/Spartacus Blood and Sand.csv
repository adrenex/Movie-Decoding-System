20 June 1999,Tito-8,6," Routine story, but entertaining nonetheless
","Okay, so the plot was fairly standard, but this film still worked for me, thanks in large part to Rose McGowan.  She did a terrific job in this movie, and actually, she practically carries this film single-handedly.  To be fair, scenes with the detectives and her grandmother were among the best in the movie, but make no mistake about it, this is Rose's film.  This film is also filled with lots of silly humor, but unlike most thrillers, the jokes actually work in this movie.  You have to give the filmmakers some credit too, because they took a tired story, and they kept the predictable storyline, and yet, they made a good movie.",/review/rw0533921/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2002,Darkest_Rose,9," Sexy, Wicked And Fun
","Devil in the flesh is a story about your usual obsessed with teacher school girl movie. I've seen this story lots of times but this one is my favorite. Rose Mcgowan is so sexy and wicked that you can't take your eyes off of her. She plays Debbie Strand, a girl with a cruel past. Her house has been burned down with her mother and her lover inside. The lover just happened to be a teacher and Debbie's crush. The story is fairly predictable but it's a lot of fun. Debbie moves in with her morbid grandmother that treats her very badly but of course the grandmother gets it in the end. Debbie falls immediately in love with her creative writing teacher and tries every way to get him and no one better get in her way, or else! If you want a wicked fun time, definately see this movie! I would give Devil In The Flesh 9/10",/review/rw0533921/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2003,slayrrr666,6," See ""The Crush"" instead
","Compare this to 'The Crush,' and you'll see why that film blows this piece of trash out of the clich√©d water from which it was spawned.",/review/rw0533921/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2008,The_Void,6," Derivative, but not a complete dead loss
","If you've seen more than a handful of thrillers, you will almost certainly have seen this plot line before; it's just the basic stalker theme only set in a school. This idea has been used in many movies previously, and was also the main theme in the excellent 'Wild Things' that was also released in 1998. Devil in the Flesh is a very low key film and actually feels like a TV movie at times; yet despite this, it does at least manage to stay entertaining enough for it's ninety minute duration, which is quite an achievement when you consider how unoriginal it is. The plot focuses on a young girl named Debbie Strand. After her parent's house burns down in mysterious circumstances, she is sent to live in a different town with her religious grandmother. She also has to start a new school and gets that same locker every new girl in American school gets (the sticky one that needs a man to come over and punch it). Anyway, it's not long before she starts to develop a crush on hunky English teacher Mr Rinaldi, and she'll stop at nothing to get what she wants.",/review/rw0533921/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2003,jester-30,," Over-the-top and predictable slasher fare.
","My buddy Oscar has been on my butt for months to get me to watch this film... and I protested saying it looked stupid.  Well, I finally saw it. It wasn't that bad, but it was stupid.  I'd give it one star.  Rose McGowan (Jawbreaker, Phantoms, Scream) plays a psycho-teen who is basically a poorly written Norman Bates.  It's basically a bad POISON IVY rip-off, without the nudity and sex to keep it halfway interesting ;)  The violence is far more graphic, too, making this one a candidate for the ""slasher film"" genre. It's predictable throughout.  I'd love to say that McGowan does well in the role, but at times she appears over-the-top and hammy, so I can't even give her credit for great acting.  I've seen countless B-movies which were far better and had better actors.  This one looks like a bad attempt to cash in on McGowen's somewhat celebrity -- or her connection to Marilyn Mansun. Stupid.",/review/rw0533921/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2002,jtamburi,," It's very simple ...
","... if you are a fan of Rose McGowan, then you have to see this movie.  If you think you may be a fan of Rose McGowan, then you have to see this movie. If you abhor Rose McGowan (as unbelievable as that sounds to me), then skip this movie!",/review/rw0533921/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2003,Maciste_Brother,3," Weak effort
","DEVIL IN THE FLESH is a pretty weak FATAL ATTRACTION copy. It's very predictable and the film lacks ooomph to give this kind of story the energy it needs to become successful. Rose McGowan is hot and she's really the only reason to watch this. She plays her role in a campy way, which some might find stupid or annoying but looking at the quality of the movie, I think she did it the right way. This movie is pretty much cheese. Her best acting scene is when she confronts her grandmother with the old woman's cane. Movie suddenly became alive during that scene. Alex McArthur was also pretty good in his role. He's a very expressive actor. But aside from those two actors, and some sex scenes, there's really nothing to recommend about DEVIL IN THE FLESH.",/review/rw0533921/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2000,Brian-272,5," Revenge sweet revenge! Hell have no fury like a woman's scorn.
","Rose McGowan plays an abused teen who murders her mother and father in an arson fire, then she's sent off to live with her bickering grandmother which only worsens her. Finally McGowan develops a poisonous disposition by knocking off her grandmother and anyone else who gets in the way of her crush on her writing instructor (Alex McArthur). I was glad the directors made this film with a message that abused children are scorned the rest of their life and therefore the pattern showed how the attitude of revenge is taken out on everyone in society. And Rose McGowan was she stunning or what! She was just the right actress for this role her beauty, always did provide an evil eye also. Hey just think any female must be a little crazy to be called Mrs. Manson. Devil in the Flesh is a great film for all of you late night TV watchers to view highly recommended.",/review/rw0533921/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2010,Coventry,4," Where the Wild Rose Grows
","Ever since the phenomenally weird ""The Doom Generation"" I've had a wicked crush on Rose McGowan. Her natural bad-girl charisma and sexily shaped chin make her one of the most enticing actresses of her generation. Her starring in ""Dearly Devoted"" was therefore the sole reason I had for checking out the film, as you can already derive from the DVD-cover that it's a standard, by-the-numbers and rehashed nineties thriller. With its main theme of ""dangerously seductive teenage femme fatale"", ""Dearly Devoted"" is similar to ""Poison Ivy"" (starring Drew Barrymore) and ""Wild Things"" (starring Denise Richards) and almost identical to ""The Crush"" (starring Alicia Silverstone). Following the suspicious death of Debbie Strand's mother and her lover in a fire, the seemingly confused teenage girl is put under the custody of her strictly Catholic grandmother. At her new school, Debbie doesn't make a whole lot of friends, but she does fall in love with the hunky literature teacher Peter Rinaldi. It quickly becomes obvious that Debbie isn't your average high school girl, but an obsessive and deranged psychopath who kills in order to get what she wants. ""Dearly Devoted"" is identical to ""The Crush"" because the male protagonists go through exactly the same hell. They attempt to befriend their jailbait admirers and narrowly resist all the sexual allusions, but when they actually physically reject them down, both their private as professional lives turn into a living nightmare. ""Dearly Devoted"" is predictable and not at all suspenseful, but at least it's never boring and the female eye-candy compensates for the unoriginality. The twist-in-the-end is not exactly groundbreaking, neither, but at least it managed to trick me for a minute or so. Rose McGowan was 25 years old for this role in which she depicts an underage schoolgirl, but that's alright, because she looks terrific in all those skimpy outfits. Apparently there's also a sequel, but it doesn't star Rose.",/review/rw0533921/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2015,Uriah43,5," A Woman Who Doesn't Like Competition
","""Debbie Strand"" (Rose McGowan) is a mentally disturbed high school student who has just mysteriously lost her mother in a house fire and has to now live with her grandmother. When she gets there she immediately finds out that her grandmother is extremely domineering and wants to control her life to the utmost degree. Meanwhile, at her new high school she falls in love with one of her teachers named ""Peter Rinaldi"" (Alex McArther). Unfortunately for her, Peter has a girlfriend by the name of ""Marilyn"" (Sherrie Rose) and really has no interest in Debbie other than academically. To compound the situation another student by the name of ""Meegan Wright"" (Krissy Carlson) also has a crush on Peter and Debbie doesn't like the competition. So, faced with difficulties both at home and at school Debbie decides to take matters into her own hands and those who get in her way are in extreme danger. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this type of film has been done before and in some cases in a better manner. However, it still managed to keep my interest for the most part and it does have some good performances by both Rose McGowan and Alex McArther. Additionally, Sherrie Rose and Julia Nickson (as ""Anna Nakashi"") certainly didn't hurt the scenery in any way either. In any case, despite the fact that it followed a standard format and it's certainly nothing special I suppose it deserves a rating of about average-but no more than that.",/review/rw0533921/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2000,Juniore,7," What a GREAT movie!
","I love this movie. Back in 98 I was up late watching t.v. and noticed that a movie called DEVIL IN THE FLESH was on. I turned to it and was hooked in an instant. I started watching it because Rose Mcgowan was in it, but it turned out to be great. It was mature, exciting, and funny. I give it a 10/10.",/review/rw0533921/?ref_=tt_urv

10 September 2000,Quinoa1984,6," High quality, yet kinda trashy
","This film has some good bitch acting (by Rose McGowan who is relatively sexy) for a TV movie, but that might be it.  The film has a plot, but for HBO, this even goes a little far.  Entertaining, besides the flaws. Co-written by Kelly Carlin-McCall (daughter of legend George Carlin). B+",/review/rw0533921/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2005,howie73,6," Fun but unsatisfying end
","I really liked this as a piece of late night trashy noir cable junk because it pushed the extremes of bad taste. I saw it late at night and was impressed with the sharp dialog and witty put-downs uttered by its femme fatale protagonist, Debbie Strand (in a wonderfully vampy and campy performance from Rose McGowan). Yes, the set-up is contrived and the outcome is cheesy but along the way I was impressed with the audacity of the film's comic-book nastiness and the sheer determination of the protagonist to get what she wanted. However, what's most disappointing is the end, which merely opens the way for another film, without truly exploring why Debbie Strand did what she did. Another annoying trait in these films is to resolve issues in an unambiguous manner, usually absolving the complicity of the lead male. A simple-minded, formulaic tale saved by Rose McGowan and some witty one-liners. As for the rest, cable fodder.",/review/rw0533921/?ref_=tt_urv

She is forced to live with her overly Christian grandmother (Peg Shirley) somewhere near Hollywood.

16 February 2002,turtlewax182,," Cliche but I loved It
","I'm not sure what it is that makes me like this movie so much, because as I said it is rather cliche, but I don't think it makes the film bad just because the script isn't totally original, because let's be honest, nothing is original nowadays. I loved The Crush and think Miss Silverstone is a talented actress, but her appearances itself is too sweet for you to actually believe she was psycho, Rose on the other hand has established herself as a, let's say ""doomy"" actress and she knows how to throw those ""f*ck off"" looks around perfectly which made things a little more realistic. She basically carries the film, of course that's what she was supposed to do... if you love Rose you definitely need to rent this one or watch out for it on HBO because personally, I think it's cool and one of her better movies.",/review/rw0533921/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hey, that wasn't so bad.  It wasn't so good either, but it kept me watching to the end.  (Don't mistake that for meaning I found it suspenseful in any way.)  I kept hoping Ms. McGowan would get naked.  I wasn't terribly impressed with her performance (like the other commenters), but I like her. All my feelings towards this movie are of the ""this aspect sucked, but I liked this part"".  Flip-flop, flip-flop.  I also kept thinking it would turn into a ""Devils Own"" type thing and she would actually be the devil, but that disappointingly didn't occur.",/review/rw0533921/?ref_=tt_urv

","I LOVED this movie when it first came out!  I almost felt naughty watching it because it was just so ... horrible!  I mean that in a good way.  Erotic sex, a religious crazed grandmother, students liking teachers, teachers liking students, and a very naughty Rose Mcgowan!  I have seen Mcgowan in a few thriller/horror movies but I think this is the first time I saw her play the bad girl (if you don't count Jawbreaker).",/review/rw0533921/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 1999,BlueFormicaHalo,9," Camp at best with the lovely Rose McGowan playing a teenage murderess/vixen.
","In no way is Rose McGowan a fantastic ""actress,"" and I'm sure she doesn't claim to be.  Rose is, perfectly, a camp goddess.  She raises movies like ""Lewis and Clark and George"", ""Phantoms"", and ""Jawbreaker"" to more than they should be.  ""Devil in the Flesh"", a made-for-cable thriller which I caught one sleepless night on TV, is Rose's movie.  She plays a real bitch who gets a huge crush on her young male teacher (Alex McArthur).  Here what ensues is a more campy, more violent ""Poison Ivy"" clone, that actually isn't bad at all.  Now, many of my friends found it hard to believe that I, a teenage Atom Egoyan freak and Ang Lee-wannabe (although, no, I am not Oriental), could like such a movie.  Well, sometimes, people like me need to have fun with a movie.  ""The Sweet Hereafter"" and ""The Ice Storm"" were hardly fun movies, even though I adore them.  But, thank you whoever for making ""Devil in the Flesh"", a riotous, terrific camp joy.",/review/rw0533921/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2000,mcfly-31,," forgettable thriller
","Taking the term ""far-fetched"" to new heights, this was released during the tv and movie glut of teacher/student romances and it fails to add anything new. McGowan, continuing to milk her bad girl character persona, this time is a young wacko being shipped off to granny's following the suspicious death of her parents. Then the writer heads off to fantasy land, getting Rosie instant friends, a lusting jock who happens to live across the street, and teachers and students who openly swear at each other in casual conversation. Not to mention a totally intolerable grandmother, who's one of those religious nutcase types. And how bout Rose's skimpy outfits that most schools would disallow because of the hooker-ishness to all the skin she's showing. But most ridiculous of all, McGowan (and apparently most of the girls) becomes enamoured with teacher McArthur, who isn't exactly a stud. At about 40, we're supposed to believe this balding, non-descript Kevin Spacey look-a-like is supposed to be irresistable to these girls. I didn't buy it at all. Rose, who seemed pretty cunning in keeping her obsession at a reasonable level, all of sudden loses it and becomes too over the top with her mood swings. The film also has a sort of ""Dont Go In the House"" element, as anyone venturing in meets an unfortunate fate. The ending throws in a silly twist that will be tough for most to believe, with a dull, standard outcome that's pretty ho-hum. Which is why this goes into the forgetable nonsense pile.",/review/rw0533921/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2016,Leofwine_draca,2," Weak and entirely predictable psycho thriller
","A depressingly average variation on the FATAL ATTRACTION theme, this weak thriller never rises above the television origins. Every conceivable plot twist is unoriginal and boring, and the film never breaks from the typical mould of today's mindless rip-offs. Rose McGowan (SCREAM) herself is not too bad as the obsessed student, but the rest of the cast are an unmemorable bunch, especially the bland actor playing the teacher who is the root of McGowan's infatuations.",/review/rw0533921/?ref_=tt_urv

After the teacher refuses her love ambitions and two detectives enter her life for some new investigations about her mother's death, Rose starts a body count by killing her grandma, a sexually harassing school mate and a social worker one after another and finally attacks her big love with all the evil power that is driving her mad...
