11 August 2016,bkrauser-81-311064,9," Vulgar, Crass and Incredibly Funny
","Sausage Party is a foul, crass, mean-spirited little film that pits grocery products against the horrifying realization that their use in this world is to be consumed and tossed away without a second thought. Centering on a courtship between a sausage named Frank (Rogen) and a hot dog bun named Brenda (Wiig), the very fact that the discontented ten year old in all of us didn't just giggle at the thought of how they consummate their love is enough proof that this film is juvenile. Yet despite leaning, nudging and winking towards the least discerning of low-brow audiences, Sausage Party is funny enough to have people rolling in the aisles, smart enough to lend itself to cogent meta-commentary and vulgar enough to live in teenage-screen-hopping infamy. Make no mistake, this film is the brass ring, the real deal, the funniest film you're likely to see this year and given this year in comedy, I say it's about damn time.",/review/rw3561941/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2017,brchthethird,7," A graphic religious allegory (and not for kids)
","Nothing in the trailers will prepare you for this movie, including what it's actually about. SAUSAGE PARTY is an allegory about religion and how ridiculous it is, but also about how we can overcome our differences and learn to get along. Granted, there is no solution proposed nor does the humor rarely rise above obvious sexual puns and stereotypes (different foods represent ethnic groups, minorities, etc.), but the throw-everything-at-the-wall approach guarantees that at least some of it sticks. And importantly, for a comedy, there are plenty of genuine laughs to be had. Then there's the ending, which I will not spoil. Suffice it to say that it seemed oddly appropriate...and that you can get away with quite a bit more in an animated film than live-action. This wasn't the craziest or funniest thing I've ever seen, but it made for a few dollars and a couple hours well-spent.",/review/rw3561941/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2016,Screen_Blitz,9," Animated Seth Rogen comedy is as funny and irreverent as you'd expect
","Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have reunited once again in this incredibly raunchy R- rated comedy following their success with 'This Is The End' and 'Neighbors', except what's different this time is this comedy is an CGI animated feature revolving around talking food products rather than human characters (though there are a few). For a movie starring and written by Seth Rogen, you would expect to see a straight forward raunchy comedy with no-holds-bar vulgarity and abundance of four letter words. This comedy however, manages to squeeze in a surprisingly thought-provoking allegory to religion along with the predictably irreverent humor, similar to what we saw in 'This Is The End' which followed a cast of characters trying to survive the apocalypse. Featuring the voices of Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, David Krumholtz, Salma Hayek, James Franco, Bill Hader, Paul Rudd, and several others to name; this movie follows a wide of cast of food products at a local supermarket who live their lives awaiting to be taken away by the ""gods"" (shopping customers) into a world known as the ""great beyond"", a place of comfort and endless happiness. When they discover the ugly truth of what really goes on in the so-called paradise, Frank the Sausage (voiced by Seth Rogen) must rally up his friends to help save from the unspeakable terror that awaits them.",/review/rw3561941/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2016,TheOneThatYouWanted,1," Was this written by a 40 year old virgin?
","Funny story. So I went to watch this and 5 minutes BEFORE the movie was even finished I took a chance to ask for my money back and they gave it to me. They told me I wasn't the only one who did that and the manager and I had a laugh about it. The movie is just lame. Basically they tell the same jokes over and over and over and over again. It reminds me of that one person who tells you an okay joke but keeps retelling and killing it. Have you seen the trailer for this movie? Basically the trailer has all the best parts. The rest of this film is retelling of the same jokes you already saw in the trailer. I can write an essay about how pointless this movie is. This film was made for those mouth breathers who like Adam Sandler films, still live at home with their parents and never had a girlfriend in their life. Don't be fooled by the trailers, skip it. If you really, really need to watch this movie then wait for it to come out on cable and I can almost guarantee you'll change the channel after 5 or 10 minutes.",/review/rw3561941/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2017,TheLittleSongbird,4," A lot of rawness but nowhere near enough sauce
","The concept was a pretty intriguing one and unlike any other concept personally seen before. Reading the very polarising reviews, mostly from audiences that had people defending it and others hating it with a passion, and being aware of what kind of humour there'll be and what to expect, there was no trouble knowing what to let myself in for.",/review/rw3561941/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2016,FlashCallahan,1," Out of date.......
","So Rogen, Goldberg, and Hill worked for eight years to get this, what is nothing more than a sweary spin on Toy Story off the ground. My only question is, why on did they bother?",/review/rw3561941/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2017,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,1," Like being trapped in the mind of a pervy twelve-year-old
","Okay, first off, I'm not a prude, and honestly a few politically incorrect jokes here and there doesn't cause any harm. The problem with Sausage Party is that it's trying to be edgy and innovative by being so excessively low-brow and offensive that it just becomes annoying. Watching it was like reading the comments section of a YouTube video. The ""humour"" in this film consists mainly of sex jokes, a rape joke that really crossed the line, swearing non-stop, non-stop jokes about the correlation between sausages and pen!ses, and this more or less sums up the whole film. It's nothing we haven't all seen before, but it tries to pass itself off as some groundbreaking animated comedy masterpiece when in reality, it's just repeating the same stuff we've all seen time and time again. If you've watched Family Guy, you've seen Sausage Party. If you've watched Eating Raoul, you've seen Sausage Party. If you've ever read the diary of a nerdy junior high school boy, you've seen Sausage Party. I will concede that it had one or two genuinely hilarious moments, but these were so few and far between that it simply wasn't worth the time. I'm not the biggest fan of low-brow humour, but if they had at least been more creative with it I would have rated this piece of garbage much higher. There were also some bizarre atheist undertones that I'd rather have not had shoved at me. I didn't go to a comedy film to get a lecture on religion or lack thereof. At least animated films like Fritz the Cat were creative and witty when it came to satire, instead of just blatantly rubbing it in viewers' faces. I am completely shocked that Sausage Party has a current 7/10 overall rating on here. I find that fact itself to be more laughable than the film.",/review/rw3561941/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2016,DarkVulcan29,8," It's like a Disney film on acid
","I knew what to expect going in to this, coming from the insane minds of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. I saw the trailer, and thought to myself this is gonna be one insane ride. When I came out of The Secret Life of Pets with my mom and my nephew, saw the poster to Sausage Party, I told my mom ""Don't be fooled by the poster, that is not a kids movie"".",/review/rw3561941/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2016,BeatleNumber9,8," More clever than it has any right to be.
","I honestly didn't think I'd like this movie nearly as much as I actually do. I went in essentially expecting a typical Seth Rogan comedy, just random jokes and nothing else. But the rumors were true, it actually is more clever than it has any right to be.",/review/rw3561941/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2016,tomgillespie2002,6," The fact that this film was greenlit is a cause for celebration
","Sausage Party, the latest button-pusher from Seth Rogen and his usual crew, has so far grossed $135 million on a $19 million budget, receiving mainly positive reviews from critics and assisted by strong word-of-mouth thanks to a climactic scene which won't allow you to look at a hot dog in quite the same way again. Essentially a movie about anthropomorphic, sexually repressed food items who long to escape the confines of their supermarket home to reach the 'Great Beyond' - taken home by us humans - Sausage Party is a mixed bag. On one hand, it's a bold religious parable featuring some extremely creative animation, but on the other, at least comedy wise, this is on par with some of Rogen's most mediocre output.",/review/rw3561941/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2016,Irishchatter,1," Should've trusted my instincts and avoided watching this movie altogether!
","I had a bad feeling of this movie and like I should've kept away from it altogether but I seen that it was uploaded on Putlocker, so I might as well look at it just to see how if I'm proved wrong that its a bad movie. Oh boy, it was a bad movie!",/review/rw3561941/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2020,Kirpianuscus,," vulgar
","A sort of hunting against all taboos. Against religion, using a sort of love story, about humankind, reflecting, in absurde manner, consumerism, giving an obscene pre-end and an absurde end. Just vulgar, in many senses. Because its level is not more high than a dirty joke in a high school rest room. So, a pure dessapointment.",/review/rw3561941/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2018,paulclaassen,1," I absolutely hated this.
","Be careful telling your kids all animated films are ok to watch. This is strictly adults only and even then, not for the faint-hearted it seems! Completely and utterly stupid and inappropriate. Whoever came up with a demented idea like this? If you made it past the logline and actually started watching the film, good luck seeing it through to the end.

10 August 2016,autisticreviewers,10," Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.
","What I loved about it was it's concept that can be only described as Toy Story meets Foodfight, where various food products and items live in a cartoonish world of gods, destiny, foul language and adultery. This is indeed a possible contender for Golden Globe nominations and if possible Academy Award nominations, especially for Best Animated Film (that's if Pixar can stand aside).",/review/rw3561941/?ref_=tt_urv

12 August 2016,Quinoa1984,8," a full course meal of a very dangerous comedy!
","Some of you may be too young to remember (or maybe too old, who knows), but once upon a time a man named Ralph Bakshi made hard-R rated animation that was decidedly not meant for simply for families to gobble up, so at the same time Disney put out something like Robin Hood, he had Heavy Traffic, which was an semi-autobiographical, ""X-rated"" look at life in Brooklyn with all the rough edges showing, or in 1975 (his masterpiece to me) Coonskin, which took off from Song of the South to make a scathing satire on race using black caricatures, blaxploitation and other characters like a naked woman with red-white-and-blue body paint. But of course times have changed and now animation is practically never even made much less released at a wide scale (when was the last time, South Park, maybe, or by extension Team America). So, with this in mind, and ironic to say given the subject matter, but thank God for Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg for Sausage Party.",/review/rw3561941/?ref_=tt_urv

27 April 2020,masonsaul,9," Incredible animated comedy
","Sausage Party is an incredible animated comedy that doesn't waste it's amazing premise. It's outrageous and also has a surprisingly smart message. Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Michael Cera and Nick Croll are all great. Salma Hayek, David Krumholtz and Edward Norton are all really good and Bill Hader is a perfect scene stealer. It's really funny throughout even if a few jokes aren't funny. The animation is really good and the direction by Conrad Vernon and Greg Tiernan is excellent. It's well paced and the music by Alan Menken and Christopher Lennertz is good.",/review/rw3561941/?ref_=tt_urv

22 August 2016,polariskunn2003,1," Food Fight was better...that's how bad it was.
","Here's the thing about propaganda films. If they are bad when Christians do it (God's Not Dead 1&2, Kirk Cameron Saves Christmas) they are not going to be better when atheists do it. That's what it felt like watching this movie. Sausage Party is the God's Not Dead of an atheist propaganda movie. You are preached at for the entire run time on why it's bad to believe in a religion, while having to sit through painfully obvious jokes that don't land. (Oh the douche is a douche. Hahaha creative) Now before I'm accused of being some whack job fundamentalist let me say that I hate the other propaganda films. If I want to watch propaganda I'll go to the source and watch it. Sausage party is even worse because the trailer doesn't show how preachy it actually is.",/review/rw3561941/?ref_=tt_urv

18 May 2019,mitsubishizero,9," I loved every minute of it!
","It's crass, offensive and wild and I loved it for that. To say the characters are a trip is an understatement. You can tell the cast had fun with their roles. Everyone brings in their A-game. It's so shockingly funny you'll be rolling on the floor from laughter while also gasping. It also surprisingly has some good commentary about beliefs and fate when you think about it. Seth Rohan created another great comedy! Check it out for yourself.",/review/rw3561941/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2016,scoobydoo-29055,1," Absolute worst comedy in history
",First off anyone giving this piece of crap a 10 needs a psychiatrist. I love comedy. American pie series is my favorites. This is a complete flop. We all know these idiots on here giving it a 10 are just trying to get you to pay to see it or buy the DVD. Do not buy it. I sat through this waiting for it to end. A stoned person would not find this funny. Talking food that swears? If there was no swearing in this movie there wouldn't be a script or a movie. 100% horrible flick. Not 1 single funny part in it. I went to the bar inside the theater and had a drink and asked what did I miss. I was told nothing. No one laughed once. I promise there won't be a part 2. I laughed when it ended because I was so happy to leave.,/review/rw3561941/?ref_=tt_urv
