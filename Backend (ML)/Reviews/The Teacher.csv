","Below Her Mouth isn't the best movie ever written, it's not original or well-thought out, but it has a lot of good points. ",/review/rw5125194/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2019,wingram-98658,8," Very explicit, however not unnecessarily...
","I have read a lot of the reviews, and although I agree, somewhat, I still liked this movie very much. In my opinion, the acting was raw, but it fit the storyline perfectly. Erika was making her first movie, so she wasn't Meryl Streep, but that was what I liked so much. It felt like you were watching the real deal. Sometimes nervous, sometimes imperfect, a little awkward, not always saying the right things in the ""perfect tone"". But, the chemistry and the emotion all seemed so believable and real. Both actresses conveyed their emotions wonderfully. I was completely mesmerized by how well they were together. Yes, the sex scenes were explicit, but they were not just thrown in there to sell the movie. The scenes were realistic, emotional, and necessary to show the incredible connection they were building. No spoilers...the only complaint I have is the same as others...the ending could have been explored a little more. I would watch a sequel to find out more!",/review/rw5125194/?ref_=tt_urv

","Erotic, sexy and and a lot of nudity. Almost all female cast and crew did a good job, but, the film not something to remember.

14 February 2019,lcrosby-95310,9," Beautiful
","I really enjoyed this film for the way it made me feel. I know this storyline could easily be cliche (as others have said) but I didn't find it so. I liked the way that Dallas pursued Jasmine and jasmine was initially cold. I believed her reactions to the strong advances. I found them realistic. The sex scenes I also thought seemed realistic. It did feel very intimate and genuine...even the way they looked at each other. There was some clumsiness to some of the scenes but that made them seem spontaneous and real to me. Like when Jasmine playfully punched Dallas, it was slightly cringey for me, as was the moment when jasmine ""predictably' asked for Dallas' coming out story. I wanted to know it even though it's likely considered cliche these days. I did feel some mild discomfort over the infidelity issue but they were both beautiful, clever people and the gorgeous hubby would defo have no problem finding a new partner! I liked the way jasmine commented on 'loving her house' it WAS a cool house and like most couples, there's an excitement of finally getting your own place that you'd be fearful of losing so I could understand that. I was also Glad I was able to watch this alone!",/review/rw5125194/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2019,shevaunhodge,10," Good sex scenes
","Ok so reading the reviews I started to question myself, but I Actually really liked this film. Yes,as stated below the main character Dallas is probably ""Shane"" from the L word and to be honest I didn't get why she would be able to get all these straight hot women like jasmine to sleep with her. I did find it weird that she wore a strap on a lot. I have never met Lesbian that does this. The script isn't the best, but I thought the sex scenes were really hot and the story line did intrigue me, but I'm easily pleased some would say . Maybe I don't know enough about films to write a ""proper review""but I liked it.",/review/rw5125194/?ref_=tt_urv

13 August 2017,Moviegoer19,6," Raised Questions
","As a straight woman I've wondered what the appeal is in a woman who acts like a man? The answer would seem to be that hopefully the more positive qualities that women often have, e.g., sensitivity, awareness of another's feelings, willingness to talk and discuss, would still be there despite the more masculine appearance and personality. In this film, I questioned what was it that attracted Jasmine to Dallas and the answer kept being that Dallas treated her like a princess. Jasmine appeared to ""love"" Dallas because of Dallas's seeming worship of her. That, and perhaps the greater knowledge of how to treat a woman sexually that lesbians tend to have. So ultimately this was a film about two self-centered characters getting off on each other's ability to feed their respective egos. ",/review/rw5125194/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2017,Northpole49,7," Refreshing
","I enjoyed this movie despite the rather bland performance of Erika Linder. Taking into account this was her first film, I can give her break in that regard especially since she performed so well in the lovemaking scenes(Not much talking there,I suppose). But the true show -stealer was Natalie Krill. She was very convincing in her portrayal of a woman fighting her feelings and desires for another woman while engaged to a man but losing the battle bit by bit. A very beautiful and versatile actress is Natalie and one that I will look forward to seeing more of. The movie itself could've been better I believe had there been more effort given in portraying Dallas as a protagonist. Part of me wanted to see her fall in love and find happiness while another part didn't think she truly deserved it because of her insensitivity.Very much like Shane McCutcheon as the previous reviewer stated.",/review/rw5125194/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2017,thedisco,1," A real pile of garbage
","I originally gave this movie 3 stars but after further consideration downgraded to a 1. This film is so bad it deserves a review. The film centers around a total douche bag lesbian (Dallas) who, without any charm, character, or color, manages to seduce a snobby shallow strait girl (Jasmin) who is engaged to a man (Who we never really get a chance to know because he has only a handful of lines in the film).",/review/rw5125194/?ref_=tt_urv

8 April 2018,jamesdtabor,9," Sensitive, Honest, Intimate, Sexual
","Those who watch this film for a bit of ""soft porn"" miss the point. The nude scenes of lovemaking are amazingly well done, moving, and strikingly realistic. They capture the kind of ""madly, badly"" in love passion that those fortunate enough to have experience in life will appreciate. Likewise, anyone seeing this as a ""Lesbian"" film, also misses the point, though that is an important part of the story line--with Natalie Krill's character coming out and cautiously and painfully discovering her sexuality. But more than sex, or lesbianism, or any other social commentary this is a film about how two people can fall madly and suddenly in love for reasons the heart and body only know. I think this is one of the finest films covering these complex and difficult themes I have ever seen. The photography is stunning.",/review/rw5125194/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2017,a666333,2," soft porn clichés, rename to ""Below her Navel""
","Don't have any doubts, this is an amateur(ish) soft porn film that is vainly trying to sell itself as something meaningful. Unfortunately, it doesn't even succeed well as soft core porn as it amounts to one tired cliché after another and is not even sexy. The clichés are in every scene setup, every character and every line of dialogue. You know the ultimate role and fate of every character within seconds of their introduction. There is not even the smallest surprise or suspense in anything. And certainly you have seen everything here before and done much better. ",/review/rw5125194/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2017,annuskavdpol,6," A Canadian movie!
","This movie is very graphic. It is about a very passionate and honest lesbian who breaks up with her long-term relationship because she believes she is toxic to her because she does not love her the way the other loves her. In a way this is both cruel and honest. It is not very accommodating to the feelings of the girlfriend, who shows signs of disgust, hurt and utter alienation. This break-up scene which sets the stage for the whole movie is significant. Lesbian movies often do not make the big screen theaters, so this one slipped through the cracks, in my opinion. In a way, Dallas, the lead female actress, is a very cold and calculated person. How could you be living with someone and treat them so callously in the end of the long-term relationship? In a way, Dallas is like a sexual predator. Within, what seems like minutes and seconds, she goes to nightclubs to scope out her next victim in the lesbian bars and nightclubs. She has no remorse, empathy nor compassion for the feelings of her ex. Instead she jumps on the saddle, makes a move with the bar-tender (who her best-friend indicated that she really liked herself for a couple of months already) and then kisses and makes out with the neighbor of her Roofing construction work site. It is the contention, that Dallas finds love in the end. But the story development surrounding the theme of love in relationships is not fully explored through the cinematic camera shots. Broken Back Mountain, a movie about two men who create a bond with each other, is a far more in depth character study of two individuals who really care a lot about each other. To me, Broke Back Mountain is a way better portrayal of the theme of universal love. This is a Canadian movie versus a Hollywood movie. And the genre of other love is still new to the silver screen. This is a good attempt into this genre. It is similar in style to the Canadian movie, Exotica.",/review/rw5125194/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2017,pik923,1," Horrible
","Bad enough men exploit women in films this is women exploiting women in a soft porn horrible film with no redeeming features except most of the actors are lovely to look at. Really girls give it a break huffing and puffing and all this stuff with a stupid storyline terrible script worse acting, drinking drinking more drinking, and a lot of heavy breathing and stupid penetrating sex. I'm just really amazed at how bad this was and I'm sure men will get off on it as well as some women but time to make decent films about women loving women. Get some education read some classics make it interesting, dazzle us with good solid filmmaking. This film is an insult and so predictable - booorrrinnnngggg",/review/rw5125194/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2020,lucymull,7," Underrated
","I really enjoyed this film and would definitely recommend it.
In places it did seem a bit derivative, as does any romance film, but that didn't spoil my viewing. Despite what I've read in many of the other reviews, I personally liked the acting and dialogue. I think the chemistry between Dallas and Jasmine was clear from the start. The love between them actually made me cry at times. It was really refreshing to see sexuality portrayed on screen as something that is not black and white, and to see an androgynous main character.
My only complaints are the beginning and the end. I think the affair escalated too quickly, with Jasmine's guilt seemingly disappearing in an instant, never to be mentioned again until she was caught in the act. And I think the ending jumped too quickly to happy ever after with no transitional period shown on screen. However, I can excuse the rushed start to the film as being due to time constraints or as a sign of the passion between the two main characters, and it was nice to see things end well for Jasmine and Dallas.
I would definitely watch this film again.",/review/rw5125194/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2017,nogodnomasters,6," I Kissed a Girl
","The film is a lesbian drama that centers on Dallas (Erika Linder) a Swedish roofer working in San Francisco (or some other North American city with a trolley car). She is built like a model, but acts rough. We see her initially being disagreeable and breaking up with Joshlyn (Mayko Nguyen) and shortly thereafter hooking up with Jasmine (Natalie Krill) a woman who is engaged to a hunk who is financially sound. Dallas is a wreaking ball when it comes to relationships and she know it. She works for ""Above your head specialists"" which is a sort of pun on the title or the title is a pun of her company's by-line.",/review/rw5125194/?ref_=tt_urv

","As a lesbian in her mid-forties I have seen many lesbian films of the past several decades, and after seeing the trailer I was not about to miss this one. I almost wish I had passed, but this movie is so laughably awful, it has to be seen to be believed. The 'acting' is so terrible that I literally was laughing out loud at some parts. Several friends and I watched this together, and we all agreed that this movie ranks as one of the all time worst.",/review/rw5125194/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2019,pipschandra,10," Accurate Representation of Androgynous Lesbian's Lifestyle
","As an androgynous lesbian, it is safe to say this was an extremely accurate movie and I wish there were more movies like this. Best lesbian movie I've seen by far. From personal experience this is exactly how androgynous lesbians meet women. Straight women or Bi-curious women are usually attracted to androgynous folk. The timeline of the movie is over one weekend, that's usually how fast these flings start and end. Movie has a cheesy (unrealistic) ending because a woman never wins in real life - sad truth is that men always win over androgynous folk in real life. Overall, this was an accurate representation of my lifestyle, which was reassuring and exciting because I've never seen people like me on the big screen have a lead role and win the girl. I'd give it 11 stars because someone like me was finally represented in entertainment in a positive light. 😊 wish more people supported this movie!!",/review/rw5125194/?ref_=tt_urv
