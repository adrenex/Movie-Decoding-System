15 October 2022,DasGlasperlenspiel,10," Brilliant and relevant
","The theme of the series is the music industry's fight for survival and the rise of the streaming platform Spotify. To keep the series exciting, each episode is told from the perspective of a different participant. In this way, a really complex topic is not reduced to a simple scheme of good and evil. Otherwise, the transformation of an 'IT nerd' into a 'tech billionaire' might not have been a storyline for six episodes and 4,5 hours screentime. But now this mini series is really brilliant and a really outstanding implementation of a current topic, namely how the digital revolution is changing all of our lives. Excellent!",/review/rw8608870/?ref_=tt_urv

","To be honest, I was sceptical when I started watching. 'How can they make a 6 part series about Spotify interesting?' I thought. Then I ended up binge-watching the whole thing!",/review/rw8608870/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,jonasies,4," Skip the last episode
",I thought the show was really good.... up until the last episode. The actor playing Daniel Eks side-kick Martin Lorentzon did an amazing job. Basically carried the whole show.,/review/rw8608870/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2022,paul-allaer,7," Solid mini-series, highlighted by Episode 6
","As Episode 1 of ""The Playlist"" (2022 release from Sweden; 6 episodes of 45-55 min each) opens, we are in ""Ragsved, 2004"" (a suburb of Stockholm) and we get to know Daniel Ek, a 22 yo who had hoped to land a job at Google, but alas, he was rejected. He starts his own company, Advertigo, providing digital discount coupons. It's not long before that this new venture attracts the attention of others... At this point we are 10 minutes into Episode 1.",/review/rw8608870/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2022,janko-bosch,7," Ruined by the last episode
",This series would be great but the last episode is a let down. Otherwise I would simply had rated it a 9. The story tells the origin of Spotify and then suddenly turns to a sci-fi pic.,/review/rw8608870/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2022,fedeperoni-97228,6," Great until the last episode
","Starts out great, but this has to be the worst last episode of a mini series ever made. Really, the dialogue is so cringe and stupid that my whole experience suffered dramatically.",/review/rw8608870/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2022,folk_egm,8," The most creative Spotify birth series with 6 stories, 6 Rashomon views!
","The story of Spotify's breaking through the toughest obstacles, the music streaming that changed the world from 2008 to today. But this is not a glamorous story. But full of emotional pressure, serious, along with the problem of Gen, people working in the music business who refuse to change themselves. Despite being hit by pirate Bay Web bits, raging until the music industry is almost unable to survive. All the characters have their own good-looking Rashomon-style narrative. But when the other person told him, he became a villain in the eyes of others. It's a story that overlaps one another in gray. Let the audience decide for themselves what is true or not. All 6 episodes have completely different moods and themes. But still able to tell the story continuously from the beginning to the future of Spotify in a harmonious way. And even if you're not a music listener or use Spotify, you can still enjoy this story.",/review/rw8608870/?ref_=tt_urv

13 October 2022,VeekeyBharti,9," SPOT - ON
","A nice take on the origins of streaming site Spotify. Tight script, wonderful execution, well balanced approach and perfect star cast. It doesn't exactly say how much is truth and how much is fictionalized to spice it up or bland it down, but give n take, this is a well done limited series in recent past.",/review/rw8608870/?ref_=tt_urv

","It starts slow with almost to much comedic touch, so you have to be a little patient, but than it turns serious and darkish!",/review/rw8608870/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,DADE121,9," 2 episodes in! Very hooked, This is what I expect to see as a mini series!
","I had no idea about it and went in blind. This surprised me. The acting, the cinematography and the flow of the story is authentic and genuine. I do not know if this is completely true to the reality story, but it is very hooking for sure. Episode 2 was epic, the acting and the conflict between cultures, portrayed genuinely. ""Heisenberg"" looking guy won me over!",/review/rw8608870/?ref_=tt_urv

1 November 2022,SkepticalSy,7," It's good
","I like how this series takes multiple perspectives to show us the rise and controversy of Spotify, and what issues were plaguing the record industry at the time. It's certainly worth the watch, especially if you like stories about start-ups.",/review/rw8608870/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2022,kamal_ua,8," Watch it, but skip the last episode!
","Pleasantly surprised by the show, binged the whole show in a day, though I wish I forgot the last episode. The last episode literally added to value to the this mini series in my opinion, it felt like a bit of and afterthought.",/review/rw8608870/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2022,sandisunshine-91829,5," Too political.
",I love tech start up shows but this one was too political for me. Projecting out into the future is where it lost me. No where in the description does it say it is sci-fi haha. By all accounts I should have loved it as I prefer foreign movies and love tech start up shows. Don't get me wrong it was entertaining for sure but by the end was such a stretch into future prediction territory I didn't quite know what to make of it. It felt like it had a very strong agenda and I prefer not to watch shows that try to brainwash me. Not saying I disagree with the political platform but I prefer to make my own decisions.,/review/rw8608870/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,pal-gandharv,8," A must watch for techies
","There might be 1000s of startups with different path-breaking ideas and invincible revenue models but SPOTIFY during its initial days was more about its splendid team and failed attempts to get music rights. This limited web-series wonderfully displays SPOTIFY's journey with all its aspects through its core team members' journeys on screen. I really liked the categorization of episodes. As I belong to the software industry, I liked the Coder episode the most. Even the lawyer's journey was stunningly beautiful. The swagger Daniel Ek carried throughout the series was worth noticing and honestly, he outperformed all other characters by miles. It's not just Spotify's journey but it also called forth the struggle of music artists and singers behind this giant music instant streaming company. So it's not about all the positive impacts Spotify has left on its users but also about its impingement of the artists values and their remuneration. The court drama was bang on in the last episode. It's not all technical, so it is for all. A good web-series for professionals like MBA graduates, lawyers, techies, etc. A special mention for the background music which had to be top-notch for obvious reasons.",/review/rw8608870/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,Skarsgard24,10," Fantastic!
","I wish there was more! Great acting and production. Sweden really knows how to make a great mini-series. They somehow made a background story of Spotify interesting. They focus on a different person in the story each episode and they lead perfectly into each other. I loved going back and reliving history with inside details and fun twists. It is in Swedish but it has subtitles and there are large portions of it in English due to meetings in New York, LA, etc. All in all, it is a cant miss mini series and I highly recommend. 10/10 & I'm starting to think it's my favorite show of the year so far. Det är jättebra!",/review/rw8608870/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2022,testbed,1," A riches to riches story of how an arrogant millionaire became an arrogant billionaire
","It's tricky to know who to root for, and the first episode will leave you thinking ""I hope he doesn't make it, he's an arrogant rich man-child"". We of course already know that he makes it and I almost turned it off until the reviews on imdb convicned me to stick around.",/review/rw8608870/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2022,ar_brierley,9," Awesome!! The Swedes got this SOOO right!!
","This is another awesome series by Netflix!! Right up there with The So I'll Network! Really 'lifts the lid' on how Spotify, & probably other streaming services too) screw over the artists, most of who only get about $12 a month for their music streamed on the platform. No wonder Taylor Swift removed her music from there for a few years; but eventually went back, that's why monopolies are bad for the masses, good for only a few at the top. The early episodes are great, and show the founding of the company and the innovation and initiative shown by Daniel Ek. But once the company becomes mega successful & he's a multi billionaire, they become tyrants & have to ""feed the beast"" of profit-at-all-costs to keep investors & shareholders happy. Just like Facebook, Google, etc. Such a sad world of corporate greed these days 😞",/review/rw8608870/?ref_=tt_urv
