","Greetings again from the darkness. Ahmir ""Questlove"" Thompson's directorial debut is a history lesson wrapped in a concert film, and it's just the blended spoonful we need. You might know Questlove best as the bandleader/drummer on ""The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon"", and with this documentary, he has proven his skill in balancing the visuals with the message. The Harlem Cultural Festival was held over six weekends in the summer of 1969. Yep, the same summer as (and only 100 miles from) the infamous and celebrated Woodstock festival. A total of 300,000 people attended the free events held in Mt Morris Park in Harlem, and Questlove's film brings back what has been forgotten.",/review/rw7707427/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm not generally a fan of concert films, and ""Summer of Soul"" did go on a bit longer than I had patience for, but of films like it it's a great example of the genre.",/review/rw7707427/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2021,paul-allaer,10," Best movie of 2021, period
","""Summer of Soul (... Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised)"" (2021 release; 117 min.) is a documentary about the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival which took place over 6 weekends from late June through late August and thus at the same time as Woodstock, hence the nickname the ""Black Woodstock"" for the Harlem Cultural Festival. Even though these events were taped, the tapes have been sitting in a basement collecting dust for 50 years, until the Roots' Questlove decided to make a film about this. As the documentary opens, we see Stevie Wonder doing a stunning drum solo, yes a DRUM SOLO, as the crowd goes wild. The Chamber Brothers come next and blow us out of the water with their ""Uptown"" song. Along the way, we are reminded of the tremendous social changes that were taking place in those years. At this point we are 10 min. Into the documentary.",/review/rw7707427/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2021,matthewssilverhammer,8," A transcendent gift
","Beautifully restored lost footage of one of the coolest music festivals ever, which serendipitously took place in 1969, a pivotal year in American history. Questlove brings his music mastery (particularly in his DJ-ing and drumming) to the documentary editing table. It's an impressive amount of cinematic style for a man who's admittedly a novice. Simone's performance of Young, Gifted, and Black perfectly captures the power and pureness of this social musical.",/review/rw7707427/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2021,EamonTracyCritic,10," A criminally overlooked Festival gets it's proper due in this compelling documentary
","In his debut documentary using footage that was gathering dust in a basement for over 50 years, Ahmir-Khalib Thompson (aka Questlove) captures a remarkable weekend of music and politics at the Harlem Cultural Festival in July, 1969. Since it was a black concert no white owned media outlet wanted to distribute it and thus it was ignored. Furthermore it's significance was overshadowed by Woodstock and the historical Moon Landing that occurred on the same weekend that summer.",/review/rw7707427/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2021,cliftonofun,8," Time travel for your soul (and heart)
","I did not think time travel was possible, but then I walked into Summer of Soul. I could not have picked a better first post-pandemic theater experience, and I knew it the moment people started applauding at Mavis Staples' appearance. I visited 1969, I visited Harlem, and I had my very own Summer of Soul. Don't miss this one.",/review/rw7707427/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,repete52,10," Genuine stuff! The real thing!
","You can't not like this. It's authentic, genuine; people gathering to have a good time, great bands, people having fun, more than they expected when they went to this Harlem Festival.",/review/rw7707427/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2021,minister_of_silly_walks,10," A Music And History Lesson With An Awesome Soundtrack
","Just an incredible documentary covering the Harlem Music Festival from 1969 with some great performances from some of the most famous jazz, soul, blues and gospel performers from the 60's. It uses never before seen archive footage with interviews of the musicians and attendees giving the documentary a raw and authentic feel transporting the viewer into a turbulent era marked by the Civil Rights Movement and some of the most legendary and everlasting music ever created.",/review/rw7707427/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2021,boblipton,8," Still Not Televisable In This Form
","1968 was a tough year for New York City, what with the garbage strike and the Harlem Riots (which killed more people than the riot about whether it was acceptable to wear a straw boater after September 15, and almost as many as the one about who was the best Shakespearean actor in town). In 1969, New York's best looking (and possibly worst performing, unless you count the one who went around in his wife's clothes) mayor agreed that a music festival in Harlem was preferable, so the City (and Maxwell House) bankrolled a series of four weekend concerts in Harlem. They even filmed it.",/review/rw7707427/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2021,mmbruns,10," Great film
",I hope this movie inspires someone to put out a DVD set (or streaming) of performances from this festival. The performance clips we get are generally fantastic (do wonder if that was the only BB King tape surviving because his clip is a bit of a mess). Overall I think the interviews and historical context descriptions give great insight into the period and circumstances of the festival which deepen the film.,/review/rw7707427/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2021,valleyjohn,7," Great footage but the film lacked structure.

","Having grown up during the time this was filmed, I can truly identify with the music and mood of the country at that time. Take the time to really listen and watch this movie. The performances tell you so much about how the music touched people in a positive way. One of my favorite documentaries of all time.",/review/rw7707427/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2022,lee_eisenberg,10," the revolution will not be televised, and the summer of 1969 will not get repeated
","We've all heard of Woodstock. What you might not know is that at the same time, there was a soul music festival in Harlem. It featured just about every soul and Motown singer of the era. Questlove's Academy Award-nominated ""Summer of Soul (...Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised)"" features footage of the festival, noting the political climate in which it took place due to the Vietnam War and racial tensions.",/review/rw7707427/?ref_=tt_urv

2 May 2022,ace-150,10," Worth The Hype
","Unlike Woodstock and Monterey Pop, which are concert films with a little bit of documentary footage, this is a real documentary with a lot of concert footage. Even though it would be entertaining just to watch the concert, the context and analysis are riveting. It puts the music in the midst of everything from assassinations to the moon landing. And calls attention to the many performers who were bringing their talents out of the church setting for the first time, embracing acid rock, and dressing and acting in a way that violated the longstanding rule for black artists of ""don't scare the white people"".",/review/rw7707427/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2021,Johann_Cat,5," Cool Movie, But More Talk than Festival Music
","This could have been a great concert movie, and I am not wholly against the idea of parallel commentary to music. What I have never liked, in clubs, concerts, or films, is people yakking during performances. This film is like going to a club and having a long-winded buddy describe the significance and history of each piece as it plays--in effusive detail. This movie interrupts nearly every performance with retrospective blah-blah. Thus this was a lost opportunity. A typical reaction I had was digging Hugh Masekala beginning to get into a trumpet solo. He plays for about five seconds before the film cuts to ""historical context"" comments. Only a handful of performances are allowed to unfold without over-dubbed comments; a bare subset of those, like Sly Stone's set, are allowed to be played in full. I think this would have been a more meaningful experience if 90% of the performances were allowed to be full length. ""Monterey Pop"" (1967) is one of the great concert movies because it features full-performances, is *music first* and almost zero ""commentary.""",/review/rw7707427/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2022,AndreaWeaver1,10," A must-see
","Wow, wow, wow, wow! I loved this film. What to say... JUST WATCH IT! This is a wonderful picture of an event that would have been unknown to the next generation had it not been for this unearthing. A poignant portrayal of social issues that sadly resonate now, just as much as it did fifty years ago.",/review/rw7707427/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2021,cherold,8," Fascinating story of a forgotten cultural event
",This documentary portrays a series of NYC summer concerts that happened in Harlem the same year as Woodstock. It was all filmed - Stevie Wonder! - Nina Simone! - The Staple Singers! - but there was never the funding to turn it into a Monterey Pop/Woodstock concert movie.,/review/rw7707427/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2021,hstimpson,8," great, but too much yakking
","Terrific music, and the interviews with artists today are often great...BUT the commentary is often intrusive on the music, which speak for itself. With less blab and more music, I would have given it a 10.",/review/rw7707427/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2021,li0904426,10," Beautiful Piece of Black History!!!!
","This documentary reminds us of the prejudice we still have against black people. We hear about Woodstock but never ever have we heard about The Harlem Cultural Festival in 1969. Questlove, the director, is able to comprise and summarize the Black people movement of the 60's with what was happening in the Festival. It is simply a beautiful visual lesson of the Black movement history with amazing soul, gospel, r&b performances in the background.",/review/rw7707427/?ref_=tt_urv
