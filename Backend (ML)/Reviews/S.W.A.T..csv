7 September 2021,planktonrules,10," Excellent but not for all audiences
","A few words of warning about ""Prisoners"" before you try watching it. It's a very intense, violent and disturbing movie to say the least. While it is ranked #190 on IMBD's Top 250, it's NOT a film for everyone. . I mention this just to warn you...to think about this before you watch.",/review/rw2963254/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2014,kosmasp,10," More than just one meaning
","If you think of someone being a prisoner, you automatically might think of someone behind bars. But apart from a physical prison, a prisoner can also be trapped mentally, either by his own doing or by someone else. This movie that starts off pretty light gets very heavy. And it is carried by its actors. Gyllenhalls characters might seem odd and out of place at the beginning, even like a cardboard cutout. But he does have more to do as the movie progresses.",/review/rw2963254/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2017,Hitchcoc,9," Hard to Watch but Really Well Done
","Two very good actors ply their trade very well. Jake Gyllanhaal plays a policeman who is utterly driven in his quest to find two kidnapped little girls. Hugh Jackman plays a survivalist who ""prays for the best but expects the worst."" During Thanksgiving dinner, two little girls go up to a rusty old RV and shortly thereafter, disappear. The prime suspect is a mentally handicapped young man, the driver of the RV. But the girls are nowhere to be found. He is held for 48 hours and then released. It is then that Jackman takes matters into his own hands. He kidnaps the young man and, convinced he knows everything, tortures him and beats him for days. Meanwhile, another suspect arises but Jackman can't handle this and keeps pounding away. There are numerous twists and turns that seem to work well. Gyllanhaal is a troubled guy himself who has some anger issues that he keeps under wraps. I had not heard of this film and it was a treat to view it.",/review/rw2963254/?ref_=tt_urv

",I didn't realize until I came to some of the reviews for this movie that it was two and a half hours long. It didn't seem like that while watching as one gets so engrossed in the story that time manages to fly by pretty quickly.,/review/rw2963254/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2013,YJLcool,8," a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought-provoking crime drama thriller
","Prisoners is a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought-provoking crime drama thriller. The film mainly focus on the choices taken and the consequences faced by the characters when worst things happen to them.",/review/rw2963254/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2013,ClaytonDavis,8," 'Prisoners' is a tightly wound thriller featuring career bests from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal...
","There is a sensitivity that Director Denis Villenueve and writer Aaron Guzikowski inhabit in bringing their newest film ""Prisoners"" from Warner Bros. to the screen. Starring an Academy Award nominated cast that includes Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terence Howard, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Oscar-winner Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano, this is a smartly constructed and emotionally resound mystery thriller that is thoroughly enjoyable.",/review/rw2963254/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2020,Diablo1616,8," One of the most chilling thriller movies I have ever seen.
","""Prisoners"" is rich in compelling narratives and stellar performances from the ensemble cast. This movie had me love and hate Hugh Jackman's character which was so complex to the point of making me question my moral standards because I found myself empathizing with his character. On the other hand, Jake Gyllenhaal did a marvelous job on playing the frustrated cop: complete with all the intensity of his eyes and his intuition. While Gyllenhaal had more screentime as the lead, Jackman's performance really stood out for me.",/review/rw2963254/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2013,gregsrants,8," Jackman Shines in Villeneuve Classic

26 September 2013,FilmMuscle,7," A True (and terrific) Exploration of Moral Ambiguity
","Wow, what an intensely suspenseful film Prisoners was. The film commences with a naturalistic and peaceful look of a suburban neighborhood, leafless trees calmly swaying along with the cool air that encompass them. All is fine, and a perfectly normal family visits their friends/neighbors for a delightful dinner and some music. Everything is fine and dandy until both family's two kids run off to retrieve a toy they left outside. After pleasant conversation, the two families begin to realize that their kids haven't gotten back yet. The noiseless environment around them feels incredibly unusual, and once they realize that their kids have officially gone missing, chaos breaks loose. We are suddenly presented with a ruthless father (played by Hugh Jackman) who loves his daughter so much that he's willing to transcend any morally difficult obstacles to hopefully locate her.

","Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is searching for a child serial killer, and catches Alex Jones (Paul Dano) in an old RV.

Loki has to let Jones loose, but Dover is not letting him go.",/review/rw2963254/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2017,TheLittleSongbird,8," Long in length and high in suspense and tension
","That 'Prisoners' is directed by Denis Villeneuve, has cinematography by Roger Deakins and a music score from Johann Johannsson promised a big deal, having seen 'Sicario' and being blown away by its brilliance, especially in these areas. As did having a cast of talented actors such as Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Viola Davis and Melissa Leo.",/review/rw2963254/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2013,corrosion-2,9," Spellbinding
","Prisoners is extremely suspenseful and equally disturbing. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, whose last film was the equally spellbinding and disturbing Incendies, builds up the tension from the first frame and does not let up for the full 153 minutes of the movie. Aaron Guzikowski's script, though on the surface a child kidnapping thriller, bucks all Hollywood trends and, as well as being a taut thriller, poses serious moral issues. It also helps that the film has a first rate cast doing outstanding work: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Terence Howard, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. Prisoners is not for the faint heated but is likely to feature strongly at next year's Oscars.",/review/rw2963254/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2020,alexcole10,8," First Watched it When I was 13 - Scared me to Death
","This psychological crime thriller is one of the best out there in terms of gripping the audience. I watched it when I was 13 with a friend of mine after his step-dad recommended it. It freaked the hell out of me and left me with nightmares for weeks, simply due to the performances of Paul Dano, as the quiet and shy man-child and David Dastmalchian, as the creepy and slightly eerie red herring.",/review/rw2963254/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2013,Horst_In_Translation,8," A definite contender for best thriller of 2013
","Even if he already worked for over 20 years before that, director Denis Villeneuve rose to fame considerably after giving audiences his 2010 film ""Incendies"", a nominee for the Best Foreign Language Oscar. With ""prisoners"" he directed his very first English-language movie. Two young girls disappear and the film centers on the father (Jackman) of one of them and the cop (Gyllenhaal) investigating what might have happened to them. Jackman, who already gave one of my favorite performances last year with his impressive turn as Jean Valjean, delivers again as a father who does what needs to be done to save his daughter's life and Gyllenhaal, who I've never been that big of a fan, impressed me as well. His portrayal of a loner, in his profession as well as his private life, gave me the chills occasionally and proves that he can pull off characters that go far beyond the pretty boy / nice guy image.",/review/rw2963254/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2018,paulclaassen,9," Hugh Jackman at his very best!!
","The entire cast is absolutely brilliant in their respective roles. Casting was perfectly done. This is the most serious I've ever seen Hugh Jackman and he does it so incredibly well that I hade goosebumps more often than not. From the plot to the execution thereof was brilliantly done to bring us an unforgettable, thrilling masterpiece. Be warned, though, as the film is quite disturbing at times.",/review/rw2963254/?ref_=tt_urv

","There is a scene in ""On Dangerous Ground"" (1951) in which half-crazy detective Robert Ryan is about to beat the living crap out of a suspect to gain information. Ryan's features twist into a pustule of hate, hardly human. ""Why do you DO it? Why do you punks make me DO it?"" And then he goes frantically to work.",/review/rw2963254/?ref_=tt_urv

6 September 2013,will-vanduzer,9," Hugh Jackman's finest role?
","Hugh Jackman takes you on a trip through the intense emotions a family is put through during its darkest hour. This may be his best role to date. From the trailers you know that his character will be out for blood as their daughter was kidnapped, but throughout the film you feel his pain, anger and moral struggles as he deals with this situation. The director does an excellent job of keeping you invested in the film emotionally even through some intensely violent scenes. Its dreary setting provides no comfort, but goes hand and hand with the narrative. This film may not be for those faint of heart but should be a must see for most viewers.",/review/rw2963254/?ref_=tt_urv

Anna and Joy want to play on the street and Ralph stays with them. The girls play in a ROV and Ralph brings them back home.

17 November 2013,bob the moo,," Dark and morally murky even if it doesn't have the courage of its convictions
","In the space of a few days both the male stars of this film were so heavily into promoting it that they both appeared on the Daily Show on different nights. This suggested that the film must be struggling either because of quality or because it is a hard sell – and it certainly seemed that the latter was most likely to be the reason for the sales push. The plot sees two young girls go missing on thanksgiving in a small rural town; a suspect is found and while the police try to figure it all out, the emotional impact on the two families starts to take its toll.",/review/rw2963254/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2017,zkonedog,10," One Of The Most Viscerally Intense Films Ever Made
","After viewing ""Prisoners"" opening night in the theater, I turned to my companions during the closing credits and said ""I feel like I've just been through a ten round prize fight"". It had been a long time since I'd seen a movie that battered my emotions quite as much as this one. Seven years later, upon a recent re-watch, my emotions are about the same. This is about as viscerally intense of a film as one will ever watch.",/review/rw2963254/?ref_=tt_urv
