6 December 2022,bbickley13-921-58664,8," An excellent portrait
","Though the movie focus on a man whose gay and his experience going through the Marines Boot Camp, the movie actually examines a diverse group of young men going through the Marine Corps training. Of all the types you'll find your type that you can relate to.",/review/rw8737952/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2022,naq-1,8," Terrific Exploration of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell""
","The policy of ""Don't Ask..."" was in effect when the movie was conceived -- and it serves as a time capsule of the ramification of that policy. In the event that a gay man is able to become a member of the armed forces, he has to contend with any number of abuses that are heaped up upon him in the name of discrimination. In the case of this film, it is doubled as the lead character is not only gay, but also black.",/review/rw8737952/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,jimfinger-47793,8," Worthwhile, particularly as a study in overcoming parental disavowal.
","The understated nature of this film is, overall, an asset, though at the same time, it undermines the clarity and impact of the overall story. Still, this is a clear eyed look at the trauma that a parent's disapproval can wreak, and the courage and determination of the protagonist to find an accepting ""family"" is both admirable and inspirational. Very fine, believable performances from all the cast, and the script never strikes any false or sentimentally objectionable notes. The crisp, ninety or so minute length is also a wise decision, the story doesn't need any more than that to be told convincingly. Good (if not brilliant) job!",/review/rw8737952/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2022,brentsbulletinboard,8," An Outstanding Directorial Debut
","Finding one's family may not always occur where one most likely expects it. For many of us, that typically comes with our blood relations. But sometimes circumstances arise that prevent that from happening, as is the case for a twentysomething gay Black man (Jeremy Pope) who has been on his own since age 16 when his close-minded single mother (Gabrielle Union) forced him out onto the streets to fend for himself. And, after years of bouncing around aimlessly, he decides to try getting his act together by joining the Marines, a seemingly unlikely choice but one that unwittingly helps him find what he's been looking for all along. Writer-director Elegance Bratton's fact-based debut narrative feature tells a compelling story of acceptance among those from whom it might least be expected and its absence where one would think it should most likely be present. The film's superb Independent Spirit Award-nominated performances by Pope and Union, along with fine supporting portrayals turned in by other members of the excellent ensemble cast (most notably Bokeem Woodbine and Ra√∫l Castillo), truly give this picture its razor-sharp edge and its touching moments of heartfelt compassion, an unusual mix of elements on the same story, to be sure. In several regards, ""The Inspection"" also echoes groundbreaking themes first addressed in ""Moonlight"" (2016), though with slightly different but nevertheless equal significance. Admittedly, the production could probably benefit from a little more back story development and slightly brisker pacing in the first half-hour, but those are truly minor shortcomings in the greater scheme of things where this film is concerned. If this ISA candidate for best first feature is any indication of what we can expect in future works from this filmmaker, I can't wait to see what else he comes up with.",/review/rw8737952/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2023,fraser-simons,8," A very competent debut
","With a mom like that who needs enemies. This works quite well on many levels. Maybe it'll clue some people into why queer people found families are more functional than the blood relations that can't see past their own fear and hatred. Externalized, embodied, by the military in many ways, this simple story of a black gay man with no one endeavouring to be a marine is an excellent debut.",/review/rw8737952/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2022,chong_an,7," A workman-like view of Marine boot camp for a gay participant
","Kicked out of home at age 16 by his single mother, likely because she found out he was gay, a black man eventually decided to turn his life around by joining the Marines, during the time of the Afghanistan War. This is mostly a docudrama about his time in boot camp. While he answered ""no"" to the question of ""Are you a homosexual"", shouted at all recruits early on (plus others like ""Have you smoked marijuana, etc.), presumably his physical reaction to being in a shared-shower situation gave away his secret. In his continuing journey, he has both detractors and allies.",/review/rw8737952/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2022,nikicianciola-702-657633,2," Horrible Movie
","I heard Elegance Bratton's interview on NPR and it was very good. I was intrigued by his story and saw the movie two weeks later. What I thought was a slow start turned into a series of bad acting, no character development, and awful scenes reminiscent of low-budget porn storylines. The homosexual stereotypes were over the top and were shameful and a disservice to all whom serve in the military.",/review/rw8737952/?ref_=tt_urv
