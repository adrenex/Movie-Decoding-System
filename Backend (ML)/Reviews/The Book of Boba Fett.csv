11 October 2018,cricketbat,8," What a crime thriller should be
","I like it when a movie can keep me guessing until the end, and Gone Girl just did that. Most of the time I didn't know where this film was going, and each new twist and turn was a surprise. You can't help but get pulled into the story. The actors all gave excellent performances, as well. I don't think I'll ever be able to look at some of them the same way again. This movie is what a crime thriller should be.",/review/rw3097383/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2020,cmalpelli,9," Mixed feelings, hear me out.
","There's no denying that this is a great film and from what I've heard a great book as well, you can see that I gave it a 9/10 rating, but there's a catch especially for me personally with this movie. The shorts version I can tell you and with my hand to God no lie this movie single handedly put the nail in the coffin for my marriage without me even being the wiser. So for as much as I do appreciate the detailed and intriguing story, watching it years later after my divorce it sends chills through my body knowing that my ex wife and I enjoyed this movie together, and obviously me not knowing just how much she loved it but how it inspired her to go about divorcing me in the way that she did, be weary because there are sick people (men and women) in this world that will vindictively assassinate someone else's character and well being just to avenge whatever perversion that they're transfixed on in their own mind. I'm not looking for sympathy or anything, I'm just stating a fact that happened to me, I don't advise watching this for the first time with a love partner, it could unhinge the mind beyond a point of no return, I'm absolutely 100% serious about this, this is not a joke.",/review/rw3097383/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wow, actually a thriller that's pretty good. Yes, it's fair to say that 'Gone Girl' is a really engrossing film. As with almost every film, it's based on a book. And, as with most films based on a book, I haven't read the book, so I haven't got a clue how well the film relates to the source material. But then I don't care.

",This is a 2.5 hour movie and sometimes these days it's difficult for me to stick with the longer movies but this never felt long. You were always curious what was going on. Let's just say it didn't quite go the way I expected but I was intrigued the whole time. The acting was great. This could for sure be considered a slow burn and I'm actually currently watching the TV show Sharp Objects by the same author and this is paced much better than that.

","I have always been a huge admirer of David Fincher. He is undoubtedly one of the most consistent and masterful storytellers in modern cinema. I also think when it comes to dark, disturbing thrillers, there is very few who can match the directorial skills of Fincher. ",/review/rw3097383/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2014,TheLittleSongbird,9," Another David Fincher winner and one of the year's best
","David Fincher to me is one of the most talented directors around today, and while Se7en from personal opinion is his best film Gone Girl is up there with his best. Fincher directs with his usual superb class, giving the film great style and keeping the story alive(Gone Girl is easily one of the year's best directed films), and the whole film looks absolutely great with brooding lighting that evokes the creepy atmosphere brilliantly and Gone Girl is also a film that makes good use of digital, after seeing many directors over-using or cheapening it it was refreshing to see the technique done with taste. Trent Rezner and Atticus Ross's music score gives the film a haunting vibe and adds much to the unsettling intensity that a lot of the film(at least two-thirds worth), managing to not do it in an in-your-face manner. The use of sound mixing was interesting and came off cleverly, almost like a distant thought process. Gone Girl also has a brilliantly written and adapted script that does a great job balancing dark humour- that's not overused and is often hilarious- and suspense mystery (The Cool Girl monologue in particular is a masterpiece of script-writing, one of my favourite film monologues ever), while the story(apart from taking a bit of time to get starting) is absorbing from start to finish, rich in detail and characterisation and is filled with shocks and unpredictable twists that will be guaranteed to leave you reeling. That it is adapted from superb source material(one of the best books I've read in recent memory actually) helps it, and that it is faithful to it is commendable, a case of being faithful to the source material actually coming off wonders rather than being bogged down by being too faithful. The not-what-they-seem characters are incredibly interesting and richly developed, especially Amy who is one of the most chilling female characters of the year. And the acting is one of the high points of the film, as good as Fincher's direction and the score are it's Rosamund Pike's knockout turn as Amy in restrained- she only has to raise an eyebrow or something like that and it says a lot- but quite terrifying mode(especially in the third act) that makes the film. It will be a great surprise if she isn't at least nominated because it is easily her best performance. Ben Affleck has the other not-what-they-seem role and plays it with oozing charm and brooding intensity, while Neil Patrick Harris surprisingly excels in a very against-type role(who knew he could be sinister?) and Tyler Perry oozes charisma and is very funny. Carrie Coon is the standout in support, it's a tricky role and the moral compass of the film but Coon is touchingly likable in it. The ending does for my liking end too suddenly and the storytelling got implausible and lazy at this point, but apart from that Gone Girl was a winner and one of the best of the year. 9/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw3097383/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2017,zkonedog,7," Captures Most Of The Book's Bizarre Mystery
","Its a little tough for me to watch/review ""Gone Girl"" seeing as how I had already read the book. For a plot that relies heavily on surprise and misdirection, I already knew what was going to happen, and that obviously makes it a different viewing experience. I was very impressed, however, by how the film was able to capture the basic essence of the Gillian Flynn novel (maybe it helped that Flynn wrote the screenplay herself!).",/review/rw3097383/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2014,CalRhys,," Dark And Twisted, Full Of Great Visual Storytelling
","Dark and twisted, David Fincher's stylish new mystery thriller was derived from Gillian Flynn's intriguingly slick tale from her complex and suspenseful novel. By far one of the best acting performances to have come from Ben Affleck, 'Gone Girl' boasts some strong yet disturbing portrayals from Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry and Affleck. Fincher has garnered fame and recognition as a mainstream director, that is not only able to engulf the audience within the picture, but actually make them part of the scenario. Fincher exercises upon his trademarks with the swift and stunning cinematography, the chilling score and tight editing, all of which makes 'Gone Girl' a movie full of great visual storytelling.",/review/rw3097383/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hate to burst the bubble (IMDb top 250, average mark over 8), but I just didn't get this David Fincher thriller at all.

11 February 2015,Mr-Fusion,5," This is what the fuss was about?
","The more time passes since finishing ""Gone Girl"", the more the aftertaste worsens. It did its job in keeping me guessing until the final credits, but with that bloated running time and those levels of hype, that can't be all it set out to do, right? Affleck and Pike are playing such bland characters that I didn't care what happened to either of the Dunne party. I cared far more for Carrie Coon and Kim Dickens, who were unquestionably side players. Neil Patrick Harris was just a plot device to get -SPOILER- Amy to return home and reveal that she was alive.",/review/rw3097383/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2015,dierregi,1," If you are blonde and beautiful the police will believe everything you say
","Gone Girl is based on convoluted premise: a psychotic plot to frame somebody for your murder. This deranged idea is not popular for movie plots and could have been worth exploring. It was developed much better in the great film noir ""Leave her to heaven"", where the framing was done in a subtler way. ",/review/rw3097383/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2014,trublu215,10," If Fincher was looking to out do himself...he has succeeded.
","Gone Girl marks Fincher's tenth feature film and his most mature work since Fight Club. Centering on Nick Dunne, a husband desperately trying to find his wife all while having police and media accuse him of murder. The story sounds straight out of the Scott Peterson case and the film looks unlike any film I've seen in recent years. Lead by an all star cast featuring Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris, Gone Girl rises above the pack with smart storytelling, phenomenal pacing and perfect performances. What Gone Girl does so brilliantly is taps into the audience's psyche regarding marriage and the ideology behind a sanctioned union that is corrupt. It is really heavy stuff when the story really gets to the meat and bones of it all. With plenty of twists and turns, Gone Girl keeps you, not only second guessing the whole idea of marriage, but the intentions of every character in the film. It is truly one of the most twisted films adapted from an even sicker and twisted book that's out there right now. Gillian Flynn does wonders with her adaption from her own novel. The dialog is crisp, the characters are multi-layered, it truly is a pitch perfect script that doesn't have one false moment in it. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are EXCELLENT in this film. This is a different Affleck, a very human and realized Affleck. Nick Dunne is a wonderful role for him and captivates just how good he can be with a terrific director. Harris and Perry give well rounded performances as well but are nothing compared to Affleck and Pike. David Fincher and his long time collaborator and cinematographer, Jeff Cronenweth create a dreary, horrific tone for Gone Girl that makes every twist and turn that much more gut wrenching. Every shot is meticulously planned, showing each shot as if it were a still frame that spoke a thousand words. It is truly gorgeous filmmaking. And now for the score...Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch deliver a perfect score, besting their Social Network and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo score. If Reznor won for Social Network, I fully expect not only a nomination but a win for this film. Overall, this is a mesmerizing film that demands multiple viewings to truly get the full experience. It is impeccably made, beautifully acted and an all around near perfect film.",/review/rw3097383/?ref_=tt_urv

29 March 2015,moonspinner55,4," Cyphers and story holes...
","""Gone Girl"" is so smoothly-filmed and staged and acted, a less-seasoned moviegoer is apt to come away from the picture with nothing but admiration and praise. An upscale married couple in New York City hits a financial bump and ends up living with the husband's family in Missouri (in an equally beautiful home, by the way). After a few years, with the relatives now deceased, the couple's marriage unravels and, before long, the wife turns up missing (their glass table is shattered and police find a mopped-up bloodbath in the kitchen). Adapting her own novel, screenwriter Gillian Flynn sets up an intriguing first-half, with the benumbed (and unfaithful) husband at first courted and then reviled by the ever-present media. But the second and third acts of the film are where it runs into trouble, ignoring story holes and stumbling over plot-points. The final scenes, which are dragged out interminably by director David Fincher, are so static and unconvincing as to be ridiculous, mitigating his fine work in presenting this lurid tale (the picture ends up being all about presentation and little else). The central couple (Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike) are thoroughly unlikable, detestable people, while most of the supporting characters (with the exception of a likably dry police detective played by Kim Dickens) are equally appalling. There is really nothing in ""Gone Girl"" to engage our interest except for Fincher's jagged, nasty way in telling a juicy story--but here, the juice leaks out early. ** from ****",/review/rw3097383/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2018,Leofwine_draca,6," Fincher makes this worthwhile
","GONE GIRL is another epic-length feature from director David Fincher, in which he gets into the nitty gritty of the material like few other directors can. This one's based on a bestselling novel about a wife's disappearance in which the finger of suspicion falls on her own husband. It's a good whodunit-style mystery which twists and turns throughout and keeps you surprised with some unpredictable moments, but I did find it rather long-winded and suffering from a lack of likeable characters. In Fincher's hands it's an enjoyable film, and it's certain that both Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike rise to the occasion to deliver lots of intense character moments. But at the same time I didn't really feel anything about what I was watching, and some of the moments feel very artificial and contrived, as if they could only come from a writer's mind rather than happen in real life.",/review/rw3097383/?ref_=tt_urv

","I love a good Thriller, and when theirs a really good one, it's a smart movie for the people who analyze the movie and didn't see the end coming, and continues to make you think. This movie falls way behind in that category. Really? Ben couldn't have just walked out? Court order for DNA of the ""Baby""? Their are so many holes on how she tried to frame him, I could rate this as Swiss cheese. It was interesting at times, and you did want to see what happens next. However that lead to a anticlimactic ending. It's to bad it had a lot of potential.",/review/rw3097383/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Gone Girl"" is a contrived, exploitative, pretentious film that aims for the middlebrow audience and hits its mark. The filmmakers insert – no pun intended – a sex scene every ten minutes or so, and alternate those with buckets-of-blood scenes of violence, and utterly predictable flashlight searches for clues of a Nancy Drew level of sophistication. If you want to see someone stabbed to death while climaxing during sex and bleed out like an upside down pig, this is the film for you. ",/review/rw3097383/?ref_=tt_urv

","The cast of ""Gone Girl"" is half decent. The leads are relatively big names - Ben Affleck as Nick and Rosamund Pike as Amy (not the biggest, but certainly known.) The supporting cast wouldn't cause me to swoon, but they're decent enough (people like Tyler Perry, Kim Dickens and Neil Patrick Harris are in this.) But regardless of the so-called ""critical consensus"" (which seems to be very positive) you don't have to get very far into this to discover that you have a half decent cast in what's at best a third-rate movie.",/review/rw3097383/?ref_=tt_urv

2 October 2014,eddie_baggins,10," Fincher has done it again! A brilliant thriller with outstounding acting turns
","As if it wasn't safe to say already, but after Gone Girl there is  little doubt or argument to be made against the fact that David Fincher  is one of the most consistently great directors working in the industry  today, for Fincher's latest efforts behind the camera with this  meticulously made, perfectly paced and often thrilling story is  movie-making of the highest order. Gone Girl (exactly like it's source  text) is a mystery/thriller that steadily morphs into what can equally  be described as a darkest of dark comedy, a searing account of married  life and an edge of your seat police procedural, all elements that  combine to create one of the year's best films.  Fincher from day one has shown an uncanny ability for visual atheistic,  haunting and atmospheric surrounds and with the help of his composers  (this time once more teaming up perfectly with Trent Reznor and Atticus  Ross) finely moulded musical accompaniments and Gone Girl shows off all  these skills once more. The suburban surrounds of the world of Gone  Girl shun the safety in numbers feel that they provide these residents;  it's not dissimilar to a world akin to Blue Velvet where beneath the  grassy exteriors lies deep seeded secrets that threaten to tear at the  seams of idealistic marriages and those double lives we people lead.  Fincher relishes every element of Gone Girl from the mysteries through  to the reveals and like only a handful of movies each year this project  feels like the perfect meeting of subject and maker who meet in synch  to create such a finally tuned product. Fincher really has become the  master of the thriller genre, much like Scorsese with his mob pictures  and after Seven, Fight Club, Zodiac, Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and  now Gone Girl, there is a legacy to his directional work that will  forever be hard to match much like Fincher's continued fine work with  his actors.  Much noise was made initially by rabid fans of Gillian Flynn's source  novel about the casting of leads Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike as Nick  and Amy Dunne but after witnessing first hand one of the year's best  double acts by the two on form actors there will be little doubt that  the casting choices were staggeringly spot on. Affleck is at his  polarising best at Nick Dunne a man we as an audience are unsure of, do  we like this man or do we loathe him? It's refreshing to see Affleck  put in such an assured turn, from inappropriate smiling through to  outright rage, Affleck's turn is an award worthy one that in a less  standout year for the male acting category would be a turn featuring  strongly come February. While Affleck once more showcases a talent we  all know he has, the breakout turn from Rosamund Pike is the films  largest revelation.  Finally given a chance to chew through not only a high profile but  layered role, Pike excels as the ""amazing"" Amy at the centre of this  twisted and depraved tale. Pike truly creates one of not only the years  but modern day cinemas most memorable and unique leading ladies, a  creation who at any given time can be compelling, outrageous,  disgusting and calculated, it really is a stunning turn to witness and  it would be unwise to suggest that Pike isn't now head and tails ahead  in the female acting awards circuit. Surrounded by quite amazing  supports from Kim Dickin's dogged detective Rhonda Boney, Carrie Coon  as Nick's twin sister Margo, Tyler Perry (proving there's more to the  man than Magdea's fat suit) as high profile lawyer Tanner Bolt and  Barney Stinson himself Neil Patrick Harris in a box cutter sharp turn  as creepy rich man Desi Collings, Pike and her on screen hubby Affleck  are encompassed around by one of the years strongest ensembles.  Without spoiling any of Gone Girl's many varied and unexpected twists  and turns (this is the type of movie best seen with as little knowledge  as possible), this is a movie thriller of the highest order that  shouldn't be watched by those expecting an everyday murder/kidnapping  mystery, for what transpires throughout this tale is anything but your  run of the mill narrative. One of the most involving movies of recent  memories, Gone Girl is bitingly funny, white knuckle tense, starkly  violent and as we've come to expect from Fincher, quite brilliant. Gone  Girl is without question one of the year's best films, one of the  year's most unique films and one of the films of this year that you  can't dare to miss.  5 Gummy Bears out of 5",/review/rw3097383/?ref_=tt_urv
