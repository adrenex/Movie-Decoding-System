4 May 2013,Fluke_Skywalker,7," Jack Reacher is an entertaining throwback
","There was a time—let's call it ""The 80s""—when action movies didn't need CGI cheats, shaky-cam and ADD-editing to entertain us. They also didn't have to destroy ten city blocks, have a ""clever"" hook or feel the need to tack on a social message to justify their carnage. No, all they needed was a reason for some good old steak and potatoes action and a star to anchor it all. 2012's Jack Reacher has these qualities in spades.",/review/rw2723103/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2016,TheLittleSongbird,7," Very enjoyable film, with a few drawbacks but also a number of strengths
","Considering the mixed reception that 'Jack Reacher' has garnered, most of the critical external reviews have been positive or mixed feelings but it also received a lot of backlash from fans of the books, it was hard to say how 'Jack Reacher' was going to turn out.",/review/rw2723103/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2013,Bruce722,9," Great film.
","Jack Reacher was a surprisingly fantastic film. I went in thinking, thanks to some slightly misleading trailers, that this was going to be a high octane action movie with a bunch of gun fights, car chases, and explosions but little development and quality. I was completely wrong. While there were a few gun fights, one car chase, and an explosion of sorts, it was done in a completely different manner and was more of an action thriller. Tom Cruise did a great job in his typical role. The rest of the supporting cast was solid enough and the cameo by Robert Duvall was awesome. The plot developed really well and made it more of a ""thinking movie"" than I anticipated. That being said, the turns in the plot kept the film from becoming stagnant or boring and the action sequences felt real and authentic. I wasn't a huge fan of some of the cinematic elements and there were some flaws in one of the plot twists but nothing that really hurt the movie-watching experience. All-in-all, I'd say this was a great movie that most people would very much enjoy watching.",/review/rw2723103/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2014,neil-476,9," Excellent action thriller
","5 people are shot dead and incontrovertible evidence leads the police to immediately pick up sniper James Barr, who simply asks for Jack Reacher. Reacher, an ex-army policeman of shadowy background, tells defence attorney Helen Rodin (who appears to have taken the case simply to spite her District Attorney father) that he believes Barr to be guilty because he got away with something similar while he was in the middle east. But he starts investigating anyway.",/review/rw2723103/?ref_=tt_urv

","Flanked by plush production values and an interesting supporting cast (including Werner Herzog as a baddie), Tom Cruise investigates at his leisure an apparent spree killing treading the mean streets as a laconic investigator after whom the film is named like Steve McQueen in 'Bullitt' (which also had Robert Duvall in it); and both prove hot stuff behind the wheel of a car.",/review/rw2723103/?ref_=tt_urv

20 August 2015,samsinthebigredbarn,10," Great movie
","I dislike Tom Cruise in general, so I was reluctant to see this movie. I was so worried it would be another asinine Misson Impossible movie. I'm so glad my wife pushed me to see it, as it was terrific. None of the super slo-mo CGI Matrix-type bullsh*t, just a Dirty Harry style movie with a great story and great bad guys and great fights. I don't believe there is any CGI in this movie at all! Amazing! Very old school, very surprising, very well done. I loved it and haven't seen a movie of this type that I enjoyed in a long, long time. I loved the way it ended... Fairly easy to see through the plot and figure out what is going on, but still very enjoyable. This is a MUST see for anyone who loved the Dirty Harry movies, or ones similar. Minimal fluff, no stupid romance, a believable plot and a good car chase. And bad guys killed the way they should be. Fantastic!",/review/rw2723103/?ref_=tt_urv

21 December 2012,EmmaDinkins,8," Chix Chat on Film Review: Reacher is the Man!
","Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is the tale of a very astute ex-military policeman. The army training came in quite handy as he digs into the evidence of a heinous crime that turns out to be not at all what it seems to be on the surface. I was surprised at how funny the dialogue in this film was, it is definitely not a comedy, but the sarcastic and comedic one-liners kept coming, even in situations that were completely devoid of a humorous setting there was some very amusing conversation. There was even a scene in which Reacher is attacked in a bathroom that had me cracking up at the bumbling bad guys. The comedy was heightened even further with the old codger Cash (Robert Duvall). Mr. Duvall always delivers a convincing performance, same here. As with any film that features Mr. Cruise the expectation is that it will be fast paced and very entertaining, same here. The only thing missing was his trademark sprint to or after something or anything. I've just come to expect to see him running, really running but we are getting older. The trailer is the only kind that I like, the ones that do not give away the whole movie. It shows that Reacher is bad a$$ without playing out every aspect of the story. David Oyelowo (Emerson) is one to watch, he is building an impressive resume and it is easy to see why because whenever he portrays a character he is that character. When he played a pilot in Red Tails, I totally believed he could fly a plane. When he was the head of a company experimenting on Apes, I was again thoroughly convinced and I believed every aspect of his being a police detective. One of the best car chase scenes that I've seen lately was in this film. There were so many attributes of this film that I liked, including the sexual tension between Reacher and Helen Ronin (Rosamund Pike) that I will just sum it up by saying. Everything just seemed to be genuine and authentic, even though I know that the fights are staged they looked logistically correct, but Steven Segal did come to mind. I liked that the film had a legitimate beginning and end, even if there are subsequent Jack Reacher tales to follow, there was no gaping wide open door of a final scene leaving the audience wondering 'What's up with that?!?'. But I do hope there are sequels, at least one. I give it a green light",/review/rw2723103/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2013,dgefroh,8," Jack Reacher....... just good fun
","Having never read any Lee Childs novels regarding Jack Reacher, I went into this one with somewhat limited knowledge on who Jack Reacher is and what his claim to fame is. So like many, I read where the ""serious"" fans were disappointed that Tom Cruise was picked to portray this iconic hero. To them I say, so what, did you watch this movie? In truth Tom Cruise is very good in this role, the movie is fast paced and action packed, the writing is cleaver and spot on, so to those who would continue to pan this movie I say lighten up and relax. This was a very good movie, Tom Cruise was good in the lead role, the several one-liners were very cleaver and kept a sense of humor in a plot with plenty of violence and too close for comfort realism. This movie was good, it was entertaining, well acted, and should be viewed and enjoyed by all who watch it.",/review/rw2723103/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2013,jtindahouse,5," A real let down for fans
","'One Shot' is my favourite book. Not my favourite Jack Reacher book. My favourite book. So when I heard they were not only going to be making a Reacher film, but making 'One Shot', I was ecstatic. Then I heard who would be playing Reacher and like 99.9% of fans I thought to myself, ""this must be an April Fool's joke. A 5'7"" skinny guy playing the hulking 250 pound, 6'5"" Jack Reacher? This can't be happening."" Sadly it was. And then the trailer came out and my worst fears were confirmed. Cruise was not being buffed up by any type of body suit, he wasn't being made to look taller with trick photography and he wasn't putting on the raspy 'animal-like' voice I always imagined Reacher to have.",/review/rw2723103/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2012,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: Jack Reacher
","Jack Reacher is written to be quite the physical giant, so when Tom Cruise got interested in the character, many would not have fathomed that Cruise himself would take the role, although I felt it was probably one of the best ways to get author Lee Child's famous investigator onto the big screen by none other than one of the biggest stars Tinseltown has to offer. Written for the screen and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, Jack Reacher the film, based upon Child's book One Shot, is a solid investigative drama dealing with a sensitive issue of today with a sniper's seemingly random shooting, and you should know better than to trust the marketers on their treatment of this film.",/review/rw2723103/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2013,Mr-Fusion,7," I want more.
","I remember seeing the trailers for ""Jack Reacher"", last year. They sold it as a badass Tom Cruise muscle care beat 'em up. So it probably turned some off when the move wound up being part crime thriller, part '70s action film (no caffeinated editing or shaky cam), methodically paced, and tension that runs at a slow burn. You can always blame the chimps in marketing.",/review/rw2723103/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2013,billygoat1071,7," Limited Greatness
","Jack Reacher is based on Lee Child's book ""One Shot"". For those who've read it, you already know Tom Cruise isn't right for the role. One would wish they could've gotten a bigger and taller actor to play the role like Hugh Jackman, or Chris Evans, or someone else. It could have been a new iconic appearance for a hero. The real problem is it seems Tom Cruise is just redoing his generic action hero performance. As much as he refuses to call himself a hero, he still looks like one but in a much glossier way. In spite of that, the film itself is a snazzy piece of entertainment that is rare in cinema these days. A neo-noir styled action blockbuster that will grip you by its storytelling and its action scenes. There's a chance that could have made this a much better film but put aside those complains, it's still pretty awesome.",/review/rw2723103/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2012,ferguson-6,5," Drink from a Boot
","Greetings again from the darkness. Lee Child has written 17 Jack Reacher books since 1997, and it's a bit surprising that it took Hollywood this long to latch on to this enigmatic lone wolf drifter who doesn't so much care about laws as he does right and wrong. Fans of the books were outraged when it was announced Tom Cruise would play the 6'5 hulking Reacher, as much of the character's appeal stems from his ability to physically dominate a situation while using very few words.",/review/rw2723103/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2014,A_Different_Drummer,4," Vanity thy name is Cruise
","Those who do not bother to study history are doomed to repeat it. In the early 1980s the best-selling series in the US was called the Destroyer. It would ultimately spawn over 200 books in the series. A producer purchased the rights and actually launched the first movie spin off using the name of the central character, instead of simply picking a single book in the series as the title. The movie was called (not making this up) REMO WILLIAMS THE ADVENTURE BEGINS. The adventure ended suddenly. The movie was terrible. There were no more. Flash forward 30 years. The best selling series in America today is by Lee Child featuring the character Jack Reacher. Fading (and ageing) actor Tom Cruise purchases the rights and produces the film. Even though he looks nothing like the character in the book, as written, he casts himself in the title role. And names the film ""Jack Reacher."" The first hour of the film is painful to watch. It is all darkness and moodiness, showing none of the ""inner process"" that made the original Reacher so interesting. The second hour, although less painful, makes the Mission Impossible series look like The Matrix in comparison. Many words came to mind while watching this. Entertainment was not one of them. Those who do not bother to study history are doomed to repeat it.",/review/rw2723103/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2012,dwpollar,3," Disappointing retread of a vigilante-style cop movie...
","1st watched 12/25/2012 – 3 out of 10(Dir-Christopher McQuarrie): Disappointing retread of a vigilante-style cop movie with Tom Cruise producing and starring, and again showing me that when a star gets too involved in a project it goes to his head. Cruise stars as the lead character, Jack Reacher, who is a former military intelligence person who doesn't go by the rules when going after his prize(aka. Dirty Harry, Charles Bronson in a bunch of movies and others). The interesting part is that it takes forever for us to understand that this movie is a retread of those types because of it's mystery story approach as we try to determine who's at fault for the initial shooting, and it's consistently confusing us all the time(which for me—was not a good thing). There are some good chase scenes and, of course, lots of rough violent scenes(I'm amazed this movie got a PG-13 rating because of this). Considering this was released shortly after the Connecticut school killings and being about a shooter of innocent folk just walking about around Pittsburgh – it should be box office poison, but from the ending it appears Cruise is attempting to have sequels but I personally don't think this is going to happen, or at least shouldn't.",/review/rw2723103/?ref_=tt_urv
