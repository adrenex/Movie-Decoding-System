14 August 2022,wonderstone_entertainment,9," Don't expect an extension of the film here. Instead, expect a show that's in a league of its own.
","It was brilliant decision not to allow this show to mimic the film, and it was pure genius not to allow the film's iconic characters, played by Gena Davis and Tom Hanks, to become boldly visible within any scene. If it either had, this show would not have had the chance for its famous storyline to grow beyond the film. If it had, this storyline would never had the opportunity to widen and increase its depth with love, hate, bigotry, fear, friendship, and passion that was presented in every episode we are blessed to watch.",/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,rockymountaingirl05,10," Love it!
","It's funny, it's well written, it's got great casting! It's got heart too, I don't know what more you could want! Excellent show! I''my always up for an all women cast, but they really did well casting the right women, in this one.",/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,sophia55,9," A fun, poignant and much needed series
","If you're here to figure out if you should watch this show or not, filter out any review with the words ""woke"" or ""historically inaccurate"" and go from there. Reading these reviews, we must have watched different shows- the costumes are gorgeous, there's tons of baseball scenes, and the characters are nuanced and authentic. It's almost like people are more critical of stories featuring women, especially Black and gay women... Overall I would highly recommend this show- it has the spirit of the movie, with in my opinion better developed characters and unparalleled performances!",/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,foreverfalling,10," God yall are annoying
",Watch 5 minutes of a show and tank its reviews because it doesn't meet your personal wants.,/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,cateainsworth,10," Fantastic!
","I don't understand the bad reviews!!! I think the show is well written and has a lot of heart. I like that there are multiple storylines and they incorporate a lot of important topics. I would like to note that these storylines aren't about being ""woke""- as some reviews have stated. All of the topics and issues included have always been around! So, sit back and enjoy the show!!",/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2022,davidsonerin-66079,10," Abbi Jacobson is a genius
",And this show is the best show I've seen all year. Immediately addicted. Cup filled up and overflowing with gratitude for the queer stories told in this show. Deserves all the praise. Thank you for making a life changing masterpiece.,/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,scullyno10,10," Best show I've watched in years
","I've binged it twice since it was released and couldn't find a single thing I didn't like even on the second time around. It's funny, heart-warming, brilliantly produced,
well written, well scored and well acted. Has the right amount of angst to pay off and there was no 'misery for misery's sake', which ruins so many other shows made today. This seems to have been written with the audience in mind, rather than to be groundbreaking or arty, and I mean that in the best possible way.",/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,MatthewCherrier,," Reminder this is NOT a documentary & all the events do not need to be 100% true
","Yes this is ""based on a true story"" but that doesn't mean it has to 100% historically accurate! The Conjuring is also ""based on a true story"" and I'm pretty sure they took some liberties & added a lot to the original story to make it more interesting. Why should this be subjected to different rules?",/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,jjxkjxtht,10," Hilarious and cute
",I could not stop laughing this show is so funny it has its sentimental moments all in all I'm hooked and the cast was a home run. (Pun intended) I mean who doesn't love d'arcy she is always amazing.,/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,lbbiehle,10," This is entertainment, not a documentary.
","It's beyond cringey to me that all these negative reviews are complaining about historical accuracy with this show. I'll bet this is the same group that think Rudy is the best sports movie of all
Time (and is rife with inaccuracies and flat out lies.) This show has elements of historically accurate events, it never claimed it was seeped in 100% facts. This is entertainment. I was a D1 college athlete and I am beyond thrilled to see a sports series based on an amazing movie that was based on a sports team for women. And, I'll let you asshats worried about ""wokeness"" in on a little secret...the original women's baseball league did indeed have lesbians. Just bc it wasn't socially acceptable in the 1940s to be gay doesn't mean they didn't exist.",/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,wils-78556,10," Love it
","Such great acting, character development and story line. I really got into this series and couldn't stop watching and finished the series in the one day. Really impressed with the remake! I really would love a season 2!",/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,n4love16,10," Even better than expected!!
","This show pays homage to the movie while fleshing out aspects of the time that the movie wasn't able to. You can tell that a lot of research, talent, & love went into making it. It's full of humor and heart throughout and such an enjoyable experience that I immediately started a rewatch after finishing it!",/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,emilypatchie,10," so so good
","Just finished this series and honestly one of the best shows i've watched in a long long time. It's hard to make a show where you don't get bored, at least in some parts i find but this show had me entranced. Can't wait for next season!",/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,floatingdriftwood,10," A Fresh Adaptation
","This version is giving me everything I'd want in a modern series. It may not be historically accurate, but I don't want to watch a History Channel series. What I do want to see are characters we previously didn't get to see on screen, and that's what I'm getting. These are queer women who historically would have been straight washed for tv/film. I'm excited to see how these characters develop because the cast is phenomenal. I enjoyed the film version on its own, but I'm glad they decided to make updates.",/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,brookemckinney,10," Really good show hope it gets another season.
",I liked how they took things from the original movie. I am a really big fan of the movie ever since I watched it and now I love watching the show. I like the story lines and if a season two does happen I hope they go in more depth of them in the characters.,/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,izzymellor-06005,10," It *Is* Historically Accurate
",I've seen a lot of people complaining that this show isn't historically accurate. You've been told a lie. Gay bars did exist in the 40s. Some women on the league were actually queer (just watch A Secret Love on Netflix!). Trans people have been going incognito since at least the 1800s. I am so glad they made this show. The only inaccurate thing is the sometimes anachronistic dialogue! And that's ok!,/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,sgtmian,10," Telling the stories the movie didn't dare tell.
","If you like female centered stories, if you don't hate gay people or are racist, if you like stepping outside your own bubble in the world, you're going to like this show. It uses the movie as inspiration but tells all the stories that weren't possible to tell in 1992. Stories the movie hinted at. The stories of the queer women in the league, of which there were many (it's women playing baseball, anyone who is surprised by that doesn't know a single gay person), and the stories of the black women for whom the league wasn't even an option, who had to fight even harder to get to play. The storylines are engaging, the characters are well developed, the performances are great, and it's fun.",/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,AJ5000,8," Be honest, you were never going to like it
","For all the reviewers saying they wanted the series to be more like the movie, be honest - you wouldn't have liked that either. The movie is excellent and the series is clearly inspired by it but different, new, unique....and great. It is easy to watch, and there are some lovely nods to the movie. There's an opportunity for a bit more depth into the characters and the dynamics of the league in a 2nd season, but overall it is a really well done show. For everyone trashing it with 1-star, it must suck never being happy.",/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,applesarahgate,10," Great show
",This is a great show that gives nods to the movie but expands the story to share the lives of the many women playing baseball at the time. I also really appreciate how developed the women are. They have flaws and talents and are allowed to have really arcs. Also love that the writers said their will be no male redemption store in this show!,/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2022,FIoret,10," GO PEACHES!!!!
",So throughly enjoyable. Lots of laughs and tears. Thank you Abbi for bringing so many untold stories to the screen. I can't wait for season 2.,/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,pvtsross,9," Entertaining
",If anyone thinks that the original film was to fact then don't watch this series. But if you want to watch women play baseball with side plots then this is for you. And to the guy who called in fake learn how to spell maybe someone would take you more seriously.,/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,alajicreates,10," Fun, timely, and sweet
","I love this show, it really takes me back into time, the cast is stellar and it truly has me laughing. It really teaches me a perspective that I don't often think about. It gives us a peak into the challenges without being overbearing. It is very fun to watch!!! Especially the baseball scenes. Love the writing.",/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,orcinussr,7," Well idk about what that dudes talking about re the 1star
","I actually enjoy watching Abbi Jacobson and saw the film and figured this would be a fun and entertaining show - and it is! Much more so than I had expected so, what a pleasant surprise - forgive me that this isn't more of a critical review as I am only on episode 1.",/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,lilcsmom,10," It's not the movie.
","If you are expecting the same as the movie, you are going to be disappointed as the movie is more about the baseball and was made in a time where lgbtqia did not happen in the movies. If you expect Characters not to be lesbian then you obviously don't know anything about any of the real players. If you expect it all to follow the same movie plot line and not develop characters for future seasons, you again are going to be disappointed. Now, if you know that there were lesbian ball players even way back then, if you know that there were black women who wanted to play way back then and if you want to see where these ladies are headed, this is an amazing show. If you want to see a show about life even back then, this is an amazing show.",/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,jackie-meyer,10," Impossible to stop watching
","This show is so good! Everything I loved about the movie is here, but without hiding the complications of the times. I really hope people watch this. The characters are interesting and the history is not well known. But it needs to be.",/review/rw8443669/?ref_=tt_urv
