16 February 2008,alexkolokotronis,8," Will Keep You Debating On What Is Truly Right
",I had wanted to see this movie for sometime now. I have finally gotten to see it and can tell you it is no disappointment. This movie had a particular touch that gave a genuine and authentic feeling to it. Ben Affleck has a way of writing about life on the streets in Boston that just grabs you. Good Will Hunting was a fine example of that but Gone Baby Gone displayed his directing abilities as well. This movie appeared that it could fall apart any second but yet the story held up and managed to get its message out. Ben Affleck seems to be very creative and knows how to get your attention right when he want you to.,/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2007,the_Poppuns,10," When Keeping It Real Goes Right
","I would consider myself to be a movie buff and I live and grew up in Massachusetts. I must tell you that Ben Affleck has done an outstanding job in his directorial debut. In casting his brother Casey you may think that it's just nepotism or giving his brother a break. No. He is the absolute perfect person to play this role. Because they know the area they have made one of the most authentic movies I've ever seen. And it's not just some Boston movie either. I heard a woman as I was leaving saying it's just like The Departed. No it's not, it's much better and the fact is, I loved The Departed. But that was flashier. As great as it was you could tell people were acting. Not here. They seemed exactly like the degenerates and handful of decent folk I see every day of my life. The woman who plays the girl's mother, I don't know who see is, but I've met her about 1000 times.",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2007,dead47548,10," Ben Affleck crafts a disturbing emotional adaptation.
","After a decade of critically disgraced performances and brutal public humiliation year after year, Ben Affleck took a well deserved break from the Hollywood scene. This year he came back, but instead of taking the spotlight by starring in a film, he went behind the scenes and opted to direct his first feature film. Taking an example from another actor turned director, a little independent man named Clint Eastwood, he decided to adapt a novel written by Mystic River author Dennis Lehane. On the surface, Gone Baby Gone tells the story of a missing child and the two private investigators who are hired to find her. The story transforms into a highly disturbing tale of selfish, terrifying characters and the fact that no matter what people never change.",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2007,Craig_McPherson,10," A masterpiece
","Every once in a while, amid the dross that reviewers have to sit through, comes a movie that hits like a sucker punch to the gut and haunts you long after you've left the theater. Such is the case with Gone Baby Gone.",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2008,claudio_carvalho,8," People Cannot Choose, but They Are Fruit of Their Town, Neighborhood and Family
","The tough private eyes Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) was raised in a poor and dangerous neighborhood of Boston, and works with his partner and girlfriend Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) generally tracking missing losers in debt. When the four year-old Amanda McCready (Madeline O'Brien) is abducted from her apartment, her aunt Beatrice 'Bea' McCready (Amy Madigan) calls the police and the press, and the case is highlighted with the spots by the media. Then Bea hires the reluctant Patrick to work in the case because he is not a cop and based on his great knowledge of their neighborhood. Meanwhile Capt. Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman), who lost his own daughter many years ago and is in charge of the investigation, assigns detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Pole (John Ashton) to give the necessary support to Patrick. After interviewing the addicted low life mother of Amanda, Helene McCready (Amy Ryan), Patrick goes to a bar and discloses that Helene was on the streets with her boyfriend Skinny Ray Likanski (Sean Malone) dealing and using drugs on the day Amanda disappeared. Along his investigation, Patrick faces smalltime criminals, drug dealers, pedophiles and corruption, facing a moral issue to solve the case.",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2007,brenttraft,9," One of the Year's Best
","""Gone Baby, Gone"" is one of the best films of the year. It is being compared to ""Mystic River"" and ""The Departed"" because it takes place in Boston, but I actually liked it better than either of those films.",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2007,ClaytonDavis,10," Gone but Never Forgotten
","In his directorial debut, Ben Affleck has completely morphed himself into an emerging artist and even more challenging director. Gone Baby Gone might be the most innovative and moral challenging film of recent years. This is the story of young Amanda, a little girl who mysteriously disappears from her home and the activity and dangers that befall upon the people involved in her finding.",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2007,brefane,7," See it before it's gone, baby, gone!
","Ben Affleck's impressive directorial debut features some remarkably naturalistic performances, a genuine sense of locale, and an atmosphere of despair and hopelessness that becomes a major antagonist. An honestly downbeat film, it portrays a mode of existence where nothing is black or white, and it is that gray area that the film explores so effectively even if I find the story from Dennis Leheane's novel to be a bit far-fetched and convoluted. More than The Departed, Mystic River, and Peter Yates' The Friends of Eddie Coyle, Gone, Baby, Gone understands the inter-relationship among cops, criminals, and a neighborhood as they search for a missing child. Though the boyish Casey Affleck is arguably miscast as Patrick, a character who was more mature in the novel, his performance cannot be faulted and by the end he has won us over. The last scene is particularly resonant. Though well-known actors such as Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman are expectedly good, it is the performances of an unknown supporting cast that gives the film a disturbing authenticity. And Amy Ryan as the child's mother gives a trenchant performance. Director Affleck maintains an admirable tone of objectivity and compassion throughout, and he has made a film that is worthy of your time. Go!Baby!Go!",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2008,blackburnj-1,7," Flawed film with a great deal of promise
","It is now largely forgotten that Ben Affleck's big break was not as an actor in but as a writer of ""Good Will Hunting"". His career has never lived up to the promise of his performance in that film (a quiet and subtle display) and has been overshadowed by the success of his friend and co-Oscar-winner, Matt Damon. With ""Gone Baby Gone"", Affleck moves back behind the camera, directing and writing, whilst his brother Casey, who really impressed in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"", takes the lead.",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2007,RussyPelican,9," Great Baby Great
","When I went into the theater to see Gone Baby Gone, Casey Affleck was not what I pictured when I read Dennis Lehane's Patrick Kenzie novels. But he won me over and will now forever be Kenzie as far as I'm concerned.",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2008,Polaris_DiB,3," It was almost there...
","The first two-thirds of this movie is honestly great. Ben Affleck presents a new level of dark and grit in a story about an abducted child, the private investigators hired to find her, and the local Boston community--a much more ugly background of extras typically used in even the most ""social realist"" of film works, where the grim of the street is more effectively incorporated into the scarred visages of people without make-up effects. It's a compelling and dark look at a reality where children go missing all the time, where the media has a field-day with the attention while real families are brought into conflict and even the emotional demands of cops are not fully brought into closure.",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2008,TxMike,," A question of ethics and morals, what would you do?
","A very good movie, directed by Ben Affleck in the same Boston neighborhoods he grew up in. A young girl disappears, the police and private investigators search for her, but when you don't find a child within the first day or so, usually it means the child is ""Gone Baby Gone.""",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv

22 December 2007,lhhung_himself,5," Where have all the screenwriters gone?
","The idea behind this film is fundamentally a good one - which is not surprising since it is based on a novel. And despite the horribly clichéd, implausible and convoluted screenplay, some of those original ideas remain. Also, to be fair, there are some nice moments in the film and it does not go Spielberg on us.",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2021,premedprincessxo,5," Worth the watch but can't get over the ridiculous plot
","Interesting movie in that it makes you think about ethical decision-making in tough situations. It is worth a one-time watch. However, the acting of the lead actor is dreadful and so is the girlfriend's. Thankfully there is a strong supporting cast to pick up the slack in that department.",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv

2 July 2008,bob the moo,," Complex, engaging thriller with strong delivery from cast and crew
","When a young girl goes missing from a rough Boston neighbourhood, the relatives of the less-than-sympathetic mother turn to private detective Patrick Kenzie who they hope can help with his local knowledge. Kenzie instantly does two things  one being rubbing the police the wrong way with his involvement, the other being proving his worth by exposing lies the police have been told by key people. However, with the clock ticking, time is running out and the odds dwindling for finding the child alive.",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2021,Kirpianuscus,," the truth essence
","I love Ben Affleck as director. This film is one of good motives. Because it is an impecable moral/ religious film. A great one, in fact. A film about apparences and cold fair decision. About parenthood and its profound meanings. About naivety or innocence or acceptance of tough decision consequences. An admirable cast, impressive acting and the wise way to tell the perfect story because, in so many senses, it is the story of the viewer. And , sure, the beautiful job of Cassey Affleck is the axis of a film who, in fact, represents more than a masterpiece but a challenge to the public.",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2007,ssflady1963,9," WOW, Better than I expected
","Anytime a movie can get you to pause and consider a moral dilemma (what would I have done?) while watching it definitely deserves a high mark in my book!! This movie showed the very raw, mean streets of Boston's underbelly and didn't sugar-coat anything. I liked that it was real and not made all pretty for film as in so many other films of late. I have/will recommend this movie to all my friends. Kudos to Casey Affleck, Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris. This was, so far, the best movie I've seen in 2007. I haven't been impressed with Ben Affleck in front of the camera, but maybe he's found his niche - behind the camera? Just go see it.",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2008,oneloveall,6," Overrated but mildly worthwhile
","A somewhat entertaining morality drama of the Hollywood variety, this baby doesn't really get going until the convoluted first and second acts are played out, culminating in a more emotionally involving conclusion. Speckled with much homegrown Bah-stonian flavor, the newfound directorial talents of big bro Ben Affleck to portray the city he loves with a notion of gritty integrity perhaps overwhelms with some shiftily stereotypical minor characters- both in look and delivery, but the core cast remain strong enough to let the overcooked plot come to a gentle simmer when we finally are able to understand what all the messy details add up to. The result is certainly far shy of the riveting, infinitely ponderous conclusion some have suggested, but still absolutely enough to make for a decent night of serious entertainment for mainstream American audiences.",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2007,loquegustas,10," I was surprised at this movie being so good
","Being retired I have all the time in the world to do what pleases me. And seeing movies pleases me a lot, so much that I see almost everything, good, regular, bad and really baaaad. Seeing a movie for me is being at the cinema showing it, paying for my ticket, and I hardly ever watch a movie in TV, direct or recorded. This means that in order to keep up with my statement of seeing almost everything I go to see movies a minimum of five and a maximum of seven days per week, and some days I attend several movies (this is not an exaggeration), meaning that I do get to see 250 to 300+ movies every year.",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv

17 March 2008,lee_eisenberg,5," still, it seems a little empty
","When I saw that ""Gone Baby Gone"" is from the same author as ""Mystic River"", I suspected that I was in for something gritty. While ""GBG"" has the same kick-in-the-gut feeling as ""MR"", it lacks the grimness and overall seems more like a Hollywood movie.",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2009,rbrb,1," Dreadful baby dreadful
","What ruins this movie is that the whole story is totally preposterous and ridiculous.A child is kidnapped and the film then embarks on a nonsensical whodunit which in the end poses a moral dilemma that in effect the chief of police stole the kid to give it a better life so why not leave things alone and allow the policeman to keep the kid....dear oh dear, give me a break! And no there is no argument, because in real life( not fantasies such as this) children no matter what the background of their natural parents should stay with them in most situations apart from abuse etc. Along the way getting to the nonsense ending we have all sorts of wholly unrealistic scenes and dialogs which I will not bother to relate as it wastes my time and are just completely far fetched. The lead actor is meant to be a outstanding person who faces the aforesaid moral dilemma yet in another scene he shoots an albeit loathsome yet unarmed man in the back of the head and is treated as a hero for doing that.No wonder the USA has a gun problem. Morgan Freeman gives an almost identical performance in every film; he is like a puppet except his mouth moves sometimes; Ed Harris wears a cocker spaniel hair piece which makes him look laughable. The romance interest of the lead is an excruciatingly bad actress. The makers of this film have an agenda: all celebrities because of their status and wealth are entitled-so the propaganda of the picture suggests- to whatever children they want and if that means kidnapping them so be it. Complete rubbish. 1/10.",/review/rw2035762/?ref_=tt_urv
