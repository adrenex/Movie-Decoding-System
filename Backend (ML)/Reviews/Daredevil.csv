29 November 2008,as_santos,9," Fun fantasy to watch
","I heard about this series by a friend that said ""Just don't read the comments before you see it"". Of course, that was the very first thing I did, and let me tell you how afraid was after I read them!! I though this series was going to suck big time, but had to see it by myself and guess what - I loved it! OK, it's not phenomenal, but it's quite good. I was kept interested, the photography was awesome, the costumes, too. I've only just seen the first two, but I sure am going to see the others and if they continue like this I'll be a fan. I'm not sure if I'd would of liked it had I read the books that this series is based on, but I think I would have. I've always been good at separating the books from their interpretations to the theater or television. When I watched ""Legend of the Seeker"" I watched the show for itself and therefore I enjoyed it very much. It's good entertainment for a fantasy series and I was actually quite surprised by the excellent performance of the actress Bridget Regan.",/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2008,MidnightWraith,8," Exactly what Terry said it would be... and I'm glad.
","I bought Wizard's First Rule the day it was released in 1994, simply because of the great cover art and my love for new, good fantasy books. What I got was my favorite fantasy series of all time, including Tolkien and Jordan. I am a published author myself, as well as having a profile on this website. I am an avid reader of classic literature since 1975, especially fantasy. So, written above, is my claim to believability.",/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2008,justcozy,9," Great Show
","I loved this show, I catch is by chance on the CW this past Sunday (saw the third and forth episodes) and was instantly hooked. I missed having a great adventure, swords blazing, fantasy including and hero adoring show on TV. I immediately looked up the first two episodes that I missed online and watched them.

3 December 2008,sdifgiopasj,8," Fun, entertaining, sword-slicing fantasy.
","So how is the Legend of the Seeker? What do people think so far? Looking at the comments we get a load of onestars from people saying it doesn't follow the books to the letter, people that can't understand how Goodkind could ""sell his soul to Hollywood"" (really... wow), and people that make untrue claims about inaccuracies in the TV-series apparently without having watched it themselves.

",This series is what all fans of great books dread.,/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2008,loriens_star,10," As someone who hasn't read the books...
","...I'm actually really enjoying this series (as of episode 4). I started watching Legend of the Seeker knowing that I was signing up for extreme fantasy, and must say it's very entertaining. It is a huge call to pay off a story of this scale every week without looking embarrassingly cheap, especially with all the special effects required. To the show's credit, it embraces what it is and delivers an unusually high standard for television. ",/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2009,pasa-2,1," Horrible mutilation of a fantastic book
","I just don't get it, really. They could make more Xena. More Hercules crap. Mix them with Robin Hood, or whatever.",/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2008,hahayes1,8," Legend of the Seeker
","I for one think it is great to have something like this on television. Good versus evil with the trio cast here is fun to watch. The special effects are terrific, and I like how the episodes are going. I love the wizard, the Seeker is awesome, and the Confessor makes my husband want to watch! Love it! Keep it coming!",/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2009,rufsetufshesten,1," The pain!!!
","Why? Why, Terry? I mean if you're this hard up for cash, I could have lent you a few bucks. There was no need to whore yourself out like this. I've read all of the books in the Sword of truth series, and I liked them. Not the best fantasy ever written, but that's beside the point.",/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2010,cholt7,10," Legend of the Seeker
","Legend of the Seeker is action packed, there is romance, magic, stunning locations, great cast and movie quality special effects. This is the best show on TV. If it is given proper promotion and permanent time slot it will be a huge hit!!! So many people are just finding out about the show and are falling in love with it. I just happened to run across it one Saturday afternoon by chance during season 1 and was immediately hooked. It is now the only ""must watch"" on TV for me. I bought Season 1 as soon as it came out and have ordered Season 2. This show is epic and deserves to go on. I have read the books and love the series. I know it doesn't follow the books exactly, however I have yet to see ANY book brought to the screen (big or small) that does. I am not a fan of the so-called ""reality"" shows. I have enough reality in my own reality. Give me Fantasy and take me away for awhile. This show is perfect. We need to have Seasons 3,4,5...",/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2008,aaakker,6," For a younger audience
","I really hoped Legend of the Seeker would be nothing like Hercules or Xena! As these series have the same director. Just that comparison makes me sick as I am a fan of (some) of the books this is based on. The acting in Xena and Hercules was terrible, the script pretty bad, historically nonsense and it never was really serious. Face it, it was perfect after a long night of drink and you are lying on your couch with a hangover (just like the shows of Bob Ross!). But i would like something i enjoyed as much as Wizards first rule to be made seriously. Good actors, serious acting, historically believable (do not use Hercules/Xena like clothing or the fake looking weapons) and please, please do not make it for children.",/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2009,emase3162005,1," What a waste
","I was incredibly excited when I heard that they were making a TV production of sword of truth because I thought Terry Goodkind's series is awesome. The book happened to pop in my mind and I decided to check Goodkind's site to see if any new books were coming out (related or unrelated to SoT). I found out about the show yesterday (it probably been out for a year) and went to bed thinking, ""im going to wake up tomorrow and catch up on every episode""...that's how stoked I was. And I was incredibly disappointed.",/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2008,ayuni9984,9," Unexpectedly charming!!
","When I first heard about the TV series, I knew it was an adaptation of a book. At first, I didn't want to watch it thinking that the TV series is surely not as good as the book. Of course. Surprisingly it is charming and captivating to watch. It is like an addiction, you want to watch it again and again.",/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2017,chisom_kk,10," My All-time Favorite Show from my Childhood (Actually my Preteen Years) Now I'm 20
","I remember when this show aired on TV, I used to watch everyday coming back from church religiously. Like it became a tradition and my parents would watch it with me sometimes. As a female, I loved Kahlan. However, I liked Cara's fierceness. Things the others would be afraid to do, she was be brazen and do it. Interesting how she used to work for the enemy and then came on their side. Sad how she was ripped away from her parents and forced to be a Mord'Sith. I never understood Lord Rahl's desire for Kahlan. Idk whether it's just wanting a Confessor son. It's so bizarre. Ahh, I miss this show. Haven't watched it in years. Although, I'm start the entire series now.",/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2008,jetodd40,," unwise to draw too much from teaser clip
","All any of us have so far is a cast list (incomplete) and a rather short teaser trailer, lets not go off the deep end judging the whole series based on it.",/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2008,Blackspecter,5," Sad but not surprised
","As many of the people commenting this series I'm a huge fan of the books, got them all and have read them over and over. As someone mentioned, making a TV-series of a book is hard and rarely follows the story page by page. What makes me sad is that they often, the case with LotS, is that they change small details that they don't have to change.",/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2012,vadim_2,10," Amazing.
","Do not listen to those who complain that Legend of the Seeker is bad because it doesn't look like the book, but which movie/ series is? Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter aren't either, they also have a lot of missing parts. The series are called Legend of the Seeker and not Sword of Truth for a reason, it can't and no way to make it similar to the books. Facts are that Terry Goodkind wants the series to continue and changes go with his approval as well.",/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2021,OneAnjel,10," Spectacular settings costumes and storyline
","I didn't read the books, didn't even know they existed and don't care. I absolutely love this series --the premise, the characters, the romance, the friendships, the magic... I'm a big fan of good fantasy and this one is special to me. It's done innocently but with huge vision and seems to be no cost spared. I actually thought Richard was not well-cast at first but he grew on me. I think people who complain that a film or series doesn't match the book(s) are missing the point. I'll probably read the books someday, but honestly, it would not be to compare them to this amazing series. One of the best fantasy shows ever created.",/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2008,dragonchowguild,10," Spot On
","So far, the trailer is almost perfect. Zedd is way too tall, but still a good choice. Casting the physical parts over the personality is always a mistake, and comes off too Disney-like in the end. The age of the guy playing Darken Rahl would concern me most of all, but only because he appears too young to be the age of Richard's father.",/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2016,TreeOfWolf,10," Bluring the good vs evil clichés into something awesome!

10 July 2011,ajknexlang,1," hang on, gouging my eyes out
","I tried. I really did. I watched the complete first episode and read the books all over again just to make sure i wasn't hallucinating about how frickin amazing the books are. The acting drove me up the wall and the CGI looks like it was done with photoshop. I was reading the great reviews here and I can't believe people actually think it's good. Like don't get me wrong, I can totally not compare it to the books and still think it's a terrible show. Every now and then I'll wonder what they did with a certain character so I'll TRY to watch an episode and tear my hair out after 2 minutes. Like honestly, if you think this show is good, you have very low standards.",/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2009,sgtok,1," loved the books hate the show
","Couldn't they even come close to the books? This is horrible. I got excited because they come close in the minor detail but then they blow the major details. I really tried to view this as something different, but if you read the books the show is really bad. They completely changed the entire basis. Zed was Richards friend from the beginning. Later you find out he is Zed's grandson. This completely ruins that. Best thing I can say about this is it is better than the movie Battlefield Earth. This is my favorite series of books (author blew the last one, but on the whole is a great series). Really want to get thru the show to see how they did the Mord Sith portion, but I just cant do it.",/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2009,chrisisstressed,6," Not The Books, But Still Worth While In Its Own Right!
",Like most who read the Sword of Truth books I eagerly awaited seeing what the series treatment would make of it. But you have to keep in mind that no film/series/miniseries is ever exactly the same as its source material.,/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2014,hlg2401,10," I love this series!
","I have watched every episode of Legend of the Seeker over 10 times now and fall in love more every time. I like that the show and books are different, it give the show more feeling. The thing that can make or break a T.V show is the chemistry between actors. It's safe to say that Craig and Bridget are a match made in heaven. They work off each other so well, I love their interaction and the magnetism is electric. I haven't seen two people click with each other more. Bruce Spence adds the light-hearted comedy aspect that works so well. Tabrett's character is one that you will fall for without even knowing it. I highly recommended this show for anyone that loves fantasy and romance.",/review/rw2953924/?ref_=tt_urv
