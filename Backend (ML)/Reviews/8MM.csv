1 July 2008,Dragoneyed363,8," Perfect casting is what makes this movie wonderful
","I was completely astonished the first time I saw the movie, Definitely, Maybe. It truly was, as my summary suggests, absolutely wonderful, and that has mostly to do with the performances by the casts' dedication, though the plot and execution of the entire film was remarkable, as well, and the whole atmosphere and the way the movie folds out is incredible.",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2008,DICK STEEL,10," A Nutshell Review: Definitely, Maybe
","One guy and the four loves of his life. Writer-director Adam Brooks paints a very romantic tale that I could have seen some personal relation to, and reinforces the notion that perhaps timing is everything. You may have met the most perfect person whom you believe to be able to forge a relationship with, but circumstances sometimes will decide otherwise, and when it happens, it's way beyond one's control.",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2010,napierslogs,8," Maybe the 'Best romantic comedy since Annie Hall'
","""Definitely, Maybe"" was marketed with the line ""Best romantic comedy since Annie Hall."" At first I was appalled because it must be a lie, and how dare they put it in the same sentence as Woody Allen. But as I struggled to find many examples of what could be the best, I relented my negativities towards this film.",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2008,robertallenandersonjr,9," Definitely a must see movie
","I just saw this movie today and I loved it. I was the only teenage guy in the theatre also. The movie had a great message to it about always being happy. The little girl in this movie was also great she brought a lot to this movie, with out her this would not have been a good movie. The acting was good and the direction was especially good as well. I saw this with my dad today and it brought tears to his eyes. So this movie was also a tear jerker. For someone that loves romantic comedy movies I think would love this movie. It was a little slow moving but I kind of expected it to be. After it got near the end of the movie though it really got you thinking and wishing for him to end up with the girl he was meant to be with. It kind of also took little twists which were good as well. Ryan Reynolds did a terrific job in this movie playing a father who is going through a divorce. Then his daughter tries to help him find his true love. This movie was everything I hoped for so I think that you should definitely take someone to see this movie and have a great time.",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2012,Movie_Muse_Reviews,7," The setup might feel cheap, it's an engaging, usually sincere romantic tale
","There's not a lot of mystery in romantic comedies, aside from perhaps ""who's the baby daddy?"" which is coincidentally not too far off from the hook Adam Brooks uses in his film ""Definitely, Maybe.""",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2008,RikerDonegal,9," Great storytelling makes otherwise ordinary rom-com something special.
","When his ten-year-old daughter starts asking awkward questions about his impending divorce - and his life before she was born - a thirtysomething Manhattan dad sits her down and tells her the story of his three great loves. He changes the names to keep the surprise of who he eventually married, and he spins a charming story - spanning fifteen years - of loves lost and found and lost again.",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2008,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," Definitely Watchable
","When I first saw the trailer for Definitely, Maybe, it looked like an alright film that was probably just your average Valentine's Day love fest movie. But I got to see it for free, if the price is right, why not? So I watched it and actually I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Ryan Renolds, I love the guy in comedies, I haven't seen him in drama, so I was a little skeptical, but after seeing Definitely, Maybe, he pulled in a good performance that surprised me. The only thing I have to say I was a little disappointed in was Abigail Breslin, her performance in Little Miss Sunshine was wonderful and heart warming, Definitely, Maybe didn't bring in her best performance, who knows? It could've been the script or director, but she pulls a decent enough performance to where the movie works and puts a different twist on the average romantic comedy.",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2014,A_Different_Drummer,9," One of the best rom-coms EVER
","Hollywood and its relentless bias for quantity not quality has made cynics of us all. In the case of this lost gem, it is no coincidence that (as of the date this review is penned) the top rated IMDb critique basically says that the writer was expecting junk ... and yet was pleasantly surprised.",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2008,godzillandg,7," Good movie.
","I heard about this movie almost a year before it came out. I'm a big Ryan Reynolds fan. I wondered if the movie would ever come out and then I heard it was going to be released on V-day. ""YES!"" I thought ""finally"". Then the girl I went to see the movie with was five minutes late so that meant that I missed the set up to the movie. But the movie was utterly enjoyable just the same.",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2008,nturner,9," A Believable Tale with a Big, Big Heart
","This turned out to be a surprisingly good little romance with touches of humor. I must admit that I wasn't expecting much when I sat down to watch this film, but it turned out to be a total viewing pleasure for me. One of the reasons for my low expectations is that I had just watched Chaos Theory in which Ryan Reynolds plays the role of a family man whose life is turned upside down. In fact both films start the same why in which an older, wiser Ryan tells the story in a series of flashbacks. From there on, they couldn't be farther apart. Whereas Chaos Theory is a mess of hysteric scenes and overacting, Definitely, Maybe is a believable tale with a big, big heart.",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2008,stephenm-18,7," Seen worse. Seen a whole lot worse.
","For some people, the romantic comedy genre is there to be sneered at. It's a lower art form subscribed to by the uneducated masses, the same plot regurgitated through a word processor with names, dates and locations changed: (""Girl meets boy, she's feisty, he's snobbish, they don't see eye to eye - How oh how are they ever going to end up together by the end of the movie?""). Admittedly, I'm not the biggest advocate of the ol' romcom, but this film falls into the ""watchable"" category of romantic comedy. Of course it's phoney and sugar-coated. Of course it has no resemblance to real life - ",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2018,gbill-74877,9," Charming
","I've always had a soft spot for this one, and well done romantic comedies in general. Yes, they are lightning rods for criticism, sometimes bordering on schmaltz and/or formulaic. However, 'Definitely, Maybe' avoids all that reasonably well, and is as entertaining for me as the classic films of this genre from yesteryear, with a script peppered with funny lines, a great cast, and an endearing plot. A young girl (Abigail Breslin) demands that her father (Ryan Reynolds) tell her about the time he met her mother, and why it is that despite falling in love then, they're now heading for divorce. Reynolds agrees under the condition he won't reveal which of the women in the story of his past ultimately became her mother. Told in a flashback, we see his early years working on the Bill Clinton presidential campaign, and the women in his life (Elizabeth Banks, Isla Fisher, and Rachel Weisz). All of the principals turn in strong performances, with Isla Fisher in particular dialing up her considerable charms. The subplot of collecting old editions of 'Jane Eyre' with inscriptions in them, along with the scene with the line ""I kept the book because it was the only thing that I had left of you"" is touching. The proposal scene in Central Park is also fantastic. Director Adam Brooks captures some great shots in New York and includes a great soundtrack. This is a smart, funny, and entertaining rom-com.",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2008,ucanusemy,7," Saw an advance screening and actually enjoyed it!

22 April 2020,ThomasDrufke,9," Sometimes It's a Matter of ""When"" and Not ""Who""
","In a similar vein to La La Land and 500 Days of Summer, Definitely Maybe deals with relationships in a surprising real and touching way. These films have a way of representing love in a way that mostly depends on timing and where you are in your life. I've always loved the idea that sometimes love is more a matter of 'when' then it is about 'who' comes into your life and Definitely Maybe certainly covers that brilliantly. It also serves as an example of how good Ryan Reynolds can be in more dramatic heavy films. This is a must watch.",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2008,bcastori-1,9," A nice romantic movie for the nostalgic viewer
","As usual with romantic comedies, don't believe much of the negative critique you read about this movie. The move is very entertaining, very romantic, and will play on your nostalgic side if you have one. If you're a 20 something that has been in and out of some significant relationships, this will hit close to home, in a positive way. I wouldn't suggest this movie for a first date because it's not quite light-hearted and happy enough. Watch this one on a second or third date OR watch it with someone you've known for a while who you are about to reveal your feelings to. I promise you - it'll set you up nicely...",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2009,Chrysanthepop,," Between a Maybe and a Definitely
","The intention behind Adam Brooks's 'Definitely, Maybe' may be sincere, the film has heart but it's the writing that is disappointing. It could have used more comic sequences as it gets a tad dull at times. Most of the jokes that were used were not even funny, especially that whole sex-ed thing in the beginning (which is the kind of thing you expect in a bad American comedy). There are a few plot holes and the mystery behind 'who the mother is' isn't convincingly told.",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2008,Robert_duder,8," Really sweet, cute and surprisingly intelligent romantic comedy!
","I think it's been a really long time since I saw and truly enjoyed a good romantic comedy. The days of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks are long behind us and a lot of the romantic comedies nowadays don't fit the bill. I think maybe my expectations for Definitely, Maybe were a little low, I didn't really think it would be mind blowing and yet when I saw it I was very, very pleasantly surprised. First and foremost Definitely, Maybe is smart...really smart. It's not stereotypical or even predictable which is really impressive for that genre. They found a really good way to break the romantic comedy predictably aspect. Everyone has really good chemistry together and really you're sharing different romance stories all rolled into one and in some ways you kind of get to experience two different kind of endings. Just when I thought they had taken the ending in a way that disappointed me, they pulled it back around so that I got the ending that I think it should have had. All around it was just really fun, and sweet, and very intelligent and just great to watch. Director Adam Brooks hasn't had a lot of directing experience but he has had a lot of writing experience...some good and some bad.",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2013,SnoopyStyle,8," Different kind of rom-com
","Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds) is an ad exec about to get divorced. After a particularly in depth discussion about sex in her school, he is harassed by his daughter Maya (Abigail Breslin) to talk about her mother. He finally relents but explains he's going to change the names and some of the facts. It becomes a story of ""How He Met Her Mother"" as he recounts past girlfriends Emily (Elizabeth Banks), April (Isla Fisher), and Summer (Rachel Weisz).",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2008,TxMike,," Definitely maybe a good movie. We liked it.
","If you look at the movies Ryan Reynolds has been in he seems to specialize in fluff, silly roles. Perhaps not too different from how Tom Hanks started, on TV in ""Bosom Buddies."" But here Reynolds has to carry the movie in a comedic dramatic role and does it well.",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2008,tavm,8," Definitely, Maybe is a compelling romantic comedy for adults
","Just watched this romantic comedy-about a divorced father (Ryan Reynolds) telling his daughter (Abigail Breslin) about her potential mother from three past lovers (Rachel Wiesz, Isla Fisher, Elizabeth Banks)-with my parents. We were all amused by some lines especially some concerning Bill Clinton since Reynolds plays someone who was involved in the former president's inaugural '92 campaign who later got disillusioned by his later scandal concerning Monica Lewinsky. There's even a sight of a Clinton lookalike jogging with his men in a later scene. Besides the players I just mentioned, there's also Kevin Kline who plays an grizzly author who is also involved in Wiesz's character. They all enact their characters in a compellingly believable fashion and while some may be alarmed with Ms. Breslin (who's 11 here) saying words like ""penis"" and ""vagina"" especially having come from a sex education class, it at least gets the Reynolds character to be a little honest about his relationships from before she was born though he stops when she asks what ""threesome"" means! And Ms. Fisher is the best of the three women in the flashback scenes as her character exposes her venerability as compared to her previous role in Wedding Crashers. So for anyone looking for a more adult romcom, I highly recommend Definitely, Maybe.",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2008,inkblot11,8," Definitely a winner, there is no maybe about it, but do not expect a laughfest, as some tears may arrive on your face
","Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds) is on the verge of divorce. The papers arrive at his advertising office, where he has just been lauded for a winning sales pitch. Thus, it is a bittersweet moment. What really matters to Will is his much-cherished daughter, Maya (Abigail Breslin) and the portions of the week that he is now alloted to spend with her. As it is his day to pick her up at school and keep her overnight, Will enters the school building to find it in chaos. His daughter's class has just had a sex education lesson and everyone is in an uproar, shouting out anatomical bits of vocabulary and wondering if their parents ""do it."" As he takes Maya home, the conversation turns more to love than love-making and Will decides to tell Abigail the story of how he met her mother. But, since the tale involves a couple of past girlfriends, too, it becomes what Maya calls a love-story mystery. It seems Will worked on a political campaign in New York City, leaving one girlfriend, Emily (Elizabeth Banks) behind in Wisconsin, though they swore allegiance to each other. From there, he met a free-spirited campaign worker, April (Isla Fisher) and a political writer named Summer (Rachel Weisz). So, which one became Maya's mother, after years of love, laughter, and tears? This is a very nice film, full of romance, humor, relevance, and reality. The path to true love is sometimes quite rocky, as it is here, and it is possible to have more than one ""great"" amour in a lifetime. Reynolds, a first-rate comedian (see the delightful Just Friends), proves here that he is capable in handling dramatic material, too, and charming Breslin continues to show why she is one of the most lauded child stars ever. Banks, although quite pretty, doesn't stick out in a crowded field of women, but Weisz is very attractive and distinctive in her role as the writer while Fisher shines brightly as one of life's funny, vagabond princesses with a huge heart. The rest of the cast, including the fine Derek Luke, is well chosen. In my view, too, you will love the costumes, the scenery in and around Manhattan, and the polished look of the film, as well as the winning script and direction. All in all, this is a definite winner, not a maybe hit. Therefore, take appropriate action and get thyself to a theater soon. Oh, and watch out for the very creative opening credits, where the use of revolving montages and lettering, all done to Sly and the Family's Stone's Everday People, is most impressive.",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2008,Etrival,10," I Definitely liked this movie, and Maybe you should watch it.

4 September 2008,siderite,8," A nice romance story that doesn't have to be a comedy
","Aren't you tired of all those romcoms with the guy and the girl and the comic relief when it gets too close to reality? Fortunately, this movie is not one of those. It is a romantic life time-line from the viewpoint of one guy, telling the story to his nagging preteen daughter.",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2011,lerkim,9," A Somewhat short version of ""How I Met Your Mother"" done in romance all the way!
","Once again I am here to give a review, and this time it is Definitely, Maybe, a movie that I in the beginning wasn't sure of, some of you may know I am not a huge Ryan Reynolds fan, but I got to be honest, with the movies that he has been in over the last years I have slowly began to grow fund of his acting, this is one of those movies, one that surprises me.",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2011,clevelander,7," A better example of the genre
","If you were looking for an evening in (or out) watching a romcom (and don't we all feel that that sometimes), choose this one above some of the more well known and popular examples. It's well-crafted and tries hard to avoid many of the well-known clichés. Plenty of twist and turns: sentimentality, yes, but not laid on with a table-knife rather than a trowel. Admittedly not quite Harry met Sally or Annie Hall, as, though competently acted, the characters are still romcom cyphers. But marvel at the script-writers' solid achievement of entertainment and engagement. Competent production values keep it rolling along to the last second, without padding. If it had just added those witty little touches of human observation that characterise a great movie it might have made it into my ""8"" rating, reserved for films that have something outstanding.",/review/rw2443896/?ref_=tt_urv
