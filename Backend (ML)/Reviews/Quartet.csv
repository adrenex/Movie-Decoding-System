30 April 2012,kidsonfirebro,7," Reality TV just got real..
","At first I'd cringe when they'd show the preview for ""Duck Dynasty."" I thought it would be a rather pointless show that would serve no real purpose other than to entertain us with ""redneck millionaires."" However, that was before I gave it a chance. Duck Dynasty presents you with comedy, drama,life lessons and life challenges all packed into one 30 minute show. While some may not always agree with the ethics of the Robertson family, you can't deny that they're anything short of 'good people.' If you watch this show without being too critical you'll have an endless supply of funny moments. Don't judge this show because the life style of the Robertson family, much like others have. Judge the show from an unbiased view. ""Is this show funny and entertaining?"" You don't have to look to hard to find the answer to that question.",/review/rw2594246/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2013,joemuseum,1," Fake Reality at It's Worst
","After the gay bashing and racist remarks that were used as a nationwide publicity stunt, the whole yuppie lifestyle these characters led before they grew long beards and pretended to represent a fake lifestyle was exposed and this virtually washed away any pretense to being reality. There really is nothing left to say except that the idea that A&E and other ""educational"" networks would someday make PBS redundant was also washed away with the public display of homophobia and racism that captured the public attention in late 2013. A&E took the extreme step of firing a member of the show and then decided that, regardless of what they had previously decided, everything could just be a publicity stunt to garner more viewers, and they rehired him. Reality television has yet to go though something akin to the game show scandals of the 1950's. Perhaps the nation is ignorant enough that it never will.",/review/rw2594246/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2014,wmiller6381,3," Just Doesn't Do It For Me
","Many of my neighbors wear Duck Dynasty T-Shirts, my son's teacher gave him a Duck Dynasty coloring sheet to work on in his free time, and the local stores all have Duck Dynasty-related items for sale. As someone who tries to be fair, I gave the show a chance. The first time I watched it, the boys were sitting around talking about ice cream and apparently about how to motivate each other to actually do some work. Then one of them made a crack about preferring chunky women to skinny women. Then there was a prayer. Next episode they were out shooting some birds, then they cut to some apparently humorous remarks by one son about another bearded member of the family. Commercial break. Prayer. If you don't really care about minor aspects of T.V. entertainment such as writing, plot, character development and plausibility, this is the show for you.",/review/rw2594246/?ref_=tt_urv

","What can I say about this ""reality"" show? I could say the it is an embarrassment to every self-respecting citizen of the country these red neck cretins claim to be from (although without subtitles, how could you tell?). I could say that the Robertson's are one of the most intelligent families in the country since they have found a sure fire way of extracting millions from the lowest(in intelligence and economic status) element. I could say that this show represents everything that has gone wrong in the entertainment industry in the last several years. I could say that people who watch the show just get off on watching others humiliate and demean themselves (but that would be indicative the the viewer not the show). I could say that the fact that millions watch this show every week means that Armageddon can not be far away. Or, I could just look at the content, spelling, and grammar of the reviews of those that gave the show 10 stars and hope that the next generation raises the bar up out of the mud.",/review/rw2594246/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have never hunted a day in my life, but saw the commercials for this show and watched the first episode just because it looked kind of funny to me. Well, since that first episode, I look forward to Wednesday night's more than any other night and cannot wait to watch every week! My entire family watches the show, and we all laugh and have a great time. I don't care if it is not all real, or if it is fake, I don't care. It is a great show, with a message at the end and throughout the course of the entire show. Jase and Si crack me up every week, and I find myself saying HEY and ending my statements with JACK a lot more often than before! It is a great show that puts the meaning of family first. It is our favorite show on TV and I am quite sad the season finale is already here this week. Bring this back for many seasons to come, we will be watching! Thank you.",/review/rw2594246/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2015,wes-connors,1," And Here's to You, Mr. Robertson
","This reality series focusing on Louisiana multi-millionaires in Z.Z. Top drag is one of the worst US air-wave polluters. ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" was much more fun. Surpassing Willie Robertson as leader is patriarchal papa Phil. Calling himself a Bible-believing and gun-carrying Capitalist, Mr. Robertson has also become a Conservative folk hero. Bolstering his on-screen pontificating with off-screen pearls of wisdom, he has used both arenas to assert rights he finds in the US Constitution and Christian Bible. ""The pursuit of happiness"" does not include same-sex coupling, which Robertson finds repulsive. Diseases like AIDS are God's punishment for sinful sexual behavior, he declares...",/review/rw2594246/?ref_=tt_urv

","I watched this once. That was enough. I really dislike all reality TV. Cancel all series. When I was growing up you had 4 choices: wild kingdom, Jacques Cousteau, real people and that's incredible. I am tired of pawn guys, house guys, dancing, singing, cars guys, etc. . I remember I would watch a limited amount and be satisfied. Please put old cartoons, the Bowery boys, serials, anything but reality TV. It is very annoying and boring. Also rerun the million dollar movie. Does anybody remember that? Remember the talk shows that had tact, taste, were intelligent and dealt with important topics with guests that had recognizable names? I used to watch David susskind, David frost, dick cavett. Not the hosts of today. Too bad they don't have a school for possible talk show hosts!",/review/rw2594246/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I first heard about this show, I was looking forward to it, but after just a couple of episodes, I was just embarrassed. The show plays to the lowest common denominator of what people think a 'redneck' is, and if the show and the events therein are not entirely scripted (which is not uncommon for a LOT of 'reality' shows), then this show has managed to find some of the biggest morons on the planet. And what's worse, is apparently, that's what the TV audience wants to see (judging from all the similar 'reality' shows on TV that are full of nothing but the dumbest people on the planet screaming at each other or doing things that are beyond stupid). I was sorely disappointed with the show.",/review/rw2594246/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2014,asascy,1," Stopped watching
","I watched for awhile and it was funny, at first.....but then after watching quite a few episodes, I began to see how fake this really is. The actions of these folks, even in the show, are not really acceptable. You don't show church scenes and then trespass on the local golf course to hunt frogs, same with invading the neighbors property to go fishing and then have Phil run off like a coward so he won't fess up to trespassing. And when Phil treated his own grandson so rudely by giving everyone else jam and not him, simply cos he was cutting up and having fun. DISGUSTING. Done with DUCK DYNASTY. They may paraphrase the Bible (kind of give their own version as opposed to actually quoting FROM THE BIBLE), but they sure do not live it, not even publicly. So, I am offended that they live a Do as I say and not as I do existence. Just done with it.",/review/rw2594246/?ref_=tt_urv

","At first I thought the worst about the show, judging before watching. Unfortunately I waited till the show replayed all the episodes at once, to finally catch one. Now I am HOOKED! My husband HATES reality TV shows BUT once he started watching he was hooked to. I hope they come back for a second season! This is really, really good show. Just sad because I did not support it from the start. The old saying is true ""Can't always Judge a Book/Show by it's Cover!"" I really hope there will be a Season 2, I will add the title to my DVR list :) The family is so close, and the way that they run the business cracks me up. They take pride in what they do but they never forget where they came from. The whole family makes the show so interesting, all of them add a unique quality to the show that makes you want to come back for more.

The Show when Jase takes Willie's RV on a road trip to the BIG CITY, i almost busted from laughing so much when Uncle Si could no longer take the smells from the other travelers.

","I guess there are two sides to every situation, on one side you have the folks that see this as an adorable program showing Christian hillbillies having fun and being, well, hillbillies. On the other side you have the folks that see this as a fake, set-up, poorly written, sophomoric tale of a family that will do and say anything to keep their show on TV so people will buy their shirts, sunglasses, beach towels, cups etc etc. I first watched the show to see how they made duck calls and worked hard to make it to the top of the pack in the duck call industry (I am not kidding), well I sure was taken for a ride on that assumption. I don't think they ever actually work on the show at all, I cannot see any of these brothers, uncle, co-workers doing anything but doing and saying what the writers and producers have paid them for. That, in my opinion, is just boring, you can see right off the bat that no one in their right mind would do the stuff that is portrayed on this show unless there was cash involved .... Reality TV ?
