","'The Dreamers' is Bernardo Bertolucci's bizarre and fascinating (if not altogether successful) distillation of the radical '60's mentality. Since the film is set in Paris in 1968, the radicalism naturally takes the form of perverted sexuality and extreme cinephilia. Leave it to the French to be exploring l'amour in all its myriad possibilities!",/review/rw1483114/?ref_=tt_urv

23 July 2004,fdpedro,," Cinema, sex, politics, and Bertolucci...
","Some people think Bernardo Bertolucci could be placed among Italy's other great directors such as Fellini, Leone, or DeSica. But there are still people out there who never forgave him from LITTLE BUDDHA, or that thought LAST TANGO IN Paris was overrated soft-core porn. His latest film, THE DREAMERS, might be misunderstood as a film about the 1968 student riots in Paris. It's not. Instead, it uses 1968 Paris as a backdrop for the triangular relationship of a naïve American with a pair of incestuous French twins. ",/review/rw1483114/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2019,Bored_Dragon,10," How I fell in love with Eva Green
","Bernardo Bertolucci has always been one of my favorite directors, but with this film, he bought me for all time. ""The Dreamers"" is a film that I saw many times and I've never found the strength nor found the right words to describe and analyze it. This is an example of movie magic, and magic cannot be explained. Or maybe I do not want to try, fearing that by analyzing I could spoil my love for this movie. A strong story, perfect atmosphere, great music and a very good feeling for details. ""The Dreamers"" is full of references to many famous movies and, as my movie experience grows with years, every time I watch it the experience is getting stronger. Eva Green is fantastic and it's hard to believe that this is her first movie role. I'd be lying if I said that her nudity and sex scenes had no influence, but mostly I was fascinated by her overall appearance and a powerful presence on the screen, and this fascination holds me for fifteen years. The first cadre of the scene where she mimics Venus de Milo is one of the most beautiful erotic photographs I have ever seen.",/review/rw1483114/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2004,=G=,7," A Bertolucci pet project
","""The Dreamers"" is all about three young adult upscale hippy types who languish in a flat in Paris in the late 60's and talk about cinema, politics, sex, and other stuff while sharing some first experiences. Two are brother (Garrel) and sister (Green) identical twins (or so we're told) who have an almost metaphysical bond and the third is an interloper (Pitt) who falls in lust with the sister. There's little plot to this slice of young adult life flick which seems to be more of a Bertolucci pet project than a commercial product for the masses. Less than engaging and much less than compelling, ""The Dreamers"" immerses itself in the esoterics of the place and time to the exclusion of anyone who wasn't there then. Beautifully filmed and masterfully crafted with some young actors doing superb work under difficult circumstances with plenty of graphic nudity and sex, ""The Dreamers"" will play best with aficionados of French cinema, Bertolucci fans, etc. Those who are squeamish about sex/nudity should pass. All others, be prepared for a marginally interesting watch. (B)",/review/rw1483114/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2004,Alex_52,," Sex, Cinema, Politics - A True Molotov Cocktail
","The decor for The Dreamers, Bertolucci's sensual and narcotic film is represented by effervescent moments that took place in Paris in 1968. In the same manner in which the house inhabited by the three main protagonists represents a character, so do the Parisian streets, with their trepidation and demonstrations. Contrary to other films directed by this director - who has promised much and delivered even more throughout his career - The Dreamers opens in a fast-paced and provocative manner. The director establishes the cinematic convention precisely, eloquently, and elegantly. It becomes clear that the film deals with furious and beautiful young people who live through the films they devour. In the first five minutes, the heroine of the picture (played impeccably by Eva Green, a theatre actress reminiscent of Isabella Rossellini) announces that she was born in 1959. Logically, it is impossible, seeing that the year is 1968 and she seems to be at least 19 years old. Therefore, she explains further: 1959, Champs-Elysee, where she yelled ""New York Herald Tribune!"" Suddenly the film cuts to a scene from the classic Breathless (A bout de soufflé) by Godard, where Belmondo's feminine partner sells American newspapers on Champs-Elysee. Consequently, Bertolucci's feminine character believes that she has not been alive until seeing the afore-mentioned film, considered by many the beginning of the New Wave. The idea of interposing images and references to classic films is augmented in The Dreamers. It becomes a means of communication between the characters and in fact it ignites the entire ""action"" of the film.",/review/rw1483114/?ref_=tt_urv

24 July 2011,moonspinner55,2," Let's Face the Music and Dance...a great deal of dancing, but not much facing the music
","An American student, studying French abroad in 1968, attends the Cinematheque festival in Paris and becomes involved with incestuous brother and sister twins--both of whom profess to know a great deal about film, yet spent far more time dallying together in the nude. Screenwriter Gilbert Adair, adapting his novel ""The Holy Innocents"", seems to have concocted a sexually-twisted variation on ""Jules and Jim"", though the banal end results aren't even that inspired, really. Director Bernardo Bertolucci attempts a (winking) correlation between cinema and ""real life"", but a juxtaposition of the two might have been the more thoughtful approach (especially since reality to these children represents nothing more than facile desires). When did Bertolucci go from exploring the sexual psyches of grown-ups to the bare-bottom romps of petulant, wet-lipped, masturbatory teenagers? In the central role, young Michael Pitt cannot escape his physical resemblance to Leonardo DiCaprio, and his weakly-agitated performance destroys whatever illusions Bertolucci may have had in creating a sedative amalgam of politics, sex, and the movies. Fabio Cianchetti's cinematography is beautiful, though even he can't disguise the ciphers at the center. *1/2 from ****",/review/rw1483114/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2005,hokeybutt,6," From Sexual Hedonism To Political Activism
","THE DREAMERS (3 outta 5 stars) Interesting project by the renowned director Bernardo Bertolucci... dealing with the events of 1968 in France... a time of great social upheaval, as rioting students took to the streets to shut down the French government. The main characters are a young American student who has come to France to study film... and a very unconventional brother and sister who recruit him to their offbeat lifestyle. All three are obsessed by film (as many young people were in 1968... the glory days of the avant garde)... and also with the concept of breaking rules and societal taboos. With their parents away for the month and the flat to themselves, bets are made on film trivia and the penalties for not identifying a particular moment from a particular film become more and more shocking. Only leaving their home to watch films, the trio are basically oblivious to the growing trouble in the streets... until finally they can sit passively no more. Very intriguing concept and the acting is fine... but ultimately I thought the conclusion fell a little flat... the transition from sexual hedonism to political activism didn't really work for me... it all seemed a little abrupt and could have been explored a little deeper. Worth watching and discussing though.",/review/rw1483114/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2006,FilmFanatic09,9," The Dreamers
","The characters of ""The Dreamers"" love movies. They pass their time quoting them, reenacting scenes from them, and debating age-old questions such as the merits of Chaplin versus Keaton. When at the cinema, they make sure to sit in the rows closest to the screen. Why? So the images will reach them before anyone else, while still fresh. If this strikes you as illogical, perhaps ""The Dreamers"" isn't the movie for you. This is a film about film lovers and will likely be most appreciated by lovers of film in return. The basic narrative follows Matthew, a young American (the boyish Michael Pitt), who is studying in Paris during the late 60s, the time of the student riots. The film does a good job of setting up the loneliness which engulfs him in this foreign place, so we are quick to understand why he so eagerly accepts the offer to stay with French twins Isabelle and Theo (Eva Green and Louis Garrel) he has met at- where else?- the cinema.

9 April 2006,nycritic,10," At Play When Adults Are Away
","An American in Paris, 1968, at the height of the turbulence following the firing of Henri Langlois, the founder of the French Cinematheque, meets a pair of fraternal twins, Isabelle and Theo, cinema buffs, sparks a friendship, gets introduced to their intellectual parents, and then are left to their own devices when the parents leave. For young college kids in Any Campus, USA, that would be like letting the cork out of a well-shaken bottle of beer: all that gold liquor would come spewing out in an orgy of bacchanalia and you'd have any combinations of American PIE, PORKY'S, and ANIMAL HOUSE. Not in Paris: these young kids are true idealists in every sense of the word; they are in complete love with the theories of cinema, directors (Theo, in one scene, quotes: ""Nicholas Ray is cinema.""), and the love of reenacting scenes from their favorite films.",/review/rw1483114/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2006,Lady_Targaryen,6," When Politics, sex, films and books are all united.....
","Based on Gilbert Adair's novel'' The Holy Innocents'', ''The Dreamers'' is a very different movie from the conventional ones I am used to watch. Isabelle and Theo, the twins, has a very intimate relationship for brothers that I don't understand very well and Matthew, their new American friend (and lover) starts to accept the way they are and fall in love with both of them. One thing I need to complain about the movie, is the hypocrisy that I read in the trivia section, saying that if they show Matthew's and Theo's relationship it might have been ""too much'' for the public, but Theo and Isabelle, that are brother and sister, can sleep together and have the most unusual behavior of all. I don't agree with that and if I needed to choose something that would ''shock'' someone, an ambiguous relationship between brothers would be much more shocking then a gay relationship.",/review/rw1483114/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2004,denizov,," Bertolucci has made a remarkable film!
","Yesterday I watched ""Dreamers"".I admit i had had prejudices about the film.I have seen ""Last tango..."" and I did not like it(check my comments about it)but this film is much more mature.Although it is about 2 hours i didn't feel bored.The shooting is brilliant,the dialogues are very well-written.All three leading actors play very emotionally and convincingly,bearing in mind their youth and relative inexperience.There are many aspects of life mixed in this film and analyzed deeply and intelligently:coming of age,America vs.France in the field of culture,history(the riots and complexities of 1968 Paris revolution),the radicalism of young people and their uneasy relations with their parents and of course the phenomenon of cinema(not only the pluses of it but its minuses too)I admire Bertolucci's bravery in putting this aspect of cinema as a problem to be discussed-that sometimes cinema not so much REFLECTS life rather than REPLACES it.Even Isabelle's attempted suicide is theatrical and indeed the brother and sister's infatuation with cinema prevents them from growing into mature personalities,from leading a more""real"" life.This film is so rich and complex that it should be a subject of a medium article and not just of a comment like this one.I would rate it 7 out of 10.I would have given an even higher mark had it not been about the incest theme which I find superfluous and disgusting and ultimately unnecessary and had it not been on the too-graphic to my taste sexual scenes and showing of male and female genitalia.Here in Bulgaria it is not recommended for people under 16 which I think is correct as young people may accept this film in a wrong way. I am sure this film will be perceived as one of the most interesting artistic achievements of the last several years.",/review/rw1483114/?ref_=tt_urv

","In the summer of 1968 American student Matthew is in Paris; he is spending a year there to improve his French; he is also a cinephile, spending much of his time at the Cinémathèque Française watching films old and new. Also attending are twins Isabelle and Theo although they don't talk to each other until the man in charge of the cinema is fired leading to protests by his supporters. During the protest Matthew gets talking to Isabelle and later gets invited home for dinner. It is raining so he ends up spending the night in the spare room. The next day Isabelle and Theo's parents depart for a month long holiday and the twins invite him to stay. It is clear that Isabelle and Theo aren't like most twins; they have a relationship that is almost incestuous. They spend their time discussing films, enacting scenes from films for the others to guess and when they can't expecting them to perform forfeits of a sexual nature. It is one such forfeit that begins Isabelle and Matthew's sexual relationship. While this is going on the city is in turmoil but the trio barely notice as they are so wrapped up in their own world.",/review/rw1483114/?ref_=tt_urv

Sometimes they become casualties of the expectation generated by their reputations; a case in point the fiasco of Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"".
