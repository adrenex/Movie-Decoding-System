10 October 2003,zakal,," What was FOX thinking?!
","FOX must have the greatest talent scouts in the world, but the worst executives.  ""Firefly"" is the best example.  It was simultaneously the best new show, the best western series in decades, and the best sci-fi show on TV (and coming from a die-hard Trekkie, placing them above ""Enterprise"" is saying something).  They didn't have a single bad episode, and some were spectacular.  The premise, the characters, the plots and the dialogue were all top-notch.  And FOX cancelled it without even really giving it a chance.",/review/rw0847838/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," One of the biggest mistakes FOX ever made was cancelling this wonderful show!
","Right from the start of Firefly, I was hooked to the show and I consider one of the very best sci-shows I've seen. Although I could find little to fault it, it had even more room to progress. But guess what? Like others have said and justly so in my opinion, FOX made one of the worst decisions they ever made and cancelled Firefly after just one year! It just saddens me that this jewel gets cancelled and there is rubbish still airing that should not be. The series looks absolutely wonderful, with the photography, effects and settings paid a lot of detail to, and the writing is intelligently compelling. There may be the odd questionable logical lapse(but to be honest I have seen much worse), but to me because of how much the stories draw me in it very rarely bothers me. The acting is fine, especially from Nathan Fillion, and the music is very memorable and fitting with the atmosphere that is conveyed. In conclusion, a wonderful show that fell victim to a terrible mistake on FOX's part. 10/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw0847838/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2006,film-critic,," If you can't run, you crawl, and if you can't do that...
","Firefly is like no other television program. Only lasting one year, with episodes randomly thrown on strange nights on FOX, this series boasted a classic combination of science fiction with a western flair. How could it go wrong? A humorous program that had fun, fought bad guys, and harbored extremely dark secrets. Why did it only last one season? Marketing. FOX, as we all can learn from my review of Outfoxed, is not quite the ""fair and balanced"" type of programming that it promotes, but instead attaches itself to the hottest trend and pushes it nearly to the point of sickness. For those that would disagree, I ask you to check out how many predictable seasons of American Idol we will have to endure until someone realizes that it lost its steam a many a moon ago. Or how about the disaster of a series called Wife Swap? Honestly, did FOX just ignore the idea of creativity and push directly for insulting ""reality"" television? From what I see on television today, I could only assume the answer to be ""yes"". Firefly was a bold, unique, and highly original series that gave us powerful characters, detailed stories, and that Lost itch in the back of your mind that keeps you asking that age old question, ""why"". Yet, in all of its power, it was canceled.",/review/rw0847838/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2004,littlemissknowitall,10," Could have been great
","As with BtVS, the world is divided into people who get Firefly and people who don't. In this series Joss Whedon created one of the most realistic post-war visions of the future ever committed to tape, that at the same time spoke about yesterday and today. Maybe a little too much today for its own good.",/review/rw0847838/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2003,dysamoria,," Another series canceled for lack of simple-minded stupidity
","Series creator Joss Whedon took a somewhat familiar concept (science fiction as the new ""wild west frontier"") and freshened it up with a lively, chemistry-rich cast of characters, a richly detailed, plausible and interesting social setting, a dash of excitement, classic science fiction ""find the better part of humanity"" ideals, a goal to avoid or make light of most of the tired and worn-out genre cliches and a  fantastic production team.  The resulting product?  An excellent piece of original artful entertainment that was a breath of fresh air in the stagnating science fiction scene on television (or anywhere else).",/review/rw0847838/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2004,Rabit,10," Beautifully crafted and enjoyable series
","This show blew me away. The beauty of the production, the detail in the sets, the well written characters, the intelligent stories and concepts, the fun, the drama, and the excitement all amazed me. I don't usually spend time watching TV, but I honestly hated having to wait until the next show! :)",/review/rw0847838/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2004,anubis1138,10," The Man They Call Jayne
","Firefly was easily the best sci fi show Fox developed aside from the X-Files. It had science fiction staples spaceships, laser pistols, and tech, but also a nice retro quality of frontier western speech, horses, and guns. The humor alone made this one of the best shows on television. The Joss Whedon ability to spin a familiar plot convention/line in a surprising direction and the top notch cast of talented and charismatic actors help make this cancelled science fiction Fox casualty a cult favorite and upcoming movie. While the discussion about why it was cancelled and who was to blame is up for debate, no one can argue 200,000 in DVD secondary market sales to date. Clearly, Firefly was a show that deserved a chance to shine and with it's incarnation next year as a film, will allow this phoenix to rise again.",/review/rw0847838/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2004,Welsh_Corgie,," Counterpoint, apparently
","Comparable in flavor to critically-acclaimed Cowboy Bebop. If you're one of the many people that enjoy a good, character-driven show, with a decent plotline and writing hand-crafted by some of the finest in the business, then this is the show for you. Apparently so for the Fox network, but only for a few weeks. Thankfully, the show was released in its entirety on DVD, in all of its glory. Also, as if the brilliant episodes weren't enough to satisfy, there are great, insightful commentaries on most episodes, by creator Joss Whedon and others, and lots of other extras. I can't say enough about this show. Everyone was sad to see this show go, especially the stars.",/review/rw0847838/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2018,nancyldraper,10," One of the best TV series ever made
","To my tastes, this in one of the best TV Series ever made. It's Joss Whedon. The casting is perfect. The writing is imaginative, witty, and it explores the nobility and fallibility of humanity. It gave us beloved characters with depth and relationships for which we rooted. The production values were ahead of it's time. The music was perfect. And, that perfect cast gave perfect performances. Pretty high praise for a 14 episode, one season series, released incomplete and out of order by the network (for more on the tortured and redemptive journey of the series read it's Wikipedia page). This is probably my third time through the series and I bought the DVDs so, needless to say, this show is on My Top 20 TV Series list, and I give it a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {Space Western}",/review/rw0847838/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2007,kosmasp,10," Western or Sci-Fi? Both and good at it!
",Nathan Fillion as Capt. Reynolds is probably one of the coolest characters to grace your TV screen ... although he wasn't there long enough for you to enjoy him. And it's a shame that the show got axed so early.,/review/rw0847838/?ref_=tt_urv

20 May 2004,nchanter,," addicting
","I felt I had to comment on this show because of another persons negative opinion on it(target audience of 8 or 9 years). I find this show addicting and the characters far more interesting than many sci-fi shows that have gained far more publicity because of their special effects. Each character is very well developed and entices the audience to want to find out more about them. As a personal response as to why weapons haven't developed beyond the space western....several of the episodes show scenes of past and current technology far more advanced than the weapons used in the show on a regular basis.laser guns,magnetic grapplers,floating cities,multiple brain surgeries involving nerve manipulation,killer sonic tech,and much more. The show is set on the frontier of known space with characters that are not rich. A regular western gun is all that can be safely used on a spaceship. Another gun, whether laser or high caliber projectile weapon will pierce the hull and cause major problems for the crew..if not kill them outright.",/review/rw0847838/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2018,dubwize,10," Original, Unique and timeless

19 March 2019,ChubbyChecker,10," Whedon's masterpiece
","Sure, Buffy was great, there's no disputing that. Firefly though, that show is what showed us that Whedon really knows his stuff. How to build a setting, how to build a great ensemble cast, how to tell a story that people really care about.",/review/rw0847838/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2004,securis,," Excellent Series
","This series is an excellent series.  However, like other high quality shows, this one was cancelled prematurely.  Science fiction often takes time for people to warm upto it, but in the end, the fanbase makes up for the time lost. (Stargate SG-1 was tossed around from HBO to Fox and now to SciFi where it is now the hottest scifi show on television) The magnitude of Star Trek: The Original Series was not realized until it was prematurely cancelled.  Look at the money Paramount is making off of the franchise. This show is like many others who deserve recognition in science fiction. I recommend anyone who appreciates science fiction to watch this series, however, I must warn you that the ending is exceptionally disappointing. It is unfinished... an abrupt ending with so many lose ends, it may leave you with a feeling of grave disappointment when you realize there's no more episodes to watch... when everything that has been building up in suspense comes to nothing. Networks sure know how to get people to stop watching TV... cancel anything of any value.",/review/rw0847838/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2019,God_is_with_us,10," Must watch
","I really enjoy watching this television show. It was very insightful and the context was what I feel is what Hollywood Lost sight of. In these episodes they focused on quality character and content of history, rather than getting it on and getting the business done.",/review/rw0847838/?ref_=tt_urv

29 August 2004,feelinglistless,," The following review contains moments of total jabbering incoherence. You have been warned.
","Firefly. Where do I begin. There are times, now and then, when something new arrives, be it music, painting, scientific discovery, film or TV which just makes me take a step back (metaphoric or otherwise) and go - 'Ooooh!' Something is so good, so in-tune, that it sucks me in and creates an indefinable something which is impossible to put into words without sounding like either a pretentious idiot or a yabbering nutcase. Without a doubt it is one of the best pieces of television ever created and the heartbreaking thing is no one but a few interested souls have seen it. This should have been as important a step in TV terms as The X-Files, or before that Hill Street Blues. Instead it was cancelled before anyone got a chance to see it.",/review/rw0847838/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2004,goddessh,," Strangely Intriguing
","I have to admit, I had serious doubts about this show. I hate westerns, and a sci-fi/western combination sounded like a really bad show concept--especially since the most recognizable actor in the show was a guy who had a minor part in Two Guys, A Girl, and A Pizza Place (itself a pretty forgettable show). But I found myself getting drawn into this series very quickly. It is very witty, as well as suspenseful. The characters are a lot of fun, too. It is definitely a little quirkier than most of the shows out there, but is that really a bad thing? I loved the banter, loved the acting, and was very disappointed to watch the last episode last night. This show deserved better than to be canceled in the middle of its first run. I'm guessing that the humor was too high-brow for most of the TV watchers of the world.",/review/rw0847838/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2018,vatigue,10," Serenity
","This is probably going to be my one and only 10/10 review.
Living in Switzerland, I stumbled upon a serenity-dvd which turned out to be some pretty funny and entertaining sci-fi-western mixup.
I never heard of Firefly or even Joss Whedon before (having watched the famous Buffy or Angel episode-wise on tv after all). Firefly never aired in Europe.
After googling it, I figured out there was a series that precedented the movie. Downloading and watching the episodes made me really happy. I still keep rewatching Firefly after all these years at least annually. It ticked all my boxes when it comes to humor, sci-fi and western back in the days and still does now. Much like Cowboy Bebop did when i discovered that. It's my genre kindof and I really cannot get enough of it. The cast works awesomely together and there is no boring episode at all througought. Masterpiece imho, but of course comes down to what you like to watch after all. If you do like your share of sci-fi-western comedy with witty dialoge and no stupid behaviour for a change, that's the thing you are looking for. It didn't age well over the years CGI-wise but I cannot recommend it enough.",/review/rw0847838/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2018,Cool-Lion14,8," Joss Whedon's best work!
","I did not catch Firefly when it first came on TV and it wasn't until later I'd heard about the 2005 film Serenity. But that movie introduced me to the world of Firefly and got me interested. Spaceships and human-occupied planets in a totalitarian system and (unlike some sci-fi outings) no lightsabers, phasers, replicators, aliens, or space battles. Just a makeshift family onboard a single ship looking to survive and live to see a better tomorrow. The cast really took home the gold and my favorites include Jayne, Mal, River, Zoe, and Wash. They, along with the others make such a fine crew. And it's about cowboys who travel in space. Think spaghetti westerns crossed with sci-fi and that's Firefly. Plus, the characters have chemistry. This show should have stayed on longer but at least now we got a comic book continuation that takes place after the 2005 film. If you're tired of vampires and demons, take a look at this.",/review/rw0847838/?ref_=tt_urv
