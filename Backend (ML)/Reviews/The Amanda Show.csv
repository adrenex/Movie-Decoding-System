6 May 2010,TxMike,," Story very similar to the first, but with different characters. I enjoyed it.
","In 'Blue Lagoon' the movie ends with the young couple and their baby adrift at sea as a boat approaches. We don't really know what happened or if they survived. This movie, ""Return"", takes up where that one ended, somewhere in the Pacific, in the late 1800s.",/review/rw3785362/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2001,rlcsljo,6," Not quite as good as the original, but interesting
","This film wasted too much time trying to get our heroes back to the island and the first half of the flick was almost an exact repeat of the same sequence in the first.  I really wanted to see the grow up again and not just see how they got lost--which was pretty standard in both films.  Of course the two castaways had to ""rediscover"" their sexuality--this is what this film is about.  The movie really changes into high gear when the children are re-introduced to civilization.",/review/rw3785362/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2013,Leofwine_draca,4," Lukewarm leftovers
","RETURN TO THE BLUE LAGOON, made 11 years after the successful first film, is one of those movies that's happy to reprise the plot of the original while adding a few twists and tweaks of its own. It's an entirely superfluous kind of film that sees yet another couple of kids washed up on a desert island and having to fend for themselves against nature and their fellow man.",/review/rw3785362/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Blue Lagoon was a silent success with the audiences of 1980, not to mention one of the most controversial movies of all time. So, I guess the director just wanted to have the same amount of success, so he used the same story, just different characters.",/review/rw3785362/?ref_=tt_urv

","going into this movie, i didn't have expectations of great acting or a phenomenal script. i had never even heard of it or The Blue Lagoon until a few weeks ago because people only talk about the really great movies.",/review/rw3785362/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2011,Demonicaura,9," Wonderful sequel to a good movie
","I had never even heard about the blue lagoon movies until about a year ago. After finding out that shields was in the first movie I thought that it might be kind of interesting since she was one of my favorite actresses however after finding out that there was underage nudity in it my first though was ""how could this be legal"" since my understanding was the underage nudity was not legal in the united states. I put that  thought aside and decided to watch the movie anyway. After watching it I Saw just how innocent the nudity really was. There was nothing sexual at all about it. About a month or so after watching the original blue lagoon I found out that there was a sequel and that this one had mila jovovich  in it, another actress of whom I knew from the resident evil  series. I figured that this one might be just a good as the first one and for the most part it was. I mean don't get me wrong this was a wonderful movie and the story line was well thought out but the innocents that we saw from the first movie was taken away. In the first movie they grew up not knowing about puberty, pregnancy, and what your body goes though during that time. In this movie both of the young children were educated about the changes that their bodies would go through when they hit the age of puberty. If you put that aside and just watch both movies you will see that they are both great movies to watch. I personally cannot see how people can say that this movie or it's original with shields in it are in any way borderline child pornography. Okay so what I mean yes we do see  a frontal view of mila jovovich's breasts and she was only like 15 or so in this movie and during the first twenty minutes or so there are numerous scenes in which we see a frontal shot of young Courtney barilla who is only like 8 or 9 at the time but it's not like it is  anything that we've never seen growing up so I personally cannot see how people are so bent out of shape about seeing it in the movies but to each their own. Putting that aside both the original and it's sequel were great movies and their story lines were well thought out. They are both worth seeing and in my opinion are a perfect family movie for all ages. Younger children might not fully understand what is going on in the movie and parents might have to explain some things but both movies are family oriented.",/review/rw3785362/?ref_=tt_urv

31 May 2020,rivertam26,8," One of my all time faves
","I feel like I shouldn't love this movie but I do. I wasn't a big fan of the original film a found it a tad boring and depressing bit I loved this sequel. It's more hopeful and engaging. Picking up right after the first film's events. The boat is found by a passing ship and only the baby has survived. The only woman on board takes charge of young Richard until suddenly they are forced off board with another crewmember, her daughter and Richard because there is an outbreak of cholera. After days at sea with no hope the crewmember tries to throw the children overboard and she kills him. Soon after they arrive at the island from the first film and grow into a handsome Brian Krause (Sleepwalkers) and the gorgeous Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil). Along the way incidents happen and soon enough they are faced with civilization. It's all dramatically engaging, romantic and suspenseful at times. It all moves forward towards a thrilling climax. The movie is shot gorgeously with solid performances. It still holds up as a intriguing romantic adventure.",/review/rw3785362/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2016,Kirpianuscus,," Milla Jovovich
","she is, maybe, the only motif to see the film. not exactly for performance but for the simple presence. bodies, feelings, discover of the aspects of life by innocent young people out of civilization. and the classic question - is it useful ? the no is not reasonable in same measure like the yes. because it is a decent film who reminds more than could present. because Brian Krause is obvious not the most inspired option. because something seems be too strange and the acting or script are not the tools to repair the errors. because it is a story for each generation and after a decade, its reinvent could be a not bad idea. because it is, obvious, an exercise. and nothing more. to reinvent an universe. to suggest a state.this is all.",/review/rw3785362/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2004,TheOtherFool,5," Likable to a point
","The first Blue Lagoon was one of the worst movies of all time, and I actually liked this one better. The acting seemed a lot more convincing, in particular if you compare Milla Jovovich to Brooke Shields.",/review/rw3785362/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 1999,Kittenn,4," Not As Good
","I loved the original version, well, the 1980 original version, and I found this to be basically a copy which wanted to cash in on the success of the first.  The theme was basically the same, with unnecessary violence added in.",/review/rw3785362/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2004,tnt_123,8," This film rocks!
","This film was absolutely beautiful. I can't understand so many people having a problem with it. Everybody says its horrible, why, what is so horrible about it? It made me wanna become more natural and relaxed, knowing that nature is truth and purity while civilization is corruption and a lie. This movie is definitely for Milla Jovovich and Brian Krause fans. Milla's acting seems very inexperienced and like she doesn't care about it, but that actually makes her seem more natural, although I wish she would be more professional. Brian Krause does an average job, but again when you watch the movie the last thing you think about is how the actors act. What gets you the most about this movie is its beautiful message about how a human being should be, beautiful and pure in all ways.I definitely recommend this film.",/review/rw3785362/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2010,jonathanruano,3," Return to the Blue Lagoon -- Bad films coming full circle
","I can only think of one thing more incomprehensible than making a movie from a bad script and that is for a filmmaker to base his idea for a movie on another movie that is terrible. Normally directors try to rip off good movies, like the guy who directed ""The Italian Connection"" based on the ""The French Connection"" (good thinking because sometimes Americans confuse the French and the Italians), or the other fellow who directed the porno ""American Booty"" based on Sam Mendes' ""American Beauty."" And if all else fails, do a sequel like ""Jaws II"" based on the good ""Jaws"" or ""Exorcist II"" based on the great ""Exorcist."" I could go on, except I will be going off track and forgetting to tell you about the time when they decided to make the terrible ""Return of the Blue Lagoon"" based on the terrible ""Blue Lagoon"" which must have had the makers of sequels and rip offs scratching their heads.",/review/rw3785362/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2002,preppy-3,1," Well...the photography was nice!

28 July 2021,JamesHitchcock,3," The world needed a sequel to ""The Blue Lagoon"" like it needed a hole in the head
","How would you make a sequel to the 1980 version of ""The Blue Lagoon""? Well, my view is that the world needs a sequel to ""The Blue Lagoon"" like it needs a hole in the head, but if I were commissioned to write such a sequel and could not get out of the commission, it would go something like this. Richard and Emmeline are found alive, rescued and are taken back to civilisation, where they discover that they are heirs to a fortune. Their wealth, good looks and the remarkable tale of their survival on a desert island make them the most famous couple in America and they are in great demand everywhere in high society. They, however, hate their new lifestyle and find high society superficial, hypocritical and cruel. They quietly abandon their new life and return to their tropical island with their son to live out the rest of their days there.",/review/rw3785362/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2003,QueenMakeda84,," Disappointing
","I saw this movie before I saw The Blue Lagoon and loved it. However, I saw its predecessor and saw the flaws in this movie's plot. First off, why did they kill Richard and Emmeline at the start of the movie when they were just asleep? And they were rescued by a different person. Richard's father found them in the last one. And they expect us to believe that a child could survive being on a boat with no food more so than the parents? After seeing that, my love for the movie began to dwindle. It completely turns around the ending of the first and I adore the first movie. I like the fact that they knew a little more and still had to contend with one another alone. The visitors near the end was good too, but they chickened out and stayed on the island to be left alone with their child. What kind of future would they give it with only the kid and it's siblings? More incest I suppose till the English or French colonize the island. Either way, the music was reminiscent of the first and I liked that. This movie was just disappointing little. You don't know why, but next to the first, it really isn't as good. The actors tried their hardest, but they were no Brooke and Chris. Nice film however.",/review/rw3785362/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2011,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,5," Deserted, indeed
","The two from the first are dead(...well, that's a bummer), discovered by a ship. Soon after a woman is sent away from it with her infant daughter and the son that did survive sequelitis, and the three end up on an island paradise(and yes, we do get nice photography of the exotic setting, and it's one of the few pluses in this). After half of this passes at an utterly drab pace, the mother dies and we get what I understand is essentially a remake of the original(which I have not watched, and I also have not read any of the books), and lesser. And the last 25 minutes, because the people behind this don't dare let the two leads be by themselves, ""civilization"" in the form of a seductive girl and unappealing sailors arrives and have us questioning... who are the true savages in this? That admittedly is somewhat interesting, if ill-executed. This can be pretty moralizing at times, and it awkwardly goes back and forth between making fun of Christianity and trying to promote it. There is some realism to dialog and gender roles, if they are also stereotypical. The attempts at comedy tend to be lame and ineffective, with a few exceptions. There is some tension. The acting is fine. I like Krause even if he isn't the greatest talent, and Milla, in addition to being cute, hot, beautiful, stunning and so many other similar terms(you can probably tell why I gave this 90-some minutes of my life) is a quite decent actress, and was back then. There is a bit of sensuality and a little nudity in this. The DVD comes with trailers for both of these. I recommend this to those who want the visuals, be it the location or, like yours truly, Jovovich. 5/10",/review/rw3785362/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2005,PsychMajor726,2," What is with the movie?
","I watched this movie for the first time last year because I loved the first one. What a mistake. I agree with other comments about the plot. I don't understand why they took the parents from the first film, who were alive at the end, and made them dead in this one. I really don't understand why the sailor at the end who tries to rape Lilli looks the same as the one at the beginning who the mother kills by bludgeoning him with a spear rifle. I don't understand why if Brooke Shields, at the age of 16, wasn't allowed to bare her breasts or rear end in the first one, why Milla was allowed to, at 16 also, bare hers in the second film. I could go on and on. There are a few things I enjoy about this film though. I am a major environmentalist and I have often wondered what it would be like to live on a deserted island with only yourself and your lover to depend on for survival. I think it would teach everyone the meaning of life and help all come to grips with reality. There is beautiful photography and music, composed by Basil Poledouris (also the first film's musical composer) of course!",/review/rw3785362/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2017,deickos,8," More beauty
","In the second film though the main theme remains the same, there is more beauty to discover. Few movies are as relaxing as this one. The music of Basil Poledouris adds to the effect - it is one of the best ever written for the cinema. There are some clichés here and there but cannot mar the result. I honestly believe there must be something wrong with anyone that is not touched by the beauty in these movies.",/review/rw3785362/?ref_=tt_urv
