","Do you know that old movie rule that you subconsciously decide whether you're going to enjoy a film or not within the first ten minutes? Well, it wasn't true this time, because after the opening sequence, I was pretty sure I was going to hate ""I Am Number Four"". Thankfully, I was in for a pleasant surprise.",/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2011,DonFishies,4," Not so much a disappointment as it is deeply unsatisfying
","In a perfect world, the convoluted mess called I Am Number Four could have been great. It had all the trappings for success: based off a semi-popular novel for teens, a fairly accomplished director in D.J. Caruso, the producing ""talent"" of Michael Bay, two hot young stars in Alex Pettyfer and Glee's own Dianna Agron, and an enigmatic, yet intriguing trailer campaign. So why is it that the final product is one of the most deeply unsatisfying theatrical experiences I have had in some time? ",/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2011,Filmaholic78,6," I am another Cliché
","This is not a bad film. It's just not that great. The story feels a bit weak and there are so many plot holes it takes away part of the enjoyment. I also found myself un interested in the characters, apart from the dog, but who doesn't love a cute dog? It just seemed to be cliché after cliché after cliché. I have to remind myself I didn't go to watch shawshank redemption 2 or a William Shakespeare film adaptation. Instead I watched 90 odd minutes of blah. Good special effects and action sequences plus the added bonus of eye candy were just enough to save it. Just.",/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv

15 May 2016,atlasmb,7," A Teen-Targeted Sci-Fi Myth With Some Nice Action Scenes
","A film targeted at young adults, ""I am Number Four"" starts with some compelling action, then settles into a typical teen high school story--with budding love, the school bully, and the kid who is picked on--with a twist of mystery. The main character, John (Alex Pettyfer), has to move to another town whenever he and his guardian become too visible. They are on the run. And their pursuers are killers from another planet. He tries to fit into the new school, but new kids are misfits and they draw attention, right? ",/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv

","There are two alien races on this planet. One is trying to kill the other one. The good guys look like blond surfers and the bad guys look like Darth Maul. Three of the good guys are dead. The fourth one (4 of 9) has relocated to Paradise, Ohio and is attempting to keep a low profile, but insists on going to school. Here he meets a pretty blond who is also a photographer. There are the jocks who insist he stay away from her and the class science/UFO geek who is picked on by the Jocks.",/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2011,TheMovieMark,5," Smallville + a bigger budget + Twilight = I Am Number Four
","Based on the NY Times best-selling novel by ""Pittacus Lore"" (an alias for the memoir-fabricating James Frey and Jobie Hughes), I Am Four kicks off the cinematic proceedings with an intense and creepy jungle chase scene and an intriguing - albeit fairly unoriginal - concept.",/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2019,UniqueParticle,8," Epicness at the same time nothing special!
","Alex Pettyfer is great and so is Dianna Agron, she's precious! D.J. Caruso is an excellent director especially for Disturbia - I absolutely love that movie. I Am Number Four is mostly targeted for mid teens but still quite a cool concept and the soundtrack is bomb diggity, lol. Also Timothy Olyphant is spectacular at least in most projects, oh and of course Michael Bay was a producer just about everything he's involved in has some form over budgeted action sequences.",/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2011,dlo540,7," Exactly what I expected
","This movie isn't the best action film of the year. This movie isn't another tongue-in-cheek teen movie. Most importantly, this movie isn't a ""wannabe"" of the Twilight franchise. This movie is entertainment for all viewers that delivers a good story, action, and desire to want more at the end. I was lucky enough to work as an extra in this movie for about 2 weeks and was able to see how this film came together, piece by piece. The visual effects truly make the film enjoyable. Seeing it behind-the-scenes, I couldn't imagine what it would look like. To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised.",/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2012,The-Sarkologist,8," Pretty decent film for a pulp novel
","This is quite a strange movie and I could not determine whether it was a horror, a sci-fi, or a thriller. IMDb describes it as an Action/Sci-Fi/Thriller, though I would have to add elements of horror into this film. The horror elements is that the film is set in a small American town (though it is noticeable that main street has not yet been destroyed by Walmart) name Paradise (horror films always seem to be set in places with pleasant sounding names), the scene is generally dark and dreary, and the main characters are up against an mysterious force that is substantially more powerful than they are. Actually, a lot of films with the sci-fi moniker tend to actually be horror movies, and the only reason that they are sci-fi is because they involve aliens or futuristic scenes or technology. I am now thinking that sci-fi is not actually a genre in itself, but rather a thematic setting, since most sci-fi films will fall into action, horror, thriller, romance, and I will throw in fantasy as that is probably a genre in itself (though it is probably better classified as epic).",/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2011,claudio_carvalho,8," Highly Entertaining Adventure

23 October 2014,juneebuggy,8," Liked it even though I'm not from the target age group
","That was better than I was expecting especially since I'm not in the target age group. It has a 'Twilight'-ish feel to it with typical teenage angst, high-school issues and some light romance, but on the other side its also a pretty cool sci-fi flick with great special effects and some interesting/unique bad guys.",/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2012,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,8," I Am Number Four (2011)
","I was very pleasantly surprised by this film. In this day and age, everything is trying to be the new teen driving force of fantasy fiction. Usually focusing on an outsider that belongs to a bizarre otherworldly group. We've done wizards, vampires, and now we have aliens. I Am Number Four sees Alex Pettyfer star as a boy that must run from location to location, along with his guardian Henri. They are being hunted as they are part of an alien race wiped out on their home planet by the Mogadorian. There are 9 special kids with different powers. 3 have already been killed. Pettyfer has all the key ingredients to be a leading man. He has looks and charm, and is able to carry enough emotion when he needs to. I Am Number Four is nothing new at all, but it does do everything well. Perhaps I was in the mood for something simple. You get your clichéd high school characters, and their usual relationships. Pettyer falls fro the ex of the high school hero jock etc. Makes friends with the creepy conspiracy kid and so on. But I liked all these characters. The action was fantastic and I felt really involved. Gun battles, exciting foot chases, martial arts, and all of it filmed so you can tell precisely what is going on. It's one of those films that was exactly what I wanted at the time. I will certainly be reading the books after this.",/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2011,Meven_Stoffat,1," Twilight + Plot of Johnny Mnemonic + Cast of Twilight + Good special effects + SLIGHTLY better acting than Twilight= I Am Number Four
","I saw an advance screening of the flick tonight. The only reason I went and saw it was because my buddy had a free screening pass for 2, and it's a free screening. I remember reading the book and not being very impressed, however I can't say I can pinpoint exactly what's been left out since I had forgotten most of it. Not sure if I even care now that I've seen both ends of the spectrum.",/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2011,blacklist-1,1," I am Number Four is an absolute bore. An excruciatingly awful film.
","My god! Words cannot reiterate how terrible this movie is. I didn't go with high expectations. I didn't expect Oscar winning performances or a witty and sharp script etc. I thought if I could give it a five or a six out of ten at most I would be satisfied with some great action, good special effects and reasonable acting, but it didn't even have that. Seriously the reviewers who have given this higher than a four have seriously deluded themselves. I'm not a teenager, which this film is aiming for (but even then it's so badly made even they shouldn't like this).",/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2017,churei,8," It's well done fun....nicely executed
","I really didn't have the highest of hopes when turning this film on while the rain poured outside. BUT I was more than pleasantly surprised by the ease with which the action-packed film zipped along. Yes, it is a story of a 'loner' in search of his place in the universe (he is an alien in the US), but that internal conflict carries the story aloft with good acting (not played for Flash Gordon camp). Timothy Olyphant is a scene steal-er and a fine actor...and the younger performers are quite relaxed as they confront sci-fi trickeries at every corner.A big smile occurred with the reappearance, at the end (not really a spoiler). Don't avoid this film...it will give you a couple of enjoyable hours...and, yes, i do kinda hope that the series continues...I still want to know about the BOX!!",/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2014,Leofwine_draca,5," So, Twilight for boys. But does it work?
","The producers of I AM NUMBER FOUR made no bones about the demographic for their movie: this is, in essence, TWILIGHT aimed at teenage boys, who could identify with a high school loner character who turns out to be an alien refugee being hunted by some other aliens. The real question is whether the film manages to be successful in its own right.",/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2020,kalithor,8," Decent watch
",Still watch this. Wasn't that bad of a movie ignore the bad reviews. My biggest complaint would be the story was left open for a sequel maybe a trilogy? Will never know.,/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2011,prateak09,5," Boring besides the last 20 minutes...
","Of course, ""I Am Number Four"" is by no means a great movie. Characters are stereotypical, things fall into place way too conveniently and one has the feeling that a good junk of the original novel has just been crammed together to (barely) fit into the running time of 90 minutes. The story feels a bit weak and there are so many plot holes it takes away part of the enjoyment like if the nine aliens are so powerful, why can't they stop those Mogadorians? Is it because they have a huge flying squirrel like monster? Oh wait. Number Four also have one of those. Is it their appearance? Or is it unexplained? I've never read this book before. Lack of narratives? They never mentioned why kill them in sequence. But however, This is not a bad film. It's just not that great. Among the good points, the visuals were astounding. The final battle in the movie is something that save the movie from being a huge disappointed. The last 20 minutes will most certainly entertain the majority of audiences. And also the villains are pretty cool. There gigantic, bald, covered in tattoos with gills and sharp teeth, carry some pretty cool weapons, and have 2 gigantic beasts as pets.",/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2012,Allen-Uncle-Mont-Williams,9," Kevin Durand Steals The Show....
","When I first started to watch this film, I was worried that the villains in this story were not going to work. Like in ""Independence Day"" or the animated ""Titan A.E."" The villains had no substance in those films at all. The way the bad guys were introduced made me believe that they were going to be just a bunch of mindless creatures that want to kill everything and everyone in their path.",/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2011,TourettesPersonal,4," Caruso The Generic
","Let's try to go back to 2008. We got ""Eagle Eye"", It's a mixture of various sci-fi flicks. Now we have ""I Am Number Four"". Yeah it's based on a book, but everything you see is familiar. I just noticed most of Caruso's sci-fi movies have clichéd ideas. Is it the writer's fault? Some of the dialog is also generic. The special effects looks so homemade(look at the lasers). The actors have murmur problem. ""I Am Number Four"" is underrated in a bad way.",/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2011,cudaseeker-1,7," I echo the sentiment of many
","Watched the movie ""I am number four"" tonight. The first 40 minutes it felt like I was watching a re-hashed ""Twilight"" movie rather than a sci-fi/horror pic. But then it got good. It was well worth the watch if you can make it through that first half of beaten to death formula high school angst movies that Twilight has seemed to spawn. You can bet that there will be sequels too, but they may be straight to video. The first half of the movie I give it 1 star, but it was the fault of the story, not the acting. The second half, I give it 8 stars. The acting was good, there were very nice special effects and some pretty cool alien bad guys in the style of ""Pinhead.""",/review/rw6508084/?ref_=tt_urv
