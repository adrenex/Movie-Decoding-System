26 August 2019,toncincin,7," Delightful Fluff
","I found this show a few weeks ago. I've now watched all three seasons. It's a delightful escape - not reality. Everything in life does MOT revolve around sex. BUT that being said - it's pure escapism ... just don't believe it's true life. Kind of like a Hallmark movie - don't believe it. I watched it for enjoyment, friendship, and entertainment. Will watch season 4 when it comes out!",/review/rw5516634/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2018,mizzybie,4," Unrealistically lucky
","Choose an episode, any episode. Let me tell you how it goes.
3 girls start of confident, ""bold"", cocky. Something happens to each of them. The confidence is shaken. Woe is me. One will yell at/cry on/ completely disrespect their boss. One will make a tech mistake of some kind. One will make a relationship error. They talk about it together- except it's never a discussion, it's a monologue where each one is self obsessing and generally ignoring the others' problems. Then they work through the episode feeling bad, having no confidence, wanting to quit and all of a sudden... it all works out perfectly!!! ",/review/rw5516634/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2021,saradoree,4," Potential wasted, again
","I don't want to ruin pleasure of watching an average background show to anyone who agreed to Netflix late years sub-standard, but this show is too unreal to be true and the potential got wasted straight in the beginning.
First, I'm sure there's more to a young female journalist than being constantly angry and giving their boss the attitude before an adequate performance.
Second, one of the topics was apparently feminism, yet the actresses were chosen according to every teenage series standards saying young women are just fine out there wearing their lashes and mini skirts, with almost no emphasis on their character whatsoever and making them say whatever they want with no consequences at all.
Third, why not to show off some harder and more complex stories they could be working on? I think we are way beyond the tutorials on how to apply the lipstick in 2021. Again, I missed the feminism part in their work completely.
I'm a young woman in her early 30s and yet find it very hard to relate to these characters slash career women. It's an amazing opportunity worth exploring much more beyond the surface. Sex and the city may seem easy to copy, but you shouldn't miss the complexity of how to make a show work.
Once I'm up for background fillers, I will probably get back to it.",/review/rw5516634/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2021,leila_sami,5," Only OK
","It's fine but, like someone else said, everything just works out for them in the most unlikely, far-fetched ways. They get jobs that they're wildly under-qualified for by just being themselves. They sleep with whoever they want to (including very senior management) with zero consequences. A woman who has never had an orgasm miraculously has one by doing nothing really except sleeping with a new guy for the first time (because we all know that happens on the regular).
Sadly I think that this reinforces what we were all told when we were kids: that we are special snowflakes and we just need to be ourselves. The reality is that the corporate world is cut-throat, we did graduate into the worst job market in modern times (as one of the characters points out in a rare glimpse of realism) and there are hundreds of applicants for every job; so you won't get that amazing job you want by doing a crafty mood board and showing that your parents think you're special: you need to be hard-working, (over) qualified and stand out from the crowd. If you sleep with the boss, people will find out and belittle your achievements (especially as a woman). And if you get anything stuck in your nether-regions, go to a frickin doctor and don't ask your friend to take it out in a closet at work that anyone can walk into.
As long as you take this with a very large pinch of salt and realise that it is ALL fiction and enjoy it for what it is, it's fine really, if nothing overly interesting or groundbreaking.",/review/rw5516634/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2020,lilac-31582,3," Mehh.... was good, not anymore...
","Could be better. Looking at their ""age,"" they would never be this far up the totem pole with their careers. Its a very millenial show meaning that they say whetever comes across their mind regardless of the supposed outcomes should be but never are and if they meet resistance they complain of how unfair it is and everything should change. They show didn't seem too liberal to start with but as the seasons have passed, everything makes a hard left; opinions are now being guilted into being politically correct so you have to change your opinion or you're a *gasp* Republican or against the majority. Jane literally can't use the word ""woke"" now b/c her half-black counterpart said no. Kat, as social media director at a whopping age of early-20-something tried to stick it to the man (ie the president of the board of directors for the magazine). Honey, please, if you were this direct as an adolescent women trying to show everyone they're wrong and you're right, you'd be fired in a jiffy. I feel like it depicts women as these highly emotional, fly off the handle creatures. Trying to make everything ""right"" as they all do, really just looks like you tattle-tale. As a another reviewer said, women literally burned their bras and stood up for equality, and these girls/writers forgot to put their big girl panties on and play hard-ball. As I wrote that, they literally made me think of my 2 toddlers... ""Mommy! He threw my toy! Mommy, she hit me."" Then again, these main characters are millenials so what else could I expect from those toddlers.",/review/rw5516634/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2021,slaurentlarochec,7," Disappointed. Season 4 ruined it!
",Got into it as from the very first episode. The characters professionalism in their job was kind of inspiring. The show was interesting and pretty captivating. But season 4 went down to be cheesy. It's still worth watching up to season 3.,/review/rw5516634/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2021,kelihari,3," Preachy and Basic
","'preachy' but also 'basic' are two words I never thought could be used to describe the same product. Yet somehow The Bold Type manages to horribly be both! Three basic chicks live it up and prefer not be called out for their actions, yet also go around preaching at everyone else about others actions. It was honestly so hard to decide which character to dislike most in this series. And I can say this because I am a millennial chick of 27 years old who works at a magazine. I am precisely who this series is aimed at, and I can say I've never felt so put off by a New Adult series.",/review/rw5516634/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2018,HallowedEve,1," Who paid for those positive reviews?
","The only reason I can think of for those ridiculous glowing reviews is someone promised them something good, because this show is atrocious! I guess they were aiming for Sex In The City for young millennials, but this doesn't even raise to the level of that garbage show. There is nothing feminist about three gorgeous and perfect young woman who want to succeed in fashion, that is just playing into a stereotype that we only care about fashion and looks. And where is the challenge? They have a caring, nurturing boss (which rarely exists in real life) and they easily succeed with few obstacles in life- everyone is cheering these pretty girls on. Stupid, vapid and shallow. Skip it.",/review/rw5516634/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2021,biba_yu,5," Pretty looking, fluffy fairytale for girls
","This show has nice aesthetics, pretty people, glamour, expensive, shiny stuff all around, rich expensive look of everyone and everything. How can you not look at it? It has also some naive, fairytale settings, dream jobs for 20 something girls, beautiful apartments in NY, luxurious clothes, dream boss who is such goody-two-shoes it's totally impossible, girlfriends forever and ever, super busy very young women who work long hours yet always look incredibly polished, with perfect styling, make up and hair... It's nice to look at and get lost in it like in most fairytales, but that's not life.",/review/rw5516634/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2020,barrflye,3," Season 4 - boldly going off a cliff
","Utterly disappointed in the 2nd half of season 4. Particularly with the Sutton/Richard story line. The writers missed a real opportunity to explore a twenty something person in a committed marriage, which is not represented at all on the show. It would have been nice to see that dynamic represented and fully explored, but instead they almost instantly pulled the plug. I think fans of the show would have really enjoyed seeing Sutton and Richard juggle career, their new marriage and starting a family. The ups and downs, the compromises, the missteps, and the funny new parent moments. Instead we get a spiraling self destructive Sutton story line in which she sleeps with her HS boyfriend less than a week after Richard walks out. Sorry, very little to root for this season, and during a global pandemic, I really hoped for something / someone to root for.",/review/rw5516634/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2021,fuleruth,2," Just not realistic
","The friendship, events, setting, scenarios etc just don't flow naturally. The I can't breath without my friends theme is not natural. It was an easy watch but just too unreal.",/review/rw5516634/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2018,stefaniejuana,1," Sucks
","The main characters are all about being these super feminist, mid-twenty women who call them selfes milennials in literally every second sentence. I, as a woman in her mid-twentys as well, never called myself a millennial nor do I consider myself one, also I don't know anyone who ever would. 
Literally every problem they have is something picked out of the headlines of the last couple of years. For example when they protest against the Instagram policy that doesn't allow female nipples to be shown on pictutes. It's an important conversation we need to have. But instead of resisting and actually taking a stand against that policy the only thing that is shown in the show is a bunch of male nipples and a picture of a nude statue. No female nippels were shown in any of those episode! But plenty of male nipples.
This showed me more than anything else that this show is only trying to discuss certain topics to make it appealing to a certain demographic but does nothing to really take a stand against common policys.",/review/rw5516634/?ref_=tt_urv

12 April 2019,foghorn_clj,4," Vapid self-indulgent nonsense
","It's like they combined the world of BuzzFeed, Twitter and Instagram with a group of young, entitled self-involved women and turned it into a cheap knock off of Sex and the City. It'd fall just above the Kardashians on a scale of quality tv viewing (but only just).",/review/rw5516634/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2017,mhroth-03528,10," a sweet, funny, progressive show!
","i think there's no reason for this show to have a 5.9. it's funny, clever, dramatic, and exciting, all while being about feminism- particularly inter sectional feminism-at a magazine called ""scarlet"". its unique even when it plays into tropes. the main trio are likable, interesting characters that we can root for.

","Starting out, I wasn't overly impressed as there were many storylines that seemed too similar to those from Sex and the City. But as I progressed into season 2, the girls grew on me. Strong characters and laugh out loud lines especially from ""Sutton"". Really enjoying the show and hope it gets renewed.",/review/rw5516634/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2019,wynnsv,6," The show is good only because of Sutton!
","So I usually don't write reviews but I felt compelled to do so, bc I honestly don't understand why I watch this show but I can't help myself. I realized the most redeeming quality of the main 3 characters is Sutton. She is such a great character and fun to watch. Very much reminds me of a person who could be on Younger. But as for the other two Jane is tolerable, but Kat is the most intolerable character on the show! I say if you like Younger get give it a shot, but you will find that Sutton gives you that appreciation",/review/rw5516634/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2017,Orson47,2," Seriously, who really lives and talks this way?
","This show desperately attempts to cover ALL of the bases at once. We have these twenty-something BFF's who all work for the same magazine in one capacity or another and are constantly under the gun from their know it all boss, who despite her gruff exterior is really just a sweetheart. She has the maternal instincts of someone who did a bad job as a mother for her own kids and now can take these three, mostly Jane, though, under her wing and mold them into fine young women who care about everything important all the time. Of course, they care about everything important except when it means that it will in some small way prevent them from getting ahead, getting laid or most of all landing that special someone...their soul mate! The best scenes are in the fashion closet where they can be their shallow selves and offer advice to each other or get it from the mother superior. The dialogue was written by someone who wishes everyone actually talks the way the script is written and acting is just not that good. All of them are attractive physically, but they have the depth of a kiddie pool. There are, of course, attempts at diversity both racially and sexually, but the actors are so very stereotypical that they lack any credibility. What is more interesting is how these young women afford the digs that they live in on their small salaries in a city we are led to believe is New York but is really Montreal. Rents are high there, too! I guess if you want a dose of unreality, then this fluff is perfect for you. I am sure in the end, each one of these women will achieve what they have set out to do: have an orgasm, land that job in high fashion, and figure out if being gay is really a bad thing when you know you can never tell your parents. These people need to have real problems like clogged sinks or head colds and then it might begin to resemble real life.",/review/rw5516634/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2021,mikeratnam,6," Okayish to binge but very far from reality
",Somehow the makers of this show portrayed the vulnerabilities of woman especially Jane all-over and Sutton in Season 4. Skipped Most of Kat and Adena episodes coz it's very irritating how Kat changes her love interests from time to time. May be as a guy I feel the observing angle rather than personal angle but whatever happened to Richard was not good and not well written in my opinion. Theme was great also Jacqueline was pretty amazing. Good for binging but gets more unnecessarily dramatic as it goes.,/review/rw5516634/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2020,chrissm38,8," Girliest Dreams Come True
","This show satisfies my most feminine fantasies of that glamorous job, office romance, and a sisterly bond of best friends. I also absolutely appreciate that the female boss character isn't a b*tch and actually supports her employees in a strong motherly way.
All in all, the show is very entertaining and I'm continuing to binge away!",/review/rw5516634/?ref_=tt_urv
