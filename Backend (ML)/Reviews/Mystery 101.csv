","Great story, not too funny that it will lose its meaning and not much dramatic it will makes you hold your laughs. Its a mix of both.",/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv

Wolf Like Me 2022 Stan
My Rating 9/10",/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,TxMike,," Very engaging but ends where it starts to get really interesting.
","This six-episode series was shot within a short time in the middle of 2021 in Australia. Interestingly Australian actress Isla Fisher plays an American living in Australia. She has a big secret, she must isolate herself one night each month during full moon.",/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,gallagherkellie,8," I wasn't sure what to expect
",But honestly wow!! It's a dark comedy and I really did giggle a lot. I also had tears in my eyes/almost cried more than once. I even felt scared at one stage. It has it all. I loved the characters and really felt for them and believed in their chemistry. I'm so sick of people saying that because he's overweight he would never get a girl like her...I found his character so cute and appealing. The acting was great and I wish there was more!! Although I'm so glad they kept it short and sweet and didn't overdo anything.,/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2022,skpn123,9," What an engaging surprise
","I have to say upfront this is not at all my move genre - in fact, a totally unique offering nothing like anything I have seen and holding nothing that I would generally like. Yet I was totally captivated and binge watched all 6 episodes hoping another season comes soon.",/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,jhuebel,9," Really Got Caught Up In The Characters
","I really enjoyed this. I took a star off because it was a little slow in a couple of places. And they liked to use ""knowing glances"" in a few spots. But other than that, this was really well done.",/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,donmccandless-86320,8," A fresh take on 'moon-crossed' lovers
","I became engaged at the get-go, and the story, the characters, picked up speed as the story raced along. The 'moon-crossed' lovers were evenly matched by the young actress that played the traumatized daughter.",/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,stevebondi,7," Good emotional performances amidst an interesting fantasy scenario :-)
","Sure the limited effects were a bit cheesy and it should have been a 2-hour movie instead of a 3-hour miniseries, but nevertheless it was enjoyable overall :-) All three main characters including the young girl gave convincing performances.",/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,heykateforever,9," Great story, good cast ensemble, love the Australian setting - NEEDS A SEASON 2!
","I cannot believe the downrates here! To be honest, I wasn't sure myself I wanted to continue after Episode 1. But I have learned NOT to base a show's worth on one episode. My husband and I got hooked by Episode 4 when the story began to heat up and the cast was more familiar and everything was falling into place. I loved the casting of Isla Fisher as the werewolf/love interest for Josh Gad's character. She is always amazing, and shines brightly in this gem of a series. Gad also is very good and the girl who plays his daughter does so with just the right attitude of a budding teenager. But it was Episode 6, the final episode, when I knew this was another great show as things come to a head and secrets are no longer possible. Then, it ended abruptly at a pivotal moment with nothing resolved which blew my mind and my husband's! So, a continuation is necessary!! We must know how this ""pack"" turns out!",/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv

",Wolf Like Me is an engaging series with likable characters and an incredibly interesting premise.,/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2022,anilakygt,10," Unexpected Pleasure
","I got into this show today not knowing anything about the plot and have not watched trailers or anything. I thought it was going to be a drama
Show about two people grieving and moving on based on the first episode but I was very wrong. It is so much more and very fun! This will probably get hate reviews so i am rating it 10! But it truly does deserve a 10. I wish there were more episodes. Great job!",/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2022,jeffmvines,7," There's something about Mary...
","This is different kind of love story from Down Under. I'm not sure why they cast Josh Gad in the lead role as Gary, a single father suffering from a literal case of puppy love. Maybe it was to attract the American market? Whatever the reason may be, he did a good job and the onscreen chemistry between Gad and Fisher was surprisingly believable. Isla Fisher as Mary, was adorable as usual. If you're expecting Olaf or the typical Gad humour you may be disappointed. This series is a drama not a comedy or horror.",/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2022,Archangel326,9," Suprise!! Great Show
","I really enjoyed this show that I had never heard about just thought I would check it out. What a surprise it is really well done, great writing and acting. With all the shows now called things like, My Neighbor the murder, Story of a serial killer and My spouse my executioner, this was a refreshing work of fiction. For me it is so much better than reliving the lives of real life monsters. This is entertaining, they don't even beat you over the head with diversity, which for me is a much needed break. Don't get me wrong diversity is good, just not in every other program that isn't about murdering someone. Its a Drama, Love story with a little twist of Wxxxxxxxxx in London vibe but in Australia.",/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv

",My mum and I saw the commercials for this show and thought we'd watch the first episode just to check it out and omg we binged the whole season haha It's such an odd show but is so good! Already keen for Season 2. Great acting aswell. Highly recommend!,/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,christinecandow,10," Creative twist on romantic dramedy
","I watched the series last night and woke up still thinking about it. Lots of interesting risks taken here creatively. Long camera takes like the run through town and an entire song sitting in the car. Just beautiful. Who does that? Every human ever riding in car, but in a short tv series? No way. Will that appeal to horror fans looking for a thrill? No, but I was pretty petrified during a few moments. Not because I'm afraid of werewolves, but because I was emotionally invested in the characters which isn't easy to do with such a goofy premise. It takes excellent acting (well Olaf could use a few retakes) and a script that deeply understands human connections. But why was there a viewing bar in the door? Was it her hope bar?",/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,anthonyaubin,10," Amazing!
","My wife and I both came across the trailer for this show on YouTube and we decided to give it a shot, and we do not regret it! The cast was phenomenal, and the humor was right on the money! I hope this series continues! Beside Mary's werewolf form looking kinda ""budgeted"" I'm giving it a 10/10! Great show and highly recommend!",/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv

",That was really good. The acting was good. The characters believable.,/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,hasaandussoye,8," Great Show
",This is a show that reminds me of Santa Clarita Diet but with a smarter script and more emotional undertones behind the comedy. I hope it gets renewed cuz i loved every bit of it and bingewatched it in a night.,/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,kerwinjrmail,10," So good!
","I really enjoyed the whole season. Binged watched this show and I wish I could have more to watch. It has a little of everything in it, a bit hallmark and a bit sci-fi. The characters a very likeable and I found myself really connect with the dad played by Josh Gad. Highly recommended for viewers who enjoy a little sappy romance with their fantasy.",/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,matlock-74399,9," Remember Santa Clarita Diet? Well here's something similar
","It's all in the title of my review- this show has lots of heart, lots of bite. It's just such a light hearted show. My only wish is that the episodes were a bit longer! Check this out, you probably won't regret it! 8/10.",/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,johnwwwatson,10," OMG - More Please!
",Just 1 episode down and wow!,/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,chrisvdg,9," Whole is more than sum of its parts
","This is a series begged to be watched in one sitting. Feature length would have worked better. Unlike comparisons to Santa Clarita Diet, the 'supernatural' is metaphoric of grief, mental illness and love. Viewed through this prism, it is a beautiful tale. Yes, many small tweaks could be made but, arguably, it's those imperfections which add to the power of the argument. Make it through the first 3 episodes and you will be reimbursed with its finale.",/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,Wenchpie,10," A wild ride
","Don't listen to the reviews that slated this show. Loved this. So much fun to watch! The acting was spot on and I found myself rooting for the 3 main characters. Here's wishing for a season 2, this story needs to continue. 10/10.",/review/rw7755404/?ref_=tt_urv
