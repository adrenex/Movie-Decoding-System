",The doctor is usually right on; even if the cause of death is obvious. He explains the circumstances and fills in the small details that one would want to know. The photos of the actual reports are interesting to look at when pausing the show. I find the insights to a person's last days/minutes very interesting.,/review/rw6827106/?ref_=tt_urv

",Pure sensationalism television. Do not waste your time watching this. This series do not even try to be educational or to explain illnesses at all. The dramatizations are badly done and lack of minimal interest or veracity. In the Andy Gibb episode the photo of him with kari michelsen is a fake photo cut and pasted from the real one of him with victoria principal... that only can provide an idea of the authenticity level of this series. A demonstration of how low a television show can get to obtain audience at any price. Unbearable to watch. Better read a good book instead. Panem et circenses.,/review/rw6827106/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was laughing throughout the whole thing! The man was 82 years old!!! Where is the mystery? This is not forensics....this is desperation digging for a show. He lived hard...smoked,drank,etc. And lived to the age of 82. Bravo for him! There is no mystery how he died. The mystery is how he lived that long.",/review/rw6827106/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2020,eeyorespillow,1," Don't bother! No science...pure trash tv!
","I watched this hoping to find something that would make me fall asleep, instead I was super annoyed with the nonsense. This so called 'expert' doctor who seems to act as if he knows everything must be working for tmz or enquirer or some tabloid! The junk he cites is complete BS and if I were any of the family members of the people he is speaking about- I'd sue him for slander. For example- he goes off on several medications-keflex (antibiotic) as a 'SUPER STRONG DRUG' (it is a really good bacterial antibiotic); hydrocodone (opiate) a 'SUPER STRONG HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!' Goes on to compare to medical heroine- that is reaching A LOT! (Never shows the prescription or what amount is in the person's system. In one case, he cites all these meds-and states klonopin was in her system- 'this is an epileptic drug and she didn't have this!' Yea- never says also used for anxiety or sleep. He just goes on and on in hype and BS. It is much easier than most would think to get a copy of an autopsy report- so the fact that this doc happens to have the so called report doesn't mean anything. He goes on an on citing his opinions that they all took all these drugs and why they died- his opinion- which he is entitled to but to spout off the way he does- rhetoric. Never once does he say any of these meds could have caused an anaphylaxis reaction in these people and that could be why they died. üëéüèºüëéüèº",/review/rw6827106/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2020,lizamarie-veiga,6," I could be on this show
",I've always had an interest in autopsies and knowing what was the ultimate causes of death so naturally I was interested in this show. And although the narrator does a great job and the re-enactment actor is are decent the alleged doctor is horrible. He literally states the obvious and tells us exactly what we already know. No new information or insight into these cases. I would have rated this higher if he wasn't on the show.,/review/rw6827106/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2021,tuckerfurguy,5," More Speculation Than Verified Truth
","Seems like a lot of speculation, rather than verified medical findings specific to the celebrity's cause of death. While there are verified medical facts given in relation to each celebrity's autopsy, there is more speculation, guessing, and indirect information thrown around which is not necessarily relative to that person's death, at all. If I was a family member of the celebrity featured in the show, I'd be appalled. Then there is the embarrassing fact that Dr. Michael Hunter repeatedly mispronounced the words metastatic and metastasis. He is supposed to be an expert with a long line of cases he has worked. Why did no one correct him? How did he not know the correct terms and how to say them?",/review/rw6827106/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2020,janiewelsh,5," Interesting, but the doctor is whacko
","This program is interesting, but you can't believe most of what this ""doctor"" says. He does get A LOT of medications wrong. For instance, he states that Brittany Murphy was on topiramate, which is a strong medication for someone with seizures, but she's not epileptic!!! Yeah, but it is also used to treat migraine headaches. And is that man said that a benzo is used to treat depression one more time, I'm going to hunt him down. The funniest though is when they are giving someone rescue breathes using a bag and have the mask on them upside down. So, it's decent entertainment, but I can't believe this guy is a real doctor (he is, I looked it up). Guess it's a good thing he only works on dead people.",/review/rw6827106/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2015,infothewrite,10," Please be careful
","Dear Dr. Richard Shepherd, I am troubled that you called the final throat slicing in the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson, a 'Coup De Grace'. A 'Coupe de Grace' is a mercy death blow to end suffering. This psychotic killer had no intention of ending any suffering; it was a either a crime of passion (love or hate) killing that wanted her eradicated, and/or they only wanted to assure her death beyond any and all means. This is far, far from a 'coup de grace.' Wrongfully using this phrase in your 'Nicole Brown Simpson/ Ron Goldman's' final hours' has also elevated O.J. Simpson to a new high or low, which ever side you are on. Although I was taken back by this last final act of slicing or sawing her throat on your show (even 20 years later), you were still very wrong and very incorrect for phrasing it as a 'Coup De Grace.'
