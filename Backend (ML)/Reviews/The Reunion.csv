19 July 2022,owenpont-70803,9," Well done film.............
","This film was not on my radar at all. But I watched it. And loved it. I thought the acting was on point. The directing was beautifully done, the movie reminded me of a film from the 50s or 60s. The writing was well done and pretty much perfect. The film had a nice feel to it making it easily rewatchable. Overall its definitely a under the radar film, but it should be watched. Its highly enjoyable for the whole family and is a very sweet film.",/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2022,chong_an,8," Nice charming film about a working-class hero
","This is a well-directed and well-acted film about an English charwoman who becomes besotted with a Dior dress, and eventually manages to cobble up the funds to go to the House of Dior in Paris to buy one. But a Dior dress is not something she can buy off-the-rack, and so Mrs Harris has time for side adventures. The film is well-directed and well-acted, and allegedly the re-creations of Dior are authentic.",/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2022,ferguson-6,7," it's nice to see nice
","Greetings again from the darkness. Leslie Manville is one of those actors we take for granted. She's so talented and versatile and typically ""perfect"" in the supporting roles she embodies. For us followers of British filmmaker Mike Leigh, we've been treated to numerous Manville performances over the years, but it's likely she's most widely recognized for her Oscar nominated performance in Paul Thomas Anderson's PHANTOM THREAD (2017), where she played Daniel Day-Lewis' sister and business partner with an icy efficiency that added heft to a terrific film. This time, Ms. Manville embraces the lead and delivers a turn as a Mrs. Harris that we would all welcome into our lives.",/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2022,jisforjoe,7," A Harmless Treat
","If you come in expecting to be told a fairytale, you will not be disappointed. It is a well-executed fairytale meant to teach morals as opposed to be realistic. It's 'Cinderella' meets 'The Devil Wears Prada' meets 'Pretty Woman' with a dash of 'The Phantom of the Open'.",/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv

","In 1950s London, a widowed cleaning lady falls madly in love with a Dior dress, deciding she must have one of her own.",/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2022,bostonct,10," A most charming movie....
","This is one of the most charming movies I've ever seen. Lesley Manville's execution of her role of someone that is optimistic, attentive, considerate, and hopeful, suffers a few setbacks, yet still have the strength to carry on and stand up when it matters the most is Oscar worthy. A lot of substance with this actor. She is also surrounded by a supporting cast with is rich in talent, experience and timing. OK, it has Hollywood ending written all over the place but it is such a fun movie. And this is coming from someone that favors insane fantasies, comedies galore, sci-fi and everything else not of this world.",/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2022,rannynm,10," I love everything about how this film looks from the scenery, to the actors, the music, the script -- everything fits the storyline so perfectly.
",I enjoyed Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris and so will people who stand up for what they believe. Ada Harris is an admirable character that serves as a positive role model.,/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2022,Anurag-Shetty,9," An eye-catching & feel-good movie.
",Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris is based on the novel of the same name by Paul Gallico. It tells the story of Ada Harris(Lesley Manville). Ada Harris is a house help who is a widow. Mrs. Harris is mesmerized by a haute couture Christian Dior dress & decides that she must buy one & travels to Paris.,/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2022,chris_rowe-881-168820,10," Wholesome and beautiful.
","I don't understand the negative reviews, it's completely obvious the plot and style of this film are going to be a certain way, it'll flow, maybe a few twists but I genuinely am astounded what some people were expecting of a film that delivers exactly what it said it was.",/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2022,MysteryInc_69,8," Have you ever been smothered by charm and authenticity?
","Mrs. Harris is maybe not the hero we deserve, but the one we need. Everywhere she goes, her kindness spreads like an infectious disease; I'm pretty sure a bit spilled out of the screen and got some of us in the audience. She handles life with such an authenticity, It's marvelous, refreshing.",/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2022,jasogle,7," Pleasant Afternoon out of the Heat
","A fun and refreshing afternoon at the movies. Very little drama, some fun lines and totally predictable story. So what? That's what fun movies are for.",/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2022,evanston_dad,5," So Bland and Neutered
",A film that's so determined to be unoffensive that it ends up being hopelessly bland and neutered even for the kind of movie it is.,/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,karinahatem,4," Very disappointing
","If this was supposed to be a remake of the original movie, then they did a bad job. Besides all the changes they made in the movie, the whole essence of the movie was gone, how Mrs. Harris struggles to save every penny, travels to Paris, and gets kicked out of the Dior store, and fights her way back in, in the process she amends several broker relationships. While this one, Mrs. Harris, just walks in and gets the dress, even the ending was bad.",/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2022,masonsaul,8," Great heartwarming fun
",Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris frustratingly ends rather abruptly but that doesn't stop it from being a great movie that's endlessly heartwarming and joy to watch whilst celebrating the regular people whose necessary contributions often go overlooked.,/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2022,pbstarman,10," PURE MAGIC

23 July 2022,jacksonmeddows,7," Feel good movie
","It fills the role of a nice, funny, feel good movie. Made me smile, and my grandma even more. The acting was on point and the dresses were fabulous, of course.",/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,Birminghamukengland,10," Masterclass in acting from Lesley as always.
","I've always sought out films with Lesley in, as she is such a fine actor. I loved her playing very dramatic parts in Mike Leigh's films and of course the brilliant Mum.",/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2022,silvermistvio,5," Lacks built-in subtitle like the other partially non-English spoken films.
","Initially, I was going to give 7 stars but my final rating landed on 5 stars because there was no built-in subtitle for French parts. Not all people understand French language, you know. If you want to do other languages rather than English, at least you should have built-in subtitle in the film. Without it, the audience will get lost in some parts even if most of the film is English.",/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv

5 October 2022,wheatley-20230,7," Offers many pleasures
","This is an entertaining film, offering many pleasures. The book by Paul Gallico is itself charming and the film successfully retains that quality, most obviously because Leslie Manville inhabits her character with sincerity. Before you know it you have forgiven even the most unlikely plot contrivances and been willingly carried along for the ride.",/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2022,MrDeWinters,1," embarrassing
","It looks fake, artificial and staged. No sense of reality, cartoonish. Bright colours and glossy depiction of poverty. Historically inaccurate. Soulless. Turned it off after the scene at the couture show. Not only the models of that era did not behave like this nor were they non-white, not in Haute Couture houses of 1957!",/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2022,MrsOscar,5," Sweet but...
","To begin, it's beautifully filmed with lovely locations, fabulous costumes and feels authentic..except the characters. It'd be impossible to meet this many helpful, charming, accommodating French people in one year, never mind a single week. From offers of accommodation, escort, lift, to entry into the atelier, it's literally unbelievable! So suspend your belief system and enjoy the lovely clothes and the possibility that it dreams do come true and pass almost two hours of gentle entertainment. Or wait for it to be on Netflix and you can fast forward the filler bits.",/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2022,justintannerpw1,6," Soundtrack from Hell
","Another example of a perfectly lovely movie that is utterly destroyed by the non stop chattering of its busy, busy musical soundtrack. There are about five minutes of film where the chugging, scampering and whining music stops and the relief is overwhelming. Otherwise not a moment goes by where we aren't being told exactly how to feel from second to second. Loudly. I wanted to pull my ears off my head.",/review/rw8336687/?ref_=tt_urv
