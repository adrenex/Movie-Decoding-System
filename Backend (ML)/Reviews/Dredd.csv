24 June 2022,JayDeeezy,6," Fails to Justify Its Existence
",Lucasfilm needs to let the past go. This and Boba Fett were so mediocre. It should be a telling sign that the only show with new characters and stories (Mando) is the only one that's succeeding to capture our hearts.,/review/rw8271370/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,8," I liked it!
","Obi-Wan Kenobi may not the best thing from Star Wars that I've seen but it's still worth watching. Ewan McGregor is a great actor and one of the best parts of the prequel trilogy. I was really looking forward to this when I first read about it and the even more so after I saw the trailers. It did not disappoint! I don't consider myself a huge Star Wars fan but I normal fan who does enjoy most of them. I really liked The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett was worth watching. I don't understand most of these negative reviews, it's like most of the people writing them didn't want to enjoy them. If you saw him in the prequels and saw the trailers what were you expecting that you didn't get? Anyway, if you're a fan of Star Wars I definitely recommend you give this a try.",/review/rw8271370/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,8," Thought it was pretty entertaining!
","I actually enjoyed Obi-Wan Kenobi a lot more than I expected to. After reading all the mixed reviews I was expecting a slow moving, boring show but this was anything but. I was very entertained from the very first episode to the last. I was actually wanting more episodes when it was over. I'm glad that it's already been renewed for another season. Some of these negative reviews are just ridiculous, people are hating for the sake of hating. As most here have already pointed out, Ewan McGregor is the best part of this series. He's great as Obi-Wan. You can tell they put a lot of love into this because the attention to detail is very obvious. While it's not as good as the Mandalorian it's still a good show in its own right and definitely worth the time of watching it.",/review/rw8271370/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2022,lovefalloutkindagamer,6," Hold On - I Watched All 6 Episodes
","I waited until all of the episodes were released before passing a final judgement on this. I can say I'm glad I did, as the first couple episodes were 3/10 stars for a tv show with the latter being more toward a 7/10.",/review/rw8271370/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2022,hoernkeem,," Obi-Wan Kenobi (2022, Disney+) Great seeing McGregor back but weak plot and villain makes all problematic
","'Obi-Wan Kenobi' is a six episode limited series set in the Star Wars universe 10 years after the events of the 'Star Wars: Episode III' film. It follows the titular Ben Kenobi as he has secrets himself on Tatooine to monitor the raising of young Luke Skywalker in an attempt to ensure the child stays off the Empire's radar. Ewan McGregor who is Kenobi in the prequel trilogy reprises his role in this series. Other returning cast members include Jimmy Smits as Bail Organa and Hayden Christensen as Darth Vader. Deborah Chow, who directed 2 episodes of the first season of 'The Mandalorian', directs the entire season of 'Obi-Wan Kenobi'.",/review/rw8271370/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,donutpizza,8," The Last Jedi with lightsabers that don't work
","This is much like The Last Jedi in its plot, grumpy Obi-Wan instead of grumpy Luke, which fits. I really like the inquisitors, and the little girl is perfectly adorable. I don't mind the Reva character, though maybe acted a little American like and less a fantasy character. The acting is good on the whole, the story is engaging, and the music is well done.",/review/rw8271370/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2022,drpainters,7," Decent enough
","It was decent enough. Lot of plot threads I didn't care for. The leia actress was terrible and editing to make her outrun people was laughable. Would eliminate that character completely and have just focused on Vader tracking obiwan , the student turned villain, and should of had some of the emporer in there as well. Had some decent fight scenes and cameos but a bunch of it felt like it dragged and cameos were just very forced. Effects overall impressive for the series and I would say I'd watch it again when watching the movies, am moving onto andor next, ratings are higher for it overall so see how that is. I was more interested in obi wan, though there are 0 stakes as you know him, Luke & parents, Leia will all be fine. Wouldn't really recommend to any other than big star wars fans.",/review/rw8271370/?ref_=tt_urv

28 June 2022,owen-watts,6," I hate sand.
","Feels like it's been re-written a dozen different times by a dozen different dispassionate writers who are painfully trying to squeeze creative blood from an algorithmic marketing decision. Makes the rookie prequel mistake of heaping acres of tension onto the unchangeable fates of established characters rather than giving us new characters to care about. Some nice effects work and young Leia is gloriously cast, but the action is shoddily constructed, it treads oceans of water and it is likely the weakest and ropiest bit of live action Wars TV yet made. Severely hope we don't get more.",/review/rw8271370/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2022,ercfunk-445-950046,3," Acting can't save bad writing
","New Star Wars with Disney seems to have the same problem, again and again: bad writing. With the exception of Jon and Dave's work, new Star Wars is getting worse with their writing. It doesn't matter how well the actors do their roles when they're poorly written, there's no saving it. Either get a team that knows how to write or just stop.",/review/rw8271370/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2022,johnkampouropoulos,8," Very good spin-off
","I was amazed when I first saw the advertising: there would be an Obi Wan Kenobi mini series. For me, McGregor (one of the best actors in his age) is Obi Wan in his youth, after being portrayed by sir Alec Guiness in the original trilogy. In addition, the promise to see Hayden Christensen reprising the role of Darth Vader, had made me more happy and anticipating, as I had admired his being the character of Anakin/Vader since his first appearance on ""Star Wars: Attack of the Clones"" prequel film. I was also pleasantly surprised by the role of Tala, portrayed by the talented Indra Varma, which I had come to respect since her ""Rome"" series days.",/review/rw8271370/?ref_=tt_urv

5 June 2022,jojunno,," AWFUL Train Wreck
","After multiple episodes it's safe to say this series is an absolute train wreck. I couldn't imagine worse writing if it was intentional. How do you screw up Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader and princess Leia this badly? And yes, the new characterr Reva is atrocious. Has all the depth of a mud puddle. No sane person would praise this trash. There has to be an agenda at play if anybody is saying anything positive about this High School level production.",/review/rw8271370/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2022,simsbros-89231,8," A flawed, but ultimately riveting character study.
","You'll have a lot of folks tell you this show is terrible or has no redeeming qualities. Most of them aren't to be taken seriously. This is a character study that squeezes itself imperfectly in between the Prequel trilogy and the Original trilogy that details a sort of side quest Obi Wan goes on that introduces him to an important ally and pits him once more against his old friend Anakin Skywalker, now the ruthless Darth Vader.",/review/rw8271370/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,teodor_coman,6," Big disappointment
","I expected much more and eagerly waited for this series. It totally disappointed me. The directing is faulty and the actors are not permitted to exploit their talent. Besides the plot twist involving Vader and Reva, there is nothing interesting about the show.",/review/rw8271370/?ref_=tt_urv

27 May 2022,finn9849,9," Plenty to enjoy, but I see the flaws.
","First off, without spoiling, I appreciate Ewan McGregor's performance and the dynamic between him and a special character I shall not name. It really fills a lot of gaps within Star Wars lore that's been left out to interpretation. My main complaints are mostly nitpicks other viewes are willing to forgive, and I often get a general feeling on why I miss Star Wars movies. And that's the quality in the sets. So far in Obi-Wan, there's more than a few times I'm reminded of watching a TV show. I don't feel that immersion. The biggest flaw as well is that there's too many humans in the background, and not enough aliens. The floors often look too flat, and there isn't enough to express the crowded nature of towns, streets, etc. Plus there is a forest scene that feels too much like our Earth's forest, and not a Star Wars flavored forest. It's the same sorts of issues I've had with The Mandalorian and Boba Fett. But hey, that's just me. Obi-Wan is my favorite Star Wars character, and I'm still locked in to see how the story unfolds.",/review/rw8271370/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2022,santimoya,6," Sad but true ...DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE
