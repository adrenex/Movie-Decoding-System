8 January 2019,Ed-Shullivan,9," Thank goodness station HLN is astute enough to provide us with an endless string of reruns of this documentary true crime series
",I like many other television viewers have grown very tired of the decades old late night choices of TV talk show hosts and/or reality TV series. I am so grateful for HLN to have made the wise decision to run on almost a daily basis several episodes back to back of Forensic Files episodes. Using my PVR I pre-record them and then tend to watch them binging until I have exhausted the pre-recorded episodes.,/review/rw4825072/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2003,dtucker86,," Peter Thomas is a true hero!
","Forensic Files is a fascinating show and the jewel in the Court TV networks crown. It is like a real life version of Quincy. It is hard hitting and realistic and above all educational. We are so lucky today to have such amazing advances like DNA analysis and criminal profiling that would help capture criminals who not so long ago would have escaped justice for their crimes. Watching one episode is like eating one delicious potato chip, you just cannot stop. It is fascinating! Why just the other night they talked about the Malvo-Muhammad sniper case and the John List mystery. John List had murdered his family and escaped justice for almost twenty years and they made a bust of his face and showed what he would look like twenty years later. Thanks to Forensics and the power of America's Most Wanted he was finally captured and brought to justice fo9r the murder of his wife, mother and three children. The thing that makes Forensic Files for me is Peter Thomas the narrator. Simply put, he makes the show what it is. He makes it just like Leonard Nimoy made In Search Of... or Robert Stack made Unsolved Mysteries. He has got one of the best storyteller voices that I have ever heard. There is something else that you need to know, Peter Thomas is a true American hero. He served with the First Infantry Division in World War II and won the Silver Star and The Purple Heart. I write to celebrities as a hobby and recently wrote to Mister Thomas. He sent me one of the nicest replies that I have ever gotten. He even sent me a poem that he wrote about his experiences and the horrors of war that he saw.",/review/rw4825072/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2015,ccthemovieman-1,10," Four Reasons Why This Show Is A Winner
","Episode after episode, year after year, this program has been entertaining. It almost never fails. There is a reason it has been on the air for 15 years.",/review/rw4825072/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2016,OllieSuave-007,9," Show reminds you that there is no perfect crime.
","This show tells true crime stories of how the use of forensic evidence, from the identification of fingerprints to examining hair, and from tracking barcodes to tracking phone records, can lead to the location and capture of suspects. Each half-hour episodes start off with a mystery of an unsolved crime - intriguing and suspenseful. It then leads to a thrilling hunt of the criminal and the forensic attempts at tying the evidence to a suspect.",/review/rw4825072/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2014,sethmlanders,9," Fascinating!
","This is undeniably one of the best crime shows on TV. It's approach on suspense is top-notch and the wonderful narration is haunting. These are real life cases, with some reenactments, and it shows you how the crimes get solved with reliable forensics.",/review/rw4825072/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2005,okcpimpin,," Addicting true crime series..
","This was at one point probably my single most watched show.. The important difference between this show and most other forensic-y shows out there is that this one is based completely on actual cases. In the same vein as A&E's ""American Justice"" or Discovery's ""Cold Case Files"", but the running time of just 30 minutes (as opposed to an hour) makes this the perfect single serving show. The shows premise is true murder cases which were solved thru forensics, but I'm not a big forensics nerd so that part of the show, while interesting, doesn't necessarily intrigue me. What I do find fascinating is the little slice of life (death?) that is each episode. It chronicles what surely is the biggest event in most of the involved peoples lives. All of episodes (with very few exceptions) took place in America within the last decade or two, so for most of us these are events which may have occurred around us, relatively recently. As others have mentioned the pacing, narration, actual footage, photos, and interviews with those involved are well done and relevant. Each case is like a little mystery, and whats great is that of course you always find out who actually perpetrated the crime. My main critique is that occasionally certain facets or details of a case which I would like a little more clarification on are overlooked.",/review/rw4825072/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2002,dtucker86,," great show hope it runs forever
",I had previously written about how much I enjoyed Quincy and this show certainly reminds me of it.  A great episode every week about the wonderous advances in science that allows us to put people away.  It wasn't so many years ago that a lot of the perpetrators on this show would never have been convicted.  Each episode is crisp and compact and the guy who narrates it has the best storyteller voice that I have ever heard.  The only thing is that this show makes you realize that there are some pretty sick people in the world who do terrible things.  One episode was about a woman named Peggy Carr whose soda was poisoned by her nieghbor.  He gave her a poison that destroys the central nervous system and is one of the few of its kind for which there is no effective antidote.  She died the most painful death you can possibly imagine and her whole family became sick as well.,/review/rw4825072/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2002,ladyinterference,," great program with more pros than cons
","""Forensic Files"" is one of the more recent entries to the list of forensics programs out there on the TV landscape, but by no means is it weak from it. In fact, the program is the best thing that Court TV offers during its prime-time lineup of factual programming and reruns of dramas such as ""NYPD Blue"".",/review/rw4825072/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2006,bflood-3,10," Used to be ""Medical Detectives""
","I always laugh when I see people say ""Forensic Files"" is ""the latest entry into forensic TV"" or ""jumping on the forensics bandwagon"" or such. The show started on TLC/Discovery Networks as ""Medical Detectives"" back in 1996. When it switched over to CourtTV, Discovery was still running some episodes so they changed the name. (Now all those episodes are re-labeled ""Forensic Files"" and are seen on Court TV.) In fact, the show still airs as ""Medical Detectives"" in many countries overseas. (It is also known, I believe, as ""Crime Seen"")",/review/rw4825072/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2015,sickofenjoyingmyself,8," Fascinating, addictive watching
","Forensic files is absolutely fascinating. Throw in the fact that each episode is only about 25 mins long and you are onto a binge viewing winner. Every episode is interesting, educational and chilling. There is a bit of cheesiness to the voiceovers - but this adds to the experience and helps you to distance yourself a little from the true horror of the reality of the crime in each episode. Once you've seen one you know what to expect in general layout of each episode - and it's always comforting knowing that you will fine out who did it every time. But despite this fact each episode brings something totally new, and usually shocking. Would recommend if you like crime dramas/movies and are too busy to get into the thick of a new time consuming TV series.",/review/rw4825072/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,view_and_review,9," Spooked me more than any horror movie
","I was introduced to ""Forensic Files"" by a coworker while doing shift work. Let me tell you! This show is worse than watching any horror movie while on night shifts. I wasn't afraid for myself, I was afraid for my family at home while I was at work. Yet, I couldn't stop watching. I loved the myriad ways the various police departments were able to catch their perps. For squares like me it made me not even consider trying to get away with a crime.",/review/rw4825072/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2019,jogerig,9," My favorite way to unwind!
","This is my favorite true crime show. It doesnt go overboard with the reenactments, and I always learn something new each time. After a few episodes you get to know the formula, but that doesn't make it any less interesting. This is probably my favorite way to relax after a long day, which sounds strange, but the narrator's calming/ slightly cheesy voice and the super 90s background music help me tune out the world and relax. There are like 400 episodes, but I will keep rewatching them forever because no other true crime show gets me like this one.",/review/rw4825072/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2020,Faristuta,10," Can't even explain how great this show is
","Forensic Files is a fascinating show. Each episode is 22-minutes long, centers on an actual serious crime, and there's a solution at the end.
Law enforcement officials actually watch this show, even in a couple of cases they admitted solving a crime based on information they learned during the show. It can't get any better than that.
Occasionally the episode is about a mysterious illness that affected a town, but there's always a resolution at the end.
The narrator has this cool voice and he speaks with a well-balanced tone without much dramatization, which makes it more appealing.",/review/rw4825072/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2019,azathothpwiggins,," The Ultimate ""CSI""...
","A fantastic show throughout its entire run, FORENSIC FILES holds up to -many- repeat viewings. This is because it works on several levels: #1- As a police procedural, following professionals as they use their intelligence and forensic science to crack cases. Watching it over the years, it's interesting to observe the technology as it evolves and grows more sophisticated.",/review/rw4825072/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2020,bhowl87,10," As good as it gets
","This show set the bar for investigative forensic tv shows. Each episode is a mini documentary with no fluff, just cases and evidence. This show should have continued FOREVER.",/review/rw4825072/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2020,cedsidewinder,10," The absolute best of the best
","Forensic Files (the original series narrated by Peter Thomas) is, the best crime documentary shows ever created. I also think that narrator Peter Thomas, who passed away in 2016, had much, if not EVERYTHING to do with it. His voice, his timing was so compelling that it really added to the suspense and dramatic effect of the show.",/review/rw4825072/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2020,tay-sedai,8," Binge watched the whole series (not sure what that says about me ...)
","This might sound weird, but my beloved cat died a few years ago unexpectedly, and in my grief I started watching this show, and just couldn't stop. I don't know why I felt the need to continue on at the rate I was going, but the TV show was a good distraction.",/review/rw4825072/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 2001,jaspervanzyl,," Very interesting.
","""Medical Detectives"" is an extremely interesting series in which you learn about crimes been solved through the miracle of medical technology. The narrator is excellent and the stories carefully picked. But alas, like all other documentaries some episodes are quite boring, for instance the episode ""Killer Fog"". But even this episode managed to keep me intruiged in the scientists' brilliant minds. This series will keep me watching until the end of time!",/review/rw4825072/?ref_=tt_urv

13 November 2018,Nastybedazzler,10," Worth 10/10, easily.
",I loved this show. I stumbled upon it on Netflix maybe a year ago because I couldn't find anything else. I went into it assuming it would be one of those shows my grandpa would watch but it could be interesting enough to play it in the background while I do work around the house. After a couple episodes I stopped doing any work and was locked into the screen.,/review/rw4825072/?ref_=tt_urv
