25 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,7," Never played the games so I liked it!
","I never played the Halo games so I didn't really know what to expect but I have to say I really liked it. First off, Pablo Schreiber is such an underrated actor and does an excellent job in almost everything he does and he's great as the lead here. It seems that most of the people who don't like it is because it's not exactly like the video game. These shows need to be adapted for tv so there going to be a little different. Most people don't read the source material and don't care but I guess some of the ones who do know it do mind. As long as it's entertaining I've never cared if they change it up a little. This story is well written, the acting is good, and there's plenty of action and drama to keep you interested throughout the series. I absolutely recommend this to anyone who's a fan of sci-fi or action.",/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,8," Thought it was pretty good
",I actually enjoyed Halo a lot more than I thought I would. It's based off a video game about an enhanced super soldier they call Master Chief and his team as they defend humanity from Aliens and it takes place in the 26th Century. The special effects stand out as you can tell they put a lot of money into the show. It may start a little slow for some while it builds it world and it's characters but I found it extremely entertaining. It may get a little complicated for some if you don't pay close attention though. I enjoyed this show so much that I binged the entire first season over a weekend so I'm really looking forward to a more seasons!,/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2022,paradiddle16,6," PLEASE KILL OFF KWAN!
","Besides her, the show is alright. I just don't understand what Halo has to do with this annoying person and why the focus on her all the time. Master chief should have never rescued her.",/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,Maleplatypus,9," A small gem
","Played all the Halo games, read no Halo books. And it does not matter. This is really good. Looks expensive. Happens (obviously) before the first visit to any Halo ring and gives an insight to the universe around it. Good cast (although mostly unknown to wider audience) and their performances. Same for writing, direction, pacing, music, editing, the works. Everything is in place and there's a place for everything. Immersive and entertaining. I enjoyed every minute of the first season and am really looking forward to see what's next in season 2. There are some plot holes, of course, but nothing to write home about. However, most of the good TV-shows were cancelled or ended prematurely, while trash persists, so I'm also afraid a bit. So, if you like politics/action/drama/intrigues/tension/so on mix, this is just on spot. Reminds me of Expanse. Very well done. I hope I didn't jinx it with this impression.",/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,daniel-65836,8," Surprisingly enjoyable
","The last few episodes were great. Amazing visuals for a tv show, everything from the ships to the sets to the Covenant lizard models looked stunning. The Spartan armor were incredible. I watched it all the way to the end and liked it enough to write a review. You don't need to know the franchise to enjoy the show.",/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,nico-cba-16952,7," Fulfils its entertaining purpose
","Fanboys of the game don't understand that a game is a game and a show or a movie is a different media governed by different rules. Same thing don't understand fans of a book when adapted to audiovisual media. This kind of ""purists"" should stick to their object of fanaticism and just let ""common"" people enjoy or judge for what they see.",/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2022,Bigjuicybewbs,4," You can definitely skip episode 7
","Episode 7 is easily the worst of the series. 50 minutes and I'm waiting for the story to progress, but instead we are treated to a hallucination trip with a character no one cares about.",/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2022,ksgillihan,3," This is why we can't have nice things
","Halo is a concept and world that I have loved since the first days of the original Xbox. The first time I played Halo: CE I was blown away. The sheer vastness of the Halo ring and a singular character in green armor on the surface against all odds. After that, I played all the following Halo games and even read the novels. It is painfully clear to me that the writers failed to research some of the most basic things about key characters in this series. It wasn't even a good attempt.",/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2022,DongDiggity,2," Seriously, the bar is so low
","Knowing this was never going to follow the books or the games, I gave this a shot and it's a bore. After episode 7 I'm confident in saying this is screwed up. Only action is a couple of episodes while the rest are overlong dialogue and annoying backstory of Master Chief.",/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,lusciousmuffins,1," Shameful
","When you approach an intellectual property that you clearly do not respect or understand, there can be no good outcome.",/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,idonotexist,4," Cliched and unimaginative
","There is the clear trend in tv now to dump every possible plot element and random character in the pilot of a series in the hopes of appealing to every possible viewer. Then spend however many episodes they can squeeze on on stupid love story drama never giving closure to 90% of what they introduced in the pilot. Is this show going to be like that? Yes, the indicators are there that it will be.",/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,TVIsDead,2," If you've never played the game
","You still shouldn't be giving this high marks, the writting/CGI and characters are all attrocious.",/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,chris-16243,8," I'm giving this a high rating and I apologize for it.
","My dad got me into this game as a teenager. The show combines all the storylines into a completely different reality. I rated this as someone who'd never played the games because the show is amazing, but it goes against pretty much everything we know. WE were master chief. Now we aren't. We were able to do all of those things because someone was controlling us. Time wise this takes place somewhere between reach and CE, but everything about it is different from how we know it. I applaud it for being true to the game itself, but it is far from being true to the franchise and storyline. Even if you're a Halo fan, you'll find plenty to enjoy about this show, but it will make you question your existence in the same breath.",/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,Mike1113,9," Thought it was great
",I loved this show. While it's far from perfect it's still very good. I've played the game a few times so I kind of knew the story going in but even if I didn't I still would've loved it. You don't have to have played the game or even know anything about Halo to like this show. I liked it so much I plan on watching it a second time through again in the near future. The action scenes are just fantastic! The only part of the show I don't like that much was the character Kwan. Found her story to be extremely boring to the point I wanted to fast forward through her scenes. There hasn't been any word yet if this is getting renewed but I'm really hoping that it does. I've read that it got really good ratings so it should get at least another season.,/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2022,borismk-38942,1," It's poor outside of the action
","I could compare this to the games, and on those grounds it would do terribly, but I think I'd rather explain why it's trash on it's own merits.",/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2022,cbockiii,8," This Show is Far Better than I Heard
",A lot of my friends are loyal Halo fans and really bagged on this show when it came out. Over this year's holiday season I got a chance to binge it and I was....very surprised.,/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,rataserf,2," Bad story writing ignorant of the lore and deeply flawed
","Halo Lore was rich with excellent novels, games, comics and fan fiction. All of them excluding the Halo 6 had a much better story line and less annoying sidekicks. Halo 6/halo Infinite was a warning of what was going to happen to the Halo franchise with algorithmic story writing, but atleast the game play was good. Halo 2022 is what happens when good sci-fi story writing gets replaced by algorithmic garbage spewed by interns. I am pretty sure it is not getting any cheaper to produce these episodes. Please realize that 1 high quality writer > 300 strong internship assignments from non science fields spewed together by an algorithm.",/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,archangestelle,1," Is this the Mandalorian?

2 April 2022,bthigdon,1," Alright that's enough...
","Pop culture used to be fun. Now it's something else to be exploited by people who only care about money. Pandering isn't representation, it's manipulative.",/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,murphy-77692,4," 100 Million for 2005 CGI?
",-The characters have no weight to there movement. Its what made Black Panther look bad in fight scenes.,/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2022,stevebondi,8," If you can get beyond any differences it has with the game you love, this is an exciting, cool Sci-Fi show!!! :-)
","I have now seen all the video game cinematics/cutscenes from the 8+ games, all the shorts, and all the D2V movies. And although I have not played the game and am not a gamer, I can appreciate the sci-fi lore and the main characters in as much detail as the games have presented. However, I find that 3 episodes into this prequel series it is already providing more nuance and character detail to the mostly stoic hero in the games. For the most part, I have still pretty much been able to treat this as a stand-alone Sci-Fi series, and I thoroughly enjoyed the awesome action, great visuals, and the developing story! :-)",/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,badtripllama,2," WTF is even this ?
","I am currently halfway through the first episode and the chick, Kwan, what a seriously unlikeable character. Also, macguffin, probably the girl is going to be the key to ending the war or something... Not a good start.",/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2022,nonessentialpersonnel,1," Another 1-hit wonder show that turns into a soap opera after the pilot
","Starts off great as you would expect of a tv series based off a video game that is mostly about shooting aliens. I mean it! You will love the pilot and you will be hooked, but then in the following episodes, the soap opera will begin and fill the script with mostly meaningless conversations. First episode is what you'd expect on a show based on a game that's specifically about aliens, plasma guns, shields and swords, sniper riffles, massive space ships and enhanced super-humans in force field enhanced battle armor, instead, we get 5 to 10 minutes of good action every 3 episodes, with which they use to mask this yet-another soap opera as a live action HALO tv show and their lack of imagination and creativity. This is why I will never subscribe to these stupid streaming services. Paramount takes the L with this one.",/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2022,Deux_Vega,8," Surprised me
","Sure, I wasn't expecting much. The game itself had hardly any story, so what can you expect from a TV show? It's called a story in the ""Halo universe"", not so much a retelling of the games, so I'm fine they took the freedom to tell their own story. Otherwise, why bother producing It.",/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2022,boggie4758,8," So whats the problem?
",I understand I am a lay person and jumping into the Halo story cold so I am viewing this show with different eyes then some on here. I really didn't understand what the problem was. I know nothing about Halo or the story behind it making me not a Halo gamer or purest. I didn't know who the Spartans were or the military UNC. I don't know who the insurgents are and nothing about the covenant...so this first episode didn't really explain who these people are but for me it was pretty easy to follow and just seeing what was transpiring with all of these characters I somewhat understood it. I am sure I will understand more with more episodes but for now I thought it was really good. How it looks and the graphics looked good to me. I enjoyed it...hey I didn't know anything about The Mandalorian or Boba Fet because I really didn't like Star Wars and ended up loving these two series and with each episode I came to understand who these character were. I think it will be the same with Halo. I refuse to bash this series after just one episode. I usually wait until the 4th episode before I review a series but this first one in my opinion was good and peaked my interest. My opinion is totally different than the people who play Halo or read about it. Frankly I am glad I don't know any of those things so I can give this series a fair review and try to enjoy what I am watching.,/review/rw8008182/?ref_=tt_urv
