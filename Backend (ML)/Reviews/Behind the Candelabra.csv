19 January 2015,danew13,6," Hollywood Should Know People Want Happy Endings to Love Stories
",This had all the makings of a love story that could touch many people with nice performances all around. So why not have a happy ending and insure a much bigger box office? The story unfolded in flash back and present day rotation. It told the story of pair of star crossed lovers who through circumstance broke up and went their separate ways only to reunited 20 years later.,/review/rw5091301/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2014,jcmann01,10," Brought Tears To My Eyes!! It was THAT GOOD!
","I was looking for a nice romantic flick to bring my girlfriend to so it could set the mood for the evening. Well, that plan failed and I ended up bringing my ex to the movies to see it instead. It really touched me in a deep way that no other love story has in the past. Sounds kinda corny, but for me, it touched on some areas. Well, needless to say, we held hands all during the movie and more later.",/review/rw5091301/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2015,f-rabit,2," My wife made me watch it...then she apologised
","Cheesy, lame, clichés all over...it's so bad that I can't understand how is it even possible! How can a director make so bad decisions. I don't get it.The actors are not convincing at all. Overall the acting was mediocre and the lines...my god...the dialogs are deplorable. All about this movie is bad. The soundtrack. The dialogs. The plot. The story. And what about the main character? when he was young he had brown eyes and a long face. Twenty years after he has rounded face and blue eyes. lol lol lol How can this be? how can this pass? And did I talk about the acting? so bad! and did I talk about the dialogues? And could it be any more chliched? I guess not.Ridiculous movie.",/review/rw5091301/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2015,larsemann97,1," I loved it but then that happened.
","Yes, I am a boy. And gosh, I loved this movie so much. The romance were beautiful and oh-my so touching. But then, the directors had to screw it all up. Why not go for a happy ending? Why did he have to get shot? Why couldn't it just end with him beating up those two fellas and then take them to jail, and then get the love of his life? Why would you guys ruin such a nice movie with that ending? Well well. What can I say. ",/review/rw5091301/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2015,Bob-45,5," Trite story, bad direction, poor casting, barely redeemed by performances
","Good romantic films are almost as rare as good comedies. I really did not ask for anything special, as I like ""chick flicks"" and Hollywood has such a love affair with action movies, Hollywood has almost stopped making them. Nonetheless, I really disliked this one; because, even with the clichés, this movie had so much promise. The movie opens with a fine action sequence; and James Marsden is a really watchable actor. However, as soon as the parallel love stories begin, the movie falls apart. First of all ""young Amanda"" (Liana Liberato) not only does not look much like ""older Amanda"" (Michelle Monaghan), their body languages and acting styles are completely different. There is even a bigger disparity with ""young Dawson"" (Luke Bracey) and ""older Dawson"" (James Marsden). Thanks to terrific performances by Liana Liberato and Gerald McRaney, the flashback sequences are much more entertaining than the present sequences, even though Michael Hoffman's direction is much better in the present sequences. Hoffman shoots WAY too many of the flashback sequences as medium shots, when closeups would have been far better. Even the ending seems tacked on and trite.",/review/rw5091301/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2014,petarmatic,7," I enjoyed it!
","When my friend asked me out to see this film, I reluctantly agreed. I was very pleasantly surprised. My poor friend aged a lot over time, she looked for all of her life for a true love. She never found it. This film talks exactly about that. One of the lines mentioned is exactly that. Some people find true love, some look for it for whole of their lives and they never find it.",/review/rw5091301/?ref_=tt_urv

18 October 2014,s-quinn_2010,8," I Enjoyed This Movie
","I really enjoyed this movie, but I must give a disclaimer... I never read the book, so I can't base my rating on how accurately the movie follows the book. I found that this movie had a lot of twists in it and wasn't as predictable as most other romance movies. (Also, it didn't hurt that James Marsden is great to look at.) I thought the actress who played young Amanda was really good, and I loved seeing the story as the two were growing up & also in modern times. I'm not sure why this movie has gotten so much hate... I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and would even pay to see it again if I get the chance.",/review/rw5091301/?ref_=tt_urv

26 October 2014,JSplend954,2," Unfortunately this got ""The Best of Me""
","I believe all of Nicholas Sparks's movies are based on his books/novels, and they mostly center around Romance, Passion, and Tragedy. Sparks must be running out of ideas because to sum it up, ""The Best of Me"" was wayyyyyy to long, very predictable, and monotone to the point that it was listless.",/review/rw5091301/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2014,chloejane37,3," Typical characters with an average and predicable story
",I'm a big fan of Romantic movies and the odd cringey film but i found this so typical and predictable. For the first time ever even i managed to predict the end which wasn't worth the build up created by the rest of the film. During scenes that were supposed to be emotional and sad i found myself laughing at how unrealistic they were.,/review/rw5091301/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2014,tavm,7," The Best of Me was a pretty enjoyable Nicholas Sparks movie
","So my movie theatre-working friend was getting off from work in the afternoon today and he wanted to see another movie before going to his sister's house to watch the New Orleans-Green Bay football game there. So this was what we ended up seeing. I once again decided to humor him and to tell the truth, this was quite enjoyable despite some familiar clichés like bad boy-liking-good girl-who-he-has-to-break up-with-because-of-his-roots (well, there was more than that but you get the idea). The fact this was filmed and takes place in our home state of Louisiana was a plus for me and my friend as we recognized some town names being mentioned and certain car window stickers in the film. Yes, it's based on a Nicholas Sparks book and it has what you'd possibly expect from him. Still, by the time it all ended, we were both touched by what happened. So on that note, The Best of Me is worth a look.",/review/rw5091301/?ref_=tt_urv

6 June 2015,drpage-pagewizardgames,6," Very manipulative movie, has some inconsistencies, I liked the actors
","I watched this movie with my girlfriend and we were able to sit through it and enjoy the movie for what it was, but after we finished watching we just burst out in discussion about a lot of missed opportunities and strange inconsistencies in the film. The first thing that will grab your attention is one scene where they are talking while he tinkers with her car but puts his physics book down in the hood. You never see him remove it, so your mind races to think ""hey maybe she'll give it to him later"", but nope, never happens. On another note, it doesn't make sense to show one character to be drinking and about to drive, then in the very next scene have them go to the hospital due to an crash (drink and drive) that isn't that character, it's confusing.",/review/rw5091301/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2019,grahamvr,10," SPARKS MAGIC
","I just experienced one of the most romantic stories I have seen in years. For those who like the tears to flow this is the magic one from Nicholas Sparks. James Marsden is a dreamy as ever, every time you look into his eyes, he just takes you away. The story unfolds at a lovely pace, and brings everything together as it unfolds. I thought The Notebook was very moving but this one takes you on an incredible journey.",/review/rw5091301/?ref_=tt_urv

","Okay, I have to say that as a fairly grounded and realistic 54-year- old, I'm not all that into romantic movies, but my 14-year-old daughter wanted to see it. Nice eye candy in the actors, the houses and interiors are beautiful, but I found the movie pretty predictable throughout. Plus there were a lot of holes (ar, ar, no pun intended) so I kept wondering things like, shouldn't he have closed the window after he broke into the garage when it was raining? and if this is Louisiana, where are all the water bugs? (Not to mention, where are all the African-American people?)",/review/rw5091301/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2014,inkblot11,8," Best get your tissues ready for any showing, very sad but lovely story, beautiful scenery, too
","Dawson Cole (James Marsden, older and Luke Bracey, younger) works on an offshore oil rig. His performance as a rough neck is well respected. Unhappily, the rig catches fire one day and blows, but Dawson manages to rescue two men before he plunges over 100 feet into the ocean. Miraculously, he is alive, perhaps saved by a vision of a girl he knew long ago. That would be Amanda (Michelle Monaghan, older, Liana Liberato, younger). Shortly after, Dawson goes back home, having received notice that a dear surrogate father, Tuck (Gerald McRaney) has died. Amanda is there, too. At once, the film goes back to their senior-in-high-school days. Amanda was the pretty little rich girl. Unluckily, Dawson was the son of an abusive backwoods drug dealer. They met by accident, where Dawson was too stymied even to talk to this gal. But, slowly, a relationship developed. After another beating, Dawson ran away from home and stayed with the crusty widower Tuck, which enabled him to see more of Amanda. Love was strong and true between them. Yet, her dad disapproved and a crisis tore them apart. Now, 20 years later, they meet. Alas, Amanda is married with a husband, teen son, and memories of a daughter who died. But, will these two be able to resist the immense feelings of love that come rushing back? This beautiful movie should have romance fans crying oceans and sighing deeply. Forget the critics, they absolutely DO NOT KNOW HOW to review a female oriented movie any more. The cast is wonderful, the Louisiana setting is gorgeous, the costumes lovely, the script touching and the direction slow but analytic. Yes, this viewer didn't care for the ending, in which an added element was not needed to enhance the strength of the tale. But, all in all, fans best carry along a couple boxes of tissues, as this heartfelt flick will have tears falling like rain for all.",/review/rw5091301/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2015,danaalbasha,10," Bringing Out the Best of Love
",Nicholas Sparks is a very dramatic author. Most of his stories end in heartache if not all. He's not one of my favorite authors but I love the movies based on his books. I'm a sucker for old school romance. ,/review/rw5091301/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2019,redx1708,2," They kept adding cheese upon cheese.
","This review is probably one big spoiler, so you may not want to read any further, (although I'll recommend it if you don't wanna waste your time, and I should know cause i surely wasted mine), but here goes the plot. High school kids Amanda (WASP girl) and Dawson (white trailer trash) meet and falls madly in love. Then he goes to prison, and being all noble and sir Galahad, he refuses to see her anymore and tells her to forget him and get on with her life. So after sometime she marries an asshole husband and have 2 kids, one of them dying of cancer after 2 years.
Then after 20 years they meet again and find out that they are still madly in love. The plot works in 2 timelines, and you may wonder why the younger versions of the two don't bear any resemblance to the older ones. Anyway the guy dies and she's heartbroken, but it makes her get out of her marriage and supposedly live a happy and fulfilling life thereafter. So this is obviously a TITANIC sort of plot. No happy ending, no sir :) The problem is that everything is so predictable. Like the pregnant girl begging her boyfriend not to join the hero in a family showdown. (Right, this dude won't be coming back). Or when her son is fatally injured and needs a new heart, (oh, a new heart just came in, how convenient). Then the hero gets shot and killed by his dad, (gee, i wonder where his heart went). Years later the son finds out that the heart was from our guy,(BIG surprise !!) and when he tells his mom she smiles sadly, knowing that her true love will now always be a part of her through her son. I think this is where we're supposed to start ravaging the kleenex tissues, but at this point I had swallowed about as much cheese as i could possibly manage.",/review/rw5091301/?ref_=tt_urv
