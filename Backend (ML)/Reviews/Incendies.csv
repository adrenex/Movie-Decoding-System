10 July 2001,David-240,3," Someone get me a pair of scissors!
","What a great film this could have been!  The recreation of the attack on Pearl Harbor is some of the best film-making ever - an extraordinary and moving sequence made utterly believable by state of the art special effects. It ranks up there with the opening sequence from ""Saving Private Ryan"" and the sinking of the ""Titanic"" as one of the most harrowing ""disaster"" sequences filmed in recent years.  But like both those other two films, PEARL HARBOR is desperately in need of a decent script to frame the disaster sequence.",/review/rw0677949/?ref_=tt_urv

","(Please excuse my French, it's probably wrong)
 
 Roll up, roll up! See the cinematic spectacle of 2001! See the horrible 
 deaths of 2500 or so people commemorated by a film about two guys who 
 fly fast planes really fast. See them go ZOOOOOOOOM, see them go 
 WHIIIIZZZZ! See them reprise the 'flypast and debriefing' scenes from 
 Top Gun. Watch the beautiful love story unfold. See the true love two 
 people have for one another tested and broken when Kate Beckinsale 
 comes between them.
 
 See a fine young actor reduced to playing Token Black Guy. Watch as he 
 fights to prove he's more than a Token Black Guy, even though he's 
 given so little to do that he ends up as nothing more than a Token 
 Black Guy (even though, unlike the two guys in the planes, Token Black 
 Guy actually existed).
 
 Watch the awful bombing of a military target. Watch the heroic bombing 
 of a city. Watch Jon Voigt recreate Peter Sellars' unforgettable 
 character Dr. Strangelove.
 
 Watch the whole reality of war, and the lives and deaths therein 
 trivialised to make a Big Dumb Action Movie that thinks it's some kind 
 of ghastly tribute to the American dead of December the 7th.
 
 Or better still... don't!
 
 On the other hand, if you want an unrealistic film with ponderously 
 paced romance, fighter planes zooming all over the place and nice 
 explosions, check this out. It's a lot of fun. Just don't take it 
 seriously - you'll only encourage them!",/review/rw0677949/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2021,sophiahwright,10," I don't care what people say, I love this movie
","I don't care how much people hate this movie and how cheesy it is. It's entertaining, gripping, beautiful, romantic and a good old war/love epic i always circle back to time and time again. Plus Josh Hartnett in a pilots uniform? HEK YESSSSSSS!",/review/rw0677949/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2015,Screen_Blitz,7," Michael Bay's World War II is entertaining, yet deeply flawed
","For the past two decades now, Michael Bay has been known littering his films with countless explosions, and with this heavy special effects, garners wide success at the box office. Here, Michael Bay steps into the war genre with this intense, dramatic retelling of the fateful event that pulled America into World War II in the 1941. Set near the dawn of World War II, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett play Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker, two Airforce soldiers who have been best friends since childhood. As they grow up, they are caught in a love triangle when they both fall in love with beautiful nurse named Evelyn (played by Kate Beckinsale). Things get pretty complicated when Danny and Evelyn are transferred to Pearl Harbor where Rafe returns from fighting overseas in Great Britain to find the two are in a relationship. Next morning, December 7, Danny and Rafe wake up to find hundreds of Japanese fighter pilots dropping bombs on Pearl Harbor. The two friends arm themselves with the F-51s in attempt to fight off against the Japanese fleet. With the U.S naval base devastated and thousands of innocent lives lost, the U.S declares war against war. From there on, Dafe and Rafe and their army lead by Lieutenant Colonol James Dolittle (played by Alec Baldwin) prepare for a fight against Japan to overcome their country's catastrophic defeat. This film also features Cuba Gooding Jr. who plays Captain Dorie Miller, the first African- American in history to be awarded the U.S Navy Cross.",/review/rw0677949/?ref_=tt_urv

17 April 2019,joshhylto,8," I'm confused with all the hate of the film.
","I've never written a review before but after seen how many people are saying this film I thought I better.
I actually think the film was great the main premise of the film which I feel most people have completely missed is a bond between two guys that is as strong as a brotherhood hood. The alpha one who has the confidence to take over the world and the quiter one both who would die for each other in an instance. And maybe it was just me but I really did feel the emotions that they feel throughout the film. It seems like a lot of people hate the film so maybe I'm missing something but i think its a great film. The film is not totally accurate but films don't need to be and I film is long which is the reason I suspect it gets so much hate.",/review/rw0677949/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2004,bob the moo,," The action impresses, the romance plods, the dialogue is horrible, the characters are cardboard and the clichés grate
","Contains Spoiler!! A matter of weeks before he is due to leave for England having volunteered to fight with the RAF, Capt Rafe McCawley meets and falls for Evelyn Johnson.  He leaves very much in love with her but, when he is supposedly killed in action, his best friend (Danny) has to tell Evelyn that he is dead.  As they turn to one another for support and healing they gradually fall in love.  When Rafe is found alive he returns to America and finds his best friend in love with his girlfriend.  This complex love triangle is made even more complex when the Japanese attack Pearl Harbour and draw America into World War II.",/review/rw0677949/?ref_=tt_urv

","Oh dear, what a waste of time and money and more importantly, three hours of my life. Titanic with bombs, only take away James Cameron and any sign of talent, story, pacing and throw in historical inaccurancies, clichés and a story that will make you want to throw up from all the cheesy moments.",/review/rw0677949/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2005,muertos,1," An utter waste of money, talent and history.
","Pearl Harbor is a movie so spectacularly awful that it would be funny if it wasn't so infuriating. There hasn't been a big-budget re-enactment of the Pearl Harbor attack since Tora! Tora! Tora! in 1970, and, due to the utter failure of this movie on every level, it's unlikely it will be attempted again for a long, long time.",/review/rw0677949/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2018,Leofwine_draca,5," One good set-piece; forget the rest
","PEARL HARBOR is an attempt by Michael Bay to do what James Cameron did on TITANIC: create an epic romance surrounding a real-life historical disaster plot. Unfortunately, the romance takes the form of the cheesiest love triangle ever, with boring Ben Affleck and struggling Josh Hartnett competing for the affection of the entirely wooden Kate Beckinsale. This laborious, badly-written, long-winded nonsense means that PEARL HARBOR clocks in with a three hour running time, but the truth of it is that at least two hours of said running time is pure padded excess. No matter how many famous cast members they add to the mix, there's no getting around all of the cliches and the monotonous nature of the human interaction. The good news is that the attack itself takes the form of a forty-minute set-piece sequence which is quite exhilarating, utilising some very good CGI effects and non-stop explosive stunts to make it a truly impressive and immersive experience. The rest can be safely ignored, and if you're looking for a definitive version of this story, I'd recommend TORA! TORA! TORA!.",/review/rw0677949/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2015,D-Gal,9," Superb film - Believable acting - Well written - Severely underrated
","I seriously do not understand the utter hate toward this film by critics when writing their reviews. ""Historically inaccurate"" or ""Just another love story"" or ""boring!""... If you want to see a film that is totally historically accurate, watch a documentary for heavens sake. This movie goes way out of proportion to what really happened that day in Pearl Harbor, but it is a MOVIE! Get over it. It's not supposed to be real. ",/review/rw0677949/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2010,Jetset971,1," Leave it to Michael Bay to give action a bad name.
","First. This movie had great sets and decent actors and could have been something more than just window dressing if not for one major fly in the ointment...MICHAEL #@!$ING BAY!!! Why does this no talent hack continue to get work? I'll tell you why, because he has a sure fire formula working for him. He signs on to big budget flicks loaded with oodles of special effects and he knows all he has to do is launch all of the effects on the screen and people will pay big bucks to see it. Never mind the fact that every other element he is in charge of is going to suffer irrevocably. The Michael Bay motto seems to be, Bells and whistles to the point of irritation. I have never seen a movie of his yet where you couldn't stop groaning at the tired clichés, shotgun editing, and junior high dialouge.",/review/rw0677949/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2002,Smells_Like_Cheese,1," It was just awful and I just couldn't get into it
","I know that there are some ""Pearl Harbor"" fans, and I'm sorry but to be honest this movie is just trash. It seemed to me that the director just wanted to have a huge action movie and lost all the details that this event really happened. They just added a huge love story in it that wasn't memorable and also that they were trying to make another ""Titanic"". I was looking forward to this movie when it came out, because I had studied World War II religiously and I couldn't believe this monstrosity of a film.",/review/rw0677949/?ref_=tt_urv

30 July 2005,gftbiloxi,1," High Gloss Hollywood Eye Candy For The Brain Dead
","At one point during the attack at Pearl Harbor, a character says, ""I think World War II just started!""--ignoring the fact that no one used the term at the time. This is rather typical of the movie as a whole: obviously improbable, often flatly impossible, and flogging every cliché to the nth degree.",/review/rw0677949/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2001,Quinoa1984,3," One of the most manipulative movies I've seen in a real long time
","Pearl Harbor comes from that brought you Armageddon (which after further review is actually for me a lot lesser than what I once thought it was and shows what Fellini and Bergman can do to an under-developed mind) of Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer.  And like that movie, they make the audience cry and automatically feel patriotism at no extra charge.  That is not fair in many respects, especially during Memorial day weekend.  For all those who think Spielberg and his company make manipulative films (which is arguable), you should take a gander at this piece of work.",/review/rw0677949/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2008,Danielramos16,3," Epic Failure!!!
","OK the action sequences were fantastic, the music was wonderful and gripping, the Pearl Harbor attack was intense. It was, at many points, very emotional and made me a bit teary eyed because I felt for all the brave men and women who died on that fateful day in December 1941. Now let's get down to why this movie failed miserably:",/review/rw0677949/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2003,PlutonicLove,1," Thank you, Michael Bay, for making us laugh about love... again!
","John Hartnett and Ben Affleck star as dashing (as opposed to merely ""runny"") pilots in love with the same woman, a for the time surprisingly anorexic model type played by Kate Beckinsale. This love triangle gets so convoluted and unbelievable throughout the film that one almost expects Hartnett and Affleck to end up together, or possibly even a sexy soft-core three-way (Beckinsale: ""Oh... I just can't decide between the two of you, so I'll have you BOTH!"").",/review/rw0677949/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2006,srobi280,2," My turn to bomb ""Pearl Harbor"" with a bad review
","This movie is in league with Titanic. It is a story of a tragedy, turned into a sappy love story, which seems to be a trend in Hollywood. First of all, this movie is historically incorrect in so many ways, that I'm not even going to use up my energy listing the inaccuracies. Then again, when is Hollywood ever historically accurate?

They join the United States Army Air Corps in 1941 and both show an ability at being daring pilots while training under the command of Jimmy Doolittle, in Long Island...",/review/rw0677949/?ref_=tt_urv

","That song of ""Team America"" got it right. This must be one of the worst war movies that I've ever saw. It so dumb, corny and boring, that makes look ""Titanic"" as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" by comparison. What is more, I think that this was the attempt of Michael Bay to make his own ""Titanic"". Like all the things that he made, it was a complete failure. The only good thing were the visual effects. Besides that, this film is absolutely worthless, like the other films directed by Michael Bay.",/review/rw0677949/?ref_=tt_urv
