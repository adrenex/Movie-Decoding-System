25 July 2019,Bored_Dragon,10," ""Despite the fact that I'm a swirling black hole, I'm pretty faking awesome sometimes""
","After a series ""The X Files"" David Duchovny had planned to withdraw from the television, and I thought that I would in any future role still see him as Fox Mulder. I was wrong. With the role of Hank Moody, he immediately wiped all memory of Mulder.",/review/rw2377683/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2009,MRavenwood,9," I Did Not Want to Like This Show
","Maybe I missed something, but the promos of this series made it look like one long ad for a freewheeling guy living a hedonistic Hollywood lifestyle. That's SO not what Californication is about, and frankly, it's a stupid title. There is definitely a high volume of disreputable behavior, and the show is not for kids, but there is a good story here. Hank Moody (Duchovney) is a Los Angeles-based writer whose long-time girlfriend, with whom he has a child but never bothered to marry, has left him. The whole series is about his desire to win her back, his writers' block at the loss of his muse, and his role as a father all in the context of his emotional instability. Duchovney's girl-getting eyes have the same effect on every female opportunity that comes his way in the story as they do on his millions of female fans. The series calls for a bit of a stretch, asking the audience to believe that his power to attract women never once led to an indiscretion while he was living with his non-wife. I loved the characters and although it is not realistic, it is an interesting venue for the observations made about what destructive behaviors women are willing to put up with. It also gets very far away from the Jerry Seinfeld, man-child type characters that are romantically inept. Hank is a ladies man AND a man's man. He's the lovable bad boy with a heart of gold. For those concerned about content for kids: DO NOT WATCH THIS SERIES. There is constant language, smoking, sex, frank discussions about sex, drug use viewed as acceptable, nudity, and references to all forms of adult themes. But the story line is not as prurient as all of that suggests. Hank is a family man who engages in behaviors because he has no brakes to stop him i.e. his family living with him. He doesn't actually LIKE the behaviors and wants to marry the woman who left him and spend more time with his daughter. Great acting by the entire cast --and a *really* tall cast it is!",/review/rw2377683/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2007,tpaladino,9," Absolutely Excellent... Nothing Like It
","Its hard to explain everything that this show has going for it, and if the pilot is any indication, we are in for a fantastically brilliant series.",/review/rw2377683/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2007,yossarian100,9," Funny, witty, and wry!
","Duchovny is perfectly cast here as Hank Moody, and delivers his witty and wry lines with tongue firmly implanted in his cheek. Playing a talented but dysfunctional writer in the middle of a mid-life crisis, Duchovny's character is spot on. He can't pass a whiskey glass or a skirt and they even throw in a Porche for him to drive, in case your mind drifts. Only this is his mid-life crisis so we can laugh at it. It's OK. Natascha McElhone, having survived the Hungarian Revolution on The Company, gets to do something fun this time. This is good. She's both talented and HOT! ",/review/rw2377683/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2007,gpadillo,9," Duchovny's Back and He's Got the Goods!
","I can't remember when I laughed so steadily from start to finish of a new show. Family Guy? Perhaps. In Californication Showtime has one of its strongest hits . . . ever. The writing is bitingly crisp, intelligent and fresh. Duchovny's delivery has the timing of a master comic actor and his portrayal of Hank is winning. As with the very best of comedies, beneath the bubbly surface of Californication is a show that in a single episode reveals richly drawn characters of depth and purpose. Hank's lecherousness, womanizing, wry wit and in-your-face bluntness succeed only partially in covering up a complex (or perhaps merely complicated?) man who appears to be facing all of his mid life crisis's at once. Every note in this comic symphony was perfectly struck and I look forward to getting to know Hank - and the rest of his gang - better as the weeks go by. Bravo Showtime!",/review/rw2377683/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2008,dajes_s,10," must.watch.
","I can't talk about this show enough. It's just genius. I mean, it's so good it survived 75% of the advertisers pulling off after the pilot because of all the boycotts these sad little organizations were doing. It also survived a lawsuit by Red Hot Chilli Peppers on some crap about the name of their song and the name of the series.",/review/rw2377683/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2007,DVD_Connoisseur,," A solid new comedy series with top drawer performance from Duchovny
","From its controversial opening scene to its excellent finale, the first episode of ""Californication"" sets the tone for the series. Stylishly directed by the always-reliable Stephen Hopkins, the pilot is thoroughly entertaining adult comedy. Watching the first episode reminded me a little of a modern Blake Edwards' production.",/review/rw2377683/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2007,theladydragonfly,10," Intelligence, wit and sex in one place!
","This has to be one of the best written shows in years. It has so much going on and generally speaking, this is a recipe for disaster. The name tells you this is going to be about sex, drugs and rock 'n roll, and it is. It is also about love, tenderness, trying to keep kids from growing up too fast, dissatisfaction with life and settling for what you think you want.",/review/rw2377683/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2013,MovieAddict2016,9," A review of what used to be my favourite comedy.

12 September 2019,punkekahh,10," Perfect, balanced and totally unstable
","The drama is real, and is not forced at all (like most of the crap we're used to see around).
Dialogs and character's constructions, directing, scripts, everything is simply perfect in this sitcom.
Definitely a must watch.
I'm not the kind of guy that throws 10/10 around (only 5 movies and 2 series - Black sails and breaking bad), but this one is, beyond doubts, a 10/10.",/review/rw2377683/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2008,dead47548,10," One of the five greatest shows of all time.
","It's one of the five greatest shows I've ever seen. The writing is absolutely perfect and does a great job with both the comedic and dramatic scenes. David Duchovny's Hank Moody is one of the finest characters ever put to the silver screen and his performance is really what makes the show just so damn enjoyable to watch. The sex scenes were hilarious, and the entire story with Charlie (Moody's agent played by Evan Handler) and his secretary (Bully's Rachel Miner) started off very hot as they indulge in a Secretary-esquire relationship and then got hilarious once they started having a threesome with Charlie's wife Marcy (the hilarious Pamela Adlon) and his nipple gets ripped off and then Marcy actually sleeping with the secretary on her own.",/review/rw2377683/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2019,christophersarles,10," Watched entire thing many times!
","Sure there are plenty of scenes of naked women and debauchery BUT that's not the point. This series is the story of a man in love. Someone who knows what he wants, needs even, and also knows that his personal demons, that make him WHO he IS, will forever keep him from being who he longs to be. An emotional rollercoaster mixed with a constant, underlying humor. Give it a chance.. if you get to the third episode and can STOP watching, then you should, because you're never gonna get it, but if you can't stop watching, it just may change you a little.",/review/rw2377683/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2007,cynsunshine,10," Funny, cool, one-of-a-kind show for adults!
","If you have Showtime and you're not watching Californication, you're definitely missing out. I'm so glad I watched the first episode because I was hooked within the first five minutes and haven't missed an episode yet (I think it's up to 8 episodes now). I'm getting Showtime for free right now but just because of Weeds and Californication, I would probably continue paying for it after my free time is up.",/review/rw2377683/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2016,SnoopyStyle,7," great first season
","Hank Moody (David Duchovny) is a womanizing, hedonistic, self-loathing writer struggling to write in L. A. His baby mamma Karen (Natascha McElhone) is the love of his life but he could never take the big step to marry her. He's furious that she and their daughter Becca (Madeleine Martin) have moved in with her fianc√© Bill. Hank sleeps with a young woman who punches him during sex. He's shocked to find out that she's actually Bill's 16 year old, underage daughter Mia (Madeline Zima). On top of that, she starts using his unpublished works and steals his latest novella. Charlie Runkle (Evan Handler) is his idiot agent and Marcy (Pamela Adlon) is Charlie's on-again-off-again loud-mouth wife.",/review/rw2377683/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2018,DagRos,9," Excellent dark comedy and entertainment - pushing your comfort zone
","This is a show about the main character, Duchovny, been a famous writer with a midlife crisis, divorce and writing block living a quite limitless hedonistic upscale life in Hollywood. And on the surface it is about portraying a disrespectful lifestyle with a lot of sex, drugs, foul language and many times simple jokes under the belt. It is definitely not politically correct, which feels like a liberation watching. Note that 75% of advertisers pulled out after the first episodes, still the series survived. Californication definately challenged many taboos and boundaries when it started. And it still stands in a class of its own in these respects.",/review/rw2377683/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2014,RavenGlamDVDCollector,10," off to California again
","It deserves its top score and then some. I am collecting the box sets, and I've got the first five, and tonight I'm watching Saturday evening treat's Season 3 finale. The series ranks under my Top Choices as Best TV Show, and, indeed, film in general. It's better than almost any movie. I suppose people stay at home to watch this one if they don't have TiVo. I live in South Africa, and DVD is my pleasure of choice. And if you're thinking of adding this to your collection, do! The stories are cringe-worthy if you're watching this with family members, I suppose, so be aware that this is Adult Entertainment, not as a euphemism for pornography, but truly what entertainment for adults should be like. Something to sink your teeth into, and I'm not talking about Natascha McElhone, loads and loads of eye candy, and, yes, this includes Natascha McElhone, although she is the only regular actress on the show that is excused from having to appear in the compromising scenes, of which there are many. If ever there was a film character that makes a good impression, it is Karen, and Natascha will be remembered for this forever. Karen and Hank are so clearly made for each other, they click so resoundingly, that it is ten times more excruciating to see them going in opposite directions.",/review/rw2377683/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2011,the_wolf_imdb,1," The series is boring to death
","Well, I have probably not understood ""the magic"" of this series. I do not see the theme as ""controversial"". Sex? Marijuana? ""Controversial"" these days?

","In the show, you feel like you become the charachters. Yeah right like in all shows? No. You become Hank, Runkle, Stu, Karen, Becca etc. You feel what they are feeling in a way that no other show has given to me. This makes it so that everything that happens seems much more real. Events that happen affects your daily mood and can definitely make you laugh or cry all of a sudden. It is truly one of the best shows i have ever seen and according to me this is a ""must watch"" show",/review/rw2377683/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2008,jboothmillard,7," Californication
","I saw the advert for this programme and thought I'd give it a go, and turned out to be one of the most original comedy drama series in ages. The series basically sees the life of struggling, (for a while) uninspired and womanising writer Hank Moody (Golden Globe nominated David Duchovny, also producing). Mainly it sees his struggle to keep his career on track with the help of his agent, Charlie Runkle (Evan Handler), his relationship with ex-wife Karen (Natascha McElhone) and their daughter Becca Moody (Madeleine Martin), his sexual life, and just the general complications and situations in life. Subplot stories involving Charlie and his wife Marcy Runkle (Pamela Adlon), his secretary Dani (Rachel Miner), Hank's one night stand and tormenting bitch Mia Lewis (Madeline Zima), and sometimes Bill Lewis (Damian Young), the man who would marry Karen. The jokes can be quite rude, but they are certainly most hilarious, and I didn't expect a programme like this to have so much nudity, I look forward to more of it. It has been nominated the Golden Globe for Best Television Series - Musical or Comedy. Very good!",/review/rw2377683/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2007,cptnspoon19,9," Fresh, witty entertainment
","I just watched the pilot on-demand and I have to say I am thoroughly impressed by this show. David Duchovny was a pure gem to watch as the sardonic and hapless writer in the surreal realm of Southern California. The dialogue is top-notch, the plot is thick and juicy. Hank is a deep, 3-dimensional character that we seldom see on television. Though he is definitely damaged, there is something in his tribulations that audiences can relate to. His difficulty in writing is a situation I have felt many times when I sit down at the keyboard. Similarly, I empathize with his relationship problems. The problems he faces are problems that real people face brought to life in a very funny, unique way.",/review/rw2377683/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2011,lingerer-1,3," An old men's wet dream
","I watch this show every now and then, since the premise was an interesting one: the midlife-crisis of a modern bad boy in LA, the city where getting older isn't an option. The potentially good material is wasted in such a distasteful manner it's sickening. Untopped is the hypocritical morality the show tries to sell to the audience.",/review/rw2377683/?ref_=tt_urv
