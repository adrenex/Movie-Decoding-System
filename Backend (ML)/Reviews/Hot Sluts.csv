19 October 2012,xamtaro,9," The fan-favorite classic: Expanded, elaborated and faithfully replicated
","One of the most beloved Batman tales finally gets the animation treatment. So influential was Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns"" that it inspired Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan when they were crafting their live action Batman movies, as well as the 1990s Batman animated series (which gave birth to an entire universe of DC animated shows). Warner decided to split the tale, originally spread over 4 issues, into 2 movies. Turns out that it was an excellent decision which not only successfully adapted the first half of Frank Miller's epic, but added layers to the story and characters that the limited page count of the graphic novel could not leave in.",/review/rw6960572/?ref_=tt_urv

26 September 2012,DarthPaul85,8," Excellent adaptation of the graphic novel!
","After seeing Batman Year One, I was nervous about this one, but I was pleasantly surprised! The story is faithfully recreated here, with very little censorship of the violence, and most of the (included) dialogue straight from the pages of the comic, albeit with some forgivable changes. The pacing is excellent, and really captures that sense of ""awesome"" that the graphic novel had. The visual style is ""close enough"" to Millar's work to give you flashbacks, but of course it lacks the detailed nuances of the comic. And lastly, the music fits everything perfectly.",/review/rw6960572/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2012,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,8," Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1 (2012)
","The Dark Knight Returns, is for me, the best Batman film of the year. The animation is superb, especially when the action kicks off. It sees Bruce Wayne return to crime fighting after a 10 year absence. Unlike his Nolan counterpart however, he was Batman for a damn sight longer than just a year. His return is depicted as an obsession that finally grabs control and pulls him in. He barely even notices it when he shaves off his mustache as it just becomes a natural part of the process. A new threat, called The Mutants, rises in Gotham, and Batman has to sort them out. His age becomes his weakness as he must go up against the leader of The Mutants. he film is littered with cuts to TV shows and newscasts discussing whether or not Batman is a help or a hindrance. Peter Weller does a great job as the voice of Batman, and it's nice to see a Batman with a dark and dangerous sense of humour. As an adaptation it remains fairly close to the source material, but manages to capture the ferocity of the violence without being too graphic. Gotham looked and felt exactly how I remember it when I was growing up. This is great stuff, and is a huge tease for Part 2, where we will see The Joker once again.",/review/rw6960572/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2012,DJayXIII,10," You don't get it son. This is an Operating table and I am the surgeon...
","A wonderful translation of the Frank Miller Novel brought to life on the Screen. Animation was excellent, the Tone was perfect and when watching this Animated Movie, I felt completely drawn in to the world that Frank Miller had created back in 1986. The movie was amazing and I cannot wait until Part two comes out. The second half of part 1 really set the tone for part two and it really leaves the viewer in anticipation - with a big smile...",/review/rw6960572/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2016,utgard14,7," ""Chicken legs, lickin' legs. Slice and dice!""
","First part of the animated adaptation of Frank Miller's classic comic book miniseries, The Dark Knight Returns. The comic was highly influential on the direction of superhero comics over the last 30 years. It tells the story of how Bruce Wayne returning to being Batman after a ten year absence and how the world has changed without him. This first part deals with Batman return to battle a gang known as the Mutants that is terrorizing Gotham, as well as the release of Harvey Dent (aka Two Face) from Arkham Asylum.",/review/rw6960572/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2012,behy7000,10," Amazing! (spoiler free)
","I'll be short. I'm an 90-ties kid (now 21) and I watched a lot of batman cartoons and movies, and even read the comic on which this movie is based on. The movie shocked me how good it was made, the animation, the acting (even though batman isn't voiced by Kevin Conroy), even the sound is simply great. ",/review/rw6960572/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2012,drqshadow-reviews,8," Excellent Adaptation That Falls Just Short of Epic
","An impressively loyal adaptation of one of comics' most important stories, complete with social commentary, nods at dark chapters of the character's history and a glut of wanton brutality. Despite being ripped violently into two pieces, the story still functions very well and reaches a natural climax in time for the credits to roll after a drawn-out 75 minutes. I fear the end result may be a less-dense arching plot line, especially as most of the political commentary was removed from this chapter (presumably as it won't be relevant until the second) but there's still more than enough pulp to go around. While the storyline is doggedly faithful (indeed, most of the dialog is copied verbatim from the source), the artwork is both influenced by and notably distanced from Frank Miller and Lynn Varley's amazing work on the printed page. And, while that does rob the story of some of its character, the result is suitable enough; fresh but also familiar. Peter Weller turns in some decent work as the voice of Bruce Wayne, but I couldn't help but daydream about how Kevin Conroy would have approached the material. Very good, if not perfect.",/review/rw6960572/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2013,rhiron,8," You're Never Finished With Me
","Before I watched this animated feature and its second part, 'The Dark Knight Returns - Part 2', I had considered animated features based on the 'Batman' mythos to be quite a cosy way of filling an otherwise empty evening. They had their own level of violence that, at times, could be a little too graphic, but they were still a guilty pleasure of mine.",/review/rw6960572/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2013,TheLittleSongbird,9," The thrilling return of the Dark Knight
","The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1 is not the best of the animated Batman films (Mask of the Phantasm overall and Under the Red Hood in recent years), but I still found it terrific and see no problem with any Batman or superhero fans enjoying it. For me it wasn't entirely perfect, the ending did seem rather abrupt, if even more of the characters' inner thoughts had been written in the writing could have had even more depth than it did and David Selby's Gordon seemed rather monotonous for my tastes(Bryan Cranston would have been a better choice maybe). However, there is much to love about The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1. The animation is great, there is a lot of crisp detail and atmosphere and everything is drawn beautifully. The music score is haunting and adds so much to the atmosphere, while the sound is so authentic that you feel that you are actually there in the story and action. The writing is very intelligent and thought-provoking, the action scenes are beautifully edited and exciting and the story is very compelling, managing to expand on the source material while also being faithful to it, with the right grittiness. The voice acting is fine generally, Selby was my only real reservation. Peter Weller had a intense subtlety for Batman that was just right for the tone of the film and Ariel Winter was the epitome of the spunky teenager, as stereotypical as that sounds she and the writing find a way around it that doesn't make it seem that way. Joker's part was pretty much only a cameo consisting of two lines, so he and his voice weren't an issue in the way that he was for others. All in all, a thrilling and excellent return without being the best of Batman. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw6960572/?ref_=tt_urv

","There has been a few really good straight to DVD Batman animations, but this one takes the cake. Having watched the last installment of Christpher Nolans Batman on the big screen, this little piece just keeps the fire burning. Im so impressed by the attention to detail and story line that i wont even begin to give you the low-down/plot, you just need to see it for yourself. Any fans out there will be glad to know this is part one of a series and when you watch it, you'll see how the story drives you straight into the cliff hanger , all the elements are there ,even as we get to understand that Batman/Bruce Wayne has aged significantly it doesn't slow down the action, after all ""Old Heroes never die , they just get Darker"". i cant wait for part II . Well done and Respect to the Director and his crew for putting this together so well.",/review/rw6960572/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2013,I_Need_More_Cowbell1969,10," Why This Is The True Batman Film
","There are some reviews panning the storyline and animation style. Understandable if the only Batman you really knew was the 90's Kevin Conroy version (which is excellent btw). While I know I'm not unique regarding this, my perspective of this film comes from growing up in the 80's on the Batman comic books. Batman in the mid 80's was still trying to shed the Adam West live action & the Superfriends animated image people had of the character. Then came the Crisis On Infinite Earths epic. It really made bad things possible to DC characters. Characters didn't always get a noble end. Then Frank Miller looked at the Batman character blowing in the wind without substance and said ""No. THIS is what he is."" and hence Batman: The Dark Knight Returns graphic novel.

12 September 2012,yaktheripper,7," Good..but lacking
","Frank Miller's ""Dark Knight Returns"" comic book revolutionized not only Batman but comic books in general. The cartoon attempts to capture Frank Miller's classic but while watching it I found it curious that after all the money and talent attached to this project...it feels a little empty. I'm not saying it's not a good animation, because it is. It excels at capturing the brutal fight sequences that an older Batman faced in his return to the mean streets of Gotham, especially well. Many scenes are captured straight from the comic and animated as Miller had drawn them. However, in the end I felt this just isn't the treatment that the classic deserves. The animation, outside the action scenes is sometimes dull. Frank Miller kept the non action scenes in the comic visually dynamic by breaking up panels and using interesting page designs to keep us involved and turning the pages. In short, this movie just wasn't gritty enough. The animation is too clean. Yes there's blood, and mud, and broken limbs...but this sort of treatment needed layers of filth and sweat. We needed internal dialogue of a senior citizen Batman going through motions he hasn't committed in a decade. The voice work, lead by Peter Weller as Batman, also lacked the grit to convince us this is Frank Miller's original vision of a Batman who is old, in pain, fed up, and a Gotham City moving in to a new violent direction sans the old crowd. If you read the original and love it...you'll probably like this. If you never read the original, you'll most likely love it.",/review/rw6960572/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2012,Mr-Fusion,7," Welp, they did it. They actually adapted ""The Dark Knight Returns""

30 August 2014,Quinoa1984,9," ""Surgeon... operating table"" you know the drill
","This animated movie - the first part that adapts the first volume of the Dark Knight Returns (or, I guess it was four parts, so the first two parts) - is about as good as this comic can get. It's an animated movie, but it is able to bring the comic to life with just enough of that Frank Miller grit and action while still being somewhat, kinda, sorta, appealing for younger audiences (the original series was probably more for adults than kids despite it being Bats).",/review/rw6960572/?ref_=tt_urv
