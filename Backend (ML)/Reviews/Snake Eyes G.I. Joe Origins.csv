17 December 2021,deothor,6," It's fine..... at best.
","I'll be honest here. I was slightly hyped up when i heard of Rumble in 2020. It felt like great concept. Obviously I didn't know anything about the plot, beyond it being your basic ""zero to hero"" stuff.",/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2021,ozorjustin,8," Quite Fun

3 January 2022,bolomark,7," Pretty Good Family Movie, Funny and Good Animation.
","Funny, Witty, Entertaining and Well done. There were a few things that they could of done without such as the tattoo dude in his underwear. There are a few instances of innuendo that kids won't get but is funny for the adults. This was really well done for the most part and has a pretty good message of being yourself and using what you enjoy to become great as well as making your own destiny rather than trying to live other's destinies. This does have gambling and the underground in it, it also has tattooing and tattoo removal in it regarding a super-fan in his underwear, so if that's a big deal for you then don't watch. However, this is a good and clean family movie that was well done. It was funny, cute, heartwarming and entertaining. This is wrestling at its finest without the language and other obscenities as with ""Real"" wrestling. It was a surprise that we all enjoyed.",/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2021,steveg7489,8," Good family fun
","My kids like monsters and wrestling, so this was a great mash up. I did find it somewhat funny that they did incorporate some WWE names in this not only as voice actors but for the wrestling venues and matches as well. Nice touch",/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2021,rickothan,7," Calm down y'all
","It's fun. It's not a pixar masterpiece, it's not an emoji movie level disappointment. It's a fun time, it's a well made movie, and it has the creativity behind its monsters to boot. Didn't disappoint for me. Sure, it has some corny moments and some moments that do not make sense, but it's a fun time. Check it out, it could be for you.",/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2021,EvanoOruvan,6," You know the drill..
","Its an underdog story about a monster whose father was greatest wrestler of all time and a coach whose father handled the greatest monster.. So, two underdogs pair up together and you know what happens next..",/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2021,stevebondi,7," Cool concept with mostly decent animation :-)
","Movie was enjoyable (Kaiju WWE with a innovative Salsa dancing fight technique), but animation was not top tier, especially with simplistic human designs and animation, and inferior fur :-(. Nevetheless, there were some funny pop references to LeBron/Cleveland and Creed/Rocky, among others :-)",/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't really know what to say about this Paramount animated movie, other than saying the trailers didn't give me any hopes for it being good.",/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2021,sbf-26502,8," Family fun.
","In one word, this movie is fun! It is both entertaining and amusing, and can be enjoyed by the whole family. The plot line is simple but that does not negatively affect this type of movie, and the animation is crisp and clean which makes watchability very easy.",/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2022,cybexhunter,8," Kept the kids quite
","I liked the animation very good the story was good and it's a nice film all round, some funny bits, kids liked it and I enjoyed having a new animated film with a wrestling theme. Very good.",/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2021,IonicBreezeMachine,4," A by the numbers sports story with good animation, but little character resonance or substance.
","Set in a world where mankind and giant monsters live peacefully side by side, the entire world follows the competitive sport of Monster Wrestling wherein a town's monster alongside a human coach engage in matches with monsters from other towns. The town of Stoker-on-Avon was once home to the greatest monster and coach team of Rayburn and Jimbo Coyle before they were tragically lost at sea and presumed dead. Sometime later Avon's new monster, Tentacular (Terry Crews), becomes the world champion only to announce immediately afterwards he's abandoning Avon for a lucrative deal with the town of Slitherpoole. With no monster to justify the upkeep and maintenance of the Jimbo Coyle Stadium the town reluctantly decides to sell the stadium to be demolished for a parking lot which doesn't sit well with monster wrestling fan and Jimbo Coyle's daughter, Winnie (Geraldine Viswanathan), who sets out to find an unknown she can coach in the hopes of saving her father's stadium. Following many rejections, Winnie eventually stumbles across childhood friend and Rayburn's son Rayburn Jr.(Will Arnett) who is now taking dives for low rent matches under the name Steve the Stupendous. With Rayburn Jr./Steve now in debt for a large sum of money for winning a fight he was supposed to lose, he reluctantly goes to Avon with Winnie to train as a serious monster wrestler with a massive uphill journey for the both of them.",/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2021,jason_riddle11,8," A Real Review!
","The movie had a lot of life lessons that apparently no one noticed. Which is pretty laughable considering critics are supposed to be the ones to notice more about films. For instance the announcer Marc Remy went from hating Rayburn jr to liking him only after his success. Lesson being people change up only when it's convenient. Then there's the biggest lesson of the whole film, that being a spawn of a superstar doesn't mean you have to live up to their name and that you can create your own path.",/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2021,djurrepower,6," There was an attempt
","I can see somewhat of a good story in this film. But honestly, the script could have gone through some extra drafts. Most plotpoints are loosely connected at best, and this comes at the expense of investment in the film. So all in all, it was decently made and executed. But the foundation was quite lacking.",/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv

",Rumble is a pretty good film that appeals to kids and adults alike.,/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2021,ops-52535,6," not much new ...
","To learn for a wrestling fan, all the tricks has been done before( i guess ), and i do have a struggle getting familiar with the main caracters, so a really generic classic animation shower for all of you who like monsters and fake resling.",/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2022,margineanvladdaniel,7," It wasn't that bad but
","It lacked something, seemed rushed, boring, monotone, predictable. It was a interesting idea though, I liked the last fight, pretty fun and innovative, but that was about it. I hope they will make a sequel, a better one.",/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2021,SnoopyStyle,5," marginal animated movie
","In a world where monster wrestling is a popular global spectator sport, major cities have their own monster stars. The small town of Stoker has their champion Tentacular until he decides to take his talent elsewhere. In fact, the big city wants to turn Stoker's stadium into a satellite parking lot for its own stadium. Winnie Coyle wants to follow her manager father's footstep and find a new star monster. She finds Rayburn, son of a champ, throwing matches in underground fights.",/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2022,avindugunasinghe,10," An engaging story and an excellently animated movie
",Good family friendly movie. Colourful and Cheerful. Movie makers hasn't avoided the challenging task what you expect is what you get. Simply awesome and fun.,/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2021,Gordon-11,," Not likable
","The animation not likable in many ways. The monsters all look very ugly, and I can imagine going children crying when they see these characters. The human characters are not charming either, and it is unlikely that children or their parents will bond with the human characters. The story is boring and uninspiring.",/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2021,runawaystork,8," Good kids movie
","This is a fun movie my kids an I enjoyed and have watched a couple times. It's not some big budget all star movie, but I think it's one of the top of it's class when I compare it to similar garbage Netflix kids movie.",/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2021,samherrera-99957,10," Amazing
","The movie was awesome. Although it could've been longer and sometimes the sound quality was cut up a bit but other than that, the movie was great. There were some scenes in the trailer that were changed to make more sense but it was actually really good. My one problem is that it wasn't in theaters and it really should've because it's about giant monsters. But it's amazing.",/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2022,Badmovieboy123,7," Enjoyable for all. Extra enjoyable for wrestling fans of cameos.
",Acknowledge him. The tribal chief has a cameo. Lol nah but forreal an original idea and a usual delightful performance from will Arnett..solid animated film which entertained me and 7 year old for an hour and a half.,/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2021,TheMysteriousReviewer,5," A Generic Underdog Wrestling Movie
","I'll give it this that the movie does have a bit of surprises from my expectation, but Rumble is still a generic kids film. It did have some material to be an enjoyable movie with a nice concept of monsters wrestling and great animation that gives unique designs and wrestling moves. But judging the way I look at the trailers, it ended up having a generic and predictable underdog story with nothing new to offer. The humor is pretty weak. And the characters are an entire mixed bag that are either enjoyable or just plain lazy like Steve. My recommendation would have to go with the WWE fans since this is made by the studio. So maybe they'll get a kick out of it. But to anyone else, there's honestly better brawl films. Including the one that came out earlier this year, Godzilla Vs Kong. That doesn't really have the best writing, but it was nicely executed the way it tells the story of the brawl audiences would get hyped of and could be the best MonsterVerse film so far. With this film, I won't say it's as terrible as I thought it would be. It's there are better brawl films out there.",/review/rw7666443/?ref_=tt_urv
