20 November 2022,sarahilayda1,4," Very disappointing
","So I loved the first movie, it's one of my favourite movies and I think it's one of the best Disney contents ever. This is exactly anything but. I didn't have the highest hopes but this is just disappointing in another level. They really did the original movie injustice and I'm surprised they got all of the actors with this script.",/review/rw8682061/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2022,david-thor,," No spoilers needed; the negative reviews say it all
","I could watch Enchanted any time I want to feel better about the basic goodness of people - and that is what is missing in Disenchated. Apart from James Marsden's dimwitted return as the Prince, and finally letting Menzel sing (albeit a forgettable song amidst a sea of forgettable songs), there's nothing to recommend here. It's a sequel that shouldn't have been made, or at least not by a group of writers, which appears to be the case here. Same cast as Enchanted, Amy Adams actually looks even nicer this time around, but what a godawful story they're stuck with - it's just a mish-mosh of set pieces, each trying to set up the next piece, and failing. As was the case with Hocus Pocus 2, Disney has lost its way.",/review/rw8682061/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2022,tpindustries,4," Could've been better
","My main issue with the film is it could've been better, there were some interesting ideas presented rather than just rehashing the original in a dulled down way as most sequels do, the cast were great although writing-wise the character development from the first film had basically vanished and the new characters were somewhat forgettable, still some funny moments but not as memorable as the original, similarly the songs were not as memorable as the original either, lots of abandoned plot threads and characters that had no role in the story but were just kind of there, it feels unfair to compare this to the original since that was over 14 years ago, time flies, but I just think there wasn't really a reason to make a sequel to the first Enchanted",/review/rw8682061/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2022,sunisfun-99372,2," I was definitely disenchanted watching this
","First off, the age of the actors is off. You have a couple in their 50s with new baby, sorry... Robert is old! Giselle turns into the wicked step mother(like that hasn't been done a billion times), Malvina, as a regular citizen has two ladies beside her at all times like old loyal dogs which would be normal in a teen flick, and there's just no story to it. You have bits and pieces of many Disney films all smashed together in one and it's tacky and cringe. The singing and dancing was typical Disney ballroom blah but more than anything.... The song they have Menzel sing is repetitive and annoying. She's yelling, not singing and the same line over and over. Not an ounce of creativity IMO like the first one was. Should've left it alone.",/review/rw8682061/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2022,rosariokinnaird,5," Another mediocre sequel.. sadly
","If Enchanted wasn't going to win any oscar, the movie was original, music was refreshing and the balance between fairytale and humour was holding fine.",/review/rw8682061/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2022,cyrese-65547,2," Disney is the McDonald's of Hollywood
","Another Disney disappointment, as we seem to keep getting a near nonstop stream of these. I really wanted this to be better, I wanted to like this way more than I did. There are not many Disney projects I want to see succeed at this point but this was an exception. I loved the original Enchanted, I thought it was a great deconstruction of a lot of classic Disney tropes but it was done in the way where it was executed as affectionate parody. The love was still definitely there. But with this sequel, the only true redeeming factor here is Amy Adams. The other supporting actors are either phoning it in or overacting. The high schoolers were very unnecessary. All in all, this movie is just a reminder that you can be watching the far superior original. ""Disenchanted"" indeed. Don't waste your time.",/review/rw8682061/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2022,DanteMonteverde,5," Disenchants the first one
","Disenchanted delivers a cliche story that loses the charm of the first film. It manages to siphon out everything that made Enchanted great, whilst adding a forgettable villain into the mix, and numerous plot holes, that had me scratching my head at times. Performances were as good as they could be with the lackluster script, and the climax of the film came off as shallow and underwhelming. This movie is just another Disney reboot and I wouldn't recommend watching it.",/review/rw8682061/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2022,bmbelko,2," No.
","The first movie was charming, disarming, quirky, with catchy song lyrics and lines. This one, an hour in, was painful to watch. No really lovable characters, everyone overacts instead of just Amy Adams, which was her success in the first one. Now we have chipmunks, high schoolers, neighbors, husbands, magic scrolls, everything overacts. Three adults sat in pain and finally switched it off. Perhaps seven year olds would like it. The overdone NYC accents are funny for a bit nut, unlike Rizzo, quickly become annoying. I give it 2/10 stars. I'd give it 1/10 but I reserve that for Ed Wood movies.....",/review/rw8682061/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2022,IonicBreezeMachine,6," The cast are clearly having fun and there's some solid visual magic on display, but this outing feels curiously more muted than its predecessor
","Roughly a decade after the events of the last film, Giselle (Amy Adams) and Phillip (Patrick Dempsey) along with Phillip's daughter Morgan (Gabriella Baldacchino) have continued to live as a family including welcoming a new baby, Sophia, into their lives. With their larger family and relative smallness of their apartment, Giselle and Robert decide to move to Monroeville believing the change will be good for them much to the annoyance of Morgan who's now a teenager and dealing with the typical angst with which that entails. Following a fight between Morgan and Giselle, Giselle makes a wish using a wand she received as a present from Edward (James Marsden) and Nancy (Idina Menzel) in Andalasia for her life to be more like a fairy tale which results in Monroeville becoming more magical as a result, but with the price that Giselle is turning into a wicked stepmother.",/review/rw8682061/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2022,Escapist-2802,6," Disenchanted is missing its personality
","In the new movie, ""Disenchanted,"" the bulk of the actors and crew members from the earlier film are back. Everyone who is reprising their roles does an excellent job of ageing the characters while keeping them recognisably the same people they were in the previous film.",/review/rw8682061/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2022,mr_bickle_the_pickle,7," Not as good as the original but still lots of fun.
","Was it as good as the original? No, but it was still highly entertaining. I liked that they actually did something new with the story. So many sequels just basically end up doing the same story as the first. And Amy Adams was clearly eating it up as a villain. She was **wicked** fun. Plot wise, I loved the focus on the mother-daughter dynamic, although I could foresee how the spell would be broken from a mile away. And although Patrick Dempsey gets to have a bit more fun by partaking in the singing and dancing I feel like he has a kind of useless B plot. He definitely isn't as important as he was in the first. I thought they did a good job casting with Morgan. I seriously didn't even realize that it wasn't the original actress. A lot of the sets and costumes actually reminded me a lot of the Brandy Cinderella movie. They definitely didn't look cheap and they were full of whimsy but also didn't look fully cinematic either. The songs were very good too. I don't know if they will be as iconic as the original movies, probably not. But still overall good. I think my favourite might be Idina Menzel's memory song. Also just like the first, there's lots of fun Disney Easter eggs to look out for. It was a lot of fun and a pretty good sequel in my eyes.",/review/rw8682061/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2022,PrinceCharmingHere,5," Overlong, middling sequel
","So, nothing happens for the first half hour. Literally. It's like an episode of the Gilmore Girls or some CW family drama. Family moves. Awkward and homely looking daughter who doesn't fit in. Mia Rudolf plays the same character she did in the movie Sisters. Blah blah blah. It takes forever to get to the actual good stuff, plot and magic that we came to except from a sequel to Enchanted. By this point I didn't even want to watch the rest. The villain sucks. This movie is still much better than the atrocious Hocus Pocus 2 by a long shot, so it has that going for it. The music was nice and the legacy characters did good. Needed to trim some of the run time and cut some of the family drama at the beginning that went on for why too long and should have had a more interesting villain. Definitely disenchanted.",/review/rw8682061/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2022,lottie-lc,4," The clue is in the title
","""Enchanted"" mesmerized me back in the day as a kid, and did not lose any of its charms when I rewatched it lately as a grown-up. The sequel, however, lacks the original's cleverness, excitement and warmth (or enchantment, if you will).",/review/rw8682061/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2022,godgirlprincess,8," A Sweet Sequel
","The first film Enchanted holds a special place in my heart. It came out shortly before I wed and gained a beautiful 4 year old step daughter. That movie was a nice depiction of having a ""good"" step mother. The film Disenchanted now debuts with my step daughter being 18 and there has definitely being some contentious moments between us. I thought it handled the bond between the 2 beautifully, and was more a love story between mother and daughter than anything else. And while there did seem to be times they make the males characters clueless do-nothings, which I hate, this film did seem to show them to be chivalrous and helpful. The final moments made me cry because it reminded me of my step daughter and how much I love her and how strong our bond can be, even though we aren't ""connected by blood"".",/review/rw8682061/?ref_=tt_urv

23 November 2022,Batsy1501,7," Not so bad!
","Although I've seen quite a few people criticize it, I thought it was fine. Like the original and many other Disney films, it was a charming musical with touching scenes and lessons about life. This script wasn't particularly bad or anything, but I can't dispute that the first one's was much better. Still, the movie provided some lovely musical selections and entertaining moments, which I anticipated. The characters' poor and peculiar character development, particularly for Morgan, must be the worst part. I mean, it's been years, but Giselle is still just like the first day she came to New York, and Robert received insufficient screen time, which led me to believe that he is only in this sequel since he appeared in the previous one.",/review/rw8682061/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2022,brulein-257-374862,6," A musical?!?
","Enchanted has got to be one of the most brilliant Disney movies out there. A Disney movie that parodies everything ... Disney! Not only was the story original and fresh, Amy Adams was a comedy revelation and her over the top Disney Princess was comedy gold. And then there's Disenchanted. First off, what's with ALL these songs??? Enchanted had, what, three, four songs that were funny and catchy. This movie got a zillion, cliché-sounding songs (except for 'Badder' which was a fun duet, and which should have the only song) turning this into a musical and completely losing the parody aspect and becoming a cliché the first one was making fun of! Having said that, Adams' comedic timing is still spot on. Especially when she switches from sweet Gisele to evil Gisele.",/review/rw8682061/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,gabethedinosaur,10," The perfect thanksgiving movie for the entire family
","Disenchanted was absolutely hilarious and the music was so amazing. Amy adams did a remarkable job, maya Rudolph was even more funnier. The filming was very well done . And the story taking place after the events in New York was a little off edge . But I say it had a good plot of where it was gonna go next . The voice of Elsa from frozen one 2 was brilliant. Her singing was like frozen 2 all mixed together. Doughnut lord from sonic 1 2 was even more funnier . Disenchanted definitely deserves an Oscar next year. Little girls will watch this movie during November December all the way to next year and the year before. Disneyland will probably start adding the characters.",/review/rw8682061/?ref_=tt_urv

","The original 'Enchanted' is a fun melding of Disney Fairytale mixed with modern RomCom, and it works well. It's not the greatest movie ever made, but it has a smile-inducing charm of its own. Amy Adams is superb, and James Marsden steals the show as the classic Prince, whilst Susan Sarandan and Timothy Spall have fun with their roles.",/review/rw8682061/?ref_=tt_urv
