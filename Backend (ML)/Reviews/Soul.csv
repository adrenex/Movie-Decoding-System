18 January 2020,acetaldehid,9," Ignore the reviews from the xenophobes..
",Great storytelling without pushing any agenda. These are real people with real life stories. Nothing more. Nothing less. It's entertaining and not full of cliches as other tv shows like this tend to be..,/review/rw5418316/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2020,jkipkangor,9," Heartwarming
","Was sceptical at first, whether to watch or not ... But I got hooked with just the first episode!
It may not be a favorite for everyone but check out all the episodes to judge this.
Each story summarizes the desires of a human being and what it takes to achieve the height of their personal growth and life.
It is inspiring to say the least.. one long story summarised in half hour isn't easy.",/review/rw5418316/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2020,danhaeg,10," There's nothing else like this
",These stories are so specific (and true!) They also don't reach for easy emotional grabs. Every story is very different but together they share a sense of the hope and suffering that immigrants experience in the US.,/review/rw5418316/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2020,jbrown510,10," A patriotic masterpeice
",It shouldn't seem like a political statement to tell American immigrant stories like these it should and does feel like patriotic statement that the American dream still exists.,/review/rw5418316/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2020,CBirdLyn,9," Every episode is a little movie
",It's very well done. Not every episode might be of one's liking as it is the case with most shows like these with different characters and storylines in each episode. In such a short time I already cared for a lot of the characters.,/review/rw5418316/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2020,gonzojesse,10," All of our stories
","I don't think I've ever seen a show like this before. This is who we are as Americans. This is the story of us. We are presented moments of 8 lives that are more meaningful than I can say. America should always be a beacon of hope, acceptance, and a country of immigrants. That is what we have always been, and that is what has made this country great. Not walls.",/review/rw5418316/?ref_=tt_urv

","A set very positive and heartwarming stories to watch. This is not about acting, this is about people and their stories.",/review/rw5418316/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2020,iamnorton13,10," Beautifully Heartfelt Stories
","With 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and an Audience Rating at 95% this show stands on it's own. It's a collection of beautiful heartwarming stories that combine every emotion! Add on that the show runners tried to get actors and directors from the character's county of origin and it's just a really eye opening experience. This isn't a ""Politically Correct"" thing, it's just a collection of human stories that happen to be about people who moved to America.",/review/rw5418316/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2020,random-70778,," Ignore the 9-10 star reviews, they are all single use accounts, ie SHILLED
","As an immigrant myself I found this series to be the most cliched and unrealistic nonsense on the topic.
If you want to know the timeless story of immigrants watch Kazan's ""America America"" and not this stunningly bad, redundant, trope filled soap opera.",/review/rw5418316/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2020,memoll,10," Ignore the negative reviews!

14 February 2020,ikadery,7," Surprisingly Good
","It's very difficult to showcase such great stories around 30 minutes each, but the filmmakers did a great job.",/review/rw5418316/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2020,benjaminlsgore,10," Amazing!
","This show leaves me speechless every episode. I absolutely love it. It's a wonderful portrayal of the triumph and despair of the human spirit. I can't wait until more episodes are aired. Well done to the directors and those involved in this production. Just fantastic, and everyone really needs to watch this.",/review/rw5418316/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2020,henrycoles9,8," 10/10 if not for the censorship
","This is such a brilliant show and I can't believe Apple caved in to the demands for censoring the last episode by the very countries whose medieval intolerance it shed light on so painfully. Apple TV+ doesn't deserve to be the platform for a groundbreaking show like this. Such a gutless, spineless move. It tears down the whole idea behind the show, the idea of America as an indomitable beacon of freedom.",/review/rw5418316/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2020,henryshear,8," Amazing Stories Filled With Diversity!
","Apple+'s first TV show with real quality in my opinion. Each episode has a very short format of 30 mins, but so much story is told in such a succinct way.",/review/rw5418316/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2020,simone_mitil,10," Uplifting!

21 January 2020,metallicasster,10," Excellent depiction of immigrants and their stores
",I have no clue why the rating are so low for this show. Just completed all the episode and everything from story telling to direction is top notch. A well balanced stories of immigrants in United States. Just heartwarming. A must watch show.,/review/rw5418316/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2022,barbaranamuli,7," The Luganda is off.
","I loved this show until I watched the Ugandan episode, The Baker. If you're to get people who speak a foreign language, please get people who can actually speak the language, not Ugandans who grew up out of Uganda. Or at least get an expert in the language to be part of the production. It makes me think all other episodes are not there either. So disappointed! As a Ugandan, I was just so let down. The rest of the episodes though were amazing.",/review/rw5418316/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2020,stijnvbrummelen,10," A stunning series
","Eight entertaining stories. I always ended the episode with an amazing feeling, as the hard journey from starting with nothing in a new country ending in succes is well documented and nice to see. Fairly well cineography as well. I like how the stories do not really get political.",/review/rw5418316/?ref_=tt_urv
