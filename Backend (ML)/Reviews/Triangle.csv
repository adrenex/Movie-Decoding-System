","Jess (Melissa George) is a single mother struggling to raise her autistic son. While working her job at a diner, she become friends with one of the customers, a playboy type named Greg who invites her on a yachting trip with he and his friends. Desperate for a break from her son, she takes him up on his offer. The day of the trip, she's late getting to the boat and arrives flustered. She says that her son is at school, but it's a Saturday. Despite her questionable frame of mind, Greg introduces her to the group (including uptight sister, Sally, and his first mate, Victor, both of whom are vocal in their reservations about her) and off they go. It's smooth sailing at first, but an out of nowhere storm leaves the boat capsized and the remaining passengers stranded. They think they're in luck when an ocean liner passes by, though boarding the ship is just the beginning of things going from bad to worse.",/review/rw2243278/?ref_=tt_urv

","How to talk about ""Triangle"" without giving anything away? It's a puzzle equal to that which the movie presents its audience, because this isn't your standard horror movie. It has more in common with plot-twisting movies such as ""Momento"" and ""The Machinist"" than the gory likes of ""Halloween"" or ""Ghost Ship"". ",/review/rw2243278/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2016,Sleepin_Dragon,9," A truly great, complex film.
","What an absolute gem of a movie Triangle is, it seemed to go very much under the radar, which was a huge shame, as it really is a clever, intriguing film that crosses several genres, thriller, horror, action etc.",/review/rw2243278/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2009,Lord_Frog,8," Very good and intriguing
","I just came back from the world premiere at FrightFest in London, it was the festival opener as well so expectations were high and it didn't disappoint! Much better than Creep and Severance, this is Christopher Smith's most ambitious film. A mind-bending story that is as puzzling as it is original, Triangle is more a mystery than a horror movie in my opinion. Gorehounds will be sorely disappointed. This is more about a situation which becomes more and more surreal, almost dream-like, I thought during the film that I've had similar nightmares as a kid... nightmares going around in circles and getting more and more frightening because I knew when or how the monster would inevitably come back...",/review/rw2243278/?ref_=tt_urv

25 November 2009,bobby_mak,9," One of the best mysteries lately
","This movie is really amazing. I recommend it a 100%. It plays with your mind from the very beginning until the very end. It just makes you think all the time and even when the credits roll you are left thinking and considering, and I mean that in the good way. Some movies leave you thinking ""Why did that happen? It made no sense whatsoever."". Not this. However, in order to understand everything you must really pay attention to all the details, some lines, some specific shots and then I promise, it will all make sense. Of course, if you have someone to discuss it with after it is over, will make things a lot more interesting and engaging. I just want to say that this movie is not a horror and doesn't have any ""jump"" moments. It is a pure mystery and I am sure that any mystery fan would truly enjoy the experience.",/review/rw2243278/?ref_=tt_urv

","On the grounds that I am going to spoiler this movie totally, I'll start with the summary. It is a psychological suspense / mystery / horror with supernatural and possibly science fiction overtones. Of its sort it isn't bad at all (although there are, for sure, unanswered questions at the end), and I quite enjoyed it.",/review/rw2243278/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2014,Woodyanders,8," Very sly and surprising horror/fantasy thriller
","Troubled Jess (an excellent and convincing performance by Melissa George) and several friends set sail on the open sea on a yacht. Said yacht winds up getting caught in a sudden freak storm in the Bermuda Triangle that wrecks the yacht, thus forcing everyone to board an apparently deserted ocean liner. However, it turns out that there's a masked killer on the ship. Or is there? Writer/director Christopher Smith relates the tricky and engrossing story at a steady pace, takes time to carefully develop the distinctive and believable characters, ably crafts a spooky and unsettling dream-like atmosphere as well as an intriguing aura of perplexing mystery, and builds plenty of nerve-jangling tension. In addition, Smith's script boasts lots of nifty and unexpected twists that ingeniously subvert the basic conventions of your standard supernatural horror shocker by tossing one doozy of a trapped in a constant time loop sci-fi main hook that explores the provocative themes of suppressed guilt and denial with exceptional intelligence and dexterity: The various intricate narrative threads are seamlessly woven into a complex and winding whole which culminates in one hell of a jolting climax that's both poignant and unsettling in equal measure. The uniformly stellar acting by the top-rate casts keeps the movie humming: George clearly dominates the proceedings with her bravura work, with ace support from Michael Dorman as nice guy Greg, Henry Nixon as the jerky Downey, Rachael Carpani as the snippy Sally, Emma Lung as the mousy Heather, and Liam Hemsworth as the hunky Victor. Christian Henson's delicately eerie score further enhances the overall disquieting and disorienting vibe. The sumptuous widescreen cinematography by Robert Humphreys makes the most out of the cramped confines of the claustrophobic primary location. Recommending viewing for those with a taste for more challenging and adventurous out of the ordinary fright fare.",/review/rw2243278/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2019,fahnenjoker,6," Decent attempt at a Loop-Mystery, flawed by holes in its inner logic.
","Triangle is an okay attempt of a time-/purgatory-loop mystery story. It shares a lot of similarities with Time Crimes, but ultimately goes more into the direction of Stay. Camera work and direction are quite good and the cast does an ok job. The effects can be bit cheap at times (the bad CGI of the storm and the approaching Ghost Ship), but that's neglectable.",/review/rw2243278/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2012,Coventry,5," Donnie Darko boards the Death Ship!
","See, I don't like movies that make me feel stupid. Especially not since I know I'm generally not a stupid person. This kind of movie causes people to claim they absolutely loved it, just to prevent others from accusing he/she didn't understand it. I must say I was rather underwhelmed by ""Triangle"" and don't feel too ashamed to admit it, as I've already seen truckload of movies dealing with time-loops, paradoxes and deliberate continuity gaps, and liked most of them a lot better. I'm a fan and admirer of upcoming top-director Christopher Smith, but after barely two promising debut features (""Creep"", ""Severance""), he perhaps overestimated himself already with this needlessly convoluted and (deliberately?) inconclusive mixture of supernatural mystery and cruel slasher picture. Around here as well as on other websites, I've read quite often that ""Triangle"" is most likely inspired by the sleeper hit ""TimeCrimes"". Personally, I truly beg to differ as this genius Spanish movie is pretty much the only existing proof that stories about time lapses and paradoxes don't necessarily have to be complex and confusing. Strange as it may sound, especially when reading the rather bizarre plot synopsis, ""TimeCrimes"" remains logic and easy to follow at all times. That's not exactly what you could say from ""Triangle"". I'd rather compare this movie with the universally worshiped ""Donnie Darko""; and that's definitely a compliment. That particular movie is also compelling and refreshing, but if you ask fifty different people to summarize, you'll receive fifty different versions. Smith introduces an intriguing principal character in the shape of struggling single mother Jess (stellar performance by Melissa George), creates an ideally isolated and naturally mysterious setting with the abandoned ocean liner in the Bermuda Triangle (always a winner!) and stuffs his scenario with obvious and less obvious references to excellent genre classics. For example, and even though not mentioned in the movie references section, the sequence where the shipwrecked posse sees the grisly ocean liner slowly appearing from behind them is (to me, at least) a beautiful and crystal clear homage to the 1980 cult hit ""Death Ship"". Nice attempt and professionally made, but to me the story remains incomplete and only pseudo-intelligent.",/review/rw2243278/?ref_=tt_urv

","If I'm asked which (Mystery) thriller is one of the best I can me name a few - and triangle is certainly one of them. The way the story is told is simply amazing! Loads of symbolism, details not to be missed and references to Greek mythology. An unique, psychological twisted and still cohesive story unfolds step by step... only to end where all starts. Superior to other wannabe mystery / thriller / horror as it actually dares to go a different route.",/review/rw2243278/?ref_=tt_urv

2 May 2010,Scarecrow-88,7," Triangle
","Triangle is one of those movies where a lead character tries to avert a series of events and, despite all his/her efforts, just contributes to the cycle instead of prevent the inevitable. That's as far as I will go in describing the plot's conundrum for a haunted Melissa George who portrays the mother of an autistic boy, joining a group on an ocean voyage aboard a friend's yacht. They encounter an ominous electrical storm which eventually causes a serious catastrophe toppling the boat and sending the crew overboard. Those that survive this discover an old ship, board it, and find themselves hunted by someone in a mask, trying to kill them with a shot gun. Melissa George is the central focus of a strange scenario where she learns of the identity behind the one wearing the mask and tries various methods to help the others, unable to stop the pattern that seems to continue regardless of whatever she tries. The director/writer Christopher Smith takes the classic Dead of Night(a story that has been the model for plenty of shows and movies who have used it to pit an unfortunate soul in a nightmarish prison never to escape)and updated it with Melissa George in the role of Mervyn Johns. Sure the setting and circumstances are different, but the lead suffers deja vu and is trapped in a fate worse than death, trying to put together how she remembers the ship they board, and why her association with the surroundings is so familiar. I think the greatest asset for Triangle is how George's character is shown in different ways as the film continues..we think we know her then the ending shows us a side of George that causes us to reflect on the killer aboard the Aeolus and how nothing is what it seems. Again, the way Smith unveils the story certainly gripped me, although having seen this kind of story used previously, it didn't necessarily surprise me because Dead of Night used this all the way back in 1945, but I admire the clever way he put this all together. And, I love following around Melissa George for 90 minutes, as she goes through a roller coaster of different emotions, provided with a character and storyline that allows her to prove how underrated an actress she is.",/review/rw2243278/?ref_=tt_urv

13 December 2019,christopher-underwood,7," She looks great despite having only the one t-shirt and shorts throughout
","I preferred the beginning and end of this to the rather protracted and repetitive main body. The opening credits have real style and prompt thought of David Lynch as we espy from unusual angles the likes of a revolving garden sprinkler, a lazily pushed lawnmower, an unclean pond and a washing line. At the same time the enigmatic ending promises to make sense of what we have seen with a mix of rescue and disaster on the street. In between a rather protracted tale is told upon some ghost ship where shipwreck survivors come and go and come again. Its not terrible but I wouldn't want to watch it again, except for the fact that leading actress Melissa George works her socks off almost single-handed in an attempt to keep this afloat. She looks great despite having only the one t-shirt and shorts throughout and it is a shame she gets little support from the others.",/review/rw2243278/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2020,alexkzapf,8," The key to understanding this movie.
",The most important part to understanding this movie happens when they look at the painting of the ship they are on. It talks about not keeping a promise to death. And this becomes obvious with the ending. The cab driver. Death in person. It is a good mystery movie which will have you guessing and wondering. I loved it. Not sure about all the negative reviews. It may take more than one watch to understand the movie.,/review/rw2243278/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2010,ptb-8,8," Not The Last Of Sheilas
","TRIANGLE for me is a terrific time loop scifi horror set aboard a marauding art deco luxury liner. And as much as I detest Friday 13TH and its kind I found TRIANGLE to be a compelling and shocking and utterly mesmerizing experience. The whole idea of the time-shifting and the unbreakable cycle and how the events layer upon each other, different angles of witness, assisting the friends who are doomed anyway, the scary deserted luxury liner, and the horror of her treatment of her son...all add up to a very clever and ingenious Australian made thriller. If you combine GROUNDHOG DAY with GHOST SHIP you will get an idea of the construct. TRIANGLE has a terrific CGI storm, some creepy Oceanliner imagery and delivers some real jump shocks. I am amazed at the bad reviews and am very disappointed if this film does not reach its audience. BUT here in Sydney it is released on one screen with the most stupid advertising imaginable: an axe murderer stalking Melissa George. Wow if a film's marketing imagery could be more off putting I have yet to see it this side of HOSTEL 2 and any Friday THIRTEENTH junk which TRIANGLE certainly is not. Fortunately I took a chance suspecting TRIANGLE might just be better than its ad sell and I was right. Go see TRIANGLE and ignore the bad reviews and the stupid ads and posters.",/review/rw2243278/?ref_=tt_urv
