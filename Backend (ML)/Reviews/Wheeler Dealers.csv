19 November 2015,ferguson-6,5," Choose Argentina
","Greetings again from the darkness. Why, Billy Ray, why? It's not surprising that Hollywood green-lighted the Americanization of the 2010 Oscar winner for Best Foreign Language film, El secreto de sus ojos. That original from Argentina is exemplary filmmaking and a thoroughly entertaining and compelling mystery-thriller; a must-see for any true film lover. Even if an Oscar-studded cast is hired (2 Oscar winners, 8 nominations), the guiding inspiration for a remake should be more than losing the subtitles and filming Julia Roberts without make-up.",/review/rw6443200/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,5," So disappointing.
","When I saw the cast list, which includes Julia Roberts, Nicole Kidman and the brilliant Chiwetel Ejiofor I thought I was in for ninety minutes of sheer quality, you can forgive me for thinking that, when you take into account the number of awards shared by the stars, the budget, and the pedigree of the original movie. Unfortunately, Hollywood strikes again, the curse of the poor remake, it was virtually impossible to mess this up, but mess up they did. The acting was fine, strong production values, a clever story, in theory. However, the execution is so bad, the film lacks any degree of suspense, it lacks any degree of subtlety needed to tell such a story, and the characters are such that I didn't care less what happened to any of them, as I have no connection with anybody. The film should have been gripping, exciting, at least moved you to empathise with the characters, but no, it was utterly bland, such a waste of so much talent. I'm stunned by some of the positive reviews I've read, what are they seeing that I couldn't, all I did was yawn, and I'm easy to please in terms of thrillers.",/review/rw6443200/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2019,claudio_carvalho,7," Dark Remake
","""Secret in Their Eyes"" is a dark remake of the excellent Oscar winner ""El secreto de sus ojos"" (2009). The story of the Argentinian-Spanish film is magnificent and the cast of ""Secret in Their Eyes"" is top-notch. Despite the confused screenplay, the result is a film not comparable to the original but worthwhile watching. My vote is seven.",/review/rw6443200/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2015,Giacomo_De_Bello,5," 5/10
","If you haven't seen ""El Segreto de sus ojos"" I beg you to stop reading and go check it out, it is, in my opinion, one of those rare and pure thrillers that keeps you glued to the screen for two hours. Yet, despite loving the original, I wasn't going into this one ready to bitch about it. I am someone who is very sniffy about remakes, but hey if you have an fascinating premise that can be explored through various styles and dynamics I am all for it. Especially in this case, I think that keeping some of the core material and turning other parts completely around could have made for a fascinating narrative, unfortunately the American remake, with the exception of maybe two or three ides, doesn't improve, explore or further the original in anyway and sometimes even edges the shot-by-shot remake treatment.",/review/rw6443200/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2016,MattyGibbs,8," Love the original and love the the remake
","This is a rare beast a remake that is actually pretty good. Although it it isn't as good as the original, lacking the slow burn nature of it, it's still a well made and entertaining film. ",/review/rw6443200/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2017,redproton88,8," Ignore the bad reviews comparing this to the original
","This film is far better than than 6.2 rating it has received which seems mostly to come from those wanting to compare it to the Argentinian original. I am rating this as a separate film and not comparing it to the original. The acting is top notch and believable. Ejiofor, Kidman and Roberts all do a great job. ",/review/rw6443200/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2021,Orhan_Akdeniz,5," I recommend the original

22 October 2016,krocheav,," The Secret Should Have Been This Film
","From just after the opening this effort began to look like Television with pretensions. Maybe it's time Hollywood and audiences got over the misguided following of styles from the likes of Tarantino and Scorsese - both who seem to have joined other overrated movie makers of the era...Now Billy Ray joins their club with this over-everything mess of a movie. More ridiculous flash-back, flash-forward techniques to leave the viewer simply wanting to give up. It even looks like the movie makers were confused and perhaps forgot to change some of the wardrobe between some time-skip scenes. Why further complicate an already overly complex screenplay??",/review/rw6443200/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2016,davispittman,7," Pretty well made film
","Secret in their eyes (2015) is a pretty well made film, it's definitely well acted, great performances by all the cast including: Julie Roberts, Chiwetel, and Nicole Kidman, they all have very real powerful performances. The script is pretty good, not the best ever, but it works. The characters are well written too. The tense scenes and situations throughout really made this film, the mystery of not knowing certain things really keeps you interested too. I can without a doubt say that the actors performances were my favorite part of this film, they were just so amazing here! And the ending was my other favorite part, the ending is very clever and unexpected, or at least I didn't see it coming, which is awesome, because anyone who knows me knows how much I love a good surprise ending to a film. 7/10 for Secrets in their eyes.",/review/rw6443200/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2019,asage19,5," Menh...
","I haven't seen the original Argentinian film, but I do have a thought... I don't know if it's due to how this version was made or what. My notion is that the idea, the concept of the story is probably uniquely 'other' in flavour, in comparison to North American tastes.
OTOH, I have read a lot of good, articulate reviews of this version here, and so I wonder if this film could have been made better, if it had been made in a tighter, more North American fashion.
For me, the problem is that I just don't care enough about any of the main characters. The DA Morales is interesting, 'Bumpy' is interesting, in fact all of the characters apart from the main three characters are interesting. It just makes me so sad that the actors of the main roles were stuck in a different movie than the secondary characters ;>
Another way I looked at it is that it seems to me that the action in the movie isn't centred around the main characters, it's around the secondary characters. The three main characters are stuck in a slow-as-molasses dreamworld that just isn't all that interesting. I get that it's a psychological thriller, not an action/mystery/thriller film. I just wish that it could have been more compelling and more interesting. By the end of the movie, I felt kinda cheated, just didn't care about the twist, kinda shrugging my shoulders just as the main characters do, in the end. Who cares?",/review/rw6443200/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2015,benmichael-6333,1," Hollywood, go to your room.
","Hollywood, we spoke about this just last week. I know you're young and I know that sometimes means you want to steal ideas from others and think that by changing language and adding ""stars"" you will make something better but you know it doesn't work. We talked about 9 Quenns just the other day but now you've done it again. A poetic, heartbreaking, beautifully acted, thriller from Argintinia gets turned into barely watchable mush. So, go to you room, no dinner and don't do it again. And once you have realised the error of your ways we will watch the original and realise that having to read and watch a film isn't the end of the world and even better, opens you up to the idea that the action, the great stories, the films that treat the viewer as an adult, generally, don't come out of Hollywood anymore. Argintinia alone has been steadily putting out gem after gem, maybe we will have a mini fest on that country's output and forget bad remakes for a while.",/review/rw6443200/?ref_=tt_urv

","I kept trying to find reviews of this movie and all I could find were those saying how great the original was and how this movie was not the same. I watch foreign films, I lived in Spain. I don't expect a film made in the USA to be the same as one made elsewhere. That is not what I am looking for in a review.",/review/rw6443200/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2015,girvanpaterson,7," Quite a Good Secret
","Having read all the negative and Luke warm reviews, it was with some trepidation that I we went to see this film, now I haven't seen the Argentine original, but I did enjoy this one! Kept my interest the whole time, all the leads were strong and believable, never a big Julia Roberts fan, she was outstanding in this, I certainly don't agree with the reviewers that said Nicole Kidman was miscast, I thought she was excellent, you don't get to be an A grade Academy Award winner by being a bad actress! Perhaps it's not as good as the original are they ever? But it stands on it's own, and would be in my top ten for this year ,not that it has a lot to beat? Far as I could tell, everyone in the theater enjoyed it! Hey! It's a movie, not brain surgery!",/review/rw6443200/?ref_=tt_urv

","The biggest Mystery in this Movie is how an A-Lister, a Remake of an Oscar Winning Film (Best Foreign Film 2009), with two Oscar Winning Actresses on board (Nicole Kidman, Julia Roberts), a Director, Oscar Nominee Billy Ray, and an intense Leading Man (Chiwetel Ejiofor) also an Oscar Nominee, can produce such a Dull Movie.

9 February 2016,christopher-dallas-113-229541,4," Please watch the Argentine/Spanish original
","The original, ""El secreto de sus ojos"" is a masterpiece of cinema and story. Not just the premise but you get to see the justice system of Argentina and Spain. It's pretty interesting since we are saturated with the American justice system.Very much unlike the US and similar to France (Engrenages is a great French police procedural TV series). People either cannot or will not watch foreign cinema or have difficulty with subtitles. I understand that it is a challenge in that your eyes are diverted from the screen, the cultures are unfamiliar or the intonation can be confusing. Cinema and literature is escapism. Step outside of the box. I'm hearing impaired and use subs for all TV programs. I acknowledge that it's easier for me. Hollywood ruins spectacular foreign films. If American audiences want to see less engaging movies, there are films for that. And that's fine. We call them ""guilty pleasures"" or ""no brainers.""",/review/rw6443200/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2017,kosmasp,4," Waste of time
","The original was so good. I mean really good and I'm happy I already knew it, because this remake would have ruined it all. Underwhelming would be an understatement. It really takes a good concept tries to run with it, but never really touches the viewer or gets you to the edge of your seat. Well maybe once or twice, but even then the moments were much bigger in the original.",/review/rw6443200/?ref_=tt_urv

","The story takes place switching back and forth between two time periods. In 2002, Ray Kasten (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Jessica Cobb (Julia Roberts) are investigators in L.A. Claire Sloane (Nicole Kidman) is the new lawyer in the D.A.'s office. D.A. Martin Morales (Alfred Molina) is obsessed with uncovering a plot in a mosque under investigation. Jessica's murdered daughter Carolyn is found near the mosque. Ray quickly zeroes in on car thief Marzin who turns out to be the confidential informer inside the mosque. Ray finds Morales blocking his effort. Thirty years after the case somehow got buried, Ray returns claiming to have found Marzin by visually checking each inmate and that Marzin has just recently let out of prison.

","Hollywood has done it again! They have taken a successful and well made foreign film and produced a second rate theatrical release that has failed to create an impact that would be considered worthy of being mentioned in the same breathe as the original. The only thing that has saved Director Billy Ray's remake is the wealth of talent that he has been able to bring along for the ride.

","The only sensible reason to watch this pathetic disaster is for the students of cinema, cinematography and everything related, and analysts (professional and amateurs) as a study. It is not first neither last time Hollywood butchered great script and created mockery of art. ""Abre los ojos"" and ""Vanilla sky"", ""Solaris"" (though if you never seen the Tarkowsky's original it may appear as not so bad) now the Campanella masterpiece. I can see his name in the credits, wow, is his financial situation so bad ? Was Juan Jose really part of this remake ? If so than this is sad indeed. There is no tension, no suspense and sorry to say it made me realise even more how outstanding was Soledad Villamil and Ricardo Darin. Shame that the non Spanish speaking world may never enjoy their outstanding films. Darin is probably one of the greatest actors of our times. What they created in the original film was amazing. ""El secreto de sus ojos"" was a revelation to me, watched it several times and after that all the films of Juan Jose Campanella and of Ricardo Darin, that film opened to me the fascinating world of Argentinian cinema. This thing, reminds me of old recipe from the pop music world ""simplify then exaggerate"". Another Hollywood fail",/review/rw6443200/?ref_=tt_urv
