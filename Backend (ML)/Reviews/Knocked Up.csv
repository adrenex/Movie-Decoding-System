14 August 2001,Smells_Like_Cheese,9," A fantastic update about the rules of seduction
","Cruel Intentions was my favorite movie when I was 14, to me it was everything I just wanted to be as a teen, despite how cruel and manipulative Katheryn was, I thought she was the coolest and strongest female character I'd ever seen on film. Now a couple years afterwards I read the book and saw the original Dangerous Liasons with John Malkovich and Glenn Close, I still very much enjoy Cruel Intentions. Like I said, this was just a terrific updated version of the ultimate story of love and betrayal, it was a little Dawson's Creek at times, but from what angle they went at, it was understandable. It had the biggest stars: Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillipe, Reese Withersppon, Tara Reid, Joshua Jackson, and Selma Blair. May I say they gave extremely impressive performances, but the best without a doubt goes to Sarah Michelle Gellar, she was just ultimately brilliant as Kathryn Muertiel, the cruelist girl in school who's goal isn't to be the most popular, but to dominate everyone's innocence.",/review/rw7266388/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2002,Old Joe,," They're old enough to know better and too young to care!
","I have recently been seeing a psychiatrist about a few troubles. In one of his sessions, he bought up about the movie Cruel Intentions, which I absolutely loved. He said he loved the start of the movie where the evil Sebastian says to the Psychologist `You have beautiful legs, I would love to photograph them'. This then sets the tone for one of the best teen films that the world has seen. Based on the movie Dangerous Liaisons, Cruel Intentions goes down as one of my top five favourite films of all-time.",/review/rw7266388/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 1999,Buddy-51,," strong beginning, weak ending
","For exactly two-thirds of its 97 minute running time, ""Cruel Intentions"" scores as a nasty-minded, wryly satiric and even mildly courageous teen update of ""Dangerous Liaisons.""  But, like so many movies with one eye cocked towards the boxoffice, ""Cruel Intentions"" loses its nerve and settles ultimately for comfortable, safe and hopelessly dull conventionality. Ryan Phillippe and Sarah Michelle Gellar portray a wicked pair of step siblings who operate together to prey sexually upon unsuspecting victims, manipulating others to achieve their goals of personal conquest and revenge. It's refreshing to encounter protagonists who make no excuses for their amorality and instead allow themselves to be completely guided by their own self-serving impulses, totally unmindful of the consequences to others. Their schemes are acted out with a callous gleefulness and self-absorbed relish that raises the film to a level of surprisingly sophisticated satire and audacity.  But, when Sebastian encounters his ultimate challenge - a midwestern virgin played by Reese Witherspoon, who has publicly declared in a magazine her decision to wait for true love before offering herself to a man - he falls under her charms and suddenly transforms from coldhearted predator to mushheaded romantic.  This is the major problem with the film. Sebastian is valid and interesting as a character as long as he stays within the realm of sly manipulator and acerbic scoundrel.  When he is called upon to function as a dashing romantic figure, he loses both credibility and uniqueness - and the film itself goes into a freefall tailspin.  For, as Sebastian undergoes his sudden conversion, all the sharply satiric wit simply drains out of the film.  We're ultimately left with little more than unconvincing melodrama, inappropriately tragic overtures and a silly evildoers-do-not-prosper resolution.  What a pity to see yet another in a long line of movies that start out with bright promise, but which finally end up renaging on their initial courageousness, leaving the audience in perpetual frustration.",/review/rw7266388/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2010,imdbbl,," Clever, witty and very sensual
","In this film wealthy prep school student Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar) bets her stepbrother Sebastian (Ryan Phillipe) that he can't deflower the virginal Annette (Reese Witherspoon) before the school year begins. If he fails to accomplish this task, Kathryn gets his Jaguar Roadster; if he succeeds, he gets an evening of pleasure with Kathryn. ",/review/rw7266388/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2011,Sandcooler,7," Not as mature as ""Dangerous Liaisons"", but that's sorta its charm
","I find it incredibly peculiar how the same novel (Choderlos de Laclos' ""Les liaisons dangereuses"", but that won't be on the test) can spawn two separate interpretations that are absolutely nothing alike. ""Dangerous Liaisons"" was a very stylish, classy, hyper-professional and (maybe as a result) also somewhat slow costume drama, while ""Cruel Intentions"" shamelessly takes the sleazy road and ends up being really entertaining. It's primarily aimed at teens and piles up Hollywood clichés like it's a contest or something, but despite those hurdles it manages to strike exactly the right dark tone. Sarah Michelle Gellar is really good in the Glenn Close role, technically she only gives her villain one dimension but it's a dimension you love to hate. She has acid running through her veins, in fact the whole movie seems a lot more harsh and direct than ""Dangerous Liaisons"" was. Do I actually prefer this high schooler remake over the original ""Dangerous Liaisons""? Well, secretly yes, but to avoid being burned on a pyre I'll just say they're both excellent movies in their own right. ""Cruel Intentions"" is just a great watch though.",/review/rw7266388/?ref_=tt_urv

",Cruel Intentions came at the right time when it was released in March of 99. After sitting through lite teen fare such as She's All That it was a welcome change to see a teen film take a chance and be a little darker. This dark comedy was a pleasant surprise to me because not only does it qualify as a guilty pleasure; it is actually a good film as well.,/review/rw7266388/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2006,JamesHitchcock,6," Lacks the Courage of its Lack of Convictions
","Once upon a time there were three young actresses named Sarah Michelle, Selma and Laura Jean, who for reasons best known to herself preferred to be called Reese. They acted together in a film called ""Cruel Intentions"", after which fate had different things in store for our three friends. Sarah Michelle went on to star in the two ""Scooby-Doo"" films which achieved the difficult feat of making even the original cartoon series look intelligent by comparison. Selma may one day become the greatest Lady Macbeth of the twenty-first century, but even if she does she will have difficulty living down the ""I can't believe I'm making love to a big purple elephant"" scene from the awesomely tasteless ""The Sweetest Thing"". (Yes, I know she didn't say ""making love"" but decency forbids a verbatim quotation). And Reese? Reese went on to give a cracking performance in one of the best films of 2005 and won a well-deserved Oscar. It just goes to show you never can tell.",/review/rw7266388/?ref_=tt_urv

","Cruel Intentions is the perfect romantic drama. This fruit did not fall far from the Romeo & Juliet tree. Romance, love, plots, and drama are all turned modern and splendidly rendered.

21 November 2005,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,10," Excellent teen flick which will have you feeling good from start to finish
","CRUEL INTENTIONS, in my opinion, is an excellent teen flick which will have you feeling good from start to finish. When Dr. Greenbaum (Swoosie Kurtz) pounded on her office window and yelled at Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe) after Marci (Tara Reid) called her in tears, I really felt good. To me, the performances were top grade, the direction was flawless, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the set was nice. Also, the scenes with Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar) were excellent, too. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent teen flick which will have you feeling good from start to finish to any Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, or Reese Witherspoon fan who hasn't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",/review/rw7266388/?ref_=tt_urv

It's fun, entertaining, and just so devilish that you are sucked right into it. it's like a guilty pleasure. The best thing about this film is that it's a break from the happy giddy teen films that have invaded theaters. it's a clever dark comedy that deserves some recognition.",/review/rw7266388/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2004,la-36,10," Sexy
","This movie gives a sexy, sensual twist to the stereotypical ""teen flick."" It communicates a new idea of sexuality amongst present-day teenagers, rather than the ""bang her and leave her"" mentality that is most commonly portrayed. I think the cast was very well chosen, and the dynamics of the cast were amazing. There weren't too many ""no names"" or ""B list"" actors, but on the other hand there weren't too many ""A listers,"" which would have thrown the focus off the plot. The music used in the movie was perfect because it accentuated the tone of the movie. ",/review/rw7266388/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have recently seen the movie ""Cruel Intentions,"" and let me say it is one of the best films I've seen in a long while. As a big movie buff, I always see the latest movies on opening night, but I got a chance to see this one months before it will be released. Sarah Michelle Gellar is a stunning actress, and portrays Kathryn extremely well. Her character is evil and cunning, and is delivered with such grace and perfection... Ryan Phillippe is excellent as well, and he portrays Sebastian Valmont with as much talent as the lovely Ms. Gellar. They work very well together, as they did in their last movie together, ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER""",/review/rw7266388/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2017,ironhorse_iv,6," I won't be, too cruel on this movie, too much. It was just meh. There is nothing worth getting too work up, about.
","There's a lesbian kiss between Sarah Michelle Gellar & Selma Blair's characters & sadly, that's what most people remember about this movie. Nevertheless, this film directed by Roger Kumble, originally named 'Cruel Inventions' before getting renamed, in order, to sound, less sci-fiction, has more to give, than just that. While, I wouldn't say, this American teenager film version is the best adaptation of author, Pierre Choderios de Laclo's 1782's novel, 'Les Liaisons dangereuses'; because it's not. I can say, the film about two teenager socialite step-siblings, Kathryn Merteuil (Sarah Michelle Gellar) & Sebastian Valmont (Ryan Phillippe), using seduction as a weapon to socially control and exploit others like Cecile Caldwell (Selma Blair) & Annette Hargrove (Reese Witherspoon), all the while enjoying their cruel games and boasting about their manipulative talents, was not that bad. It was mediocre, at best. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this movie didn't have the same success and impact, as 1988's 'Dangerous Liaisons', had; maybe, because writer, Roger Kumble use a modern teenager settling, with little to no stalks, attached to it, rather than, setting the movie, with older crowd in a more compelling and complex location, like Wall Street, Hollywood, or better yet, in order, to fit more, with the French-like libertinism themes of the novel, post Antebellum, New Orleans College Life. Another reason, why the original settling works so well, is because, that novel depict 'Ancien Régime' French aristocracy, so cruel & corrupt, that it justified, the reasons, why the French Revolution, was needed. Here, the film does not, expose the dark side of capitalism & materialism that much, to justified, any reform, nor does it, make, the characters, too unlikable to hate. Toward the middle of the movie, the tone of the piece, switch, from, exposing the perversions of upper society to romantic teen drama, about Sebastian, slowly, falling in love, with one of his victim, Annette. Sebastian is presented far more sympathetically than his counterpart in the original novel and its adaptations. Because of this, the tone of this bet, makes the film, seem like it belong in the same typical cheesy teen-pop vain as films like 1999's ""She's All that', than the cruel actions of 1959's 'Les liaisons dangereuses'. It's sad, because, this movie could had been something, so much, more, than kinda bland. Although, the film documents themes like incest, homosexuality, and miscegenation, it plays those subjects, pretty safe for a Rated R movie. Also, hardly any graphic nudity. This film, wasn't as risky as the original with its shining example of debauchery and decadence. After all, Valmont in the novel, does rape, and cause a lot of people to commit suicide, a lot more seriously. Sebastian in the film, is far from being, true-evil. Another big change from the novel, is the ending. Instead, of a justified duel to the death for a character that deserve it, the film, ends, bittersweet, with the lover, saving his love's life from accident. This ending, doesn't have the same impact as the original, because we know, that the character could perform an unselfish deed, while the reader of the novel has no way of knowing the protagonist true feelings. Did Valmont change for the good!? The book leave that, open-ended. I felt, the closure of 'Cruel Intentions', left, not enough work, for being thought-provoking. Another interesting observation that can be concluded after analyzing the film is the raw language is not as sophisticated as the book. I found the dialogue of the film, to be, shallow and not very memorable. Yet, another problem, with this film is overall, acting. While, Ryan Phillippe, was alright in the role, he was given. Some parts of his performance seem a little too annoying, whinny for my taste. The acting from Sarah Michelle Gellar was a little worst, with her going a little, too cartoony, over the top with being a vileness. Both young performers, couldn't touch, the sublime narcissistic egotism that, Glenn Close & John Malkovich pull off, in the 1988's film. Despite that, I have to say, the supporting cast was a lot better. While, Selma Blair's character, was made into a clueless ditz. She did play the role, well. The same with Reese Witherspoon. She really did, seem like she was the angelic virgin, despite, stealing a vintage car in the end. As for the adult performers, in this film. There were very unremarkable. I totally forgot that actress, Christine Baranski & Louise Fletcher, were in this film. That's how much, they didn't shine. Despite that, I do have to say, the movie was beautiful shot. The escalator scene, toward the end, was very noticeable. Another great thing, about this film, is the beautiful, well-crafted soundtrack. This movie had some of the best musicians of the '90s: 'Placebo, Aimee Mann, Skunk Anansie, Blur, and The Verve' to name, a few. It was nice to listen to. As for the sequels/prequels like 2000's 'Cruel Intentions 2' & 2004's 'Cruel Intentions 3'. They weren't worth checking out. However, the 2016 TV Movie/pilot of television series of the same name, might be worth seeing, if the footage is ever released. Overall: Despite its many flaws, this movie is still worth checking. 'Cruel Intentions' was somewhat seduced at the time.",/review/rw7266388/?ref_=tt_urv

","Seeing this movie, I was extremely disappointed. It pretends to be this remake of ""Dangerous Liaisons"", but it introduces something that ruins it, extremely complex adult themes in the bodies of people who are not complex, nor adults. At one point Sebastian actually says... ""I tire of sleeping with these Pedantic Manhattan debutantes"" Yeah, I remember saying similar things at 17.

Maybe I'm too unbiased, but I don't see any real flaws in this movie, and rewatching it made me realize how great the acting was. Sarah Michelle Gellar was at the top of her game. Her co-stars were as well, of course. But she really gave her all to the Katherine Merteuil part. Sadly, it wasn't as popular as other old classics re-reading like Romeo & Juliette, but it sure left its mark and I'm glad to see so many people still enjoy it after all these years. And how all of the themes (that remain unchanged to this day) were handled without forcing anything, like they do today. One word of advice, ignore the sequels...",/review/rw7266388/?ref_=tt_urv
