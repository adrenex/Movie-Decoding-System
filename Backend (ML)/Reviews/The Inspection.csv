16 September 2022,A_Different_Drummer,7," Some context may be welcome
","Back when dinosaurs roamed (before the internet), every drug store and pharmacy on the planet offered patrons rows and rows of things called ""pocketbooks"" which people used to ""read"" (before streaming media and DVDs). In that specific setting, several bestselling authors stood out because of the multiple books featuring their name. One of those standout authors was Gregory MacDonald (no longer with us) and his fictional character was named Fletch. People loved Fletch not only because he was a cool (often unwilling) detective, but because the style of writing was incredibly concise and different. Short sentences. Things happened quickly. Dialog was briief. Narrative deboned with the fat removed. You get the picture. When the first series of Fletch films was made in 1985, Hollywood cast SNL icon Chevy Chase. He was good in the role. Hell, he was awesome. So here we are in the 2020s when, it seems, everything is being remade except your Aunt Bessie's peach cobbler. (And they are working on that.) Older viewers will inevitably compare Hamm to Chase, and possibly find fault. Younger viewers will be OK with this less edgy, more laid back version of Fletch. But then again they really have nothing to compare him to. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

18 September 2022,DarkVulcan29,8," There's a new Fletch in town.
","I was uncertain about Jon Hamm taking over the role made famous by Chevy Chase, not sure he could pull off the funny sarcastic charm the way Chase pulled it off. But after seeing the movie I gotta say Hamm really knocked it out the park, now he is no Chevy Chase, but does play the part in his own funny way.",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,5," This felt more like a made for TV Lifetime or Hallmark murder mystery.
","After the first 15 mins, I lost interest and started getting really impatient and bored. It felt like my wife was forcing me to sit through one of those cheesy Aurora Teagarden mysteries - only this was more inept and boring. It was poorly written and directed, and way too long and dragged out within its convoluted narrative to maintain any interest in the slowly paced albeit normally comfortable 98 min runtime. The humor was stale and not funny at all, the dialogue mostly cheesy and cringeworthy, and even the casting and performances felt called in. Maybe if this had been cut down to a one hour TV-show length run time, I may have enjoyed it. But this was just too bland and messy to sit through the entire runtime. As is says in the film's trailer, There's only one Fletch, and this isn't it.",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,IonicBreezeMachine,7," Confess, Fletch features a solid performance by Jon Hamm as the titular comic sleuth and maintains the character's core appeal.
","Freelance reporter Irwin ""Fletch"" Fletcher (Jon Hamm) is in Boston investigating stolen artwork for his friend Angela (Lorena Izzo) the daughter of an Italian count who's been kidnapped with the kidnappers demanding the artworks as ransom. Upon his arrival in Boston, Fletch discovers his townhouse rented on his behalf has been the site of a murder which detectives Monroe (Roy Wood Jr.) and Griz (Ayden Mayeri) are all too eager to believe Fletch is the perp despite him calling the police in the first place. Unphased by the possibility of taking the fall for a frame-up, Fletch travels around Boston interacting with various quirky characters and using his unconventional investigative skills to find the artwork and the true killer.",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,BongoJustice,," The odd chuckle but ultimately disappointing
",I'm a huge fan of Fletch and also of Jon Hamm but this movie doesn't really work. The writers have made a grave error by making most of the supporting cast quirky weirdoes with funny dialogue but this is the wrong way round - the reason the first two movies worked is that FLETCH is that guy and most everyone else is the straight man.,/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,genious-35413,7," I Loathe Sequels/Prequels/Spinoffs/Reduxes/Reimaginings/Remakes
","I was dead set against seeing this - not because I hold the original in such high regard. I'm indifferent to it. It was fine at the time but re-watching it a couple of years ago, it just didn't hold up for me. And with all of the great movies to re-watch over and over again (Goodfellas, Heat, anything Tarantino), why would I bother watching this? Well, to begin with: Greg Mottola. And then the cast. And I have to say, this movie didn't disappoint - as cynical as I was. It kept the spirit of Fletch, and the book, but exceeded what I thought I'd get. It's not at all a throwaway comedy - I will probably rewatch this again sooner rather than later. I could yammer on even more but what's the point - it was a good movie and worth watching. So just watch it.",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,ben-mckimm,7," Good fun
","I really enjoyed this. I've seen the first 2 movies and was prepared for a Chevy Chase replication, but not as good. Jon Hamm somehow managed to keep the character familiar but also completely make it his own. I'm not a huge fan of the original (seen them a couple of times and and liked them but have no strong emotions for them) so I had few expectations but it's clever, it's funny, it doesn't outstays it's welcome and it doesn't try too hard.",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2022,imseeg,4," Not even a bit funny. Not mysterious. Not suspenseful. Nada. Nothing.
","There are comedies and WANNABE comedies. This is (you guessed it!) a wannabe comedy, which simply faills to become even a bit funny.",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,paul_haakonsen,5," Don't expect a Chevy Chase comedy here...
","When I sat down to watch the 2022 movie ""Confess, Fletch"", I must admit that I was expecting it to be a follow-up to the 1985 ""Fletch"" and the 1989 ""Fletch Lives"" movies. However, as I perused the Trivia section here on IMDb, I figured out that the movie was not that, but instead about the investigator reporter based on the books by Gregory McDonald. Sure, I was a little bit disappointed about that, plus also disappointed that I wouldn't get to see Chevy Chase return to the role.",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,sumtim3s00n,6," Hamm Is Great But It Feels Like First 30mins Of Movie are Missing
","Overall I quite like the film, Hamm is charismatic and each character has their own recognition and own their role very well. There are fun banters and lots of chamistry between characters to go around.",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,yooniverse,8," Hamm pulls it off
","I really didn't think Jon Hamm could pull off the role, but does a more than serviceable job here. He captures the spirit of Fletch, although the story doesn't seem to rely on the use the various silly disguises, fast talking, and funny aliases that the original used. Nevertheless, there's enough there to make you believe he's the same Fletch. I sort of liked the fact that Hamm didn't try too hard to make the character his own.",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2022,subxerogravity,7," Not bad at all.
","So, I'm somewhat familiar with the Fletch movies from the 80s starring Chevy Chase, which I saw before discovering the movies are based on a series of books and OfCourse like most book adaptions, those movies are not true to the source material (what a shocker)",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2023,FeastMode,5," A mostly solid throw-away streaming movie
","Confess, Fletch is a mildly enjoyable mystery-comedy. I didn't laugh out loud at all, but I found it to be fairly amusing throughout the runtime. Most of the jokes made me smirk. That normally wouldn't be enough for a comedy movie, but the story and mystery are serviceable enough to keep me intrigued and invested.",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2022,keikoyoshikawa,3," Face Palm, Fletch
","I like Jon Hamm as an actor. But I do not like Jon Hamm as Fletch. Honestly, it looks like he's bored for most of the movie and was just phoning it in.",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2022,chris-h-3,2," Bland film with flat direction and lead
","You get the impression from very the first scene that the dialogue is supposed to zing back and forth, but there is no rhythm to the scene or the performances and it all just falls flat.",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2022,lenwenzellw,3," The gags were trite, old, and sadly lacking any spark of humour or originality.
","While watching the film I was thinking to myself that non of the humour was working. The gags were trite, old, and sadly lacking any spark of humour or originality. The only original bit was Fletch's compulsive baring of his feet, and obnoxiously inflicting said feet at the drop of a shoe. The plot was boring, and the villain came off as slightly repulsive, without even a hint of menace. Only due to wanting to see the entire film to review it was I able to stay in my seat while being thoroughly UN-entertained. Otherwise, I would have walked out, and asked for a refund. Save your money, and watch Chevy Chase's take on the Fletch character for an original, and weirdly funny film with lots of classic slapstick.",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,martinrobertson300482,4," Disappointing
","I (like most people) am a bit tired of all the remakes and reboots and everything. But fletch apparently has a bunch of untouched books following the character, and the 2 Chevy Chase 80's movies aren't as untouchable as some of the redos we've already had. So I wasn't entirely against this new version.",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2022,karinahatem,4," Fletch the silly boring
","Goodness me, this is an insult to Chevy Chase's movies. The movie was silly and boring, with very poor performance from everyone. Jon Hamm, besides not being funny, he was also annoying as well, and so did rest of the characters. He did a terrible job playing this role.. As the movie itself, story no original, and it was so predictable. If they are planning mother movie, they better get another funny actor, get a better writer and assign a better director. Hollywood has lost it is touch in making a funny movie some long time go. And for the love of God, showing Jon's half naked, isn't going to make the movie any better.",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,ops-52535,8," a very entertaining ...
","Remake on the name fletch that used to belong to chevy chase once upon a time, and the speedy plot , deep secluded humour, and a fantastic binging of jon hamms good old friends, and jon hamms great talent for this kind of crime com edy is just perfect.",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,rjfromtoronto,2," All these excuses it's not meant to be a comedy, not in the same vein, whatever. Not an 8, maybe a 2 as far as Fletch goes.
","There's 9 reviews so far, and what I find hilarious right from the start is how many people have seen the originals, say it isn't the best and give ot a higher rating than the original which was witty, hilarious and bust your gut laughing, yes there were serious parts as well in 1 and 2, which is what some folks on here so far are calling this rendition a pseudo detective movie not a comedy. It's trying to be a comedy, don't know how anybody missed it, wonder if these reviewers actually really watched them and read the book like they say.",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,yodaman-69092,8," Very good sit down movie
",I was not sure what to expect having never seen either the Chevy movies or read the books but I can honestly say I really enjoyed this film. The comedy is funny and not always do in your face. The writing is pretty good. The soundtrack is phenomenal( especially in theaters) the direction reminds me of a classic Peter Sellers movie. It felt cool but also didn't feel too serious. I work in a movie theater so I'm always up for something different and this is different than anything I've seen this year. Not a must watch but a fun one for sure. Go into it with no expectations and you'll come out with a pretty decent cinema experience Or wait to watch it at home.,/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,B_Truth,1," Boring
",I'm a fan of the actor. But he's so completely out of his depth in the role. Shows zero of his charisma and it's just a boring movie that tries way too hard.,/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2022,actaction,7," Funny script, Need more promotion...
","Funny script, needed more promotion... as it was a well made film with real potential for bringing audiences into the movie theater, but alas studios don't seem to want to get comedies off the ground. Comedy films need solid quality content and aggressive promotion. Jon Hamm is great in the lead and I hope this picks up popularity on video so another sequel with Hamm can be made. Criticism here is I wish Fletch had actually solved the case, but his cleverness was clearly displayed. The cop characters were fun and the mystery had enough going for it to make the whodoneit fun. Nicely done film that took the simple concept and did a lot with it. Comic timing from actors/filmmakers and clever script was most impressive.",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv

19 September 2022,danieljfarthing,6," A dryer, more tepid & less fun take on 'Fletch' than the '80s original & its sequel
","Director Greg Mottola & star Jon Hamm sadly apply a dryer (even slightly tepid) tone to ""Confess Fletch"" than their counterparts (Michael Ritchie & Chevy Chase) did in the more slapstick previous 'Fletch' films (1985's ""Fletch"" & 1989's ""Fletch Lives"") - despite Mottola writing (with Zev Borrow) a relatively zany plot, involving the titular ex-investigative reporter Hamm chasing stolen paintings around Boston for beautiful Italian heiress Lorenza Izzo (and/or her step-mum Marcia Gay Harden) via art-dealer Kyle Lachlan (and others), while suspected of murder by cops Roy Wood Jnr & Ayden Mayeri (good). It's fun-ish, but nowhere near as much so as it's silly predecessors.",/review/rw8554071/?ref_=tt_urv
