1 April 2020,robertemerald,8," Utterly absurd, but wonderful space romp
","I loved all the cgi in this movie. See it on a big screen, it will be worth it. I guess you could compare it to movies such as Starship Troupers (1997) or Mars Attacks (1996). Iron Sky is a great example of what can be achieved with cgi. You may even laugh out loud. You will certainly smile for an hour and a half.",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2014,Leofwine_draca,6," Nazis on the moon, no more or less to it than that
","IRON SKY is the perfect example of a modern-day B-movie, an international collaboration boasting plenty of excellent special effects to back up an involved and engaging storyline. It's not often I watch a film and think ""there's something I haven't seen before"", but it happened with IRON SKY.",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv

28 August 2019,azathothpwiggins,," ""I'll See You In Valhalla!""...
","As we have always feared, the Nazis have been hiding on the dark side of the moon since the end of WWII. Plotting their triumphant return to power, they have waited these many decades. When an American lunar mission happens upon the enormous, hidden Nazi fortress, it causes problems both on the moon and back on Earth.",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv

","US astronauts disturb a Nazi moonbase, and the Nazis launch an expedition to earth to pick up a computer tablet to power their final invasion using a super-fuel mined from the moon.",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2012,slayerjmk95,9," Classic B-Movie
","Out of all the films being released in 2012, Iron Sky is, without a doubt, one of the most fun films to be a part of the list. When Nazis build a giant space station on the Moon after the final days of World War II, they await for the day when the Fourth Reich can return to Earth and try to conquer it again.",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2020,Kirpianuscus,," lovely
","One of admirable parodies , first for precise explore of stereotypes , second for fine acting and for the use of cliches. An U.S.A. having as president a version of Sarah Palin sounds than promising and it is one of the propositions of this seductive film about politic, hegemony, conspiracies, revenge and race. A well crafted definition of sensitive aspects from near reality.",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2020,neil-476,7," Much better than it ought to be
",A US mission to the dark side of the moon carries a high profile black celeb as a publicity stunt to help the President's re-election. And it turns out the Nazis colonised the moon at the end of WWII and are planning an invasion. Now if only they could get hold of some mobile phones with some high powered computing potential.,/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2018,nogodnomasters,8," The gift of God and science
",The only thing worse than killer rock creatures on the moon are Nazis. Astronauts discover Nazis on the far side of the moon harvesting Helium-3. (Fusion material) Soon a war erupts. The film spoofs modern society with a Sarah Palin style President who only cares about getting re-elected.,/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2020,one9eighty,8," Hilariously offensive - Reich for the stars
","This diesel-punk film picks up on a conspiracy theory of Nazi's on the moon.... Yes, that's right! In 1945 Nazi's launched a plan so epic that it takes until 2018 for it to be uncovered. They have a secret moon base on the dark side of the moon, from where they have been mining resource and building an army of flying saucers that could once again pose a threat to humanity on Earth. US astronauts accidentally uncover the base but soon regret it as they find themselves fighting for their life trying to escape, while also fighting for humanity too. The Nazi's are only a few steps away from global domination, but they decide that now is the time to act - a plan is set in motion for officers to get the equipment they need to launch the full scale war on Earth.",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2012,rune-307-115177,8," Funny and different
","I saw the film yesterday in Oslo and I must say I thought it was exhilarating, fresh and different. It's also one of those films that you either love or hate, I do not think it is one that you can be indifferent to. ",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2012,bob the moo,," Really well designed but never as sharp or as funny as needed and often a bit too silly for its own good
","Those who listen to Mark Kermode will have heard of this film quite some time ago as he frequently makes reference to the one-liner summary of this film as it has done the rounds for a while. Finally it arrived but, as interested as I was, I was also put in mind of Snakes on a Plane, another film that benefited from an odd, internet-friendly quirk to it and managed to make the most of a so-so film by virtue of its oddity and its viral marketing. Iron Sky turns out to be similar in that it doesn't live up to what it could have been, but it does actually turn out to be reasonably entertaining despite its many weaknesses and limitations.",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2012,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: Iron Sky
","If too many cooks may have spoiled the broth, then tell that to the filmmakers of Iron Sky. Possibly the first of its kind in successfully crowd-sourcing a portion of its budget from the fans (even before that term became sexy), and also taking on a collective and collaboration approach from conception to marketing the film, Iron Sky milked the Internet for what it's worth, building up a community of collaborators and fans who got involved one way or another. It showed how crowdsourcing can be reality, and arguably how inputs and help from the network at large actually became assets, rather than liabilities.",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2012,siderite,8," Too close for comfort, a good film that needs watching
","From the same people that did Star Wreck comes Iron Sky, a movie about Nazis from the dark side of the Moon coming to reclaim Earth and battling a Sara Palin style USA president. I loved Star Wreck; even if it was a little over the top, it was funny all the way: a clear homage to sci-fi series Babylon 5 and Star Trek, even when making fun of them. Iron Sky has some funny references (like a complete American version remake of the Hitler scene that was so used in YouTube videos), but in a lot of other situations it is just too realistic, like in the scene where the US spaceship is firing nukes at women and children because ""The United States does not negotiate with terrorists"".",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2012,zetes,7," The satire is a bit toothless, but in general it's a pretty funny film with a hilarious premise
","Two words: SPACE Nazis! This Finnish film posits that Nazis founded a moon colony on the dark side in the 1940s and have been secretly ramping up for war there ever since. When American astronauts run into them, it accelerates their plans for invasion. This would have made an awesome B-movie, but this is instead an amusing comedy. Christopher Kirby plays a black astronaut who gets captured. In reality, he's just a model who was recruited by the President (Stephanie Paul, mimicking Sarah Palin) to bolster her approval ratings in lieu of the upcoming election. Udo Kier, the only recognizable actor in the piece, plays the moon fuhrer. Gotz Otto plays a Nazi leader who wishes to usurp that position. Julia Dietze plays a Nazi schoolteacher and Otto's fiancée. Otto and Dietze go on a reconaissance mission to Earth to prepare for the invasion, but Paul and her campaign manager (Peta Sergeant) give them political power by making them her speechwriters (she loves their powerful rhetoric and jackbooted style). Meanwhile, Kirby, changed into an albino by Nazi scientists, becomes a hobo trying to convince people that the Moon Nazis are coming to invade Earth. The political satire is more than a bit dated - I mean, Sarah Palin, really? This must have been written several years ago, one would think. But it's often very funny, and it looks great for what I assume is a pretty low-budget film. Kirby in particular is wonderful and Dietze is a real doll.",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2012,jpkwolf,9," Great sci-fi comedy about Nazis from the moon
","I have followed Iron Sky since the very beginning. I loved director Timo Vuorensola's first movie Star Wreck. It was camp, funny and the space battles were epic and the story was enjoyable. So I was expecting something similar but slightly better with a bigger budget from Iron Sky.",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2012,kosmasp,7," A for effort
","A multilingual movie, this is really a very absurd idea taking to the max. I guess you know what the premise is (it's one of those one joke made into a feature film types of movies) and I do think it works. The success in Germany at least shows that people will buy into the hype and watch anything, as crazy as it might sound. This movie deserved that kind of attention.",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2014,svtcobra331,10," Fantastic
","I had no idea what to expect from this movie, and I dreaded it was going to be plain stupid. The first ten minutes or so of the movie seemed to confirm my fears. Then I realized the story was being told with stereotypes. Stereotype black American male. Stereotype US Prez (brilliant sendup of Gov Palin), stereotypical patriotic schoolteacher, totally believing everything she'd been told about ""how loving and great Hitler was"".

11 May 2012,evan_harvey,4," In a word, ""Meh"".
","Just saw it, and am still astounded at the incompetence of the writers of this film. How could you take such a great idea like moon Nazis and then create a film so excruciatingly dull? There were about 3-4 genuinely funny moments (and admittedly they were very good), but overall it sucked like a brand new vacuum cleaner. I have never before wanted a film to end as much as I did while watching Iron Sky. It didn't help that there was a pack of fat unwashed nerds behind us wetting themselves at everything, even if it wasn't a joke, but the content on-screen was so lame.",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2021,dderek-46564,8," If you can't get subtle humor, you won't get this movie
","There are a bunch of 1 star reviews of people who just aren't smart enough to get subtle humor. This movie is pretty funny if you can read through the lines and get the jokes. The people who made this movie did their homework on Nazi Germany. There are MP40 and STG44 guns made into space guns. Priceless! A woman calls a german soldier a ""Crystal Nacht POS"". Thats funny if you know your history. The black guy being turned into and Aryan is also funny because its so unbelievable. Christopher Kirby is really good and has some great lines. There are some good one liners, the CGI is really good for a low budget movie. Space Zeppelins, another classic. A Sarah Palinesque US President. So many good ideas.",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2012,TheSquiss,1," Not quite the worst film of the year so far, but close.
","Iron Sky certainly isn't the worst film of the year so far (that accolade belongs to Act of Valour) but it is the worst of the past seven days and that's a week that included Piranha 3DD! There are plot spoilers ahead so if you're still interested in seeing the film after my opening line, I'd suggest we part company now. Feel free to drop me a line, though, if you watch Iron Sky and it all makes sense to you. I'd be intrigued to hear how somebody of sound mind could defend it.",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2012,dan-1315,8," Hillariously Offensive
","Didn't know anything about the movie when I saw it, and I found it hilariously offensive. This is a Finnish-German-Australian science- fiction comedy made with fan donations that winds up making a lot of fun of Nazis, Americans, and even a few jokes about the Finns and the Australians.",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2020,steve-ruzicka,8," Do you know movies and history?
","It's the second time I saw Iron Sky and my rating increased from 6 to 8.
As most of the time, I go to IMDB after having seen a movie to check how other viewers reacted. First of all, people show use extreme ratings more carefully.
Just giving a 1 does not make sense, even if the movie was disliked. Iron Sky is of course second degree humor, requiring some basic understanding of the second world war. Numerous references are also made to other movies. I would need a third viewing. So kudos to the Iron Sky fans and donators. And the followup movie is a pleasure to watch as well. We say in French ""déjanté"". Enjoy.",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2012,andre-71,8," politically incorrect humor at its best
","Considering the budget of the movie, this film is superb! Considering the filmography of the Finnish crew, this film has clearly reached a technically and dramatically mature level (though, Star Wrek was also technically very good). Most outstanding is, of course, the tongue-in-cheek humor.",/review/rw2606219/?ref_=tt_urv
