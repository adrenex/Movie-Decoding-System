9 February 2019,rustonreviews,7," A fun little thriller.
","Drawing influences from Saw (2004), Final Destination (2000), and Cube (1997), Escape Room follows six individuals, all of whom receive a puzzle box prescribing a cryptic note inviting them to the Minos Escape Room Facility. Lured to the facility under the promise of receiving a cash prize of ten thousand dollars, these six strangers must endure several intricately designed puzzle rooms in a thrilling game of life or death. While the premise doesn't exactly scream originality, Escape Room is a perfectly enjoyable little thriller. For those expecting buckets of gore and sickening death scenes, look elsewhere, as Schut and Melnik's screenplay is much more attuned to focusing on the elaborate puzzles themselves, resulting in a film that intrigues rather than disturbs. Pace wise, the film doesn't slow down and is engaging throughout, some of the puzzle rooms are quite visually arresting, and thankfully the characters aren't just one dimensional zeroes either. While the ending does border on nonsensical, Escape Room is a still a fun film that is definitely worth checking out.",/review/rw4559376/?ref_=tt_urv

12 August 2020,CronenbergsMonster,5," Falls apart at the end
","Dont believe the 10/10 or the 1/10 reviews. This movie falls almost squarely in the middle. The premise is essentially a PG-13 Saw movie with multiple puzzle rooms for the protagonists to escape (rather than torture devices). There are some really great set pieces, tense moments, and decent acting throughout. However, the film completely falls apart in the last act. Its clearly meant to be setup for a franchise, which completely belittles everything in the first 3/4 of the film and ruins all the goodwill established up to that point. This could have been a really competent thriller if it werent for the money-grabbing shill of an ending. As it stands, this is basically a sub-par ""Cube."" 5/10 for me; I cant fully recommend it.",/review/rw4559376/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2020,Leofwine_draca,5," Adequate thriller, nothing more
","ESCAPE ROOM is a generic kind of thriller that trades on the newfound popularity of thriller experiences, in which a group of friends willingly allow themselves to be locked in escape rooms before solving puzzles to facilitate their escape. A real-life CRYSTAL MAZE, if you will. I've seen a previous and very similar B-movie that wasn't very good, but this one is more mainstream and bigger budgeted, so there's more emphasis on effects. I found it quite similar to that '90s cult classic CUBE, although of course nowhere near as good, lacking as it does interesting characters and only tending to generate a minimum of suspense despite all the screaming and shouting.",/review/rw4559376/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2021,TRIDENT1745,7," Your Everyday Time Passing Thriller
","The story is simple, the acting is very average, except for Taylor Russell. There is good suspense and adequate thrill. A great movie for munching on popcorn and passing the time.",/review/rw4559376/?ref_=tt_urv

",A decent enough movie with great tension and edge of the seat thrills.,/review/rw4559376/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,drpainters,7," Pretty cool
","It's a really cool concept. Kind of takes over for the final destination franchise. Not a bloody movie either, they do cuts before anything gross happens. Sets up nicely for a sequel. Hope to see a few of these.",/review/rw4559376/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2019,dsayshi257,6," For what it is, it isn't bad
","You could tell by the trailers that this isn't an oscar winning movie. It's a thrilling, fun, easy watch and for what it is, it's pretty good. The acting isn't bad, it's a pretty cliche story but it exceeded my expectations! It's not bad but it's not fantastic. If you're a fan of these types of movies, you won't be let down!",/review/rw4559376/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,8," I'm surprised at how good this film is.
","I was adamant that I had seen this film, until I realised I had seen a film a few years back, called Escape Room, with virtually the same plot, the difference, being that was poor, this was actually really good.",/review/rw4559376/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2021,misanthr0pist,7," A lot better than I expected
","A really fun little thriller!
The writing was a tad lackluster in some parts, but overall it didn't kill the mood. Same can be said about predictability, but again, it didn't ruin the film.
Set design was excellent, and each room/game was well put together. It also managed to keep the tension at a fun level throughout. I'll definitely be watching the sequel when (or if) it gets released.",/review/rw4559376/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2019,Scorcesio,7," Cube did it better, but still fun!
","The entire movie, all I could think of was Cube and how this movie was definitely inspired by it. The beginning starts off like an eye rolling Netflix B-horror, but it really does get better! Very tense moments and the room concepts are great. You'll have a lot of fun watching!",/review/rw4559376/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2019,valtierraitza,9," To my surprise, I enjoyed this movie!
","Went in without watching trailers or reading any background info on it. My friends really wanted to see so I tagged along. With horror movies, I never get my hopes up as it's hard to find a good one these days. I surprisingly really enjoyed the concept of this movie and would consider it more of a thriller. It never bored me and it wasn't gory like the saw films (which I never enjoyed). I liked the characters and their backgrounds.. it was nice to see how they all tied in together. It was a pretty good movie and I'd recommend.",/review/rw4559376/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2019,lukehasenfus,7," Escape Room
","This movie is a fun joy ride and is something that won't waste your time. Although it isn't Oscar worthy, it is a film that is enjoying to watch and get excited about. I highly recommend this film to just watch for a good time.",/review/rw4559376/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2019,dynamiteheaddy-43387,6," A disaster of an ending
","Starts off fairly strong with interesting escape rooms but there comes a point in the third act where the movie just goes badly down hill with one of the worst endings in recent memory. They are clearly trying to set up a franchise with the sequel bait but with an ending this weak and unoriginal I can't see anyone wanting to watch it, The film isn't clever and doesn't have a decent twist to save it. Its just a rip off Saw (minus the gore) probably in the hope they can make more money. It's a shame because there are some enjoyable parts but expect any future films to go straight to DVD.",/review/rw4559376/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2019,rgkarim,8," Escaping The Normal Slasher/Horror Formula
","The age of horror took a major turn when the Saw series unleashed its gory thrills to the Hollywood industry. Sadly, the very edge and gimmicks it brought grew stale, as sequel after sequel appeared to dilute the quality and originality. Soon carbon copies came in, eventually flooding the market with mediocre films that didn't do much to progress the genre. Still, there are always those hopes that some quality still lurks in the chaotic slew that is this genre.

12 January 2019,prostatus-05664,4," Not that amazing, not terrible, but probably not worth your time for theaters
","The acting was pretty cringeworthy and bad, the black guy was pretty terrible actor and the fisherman guy wasnt so hot either..The rest did fine or alright but the other two definitely kind of dragged things down..Interesting and intriguing at some points, boring and cliche at others..Kinda cool twist and concept I suppose near end but overall the terrible acting and kind of same plot doing same thing over and over and kind of stupidity of cliche backstories placed in, 4/10.",/review/rw4559376/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2019,nogodnomasters,8," Follow the Light to Green Pastures.
","The film opens with Ben (Logan Miller ) being crushed and then goes back to three days earlier. We are introduced to three people who have the potential of being the ""Final Girl."" One of which is Ben. Zoey (Taylor Russell) is a super smart student and Jason (Jay Ellis) is a shrewd businessman. They and others get a personal invitation to try the Minos Escape Room for a chance of a $10,000 prize. The rooms can be deadly as they soon discover and the numbers whittle down.",/review/rw4559376/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2019,thebricks,10," A much needed reworked Saw movie sans gore and torture
","I loved the first Saw movie, but got tired of subsequent movies because the gore and torture got a bit too much to watch. It actually was a decent movie and is kind of rewatchable, I'll admit. I did feel at times that the characters were a bit too smart to discover certain things as quickly as they did. Still, for a January release, you expect the worst but it actually was pretty good.",/review/rw4559376/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2019,thailerrhyne,4," It's scary that some people are giving this 10/10
","Don't get me wrong, the people who are saying ""1 star, it's visual vomit"" are being dramatic. But this movie is not good. It's beginning and half way point are somewhat decent. Plot wise I mean. Acting and visual effects are lacking in many areas. But the second half till the end is horribly executed. The fact that it sequel baits you hard at the end is also a little insulting. Save your money. Do a real escape room instead.",/review/rw4559376/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2019,alesjonestrader,9," A clever cross between Saw and Belko Experiment
","I saw this film with my wife and in-laws - just a few days after we all went to a an actual ""escape room"". Astonishingly, everybody including myself was impressed with this film. You know you have a good movie when all generations of a family like it!",/review/rw4559376/?ref_=tt_urv
