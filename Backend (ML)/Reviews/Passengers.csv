20 June 2011,jantoniou,6," Likable Sandler-fare, as usual
","Adam Sandler is getting pretty solid at producing and acting in quasi-poignant tales that get him somewhat further away - and, ultimately, closer to (doesn't make sense, I know) - from his proto-Sandler-style of filmmaking that has his vaguely proto-typical cast of characters - hapless, hopeless geeks, improbable ladies' man, a ""nice guy"" that all the ladies want, but still seem to settle on the douches. Sandler brings his ""crew"" together - former/current SNLers, Allen Covert (who is pretty much in every Sandler movie that I can think of), and some heavy-hitters occasionally. ""The Wedding Singer,"" ""Grown-Ups,"" and, now, ""Just Go With It"" all pander to this amiable style of film-making that is at times borderline gross-out - but just pulls away before you realize this probably isn't an Apatow-slacker movie, nor is attempting to be.",/review/rw2908044/?ref_=tt_urv

","Just Go With It is at times dreadfully boring and extremely unfunny as it approaches the two hour mark and we are still waiting to laugh.

2 October 2011,TheLittleSongbird,6," Decent if unexceptional
","I am not a fan of Adam Sandler, though I have liked some of his performances and films, but when Jennifer Aniston has good material she is good. I was expecting Just Go with It to be crap, but while it was unexceptional on the whole I found it decent. Both Sandler and Anniston have done better, both have also done worse. Sandler is not amazing, but he is not as irritating as he can be. Anniston's role is one-dimensional, but she is beguiling and the chemistry they have is likable. Nicky Swardson, who I can't stand usually, is also good. The film looks appealing, is directed assuredly and the soundtrack is fitting and not too generic. The script however while having some funny and tender moments has a number of weak moments coming across as stilted and cloying. The story is rather thin and predictable especially the ending, and the characters while appealingly performed are generally under-developed and stereotyped. All in all, a decent and better than expected film but not great. 6/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2908044/?ref_=tt_urv

","Like most sit-coms the movie slips from possible to improbable to very improbable. Adam Sandler plays Danny, who is about to be married. He discovers his bride to be had a fling with her former bf right before the wedding and she is just marrying him for his money. Danny is depressed as he sits in a bar with his wedding ring on. He discovers the ring is a chick magnet that leads to numerous one night stands. He calls it ""my precious."" Jennifer Anniston plays his single receptionist with 2 children. At a party, Danny meets a Barbie Doll school teacher and has a great night. He wasn't wearing his ring, but then she discovers it! You cad! Danny eventually explains he is getting divorced and she insists upon meeting the soon to be ex-wife. Rather than level with her, he asks Jennifer to play the role of his ex-wife which includes make-over and clothes perks. The meeting goes well as Anniston plays the jilted wife...then her cell phone rings. It is her kids, which must be Danny's kids too, right? Barbie Doll, a teacher loves kids and wants to meet Danny's kids. Now Danny must bribe Anniston's kids to pretend to be his kids. Oh what a tangle web we weave...",/review/rw2908044/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2011,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: Just Go With It
","Director Dennis Dugan was responsible for a number of comedies with funnyman Adam Sandler, from Happy Gilmore to Big Daddy in the 90s, to the more recent fare of I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry, You Don't Mess with the Zohan, and Grown Ups. I'm a big fan of some of these if I may say low brow offerings, but hey, don't berate me for having a good time. As with most of the comedies Sandler has starred in thus far, most straddle between two broad areas of being funny, and yet having some major drama and/or romantic fare to bulk up the running time, making the films seem more like two halves put together.",/review/rw2908044/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2011,zardoz-13,8," Just Grin At It!
","Adam Sandler is really getting mellow in his forties. ""Happy Gilmore"" director Dennis Dugan's ""Just Go With It"" qualifies as an uneven, predictable, but entertaining farce for the former ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian. Sandler looks like he had a blast as a smart aleck Jewish plastic surgeon who masquerades as a hen-pecked husband so he can bed down with beautiful babes. No Sandler comedy would be complete without his distinctive brand of infantile humor. ""Just Go With It"" boasts its share of absurdly ludicrous moments. The best example depicts Sandler's co-star Nick Swardson of ""Reno 911!"" as he performs the Heimlich maneuver on an obviously artificial sheep that has swallowed a rubber toy. Surprisingly enough, this lightweight, PG-13 rated, romantic comedy spends most of its 117 minutes being cute and endearing rather than toxic and offensive. Mind you, Sandler and company ridicule the generation gap, gays, marriage, plastic surgery, bowel movements, erectile dysfunction, and mendacity. What ultimately sets ""Just Go With It"" apart from the usual Sandler shenanigans is the presence of upscale co-stars Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman. Kidman has never been such a clown. Together they prove that a woman doesn't have to be a twenty-something nymph, like drop-dead gorgeous swimsuit model Brooklyn Decker, to bound around in a bikini. Although Dugan and scenarists Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling have essentially remade the 1969 Walter Matthau comedy ""Cactus Flower,"" ""Just Go With It"" resembles the classic Blake Edwards comedy ""10"" with Dudley Moore and Bo Derek. In ""10"" (1979), a middle-aged man pursued a twenty year old babe before he realized that their age gap made them incompatible. Dugan lenses the graceful Decker in slow-motion as she jogs through the surf. These moments are comparable to painter Sandro Botticelli's picture of Venus on a Half-Shell.

","Just Go With It sits in the middle of the best and worst Adam Sandler films this side of the millennium. Many, considerable pitfalls exists. Sandler piles on the lies to get his girl. Firstly, pretending to have an ex-wife (Jennifer Aniston), because Sandler gets caught wearing his old wedding ring that scores him many girls (in his dreams). Secondly, having two children when he has none. Thirdly, his cousin Nick Swardson enters the fray, pretending to be Aniston's new German backpacker boyfriend. The lies are awful and flimsy. The charade's kept up for the entire movie. It'd be convincing if Sandler was only trying to get his leg over. Some laughs come from it, just not many memorable ones. Aniston is the prize winner here. She's the good in a jumble of mess. This film is aptly named, as if it's telling us just to go with it too.",/review/rw2908044/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2019,ironhorse_iv,5," This movie is awful! I can't go with it.
","I can't believe, this 2011 comedy written by screenwriters, Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling, is a loosely based remake of the 1969 film 'Cactus Flower'. Nor could I imagine; that this was also an adaptation of an earlier successful, Broadway and French stage play of the same name. It was truly a less than stellar motion picture. Directed by Dennis Dugan, the film tells the story of Danny Maccabee (Adam Sandler) trying to fool his much younger fianc√©e, Palmer Dodge (Brooklyn Decker) into believing that he is divorcing a make believe pretend wife, Katherine Murphy (Jennifer Aniston), when Palmer sees his fake wedding ring, during their first date. Without spoiling this Happy Madison Production movie too much, I can see the original writer Abe Burrows spinning in his grave. Why? It's because this remake was not funny. None of the crass, juvenile toilet humor, including jokes at the expense of the overweight or physically imperfect, landed for me. It didn't help that Sandler slept through this movie. Don't get me wrong, Adam does have some talent. He did displayed some depth and emotional range before. However, Sandler in this film, look like he could care less if this flick was a success or not. He put nearly no effort in his role, going back to his usual shtick, performing as the angry man child. Because of this, Danny comes across as very annoying, tiresome and unlikeable. It doesn't help that the character is a chauvinist pig for the most part, lying to women and being a jerk to others, due to one lady making fun of him in the past. Look, I'm willing to ignore and forgive the romantic lead for lying to the love interest in order to win her heart like the original movie, but lying for years upon years to multiple ladies and painting himself as a victim of domestic abuse is downright disturbing and wrong. I have no amount of sympathy for a guy that spends two decades manipulating women to become home wreckers, in order to sleep with them. Talk about being highly misogynist. So, it was really hard for us to overlook Danny's past events and root for him, even if he has a character arc, from debauch bachelor to semi good, family man. Also, as a rich plastic surgeon, he still broke multiple Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act rules, by discussing patient information to his friends. That's not good. As for Aniston's character, the same can go with her. I hate that Katherine knew about his womanizing from the beginning, and didn't do anything to stop it for years. It made me miss so much, the original 1969 character played by actress Ingrid Bergman. I like that she had no clue of the scheme at first. It made her seem so innocent. Plus, I like how her character was somewhat dowdy. So, it was nice to see her bloom into an attractive woman in the end of that film, rather than being already generically sexy like Katherine during this movie. Despite, the lackluster and plain performance from Aniston. She still lightyears better than Brooklyn Decker's so call acting. Besides her good looks, the model turn actress's character is so lifeless, bland and dull. When you compare Palmer to the heavily flaw free spirited original character played by Golden Hawn in the first movie. It's no match. Hawn's flower child performance, wins all the time. Decker's character is just that forgettable. Although, the main cast were below average, the supporting performers were a little bit better. I kinda love Nicole Kidman as Delvin Adams. The scene with her and Katherine dancing in a contest was somewhat funny, but very hot. She was very entertaining. As for Nick Swardson, I do dig him as the over the top cartoony character of Dolph Lundgren. The surreal dialogue given to him while highly unrealistic, is so out there bizarre, that I can't help laughing, even with the scene of him drowning Palmer to keep up with the deception. I also have to give props to musician Dave Matthews. His delivery of comedic lines are top notch. Who knew that he can act! Honestly, the only supporting characters, I didn't like, were the kids. They were a little too precocious & so very annoying. No wonder, why Danny told Palmer that those fake kids of his, has been killed in a tragic accident, after throwing one of them into the mud. Nobody really liked them not even their mother Katherine. Not only that, the whole Hawaii vacation idea that the children came out with is really stretching the logistic of the plot, very thin. I find it very unlikely, that anybody in real life would spent millions of dollars of lying material, just to get a woman he barely knows to engage with him within a week. The whole plan seem unrealistic, very rushed and last, but not least, highly superficial. Honestly, there is no reason for any of this charade as Danny couldn't even marry Palmer if he wanted to. Why? It's because he didn't divorce his fake wife yet. No wedding ceremony would even allow this. Even if this could happen. The film wouldn't show it. Oddly, all the dumping was done, off screen. What a disappointing cheap cop out! While, the film didn't showcases that, it was kind enough to show us, plenty of product placement advertisement for Pizza Hut and hotels in Hawaii. Because of this, the movie felt more like a travel brochure than anything else. It's not good. Overall: Just watch the 1969 version of this film. It's so much better than its offspring, any day. That's for sure.",/review/rw2908044/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a horrible movie that actually made me laugh a bunch of times but that still doesn't save it from my rating. The laughs have absolutely nothing to do with the plot and are mostly sight gags. The entire premise is absurd, instead of telling the truth to the new girl he met about wearing a wedding ring he concocts a lie so complicated and stupid it could never work under any circumstances. One point being the idea that he is automatically going to stay with this girl even though they only had one night together but still creates situations that would not work in any future with her.

26 March 2016,Horst_In_Translation,4," A weaker Sandler movie
","""Just Go with It"" is a 5-year-old comedy that got featured (like most of Sandler's works) at the Razzie Awards as well as several awards shows for younger audiences. It is the American approach to an originally Indian film. The director is Dennis Dugan and I cannot say I am too familiar with him. Same goes for all the writers working on this one. Always a bit disappointing if there are so many and the outcome is still a letdown. Sandler may not be the most talented actor, but he does a decent job in picking roles and that's why the character here fits him nicely once again. Aniston also has more pros than cons. Sadly, I cannot say the same about Brooklyn Decker, who just is not a particularly gifted actress and at times it felt she was only in her to show us her great swimsuit body. At least the Andy Roddick cameo was funny at the end. And then there is Nicole Kidman, who seems stupid and unlikeable for all her early scenes and then somehow out of nowhere gets some depth and emotion added to her character. That was embarrassing. It was so obvious that they only included her final scene because it was Nicole Kidman playing the character. Cringeworthy stuff. I would feel sorry for her because of how low she has sunk, but then I remember she has won an Oscar and is a truly mediocre actress, always has been and I don't feel sorry for her anymore.",/review/rw2908044/?ref_=tt_urv
