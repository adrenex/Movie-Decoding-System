",I just read some reviews from other people and I don't understand why they think it was too long. It was only 4 episodes and the episodes are less than 40 minutes each. They go so fast!,/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2022,Sleepin_Dragon,8," David Vs Goliath.
","Back when advertising campaigns were very, very different, Pepsi launched an audacious, fun campaign, Pepsi points for prizes, 7 million, would get you a Harrier jet.....just fun right, not for John Leonard.",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,boself,9," Amazing storytelling
","Although I was in my twenties in the nineties, I didn't know this story (I'm from Europe). That means I didn't know the ending. Some people here commenting on how it could've been told in five minutes... I don't agree! I simply don't. Since it eventually became highly discussed law book material, it was complex matter.",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2022,AudioFileZ,7," Marketing For...No, Marketing By Dummies
","In a perfect marketplace products win by offering the best mix of attributes for the consumer over the competition. When this is no longer the case things get more complicated. The consumer must be manipulated in some way the actual product takes a back seat. For perpetual underdog soda manufacturer Pepsi to dethrone Coca-Cola the answer was spending huge amounts of money on advertisements, and, as this film details, promotions.",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2022,mignonette1,10," Excellent storytelling!
","This is a rare gem of a docuseries! I don't usually watch feel-good documentaries but I'm really glad i watched this. It's often hilarious, the soundtrack is fantastic and perfectly timed, the editing and directing are so well done you can actually feel how much they enjoyed making this documentary, and how much fun they were having with it! If you're looking for a lighthearted story-time that asks it's audience for nothing but a few hours, look no further. You will not be disappointed!",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2022,jenniferpattison,8," I'll have a Coke thanks
","I really like the way this story was told and shot. It kept me very interested and I couldn't wait to finish it. However, after watching this documentary, I am disgusted with Pepsi and their lack of morality. The fat cats at the top of the soda empire should be ashamed or at least admit fault that they ran an ad (that THEY approved) that was incredibly misleading and honestly false advertising. And what they did in the Philippines was simply unjustifiable. Plus the fact that the judge wouldn't let the defense depose anyone or have a jury trial was bulls**t. Pure corporate greed. Definitely a David and Goliath story that unfortunately ends like most corporate cases in America. Our justice system desperately needs revamped. In the meantime, I'll only be buying Coke products.",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2022,hello-41123,9," Interesting how corporate America works
","I had no idea about any of this since I did not grow up in American in the 90s. Do not believe the bad review, this is something that got put I to law school textbook case study for a reason.",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2022,HoskTheCub,9," Dude only wanted his jet
","Netflix documentaries strength is about telling a story about people. Whether he should or not should have a jet is an interesting topic, but that's not why it should be a 4 episode documentary. It needs that time for us to cozy down and immerse ourselves in the lives of the participants.",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2022,Mr-Fusion,5," Stretched way too thin
","It was one of those ""weird facts"" posts always bouncing around social media, the kid that saved up the Pepsi points and then demanded the harrier jet he'd seen in the commercial. It was a wild story and a humorous consequence of reckless advertising. You can find plenty of YouTube videos on the subject, and that's probably as far as you should take it.",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,SteverB,10," Excellent!
","I was around in the 90s and have no recollection of this story, so this was a nice surprise from Netflix. To me, it was a compelling documentary of a David vs. Goliath story that was just the right length. The inserts of the mountain climbing were used to great effect to illustrate the dual stories of climbing a mountain and gaining a close friend out of an unlikely situation.",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,KinoBuff2021,7," A Cool and Refreshing Documentary Series
","This is a pretty good series! I know I was hooked as soon as I saw the trailer for the series, but the series lived up to my expectations.",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,paul-allaer,7," You can't make this stuff up!
","As Episode 1 of ""Pepsi, Where's My Jet"" (2022 release; 4 episodes ranging from 36 to 43 min) opens, we are introduced to the cutting edge ad campaigns by Pepsi in the 90s, as the cola wars raged between Coke and Pepsi. In 1995, Pepsi launched the ""Drink Pepsi, Get Stuff"" campaign, including ""7,000,000 points: Harrier Fight"" (the military jet that can take off and land vertically). John Leonard, a 20 yo from Seattle, facies that jet and starts plotting a way to collect 7,000,000 Pepsi points. At this point we are 10 min into Episode 1.",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2022,pandora1988,8," Fun but a bit too long
","This was a very interesting case study in contract law. In all honesty, I think the judge should have awarded them something. I can see where kids might think it's possible...and I can see how an ambitious kid could have done so. Add in the fraud they committed in the Philippines and basically murdered a woman, I don't think I'll ever drink Pepsi again...not that I do much anyway.",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2022,vodkkaa,5," A single episode would be enough
","I didn't like the show because it dragged too much. The whole story could be told in 1h or so. The friendship and adventures are nice, but the mountain climbing had too much screen time.",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2022,LincolnSixEko,3," WAY too much filler.
",The filmmakers are trying too hard to make something flashy when they should've focused on delivering the story in a more focused and streamlined way.,/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2022,opotraining,5," Interesting and also not Interesting
",Netflix should either make a complete documentray or make a series. They mix both in this. There was no need to recreate the scenes happened 25 years ago with different actors. The present day story of both John and Todd hiking in snow is totally useless. The old videos shown were enough and that's the good part. Recreated videos were just bad with bad actors.,/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2022,frosty-44431,2," How to prolong a five minutes conersation

18 November 2022,angotti81,7," A fun romp through a legal battle that made 90's headlines
","As far as documentaries go this one felt less one sided than most. It certainly keeps you rooting for John and his twenty year old dream to win a falsely advertised Harrier jet. But in the same token it really is a David VS Goliath story, and keeps it relatively light hearted. Pepsi is never overtly painted as the bad guy, and their Ad execs and creatives are allowed to chime in. John and his friend Todd share a great bond over climbing and it's heartwarming at times, especially the fourth and last episode.",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2022,jugglergirl,10," Hilarious Story, Hilarious Documentary
","This story has always been one of my favorite "" Epic mistake"" stories and the documentary does not disapoint. A hilarious story about a the Pepsi ad where they ""offered"" a Harrier Jet if you collected 7 million Pepsi points and the young kid who took them up on their offer. Of course Pepsi claimed they weren't really offering a jet, it was a joke. It is a great object lesson in why you should think about what you say, lest someone call you on it. On how you should always, always do the math, (this story is discussed in a book called Humble Pi, about big math errors and their consequences). And on how you should never underestimate a persons dedication to an idea. I am perhaps a little biased as I have always loved stories like this. The little guy trying to stick to the man, exploiting loopholes, and dedicating everything to ridiculous ideas.",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2022,Jeremy_Urquhart,5," A good documentary killed by the need to be four parts (& 160-ish minutes)
","A 3/5 or even 3.5/5 feature documentary needlessly inflated to about 160 minutes, in four episodes.",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2022,rtrsgwr,10," What a great anecdote!!
","This story begins with the ad claiming that you can get a harrier jet if you collect 7,000,000 pepsi point, which is not so unrealistic offer. And that is the point of this story because a college student named John Leonard really believed that and he and his mom started to drink boxes of colas in order to collect the points. Having an ambitious friend named Todd, who offered tremendous amount of money for John's insane plan to get the jet, John squarely fought one of the biggest companies around the world. He might sound crazy but he apparently believes its ad and truly imagines the plan after getting the jet. Yes, John is crazy, but his friend Todd has his spot, and I was impressed by his words for multiple times. This story is not just a stupid comedy because of his.profound insight and significant word, regardless of the outcome. Must watch!",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2022,pgleite,8," Really Loved it
","When I first saw this documentary in my Netflix suggestions I was very entrigered by the title and I didn't knew this story so I took the risk and I immediatly started to see. After I finish it, I can tell this was a fantastic story very well narrated with some humour cleverly mixed. I love the way the story was told and the way keep pushing me to see more in the next episode.",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2022,smnenkov,10," A reminder on what a good documentary is! Brilliant 10/10
","I know oscars and other awards are usually granted only to ""serious"" movies which are often sad and long. And many do deserve them.",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2022,PlutoZoo,1," Fizzles out quickly. More padding than a Bouncy Castle.
","I had found the trailer for this interesting but halfway through the first tedious episode it became apparent that it has been padded beyond belief and that, what should be a one hour documentary at the very maximum, had been stretched to a 4x40 mins series. It's so padded, it's tedious.",/review/rw8684238/?ref_=tt_urv
