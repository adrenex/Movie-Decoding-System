9 July 2003,Anonymous_Maxine,9," Wait, you mean all I have to do is become God to solve all my problems? Why didn't I think of that before???
","Jim Carrey is back to much the same role that he played in The Mask, a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck. Even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums (and of course they have to be Mexican, obviously), his good will towards his fellow man backfires. In that case, it wasn't too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums, but I like that the movie suggests that  things like that shouldn't be ignored. I'm reminded of the episode of Michael Moore's brilliant The Awful Truth, when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay. The results were not very promising, so it's nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example.",/review/rw5921181/?ref_=tt_urv

","Now either you like Mr Carrey's humour or you don't. Me, Myself and Irene had audiences both walking out in droves and, on the other hand, cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth. Bruce Almighty is a bit more mainstream, but you have been warned.",/review/rw5921181/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2004,helpless_dancer,8," Carrey does it again
","Well, was Morgan Freeman any more unusual as God than George Burns? This film sure was better than that bore, ""Oh, God"". I was totally engrossed and LMAO all the way through. Carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe, and Aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance. I, for one, don't consider her to be either ugly or untalented. I think my favorite scene was when Carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history. See if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor: I was rolling over this one. Well written and even better played out, this comedy will go down as one of this funnyman's best.",/review/rw5921181/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2003,BlackX,8," What if God was one of us? It would be pretty funny.
","I really do not know what people have against this film, but it's definitely one of my favourites. It's not preachy, it's not anchored by it's moral, it shouldn't be controversial. It's just God. Any possible God, no matter the religion. And it's really funny.",/review/rw5921181/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2020,educallejero,5," Ultra predictable, but entertaining
","This movie rest in the shoulders of Jim Carrey. There is almost literally nothing more.
We see a bit of his life before getting ""God's powers"" and then the adventure and predictable tale about ""thinking well what you wish for"", basically.
Carrey is not ""The Mask"" or ""Ace Ventura"" level of obnoxious, so the movie flows well with mostly dumb jokes, some better than others, and a bunch of actual real written jokes too.
Jennifer Anniston is there. It doesn't matter.
Steve Carrell has a criminal ultra small role, but he's the best part of the movie regardless.
It's a fine comedy with not much more to it than a predictable but well done message",/review/rw5921181/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2008,ccthemovieman-1,8," Lightweight, Fun Look At Thelogy
","As someone who lives near Buffalo, New York, this movie scored points with me before I even saw it, since the story is based here. There are even some bit parts with real-life news-TV anchor people from Buffalo..and, for once, it doesn't knock the area. Hallelujah!",/review/rw5921181/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2003,Special-K88,," Carrey delivers
","Broad, amusing, well-intended comic fantasy about an ambitious Buffalo reporter who hates his job and dreams of becoming a news anchor. After suffering from some hard luck, the reporter directs his anger toward God whom he feels is ignoring him completely, until he has an unexpected celestial encounter that endows him with divine powers that allow him to see the truth. Well-crafted comedy suffers from occasional lapses due to conventional story elements, but it's good-natured and consistently laugh-out loud funny, with some terrific sight gags, clever ideas, and a perfect part for Carrey who makes a welcomed return to the kind of silliness that made him a star. ***",/review/rw5921181/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2017,HotToastyRag,5," Jim Carrey's last hit
","Bruce Almighty had such a promising premise: a man, disillusioned with God, suddenly meets The Man is given his powers. Prayers come in to Bruce, and he has ""almighty"" power to do whatever he wants, which, since this is a comedy, includes adjusting his girlfriend's breast size and destroying a co-worker's career.",/review/rw5921181/?ref_=tt_urv

",Jim Carrey awesomeness throughout! I remember being little and seeing Bruce Almighty with my family in the theater that was precious! Quite enjoyable entertainment that is always a delightful with great effects and comedy that's memorable. I will say though I'm not a fan of the religious stuff but if anything this is my favorite one with aspects of Christianity.,/review/rw5921181/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you want a serious laugh pain, watch this movie, and the things Bruce inflicts on his fellow newscaster. The deleted scenes are priceless. I don't know why they didn't include them in the original movie. It can't be because of time, since the movie is only 101 minutes long. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor, who has been overlooked for too long. Jim Carrey needs meds!",/review/rw5921181/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2008,joe-elliott2,7," Averages out to be pretty good
","Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels God is messing up his life. God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving someone God's powers could take a turn for the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well. The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God, not only that but also as a black man. I thought this quite well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for instance, others miss the target slightly but still a good film. 6/7 out of 10",/review/rw5921181/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2003,claudio_carvalho,5," I Expected Much More Than That
","Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is an external and funny TV network correspondent, competing with his colleague Evan Baxter (Steven Carell) the position of 'anchor' in the TV news. He lives with Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston), a teacher of children, who loves and wants to marry him. Bruce is a very selfish, grudging and envious man. While presenting a live event in Niagara Falls, he is informed that Evan was chosen as the new anchor man. Bruce gets crazy, says a lot of wicked and non-sense things to the audience and is fired. Bruce blames God, and sooner he is called by Him. God (Morgan Freeman) decides to go on vacations for a week and gives all His powers and duties to Bruce, but the power of changing the free will. With his greed, Bruce commits lots of mistakes, but in the end he is redeemed. The plot of this movie could be funnier. However, the nasty personality of Bruce does not help much. Jennifer Aniston is beautiful as usual and performs a nice character. I myself expected much more of this movie. My vote is five.",/review/rw5921181/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2005,J. Spurlin,," Even God thinks Jim Carrey is God's gift to comedy in this repulsive effort
","Whenever I watch Jim Carrey I get the feeling he's grabbing me by the collar, slamming his face into mine and screaming, ""Laugh at me! Laugh at me, goddammit, laugh!"" His efforts to be funny seem so desperate and sweaty, yet for many people it works. For instance, the DVD for this movie includes an outtake where Carrey improvises with baking utensils. Director Tom Shadyac cites this as an example of Carrey's genius, but it reminded me of another exhausting comic, Carrot Top.",/review/rw5921181/?ref_=tt_urv

24 June 2003,XFLRWF,," God doth have a sense of humor
","Whether or not a person believes in God, most people have thought they could make things better if they ran the world.  Some would end world hunger, some would make world peace, and other would just fix the problems in their own lives.  But few people would ever consider the burden and awesome responsibility of the universe's most absolute power.  How would prayers be answered?  How would you handle disasters and riots?  What would you do if someone did not believe in you?  `Bruce Almighty' presents a view of what would happen if a man's will were done. Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a field reporter for the local Buffalo, NY news station.  Tired of doing human-interest stories, being passed over for promotions, and the overall course his life has taken, he calls out God (Morgan Freeman) and claims he can make things better if he ran the world. God hears Bruce's challenge and offers him the chance to prove it.  The Almighty departs for a vacation and endows Bruce with all his powers. Bruce now has the opportunity to demonstrate what kind of God he can be.  The only provisions are that Bruce cannot tell anyone he is God and he cannot interfere with anyone's free will. `Bruce Almighty' is wonderfully done by the talents of creative director Tom Shadyac (Liar, Liar, Patch Adams) and the humorous story by screenwriter Steve Koren (Night at the `Roxbury) and television writer Mark O'Keefe (Late Show with David Letterman).  Shadyac's direction plays a key role to this visually comedic movie.  Not solely relying on his performers, he also implements several sight gags.  Shadyac's eye for comedy comes through when he shows how Bruce organizes his prayer requests, how Bruce dispenses justice, and even when Bruce gets a cup of coffee. The script is also well written by the comedic duo of Koren and O'Keefe. The movie is not only funny but it also looks at the seriousness of what it really means to be God.  Koren and O'Keefe examine how would an average Joe handle the millions of daily prayer requests, would that person abuse his power, and would he ever give up the job.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a movie to would take your children to see to teach them religion.  It is filled with teen and adult humor that fans have come to expect from this genre.  Koren and O'Keefe not only manage to keep the theatre laughing but give God a human face. Jim Carrey gives another great performance as Bruce Nolan.  Known for his way out antics and facial expressions, Carrey combines those talents with a genuine acting ability that sells his performance.  Carrey is very much the common man in his role as Bruce.  He is frustrated with the morning traffic, he wants more in life, and he wants God to make it happen.  Most audiences can identify with his aggravation because most have been where Bruce has been.  But Carrey is also a hilarious man-God when he rules the world.  He has fun with his powers while making sure the best things work out for him. Carrey delivers just the right mix of comedy with a touch of the Spirit. Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston are also enjoyable in their roles as God and Bruce's girlfriend, Grace, respectively.  Freeman plays God with a humanistic yet sympathetic quality.  He not only offers Bruce the chance to take his job, but also is ready to help him out when he runs into trouble or needs advice.  Freeman's portrayal is also what one would expect out of God: warm, endearing, and forgiving.  Aniston's screen time is somewhat limited in the film.  Her performance of Grace is the typical stand-by-your-man girlfriend.  She loves Bruce and will stick with him no matter how much of a jerk he can be.  The role is generic but Aniston plays well with what she's dealt.  Perhaps the scene-stealer of the film is the sidesplitting job done by the Daily Show's Steve Carell.  Carell plays Bruce's main antagonist, Evan Baxter.  Baxter and Nolan's on-going feud sets the stage for very funny on-air showdown in which Carell's performance will have audiences wiping their eyes from laughter. `Bruce Almighty' is no doubt entertaining and humorous.  The movie has all the combinations to make it a success and audiences looking for a good laugh will not be disappointed.  While the movie may be more popular with the teen crowd, adults may also enjoy the film as well.  This is not a Jim Carrey comedy where he talks from his rear but a comedy that also examines a serious nature of life and show's Carrey has evolved as an actor.  But let us hope for Jim's case, God doth have a sense of humor.",/review/rw5921181/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2004,cherold,5," unrealized potential
","This movie really ought to have been funnier. It's not that it's a great premise - it's pretty daft, actually - but it's a workable premise. You've got Carrey with ultimate power, which offers all sorts of opportunities for humor. Yet the film rarely made it above mildly amusing and often couldn't even manage that. I think much of the problem was the movie was torn between wanting to be funny versus wanting to be touching and profound (since they throw in a scene from It's a Wonderful Life I tend to suspect they were hoping for something with that feel). The end result is a movie that fails to succeed comedically or emotionally. Bruce is not an especially sympathetic character, he's so petty and self centered that it's hard to take much of an interest in his problems or his life or his decisions. I thought Freeman made a pretty decent Lord Almighty and the bits with the dog were cute, and it wasn't so bad that I gave up on it, but it's really a movie where you just wonder, why did they even bother making this?",/review/rw5921181/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2008,kyle-cruse,7," Actually better than you might expect
","""Bruce Almighty"" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from the trailers. Nevertheless, I found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry at God and is given divine powers by him to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man symbolized here as God, and though it isn't his usual type of film or one of his best roles, he does excellent with what he is given to work with. Although crude at times, the film does have quite a few laughs, from Bruce parting his soup in half like the Red Sea and the customers' reactions to him, as well as Freeman's seemingly laid-back and wisecracking image of God. It is overly exaggerated at times, and there is some crude humor, but overall it manages to be somewhat funny. There is a decent supporting cast, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter, and Steve Carrell, which always helps. The end of the film proves to be very romantic and tear-jerking, and the message is clear, that we should do what God has called us to do and ""be the miracle."" The film is far from perfect, but still enjoyable, and far better than I and many people probably would have expected, especially if we see the deeper message of the film.",/review/rw5921181/?ref_=tt_urv

","Bruce almighty is just boring and bland. Jim Carrey isn't likable at all here, he is just boring and unfunny, I really did hate his character here. Morgan freeman was alright as God, he is good in theory as the almighty, but idk he was just a little blah, nothing too special. And then there's Jennifer Aniston, she was OK, I am an Aniston fan, but it's kinda hard to be a big fan of her in Bruce almighty, because like freeman, there just isn't much to her performance in the film. Also this movie is just hopelessly UNfunny, I mean I didn't even chuckle once during the entire film, and let me just tell ya, the movie is too long, the runtime is just simply too long. The movie should've been funnier, much funnier, especially since it stars comedic talent Jim Carrey, go figure. Bruce Almighty stoops to childish mediocre stunts to gain laughs, but fails miserably at it. Steve Carrel, another comedic talent, is in the movie, but he is a flop here as well. Boring, boring, and more boring. 1/10 for Bruce Almighty, just a flat out flop. Disappointing too, the movie had pretty good potential to be something funny, original, and intelligent. Maybe Evan almighty will be better, kinda doubt it though.",/review/rw5921181/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2019,TheHonestCritic,10," This is the best comedy movie in cinema, in my opinion. (Yet, it's so much more than just a comedy).
","""Bruce Almighty"" (2003), when I first watched this movie, it changed my outlook on the genre of comedy. It's yet another example of what I consider a perfect movie. ""Bruce Almighty"" also happens to be one of my top 10 all-time favorite movies! While ""The Three Stooges"" is my favorite comedy TV show and my all-time favorite TV show overall, ""Bruce Almighty"" is my favorite comedy movie. It's my favorite comedy film of all-time for one big reason; Jim Carrey. He makes this film, had this movie been cast with someone else as the character of Bruce Nolan, this movie might not have worked. Jim Carrey is not the only A-list comedy actor in this movie, Steve Carell; one of my other favorite comedy actors, is in this movie also. These two actors play off each other very well, put them both together and hilarity ensues! Before I saw this movie, I always wondered what it would be like if Jim Carrey and Steve Carrell were in a movie together. Sure enough, it works brilliantly and dreams really do come true! They may not be together during the whole movie, but when they do a comedy scene together it's comedic gold, and in this case less is more. Jennifer Aniston is great as Grace, the fiancee of Bruce. She and Jim Carrey have great chemistry in this movie! Also, they could not have picked a better actor to play God. If any actor could pull off that role, Morgan Freeman is definitely the best candidate for the part. This movie has a great story, great special effects, great sets/locations, great soundtrack, and of course great acting. It fires on all cylinders! As I mentioned, this movie is much more than just a comedy. It has a little bit of drama, a little bit of romance, and a touch of action to keep it interesting. I will not reveal the ending, truth be told, it's one of the best endings in cinema. You'll laugh and you'll cry when you see the ending, but I assure you that you're going to have tears of sadness, but also joy. If you're watching this movie for the first time, bring a box of tissues for the ending. Even though I've seen this movie countless times, I still get choked up watching the ending. This is Jim Carrey's best movie, bar-none. It expands on his true complexity as an actor, and it shows that he can do much more than just comedy. I can watch it 1,000 times in a row and laugh just as hard, if not harder, every single time I view it. Without question, I give it 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you have not seen ""Bruce Almighty"", what are you waiting for? I guarantee you that you'll laugh, and be moved like you've never been before in your life!",/review/rw5921181/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2021,mark.waltz,7," I don't want to even glimpse into my file cabinet.
","Probably my favorite actor to play God other than George Burns, Morgan Freeman with his delightful a commanding voice is perfect for the part, even better than the obvious choice, Charlton Heston in ""Almost an Angel"". Obviously, I'm going to take Hollywood's version of the Lord with a grain of salt, but I'm sure that the influence of Yahweh looked over the desk of whoever wrote this. For a Jim Carrey movie, it's very sweet and fulfilled with a lot of typical pratfalls, yet somehow, it's a life lesson spiritual comedy that entertains as well as it enlightens.",/review/rw5921181/?ref_=tt_urv
