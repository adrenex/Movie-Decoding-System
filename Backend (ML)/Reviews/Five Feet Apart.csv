3 December 2019,TheLittleSongbird,7," Troubles seemed far away after watching
","There were three main reasons really in seeing 'Yesterday'. The alternative world scenario sounded truly fascinating, one of the most fascinating concepts in recent years to me and a refreshing change from the remakes and sequels constantly made today. Like to love a lot of Danny Boyle's previous films and find him a talented director. The Beatles are not all time favourites but do appreciate him highly, understand their influence in music and like a lot of their songs a lot.",/review/rw5534358/?ref_=tt_urv

","What would you do, if something happened and seemingly everyone has no recollection of one of the best known groups ever? That would be the Beatles in that case, if you were wondering. And add to that that you would be a struggling musician - which would only add to the already quite high confusion.",/review/rw5534358/?ref_=tt_urv

","There are some movies that when released simply don't need a big marketing campaign. Just a few words of description of the plot are enough to put it on your ""must see"" list: ""A struggling musician has a cycling accident during a freak global blackout and wakes to a world where noone other than him remembers the Beatles or any of their songs."" When I heard this I said to myself ""yes, Yes, YES""! But would it live up to my expectations?",/review/rw5534358/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2019,Hitchcoc,9," Charmed by It
","I enjoyed this because I didn't think too much. If this were science fiction, which in some ways it was, and the Beatles never existed, how would so many things that were their legacy have developed. The British invasion would never have happened without them and a culture that expanded decades would never have taken place. But we can put that aside because the film tells us that the Beatles did not exist. Not that the four persons did not exist, but the band itself. I loved the bit with John Lennon where Mark David Chapman never came into his life. Anyway, it is a sappy love story in many ways, but the music is fun and the challenges of the protagonist are quite real in that milieu. I have been a huge fan of the Beatles from the get-go and if given a piece of paper and a pencil, could write the titles of a couple hundred songs. But to remember the lyrics, especially to a level of creative expertise, would be astonishing. Every once in a while something comes along that is just fun--no more criticism.",/review/rw5534358/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2021,boblipton,8," Do You Believe In Yesterday?
","It is a funny and heartfelt romantic comedy co-written by Richard Curtis and directed by Danny Boyle. Himesh Patel (in his feature debut) plays a rock guitarist on the point of giving up, getting ready to go back to teaching, despite the urging of his manager-roadie, Lily James, who has been in love with him since middle school, although he has never noticed. When she drops him off, he gets on his bike to pedal home, when suddenly the lights all over the world go out and he is struck by a bus. When he wakes, he discovers he is in a different world, where no one has ever heard of Coca-Cola or cigarettes.... or the Beatles. When he plays a Beatles song for his friends, they claim never to have heard of it before. He thinks they are joking, but as it dawns on him, he desperately writes all the Beatles songs, and is hailed as a great new talent, and taken under the agency of a Mephistophelean talent agent, played to glowering perfection by Kate McKinnon.",/review/rw5534358/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2019,matthewssilverhammer,4," What a waste of a great concept...
","Yesterday is pure cinematic fluff with a lightning-bolt of an idea. In moments, those substance-less joys earn their cuteness. But, as with writer Richard Curtis's other films (About Time), there's a unique ethical question underscoring the surface: what rights does an artist have over a creation they didn't create? Should we be honest about ""reality"" when that reality isn't reality? Confused? Don't worry; that complexity is all but completely brushed under the rug here, opting instead for cheap explanations and corny romance.
Because of unimportant and uninteresting reasons, an aspiring musician (Patel) discovers he is the only person in the world who remembers The Beatles. Patel is great in the lead; with impeccable timing and effortless charm, he manages to steal all these classic songs without losing our sympathy. He's supported by a handful of genuinely funny and sweet moments: jokes at the expense of Oasis and Ed Sheeran, the reveals of other erased cultural touchstones (Coca-Cola, Harry Potter, etc), even a surprisingly moving reveal of others who remember the past. Unfortunately, the story doesn't do much to help. Lazy storytelling shortcuts are taken at every turn, making a fantastical concept even more difficult to believe.
Curtis is usually quite adept with this type of rom-dramedy, but he's not at the helm here. Boyle is, and he's known for his hyper-stylized direction, which proves problematic. Where he spends time working on montages of ridiculous metaphorical storytelling devices, he should be fleshing out character motivations and ethical conundrums. Yesterday makes me glad we live in a reality with The Beatles, so we can ignore this movie and stay home to listen to Abbey Road.",/review/rw5534358/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2021,iwalrus,8," Enjoyable
","A little predictable but an enjoyable movie.
A novel way to look at and appreciate music from The Beatles through modern eyes.
Himesh Patel was a great choice for the main character, his acting and singing were excellent.
Nice to see Ed Sheeran not being afraid to make light of fame, given me a new respect for him.
I do feel that the concept could have gone just a little further but nevertheless, still a fun way to spend a couple of hours",/review/rw5534358/?ref_=tt_urv

","I went into this wondering if they were going to explain the whole premise with it being a dream or such? Was he going to get caught and crucified for it? Was he going to get the girl, lose the girl? So many movies are fixated on realism and difficulties and negativity. Yes, he faces several difficulties. But, the movie is light and beautiful with fantastic music. If I want realism, I watch a documentary. This is what I go to the movies for. Really well done!",/review/rw5534358/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2019,naveen64,7," An original homage that helps break the current biopic trend
","After being subjected to a number of films documenting the lives of musicians - most notably ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Rocketman"" and ""Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story"" - it is truly a pleasure to be presented with a film that sheds light on the work and life of an artist while not adhering to the strict (though desirable) biographical approach. That is exactly what makes the piece so marvellous; I came out of the cinema with a greater appreciation of The Beatles, and their music, through a fictional story that did not feature the four men we are familiar with at all. Quite often the film achieved my admiration for the band without me consciously noticing.",/review/rw5534358/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2021,jamesrupert2014,8," Frothy musical fantasy
","Jack Malik (Himesh Patel), an aspiring musician, awakens to a world in which 'The Beatles' (amongst other things) never existed, allowing him to take sole credit for one of the greatest collections of popular music ever written, although not without feeling a bit guilty. The film does a lot with the slim, high-concept premise and the musical segments are great. Patel and Lily James (as girlfriend Ellie) are excellent, as are the rest of the cast, especially musician Ed Sheeran and Kate McKinnon, who amusingly hams up predatory music promotor Debra Hammer. Not surprisingly, the film is full of both overt and subtle nods to 'The Fab Four' and is perfect for anyone who has ever daydreamed about an alternate reality in which they pen an iconic tune (my song of choice is 'Bridge over Troubled Water'). Good, lightweight fun.",/review/rw5534358/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2019,krazy-mm,8," Feel-good movie and a real crowd pleaser. I love it!
","Saw it at my cinema in Lovran, Croatia just a few hours ago, so it's still pretty ""fresh"" while I'm writing this.
The whole idea is great, haven't seen those yet in mainstream cinema. The plot is pretty much straight-forward, with likeable characters, great music (of course) and when the movie was over, it left me with good feeling and a smile on my face still singing Hey Jude.",/review/rw5534358/?ref_=tt_urv

","Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) is a struggling singer-songwriter in Suffolk, England. He is a ""complete failure"". His only fans seems to be his friends especially his lifelong best friend Ellie Appleton (Lily James). She has an unrequited love for him. One night, the lights go out and he gets hit by a bus. He wakes up to discover that The Beatles never existed. There are other surprising changes like the lost of Coke and Wonderwall. Jack tries to remake the Beatles songs with mixed results until he is contacted by Ed Sheeran who wants him as his opening act.

13 July 2019,leobryan-03453,6," Interesting concept. Awkward execution.
","It was a great idea and in some ways the film made the vision work. I just don't think they did enough with it though and instead fell back into the traditional love story formula. The music helped carry a lot of it through (unsurprisingly). What they missed was it wasn't necessarily the songs themselves but the era in which they came out and the meaning of the time. Movie just presented it as almost instant stardom if today's world heard the songs which lets be honest today's generation wouldn't understand half of it. It didn't really present a clear vision of ""why"" which I was looking for towards the end to help tie things up. Lights go off on the planet he takes a bump on the head then the Beatles never existed? Alternate universe? Dream? Thought there would've been something more there. There were a few things that bothered me with the story that the movie made it seem like they were pieces to the puzzle but then never did anything with them. First is through the film he also finds out other things don't exist as well such as coke, cigarettes, the band oasis, and Harry Potter. It seemed like these things were going to connect into the story and why the Beatles music isn't present but they just left it there and he kind of says ""oh well"" and nothing comes of it. The second was he finds out there are two others that also know the Beatles music and again seems like this should be a big part of the story to tie things together as to a bit of ""why"" but they just have a conversation about it she gives him an address and then that's it. His conversation with what I think is supposed to be John Lennon didn't make sense either. Does that mean the other 4 exist? Did they never meet to make music? Just all added up to a great idea that worked early in the film but didn't follow through properly. All my opinion of course",/review/rw5534358/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2019,Pairic,9," Great Universe Slip Story
","Yesterday: A struggling singer/songwriter Jack (Himesh Patel) is transported into a parallel universe where The Beatles don't exist. The transport McGuffin is well handled: a global power outage during which the cycling Jack is struck by a bus. Waking up in hospital he is comforted by his roadie/manager/agent Ellie (Lily James), there is unrequited love between them which is central to the film's narrative. Jack first realises something is odd when he discovers that none of his friends recognise the song Yesterday. This scene is beautifully shot at a riverside location with a setting sun capturing the mood of the song. Going online he finds no mention of The Beatles, this universe has a good side as well though: there is also no Oasis (it also lacks a few other things).",/review/rw5534358/?ref_=tt_urv

29 April 2021,criscal,9," Awesome homage to the Beatles
","The premise of the movie is this fun idea, that somebody wakes up as the only guy knowing about the Beatles and their songs and that he gets the idea to hand them out as his own songs. So the movie imagines the impact on modern music, if it was fresh music with some caricarture of modern music industry - the presentation for the album cover was really funny. I really liked the idea that an old John Lennon gives the main character life advice.",/review/rw5534358/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2019,myshelledavies,8," Refreshing
","I liked it. It was a refreshing change from the blockbuster superhero genre that is choking society.
Jack's struggle with the dishonesty was obvious throughout the film. The music was superb. Ed Sheeran's portrayal of himself was super cute.
I was a little worried the writer would take it over the top and Ed would decide Jack was better than he and decide to stop making music. I am very glad they didn't go there with the story.
Jack coming clean near the end and the way he did it, was a good ending for me.
Also the fact that The Beatles were not the only thing/person to disappear during the blackout was a fun touch.
All in all, It was an emotional, fun, twist of a movie.",/review/rw5534358/?ref_=tt_urv
