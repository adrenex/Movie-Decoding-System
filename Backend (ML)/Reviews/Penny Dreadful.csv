4 November 2017,classicsoncall,10," ""The devil you know is better than the devil you don't.""
","There aren't many fight movies I'd rate as high as a '10', and by fight movies I'm talking about boxing as the subject. ""Rocky"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" are the only two I can think of off hand. But this movie transcends the genre and is so much more than a film about a pair of brothers reaching for the gold ring in the arena of mixed martial arts. There's a lot of human drama on display, and the three principals in the story pull off some of the most incredible performances one is likely to see in a film like this.",/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2020,ansharora-12638,9," Joel and Tom are magical.
","At first, I thought, ""man, should have shown a little more backstory, why so much hate among the family and whatever"". But then I understood, that would have made it just another family drama movie, which it cannot be. This movie is about the raw unsaid emotion of a family that always remains there. No matter what.",/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2020,Vuraxis,9," Oh my god
","I'm hard to break when it comes to emotions. I've seen a lot of the best emotional films. Schindler's List, Forrest Gump, Grave of the Fireflies, Requiem for a Dream, The Green Mile, It's a Wonderful Life, and most recently I Lost my Body. But this is the one that finally cracked me, and for the first time in my life, I've cried to a movie. I don't even like sports, but the sheer intensity and stress I felt in the fight scenes is overwhelming.",/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2021,severindringel,10," A powerful masterpiece about desperate men
","Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton feud as estranged brothers at the Pentagon. Nick Nolte plays a rehabilitating father with deep-seated demons. From these dynamics emerges a family drama that on the surface dances to the usual Rocky schema - but again, not at all. Warrior is, in fact, a very special sports film. Not just because of its specific sport (MMA is unlikely to play a role on the big screen anytime soon), but the storytelling of how director Gavin O'Connor manages to weave together the emotional facets of this masculine world.",/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2011,neji107,9," Emotions on par with The Fighter, one of the top combat sport movies since Rocky, one of the best of 2011
","Every so often you'll come across a combat sport movie that manages to find just the right balance of drama and action – that is, more drama than action. When fights are justified with backstories full of crushing emotion, they become all the more intense and gratifying. ",/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv

",Tommy (Tom Hardy) becomes an internet sensation as a MMA fighter. He is estranged from his father Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) who is a recovering alcoholic. His older brother Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) is a teacher struggling to make ends meet for his wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison) and their two girls.,/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2011,jon.h.ochiai,10," What You Fight For
","""Warrior"" may be one of the best movies of the year that no one sees. That in itself is puzzling. Mixed martial arts and UFC are in the cultural mainstream; in fact MMA is more popular than professional boxing. Director and writer Gavin O'Connor did the amazing ""Miracle"" a few years back about the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team. So he has the touch for inspirational sports stories. In ""Warrior"" estranged brothers Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) and Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) fight each other in the finals of the winner take all mixed martial arts tournament Sparta in Atlantic City. ""Warrior"" is an inspired story of family, honor, and redemption. I applauded at the end of the movie along with the rest of the audience.",/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2016,CANpatbuck3664,10," The Excellent MMA Fights Aren't The Primary Reason To Watch This Movie, The Powerful Acting Is
","I'm a little late getting this review up, the movie has been out since 2011. I'm putting up this review so far past it's release because this might be the best movie I've seen that's come out in this decade.I still remember walking into the theatre being open but having low expectations, with no idea such a skillfully made and emotionally gripping movie lay ahead.",/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2020,MrSelfPaid,10," One of the few movies that made me shed a few tears.
","Watching this movie from my perspective, made me shed a few tears. For someone like me who has a younger brother that I always look after, I reacted to every scene as if it was parallel to my life.",/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," One of the best of the year
","I love movies of all kinds regardless of their age. 2011 so far has been a very hit-and-miss year, luckily alongside Drive and The Tree of Life(though both won't appeal to all) Warrior is among my favourites of this year.",/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2020,Floated2,9," More than just a fighting film
","Quite a compelling and interesting story unfolded with the main topic of mma fighting in ""Warrior"". Lead by a great cast and great acting from its leads, this film is quite a step above simply a fighting film. There is more depth than expected as it has a great buildup to its characters- and they seem like real people rather than just one dimensional caricatures.",/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2014,kosmasp,9," Fighting
","A movie called Warrior, well you know where this is heading. Even if there is also a philosophical side to the title (a more spiritual one so to speak). Tom Hardy got a lot of recognition for this, but Nick Nolte and our other main character are as good in this. We have two people who will engage each other, having a common issue. It's not a spoiler to write it, you'll find out soon enough (or guess it), but I'll let you do that for yourself.",/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2019,mattyt_tmf,10," One of the most heart-breaking, emotional films I have ever seen.
","It's really hard to start with this movie. It basically covers two estranged brothers - One who has embraced a quiet, family life; the other, dedicated his time to the United States military. Through a series of events, they come in contact with each other again during a MMA tournament. Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton capture the hearts of the fans with their emotional, tear-wrenching performances, with Nick Nolte as their father delivering the most emotional performance of them all. With the film being a MMA movie, it's strange to think that drama would be so prevalent but essentially it is the backbone of the story.",/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2017,zkonedog,8," A New Fight Movie For A New Fight Generation
","Over the years, the sport of boxing has provided film-goers with undeniably great films like ""Rocky"", ""The Champ"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", and ""The Fighter"". In today's culture, though, boxing has largely been replaced by mixed martial arts as the fight game of choice. This was never more apparent than in the early 2010s when this film was released. While ""Warrior"" is by no means a perfect film, it easily does enough to speak to this new culture of combat films.",/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2021,BrnzReviews,10," A Great Take On Rivalry, Family & Pride!
","Being a huge MMA fan i knew this movie was going to be good, I'm also a massive fan of Tom Hardy too so it's a win win. The movie was great, story held up and really felt engaging the entire way through, i liked the way the movie was made where we switch between each character, it really helps the character development get underway and this movie excells in that aspect, along with being one of the best fighter movies I've seen in this day and age.",/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2011,nyharlemeve,," A wonderfully, well written story
","This movie is truly, truly OUTSTANDING! I am in complete shock over the performances in this film. Nick Nolte, as usual, gives a gritty, gut wrenching, emotional performance that left me buckling at the knees. One of my all time favorite movies of Mr. Nolte was Rich Man, Poor Man, absolutely a god given talent! The performances of Mr. Hardy and Mr. Edgeron were academy award winning, I would love to see more of them by far! I cried throughout the movie, and when it was over, I could not wait to tell everyone about it. A terrific ensemble cast and movie that certainly should be up for Best Picture!! A definitive Oscar nod for Nick Nolte, and if it were up to me, Mr. Hardy and Mr. Edgeron would walk away with one as well! If you have not seen this movie, drop what you are doing, run to your nearest theater. This movie is truly what being a performer is all about! My hat is off to you all!!!",/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2012,siderite,9," Emotional, long, but very good sports drama
","Who will win the fight? Bane or the guy who fought The Thing? Seriously now, the acting in this movie was way above the genre of this film. I know it was a sports fighting movie and I expected things on par with van Damme Asian tournament films. Boy, was I wrong!",/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2012,zetes,6," Clichéd sports movie with some good points
","A very cliché sports story, with so many corny moments that you'll have seen in six dozen other films that it becomes ludicrous long before its end. Yet, in some ways, it's pretty well done, and it nearly overcomes those clichés. Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy play two brothers who parted ways way back when they were teenagers. Hardy went away with his mother and later joined the Marines after she passed away. Now he has returned to his father (Nick Nolte), a former drunk who drove his family apart. Edgerton didn't like his father much, either, but chose not to go with his brother and mother because he was in love with the woman he would eventually marry (Jennifer Morrison). Both brothers are skilled fighters and have their eyes set on the big prize in a mixed martial arts tournament. The film somewhat succeeds because it's very low-key. Most of the time, it's hard to notice how melodramatic and predictable the story is. The performances help, too (Joel Edgerton was my favorite of the three big characters). After a while, though, we get stuff like a wife who refuses to watch the fight impatiently pacing behind her cell phone, on a table in the foreground, waiting for a call to tell her her husband has won a match. And Hardy's story is beyond ridiculous - he gets invited to the tournament after beating up a trained MMA champion in a local gym - never mind that Hardy, at best, was just a trained wrestler many years ago in high school. Being in the Marines does not give you superpowers. That's just the start of the ridiculousness that ends up, obviously, with the two brothers fighting in the ring (with Edgerton's wife, at this point, of course watching from ringside). I should probably call Gavin O'Connor one of the best directors of the year, because, as over-the-top as all this stuff is (and, believe me, I barely scratched the surface - the movie runs for 2 hours and 20 minutes), it generally doesn't feel that way. If one doesn't look too closely at it, I could imagine it seeming great. But it's not.",/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2020,filmreviewer123,10," 10/10 I can't get over how good this film was.

29 August 2020,pgregory_photo,10," What a movie ignore the title it's deceiving and the fact it has MMA in this movie is so much more
","I remember when this movie came out and I didn't bother with it as it sounded like a action MMA testeroned filled hour plus I didn't want to waste. If that's your kind of movie you won't like this, but if you like films like Rocky, the fighter, films that martial arts are apart of the main theme. You will love this.",/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2011,cervantese,10," Loved IT!
","I had the pleasure of watching this movie last night. I went since its a ""guy"" movie my husband was the one excited about it more than I was. I must say I was more than impressed with the leading men in this film. It has been a long time since a movie has had me on the edge of my seat, biting my nails as this movie did during the fighting scenes. If you are looking for great acting, family drama, awesome fighting scenes than this is the movie for you. After we left the theater we couldn't stop talking about it. I will definitely go see it again when it comes out. We really enjoyed it! Nick Nolte was amazing, and even my husband I think cried in a few scenes, (last time that happened was during Marley and Me) so I must say this movie is a MUST SEE!",/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2020,andrewchristianjr,10," MORE THAN ACTION AND FIGHTING.
",To this day this is one of my favorite movies. It's not because of the action and fighting. It is so much more than that. It is one of the few movies I have seen that take you on a complete emotional rollercoaster. Yes Testosterone filled but also touching and family based.,/review/rw5581782/?ref_=tt_urv
