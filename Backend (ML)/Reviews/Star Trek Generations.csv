23 October 2014,utgard14,4," Poor Sequel
","Sin City was one of my favorite movies of the 2000s. A fun, creative film noir cartoon with unique visuals and a style all its own. The first problem you run into with this sequel is that it offers nothing new. It's a stylistic retread of the first movie, only less impressive. The visuals copy the first movie but somehow seem cheaper. The makeup effects aren't as good either, with Marv's jaw easily twice the size of the last movie. The action is weaker, with no memorable sequences and a final showdown that is derivative of the first movie. The other big problem is that the writing is very poor this time and the stories don't flow well together. The Dwight story is lame. The Johnny story is pointless. The Nancy story is impossible to take seriously, especially the ghost parts. Sadly, this movie is boring, listless, and disjointed. It's a movie that didn't need to be made. Still, it's always nice to see Eva Green naked. That's something that never gets old.",/review/rw3075793/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2022,Coventry,8," Sin City remains a cult-movie to die for
","To me - but, of course, I'm no Roger Ebert - the original ""Sin City"" belongs in the top three of greatest movies since the new Millennium. In between all the lame and goody-two-shoes adaptations of Marvel and DC comic books, the collaboration between artist Frank Miller and cult-director Robert Rodriguez stood out as unique, innovative, and immensely entertaining. Bizarrely enough, it took these same two genius men almost a decade to come up with the sequel, but it was worth the wait. Obviously, the element of surprise is gone, but all the rock-solid trademarks still stand.",/review/rw3075793/?ref_=tt_urv

17 April 2015,Vartiainen,7," Unfortunately they used all the best stories in the first one
","Sin City: A Dame to Kill For is not a bad idea on paper. Frank Miller's Sin City universe is a rich and interesting setting, and as the first Sin City film proved, it translates to the silver screen beautifully. Unfortunately they decided to stick all the best stories into the first film, thus guaranteeing its success, but leaving the possible sequel without much material to use. Not that the stories used here are bad, they're just not as great as the ones used in the first one. Tellingly Miller was actually called back to write two new stories exclusively for the film. It shows.",/review/rw3075793/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2014,Rickting,6," Sin City 2 lacks punch but still offers gritty, visually stunning comic book fun
","After 9 years Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller finally made a sequel to their masterpiece from 2005, Sin City, and.... no-one went to see it. One of 2014's biggest and definitely the most surprising box office bomb, critics were also fairly unkind to the film. It's not as bad as some say it is, but it's best summed up as this: The Kick-Ass 2 of 2014. An enjoyable sequel which lacks the original's impact and misses the point, and struggles to hit a peak when the scene stealer from the first is off screen. In Sin City: A Dame To Kill For, we return to the nastiest, darkest and grittiest city in comic book movies for more brutal stories of justice, sin and moral corruption. In one Marv becomes an amnesiac, in another a cocky gambler finds himself in trouble when he beats the wrong man at poker, in another Nancy Callahan takes revenge on the man who caused the death of John Hartigan and another involves Dwight's encounter with a mysterious femme fatale played by Eva Green. What's noticeable about these stories? They emphasize action and that wasn't the point of the first.",/review/rw3075793/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2014,Frogfisher,7," Good and entertaining... but lacks the novelty of the first.
","A Dame to Kill for is by no means a boring or bad film. It succeeds as a satisfying sequel to the far more novel and perhaps stronger Sin City... it is bloody, violent, beautifully made, with cool deep voices, nudity and clearly fitting into the film noir genre. Where it falls short is in the charactersationssliding a bit, the strength of two original stories, the change in actors and the gap between the first and second film. There is also a desperate need for more iconic moments which the Sin City comics and the film has plenty of, but they never really come in A Dame to Kill for. ",/review/rw3075793/?ref_=tt_urv

","Marv (Mickey Rourke) is unconscious on a highway surrounded by corpses. When he awakes, he has amnesia and tries to recall his last steps from the Kadie's saloon on the Saturday night.

","I'm a big fan of Frank Miller's work, and ""Sin City"" (2005) and ""300"" (2006) are two of my favorite films. But just as the sequel ""300 Rise of an Empire"" disappointed, this sequel is not up to the original. In fact, it is so far from the original it's disturbing. There is nothing new here, and much of what made the original entertaining is missing as well. More problematic, everyone's voice seems the same.",/review/rw3075793/?ref_=tt_urv

","SIN CITY: A DAME TO KILL FOR (2014) ***1/2 Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Josh Brolin, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Rosario Dawson, Bruce Willis, Eva Green, Powers Boothe, Dennis Haysbert, Ray Liotta, Christopher Meloni, Jeremy Piven, Christopher Lloyd, Jaime King, Juno Temple, Stacy Keach, Marton Csokas, Jude Cicolella, Jamie Chung, Julia Garner, Lady Gaga. Slam-bang sequel to the mash-up of dynamic duo filmmaker Robert Rodriguez and graphic novelist Frank Miller's collaboration in adapting the latter's cult comic book to the big screen (again) with some new faces (hello Gordon-Levitt as a charming lucky/unlucky gambler) and old (good ol' Rourke as the hulking pugilist avenging Marv) in the seedy titular town of trouble. All sorts of crimes are boiling to a full roil including Brolin's Dwight (replacing Clive Owen) returning for some revenge from femme fatale Green (ethereally lethal) and stripper Alba wanting payback for the suicide of her beloved Willis (brooding in spirit). Gruesome violence, duplicitous women and vice to spare, the film runs on full-tilt, high octane brio with the invaluable skills of Rodriguez (who shot/cut and photographed the sleekly gorgeous black and white with slashes of vibrant color) that only falters in going by too fast to savor the sordid proceedings at hand.",/review/rw3075793/?ref_=tt_urv

","Nine years is a long time to wait for a sequel, but in the case of Frank Miller's 'Sin City: A Dame to Kill For', it's as if it was just yesterday. Yes, fans will be glad to know that the years since have not dulled the sensibilities of Miller or his co-director Robert Rodriguez, both of whom have returned to script and helm this faithful sequel - and by faithful, we mean that it is just as hard-boiled, gory, garish and violent. In short, if you did not like the first one, then there's no reason you should bother with this.",/review/rw3075793/?ref_=tt_urv

15 November 2014,nagybalu,4," Bland.
","I'd like to begin by saying the original 2005 Sin City is one of my favorite movies. The way it was put together, the cinematography, the characters, the dialogue...everything. It was truly a breakthrough film. This sequel however is a letdown. It's not the type of letdown where the product can't match the hype, it's just everything I enjoyed about the first movie turned over. Yes, A Dame to Kill For is still broken into chapters and shot in B/W with occasions flashes of color, and I loved the allusions to the previous film and comic books- however, in contrast to the rich character depth and storyline, the storyline(s) is flat, bland, and lacks the energy the dialogue contained in the previous film. Also, the storyline isn't remotely as interwoven as it was in the previous, the directors struggled to keep the chapters intertwined-the *only* connection being Kadie's Bar, which all of the characters visited at least once. I appreciated that Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller attempted to bring humor into the mix, but Marv's second, ""I hope you don't mind me saying this...."" scene really doesn't belong in the movie.

26 August 2014,Red-Barracuda,8," Weaker than the first movie for sure but still a seductive experience
","From the outset it has to be admitted that it really has taken far too long for this follow up sequel to the original Sin City to happen. I don't really know why it has taken the best part of a decade but, whatever the reason, it's rather unfortunate. It seems to have affected the commercial performance of the sequel, in that the memory of the first has faded somewhat in the collective mind of the fickle cinema-going audience. Still, good things come to those who wait, right? Well, in this case, yes and no. This film does pale quite definitely when set alongside the original. The chief problem is that the three intertwining stories are definitely lacking somewhat, which is especially baffling when you consider there has been so many years between the movies. You would have thought creator Frank Miller would have come up with stories with more oomph to them. Where the vignettes in the first film were fairly basic, they all had unusual angles to them; the equivalents in Sin City: A Dame to Kill For have really no mysterious quirks to enliven them, they even seem quite pointless and repetitive at times. In addition, several characters have been brought back but in some cases their presence is entirely negligible (Hartigan) or poorly replaced by a new actor (Dwight); the whole idea is surely that this is a franchise based around a place not specific characters and this would have been a great opportunity to introduce some fresh, new ones.",/review/rw3075793/?ref_=tt_urv
