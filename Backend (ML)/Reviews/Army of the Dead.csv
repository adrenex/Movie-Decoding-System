3 September 2022,samekhproductions,10," Brilliant remake of a classic!
","I know many were/are skeptical about this. But it is amazing! It is worth it! It's not just a dumb cash grab. There are very noticeable improvements. The graphics of course is the first noticeable difference between this and the original. Gameplay, cinematics, upgrades, and photo mode have improved. You can unlock new weapon and character skins. The customization and accessibility is wild. The animation has such greater details. The dust in the environment. The bugs crawling in nasty places. Tears in people's eyes. The greater emotions in their faces. Rain dripping off characters and items. Absolutely astonishing. The upgrading weapons animation is a wonderful addition. Of course, all of this is (plus more) is done without changing a single thing with the story. The story stays true to the original. The only thing that is kind of a bummer is that they didn't put the dodging in here. I totally understand why they didn't add prone or jump, because it really wasn't needed. But dodging would have been very useful. But it's not really that big of a deal. This would definitely be a great way to revisit the absolute masterpiece or to play it for the first time. And considering it will be released on PC soon, more gamers can enjoy this work of art.",/review/rw8692963/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,DaGhoulJones,10," I didn't think you can improve upon perfection but I was wrong.
","Ok so this is interesting because I was very hesitant towards the idea of a remake of The Last Of Us. The original game only came out in 2013. Less than 10 years ago so it just seemed unnecessary to me. When the game released I was shocked to see the reception to it was actually quite good so I decided to try it for myself and honestly I am not disappointed, this game looks and plays phenomenally. I can't get over big of a graphical overhaul this game was it looks absolutely gorgeous, it is easily one of the best looking games I've played and the gameplay is quite a bit smoother than it was in the original. The enemy AI is also greatly improved and adds a bit more of an extra challenge to the game. Overall I'm very impressed with this and for me personally as such a big fan of the original game, it is definitely worth Â£70.",/review/rw8692963/?ref_=tt_urv

6 September 2022,jamesstark-14119,10," Beautiful
","The same amazing game we all love now with much improved graphics the fact that the creators manage to get your emotions going in the first 20 minutes of the game with the death of sarah and seeing the loss that joel experienced and watching him slowly warm up to Ellie is beautiful. No game will ever too it in my opinion. The perfect game and an absolute masterpiece. Even the side story ""Left Behind"" is a great side story it fills in a gap and answers many questions that were left open throughout the main story. Seeing how Ellie became infected And seeing how she treated Joel is great along with seeing what Ellie was doing before she met Joel.",/review/rw8692963/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2022,khasrawbaraki,10," Speechless (about this masterpiece)
",My The last of us review I'm so overwhelmed by this game right now. This game is like a delicious meal. When it ends you want so bad to have more of it but in some other way you are the most satisfied human being. The graphics are so amazing I can't even digest it. The story is so well done that I was left teary. And thinking about the ending is surprisingly just as deep as analyzing a good movie. I'm gonna talk about the ending later. This game tells the story of a man with a mission. He has to go across a post-apocalyptic america to deliver a little girl to a rebel group of survivors. As I came aware that it was involved a rebel group holding against the government I was worried. I said to myself oh this is so cliche but I was wrong. And i have to mention this was just a meaningless worry still having in my mind the Amazing prologue that I just witnessed. The setting the gameplay and the execution of what envelopes is superb in the prologue and in the whole game in general. The game is divided by season (I know it's weird but awesome). And every season ends with something big.i think might be winder but it's hard to pick one because they all are amazing but I'm just gonna go with winter now. The pacing and the way they are and experienced are awesome. Now what most gamers were worried about the gameplay. Let me say this. This game has the most fluid and satisfying gameplay that I have ever experienced. The way the gameplay combines with the atmosphere and story is done masterfully. It hes a level of intensity to it that hits you right in the brain's sweet spot. You have to carefully walk through dark hallways and smartly plan.,/review/rw8692963/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,joel_warnes,10," Never ceases to amaze me
","This is a beautiful adaptation of a classic video game. Ellie and Joel have never looked so realistic, along with the other characters like Henry, Sam, Tess, Bill and David. A very good connection to Part II's engine. Photo mode is great and even the collectibles are worth purchasing just for that. Well done Naughty Dog for your fabulous creation brought back to life again. Even though the original is only ten years old it has unfortunately aged a little bit and this in my opinion is well needed. Especially for those who missed the opportunity of playing it first hand. The game deserves so much credit and this will be worth playing.",/review/rw8692963/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2022,mitxhq,10," 11/10 absolute masterpiece!
","From the moment this game starts within the first 5 minutes all hell has broke loose and it already has your full attention. From beginning to end it consistently keeps you on your toes and you never know what's about to happen next! Everything in this game feels so immersive from the movement to the guns, dialogue and most importantly the environment!",/review/rw8692963/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2022,tesseractzv,10," Amazing Remake!!
","This was such a good remake with extraordinary graphic improvements! Joel and Ellie's design for this remake look so much better and realistic compared to the original one. I cant express enough how much I love this game and the fact that we got a remake for it really makes me happy. Tess looks much better as well, so does David and Bill. Man, I love this game so much!!",/review/rw8692963/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2022,kevinmartell-99554,9," A Landmark Experience with Impressive Visual Upgrades
","There are few video games as beloved or important as The Last of Us. Originally released in 2013, the game was a landmark for the medium because of how cinematic, grounded, and story driven it was. While far from the first game to utilize motion capture technology, it was the first game to implement it in such a way that you could tell actors were giving collaborative, deep, heartfelt performances on screen for extended periods of time. The realism of the cinematics opened the door for The Last of Us to challenge contemporary criticisms about video games - Those who claimed that games could never reach the heights of films were suddenly faced with a game that looked and felt just like a film. Now, almost a decade later, the game has been remade as The Last of Us Part I for the PS5.",/review/rw8692963/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2022,mertafor,7," A remake full of issues
","This is a horrible remake. I don't know how come no one mentioned that but there are so many bugs and inconsistencies, it's difficult to keep playing. I purchased the game on Black Friday, that being said I haven't played initial release and expected these issues have been addressed already.",/review/rw8692963/?ref_=tt_urv
