","If you've seen the previous movies, you know what's up. And you'll know the characters and you'll get the jokes you expect this to make. And you get a bonus love story on top of that. Now you don't have to have seen the other movies to ""enjoy"" this. Actually especially young kids who watch this may not have been born when the others were released.",/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv

9 July 2018,rannynm,8," Entertaining family film with distinctive animation style and wonderful voice acting
",Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation is an entertaining animated film filled with unique creativity. Wonderful voice acting and a distinctive animation style separate this from the majority of animated films. This is sure to be a worthwhile watch for all families.,/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2018,abcvision,10," Love
","The monsters are back. This time the patriarch Count Dracula is seeking love and companionship. He is lonely. After unsuccessful attempt in seeking a partner on the inter web he discovers a love interest in the beautiful Captain of a holiday cruise ship. A love tale of hope and love, this sweet story showcases how life is too short, even if you have eternal life and to live alone in a sea of strangers. I loved it and it made me believe in happily ever after regardless if things work out as planned. Dr Wilson Trivi√±o",/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2018,maurodc,10," The best of the franchise
","Hotel Transylvania is not one of my favorite animated sagas and the first two were funny and entertaining, but completely average. And my expectations for this one weren't too high.",/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2018,TheLittleSongbird,7," A monstrously fun vacation
","The first 'Hotel Transylvania' was surprisingly good, after expecting to dislike it. The second film garnered mixed reviews, though a fair few of them had been negative, some thought it was great fun while others disliked it intensely. Personally am in the former.",/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2019,Lost_In_Translation_,5," Mindless entry in normally entertaining cartoon series.
",The first two movies are extremely fun and well made cartoon movies. They have the feel of a silly Saturday morning cartoon with some of the most quirky animation in modern movies. They also had some heart and a really interesting stories.,/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2018,ericstevenson,8," Why the lower rating?
","This website seems to think the movies got worse as they went on, while RottenTomatoes thinks the opposite. I'm going with RottenTomatoes on this one. The advertisements made it look like it took place at the beach, when the beach barely appears at all. The basic plot is that Dracula and the monsters are going on a vacation on a cruise. This film probably only works so well because of Ericka. This has got to be one of the funniest characters I've seen in awhile.",/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2018,lorna-adair-133-801166,9," Still funny
","After three films you expect the laughs to stop with this franchise. Totally wrong, plenty of laughs in this film and plenty to have in the future.
The true stars of the film are the Wayne and his family, they just are so funny, the childcare scene is the best and the line about being lock up for two week tranquillised is so so funny. Family film that keeps giving.",/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2018,ShelbyTMItchell,9," Need a Good Laugh After Seeing This
","Dracula that has shown to be a provider and protector of people of his kind from werewolves, mummies, etc. As you will get a bit of back history as why he opened his hotel and why he has not remarried.",/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2018,zeenahspirit,10," Fun for whole family
",I loved this film. It's funny and creative. Kept my daughter (9.5) captivated. She just had to call Grandma afterward to tell her all about it.,/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2018,Fun1988,9," Total fun for all!!!!
","Hotel Transylvania 3 is a delight! If you're a fan, you will love it. Humor is spot on and Adam Sandler created a movie with a fun feel. Must see!",/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2018,Zingbot_9000,3," Disappointed
",No where near as good as the first two movies. You've seen the ads you've seen the movie. As Drac would say other than Drac the other characters are blah. On top that saw it in 3D and there were zero 3D effects. Felt they phoned it in on this one. Also upset cuz we saw this over Ant-man. Mediocre as they come.,/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2019,iguth,4," Could've been better
","The third in the series serves as more of a series of tales as opposed to a movie. There is not really a great plot, although there is a fine one, the appeal however comes from the humor and visual gags throughout the film. The target audience is obviously a very young demographic but even past that I would expect a more meaningful plot hidden behind the humor. There is nothing new really introduced and the character development of Dracula is weak. Overall I would have expected a little more from the series.",/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2018,Bulldog1721,9," Drac Pack at sea... Pretty good but something more than a trip
",Hotel Transylavania has been one of my favorite franchises to come out of Hollywood since Toy Story. The way this third one is done can really be summarized in two words.. LOVE BOAT,/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2018,jpalsemail,9," A fun, harmless movie
","I'm surprised to see negative reviews (and I'm a pretty critical person). I thought it was fun for both my son and myself. There wasn't any humor or plot line I worried about as a parent, it was fun to watch, engaging, the humor made both of us laugh and I just love the characters. There were some moments that particularly cracked me up. It was a great time and a nice way to spend 90 minutes with my family.",/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2019,hsp-54868,5," Dissapointing.
","Me and my family saw this film last year and we went with a couple of friends. I then thought that since I was getting old, I had lost interest in these types of films. First off, the animation was WAY too fast paced and over the top, which was hard for me to like the movie. Second, there are a few toilet jokes which made me facepalm, like when Erica puts garlic sauce in the guacamole, making Drac pass gas. These are pretty much the same reasons ElectricDragon505 aka Animat said about this franchise. So this movie in my opinion gets a 5/10.",/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2018,hott_kitty_moew,10," El Macarena
","I watched this movie on June 30th, Amazon Prime Member. My kids and myself. Enjoyed this movie. A very cute summer movie. I believe this movie is just for kids and adults! Kids humor were they understand. I heard so many kids laughter and engaged to the movie. Not even a cry, not even loud remarks or playing with some sort of toy/phone. I will be back to watch this on the 14th of July!. It's a good movie for the whole family. Bleh Bleh Bleh!",/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2018,serenacroteau,9," Or as the locals say it...
","I'm not going to lie, when I first heard about them making another Hotel Translyvania I was a real sceptic. I was worried they were stretching the story too far. But I was completely wrong! Every other second I was laughing and during they few that I wasn't, I was trying to catch my breath! It's a hilarious family movie that also has sentimental moments scattered throughout the movie.",/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv

20 August 2018,sarahcarter-57143,1," Awful
","We as a family loved the first two films but this was boring bland and not at all funny the ""jokes"" fell flat and seemed forced not one person in the cinema laughed all through the film don't waste your time seeing this film",/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2018,oscaralbert,7," First, the Montagues and the Capulets . . .
",". . . then the Hatfields and the McCoys, and NOW we have a love connection between the Van Helsing and the Dracula Families?! TRANSYLVANIA 3: SUMMER VACATION posits that the former clan can bury their hatchets (or oak stakes), while the latter blood-thirsty crew can simply switch to V-8 Juice consumption. Not everyone will buy this, just as the play ""Summer for Hitler"" (featuring that catchy lyric, ""Oh, the Nazis and the Semites should be FRIENDS!"") flopped at the box office, closing after just 11 not-sold-out performances. However, at a time when an Oval Office Occupant is taking his cues from ""Saturday Night Live"" by jumping into bed with ""Mad Vlad,"" the Russian Czar, perhaps TRANSYLVANIA's Glad Dad (aka, Count D) hitting the sheets with a Van Helsing is just another sign of these, The End Times. So don't be surprised if TRANSYLVANIA's Sony bosses borrow Bambi from Disney for a sequel in which Thumper's godson romances a hunter's daughter. Sure, the groom's granny won't be attending any of the wedding festivities (since Walt served her up as meat balls in the 1900s), but isn't an after-dinner belch somewhat of a happy ending?",/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2018,subxerogravity,7," Very by the numbers animated movie.
",A little surprise that Hotel Transylvania made it up to three squeals. I did not think the first flick was so good to produce three more.,/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's Thursday and you know what that means... Yes, another Robbie's Movie Reviews. Tonight, is an animated sequel, hoping to live up to the magic and bring about another family friendly adventure to bring your little ones flocking to theater. Will it be the success they want in regards to quality, or is it mainly a cash grab of the studio to try and compete with the Disney mega corporation. Robbie K is here and ready to write another review... this time on: ",/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2018,Animated_Antic,8," A slightly bumpy but still fun sequel.
","Why do critics hate on the ""Hotel Transylvania"" series? Is it because Adam Sandler is in it? That might be it, though I honestly haven't gotten a clue. My reaction to the series is kind of interesting. I thought the first movie was decent but didn't really see rewatch value in it while I thought two was pretty good and actually found it did have rewatch value. Now we have the third movie in the series, ""Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation"", a film that I also really enjoyed. I don't think it was as good as the second movie, but I still found it a pretty fun watch.",/review/rw4241752/?ref_=tt_urv
