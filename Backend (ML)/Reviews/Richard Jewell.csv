27 December 2014,blanche-2,6," Lifetime, what did I expect
","It's very sad to see beautiful, talented Jennifer Beals in a film like this, but such is the price of turning 50 in Hollywood. I give her credit -- she works much more than many other women her age. I think she could have afforded to skip this one.",/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2017,metalrage666,1," The nightmare is in watching this in the first place
","Oh my God what a lame and poorly executed piece of trash this is. Believe me when I tell you that this review will concisely and accurately detail the mess that this show is and if you still decide to watch it, then I accept no responsibility for your inevitable brain aneurysm.

19 January 2020,brookenichole-98054,8," Um... wow
","This movie was insane! I felt on the edge of my seat the whole time! The acting was better than most Lifetime movies. Once the ending came, it felt like a whole mess. But an entertaining awesome type of mess! Jennifer Beals was amazing! She really showed how insane a person can get.",/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2015,Horst_In_Translation,6," Not great, but good
","""A Wife's Nightmare"" is a very recent entry to Emmy-winning Vic Sarin's Nightmare movie series. However, it does really not become clear until almost the very end till we now why it says ""Mom's"" in the title. The movie runs slightly under 90 minutes as usual for these television films and the title character is played by Jennifer Beals. Thanks to ""Flashdance"" she is also easily the most known cast member, certainly the only star in here. However, I felt that all the other 3 major cast members played their parts as well and especially about Lola Tash we may hear a lot in the future. She plays a kind of Lolita character who her dad is attracted to, who kisses her brother and gets other boys have a crush on her.",/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv

19 April 2020,miijim-66227,1," What a dumb premise
","Had his plan worked , how does he explain shacking up with the daughter? Preposterous.",/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2018,miralew-87632,10," Jennifer Beals is fantastic as always.
",I originally purchased this film just because Jennifer Beals was in it. I was not disappointed. Jennifer Beals is without a shadow of a doubt a versatile talented actress. The film had great intrigue and I like that. As far as I'm concerned if Jennifer Beals is in a film it's gonna be a great film!,/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2020,morbidlove21,6," Decent, Not Great
","I decided to watch this because I'm a fan of Jennifer Beals. The acting was fine, although the story wasn't entirely original. There are several movies out there with the ""husband or wife is having an affair when will they be caught?"" premise, and many of those other movies do it with more suspense.",/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2015,CanadianBill,4," Another sub-par-to-average Canadian movie production, yay!
","The poorly-written premise here, supposedly based on 'true events', is about a 19 yr old girl who finds her father after her mom died. The first 70-odd minutes of this movie has a vanilla, almost Disney-like feel to it. The final 15 or 20 will actually be worth it for some, and another predictable and thus disappointing end to others.",/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2016,wes-connors,5," Help Me Make It through the Nightmare
","Following a nervous breakdown, attractive businesswoman Jennifer Beals (as Elizabeth ""Liz"" Michaels) is sent home from the psychiatric hospital. With help from some balancing medication, Ms. Beals believes she can also return to work. This is great news, because handsome musician husband Dylan Neal (as Gabe) is still looking for a best-seller, after completing two albums. The couple have one son, cute high school-aged Spencer List (as AJ). For some unexplained reason, Mr. List can't attract a pretty girl at school. After grocery shopping one day, mom and dad are accosted by beautiful blonde 19-year-old Lola Tash (as Caitlin Patterson). She claims her recently deceased mother named Mr. Neal as her father...",/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2020,snowflowerz,10," A great movie, loved it!
","I stumbled on this movie one night after going through my list of movies to watch. I decided to watch it even thought I thought ho hum, this looks like a movie that's been done so many times before. Trust me it's not at all what you think, it's really good, actors are great and I was not even expecting it to turn out like it did. Watch it, you won't be sorry!",/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2020,DE179,2," Wait, what??
","It was a Thursday I think and there was nothing on. So, I go to Prime to find something to watch that would hold my attention. I saw Jennifer Beals (or Bette Porter - where my L Word fans at?!) and I thought ""Ohhh, this might be good."" I mean, I love Jennifer Beals and the description seemed to pull me in. So I pushed play.",/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2020,lavatch,9," One of the Better Films Produced by Lifetime
","""A Wife's Nightmare"" is without doubt one of the finest of the Lifetime film offerings. The best word to describe it is: explosive!",/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2022,I_Ailurophile,7," Not without imperfections, but a better TV thriller than I expected
","Even compared to other Lifetime original movies, this one has a very weird energy, whereby it seems like the character writing is just completely scattered; all four principles carry wildly inconsistent vibes throughout most of the length. Even heading into the third act the movie still has yet to give a firm beat on exactly who wife, husband, son, or long-lost daughter are, or what they're doing, and the narrative therefore also comes across as being all over the place. I suppose it's to the credit of the screenwriters that this is perfectly intentional, veiling the true nature of the course of events with a successful cloak of mystery until everything is lined up Just So. It's by design that we viewers are kept guessing. A single line of dialogue is all that it takes for the pieces to start to fall into place - though I think it's also true that there's an issue here insofar as the last twenty minutes throw so much plot at us in such rapid succession that it feels rushed and overfull. When all is said and done I think 'A wife's nightmare' is fairly well done and enjoyable, but I'm not entirely sure how to feel about it.",/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2020,hhunt-85875,3," Entertaining because it's TERRIBLE
","This movie was solely entertaining because the acting was so bad. If you want to feel good about your acting skills, watch this movie. I watch a lot of movies, and this movie is my worst nightmare. The whole movie is rising action, with suspenseful music for no reason. The music is even louder than the dialogue at some points and it is just a mess. Not 100% sure who directed it but it's horrible.",/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2021,Mehki_Girl,4," Guilty Pleasure
","Jennifer plays angry really well. Let this be a lesson ladies. Do not work yourself to the bone and go into debt for a man. He won't appreciate it and will trade you in for a younger model. What the end game was for his airhead minimum wage side piece is beyond me. Was this a community propertystate? Oh and the neighbors couldn't stand his lazy, pimping, gaslighting triggering self. The ending was delicious!",/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2020,fmwongmd,2," Sad
",The screenplay is unbelievably bad bordering on self parody. Jennifer Beals is okay.,/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2020,insideatl,6," Good but should've been better if it wasn't Made for TV
",A Wife's Nightmare is very interesting considering that it's based off real events. It's one of those made for TV drama's; It's watchable and entertaining. The acting was so so. The plot was a little all over the place which made the movie a little confusing at certain points. But understanding the made for TV restrictions It gets a passing grade from me. I truly feel that this would've been a much better film if it wasn't made for TV.,/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2014,geekgirl199025,4," It Could Have Been Good
",I was very disappointed with this movie. It had the potential to be really good. Especially when we couldn't tell WHAT was going on. But of course it turned out to be clich√©d by the end. Of course.,/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2020,rogerjghannam,10," Watch
","This movie is diabolical without graphic gremlins.
The boss was harsh and cruel since Beal returned to work. No compassion or respect from him whatsoever.
This is one twisted film. It captivates its audience consistently. The devil walks among us. Well worth viewing.",/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2022,OneAnjel,9," Great story cuz it's real life
","Ok, the acting wasn't great but this is a poetic justice film and women will appreciate how it shows a women who was gaslighted to the point of having a mental breakdown, then being made to believe her fears were baseless and gaslighted some more. That will sound very familiar to a lot of women. To the angry men dismissing this as typical Lifetime, if you're not a loser toying with people then stop taking it so personally. This film just keeps you guessing until the last 20 minutes, then all hell breaks loose. Rewarding ending.",/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2021,annikoop,1," Got through 4 minutes
",Took about 30 seconds for me to realize this was a Lifetime movie.,/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2020,thurlosr,3," Pretty good but also so very awful
","It has a pretty interesting plot, with some ok actors, and a pretty bad script.
Its kinda like a disney show but its a movie and its not intended for children. But it is fun to make fun of as you watch.",/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2021,lyndaand,2," Not bad for no star power
","I've seen worse. Not bad for a no-star-power cast. Jennifer Beals held it together the best she could.
The young son was so bad, it was painful to watch his performance.
Totally predictable plot.
Don't pay for this movie, find it free.",/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2020,njv-85702,5," Maybe a 10??
","The whole story is ridiculous.and the acting is awful. The scenes themselves are terrible because they make no sense. The main character has a huge presentation to do, she shows 3 picture and everyone loves it....Meeting over?? So bad we just couldn't turn away. We've rarely enjoyed laughing so hard at a movie.",/review/rw5660551/?ref_=tt_urv
