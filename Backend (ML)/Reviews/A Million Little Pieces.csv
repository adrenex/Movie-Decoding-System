28 September 2008,JoeKarlosi,7," Ghost Town (2008) ***
","What really made this rather familiar story work for me was British comedian Ricky Gervais in the part of a grouchy NY dentist who starts seeing ghosts after he has a peculiar mishap during a routine colonoscopy. This is a lightweight comedy/drama/love story with elements that we've seen plenty of times before, but as I said I thought Gervais made all the difference, and it's his picture entirely. Had the part been played by Adam Sandler, Jim Carey, or some other over-exposed celebrity, it wouldn't have been as effective. Greg Kinnear is really an afterthought here as a dead man who keeps appealing to Gervais to help break up the inevitable wedding of his widow (Tea Leoni). *** out of ****",/review/rw3317736/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2008,Vic_max,," Not exactly ""laugh out loud funny"", but very well done.
","While this movie is comedy, it's not really a major ""laugh-fest"" or anything - but it is very well done and interesting to watch. If you're a fan of Ricky Gervais, he's only an actor here, not the writer or producer - so don't expect lots of Gervais-inspired humor. However, do expect a clever and charming romantic comedy.",/review/rw3317736/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2008,MRavenwood,9," See it in the Theatre. It's Worth It!
","The story: A dentist, played by Ricky Gervais, is sick of dealing with people. Not just a few people; everyone. Social niceties annoy him and ""just being friendly"" is out of the question. But this doesn't prevent annoying chatter from following him to his dental practice or even to the hospital where he must undergo his first colonoscopy. While the doctors roll him down a corridor on a gurney, chatting about frivolous nonsense, he interrupts and insists on full anesthesia for the examination.",/review/rw3317736/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2008,maureenmcqueen,8," Death Becomes Him
","A true delight. Ghost Town is David Koepp's most original script since Death Becomes Her and Death Becomes Her is one of my favorite comedies of all time. Daring, hilarious and elegant. Ghost Town is set in a more recognizable world, recognizable from many different angles, at times it feels we've seen all this before but what sets it apart is its heart. There is real heart here and a real intention. Ricky Gervais is fantastic as the ""no people person"" his unlikeable persona becomes the most likable aspect of the movie. I was taken by Gervais's predicament and I was never allowed to slip away. I was entertained and delighted throughout. 8/10",/review/rw3317736/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2008,jaddison383,7," Delightful Little Film!!!
","Ricky Gervais, the star of the British ""The Office"" and ""Extras"", is someone you wouldn't really expect to be on the big screen. Yet here he is, delivering an hilarious and heartfelt performance in what one would usually consider the most clichéd of genres: the romantic comedy.",/review/rw3317736/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," Eventually reveals its surprisingly sweet heart.
","'Ghost Town (2006)' starts out quite cringeworthy, especially considering Gervais' initially grating, typically sarcastic persona. It's also never really funny, often hopping from the broadest of the broad (including 'fart jokes') to more subtle and successful fare in mere moments. Eventually, however, the film reveals its heart and the somewhat soppy, generally generic but ultimately appreciated messages within, which makes for an overall experience that's surprisingly sweet and pleasantly watchable (thanks, in no small part, to the effortlessly likeable Greg Kinnear). 6/10",/review/rw3317736/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2008,cultfilmfan,9," Ghost Town
","Ghost Town is a new film that sounds like it either is a western, or a horror film, but it is actually neither. Instead it is a romantic comedy that has ghosts in it. The story revolves around a socially awkward and obnoxious dentist named Bertram Pincus, who after a medical procedure can see ghosts and one in particular named Frank, who tries to set Bertram up with his now single wife named Gwen. Frank coaches Bertram along, but ultimately to get Gwen to fall for him, Bertram, will have to shed his icy image and become more of a caring and helpful person. Ghost Town opened to really good reviews pretty much all around, but unfortunately it is doing really poorly at the box office. I think this is a romantic comedy that will appeal to a really large number of people because it is a feel good film, has some really good comic moments and because of the good performances, especially by Ricky Gervais who plays Bertram. The premise of the film is almost like The Sixth Sense meets Cyrano de Bergerac, but at the same time it also does have a lot of originality and some neat plot twists and turns. A lot of the comedies that have come out this year and that have been successful were more or less cruder more adult fare comedies, and while I enjoyed a lot of them personally, I realized that they would definitely not be for everyone. Ghost Town on the other hand will work for both crowds because it is still very entertaining and funny, but not overly crass, crude or risky enough to prevent more conservative viewers, or even kids from seeing it. I think a lot of people will like the romantic part of the film and I think a lot of people will also enjoy Ricky Gervais as Bertram and just how un likable he is and how funny he is to watch. The subplot with the ghosts is also a neat twist to the film that adds a lot of laughs and originality to the film as well. This is one of the best feel good comedies of the year, that like I said, will appeal to many different people and I think once it is rediscovered on DVD that it will become a sleeper hit because of how good it is and I can really seeing this being a crowd favourite and for obvious reasons because of the great performances and the feel good yet funny script. This is definitely one to see if it is still playing in theatres near you, or rent it in five months when it hits video shelves.",/review/rw3317736/?ref_=tt_urv

27 October 2008,Otoboke,," Charming, delightful and full of life.
","The morbid comedy or, the comedy in which half of its characters are actually ghosts, can be a tough sale for most audiences, and amongst the biggest cynics of anything to do with cinematic spirits haunting the screen is I. The reasoning behind this hard-to-sell concept is simple; the dead, that is, the spirit likeness of a human being, in modern society are usually treated with grave seriousness. From the grim tales of the Bible to images of mourning families trying to 'celebrate' during a wake; the concepts of the afterlife and comedy quite often juxtapose to the point where bemusement brought on through absurdity is more commonplace than laughter. Therefore it was no surprise earlier this year when romantic comedy Over Her Dead Body failed to deliver much laughs or even romance at all, instead only taking the two clashing ideas and, well, clashing them together hoping it would all work out in the end (it didn't). While Ghost Town doesn't necessarily do anything remotely different from the aforementioned feature –at least concerning the script's comedy department- it is in the movie's emotional core and characters present that such clashing of half-baked spiritual plotting with slapstick comedy gets softened into something a lot more digestible. The result is a story that fails to register on an engaging level based upon its basic premise alone, but eventually more than makes up for it with a sweet romance that tickles just as much as it warms the heart.",/review/rw3317736/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2009,JoeytheBrit,," This isn't going to hurt
","Ricky Gervaise is one of those comedians who should be more annoying than he actually is. That's not to say he isn't annoying - he is - but this annoyance factor is surpassed by his sense of humour and comic timing. He gives a good performance here, and is entirely believable as a cold misanthropic dentist who finds himself harassed by dead people after temporarily dying himself on the operating table. Greg Kinnear is the dead guy who manages to monopolise Gervaise's services and it is in the relationship between these two - and Kinnear's wife (Tea Leoni) - that the film finds it's heart.",/review/rw3317736/?ref_=tt_urv

23 May 2014,harrypaulson-111,8," A Gem
","I can't understand how I missed it. Written and directed by David Koepp, the man who wrote ""Apartment Zero"" and ""Death Becomes Her"" with Martin Donovan, a personal hero of mine. Not to mention some of the biggest moneymakers of the last two decades. ""Ghost Town"" strives for something else, it pinpoints the goodness hidden in the heart of someone who, perhaps, never knew was there. A comedy of personal discovery no less. I was moved and delighted. Ricky Gervais goes through it, stumbling over himself with an innocence that is as real as it is mysterious. I connected with him half way through and it took me by surprise. I was loving a character that at the beginning I thought was funny but despicable. That for me means I've learned something. Thank you.",/review/rw3317736/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ghost Town is a fairly underappreciated movie from the late 2000s. What a hilarious movie, I really enjoyed this, Ricky Gervais never fails to entertain me with his relatable humour of hating people its perfect. The character Gervais plays is a very relatable one, I like how he has created a character that is so relatable in this day and age, who even likes people anymore.",/review/rw3317736/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2008,Smells_Like_Cheese,6," Predictable, but it's a decent comedy
","After a stressful day, I needed a good comedy to lighten up my mood and I had been hearing a lot of good things on Ghost Town. So I saw it last Sunday, over all I think it was a pretty funny comedy, although I wasn't laughing as hard as the other audience members, but I had a nice time watching it, I think the reason why was due to how predictable it was. For example... the lead character can talk to ghosts, what do we constantly see in ghost movies? The character who can see or speak to ghosts looks crazier because they talk to the ghosts right in front of people who obviously can't see or hear the ghosts. The story was also a typical romantic comedy that wasn't really original. But one thing I was impressed with this movie was how strong Ricky Gervais held his own as a male lead, with Greg Kinnear, they made a good match. They both had great comedic timing and looked like they had a great time making this movie.",/review/rw3317736/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2008,george.schmidt,7," Gervais is the saving grace in this hybrid of ""Ghost"", ""Topper"" and ""All of Me""
","GHOST TOWN (2008) **1/2 Ricky Gervais, Greg Kinnear, Tea Leoni, Dana Ivey, Bill Campbell, Alan Ruck, Claire Lautier, Aasif Mandvi. Kristen Wiig. Gervais is the saving grace in this hybrid of ""Ghost"", ""Topper"" and ""All of Me"" as a misanthropic dentist whose routine surgery causes a brief moment of his death and the end result in seeing and hearing ghosts, including recently departed Kinnear, who wants desperately to re-connect with his widow (Leoni). A fairly decent mix of screwball comedy and Gervais' dead-panned, put-upon , awkward social comedy skills make up for the rather formulaic yet winning high-concept fish-out-of-water comedy in the long run; Wiig as his surgeon steals the film.

30 September 2013,Hey_Sweden,8," The tag line is brilliant.
","And the film itself is rather fresh and interesting, not quite the usual romantic comedy / drama; ordinarily this is not a genre that this viewer would seek out, but it's the central character and performance that make the difference, as we watch a bitter and grumpy person with a dislike of people in general regain his humanity. In that sense, the movie is predictable, but getting to the conclusion is still fun.",/review/rw3317736/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2015,anaconda-40658,9," Gervais Sees Dead People.
","Ghost Town (2008): Dir: David Koepp / Cast: Ricky Gervais, Greg Kinnear, Tea Leoni, Billy Campbell, Kristen Wiig: Hilarious comedy about a shallow existence. Ricky Gervais plays a dentist whom has an operation where he was pronounced dead for seven minutes. Now he is able to see images of deceased people whom request his help in solving issues that prevent them from peace. Directed by David Koepp who previously made such supernatural thrillers as Stir of Echoes and Secret Window. This marks his first supernatural comedy and it is one of his best. Gervais is excellent as the harassed dentist whom avoids social interaction but ultimately learns compassion. Greg Kinnear plays a ghost whom requests his help in preventing his wife, played by Tea Leoni, from marrying another man, who may or may not be as thought. The great thing about Kinnear's role is it is someone who fails to view his own flaws. Leoni begins as a subject of rejection and rudeness by Gervais but she will ultimately discover herself as well as find peace with herself, Kinnear and the economy. Billy Campbell as her fiancé is a more predictable role but works especially in a scene involving laughing gas. Kristen Wiig plays a surgeon who is self involved and ends up working on Gervais. The results in a very funny film with a strong theme regarding one's unit within society. Score: 9 / 10",/review/rw3317736/?ref_=tt_urv
