19 February 2020,UniqueParticle,9," Feel good entertainment with a great story
","I love watching Real steel whenever possible, delightful scenes especially with the kid and Hugh Jackman is awesome throughout! VFX are incredible and well polished; I'm glad it was nominated. Shawn Levy has done many projects under his belt that I have absolutely loved or even just consider a guilty pleasure which is nice too. I like the cuteness in many parts, definitely one of the better robot movies made in last couple decades!",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2020,brentcollyer,7," A great fun family movie
","Just watched this movie with my 8 yo daughter and it was a lot of fun, she really loved it and I thought it was very well done and easy to watch. Lot's of very negative reviews not sure what they were expecting, I don't think anyone involved was planning a trip to the Oscars. Sometimes it's good to just relax and not over critique everything.",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2012,hitchcockthelegend,7," No splitting this Atom, it has got a rock solid heart.
","Real Steel is directed by Shawn Levy and collectively adapted to the screen by John Gatins, Dan Gilroy and Jeremy Leven from a Richard Matheson short story called Steel. It stars Hugh Jackman, Dakota Goyo, Evangeline Lilly, Anthony Mackie, Kevin Durand, Hope Davis and James Rebhorn. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Mauro Fiore.",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2020,denvertts,10," A gem still in 2020!
","#3 on Netflix! Well deserved! I've watched this movie at least 3 times every year since it came out in 2011. Saw it pop up on Netflix & had tears in my eyes in the same parts I always do. This movie is full of heart & I will always love it. Fighters, fathers, underdogs will feel this movie to their core. ATOM!",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2012,StevePulaski,8," Doesn't lead us down the road of ""coolness""
","My response to Real Steel is almost parallel to Hugh Jackman's reaction to the robot fighter Atom in the film. Upon initial advertising and trailers, I wasn't impressed by the film one bit. It looked like another film that glorified the ""coolness"" of robots, and then tried to tack on a contrived story of a father and son relationship. Never did I believe I'd see it and actually award it a positive score. Just like in the film where Jackman doesn't believe Atom has what it takes to be a successful fighter, and then is greeted with a rude awakening.",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2011,martinrobertson300482,6," Soooo Cheesy!
","""Real Steel"" is the cheesiest movie I've seen in quite some time. After a promising start, flick starts getting over confident in telling its story. A Story we've already seen before in ""Rocky"" and its many clones.",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2020,whitejra1,7," Rocky with Robots
","This movie was quite entertaining. It's a bit strange because of the fact that robots fight instead of humans. With that said, the robots are perfectly anthropomorphized so you feel like they are men.",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2011,jon.h.ochiai,9," ""Real Steel"" is the Real Deal
","""Real Steel"" is awesome. I did not expect this going in. It is more than just ""Transformers"" meets ""Rocky"" doing ""rock-um sock-um robots"". I saw Hugh Jackman on Jimmy Fallon talk about what made him enroll in the project. ""Real Steel"" beyond the visually astounding CGI glitz and spectacle is the touching story of father and son defining love and respect. Again, not all that surprising given Steven Spielberg is Executive Producer. I'm a fan of Jackman. ""Real Steel"" may be his crossover hit that leverages his amazing gifts, playing a real guy, and not a superhero. He is awesome, as well. As Jackman describes ""Real Steel"" is about second chances, and redemption. Sure the story's climax pits underdog undersized fighting robot Atom against the ferocious indestructible Zeus. For me, ""Real Steel"" resonates in its human voice. Hugh Jackman as Charlie confesses to his son Max (scene stealing Dakota Goyo), ""You deserve better than me."" Charlie asks Max, what he wants from him. Max answers, ""I want you to fight for me!"" Yes, ""Real Steel"" is fighting for love with everything you have. ""Real Steel"" is the real deal.",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2011,Jonathon_Natsis,5," Could've, Would've, Should'vebut Didn't.
","What a little gem Real Steel could have been. Well before its release, and before any intricate plot details became known, this sounded like an intelligent film in which robots are forced to engage in brutal fights for the entertainment of their human masters. Where the story would've gone from there is left to the imagination, but it appeared to have all the makings of critically acclaimed, self-conscious science fiction. The final product differed heavily from initial expectations, however, and we are left with a hollow, albeit bearable alternative prompting those such as myself to ask: What could have been?",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2021,classicsoncall,7," ""You know you're talking to a robot.""
","I'll go out on a limb here and guess that the first time the idea of boxing robots was put to film was the fourth season Twilight Zone episode titled 'Steel', which aired on October 4th, 1963. Lee Marvin starred in that one, and when his mechanical fighter broke down against an opponent by losing it's left arm, Marvin's character put on a metal suit to enter the ring. I won't give away the ending, but if you think man vs. machine, you might guess the outcome.",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2011,TourettesPersonal,8," The Heart Of Steel
","Based on what everybody said, Real Steal is like Over The Top plus Rocky with Robots. Over The Top because there's a man, his son, and a truck. Rocky because it's obvious. Put these films together and add robots and minus Stallone. Real Steel is not very innovating though but it's excitingly great and has plenty of heart. It's also the return of Hugh Jackman although we just saw him a little last June. There are lot of things to recommend in Real Steel.",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2011,DICK STEEL,," A Nutshell Review: Real Steel
","Real Steel is a science fiction fantasy piece that imagines a world in future where all that is possible, where humans take control of giant robots to do battle on their behalf in the boxing ring. But those looking for robot fight after robot fight might be better off with watching the Transformers trilogy from start to end, since you only get a handful of robot battles, with the bulk being montaged away in the midsection and the final fight even, which leaves behind an aftertaste of being short changed on the entertainment front, since we're like the spectators on screen, ready to see some hard hitting action from the get go.",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2012,NelsonJoshAlden,7," I am against Corny/Cheesy Actors
","I had low expectations and I am sure many people did so too, however I did rather quite enjoy the movie for various factors in which I will List: Every scene had purpose - No pointless scenes which have no impact on the audience. The Ending - Original and Motivating, showed it had a moral to the story (If you watched the movie, you would know)",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2012,claudio_carvalho,5," Impressive CGI and Poor Story
","In 2020, boxing is no longer fought by humans that have been replaced by robots. The former boxer Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) drives his truck to promote fights with his robot Ambush. When he has just lost a fight, he is summoned to a hearing and forced to take care of his unknown eleven year-old son Max Kenton (Dakota Goyo) since his mother has passed away.

20 January 2012,quarterwave-271-907469,8," Feel Good, Fun Movie !
","I wasn't expecting much when I saw this movie - and I'm not really a fan of movies where kid's are the lead - but, I was pleasantly surprised with this one.",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2013,SnoopyStyle,5," Charlie is a douche, kid is annoying, robot fighting cool
","Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is a loser in robot fighting. His robots are old out of date junkers. His showboating costs him his last robot. When his kid's mother die, he's left with the kid. Not only does he want to abandon the kid, he blackmails the kid's aunt (Hope Davis)'s rich husband (James Rebhorn) holding the kid hostage. Ladies, he's a real keeper.",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2021,jester-44793,9," How can you not like this movie
",Great film and the bits where the main character connects with his son were very touching against the backdrop of him rediscovering his love for fighting! Jackman plays the part well and the boy manages to not being an annoying stereotype kid!,/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2015,adihtc,9," Great Movie. Sci-fi robot boxing with a lot of emotions!

27 September 2011,gremlins-haunt-my-house,9," Great movie, good story. Who doesn't like fighting robots??
","We saw an advanced screening on Sept 22. I thought it was going to be another one of those cheesy, campy, not really believable, warm fuzzy, type of underdog/rags to riches movies. I was actually surprised. It had some great plot twists, it had a real story line. And while yes, there is some language sprinkled throughout, it did make a good family movie for older kids, 10+ (my opinion). The ending wasn't quite what I was expecting, but looking back I think I liked it better for that. Who wants an ending they can see coming the entire movie?",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2011,george_jozwiak,10," Outstanding
","Any movie that gets the audience involved in a positive way and leaving cheering is an excellent movie. It is like Rocky on adrenaline and with a whole lot better acting. Hugh Jackman, Evangeline Lilly and Dakota Goyo all have great performances. Dakota who plays the son really makes the movie, but all the actors performances are great. The guy who thought it boring... well, you lack passion and your soul must be dead. Real Steel is the absolutely hands down best movie I have seen in a long time. You will cheer, cry, laugh and be thoroughly entertained. I had to sit and watched the credits at the end just to catch my breath. Great movie.",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2012,pc95,4," Badly Clichéd and PG
","""Real Steel"" starring Hugh Jackman and directed by Shawn Levy is an awful clichéd bunch of trite. It reaches into the dozen or so boxing movies in a grab bag of hackneyed and rip-off situations from much better movies. It tries to be original by throwing in robots as the boxers, but ultimately the outcome is more like a bad video game movie. The one where the story gets washed away by unintelligent and patronizing dialog. Hugh Jackman instills some needed energy, and the sci-fi concept has some merit, but the PG script and storyline is steaming turd. An ""R"" rating, adult script, and tossing out the whole father/son mush would've sharpened the movie some. The music is gawd-awful and brainless with a mix or rock, rap, and cheesy dramatic interludes from a soap-opera, and the romance is perfunctory. Overall bad - not recommended",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2011,avinashbhan,9," Great Movie. Perfect Match of emotions, Robo-fight(very Importantly not over done) and some comic scenes.

7 October 2011,Happy_Evil_Dude,7," A Spielbergian movie with a lot of heart
","Most of the time, if a film director hits the big time, it's usually that one of his films, early on in his career, has made a huge smash and given him status and power. This is the case for people like Spielberg, Lucas, Coppola, Shyamalan, Cameron, etc... However, if there's one director that has been steadily moving up the ranks of the Hollywood over the past ten years or so, starting out small and tackling on bigger, more ambitious and more prestigious projects as he goes on, it's definitely Canadian filmmaker Shawn Levy.",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2012,DJRMewzique,1," Unless you're under the age of 12, seriously...don't bother.
","When this film was first announced about a year ago, I immediately added to my film schedule months in advance: It had a cool name and hey, it was a movie with robots and the always hot Hugh Jackman! Then the trailer came out, and the story was revealed to be touching family film about a dad and his estranged son with robots thrown in. A sweet family film? Ugh. I immediately took it off my viewing schedule. Then the reviews came out, and even Entertainment Weekly gave it an excellent review, saying that it is actually way better than you would expect. Pair that with big box office, and my curiosity started to come around again. Finally, it got an Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects, and thus, I no longer had a choice.",/review/rw2562065/?ref_=tt_urv
