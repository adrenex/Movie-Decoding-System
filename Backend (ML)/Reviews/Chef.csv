13 September 2021,zaenkney,9," Great Series! Family friendly
","I loved this and I hope it goes on a while. No bad language, no sexually explicit scenes, it's funny yet has real bad guy/gals. I did not get bored. But, then, I don't need explosions, car chases, CGI or blood and gore. This series is worth a watch. Sit back and enjoy.",/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2021,sdowen-59793,8," It gets better with future episodes
",The first 2 episodes are awkward. The show improves by the third episode when the characters find their rhythm. Frankie Drake had a similar rough start.,/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," So far so good!
","It's a great storyline and perfectly cast. The genre is crime and drama on IMDb, but I found this episode subtly hilarious. Meredith MacNeill is great in this and makes me laugh, and pairing her character up with Adrienne C. Moore was spot on. Katie Douglas' performance was great and the rest of the casting couldn't been better. There was even some awesome soundtracks. Directing is on point, and I hope this series' writers can keep up the great work. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me - for now.",/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2021,wildsheep-49617,8," Don't get all the hate
","I can't understand the level of vitriol targeting this show - I mean, it's a pleasant little Canadian cop show, people need to relax a little. I also wasn't too impressed after the first episode but wow, the show has grown by leaps and bounds since then and I now look forward to it each week. Yes, of course the American actress is the best actor on the show, but what would you expect? Everyone else puts in a good effort and I think after this rookie season the show will be as good as any other cop show on TV, in fact, much, much better than the usual US fare. If people don't like it, they don't need to tune in, but I'm enjoying it immensely.",/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2021,virtual-93888,8," Finally a Female Buddy Cop Show That Works
","I'm really liking this show. It's pretty smart. Well cast. Entertaining and different. Comparing it to Law & Order SVU the 2 main characters remind me of Iced Tea and Munch - arguably, 2 of the most interesting characters on SVU. The women talk to each other like real people and both define and defend their quirkiness without coming across as fake. I'll be marathoning it.",/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2021,gdump,7," It's not Barney Miller; It's not Brooklyn 99
","It's something in between. It's a dramedy more than a comedy. MacNeill plays her character a little too over the top, the bad guys are too dumb, the plot is like Swiss cheese, but it is still entertaining. It's not worthy of awards, but I think it's worth a second season.",/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2021,kylievision,9," LOL FUNNY
",One of the few shows that makes me laugh out loud...also nothing better than feel good funny.,/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2021,smartyred,9," I'm entertained. Course, I don't crave violence and can live without machismo.
","Another reviewer called it quirky. I agree. it's the imperfect characters who are so charming and relatable. I really like this show. The naysayers should spend more time watching what they do like, instead of trolling.",/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2021,anavrinin,8," Not sure what all the hate is about
",I like this show! It's funny and interesting. Very confused as to why so many people chose to write these awful reviews. Things that make you go hmmmmm....?,/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2021,dlwooden-333-856395,9," Weirdly Interesting
",I really enjoy this show. The characters are interesting weird and funny. I like the show because it's like you are becoming friends with characters as they become friends with each other. If you like crime shows like Law and Order and tv shows like Friends and Scrubs will you love this because it's like a combination of the two genres. I can't wait for season 2.,/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2021,katieintoronto,9," Worth giving this show a look
","I hope people give this show a chance. I originally was afraid it was going to be fluff, but it's a really good detective show. As the story line develops, so do the characters, and the two leads in particular are excellent - I love the dynamic between them. I just recently picked it up and have been binge watching it. Can't wait for more!",/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2021,Ed-Shullivan,5," Starsky & ""Not Much""
","Is this a crime / drama or a straight up sitcom? The first 15 minutes of banter between Detectives Samantha Wazowski from Guns and Gangs, (Meredith MacNeill) and Kelly Duff from the Drug Squad (Adrienne C. Moore) quite frankly left me dizzy, and as such I thought this pilot episode was kind of dopey. Of course these two quirky cops are after the same thing, a big time drug dealer, so they reluctantly try to work together and wouldn't you know it, their two vastly different styles of policing seems to work in catching the bad guys.",/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,CatSweet,10," Love it
","Love that show. So much fun and it's so entertaining. The two main characters complement each other so well. One is the bad-ass, he other very uptight. This is the kind of show I love to watch with a lot of humour. Glad to know there is a season 2. Hoping for more in the future.",/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2021,splode-78793,8," Character Driven Storytelling
","The two leads are complex, vastly different styles and it's been fun to see them clash. And both are great at holding their own rhythms and are written and played with truth. They feel like real humans. The supporting all have hints of depth and I'll be interested to see where they take this cast. The stakes got good and high in Ep. 4 so that has me bought in. It always takes a series most of first season to lay a foundation and then writers can play with all the connections. Hopefully they go for surprising and not by the book for this sort of cop show.",/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2021,Max_Lucas,2," I wasn't entertained.
","Really not much to say about it. Except ask, So are we supposed to use a different rating system just because there are a few mentions that this is a Canadian show? I don't see reviewers on other shows, saying ""What you expect, it's Korean, Spanish or French, don't be too salty..."" Ratings should not be determined by where the studio is located... Wasn't Stargate and 'aboat' 50% other U.S. shows filmed in Toronto?
This show is just bad, no chemistry, no humor, no action. And reminding me it came from Canada isn't going to change my rating.",/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2022,kylecurry,10," Slow start but becomes very entertaining by mid-season.
",It took me a couple of episodes to decide if I liked any of the characters in this buddy cop comedy-drama. It's a Canadian show so has a slightly different flavor than a typical Hollywood or New York cop show. As it becomes more serious in the middle of the season the characters gain depth and the show becomes very entertaining and the drama very compelling.,/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2021,edjambor,10," So refreshing!
",Most bad reviews are from people who didn't even finish watching the first episode - their loss!,/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2021,angiemitch,," I've thoroughly enjoyed this show ...
","I've watched all of Season 1 now and have really enjoyed it. There aren't a lot of shows I watch anymore on network tv, but I have really looked forward to watching this each week. The leads are fantastic and the support characters are all great. Love seeing the Toronto backdrops as well. I'm hopeful it will return for a second season!",/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2021,sramage-49321,8," Definitely gets juicy
","A few episodes in and the story lines and character development are getting really good! We're getting to see that these two cops are actually very good at their jobs. The depth of the supporting characters brings a lot to it too, the development of the same story line over multiple episodes means that we get to follow the bad guys too, and some of them are turning out to be pretty creepy. (I do find it strange that this is Toronto and we haven't seen any Asian characters yet, I feel like you might have to make extra effort to achieve that.)",/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2021,jirvin_98,9," Really Enjoying This Show!
","Love the chemistry between the 2 leads, Meredith MacNeill and Adrienne C. Moore. The former's wackiness and the latter's coolness make for truly hilarious,
laugh out loud moments. The show is very well cast, well-acted and very entertaining. Kudos to the writers, keep up the good work!",/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2021,queenmjsmith,8," Better than I expected.
","I wasn't expecting much but I'm a few episodes in and I'm liking it.
If you're looking for a serious crime show, go somewhere else. It's comedic and perfectly casted. Love that it's filmed and takes place in Toronto. So far so good.",/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2021,eStAMoVe,10," Fun show to watch!
","I'm not really into watching TV or dramatic series. But I'm enjoying watching this new show. It's light-hearted (just what is needed right now in 2021), features a talented mostly Canadian crew and despite what some of the negative reviewers are saying, I find the show very unique in it's own right and not a copy of anything I have seen before.",/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2021,tcdb-52412,10," So glad I found this!
","I just happened to stumble upon this show. So glad I did. The acting is very good, the writing is good. I was really happy to hear that there will be a season 2! Interesting funny, with a little heartfelt drama. Love it. Characters aren't perfect, sort of like Monk. Dean McDermott is a bit of a surprise. He's very good in this show. I think he found his niche. Good for him!",/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2021,trinni-2,10," Funny and engaging
",This show has strong characters and well acted. It took a few episodes to get into it but it has definitely hooked me in now. The two leads seem to really settle into a great buddy cop feel after the third episode and the relationship between the leads is fun,/review/rw6739796/?ref_=tt_urv
