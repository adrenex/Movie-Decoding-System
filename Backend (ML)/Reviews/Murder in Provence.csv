29 November 2008,evanston_dad,10," One of the Most Deeply Affecting Movies I've Seen in a Long Time
","It's virtually impossible to summarize my feelings on ""Synecdoche, New York."" This astonishing brain teaser from the mind of Charlie Kaufman affected me deeply, probably more than any film I've yet seen this year. I can't say it's necessarily enjoyable, because it's full of uncomfortable, brave truths about what it means to be human, and it goes places most movies don't dare to. But watching it is a bracing experience, and it's encouraging to know that there are still filmmakers willing to use film as a means of challenging their audiences and picking at scabs that most people would prefer to remain solidly in place.",/review/rw1955198/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2008,Quinoa1984,9," to call it a disappointment might almost be a compliment, but I dare you to see it
","Note: This works MUCH better on a repeat viewing, practically a masterpiece, and one of the perfectly sad comedies ever made... though the last ten minutes is a slog (perhaps intentionally, as it's near the end of the tunnel... but it's still unbearable).",/review/rw1955198/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2008,commandercool88,8," A thought-provoking, challenging Kaufman experience.
","syn⋅ec⋅do⋅che: a figure of speech in which a part is used for the whole or the whole for a part, the special for the general or the general for the special 'Synecdoche, New York' marks Charlie Kaufman's directorial debut. A monumental event on its own right. It is a maddening venture, a staggering project to face life's greatest of mysteries. Kaufman takes us on a soul-searching journey, one that he is taking every bit as much as we. It is a trip unlike any I have ever seen, and to say that I enjoyed it would be a very difficult thing to say. But 'Synecdoche' seems to be pointing towards something very profound, as undecipherable as it may appear. A flawed masterpiece, and a risk Kaufman seems willing to take.",/review/rw1955198/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2017,lee_eisenberg,10," hyperreality affects the mind, the spirit, and the body
","I wouldn't go so far as to call Charlie Kaufman's ""Synecdoche, New York"" one of the greatest movies of its decade, but its intellectual profundity makes it one of the most impressive pieces of work. This story of a theater director whose life is unraveling has so many layers that it's hard to describe. An obvious point is that the movie goes to great lengths to blur fiction and reality, as the protagonist's play begins to look more and more like real life.",/review/rw1955198/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2016,SnoopyStyle,6," highly ambitious
",Theater director Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is physically falling apart. He is working on the play Death of a Salesman with his leading lady Claire Keen (Michelle Williams). His wife Adele Lack (Catherine Keener) goes on a trip with their daughter Olive. Box office girl Hazel (Samantha Morton) keeps flirting with him. He gets a grant and rents out a giant space. He starts building a play where the cast does everyday things. The world inside the giant space starts becoming more real than the real world. Caden and Claire become parents with a girl as reality and fiction become indistinguishable.,/review/rw1955198/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2020,ronakkotian,9," Ambitious, deep and depressing

18 June 2014,namashi_1,10," Philip Seymour Hoffman. An Immortal Actor.
","Philip Seymour Hoffman. An actor par-excellence, who tragically passed away four months back at the age of 46, had a career of only ups, in my opinion. Be it a cameo, a supporting part, or even being a leading-man, Hoffman never failed to astonish us, with his sheer brilliance as an actor. And in 'Synecdoche, New York', Hoffman delivers a tour-de-force performance as a man in search of life. Hoffman dominates the show with a sterling act!",/review/rw1955198/?ref_=tt_urv

21 March 2021,benjaminbuss,6," Potential masterpiece takes a wrong turn into the be-wilderness
","The account of a troubled play-write, who's professional and personal life is severely hampered by hypochondria and paranoia. PSH brilliantly portrays the main protagonist, who's new production takes on an autobiographical form which spirals out of proportion and cohesion. Director C.Kaufman creates a highly imaginative dream-like study of 'the big picture' of human emotions which undoubtedly contains elements of his own life reflected within the story.",/review/rw1955198/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2020,mardalsfossen01,6," Great idea but the execution is very odd, confusing and tedious to watch
","There's some happenings in the movie which are very abnormal and weird. The main idea is great but in total I felt confused too often, not because of intellectual difficulties in understanding but because it's presented in an odd way. I feel drained after watching, not greatly inspired. A big weird movie which shows the mostly depressing and confusing late life of a theater director.",/review/rw1955198/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2008,loveseedgems,10," Phenomenal
","To start, let's make it clear that this movie will not be for everyone; I don't think any form of authentic art is. There is no flaw in this truth or in the people who do or do not find themselves moved by the art in question- it just is.",/review/rw1955198/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2009,cherold,5," clever but unsatisfying
","It's hard to know what to say about this one. It starts out as just a bleak movie about a depressed guy with mysterious ailments, and for a good chunk of the movie it looks like that's all there's going to be. Then odd surrealistic elements start popping up and time comes loose from its moorings. And eventually the central concept of the ultimate play is introduced.",/review/rw1955198/?ref_=tt_urv

18 October 2008,SeraphZero,10," Kaufman's Most Ambitious Film
","I got to see a screening of this in Boston, and let me admit to the fact that I consider this film a masterpiece. It is a rare entry into the market: an ambitious film, a gamble that, sadly, makes me question how much success it could garner in the mainstream box-office.",/review/rw1955198/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2012,Artimidor,9," Trapped in the simulacrum between life and death
","One thing right ahead: Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's directorial debut is an extremely uncomfortable film. It is likely not to make much sense the first time around, that you are too busy taking it all in and your efforts to understand it get derailed. Many will end up repelled by the experience and don't feel the desire to return to it. Subsequent viewings however should help to value the gargantuan task Kaufman has undertaken and to look forward to further visits to that strange place called ""Synecdoche"". Make no mistake: This is no love story, much less a happy one, not a tale about someone succeeding or get rewarded by any kind of redemption. There are images which seem too trivial to be part of a cinematic masterpiece, and you'll wonder about the surreality of some scenes and the layers upon layers that stack up. But getting into the film and getting out of it again only can be accomplished with difficulty. And that's a good thing.",/review/rw1955198/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2010,MBunge,3," Jiminy Christmas, this thing sucks.
","This movie is like being forced to watch a very ugly naked man take a very, very, very long nap. At the beginning, it's boring and a little odd but there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it. As it goes on, however, the boredom turns to frustration as you just want to look away. Then the frustration turns to disgust as every crooked, misshapen aspect imprints itself on your eyes. The disgust shifts into anger at why someone is doing this to you. Finally, the anger dissolves into a bitter, sarcastic resignation that you just have to sit through this inane thing until it's over and you can do something, anything better with your time.",/review/rw1955198/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2008,marissas75,6," The New Charlie Kaufman: More Ambition and Less Joy
","""Synecdoche, New York"" feels like the work of a man gripped by fear, grief, and a sense that time is running out. The most ambitious of Charlie Kaufman's movies by a long shot, it is also the bleakest. Though Kaufman's work has always had a streak of comic miserablism running through it, his earlier movies are so creative and original that you feel invigorated by watching them. They're consistently delightful, and in the case of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" even profound.",/review/rw1955198/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2008,jimpyke,10," visionary, personal, deeply affecting

28 May 2009,Spleen,1," Kaufman presents a dead bird

24 November 2008,st-shot,3," Life sucks then you die theme at it's most labored and pretentious.
","Films about conflicted artists in free fall can make for some compelling cinema. Fellini and Bergman were masters at conveying this in films such as 8 1/2 and Persona. Sad and distressing as the storyline might be they avoided alienating the audience with stunning visuals and dialogue that contributed to well metered pacing. In this arduous just over two seems like four hour tortured artist tale writer, director Charlie Kaufman drags the audience through one of the biggest downers in ages that is merit-less in every way save for the remarkable performance of Seymour Philip Hoffman as the hapless but revered theatre director with a disastrous personal life, Caden Cotard.",/review/rw1955198/?ref_=tt_urv
