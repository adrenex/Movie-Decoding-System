","Beauty and the Beast is without a doubt one of Disney's finest classics. The first animated film to ever be nominated for best picture and after you see it, you could understand and agree with it's nomination. Beauty and the Beast is going to be one of those films that will always be remembered, I know that it's a movie that I will show my children one day. It has unbelievably terrific animation, a beautiful story, lovable characters, and is just over all a perfect movie. I really love this film so much, I don't think anyone couldn't fall in love with it.",/review/rw1782294/?ref_=tt_urv

","Indeed, it's a tale as old as time, with a complex message that is as ageless as it is universal; but beneath all the layers it can be summed up very simply:  love one another, and refrain from judging others who `seem' to be `different.'  And leave it to Disney to present it in such a way that it can be embraced and understood by young and old alike as they have here, in one of their best animated features ever, `Beauty and the Beast,' directed by Gary Trousdale.  When a young Prince fails the test of an enchantress disguised as an old hag, she transforms him into a hideous beast, as he is destined to remain until he opens his heart and learns how to love and be loved in return.  And so that he'll know where he stands as time goes by, she gives him an enchanted rose, which will bloom until his twenty-first birthday, and he has only until the last petal falls from the flower to effect the change within himself that will be his salvation.

27 March 2005,bob the moo,," Classy piece of animation
","When an arrogant Prince turns away an old woman looking for shelter with only a rose for a gift, she warns him not to just take the surface appearance as being the all of a person; however he rejects her a second time Â– only for her to reveal herself as a beautiful enchantress. She casts a spell on him, turning him into a beast with the only hope of return being to fall in love with a woman and have her fall in love with him before the rose wilts and dies. Resembling a carpet stuffed with walnuts, the prince figures he has no chance and withdraws into his castle. When an elderly man wanders into the castle, the Beast holds him prisoner and only lets him go when his daughter, Belle, offers to replace him in the Beast's castle. With time running out, the Beast's staff hope that Belle will be the one to break the curse but the Beast cannot remember how.",/review/rw1782294/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2005,The_Orenda,9," One of Disney's Best!
","Beauty and the Beast is an engaging movie with so much care and beauty fused into its core. Beauty is much more than just an influential animated classic. It is a grand and powerful fable, sugar coated with the best animation effort in a time where CGI was becoming a movie mainstay. In its finest moments, Beauty is a rousing musical, making your head move and getting caught up right in the mix. The score is unforgettable and the characters are so easy to get into. A movie that children and adults alike will love, Disney deserved its Academy Award nominations for creating such a joy.",/review/rw1782294/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is, without a doubt, the best film Disney ever made. Now that's saying a lot, as the studio also made ""Bambi"", ""Little Mermaid"" and many other great films. ""Beauty and the Beast"" represents everything they could do right in a movie. The music is fantastic and couldn't be better (mostly because many of the songs had a great sense of humor), the characters wonderful and the story promoted some of the most wonderful values you could want. Belle is a completely admirable young lady--and I was thrilled that my own daughters could watch her and learn about her strength and integrity. And, the film is fun--yet will also bring a tear to the eye of even the most jaded viewer. Not surprisingly the film was nominated for Best Picture--it's just a shame that an animated film will probably never take home this Oscar. Well worth seeing and owning--a truly great film.",/review/rw1782294/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is without doubt the best animated movie of all time. The artistry was perfect. I was spellbound at the animated sequences to the songs ""Be Our Guest"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" especially. The characters were very well drawn, and because of the dark and colourful backgrounds, the film looked beautiful. The songs are fantastic. Another movie with great songs is ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame""(which has the best beginning to a Disney movie). In fact, all the Alan Menken scores are brilliant, with the exception of Home On The Range, which is one of the weaker Disney efforts. My personal favourites, were the songs I just mentioned, and ""Gaston"" was great fun too. The incidental music was the best in any Disney movie, and that is the same with the other Menken scores. The music in the transformation of the Beast was phenomenal, as well as the animation, and reminded me of the last movement of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, which is really frightening. Another Disney with great incidental music is ""The Lion King"". The story is quite simply one of the best love stories ever, and the characters are wonderful. Belle was voiced beautifully by Paige O'Hara, who has a beautiful singing voice. I love Belle, she is beautiful, clever and strong, and is one of the best Disney characters for those reasons. Gaston was made into a complex villain, and quite narcissistic(great idea Disney). When he was nasty he was quite frightening, and Richard White can really sing. Jerry Orbach and David Ogden Stiers were really entertaining as Lumiere and Cogsworth,(I just love how witty, elegant and debonair Lumiere is) and Angela Lansbury gives a brilliant rendition of the title song. The best voice over was that of the Beast, who was very frightening, and there were some parts that were truly sensitive. Why are some people fussed about him as a human? Remember, true beauty comes from within. In conclusion, an essential to your Disney collection with a very poignant ending. 10/10. Bethany Cox",/review/rw1782294/?ref_=tt_urv

","... and be entertained with 90 minutes of mesmerising fairy tale telling at its very best. Feel as enchanted as the castle and its occupants as your spirits and emotions rise and fall then rise again. Rejoice in the spectacular finale, while relishing the craft of these incredible animators, musicians, writers, their genius and imagination but, above all, let the meaning and the message distil within you - avoid the shallowness of appearance, don't judge a book by its cover, we're all so much more than what we present.",/review/rw1782294/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2006,Lady_Targaryen,9," The most beautiful love story ever told.
","'' The Beauty and The Beast'' is one of the greatest stories ever told and one of the best movies from Disney that I watched in my life. I always identified myself with Belle, the girl who does not belong the place where she is lives and also with a big taste of reading lots of books. Our story takes part in France in 18 century, and our main character Belle is the prettiest girl in the city she lives, being the object of the affection and interest of Gaston, an arrogant man that has the sympathy of the people of the region.(And also considered a big catch for the girls of the city)But Belle is not interested in him and always imagined her life different from the domestic life people always imagine for her.One day, Belle's father, an inventor, was going to sell one of his inventions and lost his ways, being attacked by wild animals and entering in a big dark mansion apparently without a owner. He stays there for a time, but soon the Beast comes up and attacks him,making him a prisoner in his castle.Belle stays worried and goes after her father in the mansion and there she sees the violent and awful beast who locked her father. She then makes a deal: Belle agrees to stay in the dark castle with the horrible beast in return to her father's freedom. But with the time, Belle is going to discover all the magic that is beyond the castle, including the talking objects and even a nice side that the Beast has.",/review/rw1782294/?ref_=tt_urv

","Who can resist this beautiful story? I love the fact that even though Belle hated Beast at first, she saw underneath that he was a kind and gentle soul, and didn't care what he looked like on the outside! And what girl hasn't known a Gaston in their lives? I thought it was so great how he was put in his place! All the voiceovers are amazing, especially Robby Benson as Beast.

15 August 2011,dee.reid,10," An exceptional, beautiful animated film
","Anyone can tell you that 1991's ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed animated film from that year, is a modern-day classic. ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a film I saw throughout my childhood growing up in the '90s (I was six when the film was originally released in 1991), and I often regarded it as just another Disney fairy tale movie.",/review/rw1782294/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2005,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,10," Delightful Disney romance
","BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, in my opinion, is a delightful Disney romance. If you ask me, Gaston (voice of Richard White) was truly diabolical. Still, in my opinion, he was very good-looking. On the other hand, the songs were truly superior. Well, despite the fact that every song in this film was good, I would have to say that the title song was the best. This was probably be because she did most of the singing. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say everyone involved in delightful Disney romance to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",/review/rw1782294/?ref_=tt_urv

","You know, two of the best aspects of Disney's version of Beauty & the Beast, seemed small and insignificant to most, but have stuck with me since I saw this in 1991. #1 They freely admit that this is a ""tale as old as time"" â€“ they're not hiding that fact and #2 they're also completely up front with stating ""she's the one"" to break the curse, i.e. they don't make us wait until the end (LIKE MOVIES DO ALL THE TIME) to reveal what we've known from minute one. I respect that.",/review/rw1782294/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2016,ElMaruecan82,9," Disney as its most 'classic'... whatever it means...
","Because she was unfairly judged by her horrid looks, an old witch casts a spell on an arrogant prince, turning him into a horrendous beast, and the spell extends to every person working in the castle, turned to the furniture they usually handle in their respective job. The ways of magic are impenetrable in Disney's world. But like any Disney spell, it can be broken if the Prince finds true love: if he's capable to love someone and in return, inspires similar feelings. This is a doomed-to-fail mission as no possible girl could ever love a beast.",/review/rw1782294/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I saw the first advertising for Beauty and the Beast -- a cardboard stand-up in a movie theater -- I nearly burst into tears. Just the ADVERTISEMENT was hauntingly beautiful, tapping into some deep human reality.

","Belle is a beautiful, innocent, intelligent and kind young girl bored with her life in her small village. Her lovable father falls in the clutches of the Beast who is really a handsome prince under a spell. She trades herself for her father's freedom. The Beast agrees. Also the spell on him can be broken if someone loves him--but time is running out. Since this is a Disney film you probably know how it ends.",/review/rw1782294/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2013,OllieSuave-007,10," One of Disney's best, and my favorite.
","This is what I think one of Disney's best animated features, either cartoon short or full-length animated feature film. It is also my favorite Disney movie, about a Beast (an enchanted prince) who has been losing hope to learn to love and be loved in return in order to break the enchanted spell, until he meets Belle. Belle offers to stay in the castle with the Beast in exchange for her imprisoned father to be set free. What follows is a beautiful love story in how Belle attempts to tame the Beast as he learns the proper manners to be a gentleman from her, and attempting to learn to love and be loved in return.",/review/rw1782294/?ref_=tt_urv

","In the opening of Beauty and The Beast, we find out more about the characters in the first five minutes, then many movies tell us in half an hour.  Taking a risk, and opening an animated film with a long musical number was a risky move, but as it turns out, a perfectly wonderful idea. From the opening to the end, we are totally captivated by this wonderful achievement in music and animation as we have never been before.",/review/rw1782294/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2007,stefanbe,10," Like its heroine, Beauty and the Beast steps out of the comfort zone and thus it succeeds magically in taking people off into their hearts and children within.
","It has been said that the pen is mightier than the sword, but when this age-old phrase is converted to modern times, it translates to ""the desktop is mightier than the pencil."" There's no denying that the computer has become a tool used across the world, whether for political reasons, or for business or especially for educational purposes. Computers have also been adopted by the film industry to give their works of art a shinier feel and along with the visual effects wizards, the filmmakers who use these electronic devices the most are the animators. After a while, it was uncertain whether the cel-based animation used to create such classics like The Little Mermaid and Pinocchio would be completely dropped in favour of the quicker and slicker style. While studios like DreamWorks may have given up on them, the folks at the world's pioneering animation studio are still behind the pencil-and-paper animation that has enchanted families for generations. Looking back at one of their essential works, Beauty and the Beast brings back memories of not only nostalgia, but also warmth. Quite possibly the greatest love story ever told, this ""tale as old as time"" has always been told by bringing pen to paper. From its candle-lit beginnings by a French writer many years ago to the Disney animators who brought joys to people of all ages, Beauty and the Beast has always touched the heart.",/review/rw1782294/?ref_=tt_urv
