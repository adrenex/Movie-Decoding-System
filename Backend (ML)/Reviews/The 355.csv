14 July 2017,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," Very enjoyable with a tight script
","I'm not a big fan of these WW-type films, any only decided to watch it as I'm a Brad Pitt fan. Well I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised! The chemistry between Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard was convincing as they played their characters exceptionally. The winner here is the directing and writing - executed perfectly with great cinematography and editing. The pace was a little slow but the excellent ending made up for it! Very enjoyable and it's a 8/10 from me.",/review/rw4032880/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2017,blanche-2,8," I liked it in spite of what everyone else says
","Director Robert Zemeckis gives us some breathtaking moments in ""Allied"" from 2015. The film stars Brad Pitt and Marian Cotillard as Max and Marianne, two spies who meet on a joint assignment in France and fall in love. Mission accomplished, Max proposes. She is allowed to come to England and marry him, and they have a beautiful daughter.",/review/rw4032880/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2016,TheLittleSongbird,6," A wartime romance that could have been epic, but didn't quite make it
","'Allied' has garnered a mixed reaction, on IMDb and with critics in general. This is completely understandable, and the mixed reaction and the reasoning for it mirrors my own feelings for the film. 'Allied' is not a bad film, but from seeing the trailers (which strongly suggested a film that would be more epic, more moving and more thrilling) to be honest was expecting a lot more.",/review/rw4032880/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2016,ferguson-6,6," Keep the emotions real
","Greetings again from the darkness. Every writer, director and actor dreams of being part of the next Casablanca  a timeless movie beloved by so many. It's rare to see such a blatant homage to that classic, but director Robert Zemekis (Oscar winner for Forrest Gump) and writer Steven Knight (Dirty Pretty Things, Eastern Promises) deliver their version with an identical setting, nearly identical costumes, and the re-use of a song (""La Marseillaise"") which played such a crucial role.",/review/rw4032880/?ref_=tt_urv

6 April 2017,robert-temple-1,5," Brad Pitt sleepwalks through an entire film
","This film has a powerful story, many stunning scenes, and Marion Cotillard. But it also has Brad Pitt. Big mistake. Not only does Pitt seem to have had his face worked on, so that it can show little emotion anymore, but he is also apparently not Brad Pitt anymore. Is this a zombie who has taken his place? He plays opposite Marion Cotillard in countless intimate scenes, she tries every device she can think of to wake him up, but still he slumbers. A cardboard cutout of the Brad Pitt we used to know would have been more effective. Considering that this is a film wholly dependent upon the relationship between Pitt and Cotillard, the result is a disaster. The chemistry between them is so far below absolute zero that we are in a deeply frozen universe. Meanwhile, an enormous crew and the director Robert Zemeckis (famous for FORREST GUMP and BACK TO THE FUTURE) struggle to hold back the Red Sea so that the entire cast do not drown in a sea of indifference. We have the excellent Jared Harris, beloved of all MAD MEN fans, adding his resonant voice which is as soothing as hot chocolate, but lacking closeups, so that we can barely see him. We have Gary Sinese, an old chum of Zemeckis. We even have Simon McBurney. But still there is no thaw. We have great scenes. There is sex inside an old car in the middle of a sandstorm in the desert (lacking however any continuity link to the succeeding scenes, which is both an editing and a directing lapse). There is a birth of a baby in the open in the middle of an air raid. There is a man landing on a sand dune by parachute, seen from the air as he descends (astonishing camera work) which is ostensibly in Morocco but was really filmed in the Canary Islands, where all the North African locations were simulated. (There are in any case no such sand dunes near Casablanca, just for the record.) And there is a plane coming straight at a house but which misses its roof by a whisker and crashes across the street. That street is Willow Road in London's Hampstead, where so much action takes place. I could not make out whether the house was meant to be that of my friend Rupert Sheldrake, but I must go have a look at his roof to see whether it is damaged. Later when we see baby Anna taking her first steps, with the wrecked German plane in the background, it is on a hill far from Willow Road, but then this is only a movie. This is a film which should have been fantastic. But it has no pace, it is in fact languid and lingering. It is meant to be a powerful thriller and intense personal drama, but where is the editing to keep it going, where are the intense angles, and above all, where is the hero? Sound asleep, of course. Yes, there are plenty of spectacular setups. Many people worked their butts off giving us great sets, great props, great clothes, wonderful period cars. There are searchlights and anti-aircraft guns slaving away for our benefit, there are Sten guns, Nazis, stern 'V Section' spooks, uniforms, pistols, the whole shebang. But where are the pace, the intensity, and the excitement? All the elements are there, but we wait in vain for it all to move us. This is a passionless film. I also think Steven Knight's screenplay was greatly lacking in any true cinematic sense, and that he is just not a natural writer for the screen, despite having numerous credits. What a waste of a wonderful opportunity this is. And all that money spent on it! Zemeckis rolls scene after scene onstage as if he were producing a variety show in a theatre, or reading from Steven Knight's shopping list, and expects them all to adhere. But they are episodic rather than unified. We go from one outstanding setup to another. But we do not do so quickly enough, there is not enough glue, and above all, the nearest thing to a meaningful Pitt which we see in this film, vaguely and in the distance, are the ones on Jared Harris's face, remembered from MAD MEN, where we all learned to find them endearing marks of his individuality. Marion Cotillard deserves an Oscar for trying. But she might as well be kissing a film poster, and even a rag doll would be more responsive to her embraces. All of her plentiful allure is just so much water thrown at the desert sands, disappearing instantly and leaving no trace. If one pretends all the flaws are not there, one can still just about enjoy this film because of its dramatic and tragic story. But its lack of vigour just makes it look so contrived.",/review/rw4032880/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2018,sddavis63,9," A Wartime Tragedy
","The pacing of ""Allied"" could be called into question - mostly because what you really have here are three stories in one, each with a very different feel, although the thread that holds the movie together runs through all three. The first is the story of the attack by the French Resistance on the German Ambassador in Casablanca, in Vichy-French held Morocco. The story opens with Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) - a Canadian officer working ifor British intelligence who's sent in to take part in the attack. He meets up with Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard) - a member of the Resistance who's leading the attack. This part of the story was pretty fast paced and exciting. It leads in to the second story - a love story between Max and Marianne. They fall in love, and he takes her with him to London, where they marry and have a daughter and spend a couple of years living together in obvious domestic bliss. The story slows down here, befitting the new tone, and helps to flesh out the two characters. The domestic bliss is interrupted by the third part of the story, when the British come to believe that Marianne is actually a German spy, and if they can prove it Max is told that he'll be ordered to kill her. So the movie becomes a sort of suspense-drama. Is she or isn't she? And there's reason to believe either. In a sense these are three very different stories, but I thought they were woven together pretty well and made a movie that was both enjoyable and interesting to watch. Pitt and Cotillard both gave good performances. Marianne was a social animal who liked people and parties, and Max was more of a quiet loner who kept his emotions very much in check, and both actors captured those personalities. The two worked very well together. ",/review/rw4032880/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2018,imseeg,7," Very entertaining suspenseful and romantic world war II espionage drama.
","""Allied"" is sometimes a bit slick and sentimental. Never too much though, but it shows that it is still a hollywood production. The acting is somewhat stiff at times. Those are my only 2 complaints, because overall this movie is very suspenseful and that suspense keeps this movie thrilling till the very end. But ""Allied"" needs a long build up. So please be patient, because there will come several very interesing plot turns, which take the movie into a totally different direction then I could have suspected.",/review/rw4032880/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2016,TheMovieDiorama,8," Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard join forces, to make a decent romance.
","The usual November World War II film, this year we have Allied which is all about an undercover couple who eventually marry each other but a certain obstacle is thrown their way...British intel believes that the wife is actually a German spy. Is the intel wrong? Is it love over honour? Well you'll have to watch to find out for yourself, but I do recommend you do so as this is a good old fashioned romance, with a hint of spy thrills. I must advise that you do go in expecting a romance, the trailers did market this as a thriller/action...it is not. Right, firstly let's get the obvious out of the way and say that Marion Cotillard once again steals the film. She really is a class act. She is able to capture emotion through her face and not many actors can do that (plus we finally get to see her speak a lot of French which is great for her). Brad Pitt was great, although essentially used to be the bankable star and to get viewers to watch the film (ignoring the current affairs of his love life), he could've been replaced by anyone. Due to the old fashioned style, this needs a great director and who better than Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Castaway and Flight). He is so confident and has such a fascinating nostalgic way of using the camera. Such good camera placement particularly during a scene that involves mirrors from a wardrobe to show a different character...very clever and I admire that. The script however was hit or miss. At times I felt that the script was captivating, I definitely became invested in the couple and cared for what happens to them. The only problem is, there are several scenes which do not add to the story and actually creates pacing issues for itself which is a shame. Admittedly I'm not a huge fan of WWII period dramas but the production and overall environment for the film was excellent, I couldn't fault it. I won't spoil the ending but it did touch me and it was beautifully handled (although my partner actually did shed a tear, maybe I am emotionless after all). Overall, Allied was a decent romantic period drama with an incredible performance from Cotillard and outstanding direction from Zemeckis, although the script had inconsistent pacing.",/review/rw4032880/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2016,RLTerry1,7," Duplicitous and Suspenseful!
","Quite the duplicitous plot! Robert Zemeckis' Allied released by Paramount Pictures is a thrilling tale of espionage and love. We have certainly seen a few different ""spy"" movies over the last couple of years; some more about espionage and others more about the drama that ensues afterwards. Fortunately, Allied feels like a genuine spy movie that actually contains espionage. The production design and costumes are a beautiful throwback to the fabulous 40s. You'll find yourself reaching for a glass of champagne and swing dancing to Benny Goodman's timeless big band jazz hit Sing, Sing, Sing. There is one city synonymous with WWII, espionage, and romance and you will appropriately return to that iconic city of Casablanca in Allied. This is definitely not a reimagined Casablanca but there are indirect references to that movie sprinkled throughout this new story. Films like this one require top notch talent, and both Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard deliver outstanding performances to accompany this staple in film genres. Not limited to the love story between Pitt's and Cotillard's respective characters, the movie also includes some deadly shootout scenes and dangerously close encounters with the Nazis behind enemy lines.",/review/rw4032880/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2016,cschultz-2,3," Casablanca It Ain't
","The Academy Award-winning 1942 motion picture Casablanca has become a legend of filmmaking, almost a part of folklore, by being as perfect a movie as is possible. A triumph of cohesion, not a scene or a line of dialogue is wasted—every single word and frame of film points to the climactic scene in which most of the the cast is present, all plot lines are resolved, and all the picture's mysteries solvedand which many film fans have memorized and can recite, word-for-word.

","My husband and I both enjoyed this movie. It had been a while since we had seen Brad Pitt in a movie and he is an accomplished actor. His costar was beautiful and talented. They made for good eye candy as a couple. There was plenty of action across two different settings and times. It was not predictable or spelt out for you which is often the case with American movies, The English seem to do a better job of allowing the audience to fill in some gaps and silences.

",What an enjoyable WW2 movie. The tone and content of this movie is a right step in the direction of having the story and characters at the forefront in a Hitchcock way vs the violence of battle. There have been enough gut wrenching war movies concentrating on big battles and close ups on injuries so this is a refreshing change of perspective. Some action type WW2 movies have been getting ridiculous in recent years.

","Robert Zemeckis has helmed a film that is in every respect worthy of his formidable talent and illustrious filmography. With him in the director's chair, Allied's great production values were more or less expected. The film offers beautiful costuming inspired by Casablanca and Now, Voyager, exhilarating action scenes helped by a protagonist who I see as a humanized James Bond, and a very well-told, poignant story of happiness despite a world gone mad.

14 January 2018,mrharrypaulson,5," Something about Zemeckis
","I always thought of Robert Zemeckis as a hit or miss director. I hated Beowulf but I loved Death Becomes Her for instance. Allied falls right in the middle. An old fashion WWII drama and when I say old fashion I mean, musty, tired. Mr and Mrs Smith territory but with the major plus of Marion Cottillard. She is wonderful. Brad Pitt, who I love, looked like a special effect and being in a Robert Zemeckis movie I thought that he might be. Very strange. The simple premise of discovering that your spouse is not who you thought she was, opens a world of dramatic opportunities but there is something about Robert Zemeckis that makes me think he doesn't really care about the human interaction, no. he seems, always, much more focus in the special effects. Allies is no exception and in fact it has a couple of breathtaking visual coups. Unfortunately the actual drama left me completely cold.",/review/rw4032880/?ref_=tt_urv
