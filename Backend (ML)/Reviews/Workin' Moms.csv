","They have you terrified at what was going to come out of someones mouth in just about every scene. I dont know if I liked it or hated it. I appreciated they made Me squirm for a couple hours. But now I think I need to wash it down with like, i dont know, a disney movie lol or something. The people, every last one of them are seriously messed up in the head. Brace yourself to be pushed in the incredibly uncomfortable zone. Should have a warning, ""written by some one with psycological issues""",/review/rw3862565/?ref_=tt_urv

",It takes a Greek director — Yorgos Lanthimos — to revive the elemental power of Greek tragedy in a modern setting. ,/review/rw3862565/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2018,Cineanalyst,5," Iphigenia in Aulis
","What a strange filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos is. Had I not already seen ""The Lobster"" (2015) (and have since seen two of his earlier Greek productions), I probably would've been completely taken aback by this one, ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer."" Like its predecessor, its characters seem to occupy some alternate reality entirely dominated by egocentrism, deviant sex and magical retaliatory justice. Again, the acting is intentionally stilted, and there seem to be archaic literary references. I found the eye-for-an-eye pun of ""The Lobster"" amusing, but the source of Ancient-to-Classical Greek mythology here is quite a treat for me. At university, I took a class, not unlike the daughter in this movie, that included reading the play ""Iphigenia in Aulis"" by Euripides and, then, viewing the 1977 film adaptation ""Iphigenia"" directed by Mihalis Kakogiannis. Unfortunately, the result in ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" is rather muddled.",/review/rw3862565/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2020,TxMike,," Modern take on a Greek myth.
","I went into watching this with no background and it is strange from the start, the stilted dialog and unusual responses characters often give. The title threw me until I read later that one version of the Greek myth requires the killing of a sacred deer to get the gods to help.",/review/rw3862565/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2017,claudio_carvalho,3," Weird, Intriguing but Absolutely Disappointing and Overrated
","The renowned heart surgeon Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) is married with Dr. Anna Murphy (Nicole Kidman) with two children, the young teenager Kim (Raffey Cassidy) and the boy Bob (Sunny Suljic) that are their pride and joy. He works with the anesthetist Matthew (Bill Camp) and recently he is dedicating attention to the teenager Martin (Barry Keoghan), whose father died in a surgery. Steven brings Martin to meet his family and the teenager invites him to have dinner at his home with his mother (Alicia Silverstone), who harasses Steven. He rejects and on the next day, Bob gets sick without walking. Steven and Anna bring Bob to the hospital and after a complete checkup, the doctors do not find any problem with the boy. Soon Martin meets Steven and tells that he killed his father; now he has to kill Anna or Kim or Bob; otherwise they will all get sick and die. Who is Martin?",/review/rw3862565/?ref_=tt_urv

11 December 2021,Her-Excellency,8," Misunderstood
","This is definitely not one for everyone and that's okay, sure, but to assign it a 1-star or 2-star rating as some have done, is just ridiculous, especially when the disconnect certainly is on the side of the viewer. In fact, those who deemed the acting 'bad' (one reviewer notes: ""I thought the characters were robots"") missed the entire point of the film.",/review/rw3862565/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2018,PaxtonMalloy,2," Fed up with this kind of movies

",This is one of those movies I have nothing nice to say about. The only thing I'll hand this movie is that I don't want to blame the actors/actresses. They've all shown that they have talent and I believe they were all instructed to act in such a robotic and monotone style. This obviously backfired as I couldn't attach myself to their characters because of it but I get the intention. My hope is that they all bounce back soon with other more worthwhile projects.,/review/rw3862565/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2018,Leofwine_draca,1," Hugely pretentious
","One of the most pretentious films I can remember seeing in a long while, THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER tries to be a family-centred psycho thriller but instead turns out to be a long-winded and interminable bore. The film stars Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman as a married couple whose lives are ruined when a strange and obnoxious boy comes into their lives and makes them a deathly ultimatum. The plot's okay in itself, but not when things are dragged out to this interminably slow length. The worst thing about the movie by far is the direction, from a Greek chap who couldn't direct traffic, let alone a proper movie. Every single scene is distracted by his stupid camera tricks, with slow zooms in and out being particular favourites. The film is icy, cold, and has no heart at all, and at times there's blaring noise on the soundtrack that just annoys you. Farrell and Kidman do nothing with their underwritten parts while Barry Keoghan is no more than one-dimensional as the supposed antagonist. It's the kind of awful viewing experience that never seems to end.",/review/rw3862565/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2018,mr_iceman,2," The Killing of the Sacred Brain
","It's been a while since I've written a review for a movie, however I felt compelled to do so with this trash-fest given it consumed 2 hours of my night. The first 15 minutes of the movie starts off well, you're introduced to a high profile surgeon, a great family and an unexplained relationship with an annoying boy with various forms of autism and long list of deficiencies. From that point on-wards, the movie dips like a car without brakes. The director proceeds to introduce us to awkward and unnecessary sexual encounters from 'laying-dead' fetishes to rapid hand-jobs, ",/review/rw3862565/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2017,fewsternoble,1," Total waste of time
","I really don't know where to begin with this, it's such a BAD movie.
The acting is, well, wierd from the off, like they are reading from a book, literally.
I thought that with the stars in this movie and the ratings it received it would be a sure fire hit in our household. How wrong i was, i really don't know what the other reviewers of this were thinking, to give this a 7 or 8 you must of seen another movie by mistake.
After and hour i thought we should be watching something else but, the wife said ""no"" lets stick with it, it may be good. At the end i asked her what she thought, ""absolute rubbish"".
This isnt a classic in any way, shape, or form, please please please stay away, it is definately 2 hours you won't get back.",/review/rw3862565/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2018,jburtonprod-802-759029,1," I Really Hope Yorgos Lanthimos is Never Allowed to Make Another Movie.
","There is so much wrong with movie it's really difficult to know where to start. The director is trying so hard to be an 'auteur' it's really painful to watch. This movie actually chokes on it's own pretentiousness. There are also images that suggest a preoccupation with necrophilia and the movie isn't even centered around that. There's an anesthesiologist who is willing to violate his oath for the most pitiful and unerotic hand job in the history of hand jobs. I don't care if it's being done by a grim Nicole Kidman or not, I don't see the up side. The premise is absolutely absurd, that some kid could poison two children, have the mother and father know about it, have the crack medical team at a major hospital not be able to do anything bout it and not have the police yank the cure out of the kid's asshole, metaphorically speaking. The movie is incredibly cruel toward children, it's basic core is built around that, if that gives an idea what you are signing up for with this turd fest. ",/review/rw3862565/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2018,kosmasp,9," Weird alternate reality
","Dialog is going to be weird. Suffice to say that you won't feel anything close to something familiar. The movie is way off and if you are familiar with the work of the director this will not come as a surprise. Obviously for some this was the first experience with him. And it can be intimidating and rather confusing. There are certain rules that are there and even the structure is quite ""normal"", but other than that ... all bets are off.",/review/rw3862565/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2019,mgd_m,1," Deeply flawed travesty
","The problem with this movie is not the boredom or the robotic acting. The problem is it has no climax. When the ending comes, you don't feel anything. It's so dull, you just say ""ok"", while you should cry watching what's happening.
Another big flaw is that the moral (""everyone of us is ready to do the most nefarious things to save his own life"") is told in a very obvious, didactic way, such as ""here it is, here's your moral"". There's no enlightment in it, just a boring lesson.
Third mortal sin, is that there's no real choice to be made in the movie. Everything feels driven, the antagonist is unbeatable, so... I don't know, there's no purpose in this story at all.",/review/rw3862565/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2020,classicsoncall,6," ""Here it is. That time is now.""
","Ahh, so this is the same director that brought us ""The Lobster""; somehow I'm not surprised. I read a few dozen reviews of the movie posted here on IMDb, and of course a lot of them state how absurd the story is. Of those that commented favorably however, they seemed to attach some credibility to the events that occurred in the picture. That's where my criticism of the film actually lies. First off, it's undeniable that the film starts out with an oddly creepy vibe. The relationship between Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) and Martin (Barry Keoghan) is shrouded in some kind of mystery that the viewer is not privy to. My own sense was that there was an aberrant sexual relationship between the two with all the various allusions made by the characters, like meeting in secret and the gifts bestowed on Martin by the esteemed cardiac surgeon.",/review/rw3862565/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2017,george.schmidt,1," Filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos continues to befuddle and anger audiences in attempting to become a new M.Night Shamalan (um, not a good thing at all)
","THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER (2017) * Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman, Barry Keoghan, Raffey Cassidy, Sunny Suljic, Bill Camp, Alicia Silverstone. Odd, strange and frankly taxing on the nerves sci-fi drama about the very wrong relationship between a teenage loner (creepy as f*** Keoghan) who gloms onto the cardiologist (Farrell in a truly one-note you wanna slap so-hard turn) who was responsible in the death of his father on the operating table unbeknownst to the doctor (at first) until it is revealed that the fate of his family will suffer the wrath of the mysterious boy. Filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos - who co-wrote the frustrating screenplay with Efthymis Filippou - continues to befuddle and anger audiences in attempting to become a new M.Night Shamalan (um, not a good thing at all) - with impossible silent situations and moments where you want to scream at the screen ""Are you ****ing kidding me?!!?"" An attempt at a parable from the darkest recesses of The Twlight Zone comes off more as a metaphor of ego and revenge.",/review/rw3862565/?ref_=tt_urv
