","""The Starling"" is not a comedy, but a film for viewers to feel that characters' pain and grief. It is a nice surprise to see how the comedians could portray these deep feelings effectively.",/review/rw7474345/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,classicsoncall,7," ""I just need a minute to figure out what happens next.""
","Netflix has this film listed under their Comedy titles, but that's not even remotely close to accurate. There are some humorous moments, but mostly it's a poignant and heart rending story of a couple who lose their infant child to SIDS, and the recrimination each of the partners feel in terms of guilt and remorse. Jack Maynard (Chris O'Dowd) goes so far as to attempt suicide, while his wife Lilly (Melissa McCarthy) is left behind to pick up the pieces of her shattered life when he enters a treatment facility. Slowly but gradually, both begin to heal under the patient guidance of their respective counselors, but with the expected challenges one would encounter under such trying circumstances. I thought the aspect of the starling to be somewhat odd with it's inclusion in the story, though it serves as a focal point for Lilly's desire to face life head on again, especially after the guilt brought on by trying to intentionally kill it for invading her garden and dive bombing her presence. Kevin Kline delivers a surprisingly humanistic turn as the former psychologist turned veterinarian who helps Lilly move forward. After seeing Timothy Olyphant in series like ""Justified"" and ""Deadwood"", he seemed strangely out of place here as the manager of a Wally's department store, but thankfully, his appearance was more like a pair of cameos. Forget about the film's questionable comedy designation, and prepare for an emotional and thoughtful journey of a couple finding their way back to each other from a grief we would all find unbearable.",/review/rw7474345/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2021,ops-52535,9," its a lovely...
","Piece of filmaking and a lovable way of storytelling en masse'. I guess some people will have great difficulties reading the symbology of this relationship drama, but it is there somewhere hidden or displayed by the wonderful acts of kevin kline( i was in the ''life as a house'' mode when watching) and melissa macharthy( who has the physical and behavioural demeanors like my wife), making this sad and complicated story of life become a warm and friendly corner of the world.",/review/rw7474345/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2021,studioginger,8," You can't judge the book by the cover
","A very different movie for what you can expect from the cast, but it does not mean that it is s a bad movie, the comedy drama movies are the most difficult to play right, but if you really want to see this movie properly, you will realise that it is very deep and full emotions.... And also once in a while.. Funny too...
Because every rose comes with a few spikes and fragrances.......
Just enjoy the characters and stop moaning about what you expected... That is pointless.",/review/rw7474345/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2021,jk-692-236394,8," Well done and not a downer either.
",This movie was well done. All the parts were played well. It was nice to see Kevin Kline. This movie gets the tone right of grieving and depression and trying to move forward. I have not had this loss in my life. I was moved by the movie and found it hopeful and uplifting. I liked the whole movie.,/review/rw7474345/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2021,Mars-3038,10," A heartfelt gem
","This is a realistic portrayal of grief, of losing a love one. I thought it was wonderfully made and definitely deserves a much higher rating!!",/review/rw7474345/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,paul_haakonsen,7," Quite a nice surprise this one...
","""The Starling"" is definitely not your average run-of-the-mill comedy from actress Melissa McCarthy. And I have to admit that when I sat down to watch this 2021 Netflix comedy drama then I was expecting it to be another archetypical McCarthy comedy.",/review/rw7474345/?ref_=tt_urv

",Melissa Mcarthy did it again! She played a beautiful and funny role! This whole movie had me laughing and crying at the same time!,/review/rw7474345/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2021,merril444,9," Great, emotional movie
",Anyone who has experienced grief can relate to this movie. The characters are disconnected & lost as they try to come to terms with loss & moving forward.,/review/rw7474345/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2021,ravencorinncarluk,8," An honest story about grief and loss....
","...but I think you might have needed to experience a close loss for this movie to really speak to you. I was deeply touched, but both my husband and I have experienced deaths close to us, so I was able to really connect and share the catharsis.",/review/rw7474345/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2021,getbacks,9," Solid movie.
",The critics pan this movie because it doesn't follow the regimented crap that's out there.,/review/rw7474345/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2021,flowertimezones,8," Beautiful story
",Beautiful story of dealing with loss and grief and breaking out of the bubble we form to shut out the pain. Heartfelt moments show us how difficult it is to process pain and how we need to allow others (human or otherwise) to help see our world differently. Comedic moments lighten up the difficult issues without taking anything away from central issues.,/review/rw7474345/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2021,marclondon-76265,10," Deserves 10 stars
","Ignore the bad reviews, this movie deserves stars. I don't know why they have bad reviews cause it deserves all the attention to watch . It's about life how we deal with pain with depression. It's is shot in slow motion and the music the picture all in harmony of soul. The acting was so good.",/review/rw7474345/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2021,juanmuscle,10," It was nice!
","I loved the acting and the bird! And I loved the way we get to find out things about the characters, one of the lines hit me hard, when ol' boy was in group and he made a startling discovery about his life! Quite vivid and ethereal, it was very difficult to watch cause it made me want to cry at times but that is all right! I loved and Melissa and everyone involved in this thing should be very proud of themselves for doing something challenging especially in this sparse medium bereft of a hardcore indefatigable exhaustive narrative that prose can furnish! But they were able to do a lot with their gestures and physiognomy! Amazing job , keep up the great work!",/review/rw7474345/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2021,Sandra-durand80,10," What an amazing movie

",I'm so glad I ignored the 5.8 star rating and watched this. It was exactly what I felt like watching and I cried a bit and laughed a bit and just really enjoyed this movie.,/review/rw7474345/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2021,canderson2,10," Worth watching.
","Loved this movie. Having lost a child, I understood maybe more than someone who has not lost a child. Really do not understand the negative reviews that claimed the movie was lacking in feeling, had bad acting, and that didn't seem to understand the bird. It made total sense to me and I thought the acting by the major players was wonderful, especially Melissa McCarthy. Any one who has lost a child should take away some thing from the Starling.",/review/rw7474345/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2021,nancyhotz,8," Wonderful

23 October 2021,denise-882-139023,9," Deep love on show.
","The film is about love and loss. Having lost their baby to SIDS ( Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) , the film shows the strain on those who give up and those who do not know how to.",/review/rw7474345/?ref_=tt_urv
