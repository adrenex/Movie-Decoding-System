15 July 2004,Chromium_5,," The most unrealistic--and awesome--cop show of all time.
","This show was so much fun, I don't even know where to begin. I loved it as a kid, and I still love it now when I see it in reruns... only now it seems hilariously hokey, which makes it even better.",/review/rw2570295/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2006,Gafaddict,7," The ""Snakes on a Plane"" of Television
","Yes, the acting is horrendously bad. Yes, the dialog is unbelievably cheesy and stale. Yes, the plots are unoriginal and don't make sense. But damn it, when was the last time that we were able to just turn on the television, sit back and enjoy the action without having to deal with some over-the-top action/drama that goes way too fast and shoves some moral lesson on life in our faces? That's what makes Walker Texas Ranger so enjoyable -- it really recreates the feel of those classic Westerns that used to be on all the time back in the '50s. So horrendously bad that it's great to watch when you just need some time to unwind and forget about everything else. And you've gotta admit, it paved way for a great comedy segment on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. I know I'll still be watching this for years to come.",/review/rw2570295/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2006,rcj5365,," A Saturday Night Powerhouse
","This was a show that was rocky at first when it debuted in 1993, but turned out a perennial powerhouse every Saturday evening from the astounding eight seasons that it ran on CBS-TV. From the premiere episode on April 21,1993 to the final episode of the series on May 19,2001,the series ""Walker,Texas Ranger"" was one of the best action shows to ever come out of the 1990's and for good reason. This was a show that had a mixture to it...taking the elements of a modern-day traditional Western,add in some high flying martial arts action with some impressive karate action and spectacular action sequences with a little of modern-day issues thrown in for good measure. This show had it all and then some...high flying action and adventure with breathtaking sequences adding in some of Chuck Norris' sensational moves for dealing with the baddies who wreck havoc each week. The series,""Walker,Texas Ranger"",was part ""MacGuyer"",part ""Miami Vice"",and part ""Walking Tall"",with a hint of David Carradine's TV-western ""Kung Fu"" for grand measure. Not to mention it was part,""Wild,Wild,West"" too which by the way took a cue from Robert Conrad and Ross Martin. The show ran for an astounding eight seasons on CBS and produced over 203 episodes,when goes to show you it is still very popular as a solid performer in syndicated repeats of the episodes where they are being run continuously on either the USA Network or The Hallmark Channel on a daily basis and in syndicated stations across the country.",/review/rw2570295/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2006,xredgarnetx,8," Unbelievable, but in a good way
","You pick your favorite episode and I'll pick mine. I just watched the episode where Walker helps run a karate school for disadvantaged kids and earnestly works to keep one particular kid from becoming a gangbanger. The acting couldn't be worse, the dialog is atrocious (""My little sister was killed in a drive-by shooting so I put my purple belt in her coffin""), the blocking and even the action are all third-rate. Instead of immediately taking down the bad boys near the end, Norris challenges the entire gang (all 50 of them) to a fistfight -- which he naturally wins, and handily, I might add. Then and only then does his backup posse move in to make the arrest. The whole thing is made of moldy cardboard and cheese. And yet...it works. Norris the Most Wooden Indian of Actors since Charlie Bronson clearly cares about the subject, and it shows. The gangbanger stuff is cartoonish but true enough at its core, even if most of the gangbangers on screen are right out of ""West Side Story,"" and there is a touching dedication to what I assume was a real-life dead gangbanger at the end. The footage of real street kids in a real karate class is heart-tugging, even when two young gangbangers show up at the 11th hour and haltingly ask if they may join the class. The message is loud and clear: no drugs, no gangs. Of course, Norris plays the Great White Hope and it is only because of his efforts that these poor Mexican-American kids ever see the light. Let it stand. The message is heartfelt. I'd say show this episode in schools, except the kids would probably laugh at it. For one thing, no blood. Plenty of shootings and violent fighting, but no blood. No one dies, either. Or not that I know of. If any of the gangbangers buy the farm after being shot, the episode does not make this clear. The focus is on the running down and subsequent recovery of Walker's bar owner buddy plus the drive-by shooting and recovery of a very clean-cut adult Mexican-American who runs a garage and was a former gangbanger whom Walker turned around. Natch. Oddly enough, Walker's longtime partner and constant companion Trivett spends all but the last 30 seconds of this episode in or near their office. Walker goes solo for reasons best understood by the scripters. Maybe the actor playing Trivett was sick or injured during the episode's shooting. I wish I had never found out Norris wears a rug. It is all too evident in this episode, and quite distracting as it is a mullet job. Norris wore much shorter and far less obtrusive rugs in the final years of the series.",/review/rw2570295/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2021,hines-2000,10," Running to watch Walker!
","I must have seen every show in the 90s. Now I watch reruns every chance I get. Chuck Norris was a champion in real life and he was number one with Walker. Walker was brought up as a Cherokee with the name of Wa-sho and many episodes featured his Native American family. What better man to play James Trivette than Air Force Academy man Clarence Gilyard Jr and his best friend is costar beautiful Sheree J. Wilson. Interestingly, the only Texas man in the main cast was Noble Willingham. He was really the heart and soul of this show. However, every scene in Walker was a command performance.",/review/rw2570295/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2006,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,9," A pure CBS hit!
","This show, in my opinion, is a pure CBS hit! Despite the fact that I've never seen every episode, I still enjoyed it. There are many episodes that I enjoyed. One of them was where Walker (Chuck Norris) and Alex (Sheree J. Wilson) got married. If you want to know why, you'll have to have seen it for yourself. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, even though it can be seen on USA now, I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good.",/review/rw2570295/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2006,bassbonediva,10," Kick butt action-adventure the whole family can enjoy!
","It was a sad day in my house when this series aired its farewell episode. It was a ritual for my dad and I to sit down every Saturday night and watch Walker, Texas Ranger. I was teased endlessly in high school for being a Chuck Norris fan, but this series made it all worth it. I got my weekly dose of uncynical, clean-languaged action and got to laugh at the sometimes too-good-to-be-true situations. It was nice to have a show out there that didn't feel like it had to use foul language and sexual innuendos every ten seconds to appeal to their audience. I love Chuck Norris' multi-cultural character and the way he mixes Native American wisdom with kick-butt martial arts. Clarence Gilyard's character, James Trivette, was perfectly cast. No one I have talked to could imagine anyone but Clarence Gilyard playing Trivette. He was good in Matlock, but he was sensational in Walker, Texas Ranger. Noble Willingham made for a perfect CD Parker--in fact, he reminded me more than once of my Uncle Jimmy. Sheree J Wilson could not have been cast more perfectly as Assistant DA Alex Cahill, Walker's courtroom nemesis at first, then later his love interest. My favorites, though, have to be the later addition of Judson Mills as Francis Gage and Nia Peeples as Sydney Cooke. Could there have been any more romantic tension between those two?!?!? Judson Mills added a certain almost school-boy charm when it came to bantering with Sydney and Nia Peeples was perfect in the way she let Gage know he was utterly clueless when it came to women. My dad used to say ""You know, you can only take so many boots to the face before you just don't get up anymore and I think Walker has exceeded his limit."" I was sad to see this show end, but I'm glad that USA Network and the Hallmark Channel air reruns of it, even though they are mostly older episodes from the early '90's.",/review/rw2570295/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2011,MN-Troy,9," There is a Walker in all of us
","The year was 1993 and there was darkness across television. Chuck Norris appeared and decreed: ""let there be a show starring myself as a Texas Ranger named Walker."" Now there was show called Walker Texas Ranger. And that is how the show got started. Chuck Norris did not have to persuade CBS to broadcast his program; he simply demanded it and it was done. Thus begins my wonderful journey into the kingdom of Walker Texas Ranger.",/review/rw2570295/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2009,bennymelman,10," Awesome TV series
","Now, I am not from the times when Walker was on. i'm only 10, Walker Texas Ranger finished when I was only a toddler. but watching the re-runs of the show, i can tell that is awesome, exciting and sometimes even funny! Walker always wins, he rarely gets hurt in the fights. Best TV series I ever seen! OK, here's the way the show goes: Ranger Cordele Walker- (Chuck Norris) is a Texas ranger partnered with a younger ranger named Jimmy Trivette- (Clarence Gilyard Jr) and the episodes usually begin with a crime scene and then you see the rangers at their office when they hear about the crime. they go out and find the bad guy. a while later, they plan a showdown, and Walker goes with Trivette in their truck, finds the bad guy and beats him up. after that, the rangers reunite or something, then the episode ends. the show is super! i strongly recommend it, Chuck Norris kicks butt. 10/10",/review/rw2570295/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2006,frank4122,10," World class karate, World class series
","Ten of ten stars with a bullet, to the bad guys that is. Walker Texas Ranger is a great series. Thanks to USA you can still see it every week. Chuck Norris is a bona fide world karate champion and left as a world champion. He did the same with Walker. The cast is brilliant. I always feel like they are part of my family. Clarence Gilyard as Jimmy Trivette is always there when you need him, but provides just the right suspense. In the back of your mind you always think it might not work out for the Rangers this time. Sheree Wilson as DA Alex Chahill is the perfect girlfriend and later,wife. I'd love to see the wedding on DVD. Noble Willingham, Judson Mills and Nia Peeples all play great supporting roles. CD'Big Dog'Parker gives the Rangers that age old wisdom for their modern day problems. As for Cage and Sydney, they are everyone's favorite unmarried couple. Always the underlying romantic tension while they beat the bad guys with some great karate of their own. Just a wonderful series with many life lessons. I wasn't hooked at the beginning, but now it's like a ritual. I finally get it.",/review/rw2570295/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2001,MichaelM24,," nine seasons of pure entertainment
","I never saw WALKER, TEXAS RANGER when it first started. In fact, I don't think I started watching regularly until around the third season or so. But thanks to reruns, I've been able to catch up on the ones I missed while viewing the new ones as they were made. I can recall many Saturdays where we probably annoyed the neighbors as my family and I sang along with the theme song. One of the reasons I enjoyed the show was because it always reminded me of a western. When Walker drives up in his Dodge Ram, I can imagine him riding up on a horse. The gunfights are like an Old West shootouts, and the bar fights would be at home in any saloon in any old western town. Though I didn't particularly like how the character was toned down over the seasons (in the early years, he'd just cut loose on the bad guys, while in the later years he sometimes tried to avoid a conflict, and fight as a last resort), I never lost interest. WALKER is also one of the few shows were I loved all the characters. The comic interplay between C.D. and Trivette was always good, as well the chemistry between Chuck Norris and Clarence Gilyard. When Norris announced his plans to end the show, I was naturally saddened. With THE PRETENDER gone as well, my Saturday nights will be completely empty without any entertainment on television. Fortunately, WALKER lives on in reruns on USA, so I still have the chance to see one of my all-time favorite shows five nights a week. Thanks for nine seasons of pure entertainment, Chuck.",/review/rw2570295/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2010,ghostridersmc,10," A truly excellent series.
","Walker: Texas Ranger was without a doubt an excellent series, as someone who works in law enforcement I can say that the show is nothing like real life but that is not its purpose, it is not meant to be taken seriously it is simply meant to be pure entertainment, action and drama often with an important message as well, the series was certainly a great one and I'm my opinion it ended all too soon, I didn't always have a chance to see it when it was on TV so I purchased the entire series on DVD back on 08/01/2010 and finally finished watching it on 10/04/2010, All the series is worth seeing and in my opinion it had to specific weak points, Cordell Walker (Chuck Norris) and James Trivette (Clarence Gilyard Jr.) are great characters and are always interesting on screen, to me they are one of the best pairs since Starsky & Hutch, Alex Cahill (Sheree J. Wilson), C.D. Parker (Noble Willingham), Carlos Sandoval (Marco Sanchez), Trent Malloy (James Wlcek) and all the secondary characters also do a great job and have few if any weak moments, I also liked the addition of Francis Gage (Judson Mills) and Sydney Cooke (Nia Peeples) for the final seasons as they brought a new flavor and presence to the show, I'm also glad the series ended on a strong note instead of waiting until it eventually ran its course and became stale and boring, The Final Show/Down Part 1 & 2 were an excellent way to finish up the series, one thing I really liked about the series was it didn't solely rely on firearms to get the job done but focused on Martial Arts and team work as a much better solution, There are however a number of things in the series that made little sense, for example: Trivette switching from a SIG-Sauer P226 to a Walther P5 which no one in law enforcement would even contemplate doing and being able to defeat numerous opponents in unarmed combat which might work sometimes but no one is capable of winning every single time no matter how good they are.

","The show is more popular after it was cancelled thanks to Conan O'Brien! The over the top antics of Chuck Norris from this show and his movies makes for great comedy for Conan and Chuck Norris jokes. What one learns from Walker Texas Ranger is that Chuck Norris can bull ride, jump on air plane wings from a moving helicopter and many other impossible acts perfectly. My favorite one is Chuck can survive a helicopter rocket attack, have his truck roll 20 times, escape without a scratch, shoot the helicopter down, and beat the villain in a Karate fight. He is the man! The show has many good messages which are anti-drug, self improvement, values etc. The show usually has an antagonist which creates problems which Walker and his crew fix. Conflict is usually solved with a Karate fight. Not a bad rerun show. I give Walker a six out of ten.",/review/rw2570295/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Texas Rangers are about as famous a Police Agency as there ever was or is in this world; being that they are still going strong and have an origin that pre-dates both the Republic of and State of Texas. The other Police Organizations to be fictionalized as often in their league would be: the ""Mounties"" of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police/Northwest Mounted Police (now), Scotland Yard and the somewhat police-type agency of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (the F.B.I.), or as we say in the Police Racket, ""the Bureau.""* All these groups have had many fictionalized accounts of their exploits. But, next to the collective Radio Programs, TV Series and Theatrical Feature Films and Movie Serials featuring the USA's ""Big City"" P.D.'s (New York, L.A., Chicago, San Francisco, Mayberry, etc.), no one has more than the Texas Rangers.

1 November 2006,msbsegal,10," The greatest series of them all Walker, Texas Ranger
","Walker, Texas Ranger is the best series I have watched on TV. For such an expert in martial arts, Walker never boosts of his know-how, keeps his calm and cool at all times. I read many of the comments, and I do not understand the critics : do other law-enforcement series differ ? I have seen other American, British, French, German and Austrian police or detective series, do they begin without some crime and don't the heroes always get the bad evil ones. In 95% of the cases we get the right good and of course expected ending, otherwise it would not be part of this type of series. In what way then does Walker T. R. differ ? Well it is set as part of the community: Chuck Norris in his private life is a concerned citizen fighting drugs etc. This is brought to life in many episodes when he helps poor kids get out of the gangs; he fights the gangs and brings the killers to trial; He gets help from friends, fighters like himself or former gangs members or former convicts to get pupils and students get rid of the drugs vicious circle. And you think yes it is a movie but may be one can learn a lesson and try to copy the movie in real life schools and colleges and get rid of gangs, drugs, drugs dealers etc. Why not try ? I also like very much the episodes with White Eagle and the customs and way of life of the Indians. Some of the scenes are simply fascinating and esoteric, full of very interesting mysticism, I mean it seriously no joke. For me some of these scenes have a complex meaning and remind me of things I have read in the Jewish literature.",/review/rw2570295/?ref_=tt_urv

","Thanks to Chuck Norris and everyone involved for taking on the issues of the day head on! Mentioning God, respecting other religions and cultures, drugs and gangs, and keeping it on a family viewing level reminds us that TV can still get the point across without having to be dirty. Watching Walker Texas Ranger revives a spirit of decency in me that I used to feel when I was a kid. When most people were decent people. The police don't enforce laws that deal with moral issues anymore, especially using filthy language in public where it's obviously inappropriate, like in a nice restaurant on Mother's Day for example. I believe that decent people should still have the right to be decent people in public, and, others who want to reduce them to their own pathetic level should still have to pay the price for their incorrigibility. Anyone with their head on straight knows that filthy language is just another form of violence where someone can hurt someone without touching them physically.",/review/rw2570295/?ref_=tt_urv
