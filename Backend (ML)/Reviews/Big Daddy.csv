18 August 1999,Buddy-51,7," generally likable comedy
","It's hard not to like ""Big Daddy"", though diehard fans of Adam Sandler may well cringe at this further step in the sentimentalization of the comic actor.  For although this film has raised the hackles of a number of overly sensitive worrywarts for its seeming endorsement of permissive parenting, the film is, in reality, far more soft-hearted than hard-edged.  Actually, this seems to be, probably, the wisest direction for Sandler to go in at the moment because, as an actor, he conveys an aura of genuine likability that fits well with his Average Joe persona.  ""Big Daddy"" might have been a better film if it had not given in so easily to sentimentality and predictable emotional uplift, but Sandler's deadpan portrayal of an immature adult forced to grow up into responsibility-laden fatherhood makes the film relatively enjoyable.",/review/rw1449494/?ref_=tt_urv

17 July 2007,Aaron1375,7," A rather funny movie featuring Sandler.
","I am not a Sandler fan in the least, in fact for the most part I do not enjoy his movies. Still, this one was a rather funny little comedy even if it did have a rather unbelievable premise. Guy loses girl, guy tries to get girl back by taking in a kid who may or may not be a friend of his kid. So aside from that you have your funny scenes of Adam trying to raise a small boy to the best of his ability while also getting the attention of a new female in his life. Granted some of the jokes were just lame such as Sandler dressing up as the boy's favorite toy, but for the most part the jokes were hits. It did tend to get a bit sentimental towards the end, but not as bad as other movies of this type tend to get. Jon Stewart is in this one as is Sandler buddies Rob Snider. Steve Bushemi is also in it, but his appearance in the movie is rather stupid. So for a rather good comedy that isn't really great, but not unbearable like many Sandler comedies can get try this one on for size.",/review/rw1449494/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 1999,Brogan,7," Adam Sandler in top form!
","While all of the somphoric pre-teens will be giggling silly at the childish potty jokes shown in AUSTIN POWERS 2, the real adults will be laughing their heads off in a much funnier film called BIG DADDY.  This is Sandler's sixth starring role feature, and it seems that the sixth time is a splending charm.  This is Sandler's best work yet! Now in case you are wondering, I enjoyed both HAPPY GILMORE, and THE WEDDING SINGER.  But there's something charming and wonderful on why I enjoyed BIG DADDY more.  Perhaps it's seeing a over-grown kid taking care of a little boy.  Or it's Sandler mixing his in your face attitude that he gave in HAPPY GILMORE with his soft-spot attiude from THE WEDDING SINGER.  Whatever it is, it works, and it works very well! The simple plot of BIG DADDY is a 5 year old child is left on the doorstep of Sandler's apartment.  It turns out to be the child of his roommate (Jon Stewart), who's on his way to China for a legal case.  So what is Sandler to do, but to give him to the child protective service.  But it's a holiday, and they are closed, so Sandler keeps him for a day, then another day, and... well you get the picture. But the plot doesn't matter much with this film, it's the laughs, and you do get plenty of those.  But you also get a wonderful supporting cast. There's a good support from Jon Stewart, the always wonderful and beautiful Joey Lauren Adams, Leslie Mann, and Kristy Swanson (the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer). And what's a Sandler movie like if you don't have his usual character actor friends in small comic roles; Rob Schrieder, Steve Buscemi, Josh Mostel, Allen Covert (the caddy from HAPPY GILMORE who was also the limo driver friend in THE WEDDING SINGER), and Jonathan Loughran (the lazy-eyed football player in THE WATERBOY).  There's even a funny cameo role by director Dennis Dugan, as the man who refuses to answer the door on Halloween, while Sandler is taking his adopted son trick or treating. This film was a lot more funnier that THE WATERBOY, it was also funnier than THE WEDDING SINGER and HAPPY GILMORE.  It was believe it or not, more touching.  You can understand why Sandler doesn't want to let this boy go, since he reminds him so much of himself.  And Sandler sees that being a father figure isn't only fun, but it redeems himself from the lost of his girlfriend. I have to give both Sandler and director Dennis Dugan (the same director of HAPPY GILMORE) a round of applause.  They teamed up for a comedy that is not only successful, but will make A LOT of money. Sandler and Dugan are the best comedian/director team since the late John Belushi and John Landis.  I'm just hoping that they will continue to do films together in the futrue.  Until then, take your date, your friends, or heck just go alone and enjoy one of the funniest comedies (next to ANALYZE THIS, ELECTION, and RUSHMORE) of this year. This is a wonderful treat!  ****1/2 (out of five)",/review/rw1449494/?ref_=tt_urv

Sonny is a self-absorbed individual who generally thinks of no-one but himself much to the annoyance of his girlfriend. However, when a 5 year old boy named Julian (Cole Sprouse) ends up on his doorstep, Sonny claims to have adopted Julian in order to try and win back his girlfriend and prove himself worthy of her affections. Whilst Julian is in Sonny's care, Sonny does some growing up himself in the midst of some rather questionable antics as a caretaker parent.",/review/rw1449494/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2022,Mr-Fusion,5," Decent Sandler, awful writing
","On the whole, your typical Adam Sandler vehicle; this time his persona is put to use as an unlikely foster parent, completely out of his depth and still trying to slack his way through it. Naturally, he bonds with the kid, and I gotta be honest, that little guy really started to warm me over too. All of this begins to barrel towards something heartfelt and a satisfying finish seems certain . . .",/review/rw1449494/?ref_=tt_urv

Plausibility this movie doesn't have. But we are talking about Adam  Sandler, the man who has given us such brainteasers as Happy Gilmore,  and Billy Madison. Sandler's frat-boy humor - childish and,  scatological - has however, drawn a huge following as evidenced by The  Waterboy's huge box office, (a movie that I myself enjoyed and will  surely be pilloried for).  I expected one thing from this movie - a good laugh. And it delivered.  The obligatory tearjerker scenes were painful, but thankfully few and  far between. If you are in the mood for some humor-light on cheap  Tuesday, give this movie a chance.",/review/rw1449494/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 1999,Brad K.,8," Funny and surprisingly touching.
","Adam Sandler (The Waterboy, The Wedding Singer) has pulled off another hit with Big Daddy.  Sandler stars as a lazy law-school graduate who won't take the bar exam.  One day when his roommate goes on a business trip to China a child arrives at the day with a note claiming to be his roommate's son. Sandler takes the kid for a day and after having a good time decides to keep him to impress his girlfriend who doesn't think he's trying to grow up. His girlfriend dumps him and he's stuck with the kid.  Not surprisingly Sandler isn't a good father, but soon he bonds with the kid and he learns how to be a good father.  This might sound like a cheesy feel-good film, but with Sandler the humor is kind of low-brow, but often hilarious.  The film does also offer a few touching scenes between Sandler and the kid.  Sandler's performance was very funny, but reminded me a little of Jim Carrey's performance in Liar Liar.  Liar Liar if you have seen it was a regular Carrey comedy, but offered a couple of serious scenes which Carrey pulled off well.  Carrey then went on to do The Truman Show and win a Golden Globe. Sandler also has a couple of serious scenes which he nails well.  I'm not suggesting that Sandler is going to become a great actor (like Carrey seems headed for) but he may have the skill to do it if he wants.  Leslie Mann (George of the Jungle, The Cable Guy) and Joey Lauren Adams (Chasing Amy, A Cool Dry Place) are both good as sisters.  Jon Stewart (The Faculty, Playing by Heart) is solid as Sandler's roommate.  Twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse are convincing as the kid.  Finally, two favorites of mine have very funny supporting roles.  Steve Buscemi (Reservoir Dogs, Armageddon) is good as a homeless friend of Sandler's.  And Rob Schneider (Judge Dredd, Knock Off) is hilarious as an immigrant delivery man who is good friends with Sandler. Highly Recommended.",/review/rw1449494/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2002,soranno,," More Adam Sandler Foolishness
","Casting five year old twin boys as Adam Sandler's costars in this 1999 Columbia Pictures release was a very good idea. After all, Sandler's usual man-child character had to have somebody that he could relate to. Sandler portrays Sonny Koufax, a man who just might be the pure epitome of somebody who's not responsible. However, if that theory wasn't tested then there would be no film. In an effort to possibly win back his girlfriend (Kristy Swanson) who has left him because of his being irresponsible and has since taken up with another man, he offers to be a guardian for his traveling roommate's (Jon Stewart) son, Julian (portrayed by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse). Agreeing to assume full responsibility for a child makes Sonny think that Swanson just might change her mind about leaving him. It doesn't happen and now child services won't let him return Julian. Sonny learns to grin and bear the situation by attempting to bond with Julian and in so doing, he gradually begins to feel more like an actual responsible father figure. Of course things get complicated when Stewart eventually returns home and a custody battle begins (Julian has grown attached to Sonny by this time). Even this dramatic seeming scene evolves into more adolescent comedy. Sandler's fans should enjoy this film but since I was never especially a fan of Sandler, I consider it to be just another crumbled up piece of paper in the sorry recent film comedy wastebasket.",/review/rw1449494/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2007,g-bodyl,8," Sandler is funny!
","This was the first Adam Sandler movie I saw. I must say that I was impressed. Sandler plays Sonny who is just a cheap, low-life guy who works at a tollbooth and he has family issues. Then one day, a 5-year-old kid was dumped on his doorstep. He decides to take care of the kid even when there is legal trouble involving him and the kid. I thought that Dennis Dugan did a good job as directing. The chemistry between the actors was OK, but it works. There were fine performances by the Sprouse twins, Rob Schneider, and Jon Stewart. I also liked the music of this film. I enjoyed listening to the two versions of ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" by Sheryl Crow and Guns'N'Roses. Last of all, the film was pretty funny. This is a nice fit for your movie collection! I rate this movie a 8/10.",/review/rw1449494/?ref_=tt_urv

9 July 2015,anaconda-40658,1," Big Daddy Small Brain.
","Big Daddy (1999): Dir: Dennis Dugan / Cast: Adam Sandler, Leslie Mann, Kristy Swanson, Rob Schneider, Jon Stewart: Big scene involves Adam Sandler teaching a boy to urinate on a wall. That was the advertizing poster as if the studio felt that the toilet was inappropriate. Perhaps he should have taught the kid how to wipe his ass with the film's script. Title regards higher adolescence with Sandler put in charge of a kid. It is obvious that he will grow to love the boy and avoids having him placed in a foster home. Director Dennis Dugan still hasn't improved any. He still uses mindless vulgarity to get a cheap laugh. This sort of humour can be funny within certain context but here it just looks desperate. The big joke is suppose to be Sandler as a father figure but nothing he does is remotely interesting. Leslie Mann plays his brain dead girlfriend. Kristy Swanson plays his brain dead ex-girlfriend. Did I mention that Rob Schneider was in this sh*t too? Jon Stewart plays one of Sandler's friends who is forging ahead, but career wise, this is only forging ahead to embarrassment. One could argue that this film regards adult role models and bringing children up within a safe environment but the main agenda seems to be urine and fart jokes that become way outdated within the first twenty minutes. Perhaps they should urinate on this film and see if it will flush down the toilet. Score: 1 / 10",/review/rw1449494/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2006,lee_eisenberg,7," The Daily Show with Adam Sandler
","For the most part, ""Big Daddy"" is the average Adam Sandler movie, with him as slacker messing with the status quo. But this one certainly does have some intelligence to it. Portraying Sandler adopting a boy (twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse), the movie certainly gives adoption a good name, even if it uses complete silliness to do so. It's mostly interesting how the movie shows that he has to mature more in the process of raising this boy.",/review/rw1449494/?ref_=tt_urv

","Upon finishing Big Daddy I had a feeling of optimism and disappointment at the same time. This is one of the few perfect examples showing that Adam Sandler can effectively make a drama film, with some mild comedy, and create a relatively passable picture, but he opts out for cruder, more one-dimensional projects that provide little wit. This among 50 First Dates, Click, and Funny People can be viewed as the delightfully surprising Sandler pictures. The rest you can feel free to discard.",/review/rw1449494/?ref_=tt_urv

A kid shows up at his doorstep one day and he adopts him as a desperate ploy to win back his demanding girlfriend, that is until both of them unexpectedly develop a mutual bond. Undeniably silly, but very funny comedy is very likely to offend some with its immature, atypical parenting style, but it's well-cast and overflowing with Sandler-esque gags. Buscemi and Schneider have amusing supporting roles as a philosophical bum and a witless delivery man, and the film's climax is hilarious. **½",/review/rw1449494/?ref_=tt_urv

","Okay, I watched this movie and thought it had some good sequences, but then again, it was just corny. Like at the very end at the court hearing when everyone grabbed their cell phones and called their dads while sobbing - that's just utter crap. Apart from that I don't like Adam Sandler, which I concede is a personal bias. Nonetheless it HAD some witty sequences, although most of them did not seem genuine and are unlikely to occur in reality. I mean the basic approach was generally fairly good, but some scenes are simply too far-fetched. There are much more substantial movies out, so we definitely needn't praise this one too high. It would have been much better if the storyline had a stronger emphasis on the interpersonal burdens and struggles and less on the comedy aspect.

","If someone were to count lines spoken by each actor, I suspect that Adam Sandler's Sonny talks three times as much as the rest of the cast added together. That's not a good thing. He just never shuts his mouth; every scene has Sandler shooting off his yap in a bored monotone that's like listening to fingernails on a chalkboard. Sonny becomes the foster parent of a kid named Julian to impress an ex-girlfriend. Pathetic premise: exploiting a child for a self-serving ulterior motive is not funny. Sonny's efforts to bond with Julian consist of annoying the kid and you with his ever-moving mouth. Also, he takes the kid on humorless visits to Hooters. A new girl comes along, and the predictable schmaltz between Sonny, girlfriend, and kid begins. All the while Sandler continues to jabber on. Throw in some subplots of Sonny fighting with his room mate's fiancé, his parasitical living off of a lawsuit settlement, and you have this ""touching"" movie about a guy who gives you no reason to like him.",/review/rw1449494/?ref_=tt_urv
