23 November 2020,saadanathan,8," A true piece of cinema 8/10
","Woody Allen keeps showing why he is one of the best things to ever happen to cinema. Why we need him so much. without Allen, the cinema industry would have been a little boring. His films are unique and very powerful by meaning of beauty, art and emotion. ""A Rainy Day in New York"" is another perfect example of true art. The film stars with a young couple visiting New York for the weekend and end up in a rainy day full of excitements. The movie feels like another Allen love story from the start: the location of New York, the narrating, the differences between characters, how they fall in love against all chances, and the sweet ending that all viewers wish to have in their lives. When I first saw this film I immediately had a sense of nostalgia towards ""Manhattan"" and ""Annie Hall"". All films perfectly connect to each other, not by plot but more in a sense of genre and dialogue. The dialogues in this film are just like in any other of Allen's films, catchy, humorous and with a lot of sense towards life. The cast is amazing: Timothèe Chalamet is wonderful, his character resembles a lot of Allen's performance in his other films. Basically it's the same character but different actor. Selena Gomez is adorable and shines in her role, Elle Fanning is humorous, the entire cast works so well with the genre of the film. Overall I am in love with this film, I enjoyed it so much and I recommend it to everyone, I think this is my new favorite Allen movie.",/review/rw5247535/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 2020,inkblot11,10," Finally I saw the film I have waited for and, if its Woody's last, its a walkoff winner!
","Gatsby (what a great character name and played by Timothee Chalamet) is a student at Yardley College in upstate New York. Its a compromise between him and his parents, as Gatsby's main interests are card games and piano bars. Happily, Gatsby has a beautiful girlfriend, Ashleigh (Elle Fanning) who is a journalism student and writer for the college paper. Its Ashleigh's good fortune to snag an interview with a famous movie director, Pollard (Liev Schrieber) but must travel to Manhattan to meet this man. As this is Gatsby's home city, he is excited to come along and show her his favorite sights and the bar where they play the music he loves. So, off they go. After arrival, the two part, agreeing to meet for lunch after the Pollard meeting. But, things go off kilter. The director is in despair over the film he has just finished and, enchanted by Ashleigh's pretty face and winning ways, he insists she screen it with him. This will take hours and Gatsby gets the call she will be later than she expects. Annoying! Thus, Gatsby goes to visit his brother, who if about to be married. Horrors, this sibling tells Gatsby he can't go through with it, due to his fiancees screeching laugh. Having no advice, Gatsby then visits the set of an indie film being shot by an old friend where he runs into Chan (Selena Gomez) the younger sis of an old Gatsby girlfriend. She has agreed to be in the movie where she is to receive a passionate kiss in a convertible! All too soon, Gatsby gets persuaded to be in the movie and bestow this lip clencher. Ho ho ho. Although they trade barbs and insults, the kiss has rattled them both. As Ashleigh is still busy, Chan and Gatsby go visit a museum as rain is pouring. Wait, what's going on? Tihs enchanting film has all of Woody Allen's fabulous ingredients. The cast is great, with Chalamet shining brightly; all of the others, Fanning, Schieber, Jude Law, Rebecca Hall and the rest, do fine work, too. The sets are wonderful and the costumes snazzy. Most of all, the script is full of humor, pathos, and charm while the direction never falters. Yes, as stated many times, I am Allen's biggest fan living in Toledo, Ohio, which is nowhere at all. But, this film is superlative, matchless, everlasting and magical.",/review/rw5247535/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2019,ingmarbeldman-753-927212,8," No-brainer, carried by superbly funny dialogues
","The script has not a real story, but that fact is almost a statement to show that a film can and may be dialogue-driven.
When Tarantino was stupid enough to let every catchy dialogue slip out of his last film, Allen must have caught those lines and let his actors Rock and Roll with them.",/review/rw5247535/?ref_=tt_urv

","People will tell you this isn't Woody's best film but it's still more enjoyable, intelligent and amusing than almost all films being made each year.

30 June 2020,drpunkrock,9," My first Woody Allen film
","I can't believe but I have never watched a Woody Allen movie until this one and ""A Rainy Day in New York"" really makes me curious about his work. It is just so light, charming and funny with two great leads. At the same time the dialogue is witty and natural. Obviously we will not have a deep dive into today's problems, social commentary and the seriousness we have to have now in everything because this is not that kind of movie. It is a lighthearted comedy with an unbelievably charismatic Elle Fanning (who could have been written a little less naive) and an also convincing Timothée Chalamet. There is not head-heavyness, people don't ponder about the way their day goes so much. They just go on for the ride and see what happens next. It is a breath of fresh air. I also liked the way the lighting is used here. The music adds to the great experience. Thumbs up!",/review/rw5247535/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2020,samratsingraur,8," A piece of art.
","Yet another masterpiece by Woody Allen.
No matter how many movies he makes, never fails to give a perfect blend of nostalgia, euphoria and diff aspects of love.
I loved how this movie has the finest ingredients one can offer.
It features an incredible piano background score which seemingly connects with the rainy view of Manhattan. Chalamet did an obvious Oscar worthy performance and the supporting cast (Jude Law, Selena Gomez) didn't felt like excluded. Another treat is def the film's wonderful setting of New York City and the way art, culture and romance is depicted is fascinating. It's a shame that these type of movies are wiping away with time.",/review/rw5247535/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2019,Julie_in_ams,8," A rainy day in NY - or Everything I wish happened to me in one single day!
","Nothing too surprising. This is Woody Allen in Manhattan.
""A rainy day in New York"" came to me as a rather naive and refreshing way of doing what W Allen does. Gastby and Ashleigh question what they are and what they are becoming. They do that - to my perception - through the eyes of someone of their age. They think but do not overthink. Action immediately follows. They do not get lost in doubts and do not have to deal with an ego bigger than them. They act, they feel, they learn and repeat. They have so much to learn from that one day. I found all three young characters likeable and empowered, and the actors on top of their game (Timothee Chalamet, Elle Fanning and Selena Gomez). I would have loved to spend that day by their side The rain never bothered me anyways.",/review/rw5247535/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2020,maurice_yacowar,8," High Society misfit finds truth and truer love.
","As usual, the new Woody Allen film - his 48th feature in 51 years! - is a disturbing departure from the last few. What disturbs is its newness. We're disappointed when our expectations are denied. So an adjustment is necessary if we are to take it on its own, proper terms.
The plot is familiar: when a small town hick comes to New York, her relationship with a city guy is challenged by the Big City. It's Neil Simon country but Allen infuses it with an uncommon density of personal inflection. That goes beyond ""What's sexy about short-term memory loss?"" And ""Time flies....Unfortunately, it flies coach.... It's not always a comfortable trip.""
Specifically the film responds to the time and circumstance of its making. When Mia Farrow's questionable allegations of Allen's alleged abuse of her daughter resurfaced, Amazon broke their agreement to fund and distribute the film. So here: ""The world is full of tragic little deal-breakers."" And ""There are no newspapers that are not tabloids."" Not since Manhattan has Allen delivered such an encomium to New York City: ""You are here or you are nowhere. You cannot achieve another level of anxiety, hostility or paranoia anywhere else."" Instead of the usual star-studded Allen cast, here Jude Law is the film's one big star.
As his name suggests, Gatsby Welles is a cultural construct. ""Gatsby"" signifies the illusion of old wealth and social stature. ""Welles"" connotes a maverick individuality. The hero's wealthy family propel him into the arts, the responsibilities of high society, the mixed blessings of the privileged. But at that privilege he bristles.
This Gatsby took classical piano but yearns to play romantic ballads in a bar. He doesn't have to be able to sing well to enjoy singing a classic ballad. Instead of college studies he prefers high stakes gambling (at which he succeeds uncommonly, like Woody the filmmaker). Ultimately Gatsby breaks out of his romantic rut, unlike brother Hunter, doomed to marry a woman with an emasculating laugh.
Gatsby's girlfriend Ashleigh comes from a wealthy Tucson banking family. A journalism student at Yardley College, she takes him to New York to interview the famously serious film director Roland Pollard. ""You're too original to have mass appeal,"" the awed Ashleigh assures him. Gatsby's old schoolmate dismisses his work with ""Never a decent toilet joke."" When Ashleigh quotes Pollard's line ""Love and death are two sides of the same coin"" she doesn't understand it, but has evoked an early (funny) Allen title.
The R.P. director's nominal echo of Roman Polanski sets up Ashleigh's NYC adventure. While in real life Farrow persists in her discounted allegations against Allen, she publicly defends Polanski against the sex charges to which he pled guilty. Here Pollard, his writer Ted Davidoff and actor Francisco Vega personify the predatory film industry that feeds off the star-struck, helpless naifs. Pollard uses his artistic suffering, Davidoff his unfaithful wife and Vega his star power to seduce the relatively innocent Ashleigh. Only the early return of Vega's girlfriend preserves Ashleigh's relative chastity. Implicitly Allen places Farrow's persistent allegations in the larger context that undermines her.
Seeing Ashleigh on TV with Vega, the heartbroken Gatsby hires a hooker to represent his fiancee at his mother's classy dinner As Gatsby describes his mother's literary circle: ""It's rich housewives who have the leisure to pursue esoteric culture. The out of work, discussing the out of print."" After his mother sees through the ploy and sends the woman home she tells Gatsby that she had herself been a hooker. Indeed that's how she met his father. Indeed she used her savings to set up his eventually successful business. This candour opens Gatsby's relationship with his mother: ""She's a lot more than I gave her credit for."" With that knowledge he can accept himself as well as her and he can follow his desire to stay in New York and live the life he prefers. There is not such a gaping gap between the respectable and the pragmatic after all. There is non shame in honesty.
The film ripples with allusions. Its sentimental core starts with the opening song: ""I got lucky in the rain."" The singer sadly needs a song, then ""You came along,"" the love of his life. Relationships begin and end in the rain here, climactically over ""Misty,"" because the rain signifies the melancholy chill from which we seek love for shelter. ""What I really need,"" Gatsby avers, ""is a Berlin ballad."" In the converse call to social realism, Gatsby is supposed to see the Weegee exhibition at MOMA, but he abandons that to follow his new interest, Chan, the grown-up kid sister of his old flame Amy, into the older histories in the Met.
This relationship begins with the Benedick-Beatrice sparring on a student film set, where they meet and have to act a passionate kiss. Eventually their life will follow that art. They meet on that film set, have that museum date then meet again under the Central Park clock reliving a favourite romantic film. Chan's home is full of Old Master paintings and antiques. She reads Gatsby as an exotic searching for a romantic dream from a vanished age. That becomes her.
Chan wins out over Ashleigh because she knows Allen's familiar dependency upon art for a meaning and consolation otherwise rarely available: ""Real life is fine for people who can't do any better."" That's a film-romance re-write of Gatsby's mother's career.
Unfortunately, to cleanse themselves of the old Allen ""scandal"" Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Hall announced they were donating their salaries to charity. They make themselves victims of the slander and misrepresentation Allen has suffered and survived for so many years. This is a film they should be proud of having served.",/review/rw5247535/?ref_=tt_urv

","I cannot write a proper review yet because thanks to a shameful lynching campaign against Woody I was robbed last year of my yearly Woody Allen film (me and millions of fans around the world).

25 November 2019,catebaum,6," A bit silly but who cares
","It's true that Woody Allen is writing silly dialogue that's completely old-fashioned and way above the heads of any youngster in New York, and it's true that the story here is completely silly and motivations are way off. But it's somehow a charming way to spend a couple of hours. Elle Fanning is kooky and does her best to be a chip off the old Diane Keaton block. Timothee Chalamet is dreamy and solid but doesn't get enough clout. I'm not fond of the huddle of middle-aged film lotharios jumping all over Fanning, and I don't think Selena Gomez had enough sharp lines. However, it's another study from Allen of New York as a live character taking over the people in it and sweeping them along. Cherry Jones is extremely well-cast as the mother with a secret and Allen saves the best till last.
I probably won't watch it again for a long time, not one of his best but not the worst either. It's a shame that Netflix have done what they did to Allen. Not just for him, but the hundreds of names that rolled past in the credits of all the cast and crew who worked so hard on this movie to have it junked in the US, who did nothing to deserve this. Thank god I live in Europe where art is respected, and we have the intelligence to separate the work from the artist. I look forward to the next one to come out.",/review/rw5247535/?ref_=tt_urv

31 August 2019,helgis-63120,6," Not a masterpiece, but not worthy of any censorship either
","The movie has quite a strange period feeling and maybe this artistic tool was intentional. Everybody uses smartphones already, but for conversations only. No Twitter, no other social media... Some jokes were actually a bit tasteless, very atypical for Woody Allen. A couple of chuckles throughout the movie, typical Woody Allen. Ellen Fanning had the best lines and she was the best overall. Liev Schreiber was very good also with the material he was given. Cinematography is beautiful and perfect for a rom-com - warm, bright, sparkling and full of colours. Chalamet was just wooden and dull. That was the first performance by him I've seen and I don't want to judge him too early or too harsh but he seems to be extremely overrated. Maybe the right lead for a late Woody Allen film.",/review/rw5247535/?ref_=tt_urv
