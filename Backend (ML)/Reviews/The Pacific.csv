18 November 2013,blanche-2,10," Beautiful, hilarious, poignant film
","Alexander Payne is one director who marches to the beat of his own drummer - films in Nebraska, uses black and white, and casts some parts locally to get the correct flavor. He doesn't miss a note.",/review/rw3599254/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2013,StevePulaski,10," Keep on the sunny side of the desolate landscape
","Director Alexander Payne is currently one of the best dramatists in cinema right now simply because he makes films about realistic people in realistic situations. Payne seems to see no value in fantasy elements, far-fetched circumstances, or overly-comedic nonsense. His accomplished filmography includes the uproariously funny and poignant Sideways, The Descendants, which I went on to name my favorite film of 2012, the bold satire Election, the humble and depressing About Schmidt, and the daring abortion comedy-drama Citizen Ruth.",/review/rw3599254/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Nebraska"" offers viewers an unstinting view of some very unpleasant things: extreme decrepitude, boundless stupidity, greed and ignorance. There is also very deep, and very painful, love on display in this portrait of an embittered working class eking out a meaningless existence in a dysfunctional and remote place.

15 November 2013,nesfilmreviews,8," A heartfelt slice of Americana
","Director Alexander Payne ""Sideways"" (2004) and ""About Schmidt"" (2002) deftly handles the road-movie plot structure once again with dark humor and satirical depictions of contemporary American society, yielding fantastic results yet again, as a heartfelt journey to examine his frail and flawed characters. Payne himself is a Nebraska native who felt strongly that the movie be filmed black and white to capture the mood of the old American heartland, and in order for the film to receive funding from Paramount, he had to settle for a smaller budget. As a result, Payne films and casts the movie in local communities with actual residents which provides a realistic texture to the family bonding tale. ""Nebraska"" is a humorous and heart-rendering story of family, but it also sheds a light onto the people of America's heartland, and our countries economic, moral, and cultural decline.",/review/rw3599254/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Nebraska"" was nominated for a ton of Oscars, though it received none. This isn't surprising, since the film is exceptionally well made but is also NOT the sort of film the average viewer would enjoy or even pick in the first place.

7 April 2014,claudio_carvalho,7," Father and Son Journey
","In Billings, Montana, the old mechanic Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) has dementia and believes that he has won a million-dollar prize, but it is actually the marketing advertisement of a magazine. Woody does not drive anymore and he tries to walk to Lincoln, Nebraska, to collect the prize. His wife Kate (June Squibb) and his older son Ross (Bob Odenkirk) want to send him to a nursing home, but his estranged younger son David (Will Forte) decides to satisfy his fantasy and travels with him to Lincoln to claim his prize. During their journey, they stop in Hawthorne to visit their dysfunctional family and friends and David learns the past and dreams of his father.

","Bruce Dern gives the performance of his life. He is wonderful. He maintains the quality of tuning in and out of reality throughout the film. Typical of someone with dementia, you are never really sure if he's there or not. There is a moment in the film when he drives and you can just see him glow and come alive.",/review/rw3599254/?ref_=tt_urv

","NEW YORK FILM FESTIVAL: There is a magical and profound power that is exuded from Alexander Payne's film ""Nebraska."" I loved just about every second of it. Written by Bob Nelson, the black-and-white dramedy takes us through the beautiful and rural Midwest showcasing opulent and lavish cinematography by Phedon Papamichael. And let's not forget the trio of stunning performances from Oscar-nominee Bruce Dern, Will Forte, and June Squibb. The film tells the story of an aging and ailing Woody (Dern) and his son David (Forte) as they venture off from Montana to Nebraska to collect a million dollar prize that Woody believes he has won.",/review/rw3599254/?ref_=tt_urv

6 November 2013,steven-leibson,10," Hilarious movie where SNL comedian Will Forte plays the straight man
","""Nebraska"" stars Bruce Dern playing Woody Grant, a 77-year-old man living in Billings, Montana who believes he's won a million dollars from a publisher's sweepstakes just because he received a craftily worded sales letter from the company. When the movie opens, we see Dern on foot, hoofing his way on the outskirts of Billings and on his way to Lincoln, Nebraska to claim his prize. It quickly becomes clear that the years have not been kind to Dern's character Woody. Alcohol, age, the bleak northern US Midwest, and the long line of life's events have left Woody a bit addled, which is why a sales letter can make him believe he's a millionaire. Turns out, he was always like that.",/review/rw3599254/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2013,george.schmidt,10," Sterling Dern and low-key Forte make for a memorable road trip
","NEBRASKA (2013) **** Bruce Dern, Will Forte, June Squibb, Bob Odenkirk, Stacey Keach, Mary Louise Wilson, Rance Howard. Filmmaker Alexander Payne continues his streak of making films about people struggling with terms of self-worth and supposedly impossible dreams with his latest about a Montana codger (Dern, low-key perfection) whose dogged determined trek to the titular state to claim his wins in a seemingly bogus million dollar jackpot that his beleaguered son (Forte, equally winning) agrees to help him make the odyssey. Along the way of pitfalls including a nasty wife (Squibb, whose constipated pug-like countenance is the perfect foil), duplicitous family and so-called-friends (an oily Keach) only empowers the frail old coot in his desire to gain what is his. While this is not Payne's best work it is ambitious with its bleak yet beautiful black and white cinematography by gifted Phedon Papamichael and a stream-lined script by Bob Nelson.",/review/rw3599254/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2013,generationfilm,9," Nebraska- The Latest Whimsical Tale from Alexander Payne is a Subtle and Poetic Reflection on the Loss of Time and the Affirmation of Hope
","Time is a peculiar yet universally felt concept whose effects can be seen in its numerous consequences either through the obvious traits of aging or the far more subtle and subjectively felt intangibles such as regret. In the heart of the Midwest there are depressingly poetic examples of this thoroughly felt concept of time how the vast stretches of what appears to be infinite plains of nothing are filled with monuments of ruin either in the ghost town cities or the deserted farmland all of which are consequences of economic hardship and familial anchors. This is the melancholic setting of Alexander Payne's new film Nebraska, a sad yet endearing road trip film that becomes a sort of modern Don Quixote influenced story where a regret filled, dementia gaining father resembling the infamous dreamer Quixote resiliently chases the remnants of a thin dream accompanied by his affably neutered son serving as the loyal Sancho Panza. Nebraska clearly resembles previous films that have captured the distinct American spirit and eccentric characters of the parched Midwest, including Peter Bogdonovich's The Last Picture Show and David Lynch's oddly accessible The Straight Story, but remains uniquely an Alexander Payne film containing his penchant for mixing whimsically dry humor with poignant humanity. At the center of Payne's film is an astonishingly subtle performance from experienced acting veteran Bruce Dern whose stern blankness and aging dementia makes for an intriguing parallel to the derelict environments throughout the Midwest setting which is captured brilliantly through cinematographer Phedon Papamichael's poetic black & white imagery. This whimsical yet mournful ode to Midwestern life, values, and legacy is aided through the lost art of subtle acting and the usually non-existent talent for subtle direction allowing the intended humor to land directly and the emotional heart to enter gracefully. While Nebraska might be an engaging, humorous, and sweet amalgamation of Payne's previous works where the road trip element of Sideways meets the intimate family dynamic of The Descendants it's definitely a transition film for the quirky storyteller as it embraces a far more poetic and humanist side to the director's incredibly heartfelt style of filmmaking. It's difficult to say where exactly Nebraska will fall in Payne's established film canon but as it stands on its own it's a deeply lyrical reflection on the loss of time and a credible affirmation on the long enduring existence of hope.",/review/rw3599254/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2013,Sergeant_Tibbs,8," On the road again.
","It's been nine long years since Alexander Payne's top twenty worthy masterpiece Sideways and I can't shake off the feeling he has another one in him. He's an odd director with his contradictions, safe yet often unsafe, mature yet often silly, exciting yet mellow. I hoped The Descendants would be that film but my expectations were set far too high. While it's grown on me a little since I saw in the theater as I've accepted it's more of an observant drama than a sharp comedy, it's a relatively weak followup to Sideways. Unfortunately I've found that his older films are not good at all, Election disappointed me a lot and I thought About Schmidt was utterly pointless and charmless. I guess that's the main issue with his films, they feel too on- the-surface while it's surface is too low-key to be enough. Sideways manages to connect, but the others feel like their stories are in a bubble, isolated from us.",/review/rw3599254/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2013,buzzbruin-650-409183,10," A great film
","My favorite comedy is sideways (among others) and I love Mr Paynes films (like Election. As an advanced senior I was totally with Bruce Dern, the crankiness, the lack of balance, the drinking the boredom. the many naps. WIll Forte is absolutely superb as a kind loving son, in every way. His patience his help on the many scrapes his dad gets into and his true love. He is a cinch for an Oscar nomination. So are Dern and the actor who plays his wife. Although the film is outright funny, the sensitivity which Payne shows in handling the actors and the bleakness of Nebraska. The people of the small towns are portrayed is as close to real people as you can get. The black and white added to the story, especially the portrayal of the cities and small farms. I think this film will be loved by seniors. Younger people, after they have see Hunger Games could learn a lot from the lives of their grand-parents. A magnificent film, go see it!!",/review/rw3599254/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2014,TOMASBBloodhound,8," The big shrug that is rural Nebraska.
","Alexander Payne's films have really mellowed over the years. Consider the tone of the near-mad cap farcical ""Election"" to ""The Descendants"", and now this one. The next stop would seem to be still photography. Nebraska is the story of an impromptu family reunion of sorts as an elderly man attempts to travel from Montana to my old stomping ground of Lincoln, NE. The old man, played to perfection by Bruce Dern, believes he is holding a winning lottery ticket worth a million dollars, when in fact it is just a misleading promotion for magazine subscriptions. Despite repeated assurances from his wife and son, that there is no pot of gold at the end of this rainbow, the old codger keeps his slow motion journey moving. After injuring his head in a fall, the man and his family stop for about an hour of screen time in his old home town in a rural area of the state. Here, some old wounds re-open as he has to deal with old family turmoil and fend off both relatives and former acquaintances who feel the old timer owes them a piece of his new-found pie. The film is definitely not going to please everyone, but viewers with patience who can appreciate a nice character study will probably enjoy it to some degree.",/review/rw3599254/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2014,shawneofthedead,9," Alexander Payne's finest film for grown-ups yet - bittersweet, uplifting and heartbreaking all at once.
","In a film industry dominated by crowd-pleasing blockbusters and gross-out comedies, Alexander Payne's gentle, thoughtful movies have always set themselves apart. More chatty than explosive, less hilarious than contemplative, Payne's films - from About Schmidt through to Sideways and The Descendants - have been the welcome antidote to Hollywood's worst excesses. Nebraska, an uplifting, heartbreaking treatise on love and family, is perhaps his finest yet: a sweet, tart, perfectly-measured balance between the comedy and tragedy of life and old age.",/review/rw3599254/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2014,jackasstrange,9," An emotionally investing sage after a meaning for life
","I admit: I cried while watching this film. Is so moving and honest. You know, if you have old relatives you will understand why this film is so powerful and touching. It's about hope and having a meaning to live. Imagine yourself there, in the place of the protagonist. Old, alone and feeling emptiness on your life. You'll use all the means possible to get out of the stagnation, like in fact,everybody would do, and that happens frequently with people of that age. You see, a fake 1 million award to buy a truck is everything that moves the old protagonist. It looks unrealistic? Absolutely yes. But there is where the beauty of Nebraska lies. Is a metaphor, a metaphor that is present everyday, with persons of all ages. Searching a meaning for life. And I say: there isn't more intelligent, touching or beautiful existentialist works than Nebraska. What we have here, ladies and gentlemen, is a masterpiece. An unique masterpiece. Is not a dry drama either. There is a lot of comedic moments on it, which can turn the experience even more refreshing. I rather consider it a dramedy than a drama, personally. The cinematography is beautiful, the black and white choice was excellent given the tone of the film. ",/review/rw3599254/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2014,ferdinand1932,8," American Gothic
","For those of us not from the Midwest, there is something strange about the place. Its people are taciturn but full of character; its landscape is wide, foreboding and sends the viewer into silence. ""Nebraska"" sits somewhere between ""The Last Picture Show""; monochrome and a sad town full of back stories; and ""Fargo"", black humor, caricatures and illusions.",/review/rw3599254/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2014,saschakrieger,6," Life in black and white
","Sometimes, one learns about a film's key characteristic in its first frame: a dreary highway somewhere in the American wilderness, somewhere in the outskirts of a rather non-descript town. An old man walks on it, fragile, yet doggedly ploughing on. Yes, Nebraska, the new film by Alexander Payne (Sideways, The Descendants) is a road movie. And yes, as is often the case with Payne, it is a family story. a father and son who never had much to say to each other, the younger (Will Forte) an average man with an average job and a girlfriend who just walked out on him, the elder a life-long drinker, hard, bitter, unapproachable. Of course, they will find some closeness on their journey which is a strange journey indeed: the father has received a letter proclaiming he won a million dollars, Everyone else recognizes it for what it is: a trick to sell magazine description but the father, somewhere between stubbornness and beginning dementia, refuses to accept it. Try as they may but again and again, Woody walks out to go the 750 miles to Nebraska to pick up his prize. In the end, son David relents and drives him. They stop by in his father's home town where an impromptu family reunion is staged, the assumed riches generate various desires and old conflicts alight again among the town's people before they continue on their journey, which unexpectedly ends in a little, humorous triumph.",/review/rw3599254/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2016,oOoBarracuda,10," ""He just believes stuff that people tell him.""
","The real travesty of living in middle America is the frequency with which wonderful films that I greatly look forward to never make it to this section of the planet. The 2013 film by Alexander Payne, Nebraska was one such film. Nebraska was the film I anticipated seeing most in 2013, never made it to any theaters near me. Somehow, I hadn't seen it in the three years since it was released either, so I was greatly looking forward to seeing this. I purchased Nebraska before seeing it because I was that confident that I would love it, and I was right. Starring Bruce Dern, Will Forte, and June Squibb, Nebraska explores the divide between parents and their children, aging, and the expectations one has for themselves vs. the reality that happens to them as a father and son make a journey together to retrieve what the father believes to be a sweepstakes prize. A deeply moving examination of the life issues we all must face, Nebraska is an absolute treasure of a film.",/review/rw3599254/?ref_=tt_urv
