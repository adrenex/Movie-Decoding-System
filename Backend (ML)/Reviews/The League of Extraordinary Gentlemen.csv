10 August 2020,Avidviewer-02847,8," Father-Son drama, comedy and romance and a nice mix of all three
","This is the first major film of English actor James D'Arcy who wrote and directed it, a very nice first film. Liam Neason and his real son Michael Richardson play a father and son whose troubled relationship goes back to the death of the wife and mother of the main characters. It's set in beautiful Tuscany in Italy.",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2020,harry_tk_yung,," Good father-and-son movie from a real-life father-and-son team
","Two things about this little-publicised movie caught my attention. First, after Liam Neeson's gallant appearance as Ra's Al Ghul, as well as a proliferation of other action characters, a change is welcome. Second, the charm of Italy also beckons, and in this I am recalling montages from Diane Lane's ""Under the Tuscan sun"" (2003).",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2020,pattyrusciano,7," Good movie
","I enjoyed this movie, I find nothing negative about it and don't understand the low and caustic reviews some gave. While it is not spectacular, it is better than most of the dark and supernatural stuff flooding the market. A little predictable, a little humor and a heart made for a pleasant watch.",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2020,paindweller,8," This is 7 with a bonus point due to the unfair reviews
","This was so beautiful, slow, unremarkable, simple, plain, absolutely lovely for anyone who enjoys what's real for those descriptions couldn't describe real life more. Well worth the watch.",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2020,Gordon-11,," Emotionally engaging
","I think this film is a great portrayal of a fractured father and son relationship, that heals when they finally confront their pains. I find it emotionally engaging.",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2021,TxMike,," Father and son mend relationship in Tuscany.
","First off this movie has the novelty of Miche√°l Richardson, the lead character as Jack, is the real life son of Liam Neeson who plays his father, Robert. The story involves the accidental death of his mother when he was much younger, in real life the actor's mother, Natasha Richardson, died from an accident when he was quite young.",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2020,reisen55,9," Pleasant evening with dysfunctional friends in Tuscany
","I found a film called INDIAN SUMMER some time ago, delightful small film about a summer camp and age and growing up. FEDORA is another triumph. This little gem reminds me of those films that ARE small discoveries. In an age of Star Wars and Spielberg and more ..... here is a quiet little story, no great budget with very good acting, drama taken to a non threatening point and the best music score heard. So many who don't like it probably think Palpatine was the god of acting. Well, sit back with a glass of wine, some bread and let this film take your artistic thoughts. It's easy to do. And it is a lot cheaper than flying to Italy.",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2020,tomsawyer-01858,7," Why so rude ?
","This movie is not about Italy.
It's about the emotional disaster in a husband and a kid,
who lose their wife and their mother.",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2020,eyeintrees,10," Italy... thank you.

30 September 2020,Kirpianuscus,," I love it !
","I love it for so many motives than it is difficult to define the main cause. For Liam Neeson and his story who must be said . And it is said, in this film, in fair manner. For the silhouette of Natasha Richardson . For young Micheal decent job. And, sure, I admitt, for Italy, more precise for the flavor of so many films having this land as perfect location. A touching film and, grace of acting, no doubts, more than a film. A confession, testimony, portrait, reconciliation. Not the name matters . But the state. And the state, against every irony or critic, is just special. So, yes, it is a film who I love it !",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2020,jamactechnical,6," Who doesn't love Liam Neeson?
","I have only seen Neeson in action films so I was curious to see how he would fare in a comedy drama. It was nice to see him stretch a little bit in this film and having his son along his side was interesting to watch. Generally, I am not a fan of comedies, but I did enjoyed some of the very few lines and goofs that made me chuckled loudly. It's the onscreen relationship between father and son that I enjoyed the most. A decent 6 stars.",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv

29 August 2020,faye-marshall,10," A beautiful film
","It's disappointing that so many don't appreciate this beautiful film. So cleverly written, it takes you on a journey to the Italian hills into the lives of a father and son who reconnect after the death of the sons mother. The movie is engaging, brilliantly filmed and a breathe of fresh air encouraging you to stop and smell the roses. A must see.",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2020,caroldenembo,8," For those of you who gave this a low rating...
","...You have no heart. This is a sweet story of father and son, and I'm sure as they filmed there were moments Liam Neeson and his son acted from real emotion after losing their wife/mother. Was it predictable, a little, but who cares. I enjoyed it very much and the scenery was bellissimo!!",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2020,hakra1,5," unfortunately too intended
","There were so many mixed reviews so I watch it for Liam Neason, and he did a very good and credible job, acting as the father. and the story is nice too, but unfortunately the atmosphere is never developing, the dialogues are too intended, so very muched forced, the storyline too obvious and michael richardson - sorry to say - not ready for this role. he is knocking down his lines and his acting never convinces. so there could have been much more, but at the end its a lost opportunity",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2020,babycakes-45269,10," Pleasant movie about family and loss
","Michael is a gorgeous mix of both his parents, and a very talented actor. This was a very pleasant film about family, loss, new relationships, love, heartache...with amazing acting. I tend to get distracted while watching a movie but this one I watched all the way through. The scenery was so amazing, thank you for a beautiful film.",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2020,movieman6-413-929510,4," Missed opportunity for James D'Arcy to use the father and son duo in a real drama.
","Made in Italy is a comedy drama film directed, written and produced in part by James D'Arcy. This is the first film he has directed, written and produced. For this movie he has played more minor roles in other movies.",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2020,ferguson-6,6," house and family reno
","Greetings again from the darkness. The Tuscan region of Italy is one of the most beautiful places on earth. It's a terrific choice for the setting of one's first screenplay and directorial debut. It's also a marvelous spot for real life father and son actors to work together. All of that is in play here as noted actor James D'Arcy delivers his first feature as writer-director, and the father-son team of Liam Neeson and Micheal Richardson star as, yes, father and son. This is a story of estrangement and re-connecting amidst the glorious wonder of Tuscany.",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2021,Ckn48,5," Gentle Comedy
","A Gentle movie with some pleasing scenes.
Rural life in small towns like Italy really do provide an idyllic backdrop.
Being warm enough to enjoy an outdoor cinema.
alfresco dining.
Lindsay was enjoyable as the Agent trying to sell the property as were the comedy of errors around all the faults found. The little girl was also adorable.
The nightmare buyers were hilarious",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2020,GuiltyCrown93,10," Simple Sweet Emotional Comedy? With twists!
","To start out, it feels like your typical sweet rom com. Seems like you can see the plot coming, etc. But then you realize it also wants to make you cry at parts. All in all, excellent movie with a lot of unique aspects. Everything you could want from a ro
Liam Neeson was amazing.",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2021,eternallyafar,7," Aesthetically Pleasing...
","As someone who loves Italy, Italian culture, speaks the language and always watches movies like this, I kind of expected more from it. It was indeed aesthetically pleasing, but the action was missing. I felt like the actors could've done it a bit better and the story could've had more added to it. But the shots of beautiful Tuscany and the house were more than enough for me. The relationship between father and son was not as much developed as I thought it would be, but it did make me cry in the end, with a nice conclusion. All in all, heartwarming and pleasant comedy/drama that you will enjoy, especially if you're dreaming of visiting or living in Tuscany!",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2020,felix-rauch-valenti,6," Quite predictable
","Occasionally funny movie about a damaged father-son relationship. It's very predictable though, even for me who is not normally good at predicting endings.",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2020,danielle-88205,10," Lovely feel good movie
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Yes, it is a little predictable, but I really enjoyed watching Liam Neeson in this role and I love Italy and British actors. There are som beautiful scenes and it is a touch emotional here and there in a good way. If you're looking to watch something uncomplicated and unpretentious, with a feel good ending, this is the one to watch. It's a good date movie ;)",/review/rw6009892/?ref_=tt_urv
