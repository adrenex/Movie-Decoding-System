28 August 2021,Sleepin_Dragon,6," All endings are sad....
","...apart from the eventual moment where credits rolled, it's a decent watch, it just felt too long at times, and a bit repetitive.",/review/rw7329220/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2021,aastikhimta,7," Don't see reviews and watch it first
",The plot was good and different. The whole movie was fine and there were some fine twists too. I ignored all reviews and watched it . It was a good movie. There weren't so much action scenes but apart from that it is good. Ending could've been better.,/review/rw7329220/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2021,kosmasp,7," Science Fiction Fairy tale
","Any movie that might bring anyone to read on certain things ... is good in my book. And while I assume that some watching this, may not have heard of Orpheus story ... they hopefully will look it up.",/review/rw7329220/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," Flawed, but a refreshingly unique story.
","Making her first feature film debut as writer, producer and director, Lisa Joy had a great concept, but the execution needed a little more work. Her directing was excellent, and the conceptual story genius, but her screenplay needed fine tuning. There were many plot and technical issues - most lazy, but bringing her futuristic sci-fi vision to the big screen, was effortless. The story felt very long and slowly paced. Had such amazing leads and their performances - Jackman, Ferguson and Newton not been cast, I don't think I would've rated this higher than a 5/10. They carried the film right to the end, of which up until the last 20 mins was dragging. Along the way, it was a 5 or 6/10 in my mind, but that last 20 mins with some surprising twists and revelations - and that perfect ending, added more stars. It's a 7.5 rounded up to an 8/10 from me. The critics went too hard on this one. If your enjoy mystery, crime, sci-fi, and romance, give this one a chance... there's nothing really like it. Props to Joy for this little gem.",/review/rw7329220/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2021,GenXer,8," Much better than given credit for

20 August 2021,solojere,8," ""There is No such thing as a happy ending..
","... especially if it is a happy story."" Reminiscence takes place in a somewhat post-apocalyptic world. After countless wars and natural disasters, the world is divided between the rich and the poor. The film follows Nick Bannister, who navigates people's memories for money. Nick's life is changed by new client Mae. A simple case becomes an obsession after she disappears, and he fights to learn the truth about her to navigating his and others' memories. While the film dragged at times, I thought it was pretty entertaining for a slow bur thriller. It also felt like a mix of inception and Minority report. However, the idea of memories being the key to solving a mystery was fresh enough to help the film stand on its own two feet. In addition to this, I thought the cast was fantastic. Hugh, the Wolverine, Jackman's performance was amazing, and this is just another example of how great of an actor he really is. I won't spoil anything, but I enjoyed it and would recommend giving it a watch.",/review/rw7329220/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2021,jtindahouse,4," Bland and not as smart as it thinks it is
","The first rule in film is Show, Don't Tell. A reasonably simple rule and one that the majority of films adhere too. Apparently 'Reminiscence' didn't get the memo though. The exposition in this film is bordering on ridiculous. First of all we have narration, and not just set up narration, but constant narration over-top of the majority of scenes. Then there are the cringe-inducing moments where the characters just talk us through everything that is going on. At one point a revelation is being revealed to the audience and Hugh Jackman's character is just summarising it point by point for us. It was embarrassing.",/review/rw7329220/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2021,s-ireland,8," Nearly didn't watch this after reading reviews
","Don't be put off by reviewers who won't invest brainpower to work out what's happening and why. This is a good film, well cast and well acted, great plot and whilst not action packed it rolls along nicely. I was entertained and I enjoyed it.",/review/rw7329220/?ref_=tt_urv

21 August 2021,fraser-simons,8," Solid noir with cli-fi trappings
","After being initially disappointed that it wasn't more cerebral, as the trailer makes it seem like it could go either way, I ended up pleasantly surprised. This is solid noir; sometimes subversive of the genre, other times hitting tropes well.",/review/rw7329220/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2022,deloudelouvain,7," Decent futuristic thriller.
","I didn't think Reminiscence was a bad movie, certainly not like some other reviewers tried to portray it. The story was sometimes a bit difficult to follow, simplicity sometimes just works better, but at one point it all made sense, you just have to be patient. The acting could have been better, certainly with that cast, but again it wasn't all that bad either. My wife and I did enjoy this sci-fi thriller so no complaining here. Could it have been better? For sure, but that's the case with almost everything so just take a chill pill and try to enjoy a movie with its flaws.",/review/rw7329220/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2021,boblipton,5," Stuffing A Decent Mystery Into Film Noir Technique Just Because
","A decade or so in the future, in a half-drowned Miami, Hugh Jackman and Thandie Newton run a business dredging up old memories from people. While they work for the court system for futuristic depositions, most of their customers are people seeking happiness and comfort in the past. One shift, as they are about to close, Rebecca Ferguson bounces in, wanting to know where she left her keys. Jackman is captivated and they soon begin an affair. But then she disappears, and Jackman pursues her trail, leading into a welter of corruption.",/review/rw7329220/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2021,Xstal,4," Familiarity Breeds Contempt...
","Memories, remembrances, reflections and retrospection, recalled without originality, innovation, imagination and ingenuity, leading to repetition, duplication, restatement & replication - but most importantly of all it's dull, boring, tedious and dreary.",/review/rw7329220/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2021,Gordon-11,," Flat and dull
","The premise may be interesting, but the story telling makes the film flat and dull. There's little chemistry between characters. I don't care about what happens to them, or rebar happens to the story.",/review/rw7329220/?ref_=tt_urv

20 August 2021,martinrobertson300482,7," Pretty good
","""Reminiscence"" feels like an old film noir mystery movie with a modern twist. What could of been a more serious take on ideas seen in ""total recall,"" instead takes things in a different direction with its decent plot.",/review/rw7329220/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2021,redkyng,4," Nope.... I didn't like it!
","It started with a good idea (Inception inspiration) past the first half hour everything will change, slowly i lost interest, it's boring, weak plot and some weird moments that I just wanted the movie to end... sorry this is not Inception, not even close!",/review/rw7329220/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2021,andrew-hill515,7," Pretty enjoyable, if you lower your expectations
","It's not much of a story, not much of a mystery, not much of a revenge story, not particularly deep, not particularly insightful and doesn't have half as much to say as it thinks it does.",/review/rw7329220/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2021,rangerxus,5," Reminiscing the days when studios released good movies
","A total failed attempt at film noir. All the elements were there: a masuline gruffy leading man narrating the movie (Jackman), a loyal sidekick (Newton), and the femme fatale (Ferguson). But the film was never able to gain enough traction to take flight. The storyline had potential but substandard acting and meandering plot-line left me detached and indifferent. There were a couple of plot twists but not unpredictable.",/review/rw7329220/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2021,Features_Creatures,2," Yeeeesh...
","What if Christopher Nolan had a traumatic brain injury? When Brian Cox in Adaptation said ""god help you if you use voice-over"" he was talking about this movie. Probably one of the worst screenplays I've ever seen. The CGI looks like a video game, absolutely TERRIBLE dialogue. ""Memories are like beads on the necklace of time"" or ""Come on dad, let's get you home to your medicine"" or ""nobody wants to see a girl in a thrift store dress"" when she's obviously wearing a like $3000 designer cocktail dress. The writer director has only ever been a producer for bad tv shows and it shows. The entire look and feel is right out of an NBC prime time sci-fi show that people's dad's begrudgingly watch as they fall asleep. And the entire concept feels like an artifact of 1999-2003. This is embarrassingly bad in every possible way. Razzie for screenplay.",/review/rw7329220/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2021,terrylarosa,9," Great film noir of old with a futuristic setting
","Eerie to see my hometown ( Miami ) like that but still cool. Nothing terribly new but still a good mystery that keeps you entertained until the end. Good acting throughout, especially Hugh. Rebecca is beautiful as always. Great to see them together again from The Great Showman. There's nothing convoluted or complicated about the movie if you have an actual thought process. Is she bad, good. Is there true love? This takes the meaning it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all to a whole new level. A couple of good action scenes keep things moving but it's Hugh's eternal yearning to find the truth that wins the movie. Never was I bored despite the slow pace. Reminiscent ( pun intended ) of Inception and Minority Report. The new crop of movie viewers are so pathetically demanding but they end
liking utter trash like the movie Joker. Final tidbit: that's not the way the story of Orpheus ends but I can understand Hugh's spin on it. Enjoy if you can think for yourselves.",/review/rw7329220/?ref_=tt_urv

10 September 2021,danielfnemes,8," ""Without that sadness you can't taste the sweet""
","SF, crime movie, film noir but mostly an unusual and beautiful love story. A slow paced drama in an eerie atmosphere with solid performances from Hugh Jackman, Rebecca Ferguson and Thandiwe Newton. The surreal flooded landscape, the Philip Marlowe style narration and the beautiful music come together nicely. Those with bad reviews probably only have the patience to watch a Justin Bieber clip. If you are an intelligent and sensible person give it a try, you will be surprised.",/review/rw7329220/?ref_=tt_urv
