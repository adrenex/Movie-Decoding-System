","I haven't seen the original Star Trek but it has a reputation for being heavy on the technobabble and continuity lockout. This film is an attempt to remake it closer to a traditional Hollywood blockbuster and it works. It is easy to follow and full of exciting action, though I can't compare it with the original.",/review/rw2064251/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2019,Macleanie,9," Perfect introduction to Star Trek
","Shamefully this 2009 movie was pretty much my first full experience of what the Star Trek franchise has to offer. I have never been a fan and was completely new to the series. I have since begun to understand its following although I'm glad to have started with JJ Abrams remake as it was the perfect introduction. As a science fiction action movie it ticked all the boxes and had a well crafted cast which made watching this movie thoroughly enjoyable. The story is along the lines of what I expected going into it but together with its effects and smart script it was smooth and sleek. I really enjoyed learning how these characters came together and involved more action than I participated, much to my delight.",/review/rw2064251/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2009,ametaphysicalshark,," Thrilling adventure with great characters, maintains the spirit of the original series while appealing to a mass audience. A landmark blockbuster for sure
","I'm a fan of ""Star Trek"", but not obsessive, having read only one ""Star Trek"" novel, owning no merchandise and only TOS in its entirety on DVD. I abhor ""Voyager"" but like every other Trek series, including ""Enterprise"" although nearly all of that show's especially good episodes are in the fourth season. My favorite remains TOS for its unforgettable characters, performances and stories, as well as the sense of camaraderie aboard the Enterprise.",/review/rw2064251/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2013,johnnyboyz,6," Story and substance come second to a brave, brash and thoroughly accomplished rebooting of some old favourites.
","The 2009 rebooting, re-envisaging of the Star Trek franchise drops us head first into its franchise's latest adventure - adventures often consisting of large groups of shrewd crew members commandeering grandiose, deep-space travelling vessels and getting into strife for our viewing pleasure. As if a dogfight between two spaceships wasn't enough to open a science fiction/action blockbuster, American director J.J. Abrams throws in a significant death, on top of an equally significant birth; a time travelling space ship ganging up on a ship half its size and a highly dramatic escape sequence. You can practically see the grin on the man's face as he unleashes this opening sequence onto fans of the franchise, who are likely stoked to the point of frenzy in the first place.",/review/rw2064251/?ref_=tt_urv

","I should start this by saying that I always leaned more toward Star Wars than Star Trek. I've memorized much of the Star Wars epic sci-fi fantasy and numerous characters, but the universe of Star Trek is one I have not really explored. The beauty of this film is that you can be a hard core Trek-fan or a simple lover of sci-fi or action and still find this an incredibly enjoyable movie. I myself was surprised when I first saw it, seeing all the relatable humor it was pouring out, but unlike the redundant idiocy of let's say Michael Bay, the jokes are welcome and don't go too far.",/review/rw2064251/?ref_=tt_urv

","For all those who are under 18 and this is their first exposure to the Star Trek saga, I urge you to see the greatest Star Trek movie of them all: Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. ""Khan"" is the standard on which all Star Trek movies and episodes must be measured against. The writers of the new 'Star Trek' movie claim that their inspiration was the 'Wrath of Khan' and would like to think that their new 'update' is equal to the earlier masterpiece. Unfortunately I must report that the new 'Star Trek' is nowhere close to Star Trek II. Quite the contrary, it is a pathetic mess of a screenplay and until you see 'The Wrath of Khan', you cannot understand what I'm talking about.",/review/rw2064251/?ref_=tt_urv

","If this weren't a Star Trek movie, to it would be ok. As Trek, it's pretty bad. Abrams has a huge problem of ignoring science one of the legs of Star Trek, and leaving gaping plotholes. He totally ruined Spock with that ridiculous romance with Uhura. Spock, an instructor, carrying on with a student? Allowing himself to be brow beaten into changing her orders?

8 May 2009,soundtechpro,8," A Huge Let Down for Trekkies - If only...........
","First let me say that I have been a lifelong Star Trek fan.That being said I was very disappointed with this movie. I had high expectations with JJ Abrams on board. I fully expected this movie to be true to the Star Trek universe instead of the Action/Sci-Fi movie concept. Star Trek has always been first and foremost a show about relationships and moral/social issues. Action is great but only when it is secondary to the characters we love so much and the story line. I know that I was expecting the movie to not only show how the main character met but how those relationships developed. Basically what we got was a quick introduction to the characters and an action movie with a confusing story line that left many unresolved issues that was not in line with the original series events. While Star Trek has always made use of the time travel concept it appeared it was only used in this movie as a way to work Leonard Nimoy into the movie. The ""Nero"" story was so weak and the movie was not really at all about the development of the characters we have all loved for so many years. As for the ""Nero"" story, just killing Nero would not have reversed the time line. We know in the original series that Amanda Grayson (Spock's mom) is alive and that the planet Vulcan was never destroyed completely with only a few Vulcans left to colonize another planet. In the original series, the reference was that Vulcans were a waring people who almost destroyed themselves before they gained control of their emotions. I am still trying to figure this confusing story line out. I suppose that some will say the movie was a success because it was action packed, exciting and appealed to a non-trekkie younger audience. However, I personally feel it was a failure. I admit that the casting was good. However, good casting cannot overcome a bad storyline. My advice, If you are a true Trekkie, wait for the DVD. If you just like action/sci-fi then you will love it. But there was nothing special about this movie. It left me very hollow and thinking about ""what might have been"" had they made a movie with the characters being central instead of the action/fight scenes. I believe this movie was written and marketed to be new, hip and appeal to teenagers. It is definitely not faithful to the Star Trek genre.",/review/rw2064251/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2009,yarborough,1," An Insult to Our Intelligence
","Just as the 3 ""Star Wars"" prequels ruined the Star Wars franchise (though I never liked it to begin with), this new ""Star Trek"" prequel is a damaging blow to the Star Trek movie franchise, and this prequel crap needs to stop now. The pathetic writers of this new Hollywood generation can't come up with any new, creative ideas, so they just keep going back in time (as they did with ""Batman Begins"") with established franchises, as if we need to see over and over again how the characters we love so much got their start. And the BIG problem with this new ""Star Trek"" movie is that they TOTALLY foul up the history of these characters and then insult our intelligence by having Spock (Prime - the older Spock) say that his actions altered the course of history (which, we learn, is why Kirk's father dies on the day of his birth this time around). What a lame, poor excuse for why the history of Mr. Spock, Captain Pike, Captain Kirk, Dr. McCoy and even Chekov is so radically different from what it is in the Original Series and its Original movies. What is different? For one, in TOS, Kirk first served under Captain Robert April on a different starship, and had years of experience as a first officer before becoming captain. In this movie, Kirk's serves with Captain Pike of the Enterprise first, right alongside Spock, and on his FIRST day of service he becomes first officer and then on the very same day is suddenly promoted to Captain! Quite a leap up the ladder! In TOS, Spock is supposed to have served under Captain Pike 13 years before he and Kirk meet. Also, Dr. McCoy suddenly becomes Chief Medical Officer on the very same day that Kirk suddenly becomes Captain. Wow, what a coincidence! This movie so ridiculously rushes the whole thing, but it's OK because Spock altered everything, right? In this movie, Chekov is on the bridge as navigator even BEFORE Kirk ever steps foot on the Enterprise. That means he has MORE experience than Kirk! So in TOS how did Kirk become Captain while Chekov was a lowly ensign? Oh yeah, Spock altered history. And Chekov is said to be 17 in this movie. When did he start at Starfleet Academy--when he was 13?! Finally, this movie has no intelligent (or even intelligible) story. It has a ludicrous story of the Romulans (who look like a biker gang in this movie) creating Black Holes out of planets. And this movie is all action and loudness with dizzying camera shaking, which totally goes against TOS's cleverness of playing on ideas rather than action. Abrams has no business in the ""Star Trek"" franchise, and I hope he never makes another ""Star Trek"" movie. But I guess as long as they make plenty of $$$$, it doesn't matter. That's more important than being faithful to the characters and history of the show, right?",/review/rw2064251/?ref_=tt_urv

","Admittingly, I have to say I did not want to see Star Trek, even though the trailer looked interesting, I thought this film was only going to be for the fans of the TV series and no one else would get it. I did watch the show with my father when I was a child, but it never caught on with me to keep watching it. But after hearing some really great reviews, I decided to go ahead and check the movie out and honestly I'm glad I did. I really enjoyed this movie and the reason why? It was like a prequel, not just meant for the fans, but how these famous characters came to be. This is everything a summer blockbuster is meant to be, fun characters, great adventure, fun effects and a good interesting story. Not only that, but this movie was so much fun to watch and it may make me even get back into the show.",/review/rw2064251/?ref_=tt_urv

20 May 2009,Poseidon-3,," Frenetic, brainless bastardization of the original concept.
","It happens on daytime television: A new storyline is developed which renders everything that came before it impossible and inconsistent. It happens in comic books: Entire histories and established conceits of a character or situation are redone without regard for the previous effort. Here it happens in a movie. A revisionist, souped-up, tweaked version of the famous television series comes along that jettisons about 80% of what made the original meaningful, resonant and special. Not only does it reconfigure or ignore the ""established"" continuity of the characters' prior universe, but it's also unapologetic about it. Who cares what anyone else thought when they watched ""Star Trek"" during its original run or in syndication? This is the way it's going to be for the A.D.D., Xbox, Jonas Brothers, youtube, Hannah Montana, iPod, CGI set and anyone who doesn't like it can be damned. Since the makers of this and other products, which undercut any personal investment a viewer may have made in the previous work, have no regard for that audience, the only recourse that audience has is to resist supporting the new work. However, that hardly matters when something comes along that, despite its emptiness, idiocy and even ignorance, appeals so much to the target audience that it can't help but be a huge success. All that's left to do is either chuck one's emotional connection to the original concept and get on board or sit at home with the 4 decade old series on DVD. Though not every fan of the original series will be this polarized, it's a decision that many folks will have to make. The good news is that Pine is an appealing, dynamic and enthusiastic Kirk (though not much like William Shatner, for better or for worse), Quinto is close to perfection as Spock in both looks and manner and the chemistry between the core cast members is adequate enough to provide a decent sense of camaraderie in the inevitable follow-up, especially if, on the off chance, the producers decide to actually follow the intended path and put the team into the scenario of seeking out ""new life and new civilizations"" together instead of rehashing and retreading everything that was already ""established."" Cross and Ryder also prove to be effective choices as Quinto's parents. Also, Bana's ship is decidedly imposing and threatening looking. The bad news is that virtually any semblance of the vision, social commentary, optimism, discovery, sense of unity or even a sense of adventure, really, is absent from this incarnation. In its place are lightning fast camera-work and editing, animated effects, over-the-top ""stunts"" and lots of explosions and death. The people are props and/or caricatures and are, in fact, incidental to the action ""showpieces."" With luck, the next installment will capitalize on the premise of the Enterprise's mission and allow the ensemble to gel into a unit that sticks together as they explore the farthest reaches of the galaxy. This messy, inane, disrespectful prologue doesn't inspire much faith, however. Oh, and check out the female Vulcan council-member's beaming expression of pride and joy when Spock is admitted to their academy! Did anyone associated with this film ever see even one episode of the series?",/review/rw2064251/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's mind-boggling to think that fans of the teleshow(s) would actually wax enthusiastic about this one: STAR TREK ZERO (the all-too appropriate working title) lacks every single essential ingredient to make a movie memorable. The performances are all of high school talent show-calibre and only make all the more glaring the faults of the disjointed storyline(s). (Bana must be singled out, here: I honestly don't recall the last time I saw so uncharismatic a villain in a major motion picture. Unless, of course, we count the two FANTASTIC FOUR films.) The camera swoops and spins and dives and goes in one ear and out the other, up the nostril and through the nasal passage to grandmother's house we go- all in the vain hope that viewers won't notice that there's nothing really going on (like in a video game). Not since ALIENS (the second one, by the guy that did GIGANTIC) have I laughed so hard at so many ""dramatic moments."" Watch this one on the internet and save yourself a couple of bucks.

","Wonderful special effects, brilliant camera work, excellent special effects, believable actors to take the place of Shatner, Spock, McCoy, Chekov, Sulu, Scott, and Uhura. Must see and enjoy but leave your brains at home. The story doesn't make sense. Let's just assume that I am a Romulan and knew the boo boo Dr. Spock is going to make. The solution is simple, get the red matter and kill the super nova 129 years before it happens. The retribution doesn't make sense. It won't stop the Romulan genocide. The logic is simple. I am a Romulan, ghastly found error Dr. Spock made and if I killed the planet Vulcan, and Spock (or Ambassador Spock) have not died, he's going to go about making the same boo boo 129 years from now killing the entire civilization of the Romulans. A reasonable alternative is just to kill Mr. Spock, without the need to kill the entire planet of Vulcan. So what happens if entire planet of Vulcan died and I guess the Romulans wouldn't be saved either without an advanced warning. Knowing the entire mess of the story and we wish to mend the stupid things Romulans made by killing off Kirk's father and the planet Vulcan an easy solution is for Spock to show how NCC 1701 can travel to time going back the time where his father was killed, just before so we get a Doppleganger, a twin NCC 1701, but the second ship, knowing Romulans will disable the code to protect the shields to kill the Romulan's waiting to kill the original star fleet. Thus once the Romulans are destroyed, the red matter confiscated from the ship is then used to destroy super Nova that suppose to explode 129 years later and the NCC 1701 thereby goes into the same period, without any event. The End. An uneasy Star Trek saga, a bad premise, an illogical story is not likely is going to sit well with IMDb top 250 movies for long. Since when will these writers get their head straight? 10 for movie, 1 for story line, 1 for premise and 1 for logic. My guess 3/10. Still a must see movie for Trekkies like me despite of a terrible movie's story and a nightmare for me. It's as unsettling as Captain Kirk's death when the bridge fell over him after leaving Nexus. This will be up there with bad story lines as same as other previous star trek. In any event, the Wrath of Khan is underrated and this, overrated, except for the special effects and the notion of time travel, but lacks the obvious logic. A much simpler story Ha Ha Ha is for Mr. Spock to go to planet Romulan and murder baby Nero, then kill off the exploding supernova.

","There are several generations of Star-Trek fans out there and based on their refusal to 'Grow Up' will in all likelihood be more. Those of us who enjoy the original series and perhaps a couple of the movies, realize that despite all the effort to replicate the original dream, directors will never please everyone. This newest film entitled "" Star Trek "" is reasonably better than others in that the new cast is well selected. In this offering we have Bruce Greenwood as Captain Christopher Pike, the original Captain of the Enterprise. (Superior selection.) Chris Pine plays the young James T. Kirk, who is full of vim, vigor and enthusiasm. Zachary Quinto plays the early Spock, full of expectation, promise and definitely logical for the role. Karl Urban plays the erasable Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy. It seems they select the right man as he fits reluctantly into his role. Simon Pegg plays engineer, Montgomery Scott well and believable and I believe, James Doohan would have agreed. John Cho is the youthful Lt. Hikaru Sulu, the pilot and portrays him very and observably masculine. One wonders why? The navigator is the very young Russian Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin) Based on his performance, very believable. Then we have eye-candy Zoe Saldana as Communication's officer Nyota Uhura. Her 'brief tease' and wondrous appearance in this film is not only attractive, vivacious, but forcefully sexy. What is unexpected is her apparent love interest which will conjure up a bagful of mixed images in the sequel. After the introduction of Eric Bana as the heavy, Ben Cross as Sarek, we are further treated to special guest appearance by Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime. The film is loaded with magnificent action scenes, hurtling explosive crafts, photon blasts and violently exploding worlds. In addition, the inter-dimensional space-time travel and encounters with gigantic Black Holes will have the audience gasping and wanting more. Excellent film and a worthy addition to Gene Roddenberry's dream. ****",/review/rw2064251/?ref_=tt_urv
