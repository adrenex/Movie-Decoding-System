14 May 2022,briancham1994,7," This was Wandavision 2, not Doctor Strange 2
","I liked this movie and I think it's a fine addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has the distinct directorial style of Sam Raimi with some quirky camera choices, horror elements and quick montages. The fight scenes and magic are more creative than in previous films, such as the musical battle. The visual design of the universes are very distinct and feels like other worlds have really come to life. It was very exciting to explore other worlds and other versions of Dr. Strange. Scarlet Witch has a truly terrifying presence.",/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2022,andrew-hill515,5," Well, it was shiny and colourful
","So, carrying on from WandaVision, Wanda continues her arc as a slaver who faces no consequences for enslaving a town full of people to now being a mass-murdering slaver who risks the lives of trillions of people's lives, destroys universes, enslaves more people, so she can murder a child, which will help her switch her plan to murder a mother and kidnap her imaginary children.",/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2022,cricketbat,6," Not enough multiverse and maybe too much madness
","Sam Raimi definitely put a splash of horror in this action film. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is darker & more violent than any previous MCU movie, which could be considered a strength. However, I felt like there was not enough multiverse and maybe too much madness. Despite the entertaining visuals, the plot is fairly chaotic, and the acting & dialogue are inconsistent. This movie is an entertaining ride, but it's a little too messy to stand on its own.",/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2022,nakrugt,2," Scarlet Witch: The Movie, ft: Sorcerer Supremes
","Great visuals, actors and actresses do their best to make it believable. Benedict Wong's character proves to be a bad-ass. Olsen also does her best. Cumberbatch is as usual. No bad things there. Even the cameos can, at some level, sell the plot points.",/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2022,PedroPires90,4," Terrible plot and script, boring and pointless
","I always had some issues with MCU films but now they aren't even entertaining? Oh Raimi, what a disappointment. I honestly only liked the horror elements and being able to see some blood in a MCU film. Nothing else.",/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2022,pranayjalvi,5," Convuluted story, just like the multiverse
","Doctor Strange became a very popular character, especially after the Endgame events and had a good share of performance in couple of MCU movies thereafter. Multiverse of madness was on a different hype level, however it turned out to be a disappointment affair on some levels.",/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2022,Vimukthi7,6," somewhere in the multiverse, there's a better version of this movie that exists.
","The overall pacing is relentless and the sequel shows its hand a lot earlier than you'd expect. There's been endless speculation from fans about the villain, which i won't spoil here, but it's revealed surprisingly quickly.",/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2022,boblipton,6," Seems Rushed For A Two-Hour Movie
","Xochitl Gomez shows up from an alternate reality and asks for Benedict Cumberbatch's help. She can travel between the various realities, but she has no control over it; when she's in a life-threatening situation, she autonomically zips into a a different world. She's been doing that a lot, since monsters have been attacking her to steal her ability. This is at least the second Dr. Strange she's asked for help -- here's the corpse of another.",/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2022,mikeferguson,3," Greedy Disney's going to wreck our favorite movie franchises!
","They obviously believe in the ""quantity vs. Quality"" business theory, and seem quite content to continue pumping out these mediocre entries in the Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar brands, until their formerly dedicated audiences finally cry ""enough!"", and just...walk away, shaking their collective heads at how sad it was, the day The Mouse bought the rights to these storied franchises. My only remaining hope is that they'll pump the breaks and not try to oversaturate us with the two best remaining storylines - those being the wonderfully heart-filled Ant Man and Spider-Man series, which are the only ones (so far) they haven't managed to ruin.

30 July 2022,lockout-59506,3," Didnt make much sense
",Plot holes all over the place. Lots of things didnt make sense. Wanda made her kids with magic but couldnt do it again. She could astro project to another universw where the kids were and could send demons thru the multiverse but couldnt travel herself. She killed the one she loved but felt nothing when she did but somehow we are supposed to believe she loves the kids she doesnt have?,/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2022,schlomo-jones,4," Time to retire the MCU
","After months of hype, we are left with a mess of a story that is mostly just CGI blobs, some light shows and some boring dialogue. I loved the first Strange movie, it's my second favorite after Captain America Winter Soldier. So this was extra disappointing.",/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2022,srdjan_veljkovic,2," Very uninteresting
","It's actually boring most of the time. When there's something actually going on, it's mostly not interesting. I mean, for stuff to be interesting, there has to be some semblance of sense, but none of this makes any sense, not compared to the real world, itself, or other stuff in this MCM (Marvel Cinematic Multiverse). I mean, we have Wanda destroying the Multiverse and very, very few people show up to defend it. And that's just the most obvious thing, there's like a gazillion things that are utter nonsense.",/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2022,cjbarrett,3," Pretentious nonsensical hokum
","Richard Burton wasted his talents on alcohol. Let's hope Benedict Cumberbatch doesn't waste his talent on Marvel. What does it take, time wise, for him to make one of these derivative, adolescent wastes of cinematic energy? How many real films might he make, how many plays might he contribute to, were he not involved in this childish pablum?",/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2022,jacquelinesandra-34671,4," Disappointing
","I can't believe I am writing a bad Marvel review but I can't lie, this movie was really disappointing. A couple of surprises but I was expecting way more after watching No way home....
Didn't mind the horror side of the story, actually made me laugh. As for the music , I am a huge fan of Danny Elfman but even the music was bad.",/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2022,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,5," Multiverse of... Something-ness
","Doctor Strange 2 is the MCU's latest balls-to-the-wall crossover event, and it's noticeably not as well done as everything else was in Spider-Man: No Way Home. The effects and action are nice, but the story squanders a palpable script in favour of frustratingly fragmented (which multiverses can suffer from when stories don't address all the inherent issues of multiple worlds directly interacting with each other) fan-service and even more sequel-fodder with its abrupt cliff-hanger ending (pre-post-creds mind you, but still).",/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2022,naomimuldrew27,4," Cannot explain my disappointment
","I could have actually cried watching this. Dr. Strange is one of my favourite Marvel movies but this was just plain awful. 1 hour in and I was debating leaving. Marvel are losing their touch, and ever since Endgame, it just hasn't felt the same, apart from NWH. Sam Raimi messed up big time.",/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2022,drjgardner,2," Dr Stupid in the Mashed Potatoes
",Really!@#$ Can you make a more stupid film? Were the writers stoned and when they wrote the script? It's just one silly scene after another. Did I mention the terrible acting? Did they get paid for this? If it weren't for the great special effects this film would be completely worthless.,/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2022,Arcadia1701,5," Hugely disappointing mess
","This movies suffers the same fate as Spiderman no way home - ie good plot idea broadly and massively underwhelming execution. In particular the story boarding, script, music and direction is very poor.",/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv

9 July 2022,elliotjeory,4," When marvel goes too far...
","Is it me or is this the most baffling marvel film there is? Is there a plot or a story? It just seemed to be nonsense. A film should make sense whether you are a big fan or a novice. I like Marvel but I'm a casual viewer. I don't want to watch a film where it's like, ""you need to watch film 23 and episode 9 of season 1 to understand the plot. Loved the first film too. This is literally madness.",/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2022,M-Winchester,5," Dr strange 2 More like WandaVision 2

6 May 2022,collectorofsorts,5," What A Mess! I Want My 2 Hours Back!
","This definitely wasn't what I expected. It started out good and I was thinking: All Right, Here we go. But that didn't last very long. Then it got so chaotic and scattered. It went everywhere and nowhere. Because you couldn't follow it in a meaningful way. I won't give any spoilers. I'll just say that I was highly disappointed. And once I got past the half-hour mark, I actually considered walking out. This film deserved a better script and a more appropriate director. Raimi wasn't the best choice for a Doctor Strange film. Other stuff he's directed, I love. But this was a Hot Mess!",/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2022,marcell-karafa,6," Unfortunate decline in story
","Man, what a disappointment, expected way more interesting plot as Strange is one of the coolest and most powerful characters - at least so far it seemed, as Wanda just mopped the floor with him and kinda everybody. She is waaaay more overpowered than supposed to and her motive as a main villain? Being with her children in another universe... Rather unoriginal, kinda we got that in Wandavision. The sensation hunting with other universe's characters were not used well or interestingly whatsoever, while that america chavez girl is just a terrible actor with zero chemistry with the stars. Just a weak story, badly used characters, way too much nonsensical ""fight"", was a missed opp, really hoped marvel can still be on that level than before Endgame, however seems Spiderman was the last big hit that was spot on. Thor is the last hope, the rest is seemingly ruined or much lower quality than the predecessors.",/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2022,chrisgray-31350,1," Terrible
","This was by far the worst marvel so far. The plot was all over the place bringing in all these characters that had no purpose. I wish they would just stop trying to create avengers within avengers, just ruins it.",/review/rw8124333/?ref_=tt_urv
