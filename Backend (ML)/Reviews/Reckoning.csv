29 April 2019,MoistMovies,7," Not as good as infinity war..
","But its a pretty good film. A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...",/review/rw4826082/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2021,davyjones-636363,10," Crazy in every sense
","This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up. It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created. I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own.",/review/rw4826082/?ref_=tt_urv

25 April 2019,ahmetkozan,10," The End of an Era!
","After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.",/review/rw4826082/?ref_=tt_urv

29 July 2019,msteaua93,6," A very expected ending
",I gave this movie five stars for effects but for story not so great and i expected at this happy ending i didn't expect that bit of drama but anyway dissapointed especially the way Thanos end in the movie so lame exactly like NK in GOT so lame when you expect at something more but no this is a proof if you rush something you ruin it the note is 8.7 just because effects and is marvel nothing more.,/review/rw4826082/?ref_=tt_urv

22 August 2019,randomStuff101,6," slighty awkward or boring at times, slow dialog, some cool stuff
","Unfortunately clumsy. I enjoyed all previous Avengers, and a few scenes in this are very cool and funny, but this one lowers the bar overall. For me the story petered out instead of maintained momentum from previous movies. The dialogue struggles to be interesting, boring sequences at time.",/review/rw4826082/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2019,jtindahouse,4," Time travel is such a lazy way to write stories
",Only a month or so back I was talking to a friend about how much I hate it when serious movies use time travel to get their characters out of problems. I have no problem with movies like 'Back to the Future' or 'Hot Tub Time Machine' that are both comedy based and use the time machine as a plot for the movie as opposed to a solution for characters problems. When a serious movie uses it though it as lazy as writing as dream sequence in my opinion.,/review/rw4826082/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2019,TheBigSick,," Neither self-contained nor original
","The film has too many references to previous Marvel films, and is not friendly to those who are not Marvel fans. General audiences may easily get confused: what is this and why is that? The story is not original either. We have seen too many time-travel films, such as Back to the Future and Days of Future Past. This film does not offer anything new. Besides, the last thirty minutes are kind of redundant, and the overall running time is unnecessarily long.",/review/rw4826082/?ref_=tt_urv

12 May 2019,ravi2445,9," Very disappointing
","Right in the beginning, you know how the movie is going to end...the good guys are going to win. How anti-climactic that was.. The stage is not set right (half of all humanity is gone, but the enormity of that is not explored...)...when you have Thanos give his explanation as to why he did what he did, I found myself thinking - well, he actually has a point.
In the meanwhile, every single superhero is given time to fight, say some cute things, some say a few smart things, a few even manage to say profoundly philosophical statements...
The quantum physics explanations used to explain how things are done, are plainly non sense... ..they just made stuff up as they went on.
Alls well that ends well. Except we spent 3 hours to find that out.",/review/rw4826082/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2020,Leofwine_draca,9," Great climax!
","So here we have it, AVENGERS: ENDGAME, the expansive sequel to not only AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR but also to the whole last 13 years or so of Marvel cinema. It's a film that had big boots to fill but the good news is that it's a complete success and every bit as enjoyable as its predecessor. At three hours I wasn't sure about the pacing, but even during the slower first half the viewer's interest remains piqued thanks to the witty dialogue and huge cast of well-established characters doing their thing.",/review/rw4826082/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2019,vert2712,9," The zenith of the MCU franchise.
","I feel like I'm wasting my time writing down my thoughts about Avengers: Endgame, because nothing I (or any critic) could say about it would ever dissuade a prospective viewer from seeing it. But after having had the chance to watch it at a preview screening, I can't help but say a few spoiler-free words.",/review/rw4826082/?ref_=tt_urv

26 May 2020,auuwws,10," Great
","Perhaps Infinity War was the film of Thanos in which he imposed what he was seeking, but Endgame is the movie of Avengers who impose what they seek, and perhaps his title, which translates to ""the end of the game"" means the end of what Thanos sought. But do you think that would be that easy? Contrary to what Thanos did quite easily? you are wrong! The Infinite War movie may have been very touching and shocking when Thanos killed half of the universe creatures, but the endgame is more impactful and shocking than him. Although the cuff will be in the interest of the Avengers in this movie, nothing comes for free, must be given to get, and perhaps the long time period for the movie that reached three hours was very reasonable because their journey to achieve their goal was neither easy nor many options in front of them.",/review/rw4826082/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2019,nickgray-12862,7," Emotional but bit messy.
","So it all ends. I have loved most of the MCU, some have been too predictable but I awaited after IW to see how it would all pan out. Firstly some of my favourite characters are a joke. Please don't dumb Thor or Banner/Hulk down, not necessary. Great starting scene, then slow dramatic next 1.5 hours. It builds to the time travel reversing all section with too many plot holes. We've all seen other time reversing movies who have done it so much better. The last hour is spectacular, great to see all the gang back but it feels rushed. Emotion runs high and defo not a kids film in my eyes. Cap is great Stark is amazing but everyone else feels like there just there. What I loved was the beauty of the final scenes, wonderful score and saying goodbye to old friends. Overall wanted more, but even far from perfect is still pretty good.",/review/rw4826082/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2019,Paynebyname,4," The writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product.
