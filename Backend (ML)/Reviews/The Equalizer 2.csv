6 January 2014,kriddirk,9," A good entertaining adventure movie made in the classical way
","I am lucky I didn't read the book. In fact, the book and film of any story is always very different from each other and should be rated separately without comparing them. It is a 2:30 hours movie and it isn't boring at any moment. From the beginning till the end you are entertained by the story and the action. It is a big production, one of those you have to see in the theater due to the imagine, the landscapes, the special effects. And talking about the special effect; there are enough, but for once this movie is not an ""ONLY and overloaded action"" movie. Lately, most of the films are possible to see on the screen at home, because the imagine is not of that type a cine-screen is needed. This production is made like the classical big productions, like Lawrence of Arabia or The English Patient. So, enough action, not boring, entertaining and you can leave the theater in a relax status and not tired of all the car chases.",/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2014,azadeh-tafreshiha,10," Beautiful movie, historically inaccurate
","All things considered I recommend this movie, It's picturesque and captivating. The music is very beautiful as well. And hands down to Ben Kinsly as always! It is a beautiful movie. The actors are brilliant and the story is very captivating. For once I didn't feel wretched when foreign cinema has tried to show Persia. At least Persians were speaking Persian even though they looked like Arabs. The illustrations that were used as the school material were the exact replicas of what remains from Ibn Sina and what you can see in his great book. That said the movie is very wrong in historical facts. What was supposed to be Isfahan looked nothing like it, but I suppose that's too much to expect. First the whole time line is wrong, Ibn Sina lived during the ruling of Saljugi dynasty and was caught up in their wars. He had to be on the run all the time for most of his life. The most important blunder of the movie which was quite central to the storyline is that Ibn Sina did not practice autopsy! He did! It was considered a sin so he had to steel corpses during the night. It is one of the reasons why people didn't like him. I have not read the book, I am talking about real documented history about him so maybe this blunder can be blamed on the book. I don't know!",/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2014,siderite,9," Wondrous movie, about the good old days. Sort of :)
","The two hours and a half movie has a lot of good things going for it. First there is the acting, coming from people that are mostly quite unknown, but which is good even for actors in secondary roles. Stellan Skarsgård and Ben Kingsley do, as expected, a great job. Then there are the landscapes, starting from wet green Britain and ending in the Arabian desert. But of course, the best of it all is the story.",/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2014,ali_besharatian,1," Inaccurate, flashy, lavishly produced, and ridiculously stupid.
","Not only is this film historically inaccurate, but it is also terribly unlikely, childish and ridiculously stupid. It tells the story of an uneducated English barber, who (with no knowledge of Persian, Arabic, Hebrew, and more importantly, no knowledge of philosophy, mathematics, medicine, etc. and perhaps a total illiterate), disguised as a Jew, travels to Isfahan to seek medicine training from the greatest physician of the world, Avicenna.

14 December 2014,claudio_carvalho,9," One of the Best Adventures of 2014
","In the Eleventh Century, in England, the mother of the boy Rob Cole has side sickness (appendicitis) and he foresees her death when he touches her. The orphan Rob is alone and he follows a traveling barber-surgeon (Stellan Skarsgård) that teaches him how to cure the needy. When the barber is blind with cataract, Rob Cole seeks out a Jewish physician that recovers the barber's vision.",/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2015,alchemist-714-680589,9," Well shot and acted, not very true to the original story.
","While this movie is well acted and beautifully shot, there are so many departures from the original story that I couldn't help feeling a little let down. It's true that to include everything written by Noah Gordon would require a mini-series (which would have been a good idea) , there are a number of things that gave the story more depth that could easily have been included. An accurate account of where Rob J Cole was born would have been a good start.",/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2014,roobi-92,1," This movie is a very good in visual effect but it is really bad in giving the right story.
","First of all, If one wants to write about history you must make an effort to read about it. Even- though I don't read about Rob Cole any where in Ibn Sina's history, still I can bear adding him to the story but not not giving him all the credit to Ibn Sina's work. Everyone must knows or even heard about Ibn Sina, in the medical field. People still studying his work. ",/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2016,s-parsi2005,8," total disappointment in staying true to historical site but fun to watch
",I start from the story i gave it a 8 because it was fun to watch an exciting journey but honestly as a science student i know that the portrait of Aveccina was totally wrong. He died from a disease that he easily treated at that time but since he was always taking care of patients he never paid attention to his health. at the old age he had already achieved an amazing level in medical science that has never repeated in history of mankind. he was a genius at only very young age he had mastered all scholar texts of his time. they could merely put focus on the young English physician and show that Avicenna actually supervise the surgery not learn it! totally ridiculous scene! such a shame! if anyone wants to know the accurate history site watch Bou Ali Sina TV series made in persian in 70s i have watched it over and over and i cant get enough even if it looks pretty old but still amazing to watch maybe available in Eng from ifilm.,/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2014,maria-pervez11,5," Film is good but History is altered
","I just watch the movie and from movie point of view its really a very nice one. But what i didn't like and i'm amazed why such thing be written and them made a movie of which includes history and an altered one. Ibn Sina was a great Muslim scientist who has expertise in Medicine, Phylosophy, Metaphysics and many more. He died early and not by suicide but by a natural death. If instead of Ibn Sine they had used some other fictional Muslim name, a fictional place and fiction Shaw then that would be understandable but writing the wrong history, by altering not only a lot of facts and figures and then making a movie out of it is not good ethically and morally. I guess any historical publications and movies should go through some check before being released unless such things are done on purpose.",/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2014,z-ajmal759,10," Message of Hope
","Whether this movie is filmed on real story or not(that is not by the way as another view describes the facts in details), i saw this movie as message of hope to anyone who wants to achieve his goal.",/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2014,amehmetbey,4," Great movie but another twisted history
",In terms of filming this is a great movie but I am really sad to see again that film makers intentionally try to show Muslim's and Islam as evil as a fashion. Which makes ignorant people filled with hatred which is rising the tension between civilizations. Historically the story is twisted. Ibn-Sina as he was born in Uzbekistan was Turkish origin while he was really one of the greatest scientist at his time and been know as the origin of modern medicine of the western world so the whole world. And Seljuk's who were also a Turkish tribe been there about 50 years later after Ibn-Sina's death. Seljuk's were great warriors but they were not evil as shown in this movie besides Seljuk's were extremely merciful to people under their rule and they build a great civilization and known to be good supporters of science and art of their time. Even today after a 1000 years their architecture stands in the countries they ruled.,/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2013,FPAlpha,3," Unfortunately not worth your time

27 June 2014,Vincentiu,," almost more than a movie
","a beautiful novel. a great cast. splendid music. more than a good adaptation or remarkable work, it is an useful message about basic values of society. a film about tolerance as fruit of courage, about love and friendship as results of sacrifice. about vocation. all in seductive package. Ben Kingsley as Avicenna, Olivier Martinez as the shah, Tom Payne as lead actor are pillars of a wise, touching, subtle show.and they are not the only - the flavor of Arabian Nights is, in same measure, admirable ingredient. more than a film, it is a sort of delight. and a lesson out of didacticism laws. that fact is fundamental. for viewer. and for understand the delicate axis behind its beauty.",/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2014,Jawad-hamad,1," distorted story of a great scientist and physician
","I was very much disappointed and frustrated, in fact, after I watched this movie. ABCs of making movies about the past, READ HISTORY before you start bullshi$tting people. ",/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2013,eickhoff-jens,9," Beautiful and entertaining

16 March 2021,kerrysimpson-62755,8," Loved it
","I have never read the book so had no idea what to expect. I really enjoyed it, kept my attention all the way through . Bonus was Tom Payne and Stellan Skaarsgard along with Ben Kingsley.",/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2014,ahmad_waqar1987,1," Who does not know that the first law of historical writing is the truth
",Movie was good but writer try to misguide the audience. In movie Ibn Sina commit suicide but in real not. According to wiki he died in bed not by taking poison. And also one of the most biggest mistake was that the life span of Ibn sina and Shah Ala ad-Daula. Ibn Sina was died in June 1037 and Shah Ala ad-Daula was died in 1156 but in movie they show Ibn sina commit suicide and Shah was killed in battle approximately same day or same week. A country without a memory is a country of madmen. So in my opinion movie was good but blunder with the history. In the end I must says that History is a tool used by politicians to justify their intentions.,/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2016,whitequeen71,9," a wonderful fantasy story
","VERY VERY loosely based on 'Medicus' by Noah Gordon, a book I read twice and which I love very much. Other reviewers have already spoken about the historical inaccuracy of the movie so I will not go into details. I don't like it either, BUT, if you consider this movie a fantasy tale set in a medieval-like world, it's a wonderful compelling story with well written characters and great actors. I decided to forget the movie was based on a book I love and that it was supposed to be set in a particular moment in real history, and I enjoyed it very much. I also fell in love with the Shah, a character that you are brought to hate and despise in the beginning and that you love and admire in the end (when he closely resembles the Asian version of Aragorn oh my God what a man). I loved Ben Kingsley's performance and the way Ibn Sina was portrayed despite the historical inaccuracy, the scene of his death included, very poetic and moving. I tend to like movies with my heart and soul as well as with my mind, and since I cared for the characters and in the end I was moved to tears, I give it a 9/10",/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2014,planktonrules,9," Almost perfect.
","The Physician is one of the best epic adventure films I've ever seen— there that pretty much says it. However, the folks at Influx will not allow single-sentence reviews, so I suppose I should talk about the movie a bit and explain why I enjoyed it so much.",/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2015,snickerfoot,9," good movie
","Really people! This was a good movie! Its entertainment. I did not watch this for historical value. Since movies are always,always altered for impact, even a work of fiction. If I wanted to know the true accounting of someones life I would read a history book. But this movie made me want to know the truth about this history because it change the way medicine advanced and in turn Life. Again, movies are for letting someone enjoy time away from a ordinary Life. No 10..a little long but they don't have 9 1/2 and in order to tell this story we needed to see all of what was shown. If you watch movies not documentaries and even then, don't expect the truth. Movie: story or event recorded by a camera as a set of moving images and shown in a theater or on television; a motion picture. Stop harping on political,social injustice, and religious inconsistencies and just enjoy the MOVIE.",/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2014,matheusortega,10," Interesting Thoughts
","A film worth watching, a journey worth embarking. Although it is not 100% historically accurate, the film is set in medieval times and portrays the scientific advances in midst of the ideological conflict between the Christian, Muslim, and the Jewish world. There are many important lessons that this film teaches. It raises difficult moral questions and the conflicts between religious moderate and extremists. In a time when scientific discoveries were not encouraged by the Catholic Church, the main character - a young believer in Christ - explores the world to find answers to human pain and sickness. I recommend it specially for those who enjoy the debates of science and religion, and the complex philosophical questions we all need to reflect upon.",/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2020,henry-405,1," Which one was Ibn Sina?
","When someone writes about someone, whoever s/he is , s/he should at least 'try' to make his book/movie at least looks realistic and makes sense. If it is about entertainment, then do not try to Invent fictional story about scientists, try to talk about some fictional character.
Or mention at the beginning that this is not a true story.",/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2015,evehands,7," Beautifully filmed and staged, but not for the squeamish...
","or anyone English with a modicum of knowledge of History! Because that final shot of London with the completed Tower of London - after the movie clearly stated it started in the year 1021 - was SO jarring, it really ruined the ending for me, personally! This after 2 and a half hours of successfully suspending disbelief over so many maybe-it-'twas-really-so (i.e. back then in the 11th century) moments in scenes so attractively staged and nicely acted, that I was willing to believe them: But that willingness was shot with that final shot! :( Beautiful film but a BIG mistake to cast the relatively unknown Tom Payne in the leading role, IMO; though certainly NOT recommending the makers cast Shia LaBeouf or one of the Jonas bros (!?!) - HOWEVER, the star power of Ben Kingsley was undeniable and made poor Mr. Payne pale by comparison beside himwhich is not what one wants, surely, from one's primary (and in almost every scene) player?",/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2014,abantelman,10," Visually stunning and emotionally poignant film- forget the book and appreciate it for what it is!
","I am very disappointed at the negativity surrounding this film. I always believe that when you have a read a book that is made into a film, you have to look at them as separate works of art. This film is, in its own rite, a beautiful story told with superb acting. I was entertained and captivated throughout the entire film, which tells the tale of a young boy who is driven to become a physician after watching his own mother pass away before his eyes.",/review/rw2940783/?ref_=tt_urv
