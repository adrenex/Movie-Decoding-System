22 October 2018,AlsExGal,8," Elegant and painfully passionate
","There were many scenes in this movie that stuck with me, most of which have probably been discussed to death (the dad, the peach, the sheer pleasure of sitting around reading, swimming, and doing whatever you want unsupervised).",/review/rw3846805/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2018,TheLittleSongbird,10," The joy and pain of love and desire
","Saw 'Call Me By Your Name' as someone trying to see as many films from 2017 as possible, because same sex love has been portrayed beautifully more than once and because it was one of the best received films of the year with a lot of award attention as we speak.",/review/rw3846805/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2018,Sebastien02,10," A touching romance
","« Call me by your name » is a beautiful movie about first love. The atmosphere is dreamy and I have been taken on an emotional journey for two hours. Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer give remarkable performances. There is a great chemistry between them. The charming landscapes, the good soundtrack and the delicate direction also contribute to this achievement. I like the way homosexuality is portrayed: being gay is normal; there is no drama queen and no pathos. This is a touching story that makes me want to fall in love.",/review/rw3846805/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2017,howard.schumann,10," It is about compassion, trust, and wisdom
","Chiron, in Barry Jenkins' Oscar-winning film ""Moonlight,"" in addition to being gay and black, has to deal with drug abuse, bullying, and the lack of a supportive home environment. In contrast, in Luca Guadagnino's (""A Bigger Splash"") achingly beautiful Call Me by Your Name, 17-year-old Elio's (Timothée Chalamet, ""Love the Coopers"") life is safe, comfortable, and surrounded by love though, like Chiron, he must come to terms with his true identity. Written by three-time Oscar nominee James Ivory and adapted from the 2007 novel by Andre Aciman, Call Me by Your Name is set in the summer of 1983 where Oliver (Armie Hammer, ""Free Fire"") is an American research assistant studying with art history Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg, ""Steve Jobs"") at Perlman's gorgeous villa in Northern Italy.",/review/rw3846805/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2017,paulfairbanksusa,10," It happens when you least expect it
","Beauty in the midst of all the ugliness we're living in, it's like a shock. I wept like I hadn't wept in a movie since I was very young. It made me think and remember summers of my own life. It made remember sounds and smells. I was transported. The smartness, candor and gentleness of this unexpected love story goes beyond anything I've ever seen. Luca Guadagnino is rapidly becoming one my favorite directors working today. Armie Hammer completely demolished my preconceptions with a performance that is total perfection and I haven't mention Timothee Chalamet yet. No I need to dedicate the lasts paragraphs to him because his performance goes beyond perfection. I didn't know him at all. Now I' a fan. It reminded me of the first time I saw Daniel Day Lewis playing a gay punk in ""My Beautiful Launderette"" An explosion of beauty when you least expected. Thank you for that.",/review/rw3846805/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2017,borromeot,10," Timothee Chalamet
","I cried my eyes out. It was cleansing and reinvigorating. Timothee Chalamet is the living image of a friend from my childhood. He had a similar experience but a very different outcome and it made me think with a broken heart that if my friend had had a father like Elio's father he could have had a real chance at a happy, constructive life, instead of the agonizing pain that he went through. I hadn't though about him for years and Timothee brought him back to me with enormous power. What a beautiful, beautiful performance. Armie Hammer is a total revelation, the perfect foil for a first love. Michael Stuhlbarg introduces us to a character I had never seen on the screen before. He moved me no end, Then, of course, Luca Guadagnino. My hat to you sir. This is a film I will see many times.",/review/rw3846805/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2017,The-Awesome-One,10," A masterpiece that will stay with you long after the credits

13 January 2019,punch_p,10," Call Me By Your Name is an unapologetic celebration of emotion.

2 February 2017,mcs26891,," A Cinematic Classic
","How can any review rightfully describe Call Me By Your Name? I had the immense privilege of seeing it at Sundance before 99.99% of the world, so now I am one of the select few in charge of p(r)eaching the gospel that is Call Me By Your Name. This film is simply a masterpiece, possibly the best romance film of all time, and one of the best films of all time as well.",/review/rw3846805/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2017,candelach,10," Sensual Italian summer
","This film is pure sensuality and emotion. You can see through the character's eyes, taste through their mouths but most importantly you feel, by God how you feel. Luca Guadagnino manages to extract the very best out of his actors: Armie Hammer's performance shows unprecedented depth and Timothee Chalamet is the essence of awe inspiring acting, this film will land him an Oscar nomination at the very least.",/review/rw3846805/?ref_=tt_urv

14 December 2018,linoayumu,10," Truly one of the best.
","It doesn't take a genius to understand nor appreciate this film. It does however, take an open mind to see and feel the beauty this film has to offer. It is perfection incarnate. Never have I been so moved by a film such as this one. It was an absolute pleasure watching it.",/review/rw3846805/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2017,PotassiumMan,9," Summer love discovered, explored and never forgotten
","I am usually quick to start focusing on the next film as soon as I've finished one, but here is a rare exception that I prefer to let linger on for a while even at the risk of my memory of it becoming unremarkable. That's because it's one of the most subtly affecting and beautiful love stories that I've seen in years. A low-key pace and a sumptuous musical score build the film to a conclusion that is truly flawless.",/review/rw3846805/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2018,dmasursky,5," Yes, Italy is beautiful
","I finally saw this Oscar nominee (just one week before the award show!) and I was so disappointed - it was long, slow, and not very romantic. And I don't think a director should get any credit for making Italy look beautiful! Apparently in the book, Oliver is 24, but Armie Hammer is 31, and he looks it, and his age is rather distracting because the relationship borders on inappropriate already, but those extra years make the relationship even less appealing. The men take forever to connect and it's not like you're really rooting for them. Elio is a spoiled brat who spends most of his time glowering at everyone. He even expresses his desultory attitude to Oliver in an early conversation - he clearly has no idea how privileged he is, to lounge around Italy all summer, doing whatever he wants, unaccountable to his indulgent parents. As an audience member, I wasn't very invested in his getting his supposed heart's desire. Nor did the men have much chemistry. Oliver says late in the movie, ""I love the way you say things."" I thought, what? How many conversations did they even have? Mostly they road bikes, and went swimming, and laid in the grass. Elio's father speech, which so many consider a highlight of the film, I found contrived - like what the writer imagined his father would say, or what he wished his father had said - about how pure his love with Oliver was. I have seen many films that I think portray that first love experience in a more compelling way for the audience (I would strongly recommend Beautiful Thing if you're a fan of this genre). I gave it 5 stars for boldness and great performances. The very best movie of the year? Um, no. I was expecting something much more charming and moving.",/review/rw3846805/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2019,iemdeboer,10," A piece of perfect cinema
","Now, where to begin... Pretty much everything I feel about this film has been mentioned here before. But boy did it make me FEEL, from the opening credits right through the end credits. It made my heart soar and sink with its colours, scenery, music, and above all else its acting. The phenomenon that is Chalamet was yet unknown to me, and Hammer I'd only seen in a bad chickflick, so it would be an understatement to say I was pleasantly surprised by how they performed.
There's so much detail as well, from the inquisitive and knowing looks of a mother, to the picturesqueness of a ladder against the fruittree. Everything about this film draws you in. If I could dream up memories of a hot Italian summer in a rural hamlet, this would be it, I swear I could almost smell and taste this film. Luca Guadagnino made a masterpiece here and I highly doubt it will ever be surpassed in its category.",/review/rw3846805/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2017,bastille-852-731547,10," An Extraordinary, Extraordinarily Unforgettable Masterwork of Filmmaking
","I loved ""A Bigger Splash"" (the previous film by Luca Guadagnino,) and was in awe by the trailer and stunning reviews for this film. Needless to say, my expectations were utterly shattered by this powerful, emotional, and gorgeous drama. It's one of the best films of the decade, and clearly the best film of the year so far.",/review/rw3846805/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2020,dvlbr,10," There are no words to describe it.
","Just finished watching Call Me by Your Name, and yes, I'm a little late. I'm just going to start by saying that this is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen in my whole life. There are so many factors that play a central role in my final judgment, and of course I'm gonna analyse and talk about them, but being an italian boy who grew up in southern Italy, there are a lot of references that make this movie a masterpiece.",/review/rw3846805/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2017,pollak1000,5," Disappointing
","I really wanted to like this film. I read the book when it came out; I am a gay man; I love films about love relationships between beautiful men; I love films with bits of European languages and lovely European settings; I am 'pro' art house films which are all about characters and take their time. But this didn't work. Firstly, it was really too long. But my main problem was that the relationship between Elio and Oliver just didn't ring true. OK, a few small things happened between them which could have been seen as sexual (e.g. the shoulder massage), but they were both busy doing things with women a lot. Nothing wrong with being bi! And Elio is meant to be young, finding himself etc. But one day, he suddenly says to Oliver that he needs to tell him something, and Oliver says he knows what it is - but there really hasn't been enough evidence of that building up. I do realise that reading an article about Hammer which said that he had a clause added to his contract restricting the amount of sex and nudity he would be expected to do - well that made me struggle to see sincerity in his acting. Chalumet on the other hand is a great discovery. The way he holds a close-up all through the closing titles, showing a range of emotions, is very impressive indeed. I can remember so clearly what it was like at 17 (OK yes, 50 years ago) to kind of enjoy feeling sad and then elated about love and sex, and Chalumet shows that brilliantly. But he is not enough to save this film, and nor is the man playing his father, who does such an excellent job of channelling Robin Williams.",/review/rw3846805/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2018,gphgrm01,2," Weird and overrated
","I guess watching this film is fairly different for people who have read the book by now, but for me, this film is highly disappointing and, occasionally even disturbing. First of all, the cast for Oliver character is deeply problematic. Not because Army Hammer is a bad actor. On contrary, I think he is all right in general. However, the role simply does not suit him. Oliver should be just a few years older than Elio, while Hammer looks like (at least) 15 year older than a younger actor, and on the screen there is a striking encounter of a grown up, bored older man seducing a half his age ( and still under age) boy. That is a disturbing dimension of the film that probably does not strike in the book, but it attracts too much attention in the film, and looks disturbing. ",/review/rw3846805/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2017,gortx,," Luca Guadagnino's tender film fills the senses
","Luca Guadagnino is one of our most sensual filmmakers. CALL ME BY YOUR NAME, like his previous A BIGGER SPLASH and I AM LOVE are filled with scenes touching upon all the senses. Guadagnino gorgeously captures images of beautiful objects, locations, books and, of course, the pleasures of the flesh. His soundtracks are filled with the sounds of nature as well as overflowing with music (usually classical, but, with more modern nods to the Rolling Stones and the Psychedelic Furs). His characters luxuriate with the smells of food and they caress the world around them.",/review/rw3846805/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2017,joshbarton15,10," Summer loving'... had me a blast

24 December 2020,naimaislamnodi,8," A beautiful, heart touching love story.
","Although I am a straight person, I loved this movie in all the ways. A beautiful, heart warming love story, makes me want to fall in love again again. This movie gives me the feeling that there is nothing more wonderful than falling in love for the first time. The cinematography, sound track, adopted screenplay is perfect. I personally loved the acting of Timothee Chalamet, wonderful. It makes me feel that being homo sexual is perfectly normal, there is nothing wrong about it, Absolutely perfect..",/review/rw3846805/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2017,davidgee,8," Summer of gay love
","After years of famine this is feast year for gay picture-goers: two gay love stories in two months. Scripted by James Ivory and directed by Luca Guadagnino, CALL ME BY YOUR NAME has all the rich texture and subtlety of a 'classic' Merchant-Ivory production. It's 1983 and 17-year-old Elio Perlman (Timothee Chalamet) is spending the summer at his parents' house in Northern Italy. A hunky American graduate (Arnie Hammer) arrives to help his professor father with archaeological research. Elio develops a crush on the charismatic Oliver who, reluctantly at first, reciprocates. A summer of intense passion is bound to have a short lease as Oliver has to go back to the States.",/review/rw3846805/?ref_=tt_urv
