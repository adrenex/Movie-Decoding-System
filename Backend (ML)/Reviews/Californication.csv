30 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,9," I missed Dexter so much but the ending was awful!
","I missed Dexter so much and was so excited to hear that it was getting revived for this series. Dexter is easily one of my favorite shows of all-time and one of the few shows I can watch all the way through several times over without getting bored. Dexter: New Blood is actually pretty good until the ending. The ending to the original was pretty bad but this ending is actually worse. I'm not one of those people who thinks a bad ending ruins the whole series for me, as long as the series was good overall then I don't downgrade the entire series because of one bad show. But if there's any exception this show is it. The ending really is that bad. I'd still recommend this to any Dexter fans just to see Michael C. Hall back as Dexter. That's worth watching alone. Just be prepared to be disappointed at the ending.",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Another Terrible Ending!
","The original Dexter was absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best shows ever created! It's a thrilling, one of a kind TV show that will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. Michael C. Hall is perfect as Dexter and the rest of the supporting cast is just as fantastic! Yes, the ending was terrible but like Game of Thrones, Lost (or any other show with a bad final episode), a few bad episodes at the end doesn't spoil what an overall great show it was and that's what Dexter is...a GREAT show! The ending was so bad they brought back Dexter: New Blood to give it a better ending. Problem is the ending to this was even worse. I've loved having Dexter back on my tv and the show was really good overall, they just blew the ending for a second time. It's still definitely worth watching!",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,Lukasmj,8," Overall good, but again a terrible final...
","""Dexter: New Blood"" was a sequel that I was really looking forward to.",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2021,gedikreverdi,," Michael C. Hall deserves more appreciation
",Michael C. Hall is such a good actor. We need to appreciate him more. Nothing much happened but there's an atmosphere of foreboding and uneasiness and that reminds me very much of good old times when I got to watch Dexter without knowing I was watching one of the best shows in my life.,/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,Aesafern,8," Give the people what they want! No.
","This Dexter revival is a slow burn before getting red hot and then nosediving into a disappointing end. If you're like me and you love Dexter and was looking forward to watching this limited series, don't do it because you might not like the ending. I didn't, it was uninspiring and weak.",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,persian-belle,8," Interesting but different (I still prefer the original Dexter)
","Interesting, however not the same as the old/original Dexter series.",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2021,UniqueParticle,10," Spectacular reboot to one of my favorite shows
","So much charm same as original series, I love everything they've done with it so far and blessed to see more of Micheal C. Hall! The Dark Passenger still flows ever so smooth through a new area with his rules intact. One of the best soundtracks ever that makes me so happy enticed for more to come; hell yes Dexter Morgan!",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2022,tuanskie,8," Final episode reset needed!
","I had never watched Dexter until I binged through this particular series. I gave the series an overall rating of 8 because it hooked me into going backwards in watching Dexter from the very beginning. All I can say is that the final episode of this limited run series is disappointing to say the least and deserves a 1/10. I echo what others have already stated - what's the point? Please ShowTime, do a reshoot of the episode and magically wipe out the hideous storyline and treatment Dexter received. A large number of us will be glad to pretend ""it"" never happened! Heck, it'll be awesome if the son never happened!",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2022,Js-bingewatcher,8," Overall a great comeback but the ending killed it
","Overall a great comeback, I was a huge Dexter fan and I was thrilled when this series came out but sadly the ending killed it, I'm not sure if any Dexter fan would agree with the ending!!!",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2021,cscott2331,10," The Dark Passenger is back!!
","Great start. I'm going to forgive and forget how the previous series ended and start anew. I refuse to let the final episode take away the awesomeness that was Dexter. I was excited they jumped right in. I'm sure we'll get lots more backstory on the way, but all I needed to know was Dexter Morgan was still in there...and he is! Even the musical score was spot on! Can't wait to see what dark Journey we're taken on this season. Bring it on Dexter!! I'm ready!",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,thiwankar1,7," Should not have been made
","Very heartbreaking ending, I was expecting more from the final. I liked the way things they left after season 8. This feels like a meaningless story to tell. I personally didn't need to know he get killed, I mean by his son. How messed up is that? We see how much Dexter loves Harrison in the original show, and it ends up like this. This should have been left alone. All the 7 stars for Michael C hall. He was excellent as always. I still cant believe it though, my favorite character is dead only by the hands of my least favorite character. Now I cant even re-watch the original show knowing this horrible ending. Writers can go f themselves.",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2022,vinaydivakar,8," The last episode - why, why, why????
","If you liked the original show, you'd like this one too. I enjoyed all the episodes except for the last one. I was very disappointed to see Dexter got killed by his son Harrison. I'd hate to watch Harrison take over the role. However, for the 9 episodes and for old times sake, I'd give it a decent rating.",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2022,AudioFileZ,6," Ending Again...For Good?
","Dexter was a series that introduced and developed a very interesting character. Certainly not a ""me too"" show as it felt totally original. Dexter was a fresh anti-villain that challenged the viewer to like a very flawed man. It succeeded well with insidious criminals that Dexter's code took care of. The show may have overstayed it's freshness somewhat in the latter seasons admittedly but it really was for a lot of us in for a penny, in for a pound. It kept this viewer watching more and more because of Dexter's world constantly being threatened to come down. At first the ending felt wrong as a cheap out, but I felt the writers had taken the characters as far as could be expected and opting for the closure taken made more sense.",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2022,danielcereto,5," EPISODE 10 RUINS EVERYTHING
","The original Dexter's series is a masterpiece from beginning till the end, but it was true the ending was not really good for mostly fans including me.",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2022,S-t-a-t-i-x,," Ending ruined it
",Dexter: New Blood quickly felt like Dexter again. I was enjoying it more and more until the last 10-15 minutes of the final episode. I can't believe they did it again. They freaking did it again... Once more they ruined it with the ending.,/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2021,myronlearn,9," Dexter Saga Continues
","I was big 'Dexter' fan and when the series ended some 8 years ago, I thought it concluded well. When I read they were doing a 'Dexter' sequel, I was very dubious, believing that it would be better just to leave well enough alone. Sequels generally are disappointing.",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,frozen_dawn,9," Makes up for season 8 amazingly, but COULD it fix the ending?
","Like many of you, after a much weaker season to say the very least, I really hated the original final episode of this great show. Actually it's probably still to this day the worst finale I've ever seen in a TV series. To the point that the original showrunner came back to try and give it a better send off.",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2022,Rob-O-Cop,8," Pretty good apart from the end
",There was a lot they got right with this series.,/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2021,Tactrix,9," Building Up
","Slow start but the feel is pretty similar to the original. I really can't stand Deb in this one, harry was at least helpful, all Deb seems to do in this one is scream and yell at Dexter. The other thing that bothered me with both the original series and this one is fact that Dexter is always looking for ways to get rid of bodies. For anyone else that might be a thing, but he's literally a forensics expert, he spent most of his life in science, if anyone should know how to melt a body to nothing it should be him.",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2021,arnab_911,9," Reboots are always messy; not this one
","I was disappointed that they let Dexter live after hurricane Laura. Disappointment turned into pleasure with the finesse the reboot kicked off. Dexter's breaking point, the urges, the onion like layers of his new life merging with his old life was actually pretty dope. Harry, Dexter's father moulded him creatively, it's to be seen what Dexter does with that gift!",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2022,df16699n,10," Excellent Reboot
","It's hard for an iconic television series to be rebooted and be successful. For 9 episodes Dexter: New Blood was fantastic. The last episode is another story, but I'll give it a pass. When this reboot was announced I didn't know what to expect, I definitely didn't think it was necessary, but I was still very excited. This season exceeded my expectations in every way and I loved nearly every second of it. It is not as good as peak Dexter, but it is still a very entertaining season from start to finish. Finale aside, I honestly think this season could not have gone any better for a reboot. There are some nice callbacks to the original series, as well as a great new villain in Kurt Caldwell, played by Clancy Brown of SpongeBob Squarepants and Shawshank Redemption fame. It's hard to go wrong with Michael C. Hall, he is just phenomenal as Dexter Morgan and it was a pure treat to see him return to the role.",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,julieshotmail,7," Not enough episodes to make you really care about any of the new characters
","""Dexter: New Blood"" by all means is an exhilarating premise - you get to be taken back to one of the most iconic shows to grace the TV screen in the mid to late 2000s before streaming was a thing. The character Dexter puts you in a rather complicated and awkward position of rooting for a serial killer. That's because the original series invests the time to form a sympathetic backstory, and it effectively creates the nuances of a charming Dexter that keeps you interested in what happens to him. The same goes for most or all of the supporting characters who are properly given sufficient stories and screen time that you also care about them. Unfortunately, the 10 episodes of ""New Blood"" do not succeed in making any of the other characters sympathetic and really likable. Either the season is too short, or the characters themselves, from Angela to even Harrison, lack proper development. By the end, the only real sympathetic character is still only Dexter, so you continue to root for him but without conflict because you could care less about the other characters.",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2022,Meeka_Meek,9," Tough Crowd...
","They had me at ""hello Dexter Morgan ""
I waited years for this reboot and I am far from disappointed. Most all of us can say the ending in the original Dexter was bad because it left so many doors open. Dexter New blood didn't. Although I would have LOVED 3-4 more seasons of New Blood the ending was quite poetic and beautiful! I have no more questions I know now what happened to Dex, Harrison , Hannah and Batista .",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2022,eva3si0n,6," Dexter: New Blood wasn't supposed to come out
","Dexter: New Blood wasn't supposed to come out. Dexter: New Blood only disappoints as a result. Yes, in general, if we consider season 9 as a separate project, it is not bad, and you can watch it very much. But if you consider the series as a whole, then this is an extra season. Season 8 ended with dignity. As for Dexter: New Blood itself, there is no good and intelligible antagonist, there is no interesting story. If you're a big fan of the original series, it hurts you to watch it.",/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2022,antide-42376,5," Was there any point?
",It is obvious that this series was made because they should have killed off Dexter in the last one. To be blunt this wasn't great and the ending was unbelievably stupid.,/review/rw7746505/?ref_=tt_urv
