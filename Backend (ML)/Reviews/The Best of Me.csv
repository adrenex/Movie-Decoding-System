17 September 2022,gavinp9,7," Different, but fitting, overview of one of the greats
","'Moonage Daydream' is a not-really-documentary about David Bowie, as it doesn't follow the traditional talking heads of friends, family and colleagues. It's also not a concert film, although it does have some live concert footage, apparently much of it previously unseen. Directed by Brett Morgen (who did 'Montage of Heck' about Kurt Cobain and 'Crossfire Hurricane' about The Rolling Stones), it's also not wall-to-wall songs - I'd say there were only ~10 songs played in full, with lots of others used as transitions.",/review/rw8698212/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,Mikecizi123,10," It's not a biography, it's a senses attack.
","Saw this in IMAX 2d. Loud, vivid, it's not a biography, it's an exploration and celebration of Bowie's life, art, and music. Made up of clips cleverly edited together and enhanced to make this a cinematic experience . See it as big and loud as you can and get lost in Bowie. It needs to be three hours longer to fit in everything the stuff others are moaning about not being there. I'd happily have done another 3 hours of this. Came out wanting to listen to all the album's again and smoke cigarettes and bleach my hair and wear a raincoat. Everything i wanted to be in the eighties, I want again after watching Bowie come to life once more.",/review/rw8698212/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,fostrhod,10," Montage Daydream
","David Bowie Moonage Daydream. 2hours 18 mins of Bowie, it's not your usual "" talking heads"" bigging up some old/ dead/ has been rock star who has a reissued album to flog. It's just Bowie, well it isn't? It's a beautifully compiled fast edited montage of Bowie, his music, visuals, interviews both on screen on audio and various clips of his many many influences. What I learnt about Bowie, he was constantly striving for his art, he was some times lost (mainly during his successful periods) and like all of us he wished could have more time towards the end. Most importantly he was really happy at the end of his life both emotionally, creatively and spiritually. There are loads of previously unseen clips and lots of unheard mixes of songs. Ps I love Bowie, 1980 I bought my first Bowie album on the day of its release (Scary Monsters) and I never looked back. If your not a fan I don't know how you'd take it, it's a fascinating work of art and totally enthralling so I'd give it 10/10 if your not a fan give it a watch and perhaps you'll see why people where heart broken when he passed away. Listen out for ""Cygnet committee"" there's a lovely choral version at the end, and watch until the end of the credits, David will speak just to you.",/review/rw8698212/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,scotrep,7," An assault on the senses
","There's much to like here. Visually interesting and it gave me a deeper appreciation of Bowie as a person. Some very sage quotes and sound bites. At one point I felt quite sad and thought Bowie was quite lonely/dissatisfied with life, but then the film ended with some brilliant statements from the man himself.",/review/rw8698212/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,Jeremy_Urquhart,8," Definitely not your average music documentary
","It was always going to be hard to capture David Bowie's life and career in documentary format, as even the standard, talking head interviews + archive footage in chronological order would fail to capture all the important information in just over two hours. More troubling, however, is the fact that an ordinary documentary wouldn't do justice to who Bowie was/wasn't/might've been. He had an eccentric and still somewhat mysterious life, adopting different personas that all had some relation to his true self, yet never seemed to perfectly reflect it.",/review/rw8698212/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2022,azdinak,6," The Gospel According to Morgen
","Brett Morgen's ""Moonage Daydream"" is a highly selective, fawning portrait of seminal rock artist David Bowie. Its sheer length, the fact that it is told almost entirely in Bowie's own words, and was authorized by his estate, suggest it should be the last word on the subject. Instead what we get is a cinematic personal essay both windy and frenetic, the Bowie Gospel According to Morgen. While many of Bowie's pronouncements are useful and enlightening, it's also useful to remember that Bowie was always, to use a literary term, an unreliable narrator who changed his positions as often as he changed his wardrobe. The film does not shy entirely away from this, limning Bowie's seesaw craving for both fame and artistic credibility from episode to episode. Well, he achieved both, bless him.",/review/rw8698212/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,james-patrick-732-463468,8," A Love Letter to Bowie
","I'm not sure I would call ""Moonage Daydream"" a documentary. It's visually captivating and absolutely a must for every Bowie fan. This movie felt more like a ride than a movie. The HBO documentary Five Years was far superior in terms of a linear examination of the last years of Bowie's life. I went into this expecting or hoping for the same. I wasn't really a fan of Brett Morgan's Nirvana film ""Montage of Heck"" and I found ""Moonage Daydream"" to be told in a similar fashion. The only difference is Bowie is my favorite artist of all time. I would say Morgan focused more on ""Sound and Vision"" than story. My biggest issue with this film is the repeat usage of footage while Morgan failing to cover Bowie from the years 1997-2016. I just think of all the footage from the ""Heathen"", ""The Next Day"" and ""Black Star"" that should've been incorporated instead of showing us clips we had already seen. It made me question if Morgan was the right person for the job. He did manage to squeeze in a few minutes of the ""Blackstar"" video. But Bowie's triumphant return with ""The Next Day"" and still managing to offend people with his take on androgyny and religious expression, well into his 60s by now, was left on the cutting room floor. Still, will I see ""Moonage Daydream"" another 2-3 times? Without question. It's David Bowie on an IMAX screen! So sit back and enjoy the ride!",/review/rw8698212/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,spookyrat1,6," Underwhelming!
","Brett Morgen's 140 minute long Moonage Daydream, is a neon-soaked nonlinear joyride through the late David Bowie's life and career, concentrating on his personal philosophy to life and art, as narrated wholly and solely (to its detriment) by the man himself. Bowie freaks and acolytes will I imagine, bow down before it, declaring it the best thing since sliced bread and vinyl music. I on the other hand, as a fan of his music, found its perspective of the great man and musician to be too narrow and dare I say it, despite some exhilarating sequences, even boring in places.",/review/rw8698212/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,ccarry-62728,5," Horribly pretentious...
","This is NOT the filmic epitaph Bowie deserved. I feel like a heretic writing this (I'm a DB fan for nearly 50 years) however, and it's nothing to do with Bowie, he literally had no producer or directorial input here, it's just a series of jump cuts, flash edits and (non DB) content that was just irritating. There was also a lot of previously seen footage (from 'Richochet' or 'Cracked Actor').",/review/rw8698212/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2022,aksoyduru,10," Incredible..
","Saw this movie on Cannes Film Festival. It was more than beautiful. Bowie was such a legend. Seeing all those scenes and songs made me feel like I was a teenager again. Although this film was nearly two hours and a half long, it wasn't boring at all. Definetly consider watching it when it comes to cinemas on 16th of September. David's face is literally so gorgerous and I recommend watching Man Who Fell To Earth (1976). It isn't great as this movie/documentary, But definetly worth watching.",/review/rw8698212/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2022,roncarrpurdue,1," Really really bad
",I was so excited and now so disappointed. They tried to represent Bowie's outlook on life by a few random things he said while going way overboard on the visuals. It may have been cool if it were only fifteen minutes. I actually got nauseous from all of the spinning gimmicks and unnecessary transitions. The theater I was in was about 60% full at the start and 25% by the end of it. They need to figure out a way to make this go away and someone needs to make a real Bowie movie. We only stayed until the end because we thought they might at least represent his later years with decency but that was not even close. So sad.,/review/rw8698212/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2022,levybob,1," I walked out.
","At forty-five minutes of 'Moonage Daydream' I walked out of the theater. I hopped in my Mini-Cooper and drove home, walked the dog, and sat down right here, and right now, to write this to you. Because once it's written I will not have to think about ""Moonage Daydream' again. Never. Again.",/review/rw8698212/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2022,sendouttheraven,10," Bowie reanimated for 2.5hrs - MAGICK!!
","Absolute MUST SEE in an IMAX theatre! Completely immersive ""cinematic experience"" really is the only way to explain it. Anyone expecting a movie/musical or a documentary will be sorely mistaken. This is so unique that no-one seems quite able to explain it to others! A work of art. A masterpiece. And I definitely think Bowie would have approved! It is 100% a film for diehard fans (nooo absolute beginners here!) If you haven't followed all stages of his life-long creative journey across many different mediums - you will get lost in the chaos. There is sooooo much packed into this: you blink = you miss. But for those of us that know....you know you know. And it feels MAGICKAL to put all those pieces of the puzzle together. Bowie was VERY much alive for those 2.5 hours - and it was EPIC! I salute you Brett for bringing this into our lives!!!",/review/rw8698212/?ref_=tt_urv

",I am a massive David Bowie fan and this was difficult to watch. The 3 stars reflect the fact that there's a lot of great footage included and it actually followed a chronological order (with a few exceptions that are likely an stylistic choice).,/review/rw8698212/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2022,aligittiomg,1," Superficial + boring
","This film didn't explain anything abt the art of bowie, it was just pretentious blabbing from the man himself mixed with live footage and other sequences. In each era that the film showed he was telling the same, so where was the growth artistically + on personal level? It got so boring after about an hour but the film kept dragging on +didn't deliver any insightful or new information. Film could really need interviews from collaborators or colleagues bc bowie himself only offered pseudo deep wisdom.",/review/rw8698212/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,chris-5864,1," It's a noisy epileptic headache
","It's an achingly repetitive car crash rehashing the same footage from YouTube; old concert performances, endless macro images of adoring fans, a couple of intercut British television chat shows and random snippets from some of his films. It's a quasi-chronological tale of his musical career. We never get the true experience and luxury of Bowie's music. The waiter grudgingly turns up with a long over due glass of wine and just as you take your first sip the waiter returns and smashes the glass out of your hand. Now repeat this experience for two hours and you come close to what it feels like painfully suffering this film.",/review/rw8698212/?ref_=tt_urv
