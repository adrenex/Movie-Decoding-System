10 March 2020,Spartan_1_1_7,9," A review of Season 3
","You know, I never imagined Netflix's Castlevania would turn out to be such a solid series back when the first season came out. Season 2 was phenomenal and Season 3 might be even better.",/review/rw6918511/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2017,urthpainter,9," Astonishing
","When I fired this up, one of the most amazing things happened. I was 5 minutes in before I openly realized the characters were voiced in English and not Japanese! And really, really good voice acting! I know there have been good American animated shows and movies made, but to me, the last time I saw such great English voice acting paired with Japanese (style) animation was the Spawn animated series. I consider that series a classic and outsider... and now we may well have another!",/review/rw6918511/?ref_=tt_urv

30 March 2020,A_Different_Drummer,10," there is a rare purity to this
","My all time favorite animated series remains AIRBENDER, but there is a rare purity to this story which is almost hypnotic. Callis as Alucard and Armitage as Belmont are nothing short of brilliant.",/review/rw6918511/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2021,kevin_robbins,10," There is nothing I don't love about this series
","Castlevania Season 1 (2017) and is available on Netflix. The storyline focuses on Dracula and his attempt to settle down with his wife when she is murdered by the local people and the church. He begins a revolution against the human race. Meanwhile, the not so innocent church forms a band of creations to treat the people like sheep and thwart Dracula's minions. A man in the middle that hates both sides may be the only hope for the human race. This series is written by comic legend Warren Ellis (Astonishing X-Men, The Authority and Batman's Grave) and contains magnificent animation, action sequences, comedy and gore. There is nothing I don't love about this series so far. It is a fun one I have started and stopped several times and my daughter and I finally sat down together to watch it all the way through...and we both adore it. This is definitely gory and full of great action and kill sequences while also having the right amount of nostalgic elements from the video game series. I strongly, strongly, strongly recommend seeing this and would score season 1 a 10/10.",/review/rw6918511/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2017,Jon-Umber,8," This is what Berserk (2016) should have been.
",Really solid production from Netflix that knows its target audience and doesn't pull any punches. Make no mistake; this is animated fare strictly for adults. And that's perfectly fine.,/review/rw6918511/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2017,matinek,10," Possibly the first good video game adaptation.
","I'll cut this short. Castlevania is only 4 episodes due to it being the prequel to the actual show, Season 2 will feature 8 episodes based on Castlevania 3. Adi Shankar might have questionable taste in makeup, but his work ethic is incredible. Every person working on Castlevania was made to play Castlevania 3 on an NES from Ebay. This show wasn't made to rake in dollars, its first and primary concern is to make it into a goddamn masterpiece and while its not finished so I really should be more responsible with the way I'm rating it, from what I've seen I'm damn impressed. The animation quality is incredible, above most Japanese anime which this show clearly mimmicks. Voice acting is perfect across the board, the action is visceral and gory, but not mindless. The story and its pacing is unique and doesn't pick up on many generic tropes. It's a unique prequel to what is yet to come. ",/review/rw6918511/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2020,jnagle811,10," The latest season keeps it up.
","The latest season keeps up the momentum of the first two seasons. I just want more, so much more. I want a 100 episode season more.",/review/rw6918511/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2019,invisibleunicornninja,7," Starts off strong.
","I watched season one and the first few episodes of season two. The beginning is pretty interesting, but over time it just gets more boring. All the technical aspects, voice acting, animation, and music are fantastic though so there's that.",/review/rw6918511/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2018,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,8," The first great video game adaptation!
",Castlevania is as iconic in gaming as Dracula is in the broader world of popular culture and horror-fandom as a whole. Usually the golden rule of thumb with video game adaptations is that they suck; and SUCK HARD! This one... doesn't. Wow; who'd have thought. Netflix has single-handedly broken new ground with just this series alone.,/review/rw6918511/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2021,KalKenobi83,9," A Fantastic Supernatural Series
","Watched Castlevania with Richard Armitage(The Hobbit Trilogy) as Trevor Belmont, Alejandra Reynoso(Dota 2) as Sypha Belenades,James Callis (Battlestar Galactica) as Adrian Tepes/Alucard, Graham McTavish (Hulk Vs) as Vlad Tepes/Dracula, Theo James(The Divergent Series) as Hector, Adetokumboh M'Cormack(Heroes) as Isaac, Jamie Murray(Sleepy Hollow) as Carmilla,Jessica Brown Findley(Downtown Abbey) as Leonore, Bill Nighy(Pirates of The Caribbean) as Saint Germain and Malcolm McDowell(A Clockwork Orange) as Varney/Death.",/review/rw6918511/?ref_=tt_urv

","First of all thank you Netflix, there really are no words witty enough to of describe what i fathomed here in this marvelous series,guys i recommend this anime.",/review/rw6918511/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2017,DarkVulcan29,9," I'm eagerly excited for the next season.
","I was not a fan of Castlevania, but I decided to give this a look and I'm glad I did, cause I'm now hooked on this entertaining series. It's a very adult animated series, for anyone who was a fan of the game. The character of Belmont, who is the hero with a who cares kind of attitude, just enjoyable chews up each scene he is in.",/review/rw6918511/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2017,rustywho,9," Amazing so far!!
",There is a lot happening in Castlevania and not much of a backstory has been provided in the first season which works as a positive for the show and one of the reasons that make this show quite intriguing. The characters may not feel fresh to some viewers but the storytelling has been an absolute treat in this season.,/review/rw6918511/?ref_=tt_urv

7 July 2017,laradavid,8," Loyal and beautiful
","Netflix made a good choice adapting this franchise. Castlevania has a fluid history line, with iconic characters and a beautiful art design. The soundtrack is not bad either, some Gothic and melodic songs, that make you chill with every encounter through the series. The only problem with Castlevania is the lack of explanation in some parts, and the size of the first season (only 4 episodes).",/review/rw6918511/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2021,ja_kitty_71,10," Another animated series definitely worth seeing
","As I had said, I had put off writing a review for so long; I just got sidetracked. But I got around to writing this review. Though I'm not very good at video games, I have watched on YouTube all of the ""walkthroughs"" of all the known ""Castlevania"" games. Now it has become one of my favourite video game franchises. I was really psyched to find out that there's going to be a ""Castlevania"" animated series on Netflix. So a week after the release, I had watched Season One, and I thought it was an awesome series!",/review/rw6918511/?ref_=tt_urv

7 July 2017,tidusx-25907,10," Ignore the few bad reviews.
","The Castlevania anime on Netlfix was fantastic. As a huge fan of the series, this was truly what it needed. I wanted it to be much longer though; at least 13 episodes or so. You can tell Konami took no part in the creation of this, because it actually had love for what the series was. On top of that, it follows my favorite Belmont, Trevor. While of course it had no ""Vania-esque"" music like the games, it did not need it. It felt in every way like a faithful Castlevania anime. Ignore the low ratings on here. Their opinions are utter garbage and are awful reasons for their scoring.",/review/rw6918511/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2018,crfields-48538,10," 1st season adds a fantastic setting, 2nd season adds heartwrenching emotion.
","This series is a gem. Everything about it seems like art. It's always emotionally complicated when a story has as sympathetic a villain as they do here with Dracula. I found myself literally rooting for both sides. I hope there is a 3rd season and if there is, I hope they find a way to keep the story as top notch as it has been.",/review/rw6918511/?ref_=tt_urv
