17 August 2003,liammurphy1,," IMAGINATIVE,GRIPPING WELL ACTED AND WELL WRITTEN!
","This has to be the best series made by the BBC for many years. The stories are well written, the acting by Alan Davies is great considering he's a comedian rather than a proper actor. The stories keep you on the edge of your seat and guessing till the very end.",/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2005,Metalfairy,10," Absolutely fantastic
","I was hooked on this programme when it first came out and now I have it on DVD, I can see just how fantastic this series is. Its a completely different take on the usual crime solving programme and the solutions to puzzles are absolutely amazing. I was constantly baffled and thought it was very clever the way Jonathan worked out some of the clues. Alan Davies and Caroline Quentin were absolutely fantastic in their parts, and I thought perfect for their roles. When Julia Sawahla replaced Caroline, I was dubious at first but she too was great in her role, despite not being the ultimate replacement for Caroline. I did not think any of the mysteries were at all daft, just very very clever and the chemistry between Alan and Caroline was fantastic.",/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2003,Sariandra,," Don't underestimate American audiences.
","For years now, I've heard my friends and relatives in the UK singing the praises of ""Jonathan Creek"". Unfortunately, I had never gotten the chance to experience the genius that is this show. But thanks to BBC-America, I can savor each and every mystery on Thursday afternoons (we get 2 episodes back-to-back!). I realize that, especially in the past 3 years, American television has consisted of a lot of very bad reality shows, and little else. Anything of substance is quickly taken off the air.. so that two more Real World/Survivor/Bachelor clones can take its place. There are millions of Americans who are starving for intelligent, thought-provoking entertainment. Of course Americans can handle ""Jonathan Creek"" -- why else would BBC-America continue to air it? This is an amazing show, and I truly wish our television big-wigs would realize that these kinds of shows work. Alan Davies is the ultimate anti-hero. Davies is gorgeous as the shy, rather nerdy, Jonathan. (I've developed a bit of a crush on him, to be honest :D) Maddy, played by the amazing Caroline Quentin, is the kind of role-model American women need: a tough-as-nails every-woman, who looks nothing like the malnourished actresses and models we see every day. The Americans who love this show are intelligent and witty, and we know good television when we see it.. and this is by far the best show I've had the pleasure of watching in a very long time.",/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2004,Svlad_Cjelli,," Disclaimer: I love this show
","Yes, I admit it, all my comments here are coloured by the fact that I loved this high quality, well written, funny, intelligent, crime-drama-comedy show since the pilot episode (The Wrestler's Tomb).",/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv

",Barring two or three sitcoms it is the best show ever made in the UK.,/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2004,silver17,10," My favourite TV show by a long way
","I think Jonathan Creek is a wonderful show. The mysteries are excellent, much better than boring police dramas, and the charaterisation is superb. Obviously some episodes are better than others, but they are always good.",/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2014,candidcamel,8," Loved this series with Carolyn Quentin, disliked all others
","I loved this series with Carolyn Quentin as Maddy. However, after she left, it simply wasn't as charming. Maddy provided comic relief and believability in her character as unique and ""real folkes"". I watched the entire series. I am American and we seldom see really Smart TV series. Unlike most UK Series that I watch repeatedly, (on my 5th viewing of New Tricks & Dalziel) for their character driven shows, JC sold out after Maddy was replaced with a different type of female lead. Maddy and Jonathan were quirky and unique. As the show progressed it became ""a sell-out"" to American type-casting, pretty blondes all in a row. The following UK Series illustrate the wonderful beauty of realistic, ""non-blonde stereotyping"" and/or ""pretty people"" characters that I love. You can't beat Warren Clarke as Andy Dalziel in Dalziel & Pascoe, truly rare and beautiful in my eyes. Alum Armstrong as Brian in New Tricks. New Tricks, an older mature character driven series gives us a real Blonde role model. (America has only come close in The Closer and Major Crimes). Blonde Amanda Redman as Sandra was not at all typical, she was a real tough, non apologetic, non whinning, non flirting, character. Endeavor, Morse, Lewis, Frost, George Gently and more...all of these intelligent series have flawed real people as characters as real people. Jonathan Creek lost that when Maddy left the show. Jonathan turned into an odd unrealistic sham of a character after that and the show suffered. I finished the series only in hope that Maddy would return and Jonathan would return to his original ""nerdiness"" Maddy made the series and required me to research her SWEET choices in life.",/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2013,blanche-2,10," I'm out of shows - I'm in complete withdrawal

12 July 2003,tpgodfrank,," Great, great entertainment.
","I never miss an episode of Jonathan Creek.  This is one show that captures your attention from start to finish.  It is brilliantly written, and equally brilliantly acted by both actors playing Jonathan and Maddie.  I hope that this mystery is around for a long, long time.  It would be a shame for it to end.  It is better than any show made in the U. S., and the only one that comes close to it as far as total entertainment is CSI.",/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,9," It's a terrific series.

27 August 2017,TheLittleSongbird,9," Very little ""creeks"" here

11 September 2010,Dr_Coulardeau,10," Why are only the English able to be that good?
","This series is in the English tradition of the « independent » investigator who helps the police solve some bad criminal cases essentially with their mind power and their observation power. The great model of them all is Sherlock Holmes but many more were invented and developed in detective story literature, especially female specimens like those of Agatha Christie. In this case the main mind, Jonathan Creek, is associated to a woman who is a reporter or writer of some kind. They are only interested in complex cases, especially having to do with some surreal or super-real elements. Jonathan Creek is by profession the technical inventor of a very successful magician, a certain Adam Klaus. So there is always the disappearing of a criminal or of some artifact, or some illusion that has to be placed back in context, and that cannot be explained at all with normal physical considerations. In other words magic. Then the stories always add a personal element about the victims and the people around the victims that is strange too and has to do with some kind of mysterious business often shown as a scam. The object here is to show that most ""magicians"" are nothing but crooks who pretend they are performing something supernatural, only when they are performing a sham, an illusion, a treacherous dishonest act. The stories are extremely inventive and the situation in which Jonathan Creek and his female associate finds themselves are often hairy and frightening. Generally it ends up in the hands of the police except from time to time when they decide it is worth a special treatment. The second Christmas special is typical at that level. Satan's Chimney really is Satan's Chimney. Of course not the Satan you may think of, but quite a different one that has not been living since the Middle Ages, but one of blood and flesh today. That Satan is so perverted that he leads some people into doing some so unnatural things that the name of Satan is by far miles away from his reality. The second quality of this series is that, being a BBC production, it has no advertising and an hour is an hour. I must say that is slightly different from the one hour American series that are reduced to a small 45 minutes, when so much, because of the advertising that is interspersed in the show. The extra fifteen minutes gives the story some depth because they just have the time to build that depth and there is only one enigma in each episode which makes it possible to concentrate on the details, and that once again is a major difference with American series in the field, today imitated by some European series, particularly French series. That's definitely a positive point. If you add to that the acting that is perfect, even at times more than perfect you nearly have a totally admirable picture. But in fact there is another essential element that is 100% British. It is humour (note the spelling of course). At times it is gross, at times it is subtle, or sexual, or political, or whatever but it is humour all right and it gives the series a catching look that you cannot miss. You laugh in the midst of the worst details of the worst crimes you can imagine. Finally we will note the police is practically always shown under a non-negative light, often positive, and some times not too swift. There is a nasty copper from time to time just to spice up the vision. This series is worth the numerous hours it covers at least 1,000%.",/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2021,jhmoondance,10," BRILLIANT!!!
",Well......I have just delved into this series n I forgot how brilliantly it is written n the stories are amazing n the plot is spotless. There is not as much tension n suspense as you would expect but the shear amazing way in which each episode unfolds is enough to keep you on your toes.,/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2020,Aziraphale615,8," First 3 seasons are great, then starts to slide downwards...
","Starting watching this after being gifted a Britbox subscription, and the first three seasons are excellent. Well-thought out problems/plots, interesting, 3 dimensional characters with an odd but palpable chemistry between the main 2, great acting, humor, etc. Season 4, not only is the chemistry between the 2 leads odd, but the mysteries are further out there. What I liked about the first 3 seasons is that you could actually figure out the mysteries - you might not know the why, but you could sometimes figure out the how. Fair mysteries, where the viewer really was given most of the pertinent information. This starts to ebb as we hit season 4. I just watched the first episode of season 5, and yeah, so far, it's the worst. I guess it just jumped the shark.",/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2001,akbrown,," A terrific series!
","One of the most appealing things about this series is the disarming charm of Alan Davies as Jonathan Creek. My husband and I discovered this show on BBC America a few weeks ago, and have been addicted ever since. The character of Jonathan Creek, in spite of his very unique job skills, is so shy and unassuming that he could easily be the quiet neighbor next door. There is no pretention about him, as seen in so many other classic detective-style protagonists. And Alan Davies, with his classical Dickensian-features delivers this remarkable character beautifully and credibly. He is a joy to watch, and endearing to the audience. Jonathan is also a wonderful straight-man for the flamboyant Maddie, played by Caroline Quentin. Maddie is fun, resourceful, and all that much more enjoyable because she's not some twiggy fashion plate. Like Jonathan, Maddie is a very credible character with very human frailties and aspirations. The romantic tension between them is marvellously well paced as they work together, solve mysteries and otherwise drive each other to distraction. The  characters are well developed and far more than 2 dimensional detectives, and the plots are nearly impossible to second-guess.",/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2003,christy-39,," Excellent Series
","I agree whole-heartedly with our other reviewer.  This is an excellent series, and the chemistry between the lead characters is subtle and tangible.  As of this writing, the series is currently airing on BBCA, and I would encourage viewers to check it out.",/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2005,A Jay,," A brilliant detective series
","I have to say that I really enjoy this series, but I did prefer Caroline Quentin to Julia Sawalha. Quentin could just deliver a better comedy performance and was less stilted. Not to criticise Sawalha's performance though, she was still a brilliant sidekick for Jonathan.",/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2014,gjcannon,3," Plot hole and general grump
","Near the start of the episode, the couple visit friends of Polly who Jonathan will be meeting for the first time. Their house seems empty and Polly goes to look for them 'in the studio' while Jonathan hears a noise upstairs and finds a couple tied and gagged. He releases them and Polly runs into a couple by the studio. But they, not the tied-up couple, are the householders who had discovered and overpowered the 'Jonathan couple' and had tied them up while awaiting the police.",/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2020,epc-12,5," What the heck happened???
","Loved all 4 seasons of Jonathon Creek with his quirky female ""helpmates""- some more than others. Upon finishing season 4 with THE GRINNING MAN, and THE JUDAS TREE we zipped into Season 5!!!!
What the heck? Jonathan is MARRIED, has smoother gray hair and is married to some sort corporate wealthy woman.
Hey, Jonathan Creek writers? Did you ever hear of ""continuity""? How the heck this all happen? What happened to Jonathan to get to this point? How did he meet this woman to whom he finally gave his heart? Sure are wondering!
This is a huge (once great series) disappointment which we are not continuing after all this time.
You have made a huge blunder by taking a slip- shod way out in absolving yourselves from the creative process in continuing that which was once a charming and also gripping mystery series.
You have made a mega mistake and sold yourselves and your faithful audience down the river in a leaky boat.",/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv

22 August 2009,pekinman,7," Excellent to start with, then...
",The first episode I saw of 'Jonathan Creek' was called 'The House of Monkeys' with Annette Crosbie guest-starring. I remembered that show and watched it several times as I had taped it. It was the only episode I managed to catch but I always wanted to gather the entire series in so I could watch them. I recognized it as being far above the standard fare even for British TV let alone the wretched U.S. television product.,/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv

23 October 2011,clotblaster,10," Highly Entertaining with Almost Uniformly Excellent Stories
","This show is simply superb and Jonathan Creek, the character and the show, is a very special creation. In spite of the grating quality of all the female sidekicks who accompany him--actually I have figured out that the female sidekicks are intentionally made to be ""fingernails on the chalkboard"" scratchy and off-putting, but it took me awhile to buy into the creator's intention to have Creek's laid back character contrast with the magician and also contrast/conflict with the females. Someone praised Julia Swahala effusively, but she is just serviceable and appropriately obnoxious--nothing special. To actually see her in a good role, you might view some episodes of Lark Rise to Candleford, in which she acts the character wonderfully. I found most of the shows to be entertaining and Alan Davies as the lead is great. Most non-recurring actors are also good in their roles. All in all, this is a very watchable show. Highly recommended.",/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2018,zsinka,8," Crime solving with some magic
","Hooked up on the series quickly, very funny and love how they are thinking through the impossible crimes. However after Quentin left it's not as funny anymore.. She made Creek interesting. Otherwise I would have given a 10.",/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2019,dnlmonaco,7," A fantastic show ruined by some of the most miserable characters in the history of TV
","The ""Magician detective"" is an idea that's been done to death but never done quite as well as when it was done by this show. This is mostly due to the main character's shyness and retiring nature, played to a ""T"" by Alan Davis. He would be perfectly happy just sitting at home planning tricks for his self absorbed boss but instead keeps getting dragged all over England to confront the British Isle's criminal population, all of whom are unbelievably well versed in stage magic techniques that are elaborately applied to rather unbelievable crimes. The writing is good enough to keep your disbelief dangling on a tight rope.",/review/rw4811526/?ref_=tt_urv
