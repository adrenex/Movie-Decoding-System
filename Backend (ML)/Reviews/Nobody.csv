26 May 2021,cjonesas,8," [8.2] The charismatic conquistador
","A nice piece of Australian entertainment with fine acting, engaging storylines, bright visual effects and smooth, entertaining flow.",/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2018,tpsn,9," Suspenseful, quirky and Brisbane as you've never seen it before!
",The first episode of Harrow was a fun watch in my opinion. I like how there seems to be a crime-of-the-day element with the overarching plot lines. Looking forward to seeing what comes next! Not sure what the negative reviews on here are about. There's cliches and common ground in most crime dramas. I think some can't see past their own biases and assess this on its own merit. I'd avoid trying to compare the show to anything else and simply watch with an open mind!,/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2018,oliviamteller,9," More please.
","While I can't speak to the authenticity of Australian location portrayal, as other reviewers have, I think the show was great.
Acting, camera work, jokes, and banter between coworkers, all served to create a believable environment.
And that dark past of his, just waiting to be revealed and possibly destroy everything, hovers in the background, creating tension.
I find myself waiting for the next episode.
One reviewer complains about there being a personal story behind the main character, but that's how we end up finding out about that mysterious past of his.
And, seriously, what do they want? A cardboard cutout character with minimal lines and no home life? The added drama keeps the show interesting, adds extra levels to the character as it goes, and family members are always potentially at risk when there's a hero character involved, so there's that.
Give the show a chance and don't pay attention to bad reviews if you already think you might like something.",/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2018,amina2306,10," Cant wait for season 2
","Just finished watching Season 1. What an awesome show. Keeps you totally interested. Not a boring moment. Loved the show, Love the main character. Cause he is not squeaky clean! He has his shades of grey!! Keep it coming!!!",/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2018,kme-194-438558,8," Excellent! A slow burn just a good show should be.
",If it doesn't get you in straight away then persist a little. The characters develop nicely as the writers find their stride and the stories gain momentum. Definitely worth a watch.,/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2021,tlmartin61,10," Just like Forever...
",I really like Harrow. Was so upset when they canceled Forever so this helps make up for it. But I still prefer Forever cuz I love the immortality and Judd Hursh's role.,/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2018,pontram,," It doesn't want to be Dexter
","I only watched this show in the first place, because of Ioan Gruffudd, since I liked him very much in ""Forever"", and since I missed him after the show's unjust cancellation.
""Harrow"" is a Procedural, and as one of these it is pretty formulaic, like ""Bones"" over its many seasons. But it has also some interesting sidelines, like a partially disturbed daughter, who plays the homeless drifter out of rebellion, or because of other reasons that have to be revealed (I am through ep. 07), and a big mystery that involves a body, sunk by Harrow himself, that lands on his own table for forensic examination.",/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2019,kevin-mac-1,6," Stretching believability
",I thoroughly enjoyed season one and was eagerly awaiting season two. Viewing season two was rewarding until it came to the last two episodes. Here the credibility of the storyline was seriously stretched. From far too many coincidences that were either not picked up upon or ignored.,/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2020,mnjonman,5," A tale of two seasons
","Season one was a ten. Everything worked. An all around great show. Season two, however, I shut down half way through the first episode, as I do every show I watch that insults my everyday common sense.",/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2020,Web_Of_Doom,5," Daniel Harrow is a total idiot ""genius""
","I have watched both season 1 & 2. The show should have ended then as Season 1 was a 7 out of 10, however season 2 dropped down to a 3 out of 10 in my honest opinion. The idea that the main character is supposed to be this ""genius"" & amazing pathologist is a good ( if not original ) concept, however over & over again the main character keeps doing some incredibly stupid things only a total idiot would do.
This ruins the show as season one could have been so much better if Harrow was always acting highly intelligent ( like a Sherlock Holmes, Columbo or a Quincy ).
As all great characters have their believable flaws like the 3 legendary ones I just gave above as examples, unfortunately Harrows flaws simply are unbelievable as no ordinary person could make so many ridiculous stupid mistakes he makes.
The dichotomy between his ""genius"" & ""idiocy"" is too big a bridge to accept.",/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2020,zterrell,3," blew it
","Like many of those who enjoyed 'Forever', we wanted to like this show. But the hidden story turned out to be a case of self-defense that any sane man would have turned over to the police and been cleared. The second season went from bad to worse as Harrow is too dumb to get the police involved and they kill off the one, single likable character on the series. That was enough for us. How do you make a man so observant and intelligent and yet have him be a complete dummy? The writers should go back to soap operas and Harrow should get a job parking cars.",/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2021,sheepshearer,5," Season 2 is almost unwatchable.
","I liked season 1, enough to keep me watching anyways, but towards the end of season 2 I had to stop.",/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2018,lakotaluv,10," I am so happy to see that it has been renewed for season 2!
",Loan is absolutely amazing in this new show and I have fallen in love with Remy and Ella as well. I was hooked on the United States series Forever and crushed when it was cancelled. Harrow is a dream come true for me!,/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2019,Pursewarden,1," Down a unrecognizable slope
","First season was well executed and interesting until the bit overextended ending. But season 2 is so irritating it's difficult to bear. Overacted, stretching believability to extremes beyond any forgivable point. Characters out of character, plot driven irrational behavior. It all works to ruin any good thing it had for the sake of cheap thrills.",/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2021,sdetlef,4," Contrived infuriating writing!
",You will end up HATING the supporting characters because the writing is so impossibly contrived. The supporting characters are evil caricature villains that are dead set on ruining the main character and ignoring all common sense and reason. They can not possibly be that bad at their jobs. They have to be intentionally working against the main character....,/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2018,marcominici,10," Absolutely great!
","It's very well done! Interesting and catchy! Brisbane looks beautiful and it's pretty cool to see so many known places. 
Someone compare it to Dexter but had nothing to do with it. And someone rated after they watched just 10 minutes. I can honestly say that it's totally worth to watch till the end! 
Great TV show!!!",/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2020,nancy-793-228879,8," Bing watched in a few days
",Fast pace and well thought out. Clever writing. Love Ioan but his acting style des leave a lot to be desired! he does over egg the puddingðŸ˜‚,/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2021,Left_back,6," Less Harrow, more intelligence
","What is it about smart people making terrible choices? The first season was a smash, bang introducing us to a pathologist with secrets, relationship issues and death of the week. Great chemistry between principals and a nice wrap up at season's end. The through story was riveting and a shocker, Harrow actively muddying an investigation into the death of his ex-wife's partner for... reasons.",/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2021,yooniverse,8," Great show! Binge-worthy
","With the premature end to the US show, Forever, Ioan Gruffudd finds himself another forensic pathologist/coroner role. And he's really quite good at it!",/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2021,laragi,7," Rather liked it
","I hope there is a season 4. Fun characters, entertaining, fast paced, bloody good!",/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2021,npvarley,10," What a great show!
","Well, I've just watched the season 3 finale and it wraps up another great season. This show is just so entertaining. It's well-written, well acted, well shot and the soundtrack is excellent.",/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2018,george_cuarenton,9," Question
","Do you know if there will be a second season?
In my opinion, it is very good, even though we could already guess the reason for the homicide, the development of the plot is very interesting ...",/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2018,kris-gray,9," I'm praying for a second series
","I like most things Ioan Gruffund is in ( excepting the awful Feminist 'Liar' ) and I really enjoyed this. OK it is obvious who killed his ex wife's husband but the twist in the last episode was welcome, we didn't really want him to get arrested for it.",/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2020,Jima-36-585491,5," What a mess
","Harrow suffers from bad writing, overacting, too much filler. A three, or maybe four, hour story is extended to ten hours. Supporting characters are inconsistent in their responses to the main character depending on the immediate requirements of the scene.",/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2021,randymcbeast,2," Steadily declined in quality
","I've watched through s03e09 and I'm finally writing a review because I'm just amazed at how bad this has gotten. First, I want to say that the reason I made it this far was because of Ioan Gruffudd. He's a brilliant actor and this is a great role for him (although, he has done this before in Forever so a mild ripoff). Darren Gilshenan cracks me up too so no complaints there. The rest of the cast is dreadful and very hard to watch. Jolene Anderson is on the top of the awful list. A mannequin could do a better job.",/review/rw6780012/?ref_=tt_urv
