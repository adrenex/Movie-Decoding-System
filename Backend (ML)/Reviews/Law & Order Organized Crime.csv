16 January 2022,CaptRon-2,3," Poor writing and unbelievable plots
","It started with a good premise even if there weird theme music was jarring. However, by late in the second season, it just became unwatchable. The dialog is terrible and the storylines are simply laughable. I like Dylan as an actor but the role they wrote for him makes him look like a cartoon villain from a Bond movie. The guy is a major mobster who has killed dozens of people along with 100 different other crimes but suddenly he is the nation's cyber expert working for the FBI?...and the world's leading crypto currency expert as well????",/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,Fiercesome_Fool,4," Comic Book Writing
",Law & Order shows used to have a grounded feel to them. That however has long been thrown out and this show is comic book level of ridiculous. The Wheatley character is a straight up comic villain with his eccentric personality and the BS he gets away with. The relationship with his family is laughably absurd. Season 2 episode 10 this show has gone completely off the rails with the nonsense hacking and having Wheatley getting direct access to the governor of New York. This show is made for the people who love Marvel movies.,/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,birdgirl-49240,3," Wrap up the Wheatley story already.
","This has turned in to a never ending soap opera with miserable, unlikable characters that have overstayed their welcome. Get some fresh stories and characters and get back to the tried and true L&O formula that has worked well for decades.",/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2021,Racingphan2,4," What a tragic mess.
",Christopher Meloni is still amazing as Stabler. But the rest of this show is unwatchable.,/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2021,Avidviewer-02847,2," Fire the writers room, this is another formulaic drama that we've seen before..
","Another formulaic cop drama, where the lead is out to avenge the death of a family member or a friend. And they insist on being part of the investigation even though no one in their right mind would allow it, except writers of TV drama.",/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2021,maddison-59657,9," Thank you Christopher Meloni
",I just wanted to say a big Thank You to Christopher Meloni for coming back to Law and Order. You are such a great actor and I think that it is AWESOME that your role as Detective Stabler has been revived. You were made to play this role. I look forward to seeing this spin off series doing really well and continuing for many years to come. Well done Sir.,/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2021,hackraytex,8," It Has A Lot Going For It
","I can see that my opinion of this program is different from previous ones. I respect their opinions. I have to say that I am a fan of Christoper Meloni and the Elliot Stabler character. I lost interest in SVU when he left and that is not to deminish the others of SVU. Sometimes when a long time key player leaves a show the dynamics of the show and the chemistry of the cast is thrown off balance and it takes a while to recover. I think the cast of L&O: OC is a good group and I am also a fan of Dylan McDermott although he is the villian in this program. As it is said, a good villain is what makes a show work. It is good to see Stabler back and I hope the network gives the show time to hit its stride.",/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2021,lindo-julet,9," Get Stabler a better team!!
","Love, love, love. Die hard L&O will probably not like the newer approach (new in a sense that it differs from L&O). But I love how this built on the current police show aesthetics and it's finding its own style. Being inclusive will always get a few folks mad, but THIS is a great direction. I hope the continue to be bold and give Stabler a solid team. Lol.",/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2021,marymcfarland-01866,2," It's Official This is NOT for Me
","Trying to give ep2 a chance after really not liking ep1 and...I can't even. It plays like some student film Godfather parody. Yall enjoy. I'm out. It's too bad. I was hoping for so much more. Frankly, I was looking for something to replace SVU which has been on the fast track to nowhere for years now. I really wanted to love this. Oh well.",/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2021,Colin_Sibthorpe_II,4," A horrible disappointment
","The first episode of any new show will be below par because they have to set the scene, introduce the characters etc. Even making allowances for this Episode 1 here was really terrible. I mean, Stabler is broken up by the murder of his wife - as he would be. But...we get it! We don't need to be reminded every five minutes. Episode 2 wasn't much better.",/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2021,tlharrison-59546,10," I had to watch it because I just had to
","Like many others, I was skeptical. You can't go home again, it's true. The first few episodes weren't for me but I stayed with it and just having finished the 7th episode, all I can say is DAMN, this show is good. It isn't SVU. It isn't early-aughts family-man Stabler. Some people are complaining about the topics covered in this show, but all L&O shows have always dealt with current issues going on in the country and the issues in this show are unfortunately a part of what's going on in the country. Give this show a fair shake if you're gonna watch it. I see many reviews from April of people bashing it, and I almost would have agreed back then but each week it gets better!",/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2021,IceQueen99,5," UPDATE: I'm out. Way too nuts.
",Stabler is nuts. I can't watch this anymore. This character's lifestyle cannot be maintained and can't end well. Do I want to watch this violent self destruction? No. I don't.,/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2021,bkkaz,8," Stabler is Back and so is the Competence in the Law and Order Franchise
","The return of Christopher Meloni makes everyone step up their game -- the writing, the directing, and even the acting. With Meloni, probably the most talented of the SVU acting ensemble, to bounce off of, Mariska Hargitay improves several notches over her version of Benson the past few seasons. The result is a crossover that works much better than anything SVU has attempted in years.",/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2021,sanjsrik,2," Who are the sheeple giving this a good review?
","He needs to go and do a few more seasons of Happy. The fact that this is just literally more of the same actors genuflecting in hammed up poses in unrealistic stories meant for, who? It's just painful to watch. The diatribe that comes out as dialogue, the twisted plots that are not even well-written. They don't even bother to say any more that this is based on reality. This is based on someone needing a new summer house in Malibu.",/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2021,WhatcanyaDo,8," Give It a Few Episodes...Then It Becomes Great
","I'm the first to admit, the first two episodes were kinda dry. Despite the slow start, we hung in and continued to watch until it became the most anticipated tv show of our tv watching week. The cast does a really good job; you'll love to hate the bad guys and cheer for the good guys. That's just how a cop show should be. This show isn't like your typical episodic L&O series, but give it chance and it will soon grab your attention.",/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2022,bosporan,4," Law & Order fatigue
","Another derivative lazily written show. Watched a good chunk of season one, we have seen all the plots before. Branding it L&O to pull suckers like me in will not keep us there without some substance and is diluting. This has nothing, it is dull minimum-to-get-by TV and less interesting than watching paint dry.",/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2021,gggpybrzh,9," It's NOT Supposed to be SVU
","I think once viewers understand that this is not supposed to be a branch of SVU they could give it an opportunity on its own. People are comparing it to its franchise when in fact it's really its own show. It doesn't wrap up with a bow every episode bike SVU does. The storylines are longer and for me that's a nice change because I never thought it was realistic for the cases in SVU to be solved within an episode or two. If you're interested in 21st-century mob crimes that are of this time, I don't think that you will have an issue with show one bit. The only reason why I'm not giving it a full 10 is because I'm not sure if it's a budget issue, but props just don't look good on the show. You'll see an iPhone that doesn't have an iPhone interface. You'll see I'll prop for an octopus that isn't CGI so it's inflated and looks really cheap. I think that could possibly get better with a larger budget With more viewership or if they already have the budget from the other series then they need to up their prop game. Watch this without the expectation that it is SVU and just a brand new show and I think you'll have the same outlook as I did.",/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2021,toncincin,4," Weird storyline
",Stolen Covid vaccines? Stolen vaccines being given to people free? I don't know about anyone else - but EVERYONE I know has gotten their vaccine free. All we've had to do is register and wait in line. Nit understanding the storyline...perhaps it was written before the vaccines became available?,/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2021,mv171661,3," Nope
",I guess I should have watched the SVU lead in but I still didn't like this new show. First off every new show this season feels compelled to address racism and gender issues. I feel like I am being preached to. But even without that I just was bored. I will watch again but I am not hopeful.,/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2021,mysterymoviegoer,2," what a disappointment!
",What is going on here? It's hard to believe this is a Law and Order product. Deadly dull writing. Cliche-ed plot developments. Uninteresting acting. Chris Meloni seems trapped in a show that is going nowhere. Mariska Hargitay wanders in and out of episodes like she's lost. Is this deliberate? We are miles away from Jerry Orbach or Steven Hill or Epatha Merkerson and L & O at its peak. I tuned out halfway through episode 2. Yawn.,/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2021,throwaway50000,3," I hated it
","I hated the way it was shot. I don't know the technical theatrical term for it, but I hated it and had to turn it off.",/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2021,mls4182,1," Unwatchable
",The writing and supporting actors are just bad. I miss the original Law and Order. It every actor on that show was superb and the diversity natural. This show is just forced and almost laughable. Do it right or don't bother.,/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2021,denis-38,," Better to have stayed away...
","Badly written, woodenly performed, and even for this liberal, gay, viewer, WAY too ""woke."" (I counted at least two potential transgender characters.) And why, if Stabler was away doing good work, being his own boss, is he back in New York as a ""member of the team"" overseen by--sigh!--an aggressive, unsympathetic woman of color? It doesn't appear this will become a series with stand-alone episodes, rather a long journey to fond out Who Killed Kathy? (Given the issues in the Stabler marriage it would made more sense to return him as divorced from Kathy and estranged from his kids--especially the now totally unrecognizable Dickie Stabler--what the heck happened there?!!) It is a mystery to me how ""SVU"" has continued--I find it unbearable and totally unrealistic now. I don't see ""Organized Crime"" lasting more than a short season.",/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2021,Clarence-Worley-86,1," The show is terrible
","As soon as i seen Dylan i knew this would be bad .. but i was wrong it is worse than bad. They destroyed every character, the show became like NCIS so fake and nothing like the old law and order episodes. They focus on BLm which i think is disgusting every television show has to let us know they back these low lives and when law and order degrades themselves it makes me sick. Anyway back to the script of this atrocious tv show .. i would say skip it watch the old ones and forget this exists.",/review/rw6868462/?ref_=tt_urv
