3 November 2022,tkdlifemagazine,7," Aubrey Plaza and Theo Rossi are Terrific Together
","Aubrey Plaza and Theo Rossi are Terrific Together in this drama and thriller rolled into one. Plaza shows great acting acumen as a ""down on her luck"" artist who becomes swept up in a crime spree to earn extra income. She is sweet, vulnerable, and relatable in this roll. She plays it really well. Rossi is terrific as her crime mentor. He plays a savvy non-violent criminal with a softer side. The film reminds me of another great film, Uncut Gems, in all the right ways. The acting is sharp. The Direction is first class. The Cinematography is very good. The movie is small in some senses. But it evokes many emotions- from anxiety to sadness, and more. This so worth watching for the performances alone.",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv

","Holy moly what a surprising gem... with soooooo many terrible movies coming out and finding a decent, let alone, a good movie is like finding a needle in a haystack.",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,jdesando,," An anti-hero for our times and a superior actress.
","Emily the Criminal stands next to Maverick for the best thriller of the year. That's because of Aubrey Plaza, who plays the anti-hero for our times",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2022,Minnesota_Reid,9," The Making of a Criminal
","This is a very engaging movie. Plaza is good, and Rossi, as her mentor in crime, is even better. They have a good chemistry together, which makes all the difference.",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,UniqueParticle,9," Definitely best performance of Aubrey Plaza!
","I wanted to see in theater but it only lasted a week at the theater I go to and was sick at the time glad it's on Netflix now. Emily the Criminal is intense, spectacular, and thrilling; very much worthy of praise! Hard to put 600 characters in about this movie some don't need it but I'll try. Anyway the acting/directing is magnificent throughout especially since it was written and directed by John Patton Ford a not known by himself that's always impressive to me. A great example of someone willing to do a lot for money even if it's risky, law breaking or life threatening. This movie stays enjoyable and perfectly suspenseful for some of it.",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2022,jmccrmck-65172,8," what other movies try to be . . . and . . . fail at dismally.
","Gripping , poignant , acting as good as it gets and a story that keeps you wanting to see more. I keep this review brief because if you don't see this move you will be the one missing out. Best thing I have watched at home or in the movie theater for some time.",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,BijeshNagesh,8," Astonishingly Relevant & Realistic
","A debt-ridden woman with an unkind past forced, Emily was cornered into partaking of a shady 'dummy shopper' scam. Things got bad to worse from there, resulting in a movie that was equally entertaining and gripping.",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2022,ferguson-6,7," Plaza breaking bad
","Greetings again from the darkness. Aubrey Plaza proved during ""Parks and Recreation"", and most every role since, that she is nearly unmatched in her ability to deliver blistering one-liners. However, over the last few years, she has expanded her repertoire and has become a fascinating, multi-talented actress who is exciting to watch. The feature film debut of writer-director John Patton Ford provides the opportunity for Ms. Plaza to push her dramatic chops into the world of crime. She not only doesn't disappoint, she excels.",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,lee_eisenberg,9," quite a few people in this day and age have no other choice
","We sometimes hear about how financial desperation drives people to extreme actions. The gritty ""Emily the Criminal"" depicts such a thing. Aubrey Plaza plays a debt-ridden cook who sees no other option but to start working in the black market.",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,bostonct,8," Pretty Solid performance.
","I think the reviews give you the overall gist of what this movie is all about but what's very striking, and entertaining is when Emily goes a little psycho. Not a ranting or dramatic psycho but a very focused, calculating one. Very solid performance, and the co-lead is a very good complement. If you liked Atomic Blonde, Anna, Salt and any other strong female lead that refuses to let the world get the better of them, you'll like this one.",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2022,GypsyJJJ,9," This surprised me.
","Decent movies are becoming rarer nowadays. They're produced like junk food. On an industrial scale and with very little intrinsic value, soul or art. This little gem is definitely not one of those and I'd comfortably place in the fantastic category. Aubrey is outstanding! She's still the same actor you'll recognise instantly but also manages to pull off something completely fresh and unexpected. The story is a cracker. Excellently shot. Pacing is on point. Cast is spot on.",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,tilokaudaman,9," Compelling and beautifully acted
",This is a terrific movie with excellent performances and outstanding character development. Emily's decent into a life of crime is believable. It is also a commentary on the difficulty for people living on the edge with problems involving their background checks and being deeply debt in places like Los Angeles where this story takes place.,/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2022,deloudelouvain,8," Credit card scams, the crime that nobody seems to care about in the USA.
","Well I enjoyed this movie. It was much better than I thought it would be. Credit card fraud is so common in the USA nobody seems to care. As an European I don't get why almost nobody gets punished for this. My wife is American and I had already three times the unpleasant surprise witnessing identity theft and credit card scams, all cases that could have been very easily solved, but apparently nobody cares and so it goes on and on. I guess putting drug addicts in jail is a bigger priority for them. I wasn't expecting for Aubrey Plaza to play this kind of character. She mostly plays in comedies, with the excellent series Parks and Recreation as a reference. This time a more serious role for her and she was very convincing in playing her character of a woman with a pair of balls. Theo Rossi, mostly known as Juice in Sons of Anarchy also did a good job playing his character. The story itself is easy to follow, pleasant and entertaining. No real dull moments, and it has a good flow to it. Emily the Criminal is certainly worth a watch.",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2022,Reviews_of_the_Dead,9," Interesting Commentary on Relevant Issues with Anxiety Driving Pace
","This is a movie that intrigued Jaime when she saw the trailer at the Gateway Film Center. It wouldn't be one that I would normally go to see there unless I was free and determined to go. Since she was so excited, we went to see this. It made it easy as I'm an of Aubrey Plaza and this had an interesting premise.",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2022,FeastMode,5," Aubrey is awesome
","I'm having difficulty rating this movie. On one hand, it's a mostly well-made movie with a good performance by Plaza (who I've always liked, especially in Legion and Parks). I was never bored and there isn't anything I disliked.",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,rabbitmoon,10," Sometimes you just wanna see a great thriller...
","Sometimes you sit down and just want to see a tight thriller. Genuine suspense. The kind of thing you would rent from a videostore in the 90s (Basic Instinct, Dead Calm, Silence of the Lambs, Cape Fear etc). Sadly, that experience is VERY hard to come by - you need to basically rewatch old films you already know, or risk wasting time on an absolute dud with shoddy performances and script, CGI explosions etc.",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,kaefab,8," Aubrey is one hell of an actress
","Aubrey Plaza is one hell of an actress. I saw her in drama, i saw her in comedy i saw her in horror movies and she rocks every role she gets.",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,nickpedersen,9," Good movie
",Aubrey is really doing a good job in this movie. She is a funny actress that always allow to show a little of her twisted personality in her movies.,/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2022,lavatch,8," The Psychology of Criminal Behavior
","It is possible that the producers of ""Emily the Criminal"" were thinking of untold numbers of victims of the recession when making their film. The protagonist Emily is deep in debt, possesses a criminal record, and is desperate to find a way out of her hopeless financial predicament.",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv

19 September 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," Anyone know where I can get paid $200 to buy a TV? Asking for a friend.
","There are two major impressive feats in this film; the outstanding performance by the ""iconic resting b-face"" Aubry Plaza, and the excellent writing and directing by literally newb filmmaker John Patton Ford, who has only one prior short film on his resume.",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2022,rdoyle29,8," A portrait of a psychopath disguised as a commentary on the economy
","Aubrey Plaza finds herself permanently underemployed. She has the beginning of a design degree, but had to leave due to a felony aggravated assault charge and finds herself with no job prospects and a mountain of debt. She works part time for a food delivery service. Every attempt to find a better job collides with her criminal record.",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2022,masonfisk,7," PLAZA IS PLEASING...!
","Audrey Plaza stars in this recent release. Plaza works a menial job trying to make ends meet (she has art school debt) as a caterer but one day after covering a co-worker's spot (he needs to take his kid to a school event) she gets repaid w/a chance to make a quick buck w/a shady outfit giving their minions duped credit cards to purchase big ticket items (big screen TV's) for resale. Getting increasingly frustrated w/her day job & the promises from her airy, irresponsible friend, Megalyn Echikunwoke, to get her a position in her ad firm, she decides to go whole hog on the illicit activities (prompted by her mentor & soon to be lover, Theo Rossi) but when Rossi gets robbed of his funds by his partner (as a rebuke for Plaza getting caught on security video), Rossi & Plaza devise a plan to get the funds back. Plaza has been getting much press for her dramatic turn & the film does deliver in some areas w/some lapses in story construction (something someone like Michael Mann may've ironed over) but Plaza is always watchable. Also starring Gina Gershon as Echikunwoke's boss & John Billingsley (the doctor from Enterprise) as a job interviewer.",/review/rw8543384/?ref_=tt_urv
