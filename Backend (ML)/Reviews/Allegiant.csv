7 October 2013,CinemaClown,," A Bug's Life is A Little Insight Into How People At Pixar Work, Imagine, Create & Entertain Us.
","After dazzling everyone with its unforgettable debut that revolutionised the entire animation industry in the long run, Pixar Animation Studios' follow up to their highly revered Toy Story is another wonderful piece of imagination, innovation & animation that once again presents a unique take on life but this time from a bug's point of view.",/review/rw0447208/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 1999,Peach-2,8," Wow.
","There is great detail in A Bug's Life. Everything is covered. The film looks great and the animation is sometimes jaw-dropping. The film isn't too terribly orignal, it's basically a modern take on Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, only with bugs. I enjoyed the character interaction however and the bad guys in this film actually seemed bad. It seems that Disney usually makes their bad guys carbon copy cut-outs. The grasshoppers are menacing and Hopper, the lead bad guy, was a brillant creation. Check this one out.",/review/rw0447208/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2020,aidanratesmovies,8," Not perfect, but quite enjoyable
","Although consistently entertaining, A Bug's Life fails to deliver on all accounts, by feeling more formulaic overall than its own interesting concepts sprinkled throughout. The film can be very humorous at times, but can also vary on the border of being overly-goofy and in result, some jokes do fall quite flat. The animation, although not as great as its work shortly before, is quite good and full of vibrant color, which makes it very easy on the eyes. The music in the film is really good, with Randy Newman providing a stellar soundtrack, as he always does. The voice work is fairly impressive, with the circus bugs taking the lead in terms of voice work and in character development. The circus bugs are often the best part of the film, and their humor seems rather genuine and their story very engaging, unlike some tropes used earlier with the ants themselves. However, the ant Dot in the film can prove to be quite an adorable change of pace throughout, and stole the show in every scene she was in. In the end, A Bug's Life is far from Pixar's greatest work, but is a mildly enjoyable time. It has a wonderful cast of supporting characters, and is full of vibrant colors, and a score that is very easy to listen to.
My Rating: 8.75/10",/review/rw0447208/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," Bug's Life is really funny!
","Critically, people say that Antz is better. Antz is a good film, but I enjoyed Bug's Life a bit more. I can't remember a Pixar animation, other than the two Toy Story films, that I was laughing so hard. The animation is clean, the story is original and doesn't preach. The voice overs are what make this movie. Dave Foley is an earnest ant that gets himself into trouble a lot. Hopper is a superb characterisation by the always wonderful Kevin Spacey, as is Haydn Panettiere as Dot . There is also sterling support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I could go on and on. The script is fantastic, so funny and sometimes even touching. It lacks the social messages of Antz, but what we have is rock-solid entertainment. 9/10. Bethany Cox",/review/rw0447208/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2012,Tweekums,8," A fun insect adventure from Pixar
","Every summer the ants must harvest grain for the coming winter; not just for themselves but for the bullying grasshoppers who demand half the harvest. One of the ants, an inventor named Flik, tries to find ways to make the harvest easier but the other ants aren't impressed; they prefer the old ways. When the grasshoppers come all the ants flee onto their anthill but as Flik adds his contribution to the pile he knocks it over and it is all lost. Hopper, the leader of the grasshoppers tells the ants that they must provide twice the normal amount of grain before the end of summer or they will take all the ants food and let them starve. Flik offers to go into town to get some warrior insects to fight off the grasshoppers when they return; his offer is accepted... not because he is expected to succeed but because it will get him out of the way. The only ant that has any faith in Flik is Princess Dot, but she is just a child. In town Flik meets a group of unsuccessful circus insects and mistakes them for warriors. He returns home a hero, but when is becomes apparent that they aren't warriors the colony appears to be doomed.",/review/rw0447208/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2002,soranno,," An amusing animated fantasy for all ages
","Several of Walt Disney Pictures' best animated films of recent years have been released or distributed through Pixar, an animation studio that specializes in computer generated animation and ""A Bug's Life"", their follow up to the hugely successful ""Toy Story"" ranks as one of the best and funniest Walt Disney Pictures animated films. Released during the same month as a similar computer generated animated film, ""Antz"", ""A Bug's Life"" suffers no bad comparisons because I consider it to be just as good as amusing as ""Antz."" The main focus of the film is Flik, a worker ant who has a very inventive mind and keen eye for detail. He means well but his attempts at helping his fellow ant colony with his ideas and inventions usually cause accidental disaster. One day, the ant colony set up a tribute display for a bad grasshopper named Hopper and his gang but Flik accidentally knocks it down. Hopper is very upset by this and he threatens to kill off the entire colony if they don't build him another provisions pile by the time he inspects the area again. Flik decides to help. He has only a few days to find some ""warrior"" bugs that can stand up to Hopper and his gang. He comes across a group of disgruntled bugs that had just been fired from their gigs at a flea circus. Flik decides to bring them back to the colony and recruit them as warrior bugs. An inventive idea for a children's film with much of the same humor and ideas that helped to make ""Toy Story"" an animated classic.",/review/rw0447208/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2015,taylorkingston,7," An adorable kids movie...
","I really like this movie. It's cute, adorable, sweet and fun-loving with lots of comedy aimed at young viewers. Don't get me wrong, this movie can be enjoyed by adults, such as me. I was a child when I first saw this movie and now as an adult, I still really enjoy it.",/review/rw0447208/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2009,Chrysanthepop,," One of the Most Endearing Bug Stories
","The strongest point of every Pixar movie I've seen is that they all have heart. While the excellent colourful animation has been consistent in quality, it's the soulful stories and memorable characters that we love and return to with each viewing. 'A Bug's Life' has always been on my to-watch list and I finally bought the DVD yesterday. It's already become a favourite after first viewing. The animation is beautifully detailed and the motion is brilliant. Not only are the characters wonderfully illustrated but also the background is given plenty of detail. Moreover these characters are so adorable as they are superbly brought to life that you'll fall in love with them. The voice cast that includes talents like Bonnie Hunt, Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Dave Foley and Richard Kind do a great job. Clearly, Pixar does not depend on stars (unlike Dreamworks) and they rather focus on the material by creating it with heart. 'A Bug's Life' is another winner from Pixar that I'll very likely be revisiting again and again.",/review/rw0447208/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2008,g-bodyl,10," Very Good Piece of Animation!
","A Bug's Life is a very good animated feature. This movie is for younger children, but it is also a great movie for people my age. The story is about an ant named Flik. He brought havoc onto his colony when he destroyed the food that were for the superior grasshoppers. He gets banished and he must find bigger bugs to fix the mess. This movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a Pixar movie. The animation is brilliant especially for the late 90's. The story is good, but a little more detail would be suffice. The voice acting is good as with most animation movies. The music is nice to listen to. Nothing special, but it earned an nomination for one of the music categories. Overall, this movie struck me as awestruck. This is a good movie for all families. I rate this movie 10/10.",/review/rw0447208/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 1999,CharltonBoy,8," Great animation
",A Bugs Life is a great film that is not just for kids but for adults too. The story is set around a colony of ants and their struggle against the evil Grasshoppers who come back every year and steal their food ( A Mirror of the Magnifiscent seven). There is some wonderfull computer animation and the voices are great too. You will love it!!  8 out of 10,/review/rw0447208/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2021,Harry_Gleeson,10," Will Always Hold Up As An Animation Classic
","Overall, A Bug's Life is an animation classic without question. Along with Toy Story, it was one of Pixar's earliest films, and still till this day it is a fantastic watch with brilliant humour and loveable characters. It was one of the first animations I remember watching as a kid and for that reason it'll always be in my heart. A classic in every way, nothing to dislike or hate on, a brilliant film.

20 August 2018,patriciogl10,9," You are in for a treat.
","Is this perhaps the most underrated Pixar film to date? It could be, let's see: it's super entertaining, it has funny moments, creative bits of action and also small tender parts. The characters were built to know their place in this film, which in my personal view I would describe its plot as an ""adaptation"" (quote unquote because unofficially it is not) of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954), for they both consist of a small village or colony being subjugated by invaders demanding food during each invasion, but placed in a world of an animated colony of ants; so the protagonist, Flik, comes up with a great idea, to search for a group of ""warrior"" bugs (they are in fact members of a circus) to help them defeat the invaders, a group of malicious grasshoppers whose leader may be one of the best villains Pixar's creative team has ever offered, the evil Hopper. This movie also subtly touches the idea of revolution, as the ants ultimately wish to eradicate their raiders in order to live life peacefully. Another thing worth mentioning is the clever way in which they decide to deal with the grasshoppers, and although it is met with an unfortunate mishap, the denouement of the film is utterly satisfying, just wait and see if you haven't already! 
Oh, and the outtakes at the end of the movie are really ingenious and creative, not to mention funny! A great adventure that I would watch many many times, but I feel that with so many excellent films that Pixar has provided the public over the years this one may not rank as high as many others, which is why I believe that is somewhat underrated.",/review/rw0447208/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2019,mitsubishizero,9," One of Pixar's best movies
","This was a childhood movie of mine and needless to say it's aged well. The story's about a misfit named Flik (Dave Foley) who invents gadgets in hopes of improving his colony's work conditions but unsurprisingly they backfire and attract the ire of the other ants. It doesn't help that the ants are basically enslaved to the grasshoppers led by the cruel, manipulative and sadistic Hopper (Kevin Spacey) who threatens them after Flik accidentally destroys their food supply when one of his inventions backfire. After the grasshoppers leave Flik is tried afterwards where he convinces them to let him leave to get help for when the grasshoppers return. He treks to the big city where he comes across the Circus Bugs whom through a misunderstanding on both sides go back to his colony.",/review/rw0447208/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2012,Chanandler-Bong,9," A classic
","This was my favourite movie as a kid, or at least one of them. You can't go wrong with this film. It's different and clever, pure Pixar genius. Yeah the animation might be a bit dated but it's still brilliant. It's like old movies, the quality of the camera/film might not be so good but the film itself is brilliant. No child can't grow up without watching this at least once. Hopper used to terrify me! All in all, FANTASTIC film that's funny and enjoyable for everyone, no matter their age. Pixar, as usual are fantastic. They're one of my favourite film companies because I've seen all their animated movies, bar Cars 2, and each film is amazing and really enjoyable. You learn something and they're enjoyable for everyone. (Sorry have to write minimum 10 lines and I'm running out of things to say!!

22 March 2012,palmer1-320-821321,9," Super Disney Flick!
","""Bugs Life"" was blasted by the critics upon release, springing from the bowels of Disney not too long after the almost identical ""Antz"". However, as a stand-alone movie, it is difficult to fault. The characters and backgrounds are beautifully rendered but still look like computer animations. That might sound stupid but for those who think computer graphics can equal live-action, this film serves to debunk that idea. It does look good, no question, but compare this to the computer wizardry behind Gollum in the ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy and you'll see what I'm getting at. This is not much of a criticism though - it would be akin to disliking Scooby Doo (the series) because nobody says ""Zoinks!"" when they're scared.",/review/rw0447208/?ref_=tt_urv

25 November 2007,jaredmobarak,7," Flaming Death!A Bug's Life
","When watching A Bug's Life for the first time in a long while, I couldn't help but see the comparisons with last year's Happy Feet. As far as the main storyline goes, they are very similar, an outcast doing what he can to fit in while also attempting to be special. It just goes to show you how much better that film could have been without its liberal diatribe conclusion. A lot of people disagree with me when I say that I really like Pixar's sophomore effort. Sure it doesn't manage to capture the splendor of Toy Story, nor is the animation out of this world. However, the story is top-notch and the characters are wonderful to spend time with. With plenty of laughs and a moral center to boot, I could watch this one just as much as the studio's other classics.",/review/rw0447208/?ref_=tt_urv
