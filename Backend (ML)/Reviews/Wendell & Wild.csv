8 September 2005,Superunknovvn,10," The funniest, most intelligent thing since Monty Python
","Brits. You gotta love them. They got the best bands AND the best comedians. ""The Office"" is probably the best thing in comedy since Monty Python. This show is almost perfect. It's got an original concept, the writing is brilliant, and so is the acting. A group of people completely unknown outside of the U.K. has definitely made a mark in the history of television with this so-called ""mockumentary"".",/review/rw2205233/?ref_=tt_urv

","THE OFFICE is one of my all-time great comedy TV shows and up there with the classic likes of FAWLTY TOWERS and MONTY PYTHON. I recently rewatched the lot - series 1 & 2 and the Christmas specials - and am pleased to report it holds up now better than ever. Even more so perhaps, given that Ricky Gervais's subsequent TV offerings - EXTRAS and LIFE'S TOO SHORT - have come across as diluted variants of this show.",/review/rw2205233/?ref_=tt_urv

1 May 2016,deloudelouvain,10," For once the British and American humor are on the same level.
","When they took the decision to finish The Office I honestly was sad. Because you don't get much excellent series like this one. The character of Ricky Gervais is a delight to watch, even though everybody would probably hate the guy in real life. Well at least I would for sure. But in this series he's the funniest character to watch, as well as Mackenzie Crook's character. Actually the whole cast with the totally different characters are all good. When I saw that they sold the rights for an American version of The Office I really thought that it could not ever be the same. British and American humor are completely different so it took me years to finally decide to watch the American version. And that one I absolutely loved as well. So if you are sad like me when you watch the last episode of the British version I can only recommend you start watching the much longer American version.",/review/rw2205233/?ref_=tt_urv

14 April 2020,Ruskington,10," The finest TV comedy ever made
","Has there ever been a more perfect TV comedy than The Office? Personally, I don't think there has. The ability of the show to straddle the line between dour realism and laugh-out-loud hilarity is absolutely unmatched. Anyone who has ever worked in this kind of environment will appreciate how perfectly observed it is; the people, the atmosphere, the dialogue, the overbearing tedium. All the characters, including the background workers and warehouse staff, are perfectly constructed and every conversation is painfully realistic.",/review/rw2205233/?ref_=tt_urv

2 April 2021,fostrhod,10," It's a painful watch, but is a must watch
","The Office 2001-2003 BBC 14 episodes. ( first watched 2001, then about 2010) The boredom and tedium is highlighted in this ""mockumentary"" about the staff of a paper merchants in Slough. The setting is inessential but the interactions aren't. Tim one of the characters states ""you spend more time walking the same carpet with your colleagues, then you do with your own family"". There are two principal story lines, one featuring the office manager and the other being the tentative relationship between receptionist Dawn and sales rep Tim. The show is a painful watch, see the awkward and stilted conversations be the characters. It is painful but out of this comes, funny lines and very real situations. The cliches and bullying is very real. A lot of the humour is dated but because of this it highlights how fashions change and not always for the better.",/review/rw2205233/?ref_=tt_urv

",Having heard that the British version is not as good as the American it took me long time to finally watch this short TV show. I was pleasantly surprised. This show is actually really good. I can't say if American or British version are better until at least I watch the US version again. But I can surely say that this is definitely high class comedy and one should also not forget was the original idea.,/review/rw2205233/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2004,chasgoose,," Laughter through the tears
","While admitting to being a general Britcom slut (Fawlty Towers, Ab Fab, Monty Python,) with the exception of Coupling which I wasn't that big a fan of, I think The Office is quite possibly one of the greatest TV shows ever to be put on TV. The show takes a few viewings to really get all of the humor/tragedy that the brilliant Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant have built into the script of the show. The first time it seems sort of blah, but if you watch the whole 1st season, by episode 4 or 5 you pick up on the style of humor and realize that it lies mainly in the simple throwaway lines that the abhorrent David Brent and other employees of Wernham Hogg's Slough branch utter throughout the show. Also, like Gosford Park, the dialogue is very quiet and to an American not used to British accents it is tremendously helpful to put on the subtitles to understand what the characters are saying (it also makes the cringeworthy things that much more cringeworthy when you see them written out). Once you get the humor further viewing will allow you to appreciate the horror of ""The Office."" Watching all of Season 2 in a marathon viewing session left me so emotionally drained (even though I have never laughed harder in my life) that I was crying by the end and I couldn't tell if they were tears of sadness or laughter. At the same time I was relishing David Brent's demise, the new levels of obsequiousness and insensitivity he descends to by the end of the series is almost painful to watch. Tim and Dawn's will it happen/it won't happen relationship is one of the sweetest and most soul-crushing romances I have seen in television history ranking right up there with Sam and Diane from Cheers and Ross and Rachel from Friends. The beauty of ""The Office"" is it mixes some of the most hilarious sitcom humor with a level of epic tragedy that is hard to capture in any performing art form and does it so effortlessly that it is hard to tell where one begins and one ends. I cannot wait to see the special and finally finish the emotional roller coaster that was ""The Office.""",/review/rw2205233/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2022,nickenchuggets,10," ""You'll never have another boss like me""
","If you ask people what they think is the best comedy show to come out of the UK, most would probably say Monty Python due to its extensive history and groundbreaking performances that are still funny decades later. This might be true, but I think that the British version of The Office is a close second, and may as well be considered a modern day Monty Python. This show is hilarious for many reasons, but it's not really something I can write about easily because it consists of quite a few episodes and each one has a different premise. It doesn't have anywhere near as many episodes as its American counterpart, but you can argue that this is actually a bonus. Many fans of both shows will freely tell you how the british version is superior, not only because it came first, but also since it ended before it had a chance to decline. The Office is an incredibly funny (and vulgar) program that takes place somewhere you'd expect barely any laughter: an office. More specifically, it follows the various employees at a paper manufacturing company called Wernham Hogg. The office's manager is David Brent (Ricky Gervais), who is probably the type of boss nobody ever wants to have. He's a pretty terrible employee not because he oppresses his workers with tons of assignments, but because he does the total opposite and simply doesn't seem to care. Throughout the show, he's always trying to fraternize and make small talk with the other workers, which typically goes really badly. This brings me to the primary reason why the show is so funny. No other program seems to do uncomfortable silence better than this show. Almost every time David tries to have fun or make a joke, it results in a catastrophe of pure cringe and embarrassment. This series is filled to the brim with moments such as these, but I can't say what they are because they're so crude it's probably crossing the line (and boy is it hilarious). Although most of the comedy in the show comes from the other people reacting to whatever stupid things Brent is doing, that's not to say the other employees are boring characters. Also working at the office is Gareth Keenan (Mackenzie Crook), a former lieutenant in the Territorial Army who frequently gets in the way of Tim (Martin Freeman) and enjoys using his authority to push him around. The two always play pranks on each other, even though Gareth doesn't seem to realize he has little actual power in his job's hierarchy. Some of the funniest moments in the show stem from Tim questioning Gareth about his service in the reserve force using double entendres to make it sound like he is gay. Some other characters include Dawn (Lucy Davis), who works as the office's receptionist and is usually seen rejecting the advances of Tim. Her current boyfriend, Lee, makes it clear to Tim that he'd better look elsewhere for a girlfriend, even though Dawn and Lee's relationship is already hanging by a thread. In later episodes, we get introduced to Neil, who is the manager of a different branch of the paper company and David's eventual boss. Like almost everyone else, he's very put off by David's offensive and sexual humor, except he actually has the power to get him fired if he wants to. I love watching him and Neil interact with each other, because David still makes all these dirty and distasteful gags in front of him, regardless of his position. It's like he can feel himself being annoying but can't stop. I also can't talk about this show without mentioning the two Christmas specials which take place 3 years after the events of the show. I won't say what happens, but Wernham Hogg has no doubt changed a lot, and Brent's life will never be the same. Everyone working at the company undergoes some kind of change and moves on to something more important in their lives. Like many excellent shows/movies I talk about, there's no way I can fit all the things that make The Office great into one review. I know the american one is decent too, but nothing beats the awkward and uncouth humor of the original that makes you cringe and feel self-conscious every time you watch it. I think that's why this show is so important. It successfully manages to create comedic moments in a mundane setting such as an office, and because many people today are office workers, it makes the show highly relatable. If you work in a similar place, you're probably aware of how boring it can be, and while going through sensory depravation like that, you're practically begging for something amusing to happen to make the job more tolerable. It's not an easy show to watch because many of the awkward and humiliating moments are too relatable, but that is the main reason why this show is so great. If you've never watched this show and are interested in british humor, I can't recommend it highly enough. It's a prime example of how good that country is at comedy, and Ricky deserves praise for being one of the few men who can say and do such offensive things and still make people laugh.",/review/rw2205233/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2013,GRWeston,10," A cold, hilarious dose of reality
","I watched the entire series of The Office and the Christmas special exactly nine years ago, the same year I joined the corporate world. My timing could not have been better because already one year in, I had already become familiar - and annoyed - with the politics of the corporation and its more offensive personalities. Sooner or later, everyone in the corporate world ends up having a coworker like one at Wernham-Hogg, whether it be the team lead who is masculine in a way that proves he's insecure about his own masculinity and who wields what little power he has like a despotic king's scepter (Gareth), the sexist, condescending braggart who is unfairly successful with the ladies (Chris Finch) or of course the incompetent manager who would rather be popular than good and who hides his incompetence with pretension (David Brent). All of the series' situations are also genuine, especially the awkward, strained Christmas and year-end celebrations, the pointless staff appraisal sessions and the useless training class, which is the centerpiece of ""Training,"" my favorite episode. While reliving my least favorite corporate experiences made me wince, I laughed until my sides hurt at the same time, which explains The Office's reputation for popularizing cringe comedy. Still, despite the series' damning depiction of the workplace, at its core lies a big heart. You can see it in the way the show cares for Tim and Dawn, Wernham-Hogg's lone beacons of sanity and would-be romantic couple, but you really see it in how David Brent, the source of the series' most cringe-worthy moments, becomes the man you root for in the end. By providing the perfect outlet for my frustrations with the corporate world while making me not regret my decision to join it in the truest, most funny way possible, I easily rank The Office as my favorite TV show of all time.",/review/rw2205233/?ref_=tt_urv

30 November 2004,tim_bidet,," Genius
","""The Office"" is quite simply worth watching. I am tired of hearing people criticising it. It's not that it's not worthy of criticism, but the fact that those who label it as ""overrated"" and ""falling short of expectations"" have only ever seen one episode, or the Christmas Special, or 'The Dance'. It defies logic to make a judgment on a 14 episode programme on 2 feature-length episodes that merely act as a means of updating and rounding-off the series. I have yet to hear anyone make a solid argument as to why The Office fails in any way.",/review/rw2205233/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Brilliant and intelligent
","I love comedy, when it is funny, clever, intelligent and sophisticated. Imagine my surprise when I saw the first episode of The Office, huge surprise and in a very good way too. Since seeing the first episode I have been hooked on this show. Why? Because it is funny. The writing is a vast majority of the time hilarious while allowing some time to be intelligent as well. True there are one or two moments in Season 2 that are somewhat cringe worthy, but I always find myself laughing so hard and wiping away tears from my eyes, I don't mind so much. The production values are terrific, the direction is very well done consistently and the acting is wonderful. Whether I can stand Ricky Gervais or not is very dependent on the material and what he is in. Personally I don't mind him, but I am not his biggest fan either, but I have to admit he is right in his comfort zone here because he is just brilliant. The other actors also do really well, and all of the characters are likable and developed well. While The Office is often hilarious, the Christmas specials have had a poignant tone to them, that I appreciated. Overall, a wonderful comedy series. 10/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2205233/?ref_=tt_urv

15 March 2013,Artimidor,10," Mockumental comedy revolution
","Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant's rather unexpected 2001 baby in form of a mockumentary portraying an English workplace was one of the key moments of post-2000 British television. This is not another uniform situation comedy pulp with a new setting and/or accentuation, but brand new territory. And you better be ready for it as the punchlines aren't served on a plate, complete with canned laughter to give you an indicator on when something is intended to be funny. The humor lies in the format, the situation as such, generated by the mere presence of a camera team. Meant to capture the goings-on of everyday office life for a documentary this voyeuristic outside force - and thus indirectly the viewer - serves as the perfect catalyst to bring the true hierarchies, relationships and confrontations in the business life context to the forefront. Gervais himself plays David Brent, the boss of a small paper company, who sees himself not only as an unrecognized, highly talented entertainer, but is also so full of himself that he redefines comedy in the process of presenting himself in front of the camera. Actually he gives the word cringeworthy new meaning. In his office the usual stuff happens you might have witnessed in a similar environment: sucking up, skirmishes among colleagues, practical and dirty jokes, an office romance, the fear of the closing of the branch, redundancy looming. ""The Office"" has the look and feel of real life, and the actors, especially Martin Freeman (as Tim) and Mackenzie Crook (Garreth), complement Gervais' tour de force brilliantly. Just as in real life this small series has it all: humor in all variations, even if it's over the top, a bit of drama and even a dose of melancholy. Must-see.",/review/rw2205233/?ref_=tt_urv
