2 April 2017,studioAT,9," Actually not that bad. Lovely even
","Like other people I was a bit sceptical when this sequel to 'Love Actually', one of the most beloved Christmas films ever, was announced. As much fun as it would be to revisit the characters, it seemed a bit of a gimmick, albeit it one for a good cause.",/review/rw6628344/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2019,vkester,8," Love it ... Actually
","Would love to purchase a full version of UK and US versions. Can only find poorly edited y-tube type copies, there has to be official releases which the monies go to proper red nose .... Come on, please release a DVD of both versions and maybe include outakes / bloopers. Could make some nice new funds for red nose.",/review/rw6628344/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2017,percyjackson_ttx,10," Feel like an old friend
","I remember the first time watching ""Love Actually"" was 2011, hiding in the blanket so that my mom could not know that I hadn't sleep in midnight. And this film has changed my life, my point of view about love. It really stays around us, if we know how to feel it.",/review/rw6628344/?ref_=tt_urv

","Red Nose Day Actually could easily been Smug Actually in this ten minute sequel to Love Actually. It is from the original writer Richard Curtis, one of the founders of Comic Relief.",/review/rw6628344/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2017,Horst_In_Translation,6," Good cause, good sequel
","""Red Nose Day Actually"" is a 15-minute live action short film from the UK that aired a week ago (March 2017) for the first time and shows us how things have changed in the last 1.5 decades for the protagonists from the very successful ""Love Actually"". So we get to see Neeson, Grant, Knightley, Firth and others in here once again reprising their roles from (even today) one of the most beloved Christmas films of all time. The very first scene was my favorite right away. I did not remember the actor from ""The Walking Dead"" was actually in ""Love Actually"" and boy I also did not remember how young Keira Knightley was back when this film came out. Anyway, back to this one here, it gets a bit weaker after the first scene, but it's still pretty solid and I recommend checking it out, especially to the biggest ""Love Actually"" fans. Those really don't want to miss out. Oh yeah, writer and director is of course again Richard Curtis and looking at how rarely he directed anything this is quite an honor, even if these 15 minutes probably also mean we will never be getting a LA sequel. Shame. But we take what we can get. See it, a really nice idea for this year's Red Nose Day.",/review/rw6628344/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2017,gavin_vedder,9," More than a simple TV movie
","Just watch it, and it's a ten minute sequel!! I dare to say that it's a kind of ""check in on you""...and actually it's a funny unpretentious short film with a big heart! Maybe it's not a work of art, but it wasn't the point anyway. Red Nose it's a wonderful fund-raising event, cheers up for everyone who contributed for this movie.",/review/rw6628344/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2020,sophiahwright,8," Rick Grimes does it again
",It's worth watching just to watch Andrew Lincoln. What a babe.,/review/rw6628344/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2021,mickman91-1,6," Fair play for getting all the big stars back and doing it properly. I think more could have been done with the time though.
","Love Actually is such a classic british film you cannot deny however hard you may try. Many people have seen it a million times as it has become the quintessential christmas film. Red Nose Day Actually wasn't just a cheap pastiche, they got many of the original cast in character, including Hugh Grant and Colin Firth and Liam Neeson etc. So all the memories and feel of the original flood back to you. However, overall it wasn't that interesting just to see how the characters have aged. That was kind of Sad Actually. I think they could have done much more with the 15 minutes. And I don't know why Hugh Grant as Prime Minister mentioned Metallica's new album along with other events marking how the country has changed in the 13 years between the films, as Metallica are an american band.",/review/rw6628344/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2018,lilpurpleangel,9," LOVE Love Actually...
","Hilarious, silly even, short sequel to Love Actually. Quick mini updates on most of the main characters. I do believe though, that if I did not have such a great sense of humor, and were I not still a huge fan of the original movie, my rating would not be nearly so high for Love Actually 2.",/review/rw6628344/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2021,daisyisabaker,2," Limited access, unwatchable
","What's the point? Years later and I'm in the UK, still unable to find somewhere to watch it?
The only versions I can find are dodgey 360p low quality copies on Daily Motion.",/review/rw6628344/?ref_=tt_urv
