27 September 2001,bob the moo,," Very funny if you live in Smith's world
","I guess that people can be split in two ways - those that like Kevin Smith's films and those that don't.  From watching his films, he seems to like his characters to exist in his strange world where things are exaggerated and ridiculous characters do unrealistic things.",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv

","After being dumped by their girlfriends, T.S. Quint(Jeremy London) and Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) go to the mall to keep their minds off the situation. Soon, however, thoughts turn to getting their ladies back and the dynamic duo will have to fight mall security, a fashionable male (Ben Affleck) and a game show producer (Michael Rooker) in order to succeed.",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv

","After being dumped by their girlfriends, T.S and Brodie decide to head to the mall for the day to forget their worries. But after all the mayhem they manage to get up to in the mall, they just can't get their ex-girlfriends off their mind. So the two team up with the help of Jay and Silent Bob to come up with a plan to win them back.

15 August 2007,Chrysanthepop,," Wacky Comedy in a Shopping Mall
","'Mallrats' but is the kind of film you either like or don't like which is pretty much the case with any Kevin Smith movie. I liked it. I enjoyed all the dirty street humour, the awkwardness, the characters and the concept.",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2002,"David, Film Freak",," It's not there to win any awards. It's not there as a cinematic masterpiece. It's just there.
","The second movie in Kevin Smith's 5 film View Askewniverse series is Mallrats - a charming comedy about two losers, who, after being dumped by their girlfriends decide to spend a day at the mall. - and try and win their girls back. Jason Lee and Jeremy London play the dumped-and-depressed duo of ex-boyfriends who both succeed in bringing to life the characters of . Shannen Doherty and Claire Forlani - the two ex-girlfriends also perform well here. It's been said - not just by critics and fans, but by Kevin Smith himself, that Mallrats is a bad movie - and by far the worst of his 5. Personally, I rate this 3rd... with Dogma in front, and Chasing Amy last - I found this movie to be funny, charming and completely entertaining. Ben Affleck's character was also funny to watch. Jay & Silent Bob appear to add the cartoon comedy flavour, while Stan Lee cameos in an hilarious performance of himself.",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2021,bgaiv,5," Feels like a high school play with a budget
","There's a lot of surprisingly weak acting here, surprising considering the material doesn't require much heavy lifting. It often comes across as a high school play.",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2003,bradc-2,," Best watched with eyes closed?
","As most Smith fanboys know, Mallrats has been trashed critically, financially (bad box-office) and by a lot of Smith's own fan-base.",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2006,incomprehendible,10," Wow is the only thing to say here.
","this is an incredible movie and if your a clerks fan (which I'm assuming is the only Kevin smith film you've seen because its blasphemous to watch them out of order) then this is even better. mallrats is the kind of movie you watch once on DVD and don't take it out of the drawer, because you know you'll wanna watch it later. its laugh out loud funny and anyone remotely interested in the inner workings of a geek or, like me, you are a geek, then this will give voice to the geek generation and make it cool. Recently, The OC has made comic books cool in the form of Seth Cohen. but before there was Seth, there was Brodie.",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2007,FiendishDramaturgy,7," If you can find the mindset, this is heartwarming and entertaining. Otherwise, it's a pointless waste of time
","This is a niche film. If you can put yourself into the mindset of a 20-something slacker, who has no ambition whatsoever in life, this film may engender some sense of emotional investment in its characters and a sense of identifying with same. However, if this situation is impossible for you, then you will not only not see the humor herein, you will most likely bemoan the time wasted in its viewing.",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 1999,Adriane,," Oh please everybody, this movie is great!
","To everybody who did not like this movie: You are not obviously Kevin Smith fans. I am, and everyone one of the NJ3 are great. This one is just different. Shannen Doherty is surprisingly cool in this one, and Jason Lee is hysterical. Jay and Silent Bob are hysterical as usual, and everyone else is great. Watch if you are a Smith fan, just keep an open mind.",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2003,MovieLuvaMatt,7," Glad it received a cult audience
","""Mallrats"" has found a great cult audience, now that it's out on video and DVD, despite the fact that it was a huge bomb at the box office.  That's great to know.  And of course, Kevin Smith fans adore the film as well.  I happen to be one of those fans, and I always enjoy watching this movie.  It has many great lines, though in Kevin Smith tradition, sometimes he falls so much in love with his dialogue that it sometimes feels stilted.  I still love the film, but I can't deny that the dialogue doesn't always appear natural.  But at least the dialogue is intelligent, which something Smith never gets full credit for.  Critics and angry audiences spend too much time dwelling on the profane nature of his work, yet there's tons of comedies out there that are profane, but not the damn bit intelligent.  Jason Lee gives a memorable performance as Brodie.  This is the role he was born to play! He's up there with Jason Alexander when it comes to playing the neurotic best friend.  Michael Rooker also seems to be having a lot of fun, playing a great villain.  As for Claire Forlani, I can never get over her disastrous American accent.  I'm guessing she learned from her mistakes before doing other American films like ""Meet Joe Black,"" ""Antitrust"" and ""Boys and Girls.""  In all of those films, she seems to pull off the accent without a hitch.  I don't understand why the studio tried to cut down on the film's use of profanity.  Just another example of a**hole studio execs trying to take advantage of the independent filmmaker.  As if we don't see any studio films with strong pervasive language.  ""Pulp Fiction"" was also a Miramax film.  'Nuff said.  You know damn well these execs are prejudice against certain filmmakers.  I guess they just assume Smith is some young Neandrathal.  Eh, screw them.  Though I laughed a good deal, I still find the chocolate-covered pretzel gag downright disgusting.  But overall this film is definitely worth checking out!

13 January 2003,ericjg623,8," Fly, fatass, fly!
","This is Kevin Smith's first `real' movie, i.e., one made with a real budget, real actors, and backed by a real studio. It was also a commercial and critical flop, most reviewers seem to regard it as his worst movie. That is understandable, seeing as he set such high expectations with `Clerks', a work of pure genius that was made on a budget so low that Smith was forced to use black & white film. `Clerks' is one of my all time favorite films, a classic that will probably still be popular many years from now, and so, by comparison, `Mallrats' simply doesn't measure up. But so what? It's still a great comedy, with lots of moments that make you want to split a gut, and is, IMHO, better than at least 90% of the other teenage/young adult movies out there.",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2006,theshadow908,8," Hilarious comedy
","Mallrats tells the story of two friends who are dumped by their girlfriends on the same day. They seek solace at the local mall where they hang out all day doing nothing but talk about their girlfriends and comic books. They get into a series of situations that eventually leads to the two enlisting the help of slackers Jay and Silent Bob to get their girlfriends back. This is the second film in the ""New Jersey"" series by Kevin Smith. This entry is miles better than its predecessor Clerks.",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2001,kergillian,7," You can't go wrong with Kevin Smith!!
","Granted, it's weaker than his other three films to date. On the other hand, a weak Kevin Smith movie is stronger than a strong film by most other writers/directors. This film is hilarious! It takes mall culture to a higher level! A good contrast to Richard Linklater's/Eric Bogosian's Suburbia, though it's better than Suburbia in most ways. Many of the pop culture refs and the satire of young adult life make this film even cooler! And how the hell did he get Stan Lee to appear? (And he was surprisingly really good!)",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2004,gtc83,1," Truly, genuinely horrible
","This movie is about two of the most unlikable, unsympathetic losers ever portrayed in recent memory.  They get dumped by their girlfriends - really they should get dumped by the entire world.  They are self-centered in the extreme, immature in the extreme, and incredibly annoying.  The whole movie is based on a single gimmick:  take an actual conversation, transcribe it into Microsoft Word, then use the thesaurus tool to replace every adjective with more obscure ones.  That's it.  It goes on without pause for the entire film - people talk about nothing in this ""clever"" way.  I just saw the film last night and I honestly can't remember a single topic of any conversation that took place.  Needless to say, the two main characters are beyond shallow.  They don't have any personalities other than that they like video games, comic books, and they just will not stop talking - ever.  Even though they never say anything.  We're supposed to be impressed by the clever use of oddball words, for instance calling a pool table a ""gaming table"". Man, wouldn't you just love to sit through two hours of people doing this?  Let me tell you, it makes Pauly Shore and his screwball take on Valley Girl talk seem enjoyable by comparison.",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2002,Tiger_Mark,1," Not so clever
","Wow! Bad acting and a not very witty script mixed with a lame plot. What is Mallrats? This film was a wannabe Marx Brothers movie, without humor. I have never seen lines delivered with such little inspiration. It was almost like the characters got one read off of a cue card and that was a wrap. I am sure that Smith thought the jokes were witty as hell on paper, but they lost something in the transition to the spoken word.I loved Clerks and Chasing Amy, but this movie sucked!",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2003,allar100,7," Jason Lee is King!!!!
","This is really a starring vehicle for Jason Lee.  Lee seems to be the bright point in all of Kevin Smith's films.  Technically this film is like all of Kevin Smith's others.  Not alot of camera movement, imperfect editing, the usual.  But that is not what really matters.  The story and the comedic timing is what is most important, and Smith has more than enough to go around.  7/10",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2019,Mr-Fusion,7," A cesspool of slackers
","Easily one of the lightest and hijink-filled Kevin Smith movies, ""Mallrats"" is the unlikely love story buried in a tale of consumerist tomfoolery. There are all sorts of little things happening in this movie that make me laugh, but you've gotta hand it to Jason Lee for really shouldering this thing. The man's working in shades of irate and I don't think he fails to pull off a single line. This is proof he was born to play Banky Edwards in Chasing Amy, and his rage never fails to delight. Doesn't matter what kind of day I'm having, simply hearing him yell ""That kid is on the escalator again!"" is always a mood-brightener.",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2003,WrathChld,," ""I love the smell of commerce in the morning""
","I was originally going to write how ""Clerks"" managed to accomplish allot more than Mallrats with a much much smaller budget, but why kill the fun. This movie is great and a welcome addition to the world that Kevin Smith has created.  Instead of the wise-ass remarks from the ""loveable"" Randal, we have the great Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) ripping up the screen with his rude and crude observations.  Mallrats is fun, enjoyable, and the one Smith movie you don't have to pay attention to, to enjoy.",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 1999,Spleen,8," An amiable movie that shows us that even mallrats are human
","Whereas `Clerks' wasn't certain whether it was gritty realism or goofy fantasy, `Mallrats' KNOWS it's goofy fantasy.  That's exactly the right way to play it.  No-one has ever had a profound thought in a modern shopping mall.  Any film that makes claims to the contrary is lying.",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2002,bopdog,5," Kevin Smith may be a 'genius', but ""Mallrats"" is a poopy movie (like his others)
","I'm a fan of ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,"" as well as ""Dogma"" and the other Smith flicks. Smith, even when he's being corny or sophomoric or otherwise ""not real wise,"" exudes a living truth, a sense of ""art"" that provides a nice core to his movies. Who's to say exactly what 'art' is (and Lord help us when anyone tries), but for me, movies take on an importance and watchability when my experience extends beyond the mere plot. That is, when the movie somehow, and on some level, wakes me up at least a little bit, and gets me to reflect upon more than the characters on the screen.",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv

",Mallrats is perhaps the best film of Kevin Smith with Clerks For these reasons.,/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2002,tedg,," A Cursed Afflection
","Spoilers herein.  Another show about a show as a poor substitute for the scaffolding of the Divine Comedy used for `Clerks.'  What is interesting is the DVD commentary which tells us a lot about Ben Affleck. Some bad actors don't annoy me, but Ben and Matt really do. That's because of the damage they did to the mind behind the art in `Good Will.'  Here, you get a feel for where Ben comes from, and Kevin bears some of the blame. The idea is: `Hey! let's get a buncho friends together and make a movie. It will be about superficialities, but that's the point.' But Kevin knows who he is goofing on and it is all in good fun. Ben doesn't, and it isn't. Kevin is smarter than his subject, Ben very much dumber.  He convinced Smith and Mosier to help him out, so they produced `Will,' leveraging their own goodwill. With `Will' the vision was less tight than with a Smith-written bit so the studio was able to gloss it up.  But you can see Ben in his real persona here. As his career grows (as it surely will) this film will become more and more a goof on him than a goof on Jay. You can see the influence of Bob and Jay in Will's characters.",/review/rw1896979/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2008,yearspew,8," Decent Enough Comedy.
