20 March 2021,selmasbektas,10," Finally a Bosnian movie that tells about the crimes in Srebrenica
","It was an ongoing debate in my family if we should watch the movie or not. My mother is from Srebrenica and we lost a huge part of our family and amongst them my grandpa. The wounds are still open and will be no matter how long time passes and my mother's memories are still as vivid as if it was yesterday. Having seen a few bad movies left us not wanting to se another one on that subject because directors ( particularly Jolie) tried in a way to romanticize the war even though there is NOTHING ROMANTIC about that war. A huge loss, suffering and vivid memories of near friend and family being killed and tortured is something that my mother lives with daily. So I watched the movie first and later we saw it together. And it hits you to the core. I think that Jasmila Zbanic accomplished something great by leaving out horror scenes and making us just imagine. Because no scene can ever compare with the reality of crime and horrors that happened. In a few segments of the movie we had to pause because they felt so real to my mother that she started to look for my grandpa in the scenes with people outside the UN zone hq. We highly recommend everyone to see this movie and to never forget about Srebrenica.",/review/rw6190076/?ref_=tt_urv

","... because you never learn! The despicable, diabolical and disgusting events from Srebrenica, replayed many times before, currently playing out in several countries now, and quite probably for the foreseeable future while we continue to turn a blind eye, ignore, disengage or perhaps don't care.

16 June 2021,CinemaClown,," A Searing Account Of Human Injustice & International Indifference
","Nominated for Best International Feature Film at the last Oscars, Quo vadis, Aida follows a UN translator's plight to save her family from imminent death in the wake of Bosnian War and also covers the events that led to the Srebrenica massacre. A powerful, heartbreaking & devastating account of human injustice & global apathy, this Bosnian war drama is one of the best films of its year.",/review/rw6190076/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2021,j_m_jovicic,10," Great movie
",The main actress Jasna Djuricic deserves an Oscar. She gave such a great portrayal of a mother and a wife who's traying her best in the worst of situation. God forbid anyone finds themselves in that situation.,/review/rw6190076/?ref_=tt_urv

",I am a guy from Serbia and I gave this movie 10/10 because it has really good script and it is true work of art. I wish directors from Serbia would make more films which are as good as this one.,/review/rw6190076/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2021,biloskata,9," Everyone should watch this!!!!
","This film is a must see! I am from Croatia and my father fought the war so I was pretty much familiar with the events depicted in the film but nevertheless I had goosbumps during couple of scenes and it definitely educated me on some things I didn't know like the fact that the UN was just useless. I think war has to be one of the most heartbreaking things to happen to a person and this film depicted it perfectly. The acting is amazing and just the overall feeling is perfectly translated. I recommend this film to anyone, escpecially those who are not familiar with the events surrounding it.",/review/rw6190076/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2020,chong_an,9," A powerful portrait of a historical moment.
","This is about events around the Srebrenica massacre in 1995. The UN promised that this would be a safe zone, but doesn't back up its ultimatums with action, leaving the small contingent of UN peacekeepers helpless in the face of stronger Serbian forces, who step-by-step get bolder, take over the town, and eventually the civilians seeking safety at the UN base.",/review/rw6190076/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2020,Come-and-Review,10," A powerful statement

7 May 2021,evanston_dad,9," Gut Wrenching
","I'm not proud to say it, but I was barely paying attention to the war in Bosnia when it was happening. ""Quo Vadis, Aida?"" brings it right into your living room with all the immediacy of a documentary. It's a gut wrenching, sensational film.",/review/rw6190076/?ref_=tt_urv

13 April 2021,Cineanalyst,8," The Return Gaze of a Genocide
","The Bosnian entry for the Best International Feature Academy Award, ""Quo Vadis, Aida?"" is better than the odds-on favorite to actually win the Oscar, ""Druk"" (a.ka. ""Another Round,"" 2020), being that it's actually about something that matters and is emotionally devastating--so much so that the eponymous Aida literally begs to make a Sophie's Choice at one point. The protagonists in both are teachers, and neither one ultimately affects any real change, but one is living history while the other rambles to high-schoolers about his famous favorite fellow drunkards. Both pictures are alienating: this one forcing us to witness the horrific Srebrenica massacre that we're unable to alter, and the other makes one feel like the designated driver to a bunch of binge-drinking dolts whining about their so-called mid-life crises. As opposed to waiting impatiently to drive the inebriated teachers home, however, ""Quo Vadis, Aida?"" does well to pull the spectator into the chaos. There's nary a dull moment in following Aida (as played rivetingly well by Jasna Duricic--seriously, Academy, you missed a nominee) around a makeshift UN refugee camp as she frantically tries to save the lives of her husband and two sons from the approaching slaughter by Ratko Mladic's Bosnian Serb Army and as the United Nations and their so-called, shorts-wearing peace keepers impotently stand by and refuse to help.",/review/rw6190076/?ref_=tt_urv

","As an interpreter, I took a special interest in Jasmila Zbanic's Academy Award-nominated ""Quo vadis, Aida?"". The protagonist is an interpreter in Srebrenica during the 1995 siege. In the process of interpreting between the townspeople and peacekeeping forces, she gains some important information.",/review/rw6190076/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2021,savosaint,10," Beautiful, emotional
","Wonderful movie, it translates the emotions of the mother perfectly, this movie pays homage to all the woman that lost their sons, brothers, husbands and fathers in the genocide, and still stood strong in the face of pure hatred.
The movie just like any others, has its limitations, shortcomings, you can't film genocide in 1.5 hours, but the movie language is amazing in this one, all my emotions had been engaged, in one movie!",/review/rw6190076/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2021,sackofwhine,9," Respectful and devastating cinema
","Films that depict a historical event are always such a tricky business. On the one hand, they can shed light on that event, and thus offer the audience education and information about events they may not have known, on the other hand, it happens again and again in film history that the events were distorted for the purpose of their own propagandistic ideology, at the expense of the individuals who experienced those events. These events are then given a dramatic narrative, which in itself (for many critics like Mr. Haneke) represents a moral dilemma. Is it allowed, or should it be allowed, to re-stage such historical tragedies at all? Even in the context of art, one should not extract moments of tension from certain real events in order to manipulate the audience into having an emotional reaction to these cinematographic elements.",/review/rw6190076/?ref_=tt_urv

","Based on true events of Bosnia's Srebrenica massacre, 'Quo Vadis, Aida?' is a spellbinding piece of work that tells a powerful, important story. Jasmila Zbanic draws us into the events, finding an effective blend of historical reconstruction, family drama, and war-based thriller. Jasna Duricic' is a revelation.

15 May 2021,I_Ailurophile,10," Difficult, but essential
","War movies so often glorify battle, downplaying the human cost. Dramas that unfold with armed conflict in the background tend to minimize the brutality at hand. 'Quo va dis, Aida?' is a film that pointedly zeroes in on that human cost, while also ensuring we get a clear picture of military involvement.",/review/rw6190076/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2021,ajdinbajramovic,8," Deeply emotional
","The film covers the topic on Srebrenica genocide, which was committed in 1995 in Bosnia. It is portrayed through a family story, with Aida, a translator for the UN, as the main character.

19 October 2020,aisabubica,10," Masterpiece!
","An amazing movie with such a strong message. It shows a war in Bosnia, in Srebrenica specifically, from a different perspecitve. It shows UN force, their passivity and inability to help bosnian people. I loved Aida as a character and I think women like her are a true heroines of war in Bosnia. She lost everything, but she continues to fight and live her life. Amazing scene at the end of the movie with a little children, a new after war generation, made me cry!",/review/rw6190076/?ref_=tt_urv
