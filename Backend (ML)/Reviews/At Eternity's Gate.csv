19 September 2020,Foutainoflife,7," No Doubt This Is A Divisive Film And You Can Easily See That In The Reviews
","Ok. So there are a lot of people taking issue with this due to the current politial environment in the US, some are taking issue with it because they feel it is a ""The Village"" remake and some are taking issue with it because they see it more as a thriller than horror. I guess you will decide how you like it based on your position concerning these issues.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2021,FeastMode,7," DON'T WATCH THE TRAILERS
","It never ceases to baffle me how often trailers spoil a movie. For antebellum, i went in blind, and it took me on a ride i won't forget. I watched the trailer after. It spoiled the entire movie. I can't believe it. And on top of that, it was completely misleading. I'm so glad i don't watch trailers any more. It would have robbed me of a great experience.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2020,view_and_review,4," Trailers Were Misleading
","I'd like to sue for false advertisement. The trailers for this movie truly misled me. I was under the impression this was going to be a horror movie with supernatural occurrences. In the trailer the scenes jumped from present day to antebellum era, then there was a scene of a plane suddenly appearing in the sky above a slave plantation as if they were in a parallel universe where slavery lasted past the industrial age. There was a flash scene of a woman bending over backwards like she was an evil spirit. The whole of it painted a very eerie picture with otherworldly undertones.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2020,jtindahouse,9," Original, unique and extremely tense - a must-see
",It feels like I have been waiting for 'Antebellum' to come out for an eternity. Ever since I first heard about it I have been aching to see it. It just looked like such a well put together film and such a mysterious and interesting plot. Finally tonight I got to see it and I can confirm all of those things were true and much more as well. This film was gripping from start to finish.,/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2020,Mehki_Girl,10," Thoroughly Enjoyed The Movie
",Performances were great. The cinematography as well. The beginning sequence grabs your attention and makes you want to watch the movie.,/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2020,Xstal,8," The Past is Never Dead...
","As polarising a film as you'll see all year, that Janelle Mon√°e felt strongly enough to take the lead and that the film needed to be made in the first instance, says so much about the inequalities, prejudice and hatred that continues to exist in societies: but you knew that because you see it in the news and on social media every day and quite probably have become immune to its impact - which is why it continues to perpetuate through generations and is as tough to eradicate as the common cold.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2020,deloudelouvain,9," Why would you give this a negative score is a total mystery to me.
","I'm glad I didn't read anything about this movie before watching it, and certainly not all those extremely negative reviews on here. I wouldn't read anything if I were you so you'll be as surprised as I was when the twists and turns unfolds. Because even if I was surprised and mostly sceptic in the beginning of the first turn I have to admit that was some clever writing from Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. I didn't see it coming at all and that's what makes it even better. I don't know why people have to compare it to the things that happen in real life now, it's pointless, it's a movie, nothing else, but a pretty good one. The acting was very good from the whole cast, the directing and cinematography on top, and the story surprising, engaging, and mysterious. One of the better movies I've seen in a long time and I watch two to three movies every day. You could compare it to Get Out for the theme, but it's a totally different story, so I wouldn't.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2020,mr_bickle_the_pickle,8," I dont get the low scores
","I honestly dont understand why this has such a low rating except maybe for the fact that some white people upset that white people being portrayed as the villains. Or is it because its another slave movie? I've also seen some people complain that its not really a horror like its advertised, and ok...it does feel ,more like a thriller than a true horror but that doesnt make it less captivating. I was really invested in Eden/Veronica and the mystery of how she's seemingly in the 1800s deep south. The twist isnt super complicated, I was able to make a guess that turned out right. But again, this didnt detract from my enjoyment of the film. I thought it had a very interesting storyline. I wont say the film the is perfect. Jena Malone (especially during the last act) does a bit of scenery chewing as the villain. I also thought the end in general with Eden/Veronica riding on horseback in slow-mo felt a little hokey. It was maybe a little confusing why Eden/Veronica was made out to be the ""saviour"". I get she is the main character but it didnt make sense why out of everyone Julia specifically went to her for help. And I didnt see much chemistry between Eden?Veronica and her friend Dawn. But really other than that, I wasn't disappointed with the film and found it fascinating.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2021,kosmasp,10," Then and now
","I avoided watching the trailer, so I can't talk about what is given away there, though I can imagine it will be quite a bit. Because going into this I was taken aback by how this begins and even more so, when it transitions. The whole structure actually made me rewatch parts of this - partly to see if I was right with what I was thinking at the time and partly because I expected to have a better insight and maybe see certain things I missed the first time around.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2020,movieman6-413-929510,4," Music video clip directors turn their first cinema film into a messy unoriginal film.
","Antebellum is a new horror thriller directed, written and produced in part by Gerard Bush and Christopher Renze. This is only their first real cinema film that they have directed together. For this they have made more short films, especially music video clips.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2020,rjmhulst,8," Surprising, thrilling and twisted
","Antebellum may not be a horror movie like the trailer suggests, however: it is all about the horrors its main characters go through. Antebellum is an interesting ride throughout, with much contrast, a strong ambience and great acting.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2021,Pukeonthestreet,9," Went in not sure what it was going to be
","And by the end I was in awe. Such a great movie. Should they have billed it as horror? Absolutely, it is some real life horror.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2020,glennmeerten06,7," Antebellum, a picture stifled by a 1000 words
","Antebellum tells the remarkable story of Eden, a slave on a plantation somewhere in America. It also chronicles events in the life of a successful modern-day author called Veronica. As the film progresses, the connection between these two storylines becomes clear, and that's about all I can say about the plot.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2020,jasminepixie,5," Why Didn't The Writer and Production
","Why didn't the writer and production team spend more time developing this story? This movie had the potential to be very interesting .One that would of been a must see, but it falls short. At first I was intrigued as well as excited,but as the movie shifted to the last part I started to get a sense of where it was heading. It just was not as clever as I had thought it would be. It is missing so much of the story and creative elements that you are left wanting. The ending twist is revealed so quickly, it makes the twist stupid. If it would of been presented in a different way it may have changed my impressions.
I will say it is visually appealing but that doesn't make up for the substance it lacks. I will tell you truly the last thoughts and feeling I had when the ending credits started was ""What it is over, where is the rest?"" Followed by a feeling of thorough disappointment.
So in short the movie starts of interesting and ends with you feeling disenchanted and let down.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2020,roganoffeski,4," Woof, that was hard work...
","It's been a long while since I've looked at my phone halfway through a movie to see how much longer it has left, but that's how disappointing this was.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2020,BandSAboutMovies,5," Great in idea, not execution
","Antebellum is a movie that would have been much better if I'd never seen the trailer and if the big reveal didn't happen until much later in the movie. As it stands, it's still interesting, but it would have really knocked me out if I had no idea what I was in store for. So that's why I'm giving you the opportunity to look away now, because you deserve to see this with no expectations.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2020,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,9," Outstanding cinematography, Twilight Zone Ron Serling worthy.
","From the very opening scene this film grabs your attention. The cinematography and the soundtrack of the opening scene is absolutely brilliant, outstanding and emotional. The first thought that will come into your head is, ""Wait, is this a horror film or a historical civil war drama?"" That's what I found was so amazing about this film in that it completely misleads the viewer in the beginning. But if you ever loved the Twilight Zone anthology series with Ron Serling, you will be in for a treat because this film isn't at all what it seems.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2020,catfanatic888,8," WHY THE HATE? Give it a chance!!!
","I like many others had a different type of movie in mind when we saw this. I think it's very misleading to pull a bait & switch on your audience by promoting one type of film an then delivering something completely different. That said, the HORROR shown I this movie was of a historical nature-the brutality that slavery WAS in our country in the South. There ARE monsters but they are the slave owners who own the plantations and torment the slaves. It makes me so sad to see Black Americans being treated that way. That was the worst time in the USA and it breaks my heart. Racism of any kind is repulsive and should never be tolerated by anyone. We are all equal and deserve love, respect and kindness.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2020,tccandler,3," It had nothing to say... and it said it loudly.
","I like Janelle Mon√°e, but she is utterly wasted in this absurd film with an even more absurd twist. The woke message is an obvious one, spread too thickly, and one that comes across as preaching to the choir. The violence is exploitative and feels gratuitous. I didn't like this film at all. It had nothing to say... and it said it loudly.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2021,carlamperez-09041,9," Haters gonna hate
","Idk why everyone is hating on this so hard? I'd never seen the trailer, just randomly saw it on Hulu and decided to give it a watch. Didn't know what to expect and had never watched the trailer... but it kept me puzzled and kept me guessing all throughout which are all the things I can appreciate in a film. I'd categorize it as more of a psychological thriller than say ""horror"" but once that twist hit and I realized this was happening NOW?! that blew my mind and I definitely became horrified- with the idea of being in those shoes. Like WHAT?! scurry. Anyway, yall are all haters and this was a decent movie. Goodbye~",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2020,zac-68274,10," Ironic How The Low Rating Racist Couldn't See The Monsters
",Janelle Mon√°e never disappoints. Great storyline but the cinematography was imperfect. The racist are too illiterate to appreciate the implications of the movie scenarios and acknowledge that America has been Humane to certain groups of people so long(Since 1619) that it's the norm for the oppressor and the oppressed!,/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2020,johannes2000-1,10," Cinematographically brilliant, with a harsh message.
","I was blown away by this movie. First there's the message, it's heavy and cynical, it's #blacklivesmatter smacking you right in the face and belly. As a North-European white man I hardly dare to pretend to know anything of what black people in America have to cope with, I guess (and sure hope!) that this movie has enlarged it for the sake of the argument. But it chilled me to the bone watching all the goings-on in the first half hour, even thinking (unjustified, as it turned out) that this was all in the past. If just a fraction of the frame of mind that could make such a violent and degrading attitude towards black people is a reality today, then there are still mountains of prejudice and hate to be demolished.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2021,JamesHitchcock,4," The past is not dead. It's not even past.
","""Antebellum"" is a film in three acts. Act I is set (or so we are led to believe) on a Louisiana slave plantation during the American Civil War. The plantation has recently been taken over by the Confederate Army, and the slaves are treated harshly. They are routinely beaten, female slaves are raped and any who attempt to escape are killed.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2021,danielthompsonfp,6," This film had a clear message!
","This film had a clear message, and I believe it's mediocre rating is solely because many people weren't ready to see it. Great plot twist, kept me interested, great acting, exceptional cinematography.. it's not necessarily a ""must see"", but it's definitely not as terrible as the majority of reviews make it out to be.",/review/rw6538646/?ref_=tt_urv
