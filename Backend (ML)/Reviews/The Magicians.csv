","First of all, just about anything created and written by Ava DuVernay is going to be great, so I'm glad that she contributed to each episode. But anyway, I love when good old white Amerikkka is exposed! I wasn't surprised to see the rating so low even before the series was aired! The evil ones didn't even watch it and they already had their minds made up! It happens all the time, but who cares about the rating. As long as it makes ""them"" feel uncomfortable about the truth, so be it.",/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's pretty obvious who the people giving the 1 star reviews are. Obviously they have a hard time reading statistics and struggle with any form of empathy. I saw a review here that read ""he divided a nation"" - sure. That right there tells you more than you need to know. Colin is an extremely talented player who wanted to do the right thing. A role model for many.",/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv

",It's really good. I came in with average expectations but Ava does it again. Introspective and insightful. Definitely worth a watch. And ignore the one star reviews. They're just trolls who are still hurt by his peaceful kneeling.,/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2021,daphparker,10," Uncomfortable Truth
","If this series made you uncomfortable then Kapernick did his job as a story teller. This was a well done, thought provoking series. There were some relatable situations that I myself went through. I laughed and I cried. Bravo to Ava Durvenay and Colin Kaepernick the Executive Producer's. I ignored all the uncomfortable critics. I believe it is in poor taste for critics to comment if they have zero experience being black in America. I look forward to seeing a part two.",/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,mgitts1977,9," Great series!
","This was wonderfully done, but it will definitely trigger some. Give it a chance, watch it with an open mind, and don't let the negative reviews dissuade you. It honestly shows what a lot of Americans/ppl think and act like towards others who are different due to their fear or ignorance-- which I'm sure has been witnessed by many. I'm sure as you read some of the reviews and see the ratings, the aforementioned ppl will show you who they are.",/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2021,kenyaekofi,10," Great work
","I loved this mini series. This mini series was amazing to watch with his experiences in this horrible country. Growing up adopted with two white parents who couldn't understand the experience of being black in America. He had to cut off his hair for his baseball team. Social racism, stereotyped by police, and many other experiences being related through racism. I myself have been stereotyped, and had social racism with other whites. Colin even still deals with racism in these reviews. The acting was good. The show was relatable. I was called ""one of the good ones"" as well. I had no idea what that mean't. I also loved the historical facts and comparisons with slavery and modern day sports. I feel the truth is the harsh reality is that life isn't made for you. Just do what you choose to do and block out the noise! I really appreciated this mini series! Thank you Netflix and thank you Colin! Black power.",/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,laserwiz77,10," Outstanding
","I felt that the production of this series was fine but compared to the man featured in it (Colin Kaepernick) it was a bit lacking. I'm pretty sure that there is nobody ON THE PLANET who had the ability to be drafted into the MLB, the NFL, play in the Probowl AND the Superbowl!! On top of that he holds a record for QB rushing yards that still holds AND he was 4.0 GPA athlete to boot!! In addition to that he is an activist for a worthy cause. When I heard that Nike picked him up as a spokesperson I bought their stock and am glad I did! Thanks to Netflix for providing yet another platform for this stellar individual.... Haters be damned!",/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,jodee143,10," Glad I watched and Really listened ‚≠ê
",Grateful for this opportunity to learn a plethora of black history in America. The information is interesting and interwoven throughout the story. There's just 6 episodes. From his early life as a kid. Good to know and understand more about the man. I would like to know more. Colin works with several charities and gives of his time. I want to know what he's up to now.,/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2021,loveswillow,10," This old white lady loved it!
","I'd heard of Colin Kaepernick for years, especially from President Trump, so I knew there was more to the story. Thank you Netflix for bravely producing this limited season. It was uncomfortable at times because I saw myself in the predjudice from the Caucasians. It stung, and rightly so. I gave it a 10 because it changed me! I was shocked at the 1 and 2 ratings. Did they even watch it? Actors were incredible, I'm recommending it to my family and friends.",/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,karrinna,10," Great
","Very honest, touching and insightful so that people who could not possibly understand where Colin is coming from, can get an idea of what lead him to the choices he made as a man and activist. Kneeling has nothing to do with disrespecting America or the flag. I am a combat veteran, also half white and black and even after coming back from Afghanistan, dealt with so many ignorance and prejudice! I'm good enough to fight for you but not good enough to not get pulled over and be profiled, this is not the America we want. Do better people. And stop rating stuff based off your prejudice when you didn't even watch it people.",/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,stuart-meagher,10," Great show
",Honestly most of the bad reviews are from haters and driven by personal politics. This is a great show and extremely enlightening. A must watch. Really enjoyed it. Fair play to Colin and he's actually better than I thought he would be as an actor or speaker.,/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,dave42c,," Moved Me to Tears
","In some ways, Colin had a privileged childhood with white parents. But in other ways, his loving but sometimes unwoke parents seemed occasionally (understandably) a bit clueless about racism, dark skin bias, racist micro-regressions, etc.",/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2021,lat297,9," Inspirational
",Let's get one thing straight from the start: when Colin took the knee it triggered the very worst of America as well as the very best. And that's what you'll see reflected in the reviews here on IMDB.,/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2021,litjeezy,10," Ignore the Negative reviews!
","Normally I don't leave reviews but I noticed all of the negative reviews for this movie! Since there are no marvel heroes, people want to go in with the intent of showing personal hate towards Colin Kaepernick! I feel like since this movie is about calling people automatically want to give it a low rating without actually watching it and trying to understand it. It's a must watch!",/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,gabni,10," Class is in session!
","This miniseries brings to light racist behavior Kaepernick experienced growing up and the impact it had on shaping his childhood, identity and ego. It's a revelation to some, a confirmation to others, and highlights many of the frustrations that blacks deal with living in America. It's a great production that should be enjoyed with family and friends.",/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2021,fallen_voice,8," Go in with an open mind
","Those who have complained about the story being told and how it's being told, are precisely the reason the story needs telling. This is just offering a different perspective to a world many of us couldn't possibly understand. Kaepernick isn't whining, he's just speaking his truth, and he's showing us there's more to pro-sports than we realize, and how naive we have really been.",/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2021,pammia-637-152524,10," Trust your power, lover your blackness, you know who you are
","Totally blown away by this autobiography of Colin Kaepernick. The low ratings only come from people that would never understand what being Black in America from the prospective of being adopted by white parents and living a life that typically ""only white"" boys would experience. From 1965 (school integration) to today I have experienced the same and similar experiences. Thank God that he was able to show his blackness in a white world that even in ""ratings"" are degrading and deprecating to a person who has achieved so much and represents the pinnacle of pride in race, pride in opposing injustice and pride in achievements. The 6 episodes were a treatise on a life that has truy OVERCOME. His journey to becoming a quarterback is awe inspiring and this story will become the JANE PITTMAN for the younger generation. The director and story writer were all A+.",/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,bettillee,10," Excellent, and highly recommended
","All of you haters need to back off! Once again, Ms. Duvernay shows why she is the queen of the movies! Every episode was fantastic, and as one reviewer said, those who are looking at it and say it's trash, are most likely white folks who are Trump supporters. They wouldn't and couldn't say anything good about a program that featured Black people, anymore than they could say something good about Colin Kapernick. They are so enamored of their whiteness that they cannot see a good program when they watch it. They can't see it because they are the perpetrators of the indignities that he endured. All Black people have experienced these scenarios. They are definitely not unique, and Colin relates them very well. We have all experienced these cracker moves. Colin is amazing; he narrates this program, makes you believe, and his parents, although their hearts were in the right place, were too obtuse to get it.",/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2021,kate_buckley,8," Enjoyable miniseries
",An interesting look at Colin's teenage years at high school and his struggle with racism whilst pursuing his dream of becoming a quarter back. I can see some of the themes bought up here have offended people but I personally didn't feel offended.,/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,murfwinship,9," Hater go away!
","Good, God! Why all the haters? Colin is a man amongst men, an officer and a gentleman, more American than most of us whiners and complainers.... Why on Earth, would people call this black man who works very hard I might add, a THUG? It is clear to me that the word THUG defines a criminal, low-life, con man that bilks money and resources off people, for their own ego and financial robbings. Hmmmm.....Does that remind us of anyone we know? (Orange Popsicle) This is a great show and explains how Colin grew up in American suburbia with a great deal of prejudice and unfair treatment. He excelled in every way, the American way, through hard work and effort. (He was no trust fund baby like the Trumps and many other spoiled people that belong to hate groups and hate organizations all over America. I think it's high time we expose these evil bastards, whose only purpose on earth is to heap terror and misery upon untold the masses. I highly recommend this show, as all American and wholesome to watch. Maybe we could all learn a thing or two. Pax and love, Murf.",/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2021,larmstr,9," Unique and interesting
",I can only assume the negative reviews were people who aren't comfortable with talking about race. This show is entertaining and thought provoking. A must watch for allies. I feel uncomfortable with the na√Øvety of his parents and friends. Lots of lessons to be learned.,/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2021,wilbertwwest,10," Very well done
","While I have not experienced everything that Colin experienced I have experienced enough similar situations that I do not doubt the authenticity of the series. Some episodes are better than others but, all are entertaining. I was already aware of most of the historical educational moments but, there were a few new facts that I learned.",/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2021,carlycroch,10," Ignore the trolls
","Ignore the trolls that refused to hear the message. Fantastic series, I laughed and cried. An honest look at how micro aggressions make a lasting impact. Colin's experiences and story can go a long way to healing the racial divide if people would listen to the message of this series rather than attempting to drown his voice. Having the perspective of different directors added a nice touch.",/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2021,djean-385-619019,9," Thank you Colin for making this
","When he knelt for the flag, I admit I was upset and ""thought that he was being too dramatic and annoying."" I've learned and grown from back then but there is still a ton I don't understand as a white man. What this show does is educate and make you understand a little more, and isn't that a step in the right direction towards equality? Please don't pay attention to the negative reviews by those that continue to refuse to be educated. Do yourself a favor and watch this show.",/review/rw7501296/?ref_=tt_urv
