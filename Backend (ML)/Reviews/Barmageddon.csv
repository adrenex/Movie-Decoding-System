","I'm european so maybe that's why i loved all the nasty humor but honestly i don't know what these people are talking about. this movie is a hidden gem. it's so freaking unique and original. the only thing i didn't like about this movie was how short it was!! it wasn't perfect but for a kiwi movie it was so much better than i expected. the acting from the two chicks was spot on. this isn't trying to win any oscars, it's just a ridiculous, hilarious movie to help you kill some time in a great way.",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2019,vicky-51523,8," edgy, dry, dark and ridiculous
","Funny NZ movie, don't be swayed by some poor reviews from people who likely prefer their humour served up American style rather than Antipodean, but I for one appreciate their edginess, no limits and ability to laugh at themselves very much indeed, I think its quality. This film doesnt come across low budget to me as some reviewers claim, I think its on point, well acted with laugh out loud bits in it. I love the fact the two main actors wrote, directed and starred in the film, which is about a business run by two friends who offer a service dumping peoples partners for them, the varied and extreme ways they go about it is at times too funny/shocking for words. Amongst many brilliant scenes there is a short but fab cameo near the beginning, a tinder date getting down to it played by the wonderful Jermaine Clement (What We Do in The Shadows, Men in Black 3). The whole film is edgy, dry, dark and ridiculous throughout - but not at all heavy. I thank the Lord above that we have such quality stuff coming from the other side of the world to lighten our northern hemispherical lives, Chris Lilley's Summer Heights High, No Activity, What We Do in The Shadows spring immediately to mind, and although this isn't quite the same caliber, it IS under the radar quality comedy and I can think of many worse ways to spend an hour and a half on a dark February evening in the UK.",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2018,DroogEditor,8," Laughed out loud watching alone
","This has not happened in a long time: I thought this was so funny, I laughed out loud several times. Even skipped back to rewatch perfect comedic timing.",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2019,theirishfox,7," No filter friendship
","I admit, I'm surprised it was a movie. I thought I had clicked on a TV series and was going to enjoy new break up scenarios every episode. So for me it was over too quickly and wrapped up too easily. But regardless, I had fun. I laughed, I cringed, I was entertained.",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2019,The_Mich_,6," definitely a laughing out loud situation
","Just a great funny, uplifting and easy movie. it doesnt ask you for much, it lets you relax and have a good time.
Dark and corky comedy at its best.
Good acting, lovable characters.
All the characters could have turned out to be played out so stupid or caricaturesque, but the actors do a great job.
Its certainly a 'lifter upperer'",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2019,AristarchosTheArchivist,7," Cute and quirky - not a masterpiece though
","I really enjoyed this kiwi movie, mostly for the really cute and quirky humour.",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2019,nickboldrini,6," Hit and miss comedy
","Genuinely laugh out loud moments in this, but as often with comedy, the story starts to get too serious and (to be honest less interesting) which detracts from the fun value of this film.",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2018,IceBlue2014,7," Funny, honest, Pacific chick-flick
","This is a beautifully made, very funny film about two women working out their sex and romantic lives in modern, multicultural Auckland. What I really like about it there is nothing mean-spirited in this film, it's very Kiwi, and the women are honest and hilarious - nothing vulgar about it. It's not an instant classic in the vein of Boy or Hunt for the Wilderpeople, but I think it will grow on me.",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2019,kylevespestad,10," Hilarious

17 February 2019,Gordon-11,," It's quite funny
",This film tells the story of two women who break relationships for a living.,/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2018,feardeathbywater,7," Entertaining... with a sometimes uncomfortable/awkward edge
","I honestly find it difficult to understand why this film has so many one star reviews! I enjoyed the silly and sometimes very uncomfortable humour, and thought there was a real warmth to the film. I'm hoping to see more from the two female leads in future.",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2018,Aktham_Tashtush,2," Don't ... just .. don't
","I just can't believe i sat through the whole thing !!
The plot is all over the place it really had potentials but the messed the whole thing up ,, the script got some few funny lines but it all look cheap and cheesy ,, Loved the accent though ,, that's gotta count for something :D",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2019,kmuck-20415,10," I laughed all the way through it.
","During one scene I laughed so hard I almost choked. You'll know the scene when you see, and you should see it.",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2019,taylorann1,10," The ""Broad City"" of NZ
","The movie is a celebration of friendship more so than a spotlight on their job description. Their jobs are a way to draw you in, but once you get past the outrageousness of the main and supporting characters and plot, you understand that romantic relationships can be just like friendships. I hope to see more from these ladies as this was probably their first movie. They can only get better.",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2019,sukkuladihjupur,10," Loved it!
","Watched it alone while everybody was asleep. Bad idea.
Laughed my ugliest squeak laughter the whole time. Woke everyone up. I didn't care though and kept watching.",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2018,jenbie,1," Only just managed to not walk out.
","This film managed to surprise me by just how puerile it was. But I was expecting to laugh at some point - well I didn't laugh, not once. This film was just...immature - perhaps designed to appeal to 13 year olds? As a NZer I am actually embarrassed that this could be seen as our 'sense of humour' and I certainly hope it didn't get funding but I'm sure it probably did. The first film I've actually wanted to walk out on for years. The only reason i didn't was I thought it might get better. It didn't.",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2019,rossmichael-75248,2," What did I just watch... thank god it was a short movie!
",Was this meant to be funny? If seemed very random and the characters seemed very irritating to be honest. Made no real sense ans the acting was poor. Why did Netflix purchase this film and why are there so many good reviews for this? Utter garbage really!,/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2019,maccas-56367,2," Disappointing, though I laughed
","Starts off with rapid fire laughs, before they dry up as the film struggles to find a comfortable rhythm and resemblance of a storyline.",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2019,sophia55,8," More comedies like this please!
","Thoroughly enjoyed this laugh out loud buddy comedy featuring incredibly well thought out female characters. Managed to be both over the top and completely relatable at the same time, which is not an easy feat. Hoping that the success of this movie leads the creators/directors/stars to make more hilarious movies!",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2018,amandagostomski,4," Messy Plot
","This film had an interesting concept, and it had a lot going for it, but it just turned out a pretty mediocre film. I think I chuckled once, but most of the time I was just waiting for the movie to get better. It movie mostly relied on vulgar and silly humor to make the audience laugh. The plot was all over the place, and it was poorly written. Not a movie to go spend your night watching.",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2022,GiraffeDoor,7," This is the point where I make a pun about not dumping this movie or something.
","Beginning during the peak of their career as the Breaker-Upperers, this too-real-to-be-real comedy wastes no time.",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2018,redmondgarmony,2," Wanted to love it - SO DISAPPOINTED
","Mildly amusing opening & first 8 minutes, downhill from there. Can't believe Taika Waititi & Jemaine Clement had their hands on it... surely they could have edited the script a bit?!? Doesn't know if it's a drama or a comedy and doesn't work as either. Who is the intended audience? Almost every sin of scriptwriting is included: multiple scenes didn't move the story along, cliché after cliché, tired old jokes made the cut. Good premise (outsourcing the blow of breaking up), poorly executed. What a pity :(",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2018,tim-anderson-18791,1," It's a waste of time and money!
","I would have given this movie no stars if I could, but 1 star is the lowest rating that IMDB gives. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Terrible story. Weak characters. Appalling acting. There is absolutely nothing humorous at all in this movie. I can't believe that anyone would waste time and energy to produce such a weak film. I was ready to walk out after about 30 minutes but endured a little more to try and justify the cost of my ticket. It's just absolute utter rubbish.",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2019,ysabelkid42,7," Ridiculous fun
","I enjoy a good girl-buddy movie, and this one's right up near the top of my list. It's certainly no American-style comedy, so keep that in mind if you're expecting a Hollywood romp. It may look low-budget because there aren't any big sets as such, just people's homes, a police station, and sports clubs, but that adds to the charm when coupled with the rapid-fire patter of the leads. Pretty much the only bit that rang a bit false for me was the strip scene - fun though it was, the complete lack of interest from the rest of the office was a touch unbelievable. Other than that, if you're looking for warm, if raucous, humour that doesn't involve bodily fluids, give this one a try. It certainly left me with a grin on my face.",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2018,beingmaggie,1," crude and vulgar
","Usually enjoy nz and aussie movies but this was sadly lacking a script so resorted to grossness and vulgarity to fill in. the storyline was all over the place the only consistant thing about it was how it managed to get back to gutter humour. the only good thing about this sad little movie was the actors trying to do something with this rubbish production ,dont waste your hard earned cash on this purile load of rubbish maybe if your age between 13 - 14 you may find it funny its a childrens movie without wit",/review/rw4154973/?ref_=tt_urv
