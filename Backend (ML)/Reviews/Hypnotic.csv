","I knew what this film would be about before I rented it, but I'm stunned that it would be THIS good. Nothing against ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Shakespeare in Love"", but this film should have won Best Picture in 1998 and it was a shame that it wasn't nominated. It's an even bigger injustice that it did not get a nomination for best screenplay or cinematography.",/review/rw2286049/?ref_=tt_urv

23 October 2006,Isaac5855,8," A brilliant and vastly underrated cinematic experience
","PLEASANTVILLE had to be one of the biggest surprises I've ever had at the movies. This superbly mounted and completely winning fantasy starred Toby Maguire and Reese Witherspoon as a contemporary teenage brother and sister who are magically transported into a black and white television show called ""Pleasantville"", a show similar to ""Leave it to Beaver"" or ""I Love Lucy"", where everyone in the town knows each other, where the fire department only saves cats from trees and never put out fires and where there are no pages in the books or toilets in the bathrooms. Maguire's character is a ""Pleasantville"" trivia expert so he knows everyone there and everything that's going to happen but sis Witherspoon is a stranger in a strange land whose introduction of 1990's sensibilities to the citizens of this town brings about extraordinary changes. The film is beautifully made with a very smart screenplay and superb performances, the best of which is by Joan Allen, who is luminous as Betty, the mother in the sitcom who is shocked at first but learns to accept the 1990's coming to Pleasantville. Yes, it may borrow from other movies, but there is a freshness and originality to this movie that is most engaging and anytime with Don Knotts is time well spent.",/review/rw2286049/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2003,adamw_13,10," floored
","Some critics here are saying the movie takes itself too seriously - but I believe some people are taking it too literally. ... Saying that the topics that are addressed have no impact on society anymore, clearly misses the point. ... The 50s -- or more specifically, 50s TV -- is used as a metaphor, because of the way 50s TV portrayed life in America. ... Thematically, this movie is about ""Living Life"" to the fullest, whatever that means. More specifically, to live life to the fullest -- to truly feel ""alive"" -- you need to take the good with the bad. Sweeping things under the rug and just acting ""pleasant"" all the time, is no way to live. That's what Tobey McGuire's speech at the end to his ""real"" mother is all about. Bad things happen, it's part of life. Having passion brings with it positives and negatives -- but suppressing true feelings for the sake of ""pleasantness"" is an empty life. THAT is the key ... and that ""issue"" is everlasting to the human condition. ",/review/rw2286049/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2009,CihanVercan,10," The Colors of Modern Life seems Brighter than ever before
","Three movies of the late '90s -The Truman Show, EdTv and Pleasantville- specifically examined how television made an impact on our world, our culture and our values. They both showed larger than life happenings and captured our minds with their perspectives. In EdTv there was a humble video store clerk guy having his life filmed for a reality show, which was happening in present time. Though in Truman Show very futurist and fantastically, Truman Burbank was not even aware that his life is being filmed, offering the viewer the vision of life from God's perspective. Distinctively here in Pleasantville, there is a journey which starts with materializing a TV-series into life and ends up with materializing the life into this TV-series.",/review/rw2286049/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2010,planktonrules,8," Don Knotts is magic...
","Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon play brother and sister who are high school students in the present day (though they were 23 and 22 when they made the film). While you have no idea WHY, Don Knotts (yes, Don Knotts!) plays a magical TV repairman who gives them a bizarre looking remote that somehow transports them into a TV show that Tobey loves--""Pleasantville"". They have no idea why this occurred or if it will ever end or if Knotts is god, but oddly neither questions this new world that is literally in black & white like an old episode of ""Father Knows Best"". However, unwittingly, their presence with their modern sensibilities and notions causes this seemingly idyllic world to start to slowly come apart at the seems. Notions such as freedom to choose, sex and individuality are missing in this world--and the two interlopers bring this to the plastic world of Pleasantville.",/review/rw2286049/?ref_=tt_urv

14 November 1998,Tetsel,," Positively Wonderful
","Pleasantville should be nominated for Best Director and Best Cinematography, and perhaps Best Supporting Actor for William H. Macy. Joan Allen, Jeff Daniels and Tobey Maguire are also excellent, and the idea is brilliant. In other words, this film is one of the best of the year. It is fun for the eyes and filled with wonderful allusions to great books and other films, not to mention some similar events in our country's past. If you will let yourself go from reality and put a little thought into it, you will realize the sheer genius behind this film. The messages were plenty and appropriate, and while it is extremely fun to watch, it still is able to evoke deeper emotions. Fantastic, and my vote for second best film of the year behind Saving Private Ryan.",/review/rw2286049/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2002,bob the moo,," Good tale on values and change that loses it's way occasionally and is quite slow
","When a mysterious TV repairman gives David a new remote control both he and his sister gets sucked into an old 50's show called Pleasantville.  A first all seems perfect in a cheesy 1950's way - all language is wholesome, everything is black and white, none of the sports team ever miss and nothing is unwholesome.  However when David and Jenifer begin to influence those around them they not only change attitudes and behaviour but start to bring colour to the town.  The town splits in it's attitude to this change.",/review/rw2286049/?ref_=tt_urv

My manager and I seem to go out to movies a lot after work.  It's odd how people who around film all day cling to it for relaxation at the end of the shift.

13 February 2000,gagliano,," First of all...I really liked it.
","First of all....I really liked it. Ignore any review (and reviewer) that says different. We live in a day and age that we seems like every movie has a touch of this old film and bit of that one...or is a remake or possibly a re-release. But Pleasantville is none of that...it is unique, fresh, reflective, pleasant (you knew I was going to use that word someplace), sad, but yet still had a touch of fun. The film begins by looking at the interaction between and the lives of a brother (Tobey Maguire) and sister (Reese Witherspoon). The brother is very content with his life and enjoys watching television, in particular, the show, Pleasantville. His sister, a bit more outgoing, enjoys meeting new people and seeing where this interaction will lead. A fight over which show to watch results in the intervention by Don Knotts (of Andy Griffith and Three's Company fame). Maguire and Witherspoon are wisked into the television set and take center stage as two of the Pleasantville cast. The only difference is while the world may be watching a tv show, to them, this is their reality. The film appears to be in black and white, but as each character opens their mind or changes from the perception of the Pleasantville tv show, then they begin to gain color. As those in color become more prevalent, the old black & whites become resistant to change. To ebb the flow of change, the black and whites react violently against the ""new colors"" and begin placing restrictions on them. Yes the similarities of the 60s civil rights movement are here as are the violent acts of the Nazis in pre-World War II. But while you see these, you are also brought to the realization that there still exists a great deal of prejudice, discrimination, and close-mindedness in this world. One of the most pleasing aspects of this film is the cinematography, the mixing of the colors with the black & white shots were great. The story keeps your interest and the characters impact upon each member of the audience in their own special way. This is one film to see for I think you will hear more about it around Oscar time. Bottom line...if we open our minds more towards others, letting them be who they are, rather than who we want them to be, then not only will we be richer in color, but also richer in character.",/review/rw2286049/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2010,KineticSeoul,8," Original fairy tale that kids and especially adults can enjoy
","I really liked this movie, not only is it pleasant it's original. The plot is about a brother and a sister, David and Jennifer going into the TV show literally, into one of those old sit-com where everything is black and white and everyone has a perfect family. And the people are living the same routine life while everything is black and white, but David and Jennifer starts changing that. The movie has a deep meaning about it, even on today's society and I enjoyed it from beginning to end. It was like watching a fairy tale for adults, I honestly don't know how anyone can dislike this film. Sure the second half isn't as good as the first half, but this is still really worth checking out.",/review/rw2286049/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2003,Cipher-J,," Where everything is always the same.
","The basic theme here being that the meaningful life requires breaking out of rigid, dull and conventional roles, this film's story sucks two teens back through their television set to a fictitious 1950s sitcom named ""Pleasantville,"" where life is in gray-tones until they start breaking the rules.  The self-referential notion of having characters interact with the very media which represents them has its counterpart as far back as 1924 with Buster Keaton in ""Sherlock Jr.,"" in 1970 with a low-budget film named ""The Projectionist,"" and in 1985 with Woody Allen's ""The Purple Rose of Cairo.""  But where the others explore the private experience of self-discovery through their enmeshment with the media, this one explores a much wider public awareness.  In that sense it is a very cleaver and intelligent story, offering numerous social messages worthy of consideration.",/review/rw2286049/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2016,sharky_55,8," Honey! I'm home.
","The key theme in Pleasantville is that you do not turn colour until you have truly been set free, until you have broken the shackles of your confinement and step out of your pre-defined mould (utopia as dystopia). On face value this seems a little confusing; after all Jennifer doesn't seem to do anything much than start reading and studying, somehow magically struck by the nerd gene and gaining her pigment and redemption. On a closer look, this seems to be linked to the cultural and artistic explosion that occurs in Pleasantville with their arrival - Mr Johnson's multicoloured murals, the books and their spontaneously appearing stories and illustrations, the rock-and-roll tracks that suddenly creep up onto the buttons of the jukebox.

It has touches of ""A Short Walk"" and ""A Stop in Willoughby"" in it. But Serling, brought up in Binghamton, New York, usually saw the past as something regrettably lost.

","I just rented Pleasantville and was very moved by it. If you're wondering whether to see it, please do. It's somewhat similar in feel to The Truman Show - a warm comedy that conveys social criticism. That's why I just rented them both for the first time and watched them back to back - and much preferred Pleasantville as more profound, funnier, and having more original writing.",/review/rw2286049/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2004,paul2001sw-1,5," Pleasant, but pernicious
","In 'The Wizard of Oz', Dorothy dreamt of an exciting life outside her native Kansas and was whisked into a colourful (and then revolutionary) fantasy world. In 'Pleasantville', this scenario is reversed: David (Tobey Maguire) dreams of (and then visits) the idealised world portrayed in a 1950s, black-and-white soap opera, in contrast to the ""exciting"" real world in which he is just a geek. His trendy sister, played by Reese Witherspoon, travels with him (though only under severe protest). The need of the characters to adapt to, and not to upset, the ""past"" has elements of 'Back to the Future' about it; while the contrast between the real world and a santised utopia, whose inhabitants know nothing different, resembles 'The Truman Show'. 'Pleasantville' is less obviously comic than either of these films, but it is beautifully executed and William H. Macy in particular seems perfect for his role as David's fictional father. Dramatically, however, it suffers from the fact that Maguire never manages to convince that he truly believes in the reality of his situation. And when films such as 'The Last Picture Show' and 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?' have addressed (with great subtlety) what is lost, and gained, when the values on which small town communities are based break down, it seems strange that 'Pleasantville' offers us only a pointless dichotomy between a world where everything is nice but dull, and another equally unreal world, where the pursuit of individual gratification always results in its acquisition. As a result, the film does little more than lazily peddle the standard Hollywood myth, that we can be anything we want if we believe it; a sad end for a work of some artistic distinction.",/review/rw2286049/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2010,RyanCShowers,," Exploding with Originality
","Pleasantville is one of the most original movies I've ever seen. It's entertaining from beginning to end and charms the life out of you. The script....I don't know where to begin with the script. It's so imaginative and heart-warming; it's just wonderful. Its containment of sexual curiosity and racial discrimination is absolutely excellent. They are two of the biggest themes here and they are done beautifully. The script is just magical. The visuals are stunning to say the least, the evolvement from color to black and white is masterful. The acting is terrific. MaGuire, Witherspoon, and Allen in particular deliver great performances. Overall, you must witness this film and everyone should be inspired by the amount of creativity piled here; 10.",/review/rw2286049/?ref_=tt_urv
