15 January 2004,the-evil-cult,10," Entertaining and Thought-Provoking.
","Of the 250+ films I've seen and rated on IMDb, only one other (Schindler's List) is as good as American Beauty. A film like this not only entertains while you're in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality. After watching this movie, viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them. The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can't really grasp.",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2000,RueMorgue,10," An Oscar well deserved.
","This film is one of a kind.  After seeing this film last week, I was left with a hole in the pit of my stomach.  It left many questions in my mind, and most of them cannot be answered. In my view, a film that makes me think after I watch it is second-to-none, and this film certainly delivers in that aspect.",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2001,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," An American Masterpiece
","This is by far one of the best, if not THE, movies of the 90's. ""American Beauty"" stole my vote immediately as I started watching it. The idea and concept of ""American Beauty"" is just some ordinary people on an ordinary block with ordinary lives.",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 1999,Rusty-61,," Could be the best movie of the year.
","And there were a lot of great ones this year. I will also say something even (possibly) bolder--that Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career. And all us movie geeks know that is saying a LOT, given this man's past roles, and his talent. I used to think he was overrated as an actor. Then I figured OK, I see what all the fuss is about. Now, he's up there with my favorite actors of all time, with James Woods, Steve Buscemi, Robert Deniro...probably in the top 5. ",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2000,SD-4,10," A deep, wonderful, penetrating film; extraordinary irony in a psychological drama about the American life.
","I have come to see the movie with a certain prejudice.  Everyone saying that it was so wonderful, so touching, so excited -- I usually tend to go with movies that nobody likes.  Nevertheless, this one was a certain exception.",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2000,ryan_lynch,10," A little masterpiece...
","""American Beauty"" is tour de force cinema. Sam Mendes' brilliant debut feature depicts a web of characters who yearn for their own 'American Dream' - yet, in the end, only one character truly attains it.",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2003,Philip_Pugh,10," Beautiful...
",Probably the best film of 1999. This dark comedy drama marks two fantastic feature film debuts with Alan Ball as writer and Sam Mendes as director (both winning oscars for their sterling efforts).,/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2007,uhmartinez-phd,10," Close To Perfection
","The intention is so clear that everything else falls into place, perfectly. Kevin Spacey's suburban husband and father reminded me of his character in ""The Ref"" and that could only be a good thing. Annette Bening and her giggle works wonders here. Their marriage is a tabloid version of a ""Who's Afraid To Virginia Woolf"" Which means very close to someone we know. The biggest surprises in the film. besides the amazing dexterity of Sam Mendes at his first outing behind the camera, are West Bentley. Chris Cooper, Thora Brch and Allison Janney. As I'm writing this 8 years after its first release, the Oscars and the whole hullabaloo, I'm very surprised that West Bentley hasn't become a major star. He is amazing in ""American Beauty"" the complexities of his character are based on recognizable human stands, the hardest to face up to and I went where he went. Thora Birch is lovely as the object of his attention and the film, I believe, is here to say.",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 1999,The Woof,10," One of my faves of the year...simply great.
","This movie was a joy to watch.  I didn't know what to expect when I came into it.  I had heard the buzz of the acting and the story, etc...but we've all heard that before and had been disappointed, but not so with this one.",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2001,reesew18,10," a very well done film that continues to amaze me...
","When I first saw this movie in theaters, I found it to be very funny. When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too un-ordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you've seen it, you know you've seen something.",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2016,Jared_Andrews,7," Delivers a beautiful, lasting message
","When I first watched American Beauty, I was in awe. To many, this feeling was mutual. I, like most viewers, felt as if I had just witnessed the ultimate achievement in cinemaâ€”a film that actually changed my life. I thought it was the deepest, most profound film ever. I believed the message. I was ready to appreciate all the beauty in the world.",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv

14 December 1999,bootsy-4,10," Far and away the best film of the year
","What can I say, except that this film really knocked me on my keaster.  I went in to the theater not knowing what to expect, but was pretty sure it would be worth the ticket price.  Boy was I happy when I left.  Not only was it worth the ticket, I paid to see this film two more times.  This film is virtually perfect.  The acting is superb, the story is magnificent, the narrative is brilliant, and the structure of the film is truly groundbreaking (absolutely loved the last 20 minutes).  What really surprised me about this film was how well the cinematography was done.  In a small, character driven film such as this, it is very unusual to have such great cinematography.  With this film, there is something interesting going on in every scene, not many films you can say that about.  In a year where first time directors have made some of the best films, Three Kings, Being John Malkovich, etc...  Sam Mendes seems to have out-done them all.  Though I have yet to see The Green Mile or Magnolia, I find it hard to believe that either film will out-shine American Beauty.  This film should easily win a substantial amount of the Oscars this year.  What's up with all the cirtics awards snubbing it so far?",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2004,Galina_movie_fan,10," My Favorite Film From the 90s
","American Beauty is a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" film, and you never know if it has more 'love it' or 'hate it' viewers. Personally, I love it -from the first sight, from the last sight, from the eternal sight. It is my favorite film of the 90s, one of my personal twenty favorites ever. I think that American Beauty is an instant classic, and it will stay that way as long as people watch movies.",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2007,Pulpthatsfiction,10," Look Closer...
","The first time I heard about this movie I thought it was this movie and about a man with cancer and then read a lot of good things about and then say some trailers and then I saw it. At first I did not like this movie but than say it again on T.V and then loved it ever since. This is one of the most original films I have ever seen. The performances are one of the best and more Oscars should have been handed out. The directing by Sam Mendes is superb and I'm glad that he won the Oscar. Alan Ball wrote one of the best screenplay and story's ever thought and there's a reason why he won the Oscar and most deserving. This is the Best of the 1990's and that decade had a lot of great movies came out( Goodfellas, L.A Confedintil, Pulp Fiction to name a few). This was the first movie that I saw that was perfect and I had to see it over and over so I can just uncover everything that was in this movie. This movie is in my top ten movies of all time and I'm glad that it's rank number 35 and that one of the reason why I joined this because it was the only website people respect my opinions and agreed with me. Keven Spacey gives his best performance and one of the best of time. Spacey brings a great performance for a really deep and is just a great character. Annette Bening does a great and for some reason missed the Oscar. Chris Copper does a great job and didn't get notice that much, also did Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari and thora Birch did a great job and should have more notice. Sam Mendes does a great directing job and is one the best film debut ever. This film was one the best ever made and should be seen by everyone hows looking for great movie or how just want have fun watching a movie.",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Mayn't be the most original movie I have seen, but it is still an outstanding movie
","I wasn't expecting to like American Beauty, but I did, loved it more like. The story mayn't be original at first glance, but how the film is written and constructed more than compensates you completely overlook. You may argue the characters are weird and unlikeable, maybe so, but they are quite complex. Lester is a self-described loser who is unwanted by everyone, Carolyn is uptight and sexually frustrated, Jane is the epitome of a sulky teenage daughter and Allison is like a incipient Lolita who Lester becomes smitten with. American Beauty is probably an example of a movie that you may need to see more than once to truly appreciate it, I was like that with Vertigo.",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2022,gsh999,10," Perfectly captures the dystopia of the USA at the turn of the millenia
","Greed and hate has destroyed the fabric of society in the USA and this film depicts a broken family that could be millions of families in suburban USA. I often think acting doesn't take much skill but movies like American Beauty help me appreciate truly fine acting. The film shows how one man finds redemption by breaking out of the cage his life had become. Despite a tragedy, the film ends on a positive note with the narration of the central character. One of my top 5 favorite movies. Congratulations to everyone who took part in the making of this movie.",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv

","I first saw this in theaters back in 1999.  I loved it.  I really really loved it.  I've seen it four or five times since, and each time, I like it less.  I just saw it again a couple of days ago, and I stopped it before it was over.  At that moment, I decided to sell my DVD.  It has now been excised from my DVD Collection, about which I have considerable pride.",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2003,dataconflossmoor,," Hang Ups For Breakfast!!!!
","Why don't we live in Westport!!, My wife is the one with the balls in the family, I have the hots for my daughter's friend, Some homophobic Neo-Nazi kissed me on the lips, I'll have an affair with a business mentor, I hate my parents because that's what everybody in suburbia does. This only begins to comprise the cacophony of quirks that this family expounds on!! A mid-life crisis occurs when the most exciting thing in your life is masturbation!! Let's nurture the psychotics!! Let's patronize the adolescents!! Let's make excuses and thoroughly believe them!! Cavalier changes are the perfect depiction of the phrase ""Too little too late!!!!"" A remote understanding of family and friends is just too much trouble, so let's just not bother!!! Did you know that dad got his brains blown out!! Oh well!! Nobody knows why!! Daughter and wife and company will eventually think of something else in the very near future....It is a fact that an obscenely mega mortgaged America is incredibly self centered...All these demented problems prevail in sweet suburbia!!! Suburbia is mainstream America, so are these hang ups!! These hang ups and so many more!!! Anybody else care to add to this list feel free to do so!!!",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2006,kenjha,6," American Ugly
","Much-praised film about a man facing mid-life crisis in suburbia, dreaming of playing Humbert Humbert to a Lolita that is his daughter's friend. There is only one word to describe this film: pretentious. Mendes thinks he is making the Great American Motion Picture but it is populated with cookie-cutter characters and it superficially touches on what the filmmakers regard as important themes. The acting is mediocre at best. Spacey gives the kind of performance that the Academy loves and awarded him with the Oscar but his acting here can be best described as mugging. Benning does not fare much better as his desperate wife.",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2015,BA_Harrison,10," For anyone who has ever wondered what the future might hold or questioned what could have been.
","Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), 42, has spent years trapped in an unhappy marriage and an unsatisfying job. His relationship with his teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is almost as strained as that with his career-driven realtor wife Carolyn (Annette Bening). When Lester becomes infatuated with his daughter's friend Angela (Mena Suvari), it marks the beginning of a severe mid-life crisis that sees him revisiting the carefree ways of his youth, but at a cost.",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2019,UniqueParticle,10," My 600th review on IMDb and such a perfect movie for it!
","Makes me smile at so many scenes, well deserving of the 5 Oscars! The writing and emotions are exquisitely powerful yet somber. I absolutely love Kevin Spacey despite his personal life troubles and Annette Benning blows me out of the water every time. I'm delighted to own such a piece of art on Blu-Ray; American Beauty has been among my top favorites for a very long time I'd say number 8. The Soundtrack is one of the greatest things ever, to me this film is like a perfect tapestry after using the paint brush and Sam Mendes created it so well! Hope my thoughts aren't to over the top I just very much enjoy this movie!",/review/rw5204179/?ref_=tt_urv
