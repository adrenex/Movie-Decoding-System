4 October 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Wasn't expecting to laugh as much as I did!
",I have to say that I really wasn't expecting to laugh as much as I did at this show. Wellington Paranormal is about a group of investigators in the capital of New Zealand as they track supernatural events. It's a simple show that knows how silly it is and leans in to some of their dumb jokes that makes it even fun funnier. You can tell the cast is having an absolute blast making it. The seasons only consist of 6 episodes per season and only run 20-25 min but it's perfect. It's a show that definitely pokes fun at itself and will have you laughing out loud several times per episode. This is definitely a hidden gem and I'm glad I gave it a chance.,/review/rw5503641/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2022,padawanmovies,7," Is a UFO still a UFO after its been identified?
",That's the type of humor this show offers! Which lead to Maaka telling Minogue to F off lol! I appreciate HBOMAX for showing this in the states. It's in the same realm as most of Clemente and Whatiti's humor. Minogue is a dopey character but all the characters play hilarious characters. If u have Hbomax WATCH IT!,/review/rw5503641/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2018,pontram,," Death Valley without the Gore but good humor
","In 2011 there was a shortlived mockumentary called ""Death Vally"", probably made by MTV, and probably cancelled because it was too grown up, too political incorrect, too violent. I liked it very much because of the firtst two qualities.
""Wellington"" clearly has a similiar concept, but is not violent.
On the contrary, the two main characters don't have guns but have to share one taser, though they are Police Officers in New Zealand's capital, which gives the show its name. During the first 4 episodes, there are no shots fired, no guns are waved, and nobody is beaten to death or mauled. I appreciate that.
As a mixture of many paranormal shows and comedy there are thematically mostly connections to the ""X-files"" (as announced in the signation music), and paranormal investigation shows, combined with a bit of Stan and Ollie, or Mr.Bean, if you want.
The humor is very dry, everybody takes himself or herself very serious., and jokes are always floating by in dialoguwe, so you can easily pick up one from the stream.
The main actors (they have partially the same names as their characters) are very talented and sympathetical, 
Production values, script, direction and cut are all very professional, despite one may think that there can not very much budget in it. You never miss anything, and sets are meticulously prepared.
For the humor, it is mentioned here that it's especially or even only working for New Zealand, but I can assure you, that's not the case. I had enough laughs and smiles to enjoy these episodes, and I am from the opposite side of the planet, and clearly not a native speaker. But I had to use english subtitles because of the fast dialoges, and sometimes i had to rewatch a scene.
However, for this very nice and carefully composed new series, I give 8 stas.",/review/rw5503641/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Ridiculous and Fun!
","Wellington Paranormal is so ridiculous and fun that I couldn't stop watching it. It's created by Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows, Thor: Ragnarok, Thor: Love and Thunder, Jojo Rabbit, etc) and Jermaine Clement so if you like their kind of humor then give this show a try. While it's not quite as good as What We Do in the Shadows, it's a spin-off of that show. It's a about a police force in New Zealand that start to see paranormal events in their city and start a Paranormal division led by Sergeant Maaka and Officers Minogue and O'Leary. It is a documentary style show in the form of Cops.",/review/rw5503641/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2022,dklecan,10," So stupid I can't stop laughing.
","What a great show to watch after July 4 activities. ....also go to Acorn and catch another lovable New Zealand entry, season 8 of Brokenwood Mysteries. It will be hard to beat watching Frodo and his extended family deal with an Egytian mummy.",/review/rw5503641/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2021,andrewpeel,9," Not since Police Squad
",Not since Police Squad which was criminally cancelled far to early have we had genuinely funny spoof police comedy like this. It's like a cross between Police Squad and spoof X Files delivered completely dead pan. Clearly those giving it low marks don't like sarcasm or dry humour - if that's not your thing then avoid but don't give it a 1 just because you don't like that kind of humour.,/review/rw5503641/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,S3pt3m63r,," Ghost central in Wellington!
","I love this show, I love WWDITS and this is a great spin off. The characters try to be solid police officer types but end up sending themselves up along with the rest of their colleagues and company. Poor Wellington real PD who I'm sure do a really great job, as these guys only seem to bungle their way round the most paranormal city in the world and get away with it. I like the cameos from the film and would have liked to have seen Stu, but never mind the series is great as it is with Nick and Anton making appearances.",/review/rw5503641/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show is so Good, just love it. Watch it. Wish the episodes were abit longer though. And more episodes per season. But the 2 main character's are so funny . Sarge Maaka is a blast to.",/review/rw5503641/?ref_=tt_urv

27 July 2022,msahippy,10," Literally LOL funny.
",I honestly don't know how the actors are able to play their parts with a straight face. Wondering how many takes they did in a day? I d have been fired for laughing and ruining the takes. Lol.,/review/rw5503641/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2021,selffamily,10," sooo funny
","I fell across this series purely by accident - reading that Americans need sub-titles to watch it - and have delighted it the humour, typical NZ writing, so very funny and unexpected. I can't wait to watch the movie that started it all. It's laugh-out-loud funny and gets me every time. Pure joy,",/review/rw5503641/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2019,robertemerald,9," Funny and charming
","Perfectly cast, great sense of timing, and childlike conceptions of responsibility ensure this show is genuinely funny. The effects are a mixed bag, but always somehow appropriate, and definitely a laugh. Though each episode has a theme, the writers are not averse to throwing in any number of other complicating scenarios. There's some surprising originality as well, despite the obvious thematic choices. Loved the theme music. The humour is not unlike Flight of the Conchords. This was definitely the highlight of my day!",/review/rw5503641/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2022,coles_notes,7," Good
","Created and written by Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi as the first spin-off of their film What We Do In The Shadows, this series follows officers Minogue (Mike Minogue) and O'Leary (Karen O'Leary) as they work for the new Wellington Paranormal division under their Sargeant Maaka (Maaka Pohatu) to take down ghosts, ghouls, werewolves, and zombies. Similar to the film that precedes it, Wellington Paranormal is shot in documentary style with a fake camera crew capturing all the footage and lots of talking heads before and after scenes explaining situations. It also has a lot of the same charms as Flight of the Conchords coming from Jemaine Clements unique humour. I laughed a good number of times, its stays fairly fresh over its four seasons. You don't have to watch the original film to get this, and the other spin-off series What We Do In The Shadows is fantastic, I think is my personal favourite from the group so far. Still Wellington Paranormal is quite funny, would recommend.",/review/rw5503641/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,lucylou3700,10," Absolutely hilarious!
","Some of these reviews are laughable, especially whoever called this show some sort of extra material from What We Do in the Shadows. IT'S THE SAME WRITERS/CREATORS YOU MORON!! This show is drily funny. The lack of reaction from the officers is what MAKES the show funny. It's just too intelligent for some of you, I guess.",/review/rw5503641/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2021,CreeCart,10," Cannot stop laughing !
","My dad, me, and my sister love this show ! We are not from New Zealand or Australia. We are from the United States in North America. I could watch this show over and over and over again! I told my sister about a movie called, ""What We Do in the Shadows"" and ""Interviews With Some Vampires"" which she loved. And one day she texted me about Wellington Paranormal! WooHoo! Thank you Jemaine Clement, Taika Waititi, Jonathan Brugh, Cori Gonzalez-Macuer, Stu Rutherford, Ben Fransham, Mike Minogue, Karen O'Leary, Maaka Pohatu, and everyone else involved for making us laugh. Thank you New Zealand!",/review/rw5503641/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2021,chrisrowexxx,10," Clever in a simple way
","To say this show is clever is strange but it's clever that it works so well but jokes so simple and obvious that it's just hilarious, Aussie and New Zealand humour for me is just the perfect level for good honest laughs, no two way political messages just good spoof fun.",/review/rw5503641/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2018,siobhandcole-30117,10," Pure kiwi fun
","Think Police 10/7 mixed with Buffy. It's hilariously funny and very much caters to the kiwi sense of humour.
The continual deadpan and kiwi ""inside jokes"" make this one of the best New Zealand original shows in a VERY long time. 
Short and sweet and doesn't take itself too seriously, definitely worth a watch.
Safer communities together.",/review/rw5503641/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2021,love2geek,10," Superb!
","Wellington Paranormal is simply hilarious! I love the film What we do in the Shadows so was very excited for this spin off series and it didn't disappoint...in fact, it exceeded my expectations! Not only is it laugh out loud funny, the two main police officers are brilliant! But I genuinely enjoyed the paranormal side of the epsiodes. It's got an xfiles feel to it but not as serious. I've only seen three epsiodes so far and I can't wait for the rest! What we do in the Shadows series was entertaining but Wellington Paranormal ups the stakes, (no pun intended) on the comedy and story telling. 10 of 10! Can't wait for more!",/review/rw5503641/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2021,drkwly,9," Unexpectedly Funny!

23 February 2020,altereggo123,10," Deadpan Humor Geniuses - Insanely Funny and Imaginative
","The writing is tight, the dialogue well-honed. The actors are amazing, never faltering in their incredibly serious silliness. This could have been gruesome and dumb, but the actors and writers have such a wonderfully light touch that I just smile thinking about each scene. It's all quite smart, heavy on absurdity and light on horror, though some of the special effects are impressively scary.",/review/rw5503641/?ref_=tt_urv
