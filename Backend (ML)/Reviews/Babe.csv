1 July 2021,ferguson-6,6," today's alternate universe
","Greetings again from the darkness. As far as I can tell, this is the first feature film based on an actual Twitter thread. Writer-director Janicza Bravo (LEMON, 2017) works with co-writers Jeremy O Harris and the real life Zola, A'Ziah King to mold the viral 148 Tweets (#TheStory) from 2015 into a somewhat coherent film that may just provide a bit more insight into the social media world than we'd prefer in one sitting. A24 movie studio proves yet again their original, creative, and unique films are unapologetically outside the industry norm ... and they are generating quite a loyal following because of it.",/review/rw7173526/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2021,paul-allaer,3," I don't get the hype over this movie...
","As ""Zola"" (2020 release; 86 min.) opens, Zola and Stephanie accidentally meet in a restaurant, and for reasons unclear and unknown, they strike up an immediate friendship. The next day, Stephanie invites Zola to come along on an impromptu trip to Florida, ""to go dancing"". Turns out that they are not alone, as Stephanie's boyfriend is along, as well as a guy whose role we don't understand at first... At this point we are 10 min. Into the film.",/review/rw7173526/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,Quinoa1984,8," I mean, you had me at Florida
","Zola is pure, uncut black market Florida. Like Sprinbreakers or Florida Project, it IS the state incarnate - or at least what's so endlessly scrollable about it). It's also a riotous funny dark comedy about how uncanny and gross the sex work world is (visa vi Backpage and so on), but also how black women always seem to have to come to the emotional and physical rescue of white women. And ironically as much as I love Paige and Keough's performances here (the latter sounding like she listened/watched a lot of Nikki Minaj's Anaconda song and or video, a fully sincere compliment), Braun - Greg from Succession, a true treasure at playing dumb and awkward, and Colman Domino's X (and his going between two accents just ::chefs kiss::) are stunning in their perfection of identifying an authenticity of these people. That's the key here: as wild as this gets, we always believe the people... at least as far as Zola's oh maybe 85-90% reliable narrator takes us.",/review/rw7173526/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2021,lareval,4," I just don't
","While the real story may has its go, the film wasn't interesting to me. It has a talented cast, excellent photography and some funny quotes. But I didn't enter in the game of the story, I never found it entertaining enough nor good enough. It's a well dressed misfire.",/review/rw7173526/?ref_=tt_urv

30 June 2021,bastille-852-731547,3," Bizarrely constructed dark comedy serving as a rare misfire from A24
","How do you make a movie about a truly ""stranger than fiction"" Twitter thread? Well, that's the task at hand for the creative team behind A24's ""Zola."" Being a fan of A24, I was hoping that this would turn out to be something interesting. Yet I was deeply shocked at how poor I found it to be. The film tells the story of Zola, a waitress in Detroit, who is enticed by a customer (Stefani) to go to Tampa, Florida for a weekend of stripping with the goal of trying to make as much money as possible. Oh, and Stefani's boyfriend (Derrick) and pimp (X) come along for the ride as well. Needless to say, things spiral more and more out of control. While the film takes an outrageous story that could be unique (in a shocking way) on the big screen, it is consistently unable to grip the viewer.",/review/rw7173526/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2021,FeastMode,1," ""based on the tweets by..."" wow
","I'm baffled. Astonished. Dumbfounded. Befuddled. At how it's possible that a full length movie was made based on a stripper's tweets. Even if the story was actually interesting, that would still be a shocking place to get a story for a movie.",/review/rw7173526/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2021,gortx,," Stripper Twitter War: The Movie
","Films have been based on one-line pitches. Brief synopses, and, perhaps most infamously a napkin (Jean Luc-Godard and Menahem Golan at Cannes for KING LEAR); therefore, a long series of tweets might seem like a encyclopedia by a comparison as the basis of ZOLA. Of course, it's not the length of the basic text that is crucial in turning it into a successful movie, but, how it's adapted.",/review/rw7173526/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2021,Xstal,8," Helluva Hoedown...

7 July 2021,JoBloTheMovieCritic,7," Zola
","7/10 - while I wasn't a fan of every artistic choice nor the lack of a strong ending (that brings to focus sex trafficking), this arthouse adaptation of the Twitter threads to end all Twitter threads is thoroughly entertaining and has a fantastic soundtrack/score.",/review/rw7173526/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2021,jfgibson73,5," Not the right fit for A24
","I was disappointed in this movie. I expected way too much, so that's my own fault. It follows two strippers on a road trip to Florida. It just felt like not a lot happened. They were on the right track, but they needed to make the story a little more exciting. I was okay with the characters and the performances, but nothing really stood out. Can not recommend.",/review/rw7173526/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2021,Megan_Shida,6," Heavy on the Style, Light on the Plot
","This movie is fun and the aesthetic choices were bold and always interesting. On top of that, the performances from the two leads were great and altogether believable. But what was the purpose of this film and what did it have to say? It goes at a break neck speed for 80 minutes and then just stops- there really is no pacing or story arc. Like the social media cycle it follows, we wont remember this story after very long.",/review/rw7173526/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2021,kevin_robbins,8," This is a well done movie that isn't a masterpiece but is worth a viewing
","Zola (2020) is a movie my fianc√©e and I watched in theatres yesterday. The movie tells the tale of two recent friends that decide to take a trip to Florida to strip and make a lot of money. Shortly after arriving it quickly becomes apparent that there was no intention to make money stripping but alternate plans to make money other ways that may put both of their lives in danger. This movie is directed by Janicza Bravo (Lemon) and stars Taylour Paige (White Boy Rick), Riley Keough (Mad Max), Nasir Rahim (Good Girls), Nelcie Souffrant (Strings Attached) and Nicholas Braun (The Perks of being a Wallflower). The storyline for this picture is very well told. I loved the feel of the movie and the perspectives of the narrator(s). The style which this was filmed fit the content perfectly. I also loved the dialogue being so fresh and current along with the social media tie in. The acting was magnificent as were the settings and costume selections. The conclusion could have been a hair better as it seemed a bit sudden, but overall this is a well done movie that isn't a masterpiece but is worth a viewing. I'd score this a solid 7.5/10.",/review/rw7173526/?ref_=tt_urv

","Yep. That's what I want to hear when I go to the theater... And endless parade of notification sounds. Nothing better. Seriously, where can I get the soundtrack to this? Just the notification sounds. I want to listen to them, over and over. Oh, yeah, and there's also this story, I think, about a very smart young woman getting sucked in, in about five seconds, by an incredibly stupid woman, and all the garbage people they meet along the way. But, hey, there's plenty of notification sounds to keep the story going. I walked out, halfway through. Nothing to see here but pretentious garbage.",/review/rw7173526/?ref_=tt_urv

5 July 2021,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,9," @Zola: A Crazy, Hoe-Trip
","Typically, movies are adapted from novels, plays and even news articles, but can a Twitter thread really be developed into a compelling film? When the story is as outrageous as the tweetstorm that A'Ziah ""Zola"" King posted about 5 years ago, then it is worth an try. Recently released in theaters, Zola is the successful adaptation by Janicza Bravo and Jeremy O. Harris of that infamous Twitter thread. Bravo directs the film and co-wrote the screenplay with Harris and infused it with all the suspense and humor that King's original tweets had while adding in some social commentary. Here's how it goes.",/review/rw7173526/?ref_=tt_urv

","I read the twitter thread this movie is based on and omg, it was a wild ride indeed! I was excited to watch how the movie would play out and it did not dissapoint (well almost!). The girls are absolutely beautiful and they know how to sell sex. Their sass and each tick for each character gives so much life to a story which came from tweets! I would suggest reading the tweets and then going for the movie, so you are not hugely disappointed that it wasn't 'more'. I think this was a very good concept of adaptation and I was enjoying the chaotic, awkward energy full on.",/review/rw7173526/?ref_=tt_urv
