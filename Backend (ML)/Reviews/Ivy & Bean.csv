5 March 2013,ascheland,6," Porn Doc Doesn't Fully Penetrate its Subjects
","Changing careers is never easy, but it's even harder when your previous job includes starring in movies with titles like ""Sorority Sex Kittens 3"" and ""Backstage Sluts,"" and doing anal is listed as a special skill. Bryce Wagoner's documentary, ""After Porn Ends,"" interviews a variety of ex-porn stars to find out how they transitioned from adult video stardom to more mainstream lives. Real estate seems to be the preferred profession for a lot of them, though none of the women who went into that field—Houston, Raylene, Amber Lynn—stayed in it. Asia Carrera became a stay-at-home mom, while Crissy Moran and Shelley Lubben became born-again-Christians, renouncing their porn pasts. Self-employment is the easier path to building a life outside of porn: Randy West became a semi-pro golfer; the late John Leslie was a musician and painter (a pretty good one, too); and, perhaps the most interesting career switch, Tyffany Million (a.k.a. Sandra Margot) became a P.I. and bounty hunter. Seka is self-employed, but earns money from her website, capitalizing on her porn fame. Mary Carey used her porn notoriety to get some D-list recognition on reality shows and a couple publicity-grabbing runs for governor of California.",/review/rw4997805/?ref_=tt_urv

","Quite an interesting documentary film. I noticed it as a ""new addition"" to the Netflix streaming movies and watched it that way. One of those interviewed in the film is an agent in the porn film industry, and it is he who says ""X is forever."" ",/review/rw4997805/?ref_=tt_urv

24 June 2021,jboothmillard,5," After Porn Ends
","Let's be honest, most of us (blokes especially) have watched or been curious about pornography at least once (or many times). I remember seeing this documentary film, or one or two of its sequels, listed on Netflix, and I was interested to watch it, especially seeing adult stars I may recognise. Basically, the film explores what happens to the actresses and actors who have been in the adult industry, how and why they got into it, their experiences after leaving the industry, and whether it is possible to live a normal life following their exposure (fame, being nude, having sex onscreen, and everything else). Interviewed and sharing their experiences before, during and after being in porn are: Amber Lynn, Asia Carrera, Bobby Slayton, Crissy Moran, Houston, Mary Carey, Nina Hartley, Randy West, Raylene, Seka and Tyffany Million. Most of the stars left the industry to concentrate on a marriage or having children, turning to religion or politics (especially campaigning about the negative aspects of the industry), or just wanting to find themselves and do other things. All the stars talk about the positive aspects of the industry, from the fame (hanging out with other adult stars and celebrities), the fortune, and the experiences (sexual or not), including the changes that came in each decade (from softcore to hardcore magazines, cinema screenings, home video, the internet, and attitudes towards body types, ethnicities, tattoos, etc). They are also open about the negative things that come with being in pornography, including negative press, troubles with personal and public relationships, friendships, health problems, finding other employment, and knowing that whatever they do next, they cannot fully escape their past. You may be fascinated if you recognise the former adult stars talking about themselves, and even if you don't, this is a part of the multi-million business that perhaps not thought of as much, and it makes for some interesting stories. There are obviously parts of the film that will cause distress when they discuss the bad things that can happen going into an industry built around being naked and having sex onscreen, but it gives you a good insight into the people behind the flesh you have seen on video and on the internet, a reasonable documentary. Worth watching!",/review/rw4997805/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2012,marys1000,6," Interesting subject but could have been better
","I found the topic interesting and think it was great that someone finally did a somewhat better job at the topic. It was very passive voice, no questions were asked, there were no interviews, just subjects talking, telling the story. Which was very humanizing but not as informative. I wonder why all the men subjects had been out of porn for so long. Surely there are younger men who have left porn. The industry has changed a lot. Thought their experiences weren't quite as relevant. Of course the bottom line is.....can you ever get a handle on how porn performers really feel about what they do or did? Would they tell the whole truth even if they could?",/review/rw4997805/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2014,andrebortolon,7," Interesting
","I think 'After Porn Ends' brings to light a prudent question: what those who make their living in the porn business do after... after... they finish it? Well, the movie tells us that not everybody in this field really stops for good; even the actresses, who are most requested in their early twenties or so, they can continue working in parallel or do something-porn-related when they get older. The main thing, according to the film, is that these people live in their own world when they are into this. The parties, the drugs, the trips, they're all consequences of this chosen life. You might raise the question: 'But why did they choose this kind of life?' a psychologist says that most of them see this as an only opportunity to be somebody, somehow; to escape from their own lives, usually a life of struggles, with financial difficulties; not to mention that some of them (I guess a small part, since the movie didn't delve into that much) were molested by parents or adults when kids. It's interesting to see some ex-porn stars doing something far different now. What seems they cannot run away is from being, to some extent, judged by other people in a moment somebody finds out on the Internet that this very person used to make a living by sucking a bunch of cocks, for example. I don't know,but those who left this industry behind seem to resent that they were part of it someday. The feeling is normally of shame and what's worse, they didn't get rich as they guessed. The film does a good job showing these people expressing their opinions. I just thought that it could go further on the psychological analysis - the psychologist speaks for less than a minute or two in the whole movie, while some ex-stars don't have, let's say, something too enlightening to say.",/review/rw4997805/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2013,awebster118,7," Immensely entertaining, based on true story!
","Over a dozen adult entertainment industry titans are interviewed for the documentary, including Asia Carrera, Nina Hartley, Mary Carey, Houston, Randy West, John Leslie, Amber Lynn, and Seka. If you're looking for something celebratory of the adult entertainment industry, go elsewhere. Dark and gritty at times, it's far from the most flattering look at the industry.

15 June 2014,ironhorse_iv,5," Like a messy money shot, this documentary was all over the place.
","I have a love/hate relationship with the sex industry. I really don't get how screwing for money on video is legal, while screwing for money is illegal. It's very hypocrite type society law. It's weird that pornstar are sub-culture celebrities and prostitutes & johns are ostracized criminals in the US. In a country that support freedom, it's very weird in its limited in the definitions of those sexual freedoms. I think it's a man or woman right if she wants to get into the sex industry. Still, I don't think it's should be celebrated or people should be punish for it. Indeed, sex is healthy for adults, but too much sex or lack of it, isn't good for you. I really don't like the sex industry; when people are forced to join the sex industry against their will, acts upon violence, misandry & misogyny attitudes, careless of diseases, or target children. I just can't bared to watch it. Like it or not pornography is still a billion dollar industry. Sex sells. Like other modern media entertaining industry, it's slowly dying due to piracy and over market saturation. Its reasons like this, why a great deal of ex-pornstars at leaving the industry. Directed by Bryce Wagoner, the movie showcase a number of ex-pornstars after their own climax. Like any other type of work, retiring has its ups and downs. For these porn-stars, most of them, had a horrible job of adapting to life after porn due to the stigma of being the porn-industry. After all, it's rare that pornstar would be taken seriously in a serious job field. This is why no one looks seem acting in pornography as a legitimate career choice to put on a resume. While others, just cause their lives to get worst, by getting into drug or alcohol problem. If anything is to blame, it's their bad judgment and falling into vices. Yes, some of them were taking advantage of, but for the most of them. It was their call to go into it. There is few found any sense of success. The movie is not out to preach in either its favor or condemnation of having a porn industry, but it does tend to sway on focusing on the dark side of porn. The stories we hear varied from way depressing to watch, to just curiously. None of them were really that fun to hear talking. The only one that seem interesting was the pornstar that turn into a bounty hunter. The others interviewers lives are just too gloomy, mediocre, annoying or mundane. For a movie, that is supposed to be a movie after porn. They talk a great depth about how they got into porn, and what they did. The film-makers even need to overlay the audio from the interviews with some nude footage during the subjects' careers as if its fanfare so people wouldn't get bored. It's hard to take what they are saying about what they currently doing seriously, when the nude footage like the Houston 500 world-record breaking gangbang featuring 500 men making you spaced out when one of them are talking about her life with cancer. Are we really supposed to take the women that went to political activists or found God seriously after watching footage of her past fooling around? It's really hard to. Some of the footage seems really out of place, and the camera-work was lousy at times. Overall: Most of the interview felt like underdeveloped disorganized stories. It even dragged at times. Had the movie focused on, one direction, maybe the film could had work. Honestly, the movie does have a good compelling personal story if only it really dig deep and ask the tough questions. You really don't see that. The movie really needed a narrative. Some sense of storytelling with merit. Something to get us from point A to point B. It should be something like 2008's MTV documentary True Life: I'm addicted to porn about Jayden James or 2005's Inside Deep Throat about Linda Lovelace. Truly, indeed this is not a movie you could watch with your kids or parents. I was deeply surprised how much they didn't focus on. Like gay ex pornstars. Honestly, this movie would had at less, have one interview with one of them. Another one is more ethic ex- pornstars! I would had love to see how a black person or Hispanic is dealing with leaving porn. The movie could had also feature, life as an ex-pornstar while living in other countries. There are countless ex-pornstars in Italy, and Japan, alone. It would nice to see how strict, or sexual freedom, the politics are in those countries. The movie didn't even mention some of the biggest stars that the industry had. No mention of John Holmes, Traci Lords, Jenna Jameson, Linda Lovelace, Ron Jeremy and others was a letdown. In my opinion, the movie could had been told better.",/review/rw4997805/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2014,estreet-eva,5," Hey, aren't you? I didn't recognize you with pants on
","Before we start, a quick nit - why the ""Ends"" in the title, it doesn't add any understand-ability and it sounds more dramatic without it. Anyway, the documentary which covers precisely the material as advertised could easily have been a NPR ""Frontline"" installment except for the spliced in footage of the subjects' past lives. Kudos to Bryce Wagoner for using that footage both sparingly and as archival material rather than wallowing in it to raise the titillation factor of the film. Also kudos for a balanced presentation between ""actors"" who suffered from their prior involvement with those who profited from it and those for whom it was just something they did for a living in the past like selling insurance or bookkeeping. Of course, this does take some of heat out of the proceedings and the film does allow the audience's minds to wonder on several occasions particularly during extended interviews. Also, the subject is limited: of course, most former stars will go on to some of a normal life while others will hang on to the industry given a lack of other employment options. In short, a tidy but limited documentary.",/review/rw4997805/?ref_=tt_urv

Dr. Malamuth shared some facts of what little air time he had. Ford, the writer, explained them as broken and turbulent souls twisting and turning. I didn't find them to be all broken.

Nina Hartley, who should have been the centre of this documentary, hardly gets a word in, while the anti-porn crusaders Shelley Lubben and Crissy Moran together cover approximately a third of this ""documentary"".
