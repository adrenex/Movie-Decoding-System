19 December 2010,classicsoncall,7," ""If I were you, I would think about climbing aboard"".
","Gee, if you're going to be a Scrooge, there's no point to even watching this movie. I read the negative postings on every film I see, and it's amazing to me how much energy people put into picking apart what's intended to be a holiday entertainment. Especially these days with the advance in computer generated effects. There used to be a time when clay-mation was the rage, and how realistic was that? How about considering the message - I for one would be darned upset if there was no more magic left in the world. It's evident every time my little two year old granddaughter runs in the room and tells her gaga (that would be me), to 'sit' so we could play or watch a movie like this together. This one got around to showing 'Santy', and you have to marvel when a mere child sits enthralled by the spectacle of color and motion the way it's presented here. For a while during my adult life, there was probably a time when I didn't hear that bell, but as I get older the sound is coming back, even as my hearing diminishes. I guess you'd call it the magic of kids and Christmas together, and you can count me in when the conductor calls 'All Aboard'.",/review/rw0987572/?ref_=tt_urv

","On the one hand there are many delightful moments in THE POLAR EXPRESS, not the least of which is the entire look of the film--appealing in a way that great illustrations of children's books always are to young and old. Tom Hanks and the others enter into the spirit of the whole thing with gusto--and all the performances are right on target.",/review/rw0987572/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have to say that I adored 'The Polar Express'. It was just the sort of film I needed to truly get me into the Christmas mood. The story revolves around a young boy, who is coming to an age where he is doubting Santa Claus' existence, until the Polar Express- a magical train destined for the North Pole- takes him and a group of other young children on a journey to Santa and to reaffirm their faith in Christmas.",/review/rw0987572/?ref_=tt_urv

","So it was with much trepidation and even utter fear in my heart that I went to see this movie. After all, the last time I went to see a full-length adaptation of a favorite Christmas story, what I got was Ron Howard's absolutely God-awful ""The Grinch"". Having grown up with the book ""The Polar Express"" (according to my mom, I cited it as my favorite Christmas present when I was seven), I did not want to see this story bastardized in any way. Honestly, I was prepared for ""Polar Express"" to be a complete wreck. But insteadÂ… ",/review/rw0987572/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2007,Sylviastel,10," Classic Christmas Film!
","Chris Van Allsburg best selling children's book is considered by many to be classic children's literature. The film version is an animated which benefits the story further. Tom Hanks plays the narrator, producer, and the train conductor. The animation is first rate, award winning, and breathtakingly realistic as well. Of course, this is a children's story and there are some dark moments like the girl who didn't have her ticket and the main character who found it and planned to return it to her so she doesn't get kicked off the train and the ending. Of course, I am surprised that there was negative criticism. If I had children, I would love a classic film like this about the true meaning of Christmas. The act of being the giver and the receiver is what the story is about. Let's not talk about the nativity, that's for another story. If It's good enough for Chris Van Allsburg, it's good enough for me.",/review/rw0987572/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2004,majikstl,," The eyes don't have it...
","There is a fleeting moment in THE POLAR EXPRESS where the title vehicle passes a department store with an elaborate Christmas display in the window. Everyone is excited by the sight, especially the story's protagonist, ""Hero Boy,"" until he sees the mechanical gears that reveal the display's Santa Claus to be a machine. That's the problem with THE POLAR EXPRESS, it is a splendid, wildly inventive machine, but it keeps on reminding us that it, quite literally, lacks a human face. ",/review/rw0987572/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2014,moviemattb,10," A Wonderful Experience
","I think this movie deserves a higher rating than a 6.6 on IMDb. I know its just an opinion to everyone else, but I just don't think it deserves to be ignored because ""The Polar Express"" is one of the greatest experience that I have ever seen, since when it first came out back in 2004 in IMAX 3D. My favorite part in IMAX 3D is where the train starts to go too fast, and we get this awesome experience that you are on a roller coaster ride. I felt like that I was part of that ride, and it was like ""WOW!"" Of course, I am only watching this in 2D which is fine but it will never be the same experience as what the IMAX 3D did. So, with that said, ""The Polar Express"" is about a boy who doesn't believe as he gets on a magical train known as the Polar Express as it leads up to the North Pole so he and the rest of the children are about to go see Santa Claus on Christmas Eve late at night. I don't know if the movie has a message but if it does, then I thought it is well done as we should know that seeing is believing as it for us on what we believe. The animation in this movie is spectacular, and I thought the animators did a great job on rendering these characters to make them look real. Of course, you can argue about on why Robert Zemeckis should have just shot this movie in live action instead of animating it. So, what do I know because I honestly don't know; maybe it is just for that kind of style as they are trying to make these characters to be more faithful to the book. Anyway, I thought Zemeckis does a great job on making this movie, and making this a whole lot of fun. Tom Hanks does a wonderful job to work with motion capture as he is playing each character that he is doing; it is also kind of hard on which actor or actress is voicing these characters or doing motion capture but I will leave that up to you. Nevertheless, Hanks was really good in it. The music by Alan Silvestri is very well scored, and the songs that he teamed up with Glen Ballard are pretty good too. I also don't mind if the filmmakers had to add new scenes that have nothing to do with the book, because folks, the book is short so that is probably why they had to expand the book into a movie that is over an hour an a half long. I was fine with it, and have nothing to complain about. So, enough talking about who or what is having problems with this movie, I just thought ""The Polar Express"" is a wonderful experience and would love if this was brought back into theaters, as well as showing it in IMAX 3D. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",/review/rw0987572/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2021,fernandoschiavi,7," It is a very beautiful and careful film with its theme, even if the story could have denser characters and conflicts to make the experience even more unforgettable
","Directed by veteran Robert Zemeckis, It is a production that unveils, throughout its 100 minutes, the story of an American boy in the late 1950s. By witnessing the polar express stop at his door, the young man will have the most fantastic experience of his life. Life, something that will mark him forever and allow his belief in Christmas, not as firm as one would expect for a child, to become even more solid. Initially reticent, the young man agrees to leave on the train that takes him on a tour full of incredible adventures. Each piece of territory crossed is a different learning experience, marked by its still incipient trajectory. He fights with Scrooge, the famous evil Christmas spirit, immortalized by the literature of Charles Dickens, passes by the famous Polar Aurora, a place with the optical phenomenon due to the brightness observed in the night skies of the polar regions, due to the impact of particles of solar wind with the high atmosphere of the earth, channeled by the magnetic field of our planet, that is, an impressive visual spectacle that leaves no one indifferent.",/review/rw0987572/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2012,ma-cortes,7," One Christmas Eve a group of kids aboard a mystery train that's headed to the North Pole

","The Polar Express is a rare exercise in pure cinemagic, where everything is dreamlike and exists in a world run on the motor of whimsy. It's a beautiful looking film, with every shot so mindbogglingly detailed and every action sequence so paralyzing in its charm and excitement.

29 November 2004,jaqued,," For Goodness Sake
","Clearly the reviewers who panned this wonderful film can no longer hear the ringing of the silver bell. I am reminded of the know it all kid in the film when I read these reviews. Some said it was too dark. Too dark? It was set at 5 minuets to midnight.....As I recall its dark then. Another called it ghostly; a condition true of a Christmas Carol, the film is in good company there. While I will admit that the computer motion capture in facial expressions is not as strong as it could be it did not detract from the story. Some reviewers did not like the roller-coaster effects. One even pointed out that trains can not do what this one does.....It's a dream...physics don't count. It is a sad commentary that the meaning of Christmas and belief in it's historically documented magic is so lost on those with access to the press. My review...it's good and it is best if you make up your own mind. I could hear the bell ring and I hope you can too.",/review/rw0987572/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Polar Express is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific voice cast.This and Elf are one of the most recent films that I consider a Christmas classic and happily watch every December,it is beautifully directed and the animation is absolutely stunning,there's s lovely Christmsd feeling all the way through.Tom Hanks was terrific in this film and I didn't even know he voiced so many characters ,particularily Santa Claus and the Hobo,they didn't sound a bit like him,but the Conductor was without a doubt my favourite.I do think this movie would have looked a lot better if it was live action,all the sets could have been amazing and I will admit that Robert Zemeckis's animation style is a little creepy because it's so close to real,but I will accept the way he chose to make it as it still looks great and he is my favourite director.I would highly recommend Polar Express for the whole family to watch at Christmas time.

15 December 2004,steve49er,10," Best Christmas movie ever made
","It was astonishing to read the lead in review. The complaint laid forth by the critic that the director's view of the North Pole and Santa's workshop did not reflect his, too bad. Maybe the critic could do better but it's doubtful. As for the line that the Elven town looked like something out of a German city, so what? Didn't many of the concepts of Christmas begin in Germany? My family (two seniors, a twenty year old father, his 3, almost 4, year old son) loved it. The colors were brilliant. The number of elves dancing, singing, and rushing to create an entrance for Santa was outstanding. Santa, himself, proved to be exactly as he should. Intelligent, sturdy, and kind. His reindeer, just as impressive. Forgetting the North Pole and remarking on the rest of the movie, how well done! The artwork, just great. The excitement, our grandson was out of his chair and standing while holding onto the chair-back of the row in front of us. There were scenes that could have seemed somewhat scary for a youngster, he didn't find them so. He laughed several times out loud, had his eyes glued to the screen when something serious seemed to be happening, loved the entire movie. He wants the DVD for Christmas (he will have to wait a year). He also told us that he wants to see the movie once more before Christmas. Out of the mouth of a three year old, his favorite movie.",/review/rw0987572/?ref_=tt_urv

15 November 2009,TheLittleSongbird,7," Phenomenal visuals, shame about the story...
","Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie very much. It is nice to watch around Christmas time. The film respects the book of the same name, which I think is a great one. Actually it was one of my favourites, a timeless Christmas story about the power of belief, faith and hope. Back to the film, one thing that was a definite plus was the visuals. They were phenomenal, colourful and looked as though the animators had gone to extreme lengths to make it neat. The character animation was just as impressive. The music is very good, with sparkling motifs and haunting secondary themes. The end credits song is truly beautiful. Another plus was the voice cast, Tom Hanks stands out obviously. He voices five or six characters here, and he was great as always. However, the film does take a while to get going, and the script is rather simplistic. And while the visuals were outstanding, the story while respectfully true to the book(while adding characters and changing existing ones) just isn't compelling enough, and is made up of disconnected,unexplained and sometimes rushed scenes in terms of story telling. All in all, a nice Christmas film that is well worth watching chiefly for the visuals. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw0987572/?ref_=tt_urv
