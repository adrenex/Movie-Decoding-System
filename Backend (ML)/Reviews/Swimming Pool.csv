18 December 2006,bob the moo,," Fitfully interesting but lacks a strong point and doesn't hang together all that well
","Flipper Purify is a successful architect with a beautiful wife and a smart young daughter back at his apartment. When he gets a new temp in to work alongside him he is not pleased that she is white but her hard work impresses him. Working late one night, chatting becomes a connection which becomes flirting which becomes sex. Their affair continues even as Flipper quits his job to branch out alone. However his life is thrown into chaos when his wife Drew finds out.",/review/rw5285587/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2006,Quinoa1984,8," one of those cases where the acting and direction (most of the time) is better than the script
","Spike Lee's films are consistent in one respect, even for the lesser ones, which is that they're always pressing buttons. In the case of Jungle Fever, it's another work where messages come out more than from a guy on a postal route. But that's perhaps part of the point, where such points come in many forms and sometimes like a barrage. This time, it doesn't completely gel as well as Lee's Do the Right Thing, which also held anger, contemplation, humor, and pathos about city life. But this time it's also a tale of sexual morays, where both white and black sides have their share of racism and prejudices, and at the core is a story of outcasts. The interesting thing then about Jungle Fever is how Lee's own decisions in casting and in the unique way he shoots his subjects and implements a subjective take more often then not trump what comes out in his script. Then again, maybe it's close to being inevitable with how the elements mix, and at the end there are some parts of the film that are the best that Lee's done so far as a filmmaker.",/review/rw5285587/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2006,lee_eisenberg,8," This was the era when Spike Lee got as good as he ever got.
","Spike Lee made ""Jungle Fever"" in the era when he also made masterpieces like ""Do the Right Thing"" and ""Malcolm X"". I will admit that the subject matter here is nothing that we haven't seen many times (an interracial love story), but Lee knows how to do without getting idiotic or manipulating emotions. In this case, African-American Flipper Purify (Wesley Snipes) has an affair with Italian-American co-worker Angela Tucci (Annabella Sciorra), thereby setting off a racially charged chain reaction.",/review/rw5285587/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2005,sol-,6," My brief review of the film
","With some interesting ideas about racism, some creative camera-work, and generally solid acting, there is enough in this film to make it worth checking out, albeit not enough to make it a great film. Spike Lee's depiction of a modern society build about racism lacks credibility, as it is hard to believe that the only thing the characters care about is racism-related. Lee's colour scheme hurts the film too, as the hues, in particular the oranges, are very harsh on the eyes, this distracting one from the on screen action. There are also some drug addiction subplots fitted in, to no certain advantage, and despite Terence Blanchard providing a nice multi-style score, it is used rather awkwardly throughout. Plus, there one large unanswered question: is Lee endorsing segregation and racism in the film? Believe it or not, in spite of these problems, the film has enough in it for adequate viewing. Seeing Halle Berry in her first big screen appearance is quite interesting, and Queen Latifah makes her debut appearance too as a waitress. It is very well shot, competently acted and it provides some things to think about, even if it is not too great overall stuff.",/review/rw5285587/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2011,ElMaruecan82,9," United Colors of America ...
","Spike Lee's ""Jungle Fever"" is an eye-opening introspection into the limits of that so-called melting pot sold by America as the epitome of tolerance and universalism... yet contradicted by the statistics and all the racial tension that prevailed in the early 90's. As a social commentary, the movie raises many important issues about interracial relationships in a less politically lauded tone than the iconic ""Do The Right Thing"", which is a wise choice for a movie mostly centered on human relationships.",/review/rw5285587/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2008,johnnyboyz,8," Really interesting and epic tale that deals with a sensitive subject but maintains other aesthetical qualities.
","Lots of hate and not much love is the feeling I get when looking this film up; ironic then that the idea of interracial relationships in 1990s America has much the same stance on the idea Â– stick to what you know or else people who have long since died will be angry at you, oh and the current parent who hasn't died (the father in both cases) will either threaten to or indeed literally beat you senseless.",/review/rw5285587/?ref_=tt_urv

4 April 2001,lwhite01,," parental relationships in ""Jungle Fever""
","In his opening sequence to Jungle Fever, Spike Lee introduces the pervasive theme of the appropriateness of sex. Through the red haze of a Harlem morning, we are introduced to Flipper and his wife Drew in a very compromising position. Entangled in both the sheets and a moment of passion, the couple begin their morning in copulation, all the while trying desperately not to `wake the baby.' This `baby' could be a child who they've already produced or a child who is potentially in the making.",/review/rw5285587/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2020,lasttimeisaw,8," Spike Lee's JUNGLE FEVER is still grievously topical for its content, but in its narrative form, it is one of his most lucid, cohesive practice
","""The truth is, there is another violent sting in the tail, but that doesn't concern racism and it occurs behind the closed door, that manifests the topos rampant among the key demographic, the drug addiction, yes, the Purify family has a black sleep, the firstborn of The Good Reverend Doctor Purify and his wife (Davis and Dee, both as expected, are terrific as a stern father and a doting mother, respectively), Flipper's elder brother Gator Purify (Jackson), is an out-and-out hophead who spends the whole film soliciting money from his kindred, a breakthrough turn from Jackson which notably earned him an acting award in Cannes, not for BEST ACTOR, but a special BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR (an award they don't accord annually), here Jackson is so lived-in in that jittery, jacked, importunate state as to dwarf Halle Berry's big screen debut as Gator's fellow crackhead into affected rants of profanity, and Lee also vehemently ram the hellscape of a crackhouse into every viewer's throat, if that doesn't dissuade you from shunning the substance abuse, nothing ever will.""",/review/rw5285587/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2006,msjpacke,7," More about sex than race
","This movie is more about sex than race. Lee was quoted in the NYT as follows: ""I hate this whole Hollywood process of breaking down a movie to one sentence,"" he said. ""My films don't deal with one theme. They interweave many different things. You have to think. I'm not saying interracial relationships are impossible. Flipper and Angie are not meant to represent every interracial couple in the world. They are meant to represent two people who got together because of sexual mythology instead of love. Then they stay together because they're pushed together. They're outcasts. And since their relationship isn't based on love, when things get tough, they can't weather the storm."" Thus at its core this film is a feminist critique of the nature of sexual attraction in contemporary America. These folks are wrong for each other but they both are stereotypically ""attractive."" There is ""chemistry"" between them, but no shared values that are the bedrock of a serious relationship. The ""black stud""/ ""sexy white girl"" is just one way this could be instantiated.",/review/rw5285587/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2004,yossarian100,2," Too highly stylized and stereotyped
","Jungle Fever is too highly stylized, stereotyped, and comes across as essentially dishonest. Wesley Snipes was wrong for the lead and there was no chemistry between him and Annabella Sciorra. Even though there's plenty of talent in this movie, it's mostly wasted because the parts are reduced to little more than decorative cameos. Also, instead of simply showing racism for the ugly and stupid thing it is, Spike Lee chooses to wave it around like a flag in a most whining and irritating manner. I made it through most of the film but I couldn't quite finish it, and that, for me, rarely happens.",/review/rw5285587/?ref_=tt_urv

31 August 2016,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,9," Excellent piece of African-American cinema!
","JUNGLE FEVER, in my opinion, is an excellent piece of African-American cinema! I thought that Gator (Samuel L. Jackson) really needed to grow up and get a life. The Good Reverend Doctor Purify (Ossie Davis) really scared me when he got angry. When Mike (Frank Vincent) assaulted Gloria (Annabella Sciorra) after finding out what happened between her and Flipper (Wesley Snipes), my mouth dropped open and I gasped. After Drew (Lonnette McKee) got mad, I wanted to cry. Still, this was a very good movie. Everything about this movie was good, especially the costumes and performances. In conclusion, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a good time, I guarantee it!",/review/rw5285587/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2001,arthurpewty,," Judging it again years later
","I saw Jungle Fever for the first time years ago, when it first came out on video. By the movie's end, I was lost. Part of it may have been maturity - I was in junior high - and part of it was that the movie I was sold was not the movie I got. Part of this selling is Stevie Wonder's title song, which frequently finds its way into my tapedeck. And the kind of color-blind love Wonder sings about is not the relationship in this movie. Something I feel now as I felt then was that the film does not let us get close to these people, let us see them in love. Only now do I realize that this is because the film is not about two people in love. When I first saw it, I thought the film was advocating segregation from the ""other side."" Now I realize that it just showing the complexity of issues which come to play when a black person and white person from separatist neighborhoods come together, and mostly how those environments are changed. There are things to overcome, but this relationship will not overcome them. I am still puzzled by the rather large subplot involving Samuel L. Jackson as Wesley Snipes's crackhead brother and by the final shot where Wesley Snipes clutches a crack-whore to himself and screams ""NO!"" while the camera rushes from halfway across Harlem to end in a close-up on him. It's indelible - most of what has stuck with me about this movie over time involves this subplot and that shot - but I am still puzzled by its intention in the overall scheme of what the film is trying to say. Something about the endless problems facing black people?",/review/rw5285587/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2006,zetes,7," Pretty good, but a bit dated
","Definitely not one of Spike Lee's best films, and definitely a bit dated after 15 years. But it still holds some interest. It's a whole mishmash of racial issues, of the director and of the actors (many scenes seem to be improvised) dealing with their own thoughts. Often Lee shows his own prejudices. In 1991 at least, it doesn't seem like he thought black people and white people should be involved romantically. When Lee was promoting the film at the time, he implied that people of two different races were only attracted to each other because of stereotypes they had in mind. I think we still have a ways to go, but I think a lot of the barriers that may have been in place in 1991 have crumbled. The two main characters, played by Wesley Snipes and Annabella Sciorra, are fairly weak. I don't think either of them are especially good actors. Snipes has always been rather mediocre. The film is much stronger with its supporting characters. Samuel L. Jackson was much lauded for his performance as a crackhead. He is very good, though I think Lee makes him a bit too humorous at times (though certainly he is downright frightening at others). I also thought John Turturro was excellent as the boyfriend Sciora dumps for Snipes. Honestly, I don't think Turturro can do any wrong. The film ends on the silliest note possible. Still, I rather liked it for the most part.",/review/rw5285587/?ref_=tt_urv

","Flipper Purify (Wesley Snipes) is a black architect with growing recognition, aiming at becoming partner at his current firm. Married with child his wife Drew (Lonette McKee) and daughter Vera (Veronica Webb) are seemingly the apple of his eye. When given an assisrant of Italian roots, Angie Tucci (Annabella Sciorra), Flipper initially objects on racial grounds, opting for a black-skinned subordinate. These reservations soon come to pass, when working nights together they soon uncover a growing fascination with each other, despite their differing skin colours. This soon turns into a romance, which crosses racial boundaries, causing a stir in both neighbourhoods and making them outcasts from their families...",/review/rw5285587/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2022,christopher-underwood,8," It is all very sad
","A very interesting and well made film but as it gets more into the problems the more terrible it becomes with the people and more about racial issues. Wesley Snipes works in an office and is given an Italian woman as a secretary. He pretty soon complains that he wants a black girl instead. In the end he likes her and has sex in the office and they end up living together. She asks if they might have a child and he says no because he would only want a black child. With the Italians are not happy of any one of the people who are black and will kill their own, girl or man. Just to make the film even more complicated is poor old Samuel L Jackson, who in reality is just 2 weeks out of rehab, and plays it that way and he is terrible. It is all very sad but things may have changed now, at least in New York. The film is, I assume, a reasonable account by Spike Lee of how things were at the time.",/review/rw5285587/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2014,vincentlynch-moonoi,7," Superb; my favorite Spike Lee film
","As I was reading through some of the other member reviews here, I decided to respond to arthurpewty's review. At quick glance, and in large part because of the title of the film, this appears to be about Black men wanting White women and White women wanting Black men. And if that's what you think this film is primarily about, then the way the film ends, and the subplot involving the crack-addicted son will be confusing. I actually think that the more definitive message of this film -- one that is explored through a racial theme -- is that lots of families (of all colors) are pretty screwed up. If you look at the film from that perspective, it becomes an ensemble film, rather than a ""starring"" film, and it explores how screwed up multiple families are, all tied together in some way.",/review/rw5285587/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2020,briancham1994,9," Compelling
",This film is a very compelling tale of many characters in their own subplots all facing their own race-based issues. This type of film has to approach the subject delicately and try to show these issues openly but also try not to exaggerate them too much and end up alienating the audience.

25 October 2006,jzappa,8," A Film Only A Master Filmmaker Can Pull Off The Way It's Been Pulled Off
","Spike Lee is unfortunately judged more based on his political involvement and the sparks that fly sometimes with him and other celebrities. If he were more often judged based on his films, he would be revered. He is truly a master, one of the greatest of all time. He has a way of making the audience face the story and its characters as if the situation were right there in the room with them that hardly any other director has, no matter how brilliant. He has such an uncanny ability for capturing realism in its rawest form, a form somehow linked to his hypnotic cinematic style, which is constantly developing further into something even greater and more innovative. Not only have I never seen a Spike Lee film that I haven't liked, but I have hardly seen any that I wouldn't give a rating of 10 on this site.",/review/rw5285587/?ref_=tt_urv
