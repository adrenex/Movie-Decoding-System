19 March 2022,NullUnit,8," Reviewers here don't have a clue.
","#1) It's not a ""rip off"" of HBO's ""Somebody Somewhere"". They are NOWHERE near similar. This is an ""Americanized"" remake/reshooting of the BBC's ""This Country"" -- I mean down to the fact the lead actresses look exceptionally similar in both This Country and Flatch.",/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv

",Sean William Scott and the ensemble cast are funny and sweet in this mockumentary. The only character I'm not 'in-like' with is Kelly. Better in the second episode.,/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv

",I wanted to like this show.,/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2022,confidential-67897,6," Ok start
",Those who are hating on this show should maybe remember that season 1 of pens and rec started off slow and only got into its stride in season 3. I think it's a good start with a good cast and has lots of potential.,/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2022,gibbs-78919,9," More please
",I'm from rural America. This is real! The lack of familiar names & faces adds to the authenticity of the characters and stories.,/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2022,thespeedhomestead,8," So much potential
","If you're a fan of mockumentaries, you can easily see the potential in this show. It's definitely getting its footing, but even with that being said, it's has great moments. Holmes is almost effortlessly funny. Sam Straley is a great opposite and the balance between them is perfect. Also super excited to see Aya Cash in this. She's so good in The Boys. I think this show will hit its stride and be really, really great.",/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2022,doc-07460,8," Give it a chance
","From where I'm sitting, those who are giving this less than five stars and seriously negative reviews are people who have only watched the first episode. I've watched all seven (currently available via streaming), and it has potential. As a rule, I generally give a new show three or four episodes before deciding. If you're a fan of Paul Feig's work, you'll know what to expect - quirky, absurd and off-beat.",/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2022,jillh-94143,8," Fun and watchable
","For some reason I thought this would be a weird American knockoff of Letterkenny, but it is not. It has quite a few recognizable faces and the acting is spot on. It's a very easy watch and I quickly binged all 7 episodes on Hulu. Can't wait for more!",/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2022,bardielhartley,8," quirky, off-beat, and fun
","Give it a couple episodes to get to know these wonderful weird characters and understand the cadence and humor of the show. The reviews of Flatch on here remind me of early reviews of Napoleon Dynamite....this low-key kind of small town humor definitely flies over/under some people's heads. Overall, it's a fun and entertaining watch with some really punchy laugh out loud surprises. Looking forward to watching more.",/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2022,b4blue,10," First I was like, this is not the Office
","...but then I remembered I didn't like the first episode of the Office (US or UK) at all. Then I watched all the seasons 5 times. Give it a chance. It's more like Parks and Recreation. I haven't watched that again, but I liked it. I probably wont watch this again but right now it's nice.",/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2022,captspastic,7," Flatch-u-lence
","Yes, fart jokes & baseline, low-brow humor is the cornerstone of the show. Which if you've ever spent any time or lived in a small town, you'll know did this show is pretty on the mark.",/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2022,Claudia10000,," LOVE THIS SHOW
",Why all the bad reviews?? I catch myself laughing out loud which doesn't happen often! This show may be starting off a little slow but its got great potential to be an amazing show. The characters are so funny and I could see everyone falling in love with them just like parks and rec!! Hopefully this gets a season 2!!,/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2022,blakesjackson,8," It's funny. Don't hate.
",I thought it was funny. I guess a lot of people didn't like it but some of better rated things on here I think we're awful.. It made laugh out loud a couple of times. I hope it get renewed for a second season.,/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2022,jamesnorthunion,9," I grew up in rural Ohio in a town like Flatch...
","...and dear God does it nail the super small Midwest town aesthetic and culture. From personalities, to town interactions, to even the way people treat the Reverend. The only thing wrong with it? For Ohio, not enough OSU paraphernalia, and quite frankly, the people are nicer than small town Ohio ""Midwest nice"" individuals tend to be.",/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2022,CaitlinRTodd,8," Everyone needs to lighten up
","I think this show is hilarious! I was shocked by all the bad reviews. This show is the perfect way to decompress after a long day. I love that it has mostly unknown actors and Sean William Scott's role is delightfully different from his normal characters. Also, for those pissed about the ""misrepresentation of small towns?"" Stop lying to yourself. I grew up in a small town and there are hilarious similarities. I will gladly keep watching this show!",/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2022,amandaorsburn,8," Solid Show
","I feel like people don't understand a 1-10 scale at all. Weird amount of 1 star reviews, considering a 1 star should be an absolutely terrible show. This is light and fun, and I laughed a pretty decent amount. I'll keep watching. I read a review about this mocking small towns... I grew up in one, and it's really not that far off. Haha.",/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2022,vladas-5,7," Not Too Bad
","I am big fan of Daisy May Cooper and This Country. Main problem here is that main characters look like top tear models in comparison with This Country, same problem as in The Office. Plus is that you can understand what they are saying without subtitles (actually I prefer UK English accents, esp. Yorkshire so this is minus too). But if you didn't watch new This Country episode for several years this is close enough.",/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2022,mrspastrymaker,9," As a Brit, I liked it.
",I think the bad reviews are unfair.,/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,micheleapeoples,9," Kelly's facial expressions alone are a reason to watch!!
","If you want something you don't have to put too much thought into but want to get in a good laugh... give this one a chance. Kelly's facial expressions alone are a reason to stick with it. Each character comes with simplicity and complexity that makes you want to keep watching to see what their next venture is. I love a good mockumentary and this one comes with characters like Big Mandy, June and Nadine that you look forward to whatever is going to come out of their mouth next. I have to wonder how much of this is based off of someone growing up in a small town like Flatch and the people their encounter. I just hope there is more where that came from!",/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,loans_from_steve,9," Episode 3
",Episode 3 is hilarious !,/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2022,bcoby56,7," It's a easy to watch funny show
","This isn't supposed to be the best show ever made. It's funny, simple, and light hearted. The ""critics"" are looking to hard to find something wrong with the show and acting when it's really not that serious.",/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2022,uibpbtukv,10," Wonderful
",Went into it with low expectations and ended up absolutely loving everything about it. The acting is on point and the jokes are truly hilarious. Can't wait to watch more because this show is pure gold.,/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,midnightsoup,10," I absolutely adore Flatch
",My daughter and I never watch TV together bc we like different stuff being she's 14 and I'm 42 but for real omg Welcome To Flatch is by far the best funniest show I've seen in forever and my daughter and I watch it together and laugh till we cry!!!,/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2022,racheltopia,8," Real life Kelly and Shrub
","Finding some of the reviews so odd- I enjoyed it because it's awkward and weird- The characters may be believable to me because they ARE me, my BFF and all of my weirdly awkward friends. Now, they are exaggerated yes, because it's a comedy. Honestly, I love Stifler in this and I've wanted to love Aya Cash, but You're the worst let me conflicted- she is now simple and weird and real to me. It's lite and pleasant. If I were part of creating this... I would be very proud. Thanks guys. Gave me some ""parks and rec"" feels.",/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2022,ournewslettercoupon,10," PLEASE keep making these! Already watching episodes again
","The first season was great but season 2 hit a whole new level! I have watched the office about 30 times and I think for many that show is so popular because it is an anxiety reducer. Welcome to Flatch is ticking all of the same boxes. I think if they keep it going it will gain the same following as the Office. People need shows like this. It's hilarious, easy to watch and just makes you forget about real life. LOVE it. Please stick with it and make more! Everyone is so stressed out and we all need to laugh! Anxiety reducers will be the biggest sellers in the years to come, and this show is one of them. Give us 10 seasons at least:)",/review/rw8693311/?ref_=tt_urv
