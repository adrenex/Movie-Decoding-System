15 March 2011,hitchcockthelegend,10," That's right. I'm just a fella now. I ain't no different than anyone else no more.
","William Munny (Clint Eastwood taking the lead and directing the piece) is an old and retired gunman whose past misdemeanours would make the devil himself seem tame. Widowed and struggling to raise his two children on a paltry farm, he's tempted out of retirement for one last pay dirt job, the consequence of which provides violence - both physically and of the soul.",/review/rw0981858/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2018,Fella_shibby,10," This aint just a great western. Its an incredible movie with an awesome star cast n superb performances.
","Saw this in the late nineties on a vhs n revisted umpteenth number of times. Own a dvd of it.
Jus revisited few days back on a blu ray.
Back in those days, my grandpop was excited to see both his fav film stars, Eastwood n Hackman in the same film. The cast is awesomely strong. Eastwood, Hackman n Freeman.
This aint just a great Western. Its a great movie with awesome characters.
Eastwood playing a tough guy who has killed women and children in the past but trying to lead a decent honest life with his kids on a farm. He has become more weaker with age. His farm is going thru a loss n he is pulled into his darker side once again.
On the other side v have Hackman as a sheriff whos against people carrying guns in his town.
He is a bit autocratic n sadist when meting out punishment.
We have Freeman as Eastwood's old pal who during a shootout acknowledges that he aint no ruthless anymore.
All the performances r top notch.
Eastwood's direction is truly mesmerizing from opening shot n the editing top notch. The one liners are also memorable. Cinematography by Jack N Green is wonderful.
The film begins and ends with a beautiful wide shot, Eastwood standing at the grave near a tree, with a sunset in the background.
As a fan of Eastwood n western genre, i owed it myself to write a review of this film.",/review/rw0981858/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2007,jluis1984,10," Masterpiece
","Ford, Hawks, Leone, Peckinpah, all of them big names who have defined the Western genre in one way or another across the history of cinema, transforming what started as low-budget action films into an art itself where the American Old West served as setting for tales of mythical heroism, classic tragedies, and legendary adventures. Actor and Director Clint Eastwood is probably one of the most knowledgeable artists about the Western genre, as his acting career began as the legendary ""Man With No Name"" in the Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns of the 60s. As a director, he somewhat continued this legacy through movies like ""High Plains Drifter"" and ""Pale Rider"", but finally in 1992, Eastwood released what many consider his final ode to the Western, and his ultimate masterpiece of the genre: ""Unforgiven"", an epic saga about the deconstruction of the Western myths.",/review/rw0981858/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2000,cathyyoung1,9," Unforgettable
","""Unforgiven"" may well be Clint Eastwood's greatest triumph as an actor and director.  In this grim, dark, and yet strangely beautiful story of former gunslinger William Munny (Eastwood), who comes out of retirement for one last job, Eastwood deliberately sets out to demystify the old West.  This is evident in the conversations between Munny and the Schofield Kid (Jaimze Wolvett), who has a romanticized image of the old-time gunfighters, and between sheriff Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman) and hack journalist W.W. Beauchamp (Saul Rubinek).  Yet the ""demythologizing"" message doesn't feel forced; it is woven effortlessly into a gripping story that powerfully conveys the human cost of violence.",/review/rw0981858/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2016,Leofwine_draca,9," Reflective, contemplative revenge western is a real treat
","There's little to say about this supreme western that hasn't been said already, but I'll try anyway. It's a spellbinding film, and nothing like what you'd expect from the rest of Eastwood's career. This turns out to be both an ode to a dying genre (the central characters are old and regretful) and a film with a powerful, anti-violence moral. Eastwood is at the top of his game both in terms of his screen presence (never has he played such a fragile, human character in a western) and as a director. This is one of the most beautiful westerns I've ever seen, with extraordinary lovely landscape shots which look fine when played in high definition.",/review/rw0981858/?ref_=tt_urv

","Unforgiven is about as far from the fantasy mythos of A Fistful of Dollars as Clint Eastwood could get.  No pin-point accuracy with 19th century technology, no desire to 'play fair' and face the enemy on even terms.  If you can shoot him in the back...then do it.",/review/rw0981858/?ref_=tt_urv

","Not only that but one of the best of the western genre. Unforgiven is simply brilliant. Clint Eastwood's direction is superb, and he is also exemplary in a suitably world-weary role. There is also some brilliant support playing, not only from Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris, but also especially from Gene Hackman.",/review/rw0981858/?ref_=tt_urv

23 September 2009,Hitchcoc,8," Sickness and Death
","I just felt awful after seeing this film. I had that same feeling after watching Taxi Driver and Deliverance. There is never a bright light anywhere. We begin with Eastwood's character visiting his wife's grave. He is a sad, defeated man. His life has been given over to violence and the one person who has salvaged some of it is now dead. Enter a young gunslinger who doesn't know anything about killing and what is involved in it. He is on his way to kill a couple cowboys who were responsible for the maiming of a prostitute. Eastwood falls to the need to feed his little children because his hogs are sick and bad times are on the way. He engages his old friend played by Morgan Freeman and get the bunch of them in way over their heads. If there is a more complete villain than Gene Hackman in all of film, I'm not sure who it is. He is killing machine who is in control of his empire. He lives on the fear of others. He brutalizes people and then grins. He is working on a house, hoping to sit down and enjoy the sunsets at some point. But you don't mess with him. Everyone understands that and they fall in line. Ultimately this movie is about the price of killing. Despite his declining years, Eastwood has had a stomach full of it and when his friend is brutalized by Hackman, well, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. It's just that it brings on the darkest feelings in the soul. Maybe that's the point.",/review/rw0981858/?ref_=tt_urv

A young man calling himself the 'Schofield Kid' hears of this and approaches retired gunslinger and general ne'er-do-well William Munny proposing that they kill the cowboys for the reward.

19 January 2006,tjcbs,10," How the west was
","This film was a revelation, a western that DOESN'T LIE. The whole theme stripping away the mythology our culture has built around the west, scraping it away like the finish on a mirror and reveling the ugliness AND the humanity beneath. I was utterly convinced, both by the portrayal of the period and the reality of the characters. A large focus was its treatment of the subject of killing. The movie SHOWS US what it is like to kill a man, a stark stark contrast to the casual attitude taken by so many other westerns. We see what we already know, wild west or no, that killing is something that most people just aren't capable of. And yet the character of William Munny shows us that in spite of the mundanity he embodies in his later life, true evil still existed then as now, and every now and then, true heroism.",/review/rw0981858/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2012,ironhorse_iv,8," It is unforgiven if you haven't saw this movie yet
","Before Clint Eastwood was talking to chair, he was making good films like Unforgiven. Unforgiven is a uniquely different Western, at the time as it gave the audience the most realist example of how life was like in the Old West. A group of prostitutes in Big Whiskey, Wyoming, are looking for any bounty hunter to kill two cowboys who disfigured a woman's face. Sheriff Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman), is wanting to keep the town peaceful and is against any bounty hunters coming in. Little Bill had given the two men leniency, despite their crime. News about the reward reached Kansas, where a pig farmer William Munny (Clint Eastwood) is approach by the Schofield Kid, a boastful young man to collect the reward. Clint Eastwood is a great actor, who able to hide facts with his eyes, and his facial expression. Much of the charm of the first part of the movie is how unlikely he could be a bounty hunter, but he go on to do it because he's raising two children alone and his farm is failing. On the way, Munny's friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) joins in for the search of the cowboys. They weren't the first to make it to the town. Back in Wyoming, gunfighter English Bob (Richard Harris) arrive in Big Whiskey, also seeking the reward. Little Bill and his deputies savagely beat Bob, hoping to set an example for other would-be assassins. When Logan and Munny got the chance—they were able to kill one of the cowboy. It becomes apparent that Logan and Munny no longer have much stomach for murder. Logan tries to return home. Logan gets captured by the Sheriff's men and this is where the story gets intense. This is where we see how bad-ass Munny is. David Webb Peoples, adapter of both Twelve Monkeys and Blade Runner, wrote the screenplay. He wrote when Munny drinks whiskey, it's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The audience does truly find out whom Munny really about in the last ending scene. That was where it shined. The beat up up, pig farmer was urged by multiple consequences to take a drink and the monster erupted with horrific consequences. Mr. Hyde took a lot of prodding but his reputation was well founded and could been worse if he was the Hyde that shed all humanity. He still had a foot in his human side. There is a film noir feel to the film full of ambiguity and atmosphere. The dark Western deals frankly with the uglier aspects of violence, deep and steeped in morality. It was a perfect fit, hand for a glove. The screenplay is unique, written for Eastwood to direct. Still, the film realism is kind of distracting and depressing. It tends to break up the myth of the West. Unforgiven is a film that doesn't hold a candle to Sergio Leone's brilliant Dollars Trilogy in any way. Certainly, it's a classic Western, regardless of it not following the classic theme. There is something appealing to a film that takes an old concept and makes it up to modern standard. Everything about this movie is good, from direction to acting! Gene Hackman's acting is keyed to the film to work. The Sheriff was right. The only way to handle real criminals is to show them you are meaner and more ruthless than they are. Hackman did a perfect job of demonstrating the ""style' that all good law enforcement people ""should"" follow to actually get the job done effectively. Today's soft, limp wrist, politically correct cops pay a very heavy price when incorrectly believing that they can warn and make friends with bad guys; and the politicians could care less how much they or their families suffer. It finds it kind of surreal that Little Bill is painted the villain of the film. Willy tried to be a family man, Bill wanted to build a house. Bill killed one man (a mercenary) and Willy Munny killed six (most of them innocents). Any way you look at it there were no heroes in this film. Clint's acting is just bar none, and it is a movie that has characters so compelling, it makes you wonder about the nature of humanity. Everybody soon learns a harsh lesson about the price of vindictive bloodshed and the malleability of ideas like ""justice.""",/review/rw0981858/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2005,murrayjp,9," Requiem for a Western
","Unforgiven will always be the last Western. No matter what comes after it, Tombstone, The Missing, or Wyatt Erp, Unforgiven has the final word. Not that I wouldn't characterize those films as Westerns, but the spirit of Unforgiven, from the opening shot of the house with the scrawny tree and lonely grave, to the end which returns there, is imbued with the finality of a spent genre. The feelings evoked are ambivalent and distant, much like the characters within Unforgiven itself. Perhaps Clint Eastwood's genius lies partially in that he doesn't allow for us to mourn. It wouldn't be western to cry because a story-form is over, it wouldn't be leather to empathize for a broken man who doesn't want your sympathy, it wouldn't be spurs to despair about the implacable and corrupt forces of life which turn men like William Munny into killers.

","There's a compelling scene in the movie where the scarred whore Delilah (Anna Levine) offers William Munny (Clint Eastwood) a 'free one', not from herself, but from one of the other girls. Munny's response has to do with the scars they both carry as a burden in their lives. For one brief moment, Delilah takes comfort in the fact that someone finds her beautiful after the savage attack that left her disfigured, and Munny realizes there are only just so many things he can hang on to before reverting back to his true nature, a grim, cold hearted killer.",/review/rw0981858/?ref_=tt_urv

10 December 2004,whstrock,9," An old man reconnects with his wicked past
","I enjoy the transformation of Clint Eastwood's character throughout the movie. In the beginning he reluctantly becomes a gunfighter but as the movie progresses you see how he slides down the slippery slope of wickedness to become the cold-blooded killer needed for the task. Morgan Freeman's reaction to the transformation is well played also. Richard Harris' character is colorful as is his sidekick. Gene Hackman's sheriff is pleasantly atypical of the role. All these actors and their characters effectively leave the viewer with a myriad of directions from which the movie expertly entertains. If you are expecting anything like Clint's ""spaghetti westerns"" you will be disappointed. If you are looking for an excellent story with characters that all have varying degrees of wickedness, you will be satisfied when its all said and done.",/review/rw0981858/?ref_=tt_urv
