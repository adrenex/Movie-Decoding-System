","There is always a suspicion when films come out with ""New"" in the title and particularly here, when you've had variations on the Police Story numbering over the years. Does it mean that the whole franchise has changed completely? Is Jackie Chan trying to pass on the mantle? How different is it really? Well, put it this way. The only thing that has changed is that it's better than the previous instalments.",/review/rw1495994/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2007,Coventry,8," Lifestyles of the Rich and Gamers
","It's almost tragic to establish that in Hollywood Jackie Chan exclusively gets cast to appear in lame action-comedies (like ""The Tuxedo"" and ""Rush Hour""), whilst in his home country of Hong Kong he's at least righteously offered to play serious roles and to be a genuine hard-fighting icon of action movies. ""New Police Story"" is everything but comical, it's a harsh and hardcore-to-the-bone cop thriller with an extreme overload of violent shootouts, dazzling stunts and relentless executions. The story is fairly original and adapted to the new type of crime-waves representing the post-2000 era, with Chan playing the cop who's up against an entirely new breed of villains: bored and spoiled rich kids obsessed with video games and committing violence purely for kicks. The youthful gang members inventively rob banks even though they don't need the money, have an insatiable appetite for destruction and  oh yeah  they really hate cops. When inspector Chan is a little too confident on TV about catching the thugs, they set up an ambush to sadistically slaughter Chan's entire team. The pain and guilt of losing his team drives Chan to drink heavily and neglect his police work, but a younger colleague slowly convinces him to solve the case and avenge his dead team-members. Like most Asian productions, ""New Police Story"" is rather long for an action film (slightly over 2 hours) but it's never boring or unnecessarily sentimental, not even during the relatively long period when inspector Chan mourns over his departed friends and colleagues. The action sequences and stunts are downright sensational; the highlight being an excessively destructive bus-out-of-control scene through the crowded streets of Hong Kong. ""New Police Story"" in an almost non-stop and adrenalin-rushing series of spectacular stunts, but it's also very praiseworthy for Jackie Chan's tour-de-force acting performance. This is his first film in which his acting talent is actually a lot more impressive than his fabulous martial arts skills. Especially the sequences in which his character stumbles through dark alleys at night, incredibly drunk and heart-broken, are harrowing and very realistic. Grim, sadistic violence and real drama are very difficult themes to mix together, but this film seemly pulls it off without too much trouble. ""New Police Story"" isn't intended for the faint-hearted, but if you like your heroes invincible, your criminals ultra-evil and your action rough & explicit, this film comes with my highest possible recommendation.",/review/rw1495994/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2004,hellbent_64,8," The return of good Jackie Chan movies
","In comparison with his American efforts, any of his Chinese based movies easily outshines any of his newer US productions, and this particular one is no exception. Though Jackie Chan is getting older, it still doesn't stop him from making good (or bad) movies. It certainly doesn't stop a lot of US actors. If I can move like Jackie Chan does when I get to his age, i'd be glad. (Especially since I cant even do some of those moves now) The movie moves at a steady pace, with some parts that are a bit over-reaching and over-emotional, but has some really spectacular stunts and action. I am posting this review primarily as a counterpoint to the previous users comment. I don't understand why someone who doesn't like ANY of Jackie Chan's movies would write a (biased) review. I don't write reviews on movies I hate, and I don't go to movies featuring an actor/acress I don't enjoy, so I have to wonder why he did so.",/review/rw1495994/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 2004,gerrythree,," Well Made Action Movie
","'New Police Story' shows how top production values, a well-known cast, a fine action director and a great director of photography can turn a pretty moronic screenplay into an entertaining action movie. One way to see the fine job done here is to compare Nicholas Tse's performance here in a pivotal role to the part he played in 'Goddess of Mercy,' an HK movie involving police made in mainland China. In that movie Tse played his role as a bad guy as if he were overdue for a dialysis treatment, unsmiling and shabby looking. In 'New Police Story' he is full of life, playing a key role that initiates much of the action. Charlene Choi, in a supporting role as an HK police woman, also helps keep the action moving (without overdoing the perkiness). If Jackie Chan wants to play serious his role as an inspector whose life has gone on the skids, he has the sense not to overdo it after an early scene where he is so drunk he throws up in an alley. As a star vehicle for Jackie Chan, 'New Police Story' does the job. Next time, though, Jackie should make the villains more believable.",/review/rw1495994/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2010,jadzyuk,7," Love it!!!
","I watched this movie a couple of days ago and I love it, I haven't watched such an amazing movie in ages. I would really, really advise everyone to watch this, it's another spectacular movie from Jackie Chan and co. I love all the actors and actresses and I think their performances were phenomenal. Everything about the movie convinced me it was real and I think that it took a lot of courage to perform the stunts they did and I really honour them for that! I really haven't got anything bad to say about it, I wish that everyone would watch it and if you are a Jackie Chan fan, then you should definitely watch it and comment too, because it deserves all the credit and gratitude from the fans. I loved to see a lot of my other favourite actors, such as Daniel Wu, Andy On, Hayama Go, Terence Yin, Coco Chiang, and I know they are all of the terrorists or whatever you want to call them, but I know them all and love them all.",/review/rw1495994/?ref_=tt_urv

","With New Police Story, Jackie Chan is obviously trying to change his image.

","After so much good review and the relatively high critics on this movie, I really thought it is going to be something like the first or the second in the Police Story Series, but unfortunately this is not so. The plot and character of Jackie's movies rarely were criterion for judging them. Most of his movies are funny. Some of them were serious action movies. The director of 'New Police Story' hasn't decided which side to take, and has mixed both humor and tragic to it.",/review/rw1495994/?ref_=tt_urv

","Let's face it, the movie is just bad. Jackie Chan is too old to be doing heavy duty fighting so he is trying his super powers at acting in something more that just bad heavy muscled Europeans trying to kill him and his girlfriend. And he fails miserably. It's not that he actually played very bad, but the script was hideous. There was no comedy, the ideas in it were completely unbelievable and even the fighting kind of sucked.",/review/rw1495994/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2013,mariecx,10," One of Jackie Chan's best. Griping story, action and drama.
","Definitely the best of the Police Story series, and one of the best movies that Jackie's been in. As much as I love his comedy, I really enjoy seeing him do straight drama. The story and the action are riveting and pretty much nonstop. A small gang of punkass teens are after money and have an insatiable thirst for cop blood. And they are pretty brutal about getting both. The way they go about their mayhem is pretty clever and twisted. One of the best things going in this movie are the teaming of Jackie and Nicholas Nse. Nse's fast talking, smart mouthed younger cop makes a perfect match for Jackie's seasoned and serious veteran. They play off each other perfectly with touches of subtle humor here and there. I would have loved to see them paired up more as this cop duo, but it's now 9 years later already and even Nse himself isn't a kid anymore.",/review/rw1495994/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2005,nilay,5," Terrible let down
","This film i was really looking forward to was a Terrible let down. The villains were jokes, they were totally unbelievable and a disaster. The plot didn't fare much better, it was too unrealistic and completely stupid at times, also it didn't manage to interest me in the slightest. The actors all tended to overact far too much, although Jackie was alright. The film wasn't even very entertaining, i was finding myself bored at many points, since the plot didn't hook me in. The only reason i sat through the film was because it had decent action sequences (Espeicially the final one) and the beautiful women. In restrospect i really only enjoyed the last 2 minutes of the film. i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a great new Jackie Chan film, let alone a good action film, it will truly disappoint. Although Jackie Chan was decent in this film, he didn't do anything new or exciting for my taste, his acting wasn't great and his stunts are becoming less dazzling as his body ages, still hes much better than i ever will be at that age. Overall i was disappointed with this film. There fore i could only give this film 4/5 out of 10",/review/rw1495994/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2010,brandon_lee420,9," A can of Kick-ASS!
","Having only watched only one film of his ""...Police story"" film, I randomly decided to rent out an action film. After a lot of searching around my eyes were stuck to New Police Story because it got a reasonable score on IMDb: number one site to search up films! The films blurb was interesting enough to make me rent this film our and after finishing this, I am glad and happy for the price I paid for this film. First thing you need to know is that this film is no Ong Bak or The Protector but it is different in it's ow way. The story is far more interesting than Ong Bak's and the action isn't one o one style all the time because there will be moments in the film where guns, traps, and even bombs are used to make the film a lot more fun and way more unbelievable. Apart from all the fighting stuff, there are a lot of stunts used in this film, like the part where Jackie Chan makes an entrance into a rampaging bus. Or maybe the part where he is dangling from the burning rope. Even the stunts were unbelievable at times. Jackie Chan is fantastic as ever in this film and this time his police story is far more interesting and funner to watch. I like the way that he is seen with such heroism but quickly descends down and tries to make a scene again and maybe regain his reputation with his fellow police officers. The heist scenes are cool to watch and with all the crazy monkeys leaping around the place, it is hard not to treasure scenes like those. The movie would have had ten stars if it wasn't for the length that was used for this particular film. Isn't an action film supposed to be fun, short, and nonsense. This film definitely has fun, a little bit of nonsense, and definitely sucks in length. If they had made the movie a bit shorter, it would have been the perfect action film. The plot is more interesting than the whole action bits whole together because the story is more heavy and, surprisingly, quite good. Jackie Chan is truly the best I have seen in a long time to star in a film, his acting has rather improved a lot but his great acting comes with a price: he hardly is humorous in the film. That is good in a way since this film deals with situation that are meant to be taken seriously. Jackie Chan is awesome and continues to amaze us with this film. His role is an self-guilty police officer who witnesses the death of his entire team is emotional, making it his most emotional role in his life. I, especially, love his fighting style and his performance. Bravo! So if Jackie Chan has no humor in New Police Story then where do we get it from. Answer: Nicholas Tse. Nicholas Tse plays a huge and important part in the film because he is the one who urges Jackie Chan's character, Inspector Chan Kwok-Wing, to stop his drinking habit and to come back in order to capture the mysterious, intelligent gang led by Joe Kwan, Daniel Wu, which is the named The Gang of Five. Nicholas is the stand in comedian for Jackie Chan. He looked like he wanted to be a mini - Chan and he mostly succeeds. Daniel Wu plays an evil gang leader who hates cops and wants to cause havoc. His team is rich, young fellows who have nothing better to do thank kill cops and rob banks. In Joe Kwan's case it is a whole different case. He doesn't come from a wealthy family like his gangs and throughout his childhood, he was beaten by his dad and his anger for the cops started from then on. Daniel Wu has everything to be a villain but often he disappoints.",/review/rw1495994/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2009,y_u_g_0,1," Jackie Chan Fan's lament
","I am a film critic that dislikes writing bad reviews. But i feel especially dishonored in writing this review, as it stars my favorite actor - Jackie Chan. Don't get this wrong, I'm not just disappointed in seeing my man Jackie in a bad movie(The Medallion and The Tuxedo weren't impressive) this is a critical and honest review. The film tries to be dramatic, without having any idea what message it's trying to convey, it's slow paced and the action scenes were filmed half-heartedly. The movie seems to portray Police officers as either cowardice, bullying, incompetent, corrupt and - or - moving targets. The villains are a group of rich, bored, thrill-seeking youths who commit high-stakes robberies and shoot cops as part of a game. The more cops the 'players' shoot, the more points they earn at the end. Sophisticated entertainment? Not only are their actions glorified (at least to some extent), attempts are made towards the end to draw sympathy to these sociopaths, on the grounds that their parents misunderstood them. This is an offense to the HKPD, surely? The director has no understanding of the audience, nor the slightest clue of how to film action scenes. It was once fun to watch Jackie ride on top of a bus as it drives out of control through the streets, or him tear through a shopping centre, but it came off bland. The authenticity of the death-defying stunts seen in other HK flicks, (Who Am I? being a noble example) was just not there. The majority of the movie captures him weeping over the death of his teammates, with one terrible instance where he falls on his knees in true melodramatic-opera style, in the middle of a fight scene. This is not the hero his fans have, for so long, been devoted to. In fact I objected to the very casting of Jackie Chan for I would have otherwise not bothered seeing it. The fights mostly involved guns, and the single bout that was worth any merit could have easily been executed by any dozen of cinema's rising martial-art stars. Having said this much, I should mention that this movie is part of an old franchise, as the 'new' bit in the title suggests. Yet whilst I enjoyed Rocky 6 and Die Hard 4.0 this series-reboot fails. Firstly, the Jcakie character in the earlier Police Storys' was a loose cannon and short-tempered, your old fashioned ""it's not over 'til it's over"" guy. Where the hell was he? I was first convinced the English-speaking distributors simply borrowed the title so that it would be familiar to the West, but I checked it out - it was actually intended as a Police Story sequel. What a waste. It seems they gave the production to a director who knew nothing about Police Story or Jackie Chan, disliked cops, and gave him a low budget. The film is ridiculously slow-paced for a police/action film, it milks dramatic scenes until it loses all impact, there is an absence humor, charm, and the exciting fight Jackie Chan is famed for. I really shouldn't judge Benny Chan, for this is the only film of his I've seen, but I can't help thinking it was all his fault. The heroes are dis-amiable and he seems to barrack for the bad guys the whole way through. The gang-leader continues to win up until the very end, he murders for sport, kills his lover instead of taking her to a hospital and shoots his friend in front of his parents. OK, I might as well give away the ending - the bad guy dies in a Police-Assisted Suicide, in slow-motion, as tears runs from his eyes (the same guy that laughed while he executed innocent people). After all this, the satisfaction of a good revenge-ending is robbed from us, as if Benny Chan expects the slightest show of sympathy to this mass-murderer. Before panning the film further, there is one thing I need to say. The pain Jackie displays (mentioned above) is genuine. But as he weeps on his knees in front of the camera, his fans understand - or at least I understood - that his character's failure to save his friends, is allegorical of the real Jackie's inability to live up to his glory days. Truly sad viewing, of a super-star's fading shine. PS don't watch this.",/review/rw1495994/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2007,Edermike,4," Against all Jackie usually stands for
","I have a few good things. It is nicely filmed and the side kick got in a few funny lines. The rest of it, the swearing, the bloodshed, the cgi graphics. All of this is against what he always stood for. If this was the only Jackie Chan movie I had seen I would never watch another. I have seen almost all of his films, where are the morals here? Where are the life lessons. This movie left Me in a dark mood. Crime Story shows that Jackie can play a straight role, but why make a Chinese version of a Steven Segal movie. Hope he never tries this type of thing again. This has nothing to do with the other Police Stories, and should not be marketed this way. Every one of the Police Stories were progressively worse but the first three still hold up, and the initial one is near perfect. Yet even the clichéd feel good number four that perhaps went too far in the other direction of being too cuddly has so much more to offer. Jackie can do more roles suited for his age, tired of him using his once forbidden special effects to be who he was 20 years ago.",/review/rw1495994/?ref_=tt_urv

13 October 2006,mykungfuistrong,5," Not as bad as some US releases, but close
","Some have touted this as the best Chan film in 10 years...well, that's not saying much, is it? For fans of his pre-Rush Hour, we know that his American films have been mostly American-style comedy with light action...pretty mediocre fair. Jackie's Hong Kong films however have amped up the action and have always had a delightful appeal in that they don't try too hard in the story or acting departments. They're generally loosely linked narratives with slapstick comedy in-between awesome stunt/martial arts scenes performed to physical perfection. No CG, wires, gore, sexual or lingual explicitness. Well, NEW Police Story is right as this film adopts the more serious tone and gloss of a Hollywood film. It's a misstep for Chan's HK work, which has always had a simple appeal to it. Once you try a real story, you have to put some thought into it and this one is COMPLETELY implausible. There is NO attempt to show realistic police-work or tactics. The film does allow for some surprisingly effective acting performances, but they're occasionally over-the-top. Chan may be older, but seeing him using wires and toning down the fights and action is soooo disappointing. He's still got the speed, and I just wish the fight choreography (for the measly 2 or 3 fights present) were more inspired. This film just has all it's emphases in the wrong places. It feels so typically Hollywood in its action sequences and deathtrap scenarios, only its emphasis on extreme sports and video-games in youth culture is about 10 years too late to be anything but cliché'd. This film attempts to take a different tack than previous Jackie efforts and is worser for it. You're better off watching the FAR superior previous installment (JC's First Strike), or any Lethal Weapon for a serious buddy-cop movie, or go back to Gorgeous or Who Am I? for some great recent Jackie action films that aren't pure martial arts.",/review/rw1495994/?ref_=tt_urv
