2 June 2009,yossarian100,10," An Instant Hit!
","I work with Nurses and Edie Falco does Nurse Jackie perfectly. Earthy, gritty, with hard hitting humor and heartbreaking drama. Sure, it may be derivative but it's seriously well done, and realistic, too.",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2009,blanbrn,9," Outspoken. Raw and visually revealing blended with laughs, yet at the same time it's touching and emotional.
","I must say give a big thumbs up for the new hit Showtime series ""Nurse Jackie"" which features one of the best and most hard working TV actresses around Edie Falco. Unlike Edie's award winning days as Carmela Soprano the elegant and naive mob housewife on HBO's ""The Sopranos"" this time her character is more blue collar yet she still has a dark nature to her no matter how caring she is. Edie is Jackie Peyton a nurse who charms and lights it up in this dark natured and raw funny comedy series one of the better made for TV in a long time.",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2016,paulcreeden,6," Disappointing toward the end.
",I watched the first five seasons on cable and watched the last two on Netflix. I am a registered nurse (for 39+ yrs). I was a huge fan of the show's initial seasons. I had great hopes for it. ,/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2016,ElessarAndurilS,8," Very good show with puzzling end
","Nurse Jackie is a good comedy because it is based on real life and nothing is more funny, horrible, tragic, {adjective here} than real life. Jackie is a great nurse who is not open to personal relationships even though she has the compassion of 100 people (making her a great nurse). She treats herself like crap while her patients get her best. Problem is she is hooked on pills. Pain killers seem to be the drug of choice but she isn't super particular just has the tolerance of a horse. She chomps down 80-100 mg oxy pills like a kid does gummy bears. She chews and snorts them to get the maximum effect from the dosage. Challenge is that this makes her an addict which comes with all the character flaws of an addict; lying, stealing, etc., doing anything to prevent running out of drugs. I think they go a little light on the severity of detox the few times she does. She has herself convinced that she does a better job when high, not an unusual self perception for an addict. The show has a lot of plot lines that take us through a well written story of her life and the supporting cast; mostly her co-workers at a city hospital's ER (which throws in its own set of funny and gross situations). Bad doctors accidentally killing people or being prevented from killing them through the nurses help. Some of the doctors grow and become good while others don't, but it is part of the humor.",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2009,william-351,10," Best show on TV
","I saw an ad for this series and didn't think I would like it. And it turned out it has the most brilliant pilot in my opinion. I love the subtle, undertone jokes. The drama is quite real, unlike, soap-opera ""grey's anatomy."" You get enough taste of every character and the things that nurses would have to deal with their job. I think the script is brilliantly written. If you expect typical hospital drama, you may not like this show. The humor is off-beat and quirky. This is the only show that I eagerly wait each week. Great characters and casts. I just wish the episodes are longer than 30 minutes and more than 10/12 episodes a season. I'm a big fan.",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2014,Red_Identity,," Pretty great
","This show, on a nutshell, is pretty consistent. I do think the third season was a dropoff in quality, but Season 4 bounced back up as the show's best and the quality continued. Falco is amazing, unsurprisingly, and she just makes it all look so effortless. The supporting cast is also pretty great, and the show knows how to use them for the most part. Weaver really stands out as the MVP of the supporting cast, and Falcinelli is also pretty great. I hope the show doesn't burn out anytime soon, that would be a shame. As it is now, I feel like the show's incredibly underrated. I definitely recommend this, it's a pretty great comedy-drama",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2018,putnamdavis,10," Funny characters and realistic portrayal of drug abuse
",Great job portraying the lengths that drug addicts go through to get their fix. Characters are hilarious. The later seasons are not as good as the earlier ones. I don't think they ever recovered from Eve Best leaving.,/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2013,WrathChld,8," Nurse Crackie
","Medical shows can be quite interesting with the patients, but with it being a Showtime series, I knew they would make it more intense. Plus with Edie Falco from the Sopranos and OZ; I thought it had a very good chance of being an enjoyable show.",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2011,info-966-203193,8," another excellent performance by Edie Falco
","When I heard that Edie Falco was in another TV drama I definitely had to check it out. I had hoped the writing was good, and I wasn't disappointed. Edie Falco as Nurse Jackie is brilliant as usual. She was great in The Sopranos and she doesn't disappoint in this. She is so gifted, she could make an alphabet recitation interesting. The character Jackie is troubled, complex and caring and she draws you in. The storyline is complex as I'm sure the character arcs will be. ",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2009,ConDeuce,8," Seems to be Getting Better as It Goes Along....
","I thought Showtime's new series""Nurse Jackie"" started off with good intentions and held promise but truth be known, I had little faith in it. It felt like a vehicle for its star, Edie Falco and though I respect her work, I couldn't understand how she could allow herself to get involved with a show that felt a little half baked.",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2020,elishawin2005,10," I'm way behind
","It's January 1, 2020 and I'm just now starting my own personal binge. Instead of pills it's this show. How is I'm just now jumping on board?! I can't stop watching and I love Jackie so much I have totally made an excuse for her every time she snorts another pill that has been stolen from the hospital candy machine. I mean how many times has the hospital screwed us, right? Almost like she's earned it! My only complaint is I wish the episodes were longer.",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2020,charlesadrienne,5," 5 stars for the cast alone
","Great cast and premise, and it kept me watching all episodes but i have several issues. I just binge watched it in May 2020 so I'm late in watching this. The show intrigued me because I like Edie Falco and Peter Facinelli. My fave character ended up being Zoey (Merritt). Although she is annoyingly cheery, she reminds me a lot of myself. From what all of my nurse friends say, the all love their job but they do complain about the CATTiness of the women nurses and the snobby doctors. So I think this show did a good job of portraying nurses. The cases did seem far fetched on here but it is a drama made for tv. I think cancer and flu patients being shown in every episode would get boring, lets be real. My problems:
Jackie's short hair. I just couldn't stand her with a bob haircut. I'm glad it ended up growing out in later seasons. I also hated her popping those pills like it was nothing. No water or anything. Just chewing them or swallowing whole. It was just annoying and got old in every episode, almost. The only time i liked Jackie's character was when she was clean for that full year. Very frustrating everytime she started using again. Im sure in real life, nurses or doctors can't actually do their job while intoxicated all day. But again, its tv, sooooo....
Then there is the whole doctors and nurses getting it on in random rooms. Im certain that doesn't happen. They made me hate jackie but made me root for her the whole time. Jackie is so selfish. She had such a good life and loved her job so much and they made her choose drugs over her family and friends and its very frustrating. I know a lot of drug addicts who have became clean and stayed clean so i know it is possible. The lies, the stealing, manipulation and selfishness are all things that drug addicts do but its frustrating to watch. The season finale was blah for me and i feel like i didn't get any closure. They should have either had her die from it or become clean for good, but not open ended so we have to wonder this whole time if she survived the OD. It would have been nice for it to conclude with her becoming clean for good. That way it would give watchers hope that people can become clean no matter what f^<#ed up things they have done, but it was very unfulfilling. All in all it was ok but I only continued to watch to see how her life would turn out.",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2015,blanche-2,8," Nurse Jackie - drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll
","Edie Falco, such a great mob wife on ""The Sopranos,"" here does a turn as ""Nurse Jackie"" in this series, with each episode a half hour.",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2014,verityadriana,10," Fantastic show, unusual, progressive and realistically representative.
","I will admit, I didn't have much hopes for this show, due to my own ingrained prejudices. Halfway through season one, I was hooked and now I genuinely think it is one of the best shows I have seen (nothing will ever quite match up to The Wire however). This show is SO funny, dark, serious and perfectly blends gritty drama with laugh out loud comedy. ",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2009,GeddyKat,," Nurse Jackie can give me a sponge-bath any day! Just hands off my pain meds!
","WOW. I watched episode 1 of Nurse Jackie this morning OnDemand. I LOVE her INSTANTLY! Edie Falco has brought to life a character I can really enjoy. The supporting cast is not full of stereo-typicals, and they compliment the show. I am so looking forward to next weeks' episode! I have heard a lot of comparisons of Nurse Jackie to Dr Gregory House. I doubt any of these critics watched the show. Being injured & dependent on Pain Meds is where the likeness ends. Dr. House is a louse. Nurse Jackie CARES. She has HEART. She FEELS. The show reminds me of the original E/R from way-back-when. The one with Elliot Gould, Jason Alexander & baby-face ACE...a young George Clooney. I really enjoyed that show too.",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2015,skay_baltimore,5," Anatomy of a sociopath
","Good premise. Decent first season. Then, not unlike too many other shows that start out with a lot of potential Nurse Jackie quickly runs off the rails and never gets back on track. This show suffers from the all-too-typical ""caricatures rather than characters"" syndrome. There are simply too many one dimensional cartoon characters in this show to even begin to take it seriously. ""Coop"". Zoey. Thor. All cartoonish immature 1 dimensional clowns. And that's simply unacceptable. So is its schizo nature of taking itself way too seriously then not taking itself seriously enough. And so is the problem of having no one to really care that much about. So in short, this show is neither here nor there, and as such, the net result is a big waste of time.",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2021,anthonylawrence-11254,9," Honestly misunderstood.
","Preamble: People complain about the ""unrealistic"" nature, over the top drama and even the campiness despite going on to love any other movie or tv show. Every piece of literature takes creative license to bend reality. To say this show is bad because it is unrealistic is to say Sherlock Holmes is irredeemably horrible.",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2017,qui_j,4," A soap opera with really unbelievable medical practice
","The premise of this show is a study of addiction in a Nurse who can function while still being an addict. The focus is supposed to be on the characters and their interaction with one another. The problem is that it's set in a hospital where the medical situations are totally implausible and unbelievable. Many of the things that the nurse does in the series would just not be possible in a hospital. She knows more than the doctors, speaks to people like she's in charge etc. While I'm all for strong female leads in series, they have to be put in believable situations, not constantly living in a fantasy world. This departure from reality gets worse as the series progresses. If attention had been paid to detail, and maybe the show had a medical consultant to advise on the situations, it might have a bit more credibility.",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2020,BennyBamLegacy,8," Well done but transitionally abrupt.
","Love the show. Only issue I would have is a lot of end of season random drops of the ball. Characters disappear randomly. I do appreciate the crisis and addiction storylines taken head on, but some seasons seem more important to the show runners than others. Ultimately Nurse Jackie is about how you have to live as obstacles arise then go on no matter what. Merritt is a treasure in this show and is proving that again in shows like Godless. Nurse Jackie is a quick binge style show. Quick episodes with some medical but this is more about the people than any deep dive into the medical profession. It is a drama set at a hospital, not a drama about a hospital.",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2018,reputederror-1,4," It gets a little old...
","Yes, I watched all seasons. At first it was okay. It wasn't really funny, there are a few spots that I laughed. It got a little ""broken record"" for my liking. I am honestly glad that ended it because I was begining to hate Jackie. Everybody bent over backwards for her and she didnt care. I felt like she broke Zoey's spirit in the end. I honestly think they could have wrapped this up after a couple seasons. They didn't need to drag this on for this long.",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2021,gsboy1000000,10," Love the show, the actors, the writers
","It's brilliant and so human human human! I cried like a baby at the end because I love Jackie I respect her I admire her, but and I'm so sad, I knew to well what will happen, once an addict always an addict.
I admire profoundly the authors for their mastery and brilliant creativity, thank you for giving us one the most brilliant series on TV...BRAVO",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv

1 November 2015,SnoopyStyle,8," Edie Falco is the best
","Jackie Peyton (Edie Falco) is an experienced nurse in the public All Saints Hospital in NYC and she's a drug addict. Her marriage to Kevin (Dominic Fumusa) is in trouble. The oldest of her two daughters Grace (Ruby Jerins) is suffering from the family dysfunction. At the hospital, Zoey Barkow (Merritt Wever) is the naive, new nurse. Eddie Walzer (Paul Schulze) is the pharmacist, Jackie's enabler and her secret affair. Thor Lundgren (Stephen Wallem) is the gay nurse. Gloria Akalitus (Anna Deavere Smith) is the manager. Dr. Fitch Cooper (Peter Facinelli) is self-obsessed with a nervous OCD to grab women's privates. Dr. Eleanor O'Hara (Eve Best) is Jackie's rich best friend. In season 5, the staff is joined by new resident Dr. Carrie Roman (Betty Gilpin).",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2011,bob_meg,3," Do Not Resusitate
","Don't get me wrong, the premise for Nurse Jackie is great. Edie Falco plays Jackie Peyton, a Vicodin addicted nurse whose whole world (and this series, it turns out) are held together by the hope that nobody will discover her dirty little secret. During the day, she's the Champion ER Nurse of All Time, showing both compassion and brains while bucking the system that promotes and protects profit-hungry hospitals and rock star egomaniac doctors at the expense of the everyday working man and woman. Bravo Jackie.",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2015,deloudelouvain,8," I need more drugs!
","Drugs, drugs, drugs! Interesting and funny show/drama about a drug addicted nurse. You can easily recognize the drug addict that you know in real life. Always coming up with excuses, or trying to fool everybody just to get their next fix. The constant lying to their entourage and themselves just to hide their addiction. Then trying to stop their drug habit but relapsing over and over again. People trying to help but not really understanding how an addict thinks and behaves. Edie Falco puts down a very good performance. The other characters are all very well played. Normally I do not like hospital series but this one is the exception. Watch this series and you could get addicted to it.",/review/rw3183262/?ref_=tt_urv
