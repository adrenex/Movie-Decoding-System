8 May 2004,cariart,6," Fourth Brosnan 'Bond' Starts Promisingly, but Falters...
","Creating new, exciting adventures for 007 after 20 feature films in forty years is a difficult task at best, particularly as public tastes change, and the character of James Bond has to maintain at least a degree of the 'persona' created by Ian Fleming. While the heirs of Albert Broccoli, his daughter Barbara and son-in-law Michael G. Wilson, have done a remarkable job in keeping the series 'fresh', if DIE ANOTHER DAY is any indication, the creative forces surrounding them seem to be losing 'touch' with James Bond, and his world.",/review/rw4827158/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2007,namideo,6," The End of an Era.
","It's the 20th Bond film and premiered on the 40th anniversary of the series, and, in many ways, it is really a tribute to the entire series itself. This film's strength and its weakness both lie in the fact that it is a blend of the classic Connery films, the outlandish Moore films, and the grittiness of the Dalton films. It's rolling the entire series into a single two hour adventure and the result is actually pretty entertaining. The first half is definitely stronger than the second; a more serious adventure with a classic feel to it, before taking a nose dive down into utter camp territory. I didn't mind the idea of making some scenes a little over-the-top, but I think they went overboard at times. Throughout the movie, the filmmakers toss in little references to previous Bond films. I suppose it's a fun idea to stop and consider how far these films have come over the last 40-something years, and a long time Bond fan can find amusement in finding these subtle, but long remembered treasures that poke their head in this film for one last time. As for the technical aspects of the film: The special effects are a little too ambitious and don't always come across convincing. The dialogue goes back and forth from excellent to atrocious. The ensemble of actors is pretty strong, except for Halle Berry, who in my opinion was completely wrong for a Bond movie. The villains are a little more dynamic. The action sequences are an improvement, in my mind. Granted, there are some instances where the filmmakers push the envelope a little too far, as mentioned above. However, they also show a certain amount of creativity that seemed to be lacking in the previous two films. Overall, this film is really a mixed bag. At moments there is potential for one of the greatest Bond adventures. At other moments you're thinking, ""What the heck am I watching."" Personally, I feel the positives balance out the negatives, but if anything, this film is a good popcorn movie. All in all, it wasn't a bad way to close out the series before rebooting it again with Casino Royale.",/review/rw4827158/?ref_=tt_urv

","On a mission in Korea, James Bond is captured and tortured for 18 months. He is swapped with Korean agent Zao for his freedom.  However M has swapped him not to save him, but because she believes Bond has cracked and is giving away information.  However Bond knows there is another mole in the area and escapes to uncover what Zao is up to and to uncover his Western ally.",/review/rw4827158/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2004,Theo Robertson,6," Better Than I Expected
","DIE ANOTHER DAY is a unique Bond film for me because I had seen the other entries in the franchise before I discovered the IMDb . In other words my only knowledge of its reputation is down to the comments I have read on these pages and because many commentators are so loud in their condemnation ( Bad CGI , awful title track etc ) I was expecting a really bad movie never mind a really bad Bond movie , but DIE ANOTHER DAY wasn't as bad as I was expecting ",/review/rw4827158/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2004,David_Frames,1," The Batman and Robin of the James Bond series
","Pis*-poor, Ill-conceived, soulless, mindless, horrifying - and thats just the title track in this 40th Anniversary defunctular - proof positive that the series is in terrible terrible trouble. In fact, based on the this exercise in self-parody (even the title sounds like a parody), devoid of any new or exciting elements, it might be worth pondering whether its time for the super-spy to take a sabbatical while all concerned contemplate a wholesale reinvention of the Francaise; a full-scale rebuilding from the ground up with absolutely no return to the cut and paste methodology that rots this one from the inside out. It isn't even worth discussing the story to this anniversary entry because there isn't one but it might be worth pointing out the contrast between this and the last anniversary story The Living Daylights (1987) for therein lies the clues to what's gone wrong with 007's exploits. Whereas Dalton's film used the anniversary as a sort of reaffirmation of principles and a throw back to the series dramatic and literary roots, a new dawn if you like (and frankly even if you don't), Die Another Dies goes the other way and represents the zenith of the Pervis/Wade era of Brosnan Bonds that has seen the action and budgets scale upward while the substance has conversely dipped and with the arrival of an invisible car, evaporated. This is about a trillion miles away from the 25th anniversary Bond in which familiar elements made the odd cameo appearance - the Astin Martin for example. Here the familiar is everything - in fact its the building blocks of the story (such as it is) and the characters and, well everything really. The tone is pure fantasy - deadly lasers in space, an evil ice palace lair for the villain, Madonna etc... Characters with silly names trade puns and insipid dialogue while Brosnan goes through the motions. If it was the intention of all concerned to make a companion piece for Austin Powers then they should consider DAD a roaring success. For those of us expecting a serious Bond movie however, its a minor travesty - Bonds have been lazy before (Moonraker, naturally) but this one completes the post-Goldeneye trajectory toward total self-parody and in doing so arguably takes its place along other genre greats such as Rocky 4, Star Trek: Nemesis and Batman and Robin in the 'film that crashed the series' category. Bond films have also been looking down the business end of oblivion before but 'tis no exaggeration to say that this time the martini loving super-spy is fighting for his life. Bond is a great character but unless the powers that be start to take him seriously again and refrain from this derivative fluff, they might as well call it a day.",/review/rw4827158/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2008,ametaphysicalshark,," Worst Bond to date
","To its credit, ""Die Another Day"" starts out reasonably well, even the much maligned title song actually isn't terrible. Then it gets worse, and worse, and worse. You know, there's ridiculousness that's enjoyable, like in ""GoldenEye"", then there's ""Die Another Day"", a movie so caught up in its complete silliness it forgets to realize it, thinking its overzealous use of gadgetry, its hilariously bad Robo-villain (cut me some slack, I couldn't think of a better nickname), and Halle Berry. Miss Berry is easily among the very worst Bond girls, and the fact that she's alongside Rosamund Pike, who manages to do such a good job with what little she's given, doesn't really help at all.",/review/rw4827158/?ref_=tt_urv

4 April 2011,bushtony,1," Die...diabolical
","There are Bond films that are so lacking in self-consciousness they just bring a smile to your face and make you feel good. Then there are some that are so resolutely self-satisfied, egocentric and hideously sanctimonious, believing they've got it so right when they've got it so wrong, it just succeeds in hacking one off. DAD is in the latter category. It is delusional as it presents as a smart and sassy crowd pleaser, slapping itself vigorously on the back for it's ""cleverness,"" when it's actually a misfiring, poorly conceived, badly scripted, appallingly acted, ineptly directed, chunk-blowing no-brainer that succeeds in insulting the audience like few Bond films ever have before. Those in the audience who were not insulted - you failed to notice, but you were in fact slashed and burned big time. Lack of insight has protected you this time, my children.

23 November 2002,kphurley-1,," Well, what did you expect??
","Look, let's be clear about it...it's the year 2002, not 1962.  This franchise of movies has evolved over the years from a cool and clever spy series to an over-the-top slam bang action series.  When you go to see a James Bond film, you should EXPECT any or all of the following: 1)  A completely unrealistic, contrived plot 2)  Unbelievably cheesy and corny one-liners (almost all of which are sexual in nature) 3)  A supervillain seemingly brilliant and mad enough to quest for world domination, but is somehow stupid enough to let Bond get close enough to spoil the whole thing 4)  A female counterpart (or several) that looks good, gets captured, and ultimately gets saved by our hero 5)  Gadgets, cars, and weapons that do fantastic, unbelievable things 6)  Action sequences and stunts that defy fundamental laws of physics and logic",/review/rw4827158/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2004,Jexxon,," About as bad as it can get...
","Of the four Brosnan Bond-films, this is by far the worst. The story is so stupid that you just don't care. Sure, Bond has always been more or less silly, (possibly except Dalton's films), but this looks more like a rejected Batman & Robin script. The filmmakers aren't even trying to base the film in real life anymore, (dna manipulation and invisible cars!?!). Instead, the attention is focused on mindless action scenes with seriously crappy CGI and effects.",/review/rw4827158/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2006,co010c6650,2," If Octopussy was an ' All Time High ', this is an ' All Time Low '.
","An outing which represents a first for the Bond franchise i.e. one that fails abjectly in virtually every discernible area. The most prominent one being that of a cut'n'paste, dog's dinner of a screenplay that looks as though it was cobbled together by the screenwriters during their dinner break. Previous entries such as 'OHMSS' and 'From Russia With Love' managed to treat their audiences with more than a modicum of intelligence. This is in stark contrast to D.A.D. which seemed to be aiming for an audience predominately populated by XXX-loving, popcorn-munching, baseball capped cretins who will demand the right to see as many things blown up as possible with at least as many people being either shot or wasted whilst being assured that such minor trivialities as 'plot' or 'characterization' are not allowed to spoil their enjoyment of proceedings.",/review/rw4827158/?ref_=tt_urv

","There is one of the widest cluster of spectators ever possible for a franchised movie. There is its own fans. For almost half a century from the old generations to the youth it is always advised that the 007-Bond movies are the best action & thriller of all. Yet to watch Die Another Day there are so many other reasons! Relying on the protection of its confidence and splendour, Die Another Day sight sees some of the larger-than-life and glamorous centres of the earth. In ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" Bond has visited Hong-Kong several times; and he does once more in Die Another Day. We are going to see Cuba for the second time after ""Golden Eye"", and again for the second time we will be in Bond's top-secret MI6 office in London,U.K after ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". We also have a chance to see unforgettably spectacular views from Hawaii's virgin hills and from Iceland. In fact, wherever it says it's North Korea, it's location is still Hawaii.

1 October 2015,Rickting,3," Possibly the stupidest action film of all time
","James Bond's 40th anniversary present was one of the worst anyone could receive: This. A turgid, CGI heavy, brainless car crash of an action film which isn't so much James Bond as laughably bad science fiction. Easily the most hated Bond movie to date and for good reason, this isn't quite at the bottom for me. Bond fails a mission in North Korea and is held in prison and tortured for 14 months. This is a powerful opening and shows one of the most indestructible movie heroes of all properly messing up for once. Unfortunately it then dissolves into a ludicrous plot involving diamond smuggling led by one of the worst Bond villains of all time which is so keen to reference every other Bond film that it's just a mess of undercooked elements with no tension, soul, realism or worst of all- fun. So the opening half hour is good, Rosamund Pike gives a good performance and there are thrilling moments occasionally. Also, the villain's plan is interesting and there are ideas which could have worked in a less silly film. This is supposed to be a celebration of James Bond. The equivalent would be celebrating vampire fiction with the Twilight franchise.",/review/rw4827158/?ref_=tt_urv
