22 July 2016,sasha99,10," Lean and mean Australian cop show
","I've binged my way through many American, British, and a few Australian cop shows and this is one of the best. I'm about halfway through season 2.",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2011,Deathbunny,8," Definitely not like an American show... in a good way.
","Frankly, I'm an American watching this show ""second hand"" via the internet, 72 minutes at a time. This means my frame of comparison is typical American cop dramas.",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2020,msghall,8," Superior murder/detective show with subtle wit and engaging plotlines
","Australian television series can be hit or miss but this one is a few grades above the rest. Buoyed by superior scripts and crisp direction, each episode unravels without the drawn-out emotional drama of other such shows. Yes, there are soap opera moments but they are brief and tightly written.",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2007,korinnem,10," Possibly the best Australian drama in years
","When I started watching this show I was very sceptical of what I was going to fine. I haven't watched virtually any Australian shows in recent years, as almost all that are touted as drama are soaps instead (e.g. All Saints, Blue Heelers).",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2013,Hyzenthlay-Foresight,10," One of the best homicide cop shows of all time
",I'm a big fan of Homicide life on the street and loved Detroit 187 and other shows like them. If you like those too you will live this. The first show almost lost me. It had really dorky music but a good story line so I watched a few more and fell in love.,/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2019,louiseransil,10," Can't Stop Watching
",Didn't expect to like it. Now I can't stop watching. Especially good plot lines and strong performances. Why haven't I ever heard of this show???,/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2020,jimvandemoter-50236,9," It ended too soon
","I just finished watching the last show of the series. I waited to write a review until I saw the entire run. Yes, this isn't the strongest Australian show out there, but overall it was a very good show. The entire cast was used equally with no one major ""star"" coming to the front. For me that is a plus. everyone had an equal part to play. One complaint, when the show ended it left everything up in the air. It could have run at least another season or two. All in all a very good show , well worth your time.",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2019,zombiemockingbird,9," Different, Really Good Show
","I liked this show from the first episode and it kept getting better. The characters are likable and the acting is good. There's a large cast and the focus is spread around so there isn't one main prima donna character; everyone pretty much shares the spotlight. There were a few shows that weren't as great as others but overall the stories were interesting and well done. My only complaint was season 5; it was only 6 episodes but focused almost exclusively on the ""Dane Majors"" case. After the first couple of shows it just got tiresome. They kept adding more and more to the story and kept dragging it on, and on, and on, and after a while it was more annoying than interesting and I started to lose track of what had happened, who the hundreds of people involved were, and I honestly just didn't care anymore. Except for season 5 I would have given this a 10/10 rating.",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2007,nickapopolis87,7," First rate drama
","I am always quite skeptical about Australian made dramas (and comedies for that matter). In my opinion it has never really been our forte, the writing talent hasn't been there. Fly-on-the wall, variety and reality: sure we excel but not in scripted stuff. But the times are changing, well on some networks at least.",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2019,ghearnshaw,10," Great Cop Show
","I like to watch shows from around the world. I found this show after watching Mystery Road, which stars Aaron Pederson. I really enjoyed that series, so I looked to find what else he had been in - hence I came to this show. Once I started watching it, I was quickly hooked. Only problem is the final 6 part series ""No Greater Honour"" does not appear to be available anywhere, which is frustrating. However, this is a great show, well written, with a great cast.",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2008,douglas_carrison,9," Brilliant show! Waiting for the next season!
","Last September, Mount Gambier's WIN Television station had a bit of a shakeup: WIN had signed an affiliation agreement with Seven (which people are still whining about almost ten months later), and we'd been getting the new programming. I'd started enjoying most of the new programming.",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2013,namers-1,8," This is the best crime drama most Americans haven't seen!
","I have been watching for several months on Hulu. Out of 84 episodes, I have 16 left; I'm stretching them out because I don't want to lose my 'friends.' I haven't loved the new characters but that is what shows with longevity do and so the writing keeps me loving it. So smart, witty, gritty (yay, not rated) and just an all around excellent police procedural.",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2020,ronalamont-91472,6," Enjoyable but has a ""low budget"" feel to it...
","Unlike other reviewers, I enjoyed this series to binge watch but felt it had many flaws. The plots were well-written and interesting, some of the acting was great, some dreadful, but the production values were very poor and the decision to shoot it in a ""reality"" show camera style left a lot to be desired although was a popular, innovative choice for that period. The signature use of a quick-cut montage of close-ups of pointless objects when cutting to a new location or story point deterred from the action rather than adding any drama or suspense to it. It was really ridiculous. Acting wise, Nadine Garner relies on three rather ""weird"" facial stares in lieu of actual acting which quickly becomes tedious. Noni Hazelhurt also relies on a repetitive combination of facial and verbal stammering techniques but combines them with just enough acting to render them less irritating. Aaron Pedersen is so wooden, he just seems to be reading his lines as fast as he can off the page.... absolutely no acting involved at all. Daniel McPherson, Damien Richardson, Shane Bourne and Terry Jarvis form the core that make the show really worth watching.
The violence became Increasingly more graphic over the course of the two seasons I watched on Prime which was disappointing because I felt they had been successfully conveying the crimes without the need for that. But it was still kept to a minimum compared to other cop dramas although, perhaps quite graphic for the time period.
Overall, it's an enjoyable show with intriguing plots, mostly likable characters and interesting guest stars and an air of realism. They catch the criminals with good ""old-fashioned"" police work and the show isn't bogged down by implausible stunts and car chases. The characters' backstories showed signs of developing at first but that seemed to come to an abrupt halt and only a rare reference to ""Emma"" with nods and smiles in ""Matt's"" direction reminded us that these detectives might actually have lives outside of the office.
The show isn't really ""dated"" given as early as it was produced, but certainly suffers from aspects of it. It reminds me of ""Boone""... definitely enjoyable but just falling short of the mark somehow.",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2021,karenn1,8," Thanks, Aussies, For This Superior Program!
","I was 17 years late to this party, but it bore the years wonderfully. Both character and plot driven, this is a rare gem that will be just as enjoyable a decade from now.",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2020,arrmeen,8," Love this show
","I am glad I came across this hidden gem on Amazon Prime. I am actually addicted to it and yes I am watching it way after it was first aired. This is 2020 and the show still holds its own ,good stories , great characters and actors you can relate to. It's a great watch overall. If you happen to have a smart TV go for this show on either Prime or Tubi it's free what more can you ask.
btw I love Allie Kingston's character ;)",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2021,plasticmask,10," Australians KNOW how to make a GREAT cop drama
","This will be the SECOND time that I've binged this show, the first time having been WELL over a year ago. I'm remembering just barely enough to think ""Oh, right, I remember this little bit"" but they STILL manage to turn me round with the quick bursts of laughter and the endings. ""I didn't recall THAT person being the 'bad guy'!! WOW"" Like that and all. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHOW FOR BINGEING on Hulu (where it can now be found)",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2021,kristanmarieanderson,10," A fantastic cop drama
","This is as good as the best of the cop dramas. Very gripping mysteries each episode, plus the character developments are second to none; Dt Simon Joyner is palpable and hard not to feel in your bones the pain. Kudos to the entire team on this show- directors, casting, writing, acting,...etc.",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2019,lindalpnp,10," One of my favorites. I can't believe I hadn't heard about it before now.
","I started this on Amazon Prime and was not happy they only had two seasons. Luckily, my daughter gets Hulu free with her Spotify account. I'm watching season 3 now and absolutely love it. Why can't the United states figure out how to make a crime series so good? Keep it about the crime and the investigation and not all about the investigators love lives and personal issues maybe?",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2019,cindytiemann,10," Obsessed with this show!
",The show was so good and the character development was amazing It just kept on going and by the way you can watch all five seasons on Hulu I did not want it to end!!!! Ally's character is my absolute favorite. I thought all the stories were really original too,/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2022,kylecurry,10," Excellent show!
","In this show the police actually do investigations the way police actually do investigations. Great characters, very realistic scenarios. I enjoyed this show very much.",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2010,jlgrn,7," CITY HOMICIDE - Slipping?
","I have been a dedicated viewer of ""City Homicide"" for quite some time now. Each week I religiously turn on to Channel Seven and prepare to enjoy an episode. In the time that I have watched the show, I have come to recognise a gradual progression towards improvement in all areas of production. Recently however, two of the main characters from ""City Homicide"", Shane Bourne, (Daniel Wolfe) and Daniel MacPherson (Simon Joyner), have made a quiet exit beneath the radar so to speak. In their absence, the remainder of the cast have been left to look after the ship. The tight, enthralling episodes that were to be looked forward to each week have been replaced with weak characterless insipid plots featuring the very worst performances from the cast. However, with such tedious scripts being allocated to the actors, who could blame them for being a little lack-lustre? The episode that went to air this evening AEST, Wednesday 6th October, 2010, almost sent me to sleep in the first 10 minutes. I ended up turning it off. The previous episode, a week earlier, had the same effect. I ended up not seeing the conclusion. Please don't get me wrong; I look forward to watching this show each week. But, I'm telling you it ""ain't making it"" at the moment. And if I'm loosing ""my"" interest, I wonder how many others are as well? One other thing; the new detective that has been brought into the show, (can't recall his name at the moment), is obnoxious! The character he plays, or tries to, educated at Oxford, is just so unbelievable. This character is ruining what was becoming a top-notch crime series. Suggestion, recast him in an occasional appearance role as a gay CSI tech. Yes, it would work!",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2021,valstone52,10," Fantastic.
","I love this series all the characters except for the Terry Jarvis role. The actor is just one those type of people you, just don't want to like. He's slimy. The rest of the cast is a great.",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2019,lexingtonvintage,10," Well written, directed and acted program
","Australia does it again with this fantastic show. I am so glad I clicked on it because it is now in my top 10 crime/police procedurals. It is great to see so many Aussie and Kiwi guest stars early in their careers. One episode had The lead actor of the Dr Blake Mysteries as a guest, and he was in lots of scenes with the detective who eventually played his wife in the show.",/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2019,barbbattaglia,10," Excellent series!

7 December 2021,cherub32169-879-61941,4," Just mediocre.
",Pretty unimpressive. There's no depth to it and just not engaging at all. It's sort of over dramatic and the acting is pushed too hard. Cheesy music too.,/review/rw7623886/?ref_=tt_urv
