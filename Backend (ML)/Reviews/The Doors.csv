12 January 2008,ElijahCSkuggs,10," The New Indiana Jones
","Naughty Dog seriously knows how to make games. I'm a gigantic fan of the Jak and Daxter games, well besides Jak Racing...or whatever that was called. But the platforming/action trilogy of Jak and Daxter are fantastic games. You probably already know that Naughty Dog is also responsible for the mega-hit Crash Bandicoot. Unfortunately I was addicted to Mortal Kombat at the time so I never played any of the Crash games. Well, just like their brethren in Insomniac games, Naughty Dog can also make other games, besides the platforming stuff. Uncharted: Drakes Fortune is an all-out blast to play, and easily one of the best games on the PS3 and the video game market as a whole.",/review/rw1931162/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2020,awwplutto,8," A great start to a great franchise!
","Bad graphics compared to now, but overall a good game! This is my least favorite of the series but this is not at all a bad game, just not the best! A great story! My order of the game from best to worst:",/review/rw1931162/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2008,djrussell,," Indiana Jones, Tomb Raider and Gears of War in one!
","I don't like to use the word ""clone"", cause Uncharted is far from being a clone of anything. Its almost in a genre of its own... but as I try to explain to people it is a combination of three famous series: Indiana Jones, Tomb Raider and Gears of War. It has elements from all three of those, rolled into one, which in term brew's up the sweetest dish; Uncharted: Drake's Fortune.",/review/rw1931162/?ref_=tt_urv

","The fact that I was fifty times better at ""The Last of Us"" indicates how much Naughty Dog has improved since it made this game. There is far too much annoying jumping and balancing on ledges. Sometimes there is no real rhyme or reason behind the direction of the jumps or just how you're supposed to make them. Sometimes the game just wants you to press super hard on the direction and jump button. In other words, the controls are god awful. ",/review/rw1931162/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2009,jesusisdeceit,9," Uncharted Is A Wonderful Achievement in Gaming
","Uncharted is an action/adventure game from developer Naughty Dog, and is simply a major achievement in gaming. Simply put, this game will blow you away. To delve into it a bit more, this game offers a plethora of action, adventure, and engaging characters. The voice acting is far and beyond anything in a game thus far, and the characters are just likable. The story is pretty basic for adventure, with some interesting details; but if you ever liked an Indiana Jones film, this is right up your alley. The action is top notch and strategy is a must when playing tougher difficulty levels. The AI is great and there's never a lack of objects to hide behind, enemies to sneak up on, or open areas to run into blazing. The adventure gives another dimension to game, constantly searching for the next cliff to hang onto, the next rope to swing from, and a total of 60 treasures to collect. It's really a blast to go jumping from place to place, climbing and swinging. You can hang on edges and cliffs while throwing grenades to deter enemies or shoot with precision. Don't pass this gem up.",/review/rw1931162/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2009,sashank_kini-1,8," Great game
","I would not say that Uncharted is one of the greatest games of all time but there are moments in the game that makes one go wow! The Indiana Jones-like action game is packed with plenty of punch, or rather gun-fights since most of the times one is indulged in that.",/review/rw1931162/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2021,Analog_Devotee,8," Awesome!
","The beginning to a legendary franchise. I don't play games as much as I used to, but I still sit down and marathon 1 - 3 every couple of years or so. These games are just so darn addicting. And, man, how about the storyline and memorable characters? Superb!",/review/rw1931162/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2007,Aaron1375,8," Kind of a cross between Tomb Raider Legends and Gears of War.
","I liked this game for the most part, but I was hoping for something a bit more original, however, if you have played the two games listed above then this is not going to be anything new game play wise. However, it makes up for it by having a rather good story, and I did enjoy the game play in said two games. Just to warn you though, I was cussing at certain parts of the game and I had it set to easy. The story, typical search for the treasure scenario as Nathan and his buddies are after a treasure sought by Sir Francis Drake. You have your typical bad guys and you have numerous shoot outs, which is one of the problems I had with this game. There are two many go here then to the next screen all basic shootouts. These shootouts get annoying, especially when the enemy is seemingly dead on all the time. I just wish with all the advances in gaming they could dumb down the enemy a bit. I can't stand it when you get locked on immediately, it would be nice if for once the enemy would lose sight of you at times as that would be more realistic. The exploring is straight out of Tomb Raider Legends and fun for the most part, and then there is the end which spiced things up with strange things to kill, things that would seem more in place in a horror survival game than in this setting. Still, it was fun, the ending was good and I could see playing another game featuring these characters again. Next time I hope they work on the hand to hand more as you just did not get a lot of opportunity to really use it much.",/review/rw1931162/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2020,franciscojavy11,7," A promising first game.
",Gonna play through all the uncharted games. This one was decent definitely the best thing about it was the characters. Gameplay although a bit repetitive it was still fun. Story was good but there's a whole lot of potential for more. Hope the next one doesn't dissapoint.,/review/rw1931162/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2018,joshjkkemp,3," not nearly as good as other reviews say
","This game is not very good. The room after room of instantly spawning enemies just gets so tiresome that you are either glad to see something to do other than shoot everything, or too bored to really care. Sometimes that change is worse than the constant shooting. Most notably the jet ski bit where you are stuck going slow on a hi speed vehicle, which can barely turn or reverse, through narrow corridors with plenty of right angle turns to shoot sea mines and more bad guys with the only weapon with infinite ammo, a slow grenade launcher. Some enemies just get placed up on pillars with no way up too, so a melee attack is all but worthless assuming you could get close enough to use it. Constantly getting reset to 2 weapons is just infuriating. This mechanic has ultimately devalued every weapon since you don't even get to keep anything you have.The only real feeling of being Indiana Jones like is in the beginning before constant shooting actually happens, where you are going through ruins and find an old Nazi plane. Though that gets forgotten about in the first 10-15 minutes.",/review/rw1931162/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2013,CuriosityKilledShawn,8," Fortune and Glory, kid
","The globe-trotting adventurer is a familiar character, especially in video games. Lara Croft had her heyday between her first outing in 1996 and the last, terrible, game in 2008. The time was ripe was a new hero to take over and Nathan Drake certainly fits the bill. A descendant of Sir Francis Drake, Nathan has adventure in his blood and is determined to unravel the mystery of his ancestor's final resting place and discover the lost city of El Dorado. It's a well-worn plot, but the jovial Talespin-esque approach and likable characters keep it fresh and exciting.",/review/rw1931162/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2012,domtaylor,10," Great game!
","Even though I am writing this in 2012,this game dosen't get old.I'll try not to compare it to the others(which could be good in some ways)but I'll do that now: This game feels more fresh than the other later two and the story,although shorter, seems not cleverer but better in some ways. Uncharted:Drakes Fortune is a great game which can challenge you at some points.The shootouts get you on the edge of your seat and the climbing and adventure points are good too. This game,although with slightly repetitive gameplay,Is fantastic and makes you think. This is a must buy for all those action/adventure game lovers!",/review/rw1931162/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of the first experiences I had with my PlayStation 4, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune still holds up nicely. Combat-wise, this game has its flaws. The amount of weapons is laughably low, the cover system is unfavourable, and its melee combat feels and looks like something out of a cheesy 80's movie. But on the topic on movies, this game's narrative is great enough to rival one. It tells the most grounded story of any Uncharted game, and while it does have a laughably anticlimactic resolution, all-in-all, it's pretty good. It establishes the main cast of the game well, featuring the great dialogue and wonder voice acting that the series is praised for. The game, for something made in 2007, looks pretty good. A few wow moments do exist, but, even with the remaster, this won't hold up to any AAA game this generation. The music is decent, although it did include the iconic Nate's Theme, a song re-used in every ensuing game in the series. The climbing is pretty smooth, although the controls feel slightly clunky and rigid. Overall, this game is worth a shot for the story and unforgettable characters, but also worth a shot for the far superior sequels that followed.",/review/rw1931162/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2021,AvionPrince16,6," Good start
","A video game clearly inspired by tomb raider but with new elements of gameplay that make the game pretty unique. The story was classic and we already seen it. It have some charistmatic characters, love story and quiet good gun fights and exploration and it was quite entertaining and enjoyable. Pretty good overall.",/review/rw1931162/?ref_=tt_urv

","The graphics and acting is great and the story is very basic but I can't say it's bad. Other than that the game is very bad, it has extremely clunky, repetitive and boring combat, the environments are all just uncreative abandoned stone temples/villages or jungle (for the most part). The ""parkour"", or whatever it is called, is very basic and the same could be said for the puzzles.",/review/rw1931162/?ref_=tt_urv
