22 November 2005,Snoopymichele,10," And The Oscar Goes To......
","Wow, what a film. I had been waiting to see this movie since I read that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were cast in the lead roles. I was not sure what to expect when I heard they were going to do their own singing, but was I ever impressed. Their performances in this movie were brilliant, and I had chills down my spine. It was truly amazing how much Phoenix sounded like Johnny Cash-this was a role he was born to play, and he was mesmerizing. Totally sizzling. Witherspoon was positively radiant as June Carter, and talk about chemistry between the two actors. Talk about lightning striking! I only hope they are rewarded for their efforts come Oscar time. This was a truly amazing movie, filled with great music, a top-notch supporting cast and a terrific script which was wonderfully directed.",/review/rw2497200/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2005,hollingsworth76,8," worthy of its subject matter, truthful
","Whenever I see so much ""Oscar worthy"" tags/blurbs in an ad campaign I get nervous, see Cinderella Man. Usually you look closely at the fine print and see that the esteemed critic lauding the film is Joe Schmoe from the One Stop Light Bugle Press in Buttcreek, Illinois or a low level flunky who just happens to work for the media conglomerate that is distributing the film. So my heart sank a little when a film I have been eagerly awaiting was swaddled with such praise when the ads hit the air.",/review/rw2497200/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2005,radioriot,9," Great film
","Considering the formula junk coming out of Hollywood these days, I was blown away by how good this movie was. The direction was perfect. Using close ups to get us in under the skin of Johnny Cash. And since it was a period piece, he could have bored us with lots of cgi of Memphis and L.A. to take us back in time. Instead he used the actors and the music to take us there. Biopics naturally have a formula to them, but the director and screenwriter did not take us down the track of overly sentimental scenes. These were real and done with a bit of well placed humor. Just like real life. Afterall you still have to follow the real lives of Johnny and June. You can't make it up, just to be original! The movie was also a movie you can take most of the family to. No nudity and sex to SHOW how in love they are, just real dialog...it's nice to hear REAL dialog and not just another chase scene, or four letter word. Yes, some movies need that to tell the story, this one doesn't. This movie goes onto my short list of great biopics, with ""Ray"". Not much else comes close to Ray or Walk the Line. The true test of any biopics is: can you still understand the plot even if you never heard of the people the movie is about. This movie is a great love story even if you never heard of Johnny and June Cash. Oscars all around I say! Plus I loved the Rockabilly music through out the movie.",/review/rw2497200/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2005,hemphill-1,10," the best film of 2005
","I've long thought that James Mangold was one of the most underrated American directors; while other acclaimed auteurs like Wes Anderson and David Gordon Green have made names for themselves by essentially repeating themselves with each film, Mangold has attracted considerably less attention for actually having the gall to show some range. Like the great directors of the Hollywood studio system, Mangold shows visual and narrative skill across a wide array of genres: character-driven crime (COPLAND); horror (IDENTITY); issue-oriented drama (GIRL INTERRUPTED), etc. What each of these films shares in common is a stunningly elegant and expressive visual style, an attention to character reminiscent of Renoir, and an economy of storytelling that would make Howard Hawks envious.",/review/rw2497200/?ref_=tt_urv

","I absolutely loved it. More my dad's music than mine (I was born in 1960-am a rock-n-roller), but tapped my feet the whole way thru. It is funny, I grew up with certain songs of Johnny Cash, and heard about the legend of the ""man in black"" for as long as I remember, but this movie adds a whole new dimension to the man, his music. I think it's great maybe a whole new generation might come to enjoy his contributions too.",/review/rw2497200/?ref_=tt_urv

12 October 2006,PizzicatoFishCrouch,8," Toe-tappingly good fun.
","Before watching this film, I had my doubts. Johnny Cash is one of my favourite country singers, nay, singers of all time, and I was unsure as whether, as with other mediocre biopics, namely the flashy Ray, could do him enough justice. As it turned out, Johnny gets the film he deserves, and, what's more, Walk the Line got me extremely interested in the work of his wife, June Carter Cash.",/review/rw2497200/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2020,Xstal,6," Great Performances, Tedious Story...
","Some truly great acting, especially from Joaquin Phoenix but it's a tedious and repetitive account of a pill popping alcoholic with serious psychological issues. If you're a fan of the man and his music it may mean a bit more but I just got fed up of watching the same sub-plot continually repeating carousel - hard work, difficult to like and challenging, just like the protagonist.",/review/rw2497200/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2005,lreilert,10," Excellent
","Walk the Line is a great movie. When you watch it, you feel as though you are watching Johny Cash in person. Juaqin Pheonix is amazing as Cash, a man with so many regrets and self doubts. Reese Witherspoon gives an Oscar performance as the love of his life June Carter. The film is long, but worth every minute. But what is great is that T Bone Burnett chose the right songs to play. When I saw it today people in the theater were singing along with the movie. And what is great, is that Pheonix and Witherspoon sand the songs themselves. This movie should win several Oscars this year. Go see it. It is an amazing film, and it perfectly protrays an amazing man.",/review/rw2497200/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," Superb
","I do like biopics a lot, I find them interesting, and not only was Walk the Line interesting, it was also truthful and compelling. The cinematography and editing are top notch, and the costumes/clothes and location work are nigh on perfect with a real sense of elegance about them. The songs and music are absolutely wonderful, the script is of exceptional quality, the story is well paced and easy to get into and the direction is excellent. And to top it all, the characters are portrayed in a truthful and sincere manner, while Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon for my mind give career-best performances. In conclusion, a superb film and out of the movies of 2005 only Brokeback Mountain beats it. 10/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2497200/?ref_=tt_urv

24 August 2020,perica-43151,10," Excellent biopic of a great artist
","Johnny Cash has quite a few things in common with the actor who plays him in this movie. This is a worthy portrayal of the great American singer-songwriter, a man who was always on the side of the downtrodden and those who, like himself, were tortured souls. The music is pretty faithfully reproduced, and the movie is measured, dignified and entertaining. This is a fascinating and authentic film about a fascinating and authentic person.",/review/rw2497200/?ref_=tt_urv

","Watching this movie yesterday couldn't help but remind me, in a number of respects. to ""Ray,"" a film out a year earlier. Both were biographies of singers of a similar era, the main difference between the color of their skin, Ray being Ray Charles, of course, and this movie about Johnny Cash.",/review/rw2497200/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2005,filmfan75,7," Great performances make this worth checking out
","I don't know about ""Mangold the Auteur"", and might need a bit more proof that this is really a director worth paying attention to, but this is a pretty watchable film. I found the story and film-making a bit predictable, like the usual bio-pic formula that you might expect if you've seen, say, coal miner's daughter, or any other bio-pic of someone you love. What makes this movie stand out is the two lead performances. Reese is unbelievably convincing as June Carter Cash. She almost disappears into the role. And her singing! Who knew???

2 March 2006,gradyharp,5," Much Ado Over Not Very Much
","Rarely has a biopic film made such a racket at the box office. After viewing the DVD version of WALK THE LINE the reasons for that success must be attached to some sort of homage to Johnny Cash, an American icon of sorts. Yes, his life and career are notable - the emergence of a legendary Country Western singer out of the elements of a warped childhood peaked by the accidental death of his older brother whom the father clearly preferred, and the torture of self doubt that haunted a man through an unsuccessful marriage and a thwarted love for fellow Country Western singer June Carter, his descent into alcohol and drugs, and his final victory over his demons - but isn't this the same story we see almost annually about famous stars whose backgrounds seem templates from this same mold? Joaquin Phoenix is a fine actor and has the courage to take on a variety of roles, succeeding in them all. And yes, he was able to sound like Johnny Cash (given the fact that even Cash's fans will admit it was not a voice of quality but of message). Much the same could be said for Reese Witherspoon's tackling successfully the equally mediocre quality voice of June Carter - again it was her sassy style that made her a star, not her voice. And perhaps that is the reason the writers and director elected to spend most of the screen time on the singing and concerts of Cash and Carter - leaving very little of the story of Cash's life except to outline form between songs.",/review/rw2497200/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2007,Danusha_Goska,8," Phoenix Mesmerizing in a Raw Portrait of Masculine Power and Vulnerability
","""Walk the Line"" is a good movie, but what makes it well worth going out of your way for, even if you are not a country music or Johnny Cash fan, is Joaquin Phoenix's raw, mesmerizing performance of masculine power and vulnerability. Phoenix deserved the Academy Award for this performance, and more.",/review/rw2497200/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2005,jotix100,8," Johnny Cash and June Carter a wonderful combination!
","The 1950s was an important period for the popular music that was being created in this country. It was the decade that brought forth the likes of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, June Carter, Patsy Cline, Bob Dylan and the rest of those innovators that sent the popular music of that era to the stratosphere. The music was created by poor rural people that grew up hearing the blues and gospel music in church and at home. The white music stars stole shamelessly from the black artists they admired, but because of the racial climate in the land, they had no chance to make it as big as the white performers.",/review/rw2497200/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2006,claudio_carvalho,9," What a Story!
","I have never been a fan of Johnny Cash (Joaquinm Phoenix), therefore I have not followed his career; but the story of his life is really an excellent theme for a movie. There are drama, rejection, music, drugs, romance and love. The screenplay begins when he was a boy, being raised very close to his brother Jack in a cotton farm in Arkansas; the tragic death of Jack in an accident with a saw, generating a process of rejection of his father; the period in the air force in Germany; his wedding with his sweetheart and the financial difficulties of the beginning of his marriage; his success with music, touring with Jerry Lee Lewis, June Carter, Elvis Presley, and Carl Perkins, and becoming addicted in pills; his fall in the world of drugs, causing the end of his marriage; his passion for June Carter (Reese Witherspoon); his raise, with the support of June, with a concert for the inmates at Folsom Prison in California; and his proposal of marriage to June on stage in Ontario. In addition to the wonderful screenplay, the stunning performance of this great actress Reese Witherspoon deserved the Oscar of Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role. Last but not the least, the wonderful songs are fantastic. My vote is nine.",/review/rw2497200/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2009,darin-wissbaum,4," What a let down...
",This film was a bit overrated. I don't know how you feel but Jouquin Phoenix was mis-cast for the role of Johnny Cash. I kept watching the film hoping to become convinced of his performance of Johnny and it never happened. The film does seem to follow Johnny's early life as a performer and the Folsom Prison concert well enough but it never really seemed to work for me. Every one was over acting and the singing by Phoenix was sub-par. I don't know I just think this film could have been made better with another actor playing the part of Cash. Maybe this was the point in Phoenix's life when he started going a bit nuts...I don't know. I just think this tribute to Johnny kind of sucked...,/review/rw2497200/?ref_=tt_urv

","Joaquin Phoenix deserved an Oscar for his portrayal, but it was just his bad luck. Not only did he have to compete against Phillip Seymour Hoffman, but also against the fact, that one year earlier Jamie Foxx had won an Academy Award for the portrayal of Ray Charles ... two Oscars in a row for playing in a biopic about a musicians life? Not a chance, although it would've been more than appropriate.",/review/rw2497200/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2011,classicsoncall,9," ""We're all going to hell for the songs we sing.""
","I was somewhat apprehensive when I heard this film was being made with Joaquin Phoenix in the lead, along with Reese Witherspoon portraying June Carter. It's best to have an open mind about these things, and quite honestly, they both did a terrific job representing these legends of country music. The movie delves into Cash's early career, roughly the first decade or so following his youth, military service and first marriage. What I particularly enjoyed was seeing how the careers of other legendary singers and musicians paralleled Johnny's own - folks like Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and Roy Orbison. If true, the sequence showing producer Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts) inspiring Cash to sing what he knows and feels was a true turning point in Johnny's life, one that might easily have gone an entirely different direction had their paths not crossed.",/review/rw2497200/?ref_=tt_urv
