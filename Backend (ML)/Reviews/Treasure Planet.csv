25 May 2022,mark.waltz,8," Doubt will make you think. Both the movie and the emotion.
","The film version of the John Patrick Shanley play for me shows the best performance of Meryl Streep in the 21st century. As the very strict sister Aloysius, the principal at a Bronx Catholic school, it is her job to make the children fear her and tow the line, and even in Sunday mass, she is not one to avoid stepping up and discipline them. Being sent to her office is worse than a prison sentence, because her cold stare and hard words of discipline will cut the victim to the quick. Haven't been to Catholic schools in grade school, dealing with a principal like this would lead to nightmares for me, especially after watching the witch in ""The Wizard of Oz"". The nuns in the school do not wear the traditional habits, but long black flowing Cape like dresses and bonnets instead of wimples. Sister Aloysius is the only one with this type of coldness in the school. The younger nuns, particularly the one played by Amy Adams, are warm and discipline only when they need to, and the older nuns are sweet and grandmotherly. But as the audience learns later, Sister Aloysius came late to the convent, a war widow with a lot of bitterness attached to her life.",/review/rw2044266/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2009,Chrysanthepop,," The Power Of Doubt
",'Doubt' has turned out to be quite a fascinating puzzle. The story is pretty much told through dialogue rather than portrayal of events. Shanley's overwhelming screenplay is so effective and the element of mystery is carried out so strongly that even the viewer is left doubting the actions of the priest and the motives of the head nun (were her accusations legitimate or was it all an intent to ruin the priest). His incredible direction takes us through the psyche of the four principle characters.,/review/rw2044266/?ref_=tt_urv

","According to a report commissioned by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, over four thousand clerics were accused of sexual abuse during the past fifty years. Although approximately thirty percent of these accusations were not investigated because they were unsubstantiated, given the proclivity of the bishops to cover up these incidents, the figures are widely suspected to be underestimated. What may be lost in the discussion of statistics about sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, however, is an understanding of the humanity of the people involved or the complexities of the circumstances.",/review/rw2044266/?ref_=tt_urv

31 August 2009,manxman-1,10," Absolutely riveting!
","Wow! Incredible performances from Meryl Streep and Philip Seymore Hoffman. Mesmerizing intensity from Streep as the nun seeking to find Hoffman guilty of a sin he may or may not have committed. Amy Adams gives a sincere performance as the nun who sets the ball rolling with her suspicions that Hoffman may have molested a black student. The scenes between Streep and Hoffman crackle with intelligence and frightening intensity. Streep, as the unrelenting figure of justice, determined at any cost to destroy Hoffman, is terrifying and unrelenting. Hoffman gives a performance less restrained and mannered than the one he gave in Capote (and won the Oscar for) and boy, does he ever deserve to have won a second one for this outing. An absolute knockout, nuanced and convincing in every way. What a masterful performance! John Patrick Shanley's script is riveting from start to finish. If anyone has any doubts about watching this movie due to the theme then put those doubts aside as the writing and acting are without doubt amongst the finest ever committed to film. A superb piece of work.",/review/rw2044266/?ref_=tt_urv

That's what Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) says to Sister James (Amy Adams) in attempting to explain her superior's behavior by accusing him of molesting an altar boy. At this point the confrontation between Flynn and Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) hasn't taken place yet, but you know it will.

","It's a fine movie, made for adults. Meryl Streep is the principal of a Catholic school. She's not sadistic but is pretty curmudgeonly and runs the place like Parris Island. Streep takes a dislike to a newly arrived priest, Philip Seymour Hoffman, whom she deems too friendly towards the polished and well-groomed students. She also is offended because Hoffman uses a ball point pen, takes three lumps of sugar in his tea, and has longer fingernails than she thinks proper.",/review/rw2044266/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2012,gooelf50,8," I still have doubts
","This was the most unsettling movie I have seen in many years. Throughout the showing I found myself wandering back and forth between condemnation of the Priest's behaviour, the Principal's behaviour and the behaviour of the young black student's Mother. The part of the traditional nun who is principal of a Catholic School is played perfectly by Meryl Streep. She's unhappy with change and views it almost as a loss of the comfort and peace of mind that comes with tradition. The part of the new Priest is played just as perfectly by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He views change in the way religion is practiced as absolutely essential and wants to see the iron fisted traditional rule of the principal disappear into the dark, inflexible past where it belongs. Thus, from the beginning of the movie there is a silent war between the two main characters. If you are a trusting and positive person, you may find yourself believing that the new priest is a wonderful man who cares about nothing more than the religious health and happiness of the parishioners and young students of his church. The affection that he displays for the troubled young black student at the centre of the controversy is touching and absolutely appropriate. On the other hand, if you are a more cynical person, likely to be suspicious of any behaviour that strays from the reserved understanding that a priest traditionally expresses in a more sombre way to his parishioners and students, then you may quickly decide that he is all of the things that the principal suspects him to be. In the end, the principal wins out and succeeds in driving the new priest out of the parish. He moves on to another parish where he has greater responsibilities and enjoys a higher level of professional respect. But I, the viewer, am left wondering if the principal is a paranoid cast back to 17th century religious practices, who victimizes a new priest simply because he represented change that she wasn't prepared to accept, or if the new Priest actually is an abuser who took advantage of a young vulnerable boy who had no one to turn to for comfort, but was ferreted out by a wise, no nonsense adherent to purity in religion.",/review/rw2044266/?ref_=tt_urv

25 August 2009,Hitchcoc,9," Incredible Acting
","This is a movie filled with memorable scenes. It really captures the Catholic private school milieu of the sixties. The nuns run the school and are overseen by a priest, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Things are a bit harsh, but deliberately so. Meryl Streep plays the principal of the school and is on a continuous campaign to keep the new wave of education reform out of her school. She becomes suspicious of the priest when he takes interest in the only black child in the school. She becomes particularly obsessed when the boy is called out of class for private council. This was in the pre-catholic priest as pedophile days, but it really strikes a chord today. What we are involved with is Streep's acting on her suspicions, coming from a possession of weakness (though she is not weak) as her role relates to the church. She is determined to get him, though she has no hard evidence. This isn't a big movie with flashy events. It takes place behind closed doors. One of the strongest characters in the movie is the boy's mother, who is called in to talk with the principal. There is a scene that will be viewed as one of the best and most real I've ever witnessed. Everyone has their A-game going here. This is an actor's movie.",/review/rw2044266/?ref_=tt_urv

When the naive Sister James (Amy Adams) raises suspicious against the progressive and charismatic Father Brendan Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to Sister Beauvier, believing that he might have made advances against the needy and only black student in the school, the prepotent nun begins a campaign to step the priest aside the parochial church, distrusting his explanations and without any evidence against him.

28 March 2009,Otoboke,," Free to interpretation of each who sits down to observe.
","Doubt, as it is most commonly known in its many manifestations and  forms, is often antagonised as a weakness, or a fault in virtue. Yet,  somewhat dubiously overlooked is its antithetic counterpart who comes  in the form of belief, faith, conviction, or unwavering assertion.  Indeed, how far will a person tread down a road guided only by their  intuition and trust in faith alone? These questions which in turn  reflect and pave way for many of Doubt's most potent and engaging  moments of narrative, are of course brought up in the course of the  adapted play's screenplay, but they are not answeredat least, not  directly.  In fact, rather ironically, doubt is a feature that places the pieces  of the moral puzzle in question upright onto the table, and then leaves  them there; dangling and free to interpretation of each who sits down  to observe. This somewhat open-ended, vague and subjective form of  cinematic expression is something that is rarely seen outside of art  houses and the most daring of film-makers palettes. And yet  director/writer and playwright John Patrick Shanley implements the  risky move here with ease and grace. Yet the real flavour, despite  having plenty of potency within these realms, lies outside of debating,  suspicions and tests of virtuefirst and foremost, doubt is a study of  human characters, and how they can often clash as a result of their  diversities in opinions and temperaments.  The majority of Doubt's story then is central to three catalysts for  the script's themes to manifest and evolve. These three personas come  in the form of a reserved, progressively adapted priest by the name of  Brendan Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman); a young, bright-eyed newcomer  nun named Sister James (Amy Adams); and a stern, assertive and  conniving traditionalist nun named Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep).  While it would be of no fault of anyone to assume that the themes I  have mentioned thus far have everything and all to do with the question  of religious faith only, this tangent however relevant and vital to the  backdrop of the story, nevertheless serves as just thata backdrop.  Instead Doubt takes its intellectual conflict between heart and reason  in the form of a cloudy event involving father Flynn and a young  alter-boy who takes a certain liking to the father-like-figure of the  priest. After hearing a notably unsure and reserved report from Sister  James, Sister Beauvier asserts that she knows what is going on with  Flynn, and that she's going to set everything straight.  But what then, is her evidence? Not much. In fact, aside from word of  mouth (gossip, you could decree) from a young, naïve woman not sure  even of her own words, Beauvier has nothing but her suspicion and  conviction to go on. From here on in then, it is the sole intent of the  director to address the themes of doubt itself, and its oppressor,  being the Absolute Truth, or so it is perceived by those who take heed  of its obvious presence. How Shanley delivers his story is nothing  short of engrossing however; the whole structure of the play sees  characters sway from one end of the moral spectrum to the otherindeed,  it's startling as a viewer to find such palpitating changes of heart  regarding characters.  Sure enough, the whole affair comes across as overtly manipulative  because of the amount of ambiguity and twists and turns that Shanley  throws out there, but taken in context of the movie's themes of  mistrust, unfaltering conviction and the inability for compassionate  re-evaluation, Doubt reflects its ideas in the head of its viewer  without blatantly pointing out such shifts; the emotional tugs are  indeed obvious, but the strings pulling them, are not.  Yet for all intents and purposes, Doubt exists as a fine testament not  only to Shanley's ability as a film-maker, but also his ability to  direct his cast, and to allow them to envelop the characters from  within his emotionally contorted monster. Taking forefront for obvious  reasons here are both Hoffman and Streep who deliver performances just  as convincing and engaging as their characters are written. Hoffman  himself has seen a vast array of roles (specifically from 2008) which  have made him a figure to watch from here on in, but Streep, despite  her accolades from previous years, has found herself in some lacklustre  roles as of late. Doubt then, with its rich, multi-dimensional  characters and interpersonal relations, finds Streep back at home,  embodying her persona with vigour and a conviction that always finds  the audience clamouring at her feet, but not at the expense of  maintaining their attention.  It's a somewhat humble, unassuming feature as a whole that will be  easily misinterpreted by a few, but only a few. Instead, those looking  for intelligent, layered and tangible character drama laced with plenty  of thematic conjecture will find much to enjoy here. Of course, there  is every reason to believe that the feature's lack of resolution or  clear, objective stances will disgruntle those dimmed into expectations  of cathartic, solidified resolvesbut this in turn is the point of  Doubt. Not only does it offer up food for thought, intrigue the heart  and question the nature of our own convictions we may hold dear, but it  also echoes those themes through its unavoidably ambiguous and  unknowing nature.  One thing that certainly is clear here however, is that Doubt exists as  a complex, significant feature, brimming with subdued, nuanced life and  important statements beyond which most cinematic fare avoids in favour  of comfortable, solidified answers; it's a bold statement, and an  endlessly intriguing and engrossing one at that.",/review/rw2044266/?ref_=tt_urv
