24 September 2019,Br4ve-trave1or,9," Not what your expecting in a good way! Bourdain would have loved this!
","With short a short synopsis, I delayed watching this show until very recently. After reading 'Kitchen Confessions', by the late great Anthony Bourdain (Parts Unknown on CNN), I asked myself, how come there's such a huge void for series offering a raw authentic view behind the scenes in the kitchen life? Other than the movie Burnt starring Bradley Cooper and the first season and done AMC series starring Ross from friends, I don't recall great content filling this void.",/review/rw5351385/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2018,Denovot,4," as exciting as a well done steak...
","I decided to give this a shot after seeing constant ads, also being a New Yorker with some experience in fine dining I was interested enough. Unfortunately there were so many glaring issues with this adaptation. The most frustrating part is there are glimmers of what could've been a great show throughout, opportunities squandered at every turn. 
One of the main issues is our star, Tess. It's hard to distinguish if it's mainly the fault of the writer, director or actor, but all three do their fair share to poison the pot. I get they are going for doe-eyed naivety but come on, give the audience a little credit, or the character some dimension. Everything, I mean everything she looks at she's gawking as if she has just discovered there are other humans on this planet- get's old real quick. Not to mention it's just not believable. NO ONE with her behavior (won't even discuss lack of experience) would last a day in that industry. However, I'm more than willing to suspend belief for plot but this show doesn't deliver the goods. The show does not give you any reason to root for her success except that she is the obvious protagonist and well, I guess you just should. She isn't particularly hard working or respectful, she walks around in a self absorbed bubble the entire season. For a coming of age there is little, if any personal growth exhibited on her end. 
All of the secondary characters are painfully one note. The season would have been more interesting had they paid more attention to some of them or even made it an ensemble show, as following wide eyed Tess around all day gets tiring. Then there's oh-so-troubled-Jake and I'm-so-illusive Simone. They both seem to have these massive fronts to feign the audience into intrigue, but I'm guessing not much is behind either door. There was no resolution into the season long tension within the 3 or insight into their motivations. The writers either didn't have answers or are holding out hope for a second season, either way not much happens in the first season besides the answer to if Tess will become a permanent hire. 
Luckily it's a short watch and they didn't milk this plot for a longer run time. I may even give it a chance if it gets renewed, hoping they juice up the writing, flesh out the ensemble and someone slaps that look off of Tess's face.",/review/rw5351385/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2019,miaharpr,7," Good guilty pleasure
","I just watched this to pass the time, but I thought it was intriguing enough and found myself finishing the first season. It has the sweetness of a chick flick and the bitterness of an angsty indie film. The main actress is very beautiful and she is captivating to watch. The supporting actors played their parts well. It leaves me feeling empty watching it...there's something sad about the atmosphere of the show...but at the same time it has a dream-like quality about it that makes me long for it. The only thing I don't like about it is how angry or tired of life everyone is, but I think that's what the show wants to evoke. I do look forward to season 2 and more character and storyline development. And I do crave the show.",/review/rw5351385/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2018,lectureral,7," Slight but quite promising
","A familiar story of a young girl heading to the big city to find herself and grow a personality. Ella Purnell is the sweet girl who has not yet revealed the bitter but shows hints of a steel core. She is taken on to train at Howard's (Paul Sparks - last seen in Waco) posh restaurant and her future family (one guesses) is there in the kitchen and front of house. Speaking as a former restaurant manager, she is given a surprising amount of freedom as a probationer (scoffing oysters in the cold store while quaffing champagne?) but I guess that can be called poetic licence.
All told I will be giving it a chance to grow on me.",/review/rw5351385/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2018,whatithinkis,1," I made it through episode 1 . . . barely
","I recognize that this is unique and quite interestingly done . . . BUTTT . . . I found, when confronted with the female lead at the beginning of episode 2, that, while I'd found her annoying in the first episode, now I absolutely could not stand to watch her for one more minute.",/review/rw5351385/?ref_=tt_urv

",This plays on so many cliches of the food industry but they are all true. I relate to all the characters and the scenarios. I think it is well done and I can't wait to see where it goes. I hope people give this show a chance.,/review/rw5351385/?ref_=tt_urv

","We know what bittersweet is, but what is sweetbitter? A taste for seasoned palates, perhaps?

7 June 2018,niccobates,5," Overcooked steak
","Have made it through 3 episodes which I think is a reasonable shot but that's as far as it goes. Careers from one cliche to another. Perhaps in other hands a show set behind the scenes in an upmarket New York restaurant could yield something a little more than on offer here, but then again perhaps not. It looks great but moody lighting and sultry acting isn't enough. A sit com might have worked better with this material or at least a plot with somewhere to go.",/review/rw5351385/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2018,shil0500,10," Very well written & perfectly casted
","WOW!
This has to be the best young adult coming of age story for adventuresome intelligent 20 somethings.
The key word's being intelligent & adventuresome not gaming in mommy & daddy's basement.
The upper end food service industry & the comraderies of friendships to be made makes for a lifetime of memories & sets you up for the challenges of life to come.
There is a reason why 70% of college grads start & end up there, not in their area of education.
Very well written & perfectly casted.
This is a ""GEM"" to be enjoyed over & over.
Thank you for entertaining me & bring back memories of my 20's",/review/rw5351385/?ref_=tt_urv

",I love a show that can make you feel something and this does not disappoint. It's about creating an experience. Feeling and learning new things for the first time and growing into the you that you want to become. Girl in the city working at a sexy restaurant growing into her own. I also love the breakdown of the taste and sexual sensation aspects. Can't wait for more.,/review/rw5351385/?ref_=tt_urv

","But, season 2 episode 1, opening scene was not exciting to watch , why was it necessary to show, then to play around with the severed part of the animal was senseless and spoiled the continued watching of this episode",/review/rw5351385/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2018,leahefti,1," The book is a lot better
","Update: After watching all six episodes of the first season, I have to correct my review from four to one star. This show really lacks depth and sensuality, all the great dialogue and atmosphere stays in the book but doesn't make it to the screen.",/review/rw5351385/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2019,goddardm-79801,7," Binge-worthy but a little too quirky at times
","I managed to watch the entire first season in one day. It was good. Not great. Not terrible. IMO, if you want a fair review of this series, ignore all the one and ten star ratings. They simply are not realistic. It moves a little slow at times but the characters all become likeable in their own way. Never having worked in the food service industry, I can't say how accurately life is portrayed. Most of the characters seem depressed and without hope (and high :) all the time however, so that seems a bit over-played. The one aspect I found exceptionally annoying is how Tess is constantly portrayed as the ""wide-eyed country bumpkin"" stepping foot into the big city for the very first time. It was sort of cute in the first episode. It gets pretty old by the 6th episode. Started Season 2. Seems on-track so far.",/review/rw5351385/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2018,zekeblack,2," Not substantial. Slow dialog, slow action.
","Ummmm. 
A little fluff. Binged the whole thing today. Still didn't feel ""full""
Tess, main character, walks in a dream sequence the whole way through. 
From her IMDb, it says: big eyes. Yeah, and loves the close ups-- I think intended to make her attractive. 
My problem is the cross between the hayseed who bites her nails to blood, and immediately takes any drug she is offered without knowing what it is-- yeah.
We're supposed to believe she's 22, and never met a human being, or learned anything. Fresh to the Big City. Just comes off as not too bright.
I understand the book is so much better.. maybe more satisfying?",/review/rw5351385/?ref_=tt_urv

","Not the lead actress, but coworker....
She's the one we always bully with in the really world restaurant!
Young, fearless, curious for everything, but not smart enough to dominate her job and life, we see these kind of people all the time in the restaurant.
For sure, it's her journey in a big city, fancy restaurant, she will have all kinds of flavor in life, I just finished the first episode, and I can't wait for the next one.",/review/rw5351385/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2019,ScoobySnacks66,8," Sweet, bitter and maybe some salty and umami as well
","This is a great show that simmers slowly and takes its time building the plot and characters over two gorgeously filmed seasons situated primarily in a restaurant modeled after Union Square Cafe in NYC in the early 2000s. It reminds me a bit of the series Felicity with Keri Russell from the late 90s: a shy, beautiful young woman moves to the big city looking to explore all the possibilities life may offer while she slowly discovers who she is and who she really wants to be. It's moody and thoughtful and gives us an accurate look into the life of young servers, bar and kitchen staff working in a high-end, high pressure restaurant. The episodes are only 30 minutes long, so things never get too deep and I think I appreciate this aspect. I can immerse myself a little, get the feeling and the vibe of the time and place and romance of it all; good escapism with a talented cast that serves up courses of relationship drama, intimacy and sex while bringing in well researched and even informational aspects of food and wine. If you enjoy coming of age stories and love food, you'll enjoy all the sweet and bitter this show has to offer.",/review/rw5351385/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2020,millan_07,7," Ambivalent but still a 7 star show.
","Captivating but i don't know why. Maybe its Tess' eyes. Maybe its the weird relationship between Simone and Jake and even Howard. I love the weird likeability that I find myself feeling towards Howard in the second season. Even though I feel like I shouldn't. And there is a lot of ambivalence around a lot of people in this show.
Wish it were more of a ensemble show. Giving me more about everyone and their stories. But mostly. I JUST WANT THE THIRD SEASON!! Da*n you for Canceling this show. Would he or wouldn't he give Simone the boot? I wanna know! Personally I think not. But still interesting enough.
Binged on this show in three days and something kept me wanting more even though I didn't really like it. lol.",/review/rw5351385/?ref_=tt_urv

","The glowing feel of starting a new life in a city. the journey of the story takes you from the life of a Girl who wants to explore the possibilities of finding new opportunities. Struggles through her life to find a place where she is able to learn, explore and enjoy.
the progression is slow, but eagerly anticipating the position she will take for her life, but it will surely come at a cost. that aspect is hidden. even though there is a literary edge to the story, it comes out appealing in nature to see the end of it.
