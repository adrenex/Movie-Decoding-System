9 February 2016,lnvicta,5," We Are Your Friends has a great story, but it's not the direction the movie chose to follow.
","I was expecting to detest this movie, and I'm happy to say that I found some enjoyment in We Are Your Friends. I'm not too big on EDM; I love some of it, dislike most of it, but this movie actually painted the genre/scene in an interesting light. They add a human element to the otherwise processed and compressed music, and it's pretty captivating. At least those scenes are. Where the movie fails can be attributed to its title. We Are Your Friends shouldn't have been about friendship or having each others backs or whatever they were trying to go for because that is by far the weakest element of the movie. Zac Efron is great in the lead role, but his friends are complete throwaway characters. I didn't care about any of them. There is one scene near the end where the friend arc almost pays off, but even then it's not worth all the wasted minutes building up these characters when there's a far more interesting story that's going to waste.",/review/rw3353321/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2015,cosmo_tiger,7," This is not an amazing movie and won't win any awards but I actually liked this much more than I was expecting to.
","""Are we ever gonna be better than this?!"" Cole (Efron) is a DJ trying to make it big, all he needs is ""that one track"". When he meets James (Bently) a DJ that is willing to mentor him he thinks he finally found what he wants. Cole soon finds out that trying meet the expectations of his friends, hiding his romantic feelings, and working on his music isn't as easy as he was hoping for. I was really not looking forward to this at all. I'm not a big Zac Efron fan, nor am I a fan of this type of house music. That being said, I actually liked this more than I expected to. The movie is a little generic and nothing all that special, but there was just something about it that kept me watching and entertained. Efron actually does a pretty good job of portraying what the character is thinking when he is not speaking and only working his board. This is not an amazing movie and won't win any awards but I actually liked this much more than I was expecting to. If you are into this type of sound you will probably like it much more than I did, if you aren't you still may enjoy this like I did. Overall, a surprise of a movie that I liked more than I expected to. I surprisingly give this a B.",/review/rw3353321/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2019,ivans536,7," Don't Listen to the Hate
","A good, fresh movie, obviously geared towards younger generations with a mostly unknown cast and more than competent direction. There are some great sequences in here, with great visuals and graphics, very visually appealing and even informative.",/review/rw3353321/?ref_=tt_urv

28 August 2015,subxerogravity,6," Not as horrible as I was expecting, but still not all that good. Very Neutral
","I went to see the movie because I like another Zac Efon vehicle, That Awkward Moment. The Movie is similar as it's about Efron leading a group of men in their early twenties that really need to grow up, but That Awkward Moment was a hilarious comedy, while We Are Your Friends is more of a satire.

","EDM Music has become a crazy world of drugs, sex and bass drops. Being an avid fan of this genre well before it become a trendy thing to do, I have definitely been a bit disheartened by how kids treat the scene these days. Instead of the focus being on the music, its on being half naked, rolling on E and hooking up with anything with a pulse (that last part is probably optional). This movie shows all of that (of course) but the focus is on doing something MORE with your life. Its about moving people, being memorable and creating from the heart.",/review/rw3353321/?ref_=tt_urv

6 November 2015,Se7en14,4," We are your friends, But We are not a very good movie.
","Zac Efron is definitely becoming a bigger star than we give credit for, he's choosing some great roles and some very unique ones. But why he chose ""we are your friends"" is beyond me. When I first heard of the title being made I was kind of excited as we don't have many movies about DJ's. But unfortunately we get a movie more about clichés than we get about DJs themselves. This movie tries so hard to be something original yet falls into place of other clichéd music movies. Lets mark them down.",/review/rw3353321/?ref_=tt_urv

","Another weekend, another review and this time we are rocking into the theater for yet another youthful drama. Zac Efron leads the cast in the latest film about partying and friendship, in hopes of entertaining the masses in what looks to be some half-baked movie. Yet Hollywood can sometimes surprise you with a masterpiece that will hold a place in your own hall of fame. What is the verdict with this movie? Well sit back, relax and read my thoughts on Max Joseph's We Are Your Friends. ",/review/rw3353321/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2020,TuesdayThe17th,8," Better than they say
","This is a great movie even if it's a bit shallow and disjointed. ""We Are Your Friends"" is about an aspiring DJ who is looking for his big chance, all while navigating the tumultuous lifestyle of pursuing your dreams in LA. This movie is a bit of a coming "" into"" age film but its also a romantic drama, a music film, and a rowdy tale of good friendships... All in one, lol. The director was clearly unsure of his direction as many scenes seem out of place. The vibe is uneven, and there is no flow at all. There are sequences of greatness but it almost comes off as a collection of scenes from a film that could have been much better. Still, though, this movie still has a spark and it resonated nicely with me. I can relate in many ways to Cole and his story is actually kind of compelling. I was intrigued enough to keep wanting to see what comes next. How much worse can it get? When is the point of redemption? This movie would be good for a young man between the ages of 18 and 25 to watch as they may learn a thing or two from it.",/review/rw3353321/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2016,carlos37andre,8," A great new perspective on the music... and friendship.
","Amazing how the film exceeds expectations, expecting at most a movie ""ok"" but is really great. The whole narrative has many virtues, I wonder if you can explain, but the story from one point holds you, I barely saw time pass, the way the issue of music is aborted is excellent, you may find (as well as I thought before seeing): ""It's a film about DJ's, music is not important in the story."" But no! How long is the music is a ""purity"" very cool and also reflects the importance with which the protagonist Cole (Zac Efron) is the same art (music). Moreover, the story is not (only) about teens, parties and cruising, as it may seem (at least for the title that the film won in Brazilian territory), the entire trajectory of the four friends during screen time is excellent too. However, I think the biggest plus point is the script, not that it be complex and innovative, but the film sets out to narrate a certain point there, and does so with praise, almost flawless, is almost, I think the only negative point in all this is how some situations are resolved in ""easy"" way more, are only two situations in which noticed it, but still prevented the note I gave was greater. Zac Efron also (for those who still have some bias) is very good, it can easily ""take"" the film ""back"", going all the depth that (I think) was applied to the character. In short: A great film, airtight script, good soundtrack (yeah, forgot to mention that), and some exciting moments until, at the end of ""We Are Your Friends"" makes a really cool message and fulfills its role, showing a different way of see music.",/review/rw3353321/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2015,CleveMan66,2," If people suggested you go see ""We Are Your Friends"", those people are NOT your friends.
","You've probably heard the admonition: ""Don't peak in high school."" Good advice. It's sad to see someone who you can tell was at their coolest and most accomplished in their teens. Take Zac Efron for example. I've come to wonder if, as an actor, he peaked in the ""High School Musical"" movies. Those productions were mainly inconsequential Disney fluff, but they were fun to watch. Efron has worked steadily ever since (which is more than we can say for most of the other stars from those films) and he has had varying degrees of success with his post-HSM roles (often simply as the brooding hunk). But this is the entertainment business: ""What have you done for me lately?"" He was miscast as a doctor in the otherwise criminally underrated ""Parkland"" (2013) and in 2014, he was just annoying in ""Neighbors"" and in ""That Awkward Moment"" (which lived up to its title – more so, if it were renamed in its plural form). 2015 sees Efron continue to strive for cinematic relevance in the drama ""We Are Your Friends"" (R, 1:36).",/review/rw3353321/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've never seen any actor worse than Zac, yet he keeps making films. That's not it, so far he had failed to take the right project to work with. His films are either having no story or a silly concept and his roles among the worst. I could have liked this film if it was done by some other young actor. It looked a decent storyline on how an aspiring DJ is fighting to make progress. Living with his friends, then suddenly an opportunity knocks and followed by some issues surround it that should be solved to see the success in his passion in the music. So the remaining is to reveal how the things go on for him.",/review/rw3353321/?ref_=tt_urv

","I just saw the film this afternoon. Being A fan of the Genre and lifestyle its based around, I knew what to expect; a generic 'party' film with an interesting story line and enjoyable scenes.Unfortunately, it didn't deliver. I feel like the entire movie was going at 100mph, ensuring plot depth was minimal. I left the theater feeling empty, and as if the story didn't really impact upon me at all or make me think. Like I read in an earlier review, it was very superficial. At the end of the day, It's really just something you go see with a gal to kill some time.

17 January 2016,leonblackwood,4," Average but forgettable! 4/10
","Review: I'm really in two minds about this film because I didn't really find it entertaining but I stuck with it, mainly because I wanted to see were it was going. I'm not really into ""electronic"" music so the whole soundtrack became a bit tedious after a while but the director introduced different elements, which made it watchable. Zac Efron plays an 23 year old, aspiring DJ (Cole Carter), in San Fernando Valley, who lives with his best friend Mason (Jonny Weston). They hold parties with there best friends Ollie (Shiloh Fernández) and Squirrel (Alex Shaffer), on a regular basis but they only make a little profit, which doesn't go that far. Whilst Djing at a night club, Cole gets chatting with an older DJ, James (Wes Bentley), who eventually becomes his mentor and teaches him the in's and out of producing in his lavish studio. They soon build a trusting relationship with each other and Cole takes out James girlfriend, Sophie (Emily Ratajkowski), who he falls head over heels for. After spending a passionate night together, James finds out about there relationship, which breaks his friendship with Cole. After losing his best friend, Squirrel, he pursues his career in producing music and he puts together the perfect record, using natural sounds. He then rebuilds his relationship with James and he headlines a major event, were he debuts his record and rocks the crowd. The director added some emotional elements to make it seem like it wasn't your regular American ""spoilt youths"" type of movie but it still turned out like it. As I'm coming from a Djing background, I could relate to a lot of the concept but I'm used to playing on the underground scene, not to a bunch of rich kids in sunny California. The acting was average and the storyline became a bit predictable after a while. I don't really know what message the director was trying to get across but he done the smart thing by putting Zac Efron in the lead because I doubt that it would have made a profit without him plastered all over the poster. In all, it's a watchable movie but I was left feeling a bit empty when it finished. Average!",/review/rw3353321/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2015,fera_9,4," Nothing special :/
","I watched the premiere last night and I don't have many words to say. It's because the movie left me without any impression. I didn't have any emotions during the whole movie except maybe one scene that had me reminded of my ultra experience. Also, the plot is predictable and it's all kind of superficial. A first half an hour was so boring and then I felt it could go up to the better, but no, the rest was the average even though the action have little changed and a bit of drama was dropped, but not enough good scenes to keep me interested. Movie soundtrack could be much, much better, as well. If you need to kill an hour and a half go watch it, but if you want to see some good movie don't. Maybe a little bit of naked Zac would save the day, but that also did't happen.",/review/rw3353321/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2015,alexislens,10," If you go into the theaters thinking that this movie is mostly about partying then you will be disappointed.
","This movie is mostly focused on these 4 guys in their mid 20s trying to get their lives together without the help of education. It is about more than just the parties, drinking, and sex. You have to take the time to actually open up your mind and pay attention to the small details to really understand this movie. If you want to see a movie strictly about partying go watch ""Project X"". There is a few things you can think about after watching the movie and one of which is ""How far are people willing to go for money"" , ""How hard it is to make it in the big leagues without school"", and ""What do people with money spend their times doing"". These questions all focus on one particular character. After you finish watching the movie you will see. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone!
