10 October 2022,shannonlong636,7," It's not Hill House, Bly, or Midnight Mass.
","The Midnight Club is not really horror. It has horror elements but it's mostly teen drama. If you're expecting a series along the lines of Mike Flanagan's previous Netflix horror series', you may be disappointed. But if you go into it knowing that it's based on young-adult rather than classic literature, perhaps you can appreciate it for what it is. The Midnight Club is based on material by highly successful YA author Christopher Pike, not on classic ghost stories by writers like Shirley Jackson or Henry James.",/review/rw8633476/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2022,designercandlesu,6," Not as good as Bly Manor, Hill House and Midnight Mass
","I loved those three (Hill house, Bly manor and Midnight mass) and have watched each at least 2 - 3 times. This one was boring IMO. I am in episode 6 and already getting annoyed by Ilonka. As others have said, prob will fast forward and skip to the end. Some scary scenes are good, but it is not as gripping as the other previous creations from the writers. It was good to see actors in cameos from their previous work though.",/review/rw8633476/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,ruidanielbarrossss,7," Flanagan's most convoluted show. Some will love it, others not so much.
","Starting with the positives. The main actors, although young, are very good. The dialogue remains mainly intelligent. And as the story takes place in the 90s, there are good moments of nostalgia, especially with the use of music among other easter eggs. Like all of Flanaghan's shows, the horror is in the subtext rather than the focus of the story itself.",/review/rw8633476/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,heidibokor,4," Not Flanagan's Best
","I decided to watch this despite the subpar reviews because Mike Flanagan did such a great job on The Haunting of Hill House and Bly Manor. This was a disappointment for sure. It follows a young group of people who all have terminal diseases and one girls drive to find a cure in what might be a special house. I can say with all honesty the show was pretty pointless. It had such potential, but fell drastically short in every element. You had some jump scares which weren't really scary. There was a mystery to everything which turned out to pretty much be nothing. There were no points to any of the scares, ghosts, and absolutely no point to all the stories the midnight club told. In fact, it got to the point where I fast forwarded all of the dumb stories. And then the show just ended. There was no point to anything! If you are a fan of Flanagan's work, this will disappoint the crap out of you. Skip it and just wait for the Fall of the House of Usher to be released. You will see a few actors that Flanagan likes to use in his shows, but I think it was only a couple.",/review/rw8633476/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,abs-ghosh,5," Disappointment is the only horror in this show.
","I have enjoyed most of Flannagan's work with the Midnight Mass likely being his best offering to date. After watching this show, my opinion hasn't changed. While far from perfect, Flannagan's work genreally posses a fair bit of creativity when it comes to defining ghosts and horrors. His biggest weakness seems to be able to definitely conclude the stories that often borders onto theatrical levels of expositions. Still, in most cases the main story is concluded to a satisfying degree regardless of the expositions. Things have gotten better overtime and I was interested to see if he finally figured out how to make a final conclusion to a tale without the theatrics.",/review/rw8633476/?ref_=tt_urv

",Started off really intriguing and wanted to watch more but as I got past episode 5 I found it rather dull & boring and quite predictable.,/review/rw8633476/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,ankit-imsnoida,5," Great Concept poorly executed
",I loved the setup! It's the right amount of grim (and not too over the top horror set ups that we generally see). I also loved the concept of midnight club - stories within the story.,/review/rw8633476/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,ikata-49417,2," Not worth my time
","The writing is bland. The characters are clich√© and dull. The ""mystery"" is not compelling. The acting is adequate but not inspiring. There is nothing here that persuades me to expend any of my limited entertainment time on this show. Maybe, if I was bored and had nothing else to do, I might run this in the background while I played a game or cleaned the bathroom, but this show did not capture my attention or interest. There is an entire generation of ""writers"" in entertainment who lack originality and creativity. Almost every show has the same boring exposition, meandering dialogue and pointless plots. It's all bland porridge.",/review/rw8633476/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,clairelouise5,3," Wasted my precious Saturday night on another mediocre show
","Despite the fact that I wasn't a fan of the actual book which felt gloomy and depressing, I thought the show could be quite decent. Started off okay and the concept had potential for good horror, but it just feels like here we go again- a bunch of teens. All a little bland- one massively irritating. The effect was so dull overall. There was no atmosphere at all. No horror. Boring dialogue. I heard the main character introduce herself about 10 times. We get it, your name is Ilonka. Apparently it's Hungarian. This didn't feel fresh or original. It does feel like another show that's trying to play on the retro teen thing of Stranger Things, by bringing back an old Christopher Pike YA horror. Maybe this is aimed at teens and I'm the wrong market? It's a no from me anyhow.",/review/rw8633476/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,semmian-93345,4," More Bore
",The main problem I have with this series is that the characters are all dying but they look healthier than regular people. And the main character dresses like she's at a fashion show. She's in foster care yet has thousands of dollars worth of clothes. And how did she (and the others afford such extravagant hospice care? I must have missed something there. The star of this series is really the set of the mansion. If they went to so much trouble with that why not a little makeup on the kids.,/review/rw8633476/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2022,goldenstateguy,6," Kinda doesnt add up
","People go into hospice as a last resort, usually when nothing more can be done medically snd/or when they cannit care for themselves, meds are stopped and people die in comfort. This show has a bunch of kids in a hospice but they all look healthy, act healthy, can move around freely and can care for themselves, and they claim to be on meds but we never see any plus a real hospice stops treatments and uses pain releivers, why are they really there, it makes no sense. This is more like a dorm and kids are up at all hours, sneaking around, snooping, and seem to have no ditection. None are exhibiting sickness or weaknrss...in real life they would not be in hospice.",/review/rw8633476/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,hoboss2806,4," It gets boring after episode 4...

9 October 2022,sslssg,8," Because I am a Christopher Pike Fan
","If you aren't familiar with Christopher Pike books, this won't be a hit for you. It's unfortunate that they tried to make it a teen horror, as Pike's books aren't scary. I'm not upset with the changes to The Midnight Club book, as there is no way they could have made a series from that. Again nothing scary. It was a book about dying teens who told each other stories at midnight. There was no over arching mystery involved. So the parts about the symbol and the patient who was cured are all new for this series.",/review/rw8633476/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2022,sareed1971,4," Poor Mr. Flanagan
","I don't know if Mike Flanagan is choosing to go this route or Netflix has a hand in this, but the latest chapter of Flanagan's horror series is a watered-down, talky-teens, add a gajillion jump scares production. It pales in comparison to his previous work for Netflix.",/review/rw8633476/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,rocko90,8," For fans of Christopher Pike
","Finally, after decades, we get a good adaptation of the Christopher Pike novels. It stays pretty close to the books, thankfully! Yes there is some ""netflix"" changes to a few stories but it's fine. People comparing this to AYAOTD or how it ""isn't scary"" etc. These were teen fiction novels from the early 90s.",/review/rw8633476/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,kosmasp,8," Ghost hour
",No pun intended - I am actually not even sure if that is what the midnight hour is called. Might be a german thing - but I think you get the general idea I am trying to convey. I reckon the new review guidelines make it harder for some to just write one note things - and yet still you'll find people venting - while not having watched the whole thing! I admit I do not and will never get that. Especially when it comes to a show that is fully available from the start.,/review/rw8633476/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,tcecoleshaw,4," Lazy jump scare BS
","That's what the kids say during their midnight meeting. The jumpscares barely register in my opinion - I've seen just as many in a classic episode of Doctor who meets the Cybermen. I've only watched episode 1; the episode that supposedly reached the guiness book of records for number of jump scares in a TV episode. I don't know how under age you'd need to be to find this scary, but trust me it isn't. What may be perceived as a jump scare is so set up, without any real atmosphere or any real acting, that you definitely won't jump. So underwhelming as this is, I won't be tuning in for the second episode not least because if you take horror out of the equation, the story is less than compelling enough to leave me wanting more. I was also left underwhelmed by haunting on hill house which suggests actually the problem is the writer director who spent too much time watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and not enough time devoted to John Carpenter. This story clearly isn't for me because it doesn't live up to the first-episode hype it had been given. 4/10.",/review/rw8633476/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,whitemerrick,4," Starts decent, gets sickly sweet fast.
","I wanted to like this, the trailer gave me serious 'Are you afraid of the dark?' vibes and I thought Midnight Mass was fairly good so I gave it a shot. That said Mike Flanagan, while a decent showrunner, flannaganises everything which means he takes virtually any story and drips bucketfulls of honey on it. The sheer amount of corny a$$ scenes in this, my god, and the duration of them. The first five episodes are sorta well balanced between horror, mystery and drama but after that, the drama just overtakes everything. The sickly sweet monologues here are just unbearably long and the 'sensitive' scenes are basic at best. Ilonka, the main character, is also annoying as hell. People complaining about Anya but Ilonka is the worst. Supposedly she's a character struggling with coming to terms with her death and grasping at straws for health but she doesn't really come off desperate. She comes off like a Mary Sue in all her iterations both in the main story and the side stories. She's just soooo good, soooo sweet and so intolerable.",/review/rw8633476/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2022,josmth-73283,2," Mind-numbingly dull
","This show will make you nostalgic for a time you once were entertained by a television show. This show will make you forget what it feels like to anticipate where a story is going - forget how to care about how the characters might navigate it. A great show to watch if you take pleasure in hobbies such as: watching paint dry, scrubbing dried melted cheese off of a fork, waiting for your Uber, etc.",/review/rw8633476/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,jon_anderson77,5," Not Very Good
",The bar has been set high my Flannigan and I've loved all of his work to date but this one is not engaging. If you make it to episode 5 you feel obligated to finish it and it's quite the chore. As other reviews have mentioned these could have been done in 30 mins per episode and maybe it would have been more tolerable. The stories within the main story are very kid friendly and I initially liked that the actors played these parts but by the 3rd or 4th you are overexposed and bored of seeing them. A dream role for the cast but not so much for the audience. This would be a great entry level horror show for young teens had it not been for the swearing as it reminds me of goosebumps. A miss for Flannigan but hopefully we'll have some proper adult scares from him in the near future.,/review/rw8633476/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,susanneburns66,6," Annoying angry chick
