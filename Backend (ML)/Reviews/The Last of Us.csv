","Yes, I was once a 9-year-old who would 'yee-haw' in front of the TV every Friday night. But then I grew up and basically forgot about the Dukes of Hazzard. Years later, when I learned of the movie, I scoffed. I had zero expectations and no plans to see it. Then months later, I ran into it on HBO. ",/review/rw1870703/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hollywood now has officially gone too far and I really hope that this travesty of a motion picture creates a genuine backlash against their crap machines, in spite of the good box office returns. If you are an industry person reading our comments looking for hints on what to do next, STOP. Stop making our TV shows into these repellent, stupid, money grubbing waste of time movies that suck. By doing so you are proving one thing: Hollywood is out of ideas, and going to see the movies they churn out only perpetuates the cycle of disgust. What's next -- You guys gonna go & ruin The Bionic Man??",/review/rw1870703/?ref_=tt_urv

28 August 2005,imdb-6472,7," Fun Movie, Much Better Than Expected
","Having read some of the other comments here I was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised. REALITY CHECK: The original series wasn't that good. I think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and Daisy Duke's legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted. The Duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks, the shrunken Boss Hog was too cretinous to be evil and Rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment. It's amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first series.",/review/rw1870703/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hollywood has lost it collective mind .With zero talent in the executive ranks at almost all the major studios they keep green lighting trash like the 'Dukes of Hazzard' At one point in time the 'Dukes'was a brainless but fun Friday night diversion on TeeVee . Now it has been hopelessly trashed by Jay Chandreskhar and crew . Simpson wears short ,shorts and that is it for her acting ability . The less said about Knoxville the better and William Scott is,well, Stifler .Always will be . Uncle Jesse(Willie Nelson) is no fun at all and Boss Hogg(Burt Reynolds) has to finally admit that his career is over in Hollywood . The plot ,such as it is, concerns Hogg selling out the kingdom for a bucket full of silver to the local mining conglomerate. Not too worry Daisy Duke is there to outsmart them. Yea, right. Jessica Simpson, in real life, couldn't outsmart her dinner . Remember the Am I eating chicken or fish comment while she was eating tuna "" Says here on the can ,chicken of the sea .So I was wondering if I was eating chicken or fish "" The girl with the 160 IQ according to her mother .Right!! This film may actually give being dumb a good name.Heaven forfend . Simpsons acting career is over before it begins . Not too many roles for blond bimbos who look nice in shorts .

5 August 2005,m_jordan_jones,1," The worst film that ever reached theaters.
",This film is absolutely terrible. I'm sure it has a high budget and everything but it still doesn't cut it. The acting is really bad especially from Jessica Simpson. The stunts are well done but still is boring and predictable. It seemed like the creators thought that they were creating an action packed masterpiece or something. What were they thinking. This is really the worst film ever to reach theaters. Heck I've seen b movies that had better acting and special effects than this hunk of junk. The old dukes of hazard was OK. I never really watched it much at all. But this wannabe original film is really hard to watch. Jessica Simpson just is the worst actor and she acts like shes the hottest thing in the world or something. So unless your absolutely obsessed with the old dukes of hazard then I can recommend this film. But to everybody else avoid this movie like the plague.,/review/rw1870703/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2005,HorrorLuv_R,1," Hollywood should be ashamed of themselves.
","When I heard that the Dukes of Hazzard was going to be remade with current actors and a solid script, I was like, ""alright, I'll give it a chance, it's not going to be better than the first, but we'll see what happens."" Well, I saw what happened. I saw a great late 70's/80's show that was a classic, basically humiliated by Hollywood. It's so sad to see that Hollywood scriptwriters cannot come up with something original these days. They are seeming to take a great show that had a great target audience, and try to ""REMAKE"" the classic show. HEADS UP Hollywood... IT AIN'T WORKIN!!!! Anyway, more about the show. I think they could have casted a better actor than Sean William Scott (Stiffler from American Pie) to play Bo. I'm sure that John Schneider is definitely disappointed with how his character was portrayed and taken advantage of. Also, Get for real, Johnny Knoxville, as Luke Duke. How low can you go?? A crappy jackass actor to play lovable Luke. This sickens me. Also, I'll give Jessica Simpson is a beautiful woman, but her acting sucks. Catherine Bach who played the original Daisy, was smart, sexy, strong, opinionated and a good IL' southern girl. She was every little girls role model growing up! (I owned the doll and the Jeep - thank you very much!!!) Anyway, Jessica Simpson played a smart ass, 2-bit slut as Daisy Duke. Daisy never was blonde. Why did they have to cast her. Jessica Alba would have played a great Daisy Duke. She can speak with a great southern accent, and she is gorgeous, and would have done a wonderful job. Anyway, I'd like to say that this movie blew something fierce. I feel like I got ripped off by paying $8.50 for tickets, and they should refund my money. If you like the Dukes of Hazzard (the original series) don't see this movie. It'll just upset you. CMT (country music television) plays the reruns of the Dukes all the time later at night. So set your TIVO's and go with the real thing, not the imitation on the big screen in Hollywood.",/review/rw1870703/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2007,zardoz-13,5," ""The Dukes"" Is Actually A Prequel!
","The people behind the new ""Dukes of Hazzard"" (**1/2 out of ****) movie had the good sense to leave well enough alone in their big screen, $53 million adaptation of the popular CBS-TV series about crime, comedy and corruption in the rural South. As faithful as ""Super Troopers"" director Jay Chandrasekhar and writer John (""Cradle 2 the Grave"") O'Brien are to their amiable, low-brow, cornpone source material, this rip-snorting Warner Brothers release emerges as an overripe substitute for the original show that Kentucky native Gy Waldron created back in 1979. Of course, everybody from the original TV show is either dead or too old to reprise their roles. Moreover, none of the survivors opted to appear in walk-ons. Aside from the physical casting differences, the new ""Dukes of Hazzard"" recaptures the TV show's jovial, anti-authoritarian attitude; replicates its prefabricated plotting, and stages several high octane auto chases that top anything on the TV show. Occasionally, the movie breaks out of the mold of its predecessor and comments on the series itself from the standpoint of the politically incorrect symbol that the Confederate battle flag has become since the show went off the air. This time around our heroes have a scruffy, lived-in look with their baggy jeans and unshaven kissers. The movie ""Dukes"" pokes fun at Bo because he treats the General Lee as if it were alive, while Luke appears two jumps ahead of angry, shotgun-toting fathers and sons out to safeguard their women's virtue. Although the movie ""Dukes"" generates a lot of headlong momentum during its first hour or so, spinning an eyebrow-knitting mystery while putting the Dukes behind the proverbial 8-ball, the last half-hour unravels, owing to slipshod scripting that lets our heroes off the hook far too easily. Except for its double-digit use of profanity, the PG-13 rated movie ""Dukes"" doesn't sabotage its source material the same way that the first ""Mission Impossible"" movie did.",/review/rw1870703/?ref_=tt_urv

","what is wrong with you people, if you weren't blown away by the action car sequences and jessica Simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head. Of course the film isn't a masterpiece, i don't think it was aiming to be. It was fun and funny, i never watched the show when i was younger, i only recently saw one episode, and when i watched the movie, i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere. The movie seats were practically shaking, and the car sequences were good because it didn't bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in 2fast 2furious. and jessica Simpson is plain hot, i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences. All in all, i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on DVD. People, enjoy it for what it is.",/review/rw1870703/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2017,davispittman,5," A mixed bag
","The Dukes of Hazzard (2005) is a big screen adaptation of the Redneck loving 100% country 70s show. It stars Jonny Knoxville, Seann William Scott, Jessica Simpson, Burt Reynolds, and famed country singer Willie Nelson. The plot is pretty typical of movie adaptations of classic television shows. The villain is plotting a cartoon like scheme against the protagonists. Then the good guys of course thwart the villain in a big prolonged action sequence. So yes, it is predictable. If you dislike predictable films, then you might as well stop reading. To me, the first half of the movie was a waste, it could and should have been a whole lot better. The second half is better, but still not up to the standards I personally hold films to. The positives of the film are Willie Nelson, Burt Reynolds, and the final action sequence, I thought those aspects of the film were well done. The negatives unfortunately outweigh the positives. Jessica Simpson's character, Daisy Duke, was such a waste, she could've been a clever character, but instead literally the only purpose she served was to be a sex object the male characters could ogle at and make comments about. And also another negative was the fact that there wasn't a single joke that worked here, I didn't laugh or even chuckle once, every single gag/joke feel completely flat. Overall I give it a 5/10. Like I said, mixed bag, but I personally do not recommend it.",/review/rw1870703/?ref_=tt_urv

8 May 2008,aesgaard41,6," Less Than The Series
","I really had high hopes for this movie. The previews were good, the cast seemed interesting and the plot seemed good enough for the series, but somewhere along the line it becomes less than faithful and more of a joke to itself. Sean William Scott (Dude Where's My Car) plays Bo as a psycho car nut and Johnny Knoxville (MIB 2) plays Luke as a bad country boy stereotype. Together, they're a very funny comedy duo, but they play a lousy Bo and Luke, the good old boys we liked. Jessica Simpson makes a great Daisy Duke; she's far more sexier than Bach in that more than obvious way, and Willie Nelson's Uncle Jesse is a more enjoyable joke-telling figure but not quite the Denver Pyle family patriarch we are used to. M C Gainey plays Rosco as a demented madman instead of the likable simpleton played by James Best. With Best, you felt Rosco was a good guy controlled by Boss Hogg, but Gainey plays him as a psychopath. Burt Reynolds' Hogg is much more despicable and much more dishonest, an insult to the character virtually created by the late Sorrell Booke. From there, it expands on the series with more characters and makes a bigger star out of the General Lee with jumps, races and stunts much larger than anything done in the series. I just can't figure out how they did all that driving without filling once at Cooter's, whose played much more interesting but with less character than his TV counterpart. Overall, I see the pomp and circumstance of a big budget movie, but none of the spirit or substance of the series.",/review/rw1870703/?ref_=tt_urv
