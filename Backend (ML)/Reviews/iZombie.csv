16 August 2022,Mynameisroman,8," Unique Mix worth watching
","You may think ""another zombie show, how boring!"". There are way too many zombie shows out there nowadays. Thats true. But you might give that one a try. It doesn't try to be ""special"" by giving the zombie a different name like ""walkers"" or something. That would suggest that people didn't know what a zombie is but i digress...
usually the zombies are just the enemies but this time the zombie is actually the hero which solves crimes! But of course not all zombies are friendly! In short a cop/crime show with zombies.",/review/rw3210856/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," You'll have a good time watching this!
","IZombie was such a fun show. I'm a fan of supernatural type shows I recently gave this a try and had a blast watching it. This is not just another zombie show. It's about a medical resident (Rose McIver) who turns into a zombie. She still passes herself off as human and gets a job at the coroner's office to get access to fresh brains. Once she eats them she sees the memories of the deceased. She then pretends to be physic and helps a detective solve the their murders. It has a great villain in David Anders and the rest of the supporting cast (Aly Michalka, Rahul Kohli, Robert Buckley, Malcom Goodwin) all do an excellent job. If you're looking for a fun show to kill some time with then give this a try.",/review/rw3210856/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Better Than Expected!
",IZombe is so much better than it has any business being. I never watched it when it was in the air because I always thought it was a show aimed at tweens but after hearing and reading enough good things about it I thought I'd finally give it a chance. I'm glad I did because I had a lot of fun watching this series. It's such an original show that combines the zombie genre with the crime genre and succeeds in doing so. It has a much lighter tone than other zombie shows like The Walking Dead so if you're explaining show like that then you'll be disappointed. This show will make you laugh more than scare you. It knows what kind of show it is and has no problem making fun of itself.,/review/rw3210856/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2015,tedphx,8," What a pleasant surprise
","I had no expectations for iZombie, but I've already watched the pilot three times. The story was good, the cast was great, and Rose McIver was stellar! My wife likened her to Buffy. I replied that she was kind of a zombie version of The Listener (another great show, btw), and a funny one at that! Malcolm Goodwin and Rahul Kohli were also instantly likable. Their characters each held up his end extremely well against the riveting presence of McIver/Moore And what a great idea to have Liv gain her insights by eating the brains of the deceased - her instant command of Romanian was hilarious. I look forward to seeing what other quirks the writers come up with for her.",/review/rw3210856/?ref_=tt_urv

15 July 2022,sauerkraut-96467,8," Series starts out great then fizzles
","The first 3 1/2 seasons were fabulous. Great premise and stories, and very creative. The last season and a half, were not nearly as good, once they walled of Seatle. I like the comedy in this series a lot. Sometimes it was in your face, sometimes subtle. For instance, the main characters name Olivia Moore, or as what she goes by Liv Moore! Or the evil corporation, Fillmore Graves! LOL.",/review/rw3210856/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2022,ITALUKE,8," 8/10.
","I'm not a fan of this type of zombies, but I still enjoyed this series. I believe the story to be good. I found the last season to be disappointing to be honest.",/review/rw3210856/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2022,jimbokwright,8," Fun entertainment
",The show is always fun but it has its ups and downs. Sometimes it's a 7 and sometimes a 10 but always fun. The lead actress in particular is always amazing. Her comedic and acting talent make the show work. She basically plays a different character every single episode. Her talents might be wasted in anything else.,/review/rw3210856/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2022,teepleg-992-684613,9," Not just for young people
","I recently saw a ""critics consensus"" of this show which said that it might be too youth-oriented to resonate with adult audiences. Well, I saw this in my sixties and I loved it. I've always been appreciative of sci-fi and supernatural books and shows, but not just any -- they have to be well-written and well-acted and this one certainly is.",/review/rw3210856/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2015,philhodgman,9," Yes to Izombie
","Here's an alert to some of the reviewers, who seem to view this as a traditional TV drama - It's Not. A living dead zombie who assists the police in finding bad guys after eating the brains of victims is inherently ridiculous and, consequently, tongue in cheek (or perhaps in brain). Somehow, though, the show seems to pull off a balancing act between farcical situations and scenes with real emotion and drama. ",/review/rw3210856/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,gladysmutie,10," Great Series Throughout
","I started watching this series when it premiered. I wasn't disappointed. I stopped watching after season three when everyone turned, I mean what else was left? I didn't want any disappointments like I've experienced in other series. Anyway fast forward to 2022. I came across it on Netflix and I was like 'meh' maybe I'll watch it. I got bored and resumed where I left off. I expected disappoinment because I wondered what else was left. However, I can confidently state that I wasn't disappointed. It went on great and managed to work in the storyline. The ending is also great and unexpected: I promise you'll get closure.",/review/rw3210856/?ref_=tt_urv

20 March 2015,dwaynemayo60,8," Thought it would be a loser but really kinda great
","I really liked this first episode and the way they put it all together the why and the how she ends up working with the police and how she deals with being a zombie was done nicely. It has a kinda ""6 feet under kinda feel but a little more light hearted. Also the situation is not gonna be real life so sometimes the situation is a little unbelievable, like cops aren't always gonna act the way real cops would exactly and people aren't gonna always freak at the concept of someone being a zombie etc. The humor was good too, actually caught myself in an unexpected chuckle. You know the kind that takes like a half second to hit you. very good almost gave it 9 stars but I like to save 9 and 10 for stuff I;m totally thrilled with. Acting was good the characters are likable. This could be one that moves up to the 9 or 10 start level after a few episodes",/review/rw3210856/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2018,mightyzewski,6," Started out strong but fizzled
","I loved the first 2 seasons, season 3 was ok. Season 4 is terrible. They are really overdoing the personalities from the brains and I don't like that they are starting to fade out her zombie look. I am watching an episode where she is acting like a British knight and cringing every time she starts talking. The whole renegade story line is too much.",/review/rw3210856/?ref_=tt_urv

21 April 2022,jzimss,10," Team Chakrabarti!
","Love this series, I was so sad when I finished it! The actors and writers were perfect, and they nailed that tough combo of murder mystery and comedy. I laughed out loud several times, and we all need more of that. Great character arcs, and it's always nice to see some humor behind the antagonists. Please someone - give us another season!!!",/review/rw3210856/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2022,helwigs,9," Don't expect it to be like the comic
","If you thoroughly enjoyed the comic you may be disappointed In the TV show. I personally didn't like the comic compared to the show. Instead of having ghosts, zombies and werewolves the show only has the zombies and I think it allowed the writers to experiment more with the characters and add depth compared to everyone being something supernatural. Liv's job is also different but I think coroner who helps cops because they happen to come in contact more than an undertaker was a good choice.",/review/rw3210856/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2022,sweber3303-590-815866,8," Well cast. Poorly directed
","Casting for this show was excellent, with the exception of one character. David Anders is well cast, as a villain/antagonist, but is clearly overacting throughout the series. He is an American, who has played an American villain in many shows, but continues to use some strange needless American ""accent"" (Blaine DeBeers). If I didn't know better, I'd think he foreign (non American) speaking, and had to change his dialect for the show. It's very cringy. He's trying too hard, and it ruins the character every time he opens his mouth. It was obvious in the pilot. The director just needed to tell him to stop trying too hard.",/review/rw3210856/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2019,dandholmes82,9," Sad to see it go, but good solid ending.
","I've very much enjoyed this show over the years and it is truly sad to see it end. I am however glad with the outcome considering how many other shows completely blow it( looking at you GOT). Or then there's the opposite of when a show goes way past it's expiration date (supernatural, walking dead, etc). So on that note, thank you for five wonderful seasons izombie cast and crew, you will be missed!",/review/rw3210856/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2022,mrpthompson,8," Great start but not so good finish
","This show started out great. The concept, writing, and cast were all very good. Then toward the end of season 3, it became campy. It seems every single character started to overact. I know and appreciate the show is mostly a comedy but they just got carried away.",/review/rw3210856/?ref_=tt_urv

","Let me preface this review by stating that I am not a fan of zombie-themed entertainment.
