","You could say this is a Western version of a children song, ""10 little ..."" (and whatever probably racist or at least discriminatory thing came after that in your country - it's Indians in America, which kind of seems fitting replacing them with Cowboys, mostly). And let me make clear that I did watch the 70mm longer version of the movie, that also had an Interlude. Kind of as they did in the old days ... though the movie due to it's depictions of violence would not have had a chance in the old days (playing in cinemas that is).",/review/rw3422778/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2020,noahmed,9," Quinton Tarantino's Most Underrated Film
","I never saw this film back when it was released in 2015. But, I did manage to buy a copy of Blu-Ray. Now, when I first saw it, I thought this movie was flawless/perfect. I now know that no movie despite what anyone may say, is perfect. But I am firm believer that this is in fact Quinton Tarantino's most underrated and under-appreciated film. Everyone I've talked to, says the Hateful Eight isn't Tarantino's most re-watchable film. I disagree. With a phenomenal cast that really gets into their characters. Each one stands out and not one is forgetful. Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell are the stars of this film and it shows. Their performances (in my opinion) were Oscar worthy. Don't even get me started on the story. This is basically a Who-Done-It play turned into a film. The complexity of this story should make the audience feel confused and turn their heads going, ""what the hell is happening?"". But it does the exact opposite. Everything flows perfectly. The pacing of this film, while it is almost 3 hours, it doesn't feel like it. The cinematography is great. The score brings tension and makes the audience uneasy. But I think my favorite thing of this film, is the scenery. Having these 8 characters who all hate each other, trapped by a blizzard. Really builds up the tension of the catastrophe that is coming. The only thing that is working against this film is the lengthy setup shots at the beginning of the movie. The first five minutes of the film is plagued by it and those tend to drag on. Beyond that, everything about this film is great.",/review/rw3422778/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Great
","Everything you would come to expect from Tarantino, just on a more confined scale. The original screen play and acting both amaze, it is always refreshing to see some of the banter and slang he comes up with. Yes it is super violent but once again the director makes it so we really don't care, the music fits perfect as well.",/review/rw3422778/?ref_=tt_urv

31 January 2016,Fella_shibby,10," A dash of Peckinpah, Leone n Takeshi. The harsh weather n the set up is heavily inspired by The Great Silence n Wheels aka Tockovic.
","Tarantino's direction, the performance of the entire cast combined with the deeply engaging dialogues make for an awesome experience.
Robert Bridge Richardson's cinematography n Ennio Morricone's score adds more flavor.
The film is focused around the dialogues, with the relationships between the characters constantly changing as they are confined in such tight spaces a la Reservoir Dogs.
While watching outdoor scenes I felt cold a la The Great Silence.
The weather in this film is so well depicted that when the stagecoach finally reaches Minnie's Haberdashery, I felt relieved for the freezing characters.
Good to see Kurt Russell with the coolest handle bar mustache. He was good in Bone Tomahawk too.
The story line was intriguing. Found a lil similar to Tockovic aka Wheels n Reservoir Dogs.",/review/rw3422778/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2016,Jerghal,7," Don't believe the hype, it's okay but Tarantino can do better
","So I've finally seen this much talked about film and I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The H8 is a 168 min long movie which is described as a sort of mystery thriller and a lot a noise was made (mainly by Quentin himself) when the script leaked early and therefore would harm the box office chances of this flick. The movie did indeed not make big waves money wise but that was mainly because the overly long movie does actually not amount to much story wise. In other words there is no real clue. The dialogue, normally the strongpoint of Tarantino films, is actually not that great. Conversations are drawn out without the characters actually saying anything. It does help a lot that we do get a great cast (Kurt Russel, Sam L Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh) because without them the movie would fall apart rather quickly. The film was shot on 2,76:1 70mm widescreen because retro elitist Tarantino thinks digital isn't good enough and I do have to say the snowy landscape shots look awesome but they make up only 2% of the flick. The rest of it is in a cabin where standard 35mm or even a digital camera could have perfectly captured the images. About the music I can be short: there is almost none. It' might have been composed by Moricone who unrightfully got an Oscar for it, but it does not add much here in this film. I'm glad I didn't see it on the big screen. It works just as well on the small screen, maybe even better coz you can pauze it to get more booze and a snack. So despite my rather harsh comments I would recommend it but know that this is far from Tarantino's best work.",/review/rw3422778/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2015,vaivhav,10," Go for it. Ignore the haters. Tarantino entertainment to the core!
","This is a short review I am forced to write after noticing the critics and the haters. Hateful Eight is another Tarantino masterpiece. It may be similar to his previous movies, but great directors don't come often and in a single life they can make only so many films. Now if Tarantino decides to make another 'Tanrantino' western with all the fine work thrown in as in his other films, I am no one no complain. This guy is a legend and I am privileged to see the handful of movies he will make in his lifetime. Even if he makes similar movies a dozen times, I would still watch it, cause this guy knows filmmaking at its finest. Hateful Eight is a blizzard of fine acting, fine dialogue, humor, darkness, snow and that incredible eye for perfection and storytelling. ",/review/rw3422778/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2016,classicsoncall,9," ""Well, I guess I should be plumb scared right now, huh?""
","There was an interesting observation made by the character Mobray (Tim Roth) in the story when he began to speak about justice. He stated that justice delivered without dispassion is always in danger of not being justice. Which was somewhat ironic considering Tarantino's ragging on policemen about the time this movie came out; not too much dispassion in his ranting when it comes to singling out a profession made impossibly difficult by politicizing their every move. With that, one would expect that my attitude about the film would be negative, but I actually get a kick out of Tarantino's pictures and this was no exception. I liked the set up, the story, the cinematography and the principal players, well cast for their roles and for the dynamic each one of them brings to the picture. I also go for the quirky unexpected stuff, like the nailing of Minnie's door shut to keep out the blizzard, the revelation that Minnie herself was a black woman (didn't see that coming at all), and the hell's bell's reaction of Walton Goggins' character in the story's resolution. I must be getting used to Tarantino's pictures by now because except for a handful of times, I didn't really even hear the 'n' word that so many reviewers here say surpassed it's use in ""Django Unchained"". But for all of that, I think Quentin needs to develop some new ideas because they're becoming decidedly repetitious in his pictures. There's the racist thing, the buckets of blood, the severed body parts, the repeated casting of various players (Jackson, Madsen, etc.) and the sexual depravity meant to intentionally shock. You know, maybe offer up a look at a topic while remaining dispassionate.",/review/rw3422778/?ref_=tt_urv

","During the winter in the Wyoming, a six-horse stagecoach stumbles upon a black man with three corpses that asks for a ride to escape from the blizzard that is coming. The bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell), who is transporting the criminal Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to be hanged in Red Rock town, recognizes the also bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) and takes safety precautions before let him go with them. Then they come across Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), who claims to be the Red Rock's new sheriff, and John also allows him to travel with them. They stop at the general stop of Minnie to seek refugee from the blizzard and a Mexican man called Bob (Demián Bichir) tells that he is taking care of the place while Minnie (Dana Gourrier) and her husband are visiting her mother. They meet the Red Rock's hangman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth); the confederate general Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern) and the cowboy Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) sheltered in the place. The distrustful John Ruth and Marquis take their weapons and there is a tense environment in the store. When the coffee is poisoned killing two guests, the truth of what is happening in the place is disclosed with tragic consequences. ",/review/rw3422778/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2015,jfgibson73,3," Can't Put My Finger On What's Wrong
","This is the first Tarantino movie that has failed to entertain me in any way. I enjoyed the snowy Wyoming scenery, but that was it. I didn't care about the characters or what happened to them. If some of his other films were uneven, there were at least scenes that I enjoyed watching back, and I always appreciated his unique dialog. I could complain about the fact that it took place almost entirely in one room, but Reservoir Dogs used a similar narrative device and it is infinitely watchable. I can think of similar films, like The Master or Glengarry Glenross, in which the point is more about the dialog and performances than how the story resolves, and I almost always enjoy these movies. I can't really say why I didn't feel anything watching Hateful Eight--given the talent involved, I should be enjoying it as much as other viewers seem to. For whatever reason, it just left me completely disinterested.",/review/rw3422778/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2016,gridoon2023,3," Gratuitous violence and gratuitous overlength
","What's the matter with Tarantino? There's no denying the man's talent, but in his latest film he seems to have lost control, or maybe he just doesn't know when to quit. This film has been referred to as a ""return"", of sorts, to his debut feature ""Reservoir Dogs"", but whereas ""Dogs"" was tightly and economically constructed, with nary a wasted moment, ""The Hateful Eight"" is overblown and ridiculously overlong; it should have been half as long. And Tarantino seems to revel so much in violence, ugliness, nihilism and misanthropy (not to mention misogyny) that the film leaves you with a ""bleccch"" feeling. Even the mystery turns out not to matter much, since everyone is guilty anyway! Or maybe we are supposed to take this as a very black, over-the-top comedy. But the dialogue is rarely as witty or as memorable as expected, and when the few laughs do come, the audience's senses are pretty much numbed already. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is super, but the film is little more than an exercise in killing off characters for shock value only. * out of 4.",/review/rw3422778/?ref_=tt_urv

","Even tho i was expecting more action, I've found myself at the edge of my seat at times. The characters were nicely developed. The dialogue was as expected from a Tarantino movie. The story is 3 hours long, it takes place mostly in a one single room and it's still not boring. That's something not everyone can do. All of the actors we're perfect for their roles and the acting was great as well as the character design, all of the characters were memorable and well written. The movie is divided into chapters in most of which a small twist takes place that makes you more interested in the movie. I enjoyed the film but my biggest flaws were the length and the spontaneous introduction of a narrator mid- movie, that was a pretty 'out of nowhere' lazy way to develop the back story, but oh well, Tarantino is known for making risks and doing crazy sh*t",/review/rw3422778/?ref_=tt_urv
