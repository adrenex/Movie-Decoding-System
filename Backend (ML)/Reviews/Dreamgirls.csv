29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Bring this back!
","As a huge fan of Marvel I'm a little biased because I pretty much like everything they put out. My bias aside, Luke Cage is terrific! If you don't believe me just read through the reviews here and look at the ratings. Even the critics loved this show. It's about a fugitive who gets super strength after an experiment goes wrong. He moves back home to Harlem to try to rebuild his life and make his home a safe place from all the terrible people try to take over. Now that it's on Disney plus maybe they can bring him back. They've already started to bring back others and recently renewed Daredevil so there's still hope. At least bring him back into the MCU somehow. If you're a Marvel fan then this is a must watch!",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2020,Supermanfan-13,9," Not quite as good as Daredevil or The Punisher but still pretty good!
","While Luke Cage is not quite as good as The Punisher or Daredevil, it's still a very good, action packed show that is absolutely worth watching! It's another Netflix Marvel show that is outstanding. It's just too bad that they had to part ways because I loved all 5 of their shows, some more than others but all still good. Mike Colter was terrific as Luke Cage!",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2022,tyceadams,7," Luke cage
","Luke cage was pretty decent, I would say it's action, a lot of really cool scenes, some episodes and scenes were a bit boring, some episodes can be a bit slow too, but most episodes were good, it wasn't the best show ever but it's still a good one, I still enjoyed the show.",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2022,frankiesilver-91836,8," SEASON 2 REVIEW: An amazing and stylistic season of a fantastic show.
","I finished this show recently and it's one of the best super hero shows I've ever seen. Season 2 picks right back up the music-filled, crime-oriented storytelling of Season 1 and does it just as well. It continues to perfectly incapsulate MCU's Harlem, analyzing the area's crime and culture in an unbiased way. A real African American superhero story that is realistic and doesn't sugarcoat anything.",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2022,oscarjneklund,7," Good! üëäüèø
","This show is actually pretty good. Nice action scenes, I think they choosed the perfect actor for this role, look madly strong, is nice and are just a great actor. üá∫üá≤",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2018,SnoopyStyle,7," great character and actor
",Luke Cage (Mike Colter) received superpowers when he was experimented on in a private prison. He has super strength and impenetrable skin. He returns to his Harlem neighborhood to fight local crime lord Cottonmouth (Mahershala Ali) and other villains. Misty Knight (Simone Missick) is a police detective fighting for justice.,/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2022,johtukun,8," So much potential that was barely realised
","Luke Cage, although not in the top three of marvel-Netflix shows is still really good. I think that it has the best presentation and aesthetic but lacks somewhat in execution. The latter half of season one takes a dive in quality and the final seconds of the show ruins the character of Luke Cage in my opinion. But I still think it had the potential to be so much better. If Disney gave this show another shot with the same people but maybe gave some course correction along the way with the other people from the marvel-Netflix shows it could be a really good stylish show.",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2022,hodgesdanny,7," Great performances are the highlight of this solid series
","The show isn't without its flaws. There are elements of the script that feel slightly generic, cliched, unfocused, or heavy-handed, but the sheer strength of the performances, particularly Mahershala Ali's Cottonmouth and Alfre Woodard's Mariah, as well as Luke Cage himself and Rosario Dawson's Claire, keep the show engaging even when it occasionally stumbles. There's some solid action, too, and a quality rendition of Luke Cage's origin story.",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2022,calistep,8," Solid overall
","Although some of the storylines can sometimes be drawn out a little too long, this is still a solid series overall with a very solid cast, most importantly Mike Colter who beautifully bring Luke Cage to life.",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2018,snowyprecipice,9," Season 2 redeemed the show
","First season was messy, a little boring and a little unwatchable. Season two was solid and the characters were amazing. The development of Mariah, Hernan and Tilda were amazing! Extra props to Hernan; he was absolutely amazing to watch. Luke's small conflict suited him; he didn't need a big losing-himself-and-finding-himself arc - that was well done. Even the Jamaican dude was well done. Loved Danny's cameo!",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv

14 December 2020,classicsoncall,7," ""We can't have guys like me running around on every corner"". - Luke Cage to Claire Temple, episode #1.9
","The character of Luke Cage burst upon the comic book scene in June, 1972 with the publication of Marvel's 'Luke Cage, Hero for Hire #1'. It was renamed 'Luke Cage, Power Man' with the 17th issue, and had a forty nine issue run as a sole adventure, super-hero title until the character's teaming with Iron Fist in 'Power Man and Iron Fist #50'. From there, Luke Cage was incorporated into other Marvel titles and team-ups, after becoming the first black superhero to be featured as the protagonist and title character of a comic book. Luke Cage had a significant impact on a comic book fan who eventually became an actor, who wanted to make it on his own instead of relying on his family name. That's how Nicholas Coppola became Nicolas Cage.",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2018,southdavid,7," Sweet Sweetbacks Badass Christmas
","Now the show is seemingly cancelled, though the future of the characters is still to be decided, I thought I'd submit my opinion on the two seasons of ""Luke Cage"" that Netflix has provided.",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2016,n-m-bertin,5," Not that good, falls short on writing and acting
","The first few episodes feel good. Nice music, nice directing, Luke Cage is played by a good actor and a couple of supporting actors are good as well. But from episode to episode it falls into the ridiculous. Cottonmouth has powers in the comics, he's got nothing here... Just another stupid gangster, with an origin story than comes way too late. And then poof, he's dead. Right after the writers put some depth into him. What's the point...",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2022,mitchell_gros,8," Luke Cage deserves at least two more seasons.
","Luke Cage is a Neo Blaxploitation Masterpiece, a good balance of story, history and style. Never a dull moment, not gonna lie in season 2 Black Mariah gets a little cartoonish at times but still good. This show deserves another season or two.",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2020,kosmasp,9," Not Luke warm
","Well for some it was I reckon, but it is tough to please everyone anyway, so this being different is either good or bad. Connected with the other shows on Netflix, this also works as stand alone, even if people from the other shows pop up (look for a timeline to watch the shows if you care, because there are some consequences that are being carried over too).",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2022,williamxbones,," Cool characters
","The first season was great for the origins part, it show how cool Luke is and how great Mike Colter is in the role. Harlem is used just as well as Hell's Kitchen in Daredevil, the club is great and so is the music. The villain is really not good, the villain being a copycat of the hero always lead to bad story telling. The romance with Claire was pretty good it gave something interesting to the show other than Luke and Misty.",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv

23 October 2018,sbagatelli1,9," All the elements of the defenders are great
","Not sure why so many people are down on Luke Cage and Iron Fist, but if I were to rate the different series, I would rate Jessica Jones as my least favorite, although I found season 2 to be so much better than season 1. Keep them all going strong.",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2016,yoyopa,2," What happened to Luke Cage
","Just like the title...What happened to Luke Cage?! This was not the character we met in Jessica Jones. This dynamic,brooding, multi layered hero we were all dying to know more about. By far Luke was more interesting in Jones than in his own series and we can blame that on the showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker.",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv

4 July 2018,intrepidami,8," Season 2 Sweet Christmas or Sweet Molasses? Stay with it, there's a payoff.
","Gosh sometimes episodes are a slow burn. Lots of heavy dialogue in-between any action. Especially in the first 8 episodes or so. We get endless conversations. And because everybody is trying to win a writing Emmy which is fine, it's almost the superhero equivalent of My Dinner with Andre.",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv

30 November 2018,hazzahamnwardy,8," Season 2
","This season is amazing, definitely surpasses the first season for me, and the best season of any of the Netflix marvel shows. This season, you need to watch The Defenders to understand what is going on, but that's fine because The Defenders is great. This season shows Luke Cage slowly turning into a antagonist, I was confused who the villain was this season, because Luke was being very violent, abusive to Claire, so thats why she left, which I thought was a good decision, because it shows Luke without the person he loves the most, which was great because then he was left with his dad instead. A character that I have to talk about is Bushmaster, he is by far the best villain of the Netflix marvel shows, maybe even the MCU. He made me feel sympathetic for him, which is what makes a good villain. Now, let's talk about the other villain, Mariah. She is a horrible person, she is turned into the thing that Cottonmouth said she would turn into, ""Black Mariah"", when she is on screen, you could be excited, scared, interested with what she has to say. She is a great villain and character in this series. Now let's talk about Shades, in the first season I could care less about Shades, I thought that he was a character that is there to expand Mariah's ark, but in this season he is a awesome character, he is by far in the top 5 characters of the Marvel Netflix shows, this season gave him redemption, to help Harlem, and stop Mariah, which is what he does. Some side characters were fine, like Shade's friend that he has to kill, which expands Shades ark. Tilda (Mariah's daughter) was good, had some good scenes, but is there to show Mariah that her family doesn't want her anymore, which also involves Shades as well. Overall, a fantastic season, the best season of any Netflix Marvel show, so I will give it a 9.5/10, hard to top, fantastic",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2016,aero-windwalker,3," Generally speaking not very satisfying
","So first of, I realized I am just not very into the whole marvel superhero theme anymore after 30 years of reading and watching. They just seem to have too many plot holes and go against my knowledge in natural science. Perhaps its about time to stop watching them.",/review/rw3554899/?ref_=tt_urv
