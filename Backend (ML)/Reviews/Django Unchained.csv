2 September 2018,mkquinn91,7," Much Better Than I Expected!
","It has some fantastic one-liners and generally great dialogue and chemistry between the leads. I was especially happy seeing Zoey Deutch in a movie that deserves her. I've always found her charming, but her prior leads roles were in Vampire Academy and Dirty Grandpa, which didn't inspire confidence in her career. ",/review/rw4214428/?ref_=tt_urv

",Two ridiculously overworked personal assistants hit on the idea of setting up their respective bosses together in the hopes that the assistants will then get pushed around a bit less. At first they're surprisingly successful but a plot this ambitious could never run totally smoothly could it? ,/review/rw4214428/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2018,atiyaahsan,8," Surprisingly funny and charming!!
","I had seen the movie's trailer beforehand but didn't have high expectations from this one. I am happy to report I was wrong. The movie is funny, witty and thoroughly engrossing. I wasn't bored for a minute, thanks to the snappy dialogue and crisp editing and direction. 
I must admit I only decided to watch it cuz' of the big names like Luc Liu & Tae Diggs, and though both of them played their characters of A**hole bosses convincingly, but it's the primary couple of Zoey Deutch & Glen Powell that makes you fall in love with them. Even the supporting actors cast in bit roles like the coffee shop waiter, the elevator guy and the gay best friend played their roles perfectly. I found my self constantly laughing out loud.
All in all, it was a very enjoyable film that all rom-com lovers will enjoy.",/review/rw4214428/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2020,akcenat,6," Conventional light-hearted rom-com with predictable story that never really progresse, but delivers exactly what it promises
","Netflix's ""Set It Up"" - the debut feature of TV directing veteran Claire Scanlon (while heavily pregnant) - never quite innovates enough to push beyond the conventions of rom-com genre. Character development is weak and the story makes this film the kind of production which makes Netflix seem like the internet bargain bin for entertainment, but what's the harm in an easy-to-swallow movie that makes you feel good? This is escapism at its finest and thanks to the cast film is definitely worthy of your time. In the end, ""Set It Up"" may have an extremely familiar story, but it's also sweet and adorable (at times) showing that love or even sex can be powerful and really change people.",/review/rw4214428/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2018,tributarystu,7," Vicarious lovin'
","Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell reunite after the excellent Everybody Wants Some (2016) in this low frills, high-chemistry rom-com. There isn't much to dwell on here, as 'Set It Up' proves the ideal low-stakes Friday night Netflix watch.",/review/rw4214428/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2020,PerryAtTheMovies,6," A clean rom-com with a decent story...
","Initial Thoughts:
Though a couple of years old, it was refreshing to watch a rom-com that was clean, and yet not so clean, that it was mushy and inane. All the actors brought about their own personalities that worked in unison with each others. Nothing about this film was weird or awkward, and although the ending was predictable, this was a fun story to watch.",/review/rw4214428/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2018,krystalhupfer,8," Super cute...
",".... there were definitely some places where it could've been funnier, but overall I enjoyed it. It was super distracting at the end when all the passerby's were staring, obviously meaning they couldn't afford to block side walks and hire extras. 
The Positive: I found myself smiling long after scenes had ended. Definitely a feel good movie.",/review/rw4214428/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2021,plasmapilot,9," A LAUGH-OUT-LOUD GREAT TIME
","The humor and chemistry between the two protagonists made this really special! It may have been a bit predictable, but not to the point of distraction. Clever dialog and an all-around good time. Wish I'd had some üçø popcorn.",/review/rw4214428/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2021,cgdtpmqq,9," Nah bc this is the best rom com in the past 10 years
",A completely underrated rom com with perfect casting and so much heart. It's not as cheesy or cringey as the typical (especially Netflix original) rom com. They don't make them like this anymore unfortunately.,/review/rw4214428/?ref_=tt_urv

1 September 2020,chloegalley,8," Surprisingly a great film
","So I watched set it up on Netflix on a Saturday evening and was really impressed with the movie. A good romantic, comedy that you can watch with friends. I really enjoyed it. Great acting good storyline and kept me entertained all the way through. Everything was spot on could not fault it. A must watch if you have not seen it",/review/rw4214428/?ref_=tt_urv

3 July 2018,ACSpader,2," I can't believe Liu and Diggs actually read the script before signing
","I'm an avid fan of fluffy, contentless films from this genre, so it's quite hard to find an example of it that's truly awful. But this film nails it! From the unrelatable, unlikeable character played by the usually charismatic Taye Diggs, the unrealisism of Liu's character falling for such an a**hole (from a meet cute which devolves in to 'oh no, a fat guy with no shirt on')- Glen Powell wasn't really utilised at all and came off like a bland Alan Ruck, and Zoey Deutch has a lot of potential, but this film managed to wash even her out. I watched it with a group and we just kept saying 'Oh no...' This film is basically everything that's wrong with the romcom. It would have been a million times better if they'd given Taye Diggs a character who wasn't disgusting, or Lucy Liu had point blank refused to date him- which was what we'd expected from the outset.",/review/rw4214428/?ref_=tt_urv

6 August 2018,jefrazier-95555,8," Cute & Fun
","I'm disappointed in all of the harsh criticism. This movie was fun and lovable. They set the tone for what to expect in the very beginning. ""Over-acting?"" It's a romantic comedy for crying out loud. I recommend this movie for the perfectly-delivered, witty dialogue. As an added bonus, the chemistry between Zoey and Glen was fantastic.",/review/rw4214428/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2018,Wizard-8,4," Not too funny rom-com
","I feel I should first admit that romantic comedies are usually not my cup of tea. The reason why I sat down to watch this particular one was that it had Lucy Liu in the cast, and she is in my favorite television show, ""Elementary"". Liu is pretty good in this movie, making her character a believably hard and demanding boss while at the same time not going overboard so much to make her come across as hateful and unlikable. The other thing about the movie I appreciated was that the ending of the movie doesn't quite end up wrapping everything up in a way that you may be expecting. But apart from those two things, I didn't particularly enjoy the movie. The two young leads in the movie are too jokey and broad in their performances, enough so that they come across as annoying simpletons. The story is also thin in a number of aspects, and it's made worse by a running time (105 minutes) that is too long for its own good. Also, apart from a few mild chuckles, the movie simply isn't all that funny, with its humor being very predictable and familiar. In the end, you'll probably be saying ""Turn it off!"" to ""Set It Up"" long before its end credits start to roll.",/review/rw4214428/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2018,Akshay_Patel1985,8," A ""Must Watch"" light comedy.
","As the title suggests, its a must watch light-hearted comedy that hits the perfect notes for a fun night with family or wife/girlfriend. Enjoyed the movie and ofcourse the characters were perfectly played by the actors. A huge shout out to #ZoeyDeutch who played her role marvelously ...bringing the whole movie together in a wonderful way.",/review/rw4214428/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2018,xhidden99,," It's a rom-com stop complaining
",Rom-coms don't need to be reviewed. They're rom-coms. They're all the same. They're not good or bad they're rom-coms. Stop looking for reasons to like or dislike them. If the heat death of the universe could be an art form it would be a rom-com.,/review/rw4214428/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2018,ThomasDrufke,8," And Yet....
","When I heard there was a solid Netflix original rom-com film coming out I had a few thoughts. One, Netflix makes good original films? Because from what I've seen, they tend to do a whole lot better on the television side of things. And the second thing I thought of was the severe lack of great romantic comedies there are in this age of film. So when I hear of a good one, I try and jump on it as soon as possible. Set It Up follows some rom-com cliches, but makes them their own by creating a freshly original plot inside an office building. The ""set it up"" part of the film feels like something you've seen a thousand times, but the combination of Zoey Deutch's irresistible charm and Glen Powell's breakout comedically, Set It Up is easily one of the most thoroughly enjoyable films of 2018. It takes 30 minutes before the film picks up comedically and dramatically, but once it does I found myself laughing out loud more than once. It's an easy 100 minute watch that neither demands too much from an audience but also doesn't dumb anything down. Admittedly, they succeed more in making you laugh than cry, but I will always be down to watch actors display great chemistry in any setting, but it especially impresses romantically.",/review/rw4214428/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2018,dennelasicat,9," I really loved this film because it is unlike the current trend of shallow chick flicks these days...
","After watching other films from Netflix and others that reached mainstream media (ex. Kissing Booth, Ibiza, Midnight Sun, etc)... all of which are shallow, annoying and predictable movies with little to no significant scenes. Scenes that make you think, or etch your heart. Set It Up may be a bit over the top with the crazy bosses in the movie, it still resonared with me because of its memorable lines. ""You like because, you love despite"". I absolutely loved the ending as it sort of tied up all loose strings into a perfect bow.",/review/rw4214428/?ref_=tt_urv
