9 October 2007,KatharineFanatic,10," don't listen to the naysayers
","Most of the complaints people have about this show are from embittered Buffy fans. I love both of those shows, but the truth is that ""Moonlight"" is more my style, kind of like how the 1979 version of Dracula soothes my romantic senses much more than the version from the mid nineties. If you like more ""realism"" in your vampire stories, you will love ""Moonlight."" The main protagonist is Mick St. John, a vampire who was turned by his bride on their wedding night in the mid 1900's. Due to a change of heart and to the disappointment of his mentor Josef (one of the series' best characters), he turns to crime-solving. Unlike Angel, the demons he deals with are human rather than razor-clawed blue monsters. In the background is Beth, a reporter who remembers Mick from her childhood, when he saved her from the evil clutches of an old flame (in more ways than one).",/review/rw1876545/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2008,chrisdpol-orders2,10," Sorry to see this show go.
","This show had an odd premise, but was quite a bit of fun to watch. The plots were a little thin, but the love triangle running through the show made it interesting. The triangle is Mick, Beth and the problem of Mick's being a vampire. ",/review/rw1876545/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2007,SkidMcCormick,10," Why Moonlight is good!
","First of all, if you're expecting Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Angel, then forget it. This is something like Forever Knight, but what makes this CBS series a standout, is the way it's shot and the fact there isn't a hellmouth in sight. Very beautiful cinematography and the way nighttime L.A. is captured is in keeping with the whole vampire mythos (fast forwarding to create an eerie atmosphere,etc). I've noticed a few comments being made that the stories are cheesy. Really? Were you expecting Mills & Boon? There are twinges of humour, but you need to look out for it.If you had bad actors, then yeah, that would be the case. But Alex O'Loughlin (who was so good in the last season of The Shield)makes a really convincing vamp PI with morals. He kinda reminds me a slimmer version of Gerard Butler's Dracula 2000 movie and is naturally broody without trying. It's also good to see the gorgeous Brit, Sophia Myles (aka Keira Knightley's more voluptuous, better actress friend) get a decent role where she does a very good American accent. Brian J. White, Kevin Weismen & Jason Dohring also deserve mentioning as they bring more meat to the table. Let's hope their roles develop and as Joel Silver is producing this, we can hope this will be commissioned for a second season - because it is that good & CBS is known for its quality output - (Hey, if Shark can be renewed...?)",/review/rw1876545/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2007,swusterb,8," Better Than Expected
","Okay, I've seen the promos pretty much all summer long. Our family is a Big Brother family and they touted this series continually. Honestly, I really figured I'd give it a miss. However, tonight I watched ""Ghost Whisperer"" with my wife, then she left the room and I was about to change the channel when two of my kids asked me not to change it because they wanted to watch it. Being a concerned parent, I stayed and watched.",/review/rw1876545/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2007,xindi005,7," Decent, stylish, but VERY Familiar
","I just caught the new supernatural series premiere of CBS's new show, MOONLIGHT. To be honest, I liked the first episode, but after seeing countless shows of this natural, it seems to repetitive.",/review/rw1876545/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2008,johnnymacbest,8," More gritty and realistic than ""Angel"".
","I like this series...a lot. It's more grounded realistically per se than ""Angel"". This show has no werewolves, zombies, or other bizarre creatures; it just presents vampires more contemporary and in my opinion that makes the show work so well on so many levels. The first episode was kinda bland and didn't have that genuinely exciting buildup that other premieres had but it got better later on. Alex O'Loughlin gives Mick St. John a ""modern-day Sam Spade"" cynical edge to the character pure bliss along with Sophia Myles who gives the show a sense of heart and longing. And Jason Dohring is hilarious!! Injects the right amount of comic relief in dark noir atmosphere with brooding angst. Though I couldn't help notice the comparisons to Forever Night, for me, this show is fresh and more realistically gritty than what came before.",/review/rw1876545/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2007,dcreed,4," Another detective, just as dumb
","It seems that each detective show out there has some little quirk to it. The detective has OCD, they're a soccer mom, etc. But they all seem to be stone, cold stupid. ""Moonlight"", unfortunately, also falls into this category. Mick St. John (Alex O'Loughlin) is a vampire, but having been made immortal and, by the looks of his apartment, rich, he's not any brighter after being around for 90 years (60 as a vampire).",/review/rw1876545/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2007,MCL1150,7," Just another L.A. Vampire
","As a fan of the Buffy/Angel tandem, I just had to check out ""Moonlight"". The lead character is Mick St. John: Vampire/Detective. In the opening scene, done in fake interview style, they set up THEIR vampire ""rules"". Direct sunlight sickens him, but no bursting into flames. Crosses and holy water can't hurt him. He flippantly states that that only flame throwers can do him in. And get this! A wooden stake through the heart won't kill him. I mean, if you're going to do a vampire show, at least stick with the classics! Certainly no one would have accused them of stealing THAT one from Buffy/Angel. And Mick is not now nor has he ever been evil, and they totally gloss over the whole soul / no soul good & evil thing. In fact, he's a self described do good kind of guy. Come on, vamps have ALWAYS been evil. At least Joss Wheadon creatively dealt with WHY Angel was a vamp with an, um, heart. As for the similarities, vamp Mick St. John can be stabbed or shot, but heals fast. He also does that quick disappearing act thing and can leap up or down a flight of stairs in a single bound. He even drives a cool vintage black convertible like Angel does. I was surprised they didn't at least give him a Saab or a Volvo! And they must have hired ""Angel's"" film editor because the flash transitions between scenes look as if they've been lifted from ""Angel"" itself. In fact, the flash transition thing was such an ""Angel"" trademark, I can't believe they so obviously ""appropriated"" it for a show that was already being compared to its well known predecessor even before the first episode aired. ""Moonlight"" even shares something with ""The Rockford Files"", my all-time favorite show. Both Jim Rockford and Mick St. John are professional L.A. detectives who take on cases that they don't get paid for! What do they do for cash? But while Mick has a very nice apartment, Jim live in a beat up trailer. Mostly, episode one showed no real purpose for the vampire angle. Angel/Buffy dealt with ""actual"" monsters, dark magic and the occult. ""Moonlight"" is really trying to be ""Moonlighting"". A detective show with the cute blonde and good looking guy, but it doesn't have the humor or great writing. My advice for viewers? If you're a Buffy/Angel fan, watch once for laughs. If you're one of the producers, write David Boreanaz in as a vampire cousin who shows up every episode with a certain blonde girlfriend in tow. And toss in Andy Hallett for little color!",/review/rw1876545/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2018,lshantell,10," Revival request
",I believe this show was before it's time and need a chance to be revived on a network that has teenagers as well as middle aged viewers to get the ratings,/review/rw1876545/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2007,SiegeofVader,," I tried
","I tried to give this show a chance, keeping an open mind as I watched the first two episodes. But it was a sore disappointment. Here are my complaints: Firstly, the premise has been done to death. A vampire, opting to be a good guy, becomes a private investigator in Los Angeles. This plot rings a little reminiscent, doesn't it? The most recent example of this plot used is in the TV series Angel, which followed a vampire with a soul (a good vampire) as he becomes a private investigator in Los Angeles.",/review/rw1876545/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2007,purple_wolf13,8," A very sweet show despite the small clichés.
","With the t.v and movie genre getting bogged down with all of the new vampire flicks I thought ""Oh great not another thrown together show that'll be canceled after the third episode."" But after watching it, I was proved wrong. With me being a big fan of all and anything vampiric, I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, there are a few clichés here and there but I really enjoyed the first episode with the reference to the vampire cult case in Florida. Also, I absolutely loved the music from Evanesence. I'd say the only negative thing about this show is that the story line isn't that fresh. A P.I. and a reporter....it reminds me of Blood Ties on Lifetime. Maybe if the storyline was fresh more people would enjoy it. Though I did absolutely love the fact that they used the woman who played Isolde from Tristan and Isolde. I'm really excited about the future episodes. What can I say, I'm once again hooked.",/review/rw1876545/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2012,HelenMary,7," disappointed this didn't get a second season; a guilty pleasure
","I'm biased because I like toothy things, but I really do enjoy this and watch it quite frequently. I like the characters and story lines, it's not entirely original but is enjoyable and likable and it's ""vampire"" enough without any added extras (black magic/werewolves/fairies/sparkles etc) and the vampires are actually true to the genre (except the going out in broad daylight thing). The acting is sometimes a little cheesy but I overlook that because I like it so much and how do you act ""Hey I just found out vampires are real?"" It's not like anyone has a frame of reference is it? Alex O'Loughlin is excellent - I don't think I'd seen him before this - and I'm now a fan of him in Hawaii 5-0, and it's always nice to see Sophia Myles (Underworld), a Brit in an American Series. Good music, stunts and effects, this is an easy to watch show. Given the rubbish that IS given a second season, I have no clue why this didn't get one although where it ended was really nice and rounded it off well. Many familiar faces putting in an appearance, but the story arc with the beautiful Shannyn Sossamon was a favourite. ",/review/rw1876545/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2007,nickgamer20,4," Your average crime show...with vampires.
","OK, so I saw the premiere of this show, and I personally thought it had a little potential. But if this show keeps it the way it is, then it will be gone after the first season. For example, the writing is just terrible. It really makes it WAY too serious, and the very few jokes that are thrown in there, aren't funny at all. I know its a drama and everything, but every drama NEEDS some jokes in it. If it doesn't, than it just gets boring to watch the detectives just walk around. The reason I give it 4/10, is because there was some interesting interactions between Mick St. John and Beth, that could have been interesting, but they made the show a crime drama instead of a regular drama. I think it would have been a lot better if it wasn't a crime drama, and just a drama about Mick trying to get by as a vampire.",/review/rw1876545/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2008,mec7551,8," Welcome Moonlight
","Friday nights tend to be very boring. Moonlight while pure fantasy is well acted by up and coming Australian star Alex O'.I have seen him in a few movies and I believe that he will be with us for a long time. Sophia Miles is another one to look out for. As a big fan of Tristan and Isolde, her persona is one to have a future in whatever media form she chooses. As far as the show goes, it is one of my favorites. All the CSI's, NCIS.Without a Trace,Bones,and Criminal Minds have a great new neighbor. And it sure beats anything those silly game and so called ""reality"" shows give us CBS would be wise to keep Moonlight around for another season at least.",/review/rw1876545/?ref_=tt_urv

15 March 2009,gray1937-1,8," Is CBS as nuts as FOX? (Rant)
","Why do networks expect good Sci Fi to draw as much audience and rating as dumb reality shows? Don't they know that most Sci Fi fans either are scientists or engineers or at least have that potential? Don't they know that we are vastly outnumbered by the beer guzzling, chip munching, brain dead couch potatoes that watch ""Survivor Wherever,"" or ""Biggest (fat ass) Loser""? This, like ""Firefly"" was a fun show, requiring a little intelligence and attention to follow the plot. It had an attractive cast, Alex O'Loughlin, Sophia Myles, Jason Dohring, and Shannyn Sossamon who played well fleshed out characters in interesting situations.",/review/rw1876545/?ref_=tt_urv

28 September 2007,thenationalzero,," CBS should stick to the Evening News
","Mediocre. Cheesy dialogue. Bad acting. Worn premise. The 'Don't I know you from somewhere Oh no I guess I just have a familiar face' routine. There's really nothing that would keep you watching this show, unless you had nothing better to do, which was my sad predicament. After an hour when I asked myself what was good about this show, nothing came to mind. I mean, we've seen this all before - there's really nothing original at all. So if you were bummed about the end of Angel, or even Forever Knight, you could watch this and sort-of relive the glory days. Sort-of, because those other shows were so much better (at least for their time). Did I mention the bad acting and cheesy dialogue? The final minutes took bad to a whole 'nother dimension - they started playing some Evanessence and Celine Dion. *ugh* Avoid this shtick at all costs. Go do some homework. Go clean out your closet. Go take out the trash. This will probably be on for at least one whole season before they even CONSIDER cancelling it.",/review/rw1876545/?ref_=tt_urv

20 May 2008,hannah8700-1,10," A Different Kind of Love Story
","This show definitely has something! At first, I thought that it was going to be one of those gory, fake, slasher vampire shows that have absolutely no point to them, but when my cousin turned it on I really got into the plot and the stories behind each of the characters. So it was really quite the opposite and better than I expected. I have only seen one episode, which actually turned out to be the season finale ""Sonata,"" and I am already obsessed with it. Now I can hardly wait for the next season to start. I've already spent hours on You Tube watching clips of past episodes. I'm completely hooked! The two main characters Mick and Beth played by Alex O'Loughlin and Sophia Myles have such great chemistry together. And Mick St. John is just so sexy. No mere mortal could resist! I'm also finding that I really love the songs they play on the show. Often times they really make the scene. All in all, ""Moonlight"" is a great show and I'm excited for Season 2.",/review/rw1876545/?ref_=tt_urv
