22 October 2018,ThomDerd,8," Good movie. Good fun. Tom Hardy is in all the scenes.
","Venom is about the symbiotic relationship of man and alien, with the latter being the gross one. Funny at times, with a lovely performance from Tom Hardy -if you are a fan of mr Hardy, this is going to be entertaining for you.
First half goes very well in terms of setting the story and the venom universe, second part is more about action and there it has a few flaws but it is still fun and interesting to watch.
It is a cool view on the ""almost anti-hero"" venom/eddie character that kept my attention.
I had a good time watching this in the theaters and i ll definitely have a second view when it comes out in bray or dvd.
So, all in all its def not the best action film of all times or even of 2018...but dont have too high expectations and you will definitely like it.
8/10.",/review/rw4375351/?ref_=tt_urv

12 June 2020,Ch4ndler_B1ng,7," It's not terrible like critics make it out to be, but it's not great like audiences make it out to be
","This movie is kind of a mixed bag. There are certain elements of it that I think are creative, but by far it is definitely one of the lesser Marvel films. The only thing I disagree with Martin Scorsese about is that ""Marvel movies are like theme park rides"" because there are ones like Endgame, Thor Ragnarok (my personal favourite Marvel movie), Civil War, The Avengers, Infinity War and many others that have a far deeper meaning and much more than just entertainment. Overall, Venom is one of those okay movies that doesn't deserve hate, the scenes where the Venom inside Tom Hardy's character is talking to him are pretty hilarious.",/review/rw4375351/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2018,claudio_carvalho,7," Funny and Entertaining
","""Venom"" is a funny and entertaining film based on a Marvel antihero Venom with reasonable storyline, awesome special effects and weak and annoying villain performed by the awful Riz Ahmed. However, Tom Hardy has good performance in the role of the clumsy loser Eddie Brock and Michelle Williams complete the lead cast. This film is also the chance to see Stan Lee in his last cameo. My vote is seven.",/review/rw4375351/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2018,GuanXing,9," Very fun movie
","I don't know what's going on with all the negative reviews. People are really hard to please! 
I went to see that movie without any real expectations and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

17 October 2018,TheLittleSongbird,5," Not so venomous
","Do have a fondness for superhero films. 'Venom' also had talented people in the cast, Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams have both done great work in their careers, it looked interesting and found myself really fascinated to watch an origins story of one of the most interesting anti-heroes in the superhero universe.",/review/rw4375351/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2018,SnoopyStyle,8," solid stand-alone origin story
","In San Francisco, struggling reporter Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is ordered to do a puff piece on bio-tech mogul Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), the head of Life Foundation. Drake's spacecraft crashed after retrieving symbiotic lifeforms from a comet. Brock gets fired for asking tough questions to Drake and his fianc√©e Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) leaves him. Drake starts experimenting on people. Scientist Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate) turns whistle-blower and sneaks Brock into the research facility. There, Brock is exposed to the symbiote Venom.",/review/rw4375351/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2018,krazy-mm,8," Good intro for Venom, but now I want more!
","Had a test screening tonight in cinema I work at, and couldn't wait to watch my all-time favorite Marvel (anti) hero on big screen.
Tom Hardy is great as always, that guy really can act. Can't think of anyone else who would be a better choice for the role but him.
Introduction was really long, but I was not bored for a second. When Venom comes in his true form - the party starts! Wish few action scenes were less like Michael Bay's style (hardly see anything) but the inner child in me was really happy for Venom's maniacal kicking and punching around. Venom's character is really well made visually - his walking, jumping and smashing are just like in the comic books - thumbs up for that!",/review/rw4375351/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," This film would have been much better if it wasn't for the bad writing.
","You would think one of the 5 (why?) writers could have gotten this right. Tom Hardy was amazing, the directing excellent, cinematography on point, V/SFX not bad, but the story was very loose and had plot and pacing issues. Venom's voice was also annoying. You would think the producers would have hired better writers instead of pathetically paying for almost every review on here 9 and above being fake (pretty much only film reviewed). I may have given this film a 7 or 8 out of 10, but only gets a 6 for the fake reviews. For me it could have been much better and deserving of the 9's and 10's had the writing been tighter. Nevertheless, still enjoyable, but sadly only a 6/10 from me, mainly for the fake reviews that piss me off.",/review/rw4375351/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2019,kosmasp,7," How much Venom is it(?)
","I get it, even the people who may already hit the not helpful button, before reading this. You see my rating and go: ""no way"". And I get it in the sense, that I haven't read the comics as much as many people who were expecting and hoping this would go ""R""-rated. Of course this stretches the boundaries of PG-13, because it is quite violent. But it will never be enough from what I heard from people who know the comics.",/review/rw4375351/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2018,marvinho-67055,9," Incredible Tom Hardy performance

",What an incredibly average film.,/review/rw4375351/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2018,TheMovieDoctorful,9," Wow...It ACTUALLY Tried Something Different!
","Wow...Something different...Something ACTUALLY different. No, Venom is no masterpiece. It's not perfect. It's not quite as great as I hoped it would be, but...It's ACTUALLY something different. And in an age where Marvel and DC give us the same comic book movie 500 times a year, that's incredibly high praise. Let me clarify; despite what you've been told, Venom is not a superhero movie. Venom is, at its heart, a horror comedy monster flick. It has much more in common in its characters, story, tone, comedy and action sequences with An American Werewolf in London or Evil Dead than, say, The Avengers or The Dark Knight. That's a wildly inventive and different take on the genre and enough to give it some much needed, genuine diversity.",/review/rw4375351/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2018,bhester0806,10," AWESOME

5 October 2018,Prashast_Singh,10," Venom is electrifying!
",I knew it. ,/review/rw4375351/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2018,tresm87,9," Venom is an ambitiously accurate portrayal of the anti hero comic character that sets itself apart from the formulaic MCU as a highly entertaining standalone origin story.
","While it may break away from the comics slightly by not including the Spiderman origin story, the true characterization integrity within Eddie Brock/Venom is vibrant and extremely close to source material. The story alteration might even improve the overall direction of this new standalone Venom series because now we can truly focus on Brock/venom and not have Parker/Spiderman constantly take away from his attention. I believe we've had enough of Spiderman, and honestly after the travesty that was Homecoming imho, I'm fine with that for now. ",/review/rw4375351/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2018,ThomasDrufke,1," A Real Turd in the Wind
","So here's the thing, there isn't a single part of this movie that I liked. I can see where some people found it to be stupid entertainment and silly fun, but that's not exactly the way I like movies. There are always exceptions, but with a cast like Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, and Woody Harrelson (sort of), I expect a lot more. The script for this film is by far one of the worst things put to film over the last few years. I flat out laughed out loud at how bad some of these lines were. And by no means did I think most of this humor was intentional. If you watch any of the trailers for the film, they are pitching a serious & dark take on the Venom character, so don't give me the whole ""it's supposed to bad"" take. That's just not true. You can forget ever seeing Spider-Man show up in these movies, at least if Sony/Marvel wants me to take him seriously at all. There's no sense in going through and ripping apart each and every part of this film, just know that I disliked the entire thing. Nope, I take that back, I hated it.",/review/rw4375351/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,4," You can't polish a turd, but they could've at least tried.
","'Venom (2018)' is usually just fine, but it never comes close to being properly engaging or even all that entertaining. It just constantly skirts the line between being pretty decent and just downright boring. This - combined with its overall weak, poorly paced narrative and its general technical choppiness (including noticeably 'jumpy' editing and several scenes that are strangely blurry, to the point that it seems like the focus-puller might've been asleep) - means that the overall experience isn't all that good. The film certainly lands with a whimper rather than a roar. It actually takes ages for Brock to become the eponymous big boy and, when he does, the dynamic between him and his newfound companion never comes close to being fully formed or even consistent. This means that we can't really relate to - or care for - either of them and that their motivations don't really make all that much sense. Their relationship is supposed to be the driving force of the story, yet it doesn't naturally evolve and never comes close to being compelling. To make matters worse, the whole thing culminates in an awful, CG mess of a finale that's literally difficult to watch, much less comprehend. It inexplicably goes back on several core conceits simply to have our symbiotic lead emerge as a more 'traditional' hero, despite the piece being billed as a decidedly 'villainous' affair. The feature is pretty tame in general, to be honest. It all just comes across as more of poor man's 'Upgrade (2018)' than anything else. Don't even get me started on the absolute joke of an end-credits scene. 4/10.",/review/rw4375351/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2018,MichaelNontonMulu,8," The Origin Movie of Anti-hero from Spider-man Universe
","Movie was slow in the first half hour and only became exciting after Eddie and Venom became one. Special effects were quite awesome, some of the fight scenes (chasing sequence and climax fight scenes) were amazing. The interaction between Eddie and Venom were quite funny at times.",/review/rw4375351/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2018,ufarese,8," Do yourself a favour...ignore the critics!
",We just came out of the theatre and I can honestly say. I liked it! It was funny and it paid great homage to the Todd McFarlane bombastic Venom era of the late 90's. It truly baffles me that Sony would not take enough risks to release the film with an R rating. I wonder how much of this film was left on the cutting floor!?! Tom Hardy's performance is also on point and...just go see it.,/review/rw4375351/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2018,quincytheodore,6," Tom Hardy is barely keeping Venom alive
","Spider-Man has been a personal favorite super hero of mine. Despite the debacle with different studios and without having Spider-Man, I personally rooted Venom to succeed. However, the jarring tonal shift, occasional clumsy dialogues and heavy reliance on CGI are eerie reminisces of less sophisticated super hero movie from early 2000. It's disappointing because there are some good set pieces here and Tom Hardy tries his damn hardest.",/review/rw4375351/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2018,AdrenalinDragon,5," Not enough Venom injected to make a good movie
","Believe it or not, I had hopes that Venom might have been good. Not great, just good. Those expectations fell not too far into the movie, before Venom even showed up. The jokes were falling flat, everyone was getting frustrated with Eddie (Tom Hardy) being quite irritating, and nothing much entertaining was happening on-screen. We were all waiting for Venom to actually appear.",/review/rw4375351/?ref_=tt_urv
