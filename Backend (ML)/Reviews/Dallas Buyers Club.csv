21 April 2020,peterrichboy,3," Overrated nonsense
","I had heard so many good things about this show. The most watched show in Europe, Spain's biggest ever viewing figures etc. Then from a promising start the program just gets more and more ridiculous. Now I know it's just apiece of entertaining fictional drama but half the skill in making a show like this is to get the audience to think as far fetched as the plot is a part of you would like to think it could be done.",/review/rw5954701/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2020,Silent_Rocco,3," I don't get the hype
","With a 100% positive critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes and with many of my friends going crazy for it, my opition might not be very popular. But I find La Casa de Papel (Money Heist) to be utterly ridiculous, overly melodramatic and just plain stupid.",/review/rw5954701/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2019,grantss,5," Clever and intriguing, initially, but gets dumber and dumber the longer it goes on
","A band of robbers, lead by a man known simply as 'the Professor', infiltrate and rob the Spanish National Mint. They appear to bungle it, ending up holed up in the Mint with 67 hostages. But it's all part of the Professor's plan. If it succeeds, they'll make off with over $2 billion Euros.",/review/rw5954701/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2020,arjunrajkss,6," Could have stopped in season 2
","If they could have stopped in season 2, this series would have been the best ever heist series that's ever made. But they didn't do it and season 3 and season 4 is meaningless and boring. Not convincing and illogical.",/review/rw5954701/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2020,s3276169,5," Why season 3?
",I gave season one and two of this show a much deserved 10/10 but I'm at a loss to understand why they made season 3?,/review/rw5954701/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Glad I finally gave this a chance!
","I've heard about how good Money Heist is since it started back in 2017 but for some reason I kept put off watching it. I finally gave in and started watching it recently and now I can't stop, it's every bit as good as everyone says it is. Some of it is absolutely ridiculous but that won't stop you from having fun watching it. The writing and acting are both excellent, there are so many twists and surprises that it will keep you on the edge of your seat and guessing throughout the entire series! It's a Spanish show but you can either watch it with subtitles or watch it dubbed in English. Just a little warning...once you start watching it it's hard to stop, you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible!",/review/rw5954701/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2021,Otte1,3," Starts great....stop watching after Season 1...you will thank me
","Season 1 was top notch
Season 2 kept the intense drama going but started dropping close to end
Season 3 We are trailing off, plot devices no longer making sense
Season 4 It became obvious that the writers was just writing the craziest stuff possible and throwing it on screen.",/review/rw5954701/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2021,Her-Excellency,6," Ridiculously Overrated

20 April 2020,viktor-hristovski,4," dont be fooled by the ratings
","This is a soap opera, looks like a smart tv show but it's a latin soap opera and you watch it like that(50% brain turned off, the logic part)",/review/rw5954701/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2020,SimonSaysSmallScreen,1," Bad. Dumb and bad. Just really bad.
","Let's start with the initial premise: occupying the mint, printing up 2.4 billion in 50-Euro notes, and stealing them. That many notes would weigh 43,200 Kg and occupy a minimum of 29 standard CEN-pallets (each stacked a ridiculous 2.7 meters high), which is five more than will fit in a 40-ft container. The narration tells us they printed 200 million in the first 8 hours, so the whole lot would take 96 hours (4 days), and then it all has to be cut, stacked, wrapped and loaded. So they have to continue their occupation for, say, all together 7 days without the police taking the standard step of CUTTING OFF THE POWER. Then they have to get all that bulk removed, taken to another location, and then what are they going to do with it? Divide it amongst them? Each of them then has at least two pallets, 3,000 Kg, of bulk to carry away?",/review/rw5954701/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2020,genisis_tp,2," What a waste of time!!
","I really dont get it, what do these high ratings see in this series. This is the most dumbest heist i have ever seen. You plan something for years, you train people for months and then what? During the heist they fight among themselves? Forced soap opera level drama in a heist story. Dumbest series ever!",/review/rw5954701/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2020,joachimokeefe,1," Really bad soap opera. Worse than a school production. Not even laughable.
","You know how it is on a foreign trip. You turn on the hotel TV and if you're not fluent in the language, you zone out and half-follow the picture. And then you have your typical soap opera actors - some of them can't act, but are photogenic, some of them can sort of act and aren't photogenic, and some of them are required only to pretend to be in a coma. Most of them overact (or over non-act), because the scarcity of acting work means they've never come up against a decent director who would have told them to tone it down a bit. Even the guy in a coma.",/review/rw5954701/?ref_=tt_urv

7 September 2021,aliahmadi72,7," Do yourself a favor, don't watch season 3, 4 and 5
","La casa de papel started as a promising bold show. The first and second season had amusing and strong plot. Well defined characters and a storyline that could certainly catch your attention. The duel and chess between the protagonist and antagonist was surprising and full of ups and downs. Of course there were plot holes but you could overlook them in favor of the overall strength of story. The whole idea was bold and well developed, all and all, the ending was satisfying and well-written too.",/review/rw5954701/?ref_=tt_urv

","Over-acting from every single idiotic character who all do idiotic things for reasons unfathomable to any normal functioning human on the face of the earth.
I couldn't handle more than 3 episodes of the first season. That is a chunk of my life I'll never get back!

4 September 2021,PaulieDHO,4," and we thought stormtroopers were bad
","No matter how hard they try with the story, it's impossible to sit there and not burst out laughing or cringe at every scene with guns. They should just take as much of the shooting aspect out of this show as possible because nothing's funnier than seeing 10 people shoot with unlimited magazines/bullets and missing every single shot. I just can't take this show seriously.",/review/rw5954701/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2020,tert72,1," NOT the best show since breaking bad....
","I've noticed a LOT, A LOT of the fake positive reviews mention breaking bad, that should tell you one thing. The plot sucks, you plan for months and you get this kiddy crap going on? Maybe I don't understand how stuff works in Europe, but a good show should make it seem somewhat real. There is nothing that feels real about the show. Gonna be in the building for days and yet they ""want"" a loose cannon on the team???? Not sure about the acting as I was listening in dubbed English, so can't say much about that. But the plot holes....... A well written show???? What???? Take a totally inept police force, and lucky as hell robbers, and you have this show.",/review/rw5954701/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2019,dierregi,1," Lady detective talks to mummy when going gets tough
","A motley gang of criminals spend five months under the supervision of the hyper-annoying Professor, to learn how to pull off the heist of the millennium. If the premise sounds stupid, it's because it is. The Professor must possess infinite time and resources to select his gang, prepare the plan, organise the ""lessons"", rent a house in a secluded location, feed himself and the gang for months, etc...",/review/rw5954701/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,martin_merelesc,9," Quintessential Spanish heist drama
","The core of the series revolves around several elements that are highly popular with viewers: action, romance, comedy, suspense, and even heartwarming moments that help sympathize with criminals. It is fair to say that the plot presents several moments of anguish throughout the different seasons, where the characters' character and loyalty to the group are tested. The creator of this series, which is based in the city of Madrid, Álex Pina, has managed to make the series live a natural progression, coming to offer in its last season something that has power, a little oxygen to the disturbing climate that lives in history.",/review/rw5954701/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2020,deloudelouvain,8," Watch it in Spanish.
","All my friends were talking about La Casa De Papel (I really don't get why you have to call it Money Heist) as it was the best series ever so I was really curious and excited to watch it. I waited a long time to start watching it but once I started I binge watched the first four seasons. So yes I admit it, it is addictive, you can't help to want to know what will happen in the next episode. That said the plot itself is sometimes very far fetched, in other words it would never happen like that in real life. The Professor thinks about every move the police will make, and that's fine, but sometimes it's just very unlikely and just a bit exaggerated. For that alone I can't rate this, for the rest excellent series, with a higher score. The cast is really good though, every actor did a great job, from the most annoying one to the heroes. Everyone will have their favorite character, some will die and some will survive, that what makes this show really entertaining, the not knowing what will happen. I strongly advise you watch this show in it's original language Spanish instead of watching it dubbed. It only adds to the excellent acting. I once tried to watch a dubbed thing, it's just awful, and I really don't get what people like about lips being out of synch. Can't wait for season five, let's bring it on.",/review/rw5954701/?ref_=tt_urv
