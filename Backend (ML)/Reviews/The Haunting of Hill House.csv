19 October 2022,jtindahouse,8," A captivating true story
",I was around 90 minutes into the 'The Stranger' when I finally clicked that I had listened to a podcast about this story back in 2017. It had captivated me back then and it was captivating me again now in movie form. If you are the type that doesn't usually enjoy true stories don't be put off. This one is a doozy.,/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2022,arungeorge13,7," A Sean Harris performance you won't forget! [+65%]
","The most noticeable thing about this slow-burn Aussie crime drama is how it tonally wavers yet never loosens its chokehold on the viewers. There were moments where I thought The Stranger was going to take a psychological horror route, but then it's quick to revert to its drama-thriller backdrop. The first act doesn't give away a lot, with both Edgerton and Harris coming across as strangers we're trying to dissect.",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2022,pangipingu,7," Worth it!
","Australian crime dramas have always kept me on edge despite their knack for the implication of violence rather than actually showing it on the big screen. Wright's peculiar style of narration, unraveling the story in a somewhat unconventional style, actually amplifies the impact the story leaves on the audience.",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2022,albertval-69560,7," Deceived by a Sting
","As the film acknowledges, this is based on a true story. The name of the victim and the perpetrator have been changed. And the focus of the story is not how the crime was committed but on the rather elaborate sting operation to lure the killer and induce him to confess to the abduction and murder of the boy.",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2022,tsh332,9," Just excellent
","Easily the most tension film I have watched in years. The story is riveting, dark, and complex. As someone with 32 years in law enforcement, including undercover activity (far sumpler and more short term than what is portrayed in this film), I'll assert this was a masterpiece that definitely had some experienced technical advisors. My wife and I were both transfixes by the journey of both the suspect and the undercover as they slowly and carefully inched toward the revelation of the truth. Not a film I would let any child under 13 watch, possibly even a couple years older. It's a great film, but certainly not easy to watch at many points.",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2022,Genti25,7," A Very Competent Film
","I've recently watched a bunch of low budget horror and thriller films due to the fact that we're in October right now, but one slugfest after another brought me to The Stranger.",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2022,missingspace,8," Best Netflix film in a long time.

15 December 2022,paul-allaer,8," Harrowing psychological crime drama from Down Under
","As ""The Stranger "" (2022 release from Australia; 116 min) opens, we are introduced to Paul and Henry, 2 strangers who strike up a conversation on an overnight bus drive (think Greyhound). They gain each other's trust, and at Paul's invite, Henry joins him for an unspecified job Paul must do for Mark. ""No violence!. Pleads Henry, and he agrees to join us. At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2022,zac-04879,7," A Slow, Captivating and Dark Film that Defines the Term ""Not-for-Everyone""
","The Stranger is a darkly spoken and sometimes convoluted, yet an incredibly bleak and stomach-churning Australian true crime drama that's tough to think about and not for everyone. A viewer doesn't need to know or have even really heard about the Daniel Morcombe case, in which The Stranger is based on catching the child's killer, to see the obvious strength and effort put into this movie, although it's completely easy to see why the reviews are so mixed, and why others hated this movie and thought it was boring and dull.",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2022,Otte1,4," Intriguing but the pacing
","This film is slow, really slow which is not a problem if there is character building or slowing increasing tension with a payoff. That does not happen here. It is just slow in the ending as the beginning. The problem is the movie/director is splicing in about four separate stories with flashbacks without any context. I was almost an hour in the film and not sure who was who or why. By the time I did understand what was happening you are expecting a big reveal based upon the four convoluted stories that is forced upon you to decipher. When there was no 'big reveal' you start questioning why the director forced those flashbacks that did not go anywhere.",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2022,middlehitter-92234,9," It's Complicated
","This movie demands constant attention while seemingly nothing is really happening. Two men meet and one, the friend, introduces the other, the Stranger, to an opportunity in a criminal enterprise that looks like a smuggling ring for a black market but nothing seems to come of it. Through out the film there is an intensity to the stranger the exudes menace. As they go about mundane tasks to wipe out traces of some unexplained crime, the stranger is forced to reveal more and more of his past to assure the leaders of the criminal group that he is being forthright with them.",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2022,p0t80,8," That's some heavy stuff.
","Very dark and gritty. Slow paced, psychological tension built up to a point where I was rly unnerved and uncomfortable, in an awesome way.",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2022,ronaldsonphil,5," Good acting but oh so slow and too long
","As an Australian I'm familiar with this awful abduction case in Queensland where a young boy was waiting for a bus, one failed to stop for him and he was never seen again. The bus driver who failed to stop must be feeling terrible. The film starts well and ends well but there is at least 30 minutes of filler in the middle that was nonsense that could've been discarded to make a tighter film. I almost turned off as it was so annoying. Great acting by the two lead characters let down by a poor script that meandered all over the place. A lot of the under cover stuff seemed to go nowhere and became very peripheral to the case.",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2022,Weary76,8," For going in spoiler-free, don't read the reviews (it's worth it)

20 October 2022,stu-tang,9," A much better film than most people give credit for
","If you enjoyed True Detective, Killing Them Softly or The Place Beyond The Pines, then you'll like this film.",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2022,Xstal,7," The Anglers...
","You can run, and you can hide, when you live on the outside, mislead, deceive, dupe and beguile to avoid going to trial, in a world of crooks and cons, there's no rights and many wrongs, present your hooks in an array, and you'll surely catch your prey.",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2022,norbert-plan-618-715813,8," Superb exercise of style
","A very beautiful film with a strong atmosphere and a measured rhythm, where a policeman infiltrates a community of thugs to track down a child killer. Joel Edgerton is this policeman, who lives in permanent stress, illustrated with his scenes of his family life, that is to say with his son, of whom he has the custody from time to time. But undercover cop and father life are not easy. The one he tracks is Sean Harris, in a subtle interpretation, to draw a character on which it is hard to have a psychological grip. The plot and the script work perfectly the subject: during the whole film, we wonder if he is the killer wanted for these murders of children. The last quarter will give us the explanations.",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2022,kjjames81,4," Don't believe the high ratings
",Just finished watching this movie and while I am a fan of both of the main actors and yes it was nice to see them in a film together but this was a waste of their combined talents.,/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2022,mrashtastic89,5," Strange how disappointing this film was
","Out of all the mediocre Netflix originals I've seen this year, I'm pretty sure The Stranger takes the cake for the most disappointing, it's weird how I was actually excited to watch it, I'd heard great things but it just didn't do it for me.",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2022,ricardo-consonni,2," The movie is very slow - and then it ends
","Actors are very good, but it seems their talent is wasted, in this sorry excuse of a screenplay. At first, I was intrigued by the dark, complex characters. But the pace was so slooooow, you really have to put a lot of effort, to make it it to the end.",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2022,movieman6-413-929510,4," For a second directorial work, the director is still somewhat of a stranger in this area.
",The Stranger is a new crime drama directed and written by Thomas M. Wright. This is only the second film he has directed and the first he has written independently.,/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2022,radhrh,1," Excruciating
","Filmed in the style of one of those Scandinavian cop shows popular a few years back, The Stranger is an excruciating experience much like being trapped in a lift for two hours with a 13 year old goth explaining the lyrics of Joy Division. The plot, which is claimed to be a true story concerns an elaborate cop entrapment scenario where a drifter suspected of being a serial killer is inducted into a fake organised crime network in the hope he will spill the beans about abducting a young boy some 10 years previously. This requires the co-ordinated efforts of literally dozens of cops posing as criminals across several police jurisdictions. Not really convincing. The whole is filmed in virtual darkness where the protagonists stare into the far distance while mumbling incoherent jibberish. Not that you can hear what they are saying due to the omnipresent durge of a soundtrack. I lasted an hour waiting for something to happen but it never did so I reached for the remote. Why can't Netflix make a half decent movie? And while I'm here, get a shave and a hair cut!",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2022,julieshotmail,5," Slow fictionalization of true events
","From the get-go this movie seems dark, firstly in the literal sense as you can barely see anything most of the time, and also it surrounds a heavy real-life subject matter. The acting is top-notch; unfortunately it can only take you so far as this movie moves at the excruciating pace of a turtle. I honestly am falling asleep 20 minutes into it. It tries to be moody, dreary, and bleak, but ambience is all there is, because not much happens until close to the end. Its ambition to be a deep character study is squandered by the long pauses, dream sequences, and overall fillers. A documentary or a 50-minute dramatization would have served the viewers much better.",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,EmmeCHammer,9," Second straight
","This is the second crime thriller Aussie movie in two years and I'm becoming a fan. At first I was hesitant because it's hard to keep up with the accent in dark gloomy quiet dialect that these movies need to be authentic, but we do have subtitles, although sometimes they(subtitles) take a little bit out of the viewing experience.",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2022,Headturner11,5," And a half
","Again I watch a movie and am disappointed. Another film that just shows random bits and pieces and does it some what well but a story has a beginning, middle and a solid end. We son't get that. We Meet Henry and Paul and the rest is one jumbled fog. I watch mostly Australian series, films and am not really aware of any of these actors but I do believe Sean Harris to be the best actor of the lot. Joel Edgerton is also good in his role but the synopsis says he's hiding a secret?!? If so I missed that? I also wondered how much are they spending on a old case with insufficient evidence?!? It never really goes into what happened in Henrys past. His past crimes etc. Also Marks character? We know he has a son and that's about it. In fact I just awoke and wanted to write a review but I'm going to do some research into the actual case. Now if I have to do that then that means the movie didn't do it's job.",/review/rw8624372/?ref_=tt_urv
