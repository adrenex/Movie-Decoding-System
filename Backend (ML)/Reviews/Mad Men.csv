25 August 2022,MrDHWong,7," Works well with its interesting premise and features some solid performances from its cast
","""The Black Phone"" is a horror film based on the short story of the same name by Joe Hill. Directed by Scott Derrickson (""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"", ""Doctor Strange"") and starring Ethan Hawke, it works well with its interesting premise and features some solid performances from its cast.",/review/rw8399242/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2022,Polotovar,6," I wish there was more depth to the story
","In the end, I'm disappointed. It started off fine, but it stayed fine for the rest of the film and in short I was expecting something more than just fine. I was waiting for some questions to be answered, some revelations, some explanations. I was most puzzled by the ending, which seemed too quick, almost cut off. Not to criticize, I liked the time setting. It added a bit of magic. At least for me. Summary. Bottom line. It was okay, but I was expecting a little more. A little more depth to the story. I missed some revelation or explanation. For me, an above average horror film that I would only recommend to fans of the genre.",/review/rw8399242/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2022,Bonitao,7," Could have been so much more.
","Starting from a really good and somewhat original premise, it's not because it addresses a repeated theme (Kidnapper and a basement) that it's generic or copy, it's the same as saying that every mafia movie is a copy of The Godfather.",/review/rw8399242/?ref_=tt_urv

17 July 2022,Tweetienator,7," Twisted Good
","Indeed, well entertained I was - a fine cast and solid production (takes us back to the late 70s), and that blend of thriller with a good shot of supernatural horror made The Black Phone a nice entertaining trip. The cast is really good, especially the younger ones too. Recommended if you like such movies as The Lovely Bones, Split, Chained (Vincent D'Onofrio), House at the End of the Street and so on.",/review/rw8399242/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2022,ubasarsahin,6," You don't have to rate a film higher just because it's popular or loved from other people..
",I was so hyped and hopeful for this movie for a long time but I'd never thought I would find it overrated. I haven't read the book despite the fact that I'm a huge fan of Joe Hill and Stephen King and their common stories but unfortunately I couldn't like this one so much. I don't find it neither unique nor original at all among their other stories.,/review/rw8399242/?ref_=tt_urv

",Judging by the reviews this really seems to be quite a polarising film. I'm not sure what some of the lower scores would have wanted to see maybe seeing children getting tortured and then killed on screen perhaps I dunno?,/review/rw8399242/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,claudio_carvalho,8," The Phone From Beyond
","In 1978, in Denver, the siblings Finney (Mason Thames) and Gwen Blake (Madeleine McGraw) live with his widower alcoholic father Terrence (Jeremy Davies). They miss their mother, who had psychic abilities and committed suicide. Finney is bullied at school by three mates, but his friend Robin (Miguel Cazarez Mora) defends him. When a child abductor known as ""The Grabber"" kidnaps a boy named Bruce (Tristan Pravong), Gwen has a dream and mentions reference to black balloons unknown by the public. Detectives Wright (E. Roger Mitchell) and Miller (Troy Rudeseal) come to the school to interview Gwen, but they do not believe in her statement. But when Finney is abducted by ""The Grabber"", he is locked in a soundproof basement and learns that the black phone on the wall is disconnected. But out of the blue, Finney receives phone calls from the beyond.",/review/rw8399242/?ref_=tt_urv

",I saw a horror movie with a score over 7 and I fell for it again.,/review/rw8399242/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2022,laragi,5," Mediocre
",The phone ringing added a great amount of tension at times. The film itself has too much going on that doesn't fit. Too many unanswered questions at the end. A little more development and it would have had a chance.,/review/rw8399242/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2022,masonsaul,8," Great crowd pleasing horror
",The Black Phone takes a while to get going but once it does it delivers plenty of tense moments without a complete reliance on jump scares with a consistently unsettling atmosphere and lots of satisfying moments of set up and pay off.,/review/rw8399242/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2022,IonicBreezeMachine,9," The Black Phone reunites Sinister's Scott Derrickson, C. Robert Cargill, and Ethan Hawke for an intense and terrifying ride.
","Set in North Denver, Colorado in 1978, brother and sister Finney (Mason Thames) and Gwen (Madeleine McGraw) live with their drunken abusive father Terrence (Jeremy Davies). Finney is abducted by a serial child snatcher/murderer known as The Grabber (Ethan Hawke) who locks Finney in a soundproofed basement before eventually escalating to killing him. Inside the basement is a black phone that is disconnected, but despite this it rings and Finney answers it and hears the voices of The Grabber's previous victims who give him hints and clues to how Finney can fight back against the Grabber. Meanwhile Gwen experiences vivid dreams that are tied to The Grabber and tries to find her brother before it's too late.",/review/rw8399242/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,Amthermandes,8," Downright creepy
","Dark, and very well done, this is an edge-of-your-seat horror/thriller about a boy trying to survive his encounter with a SINISTER child serial killer, and a supernatural phone.",/review/rw8399242/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," A solid, tense thriller with some nice twists.
","The 103 min runtime and decent pacing was cleverly used to maintain atmospheric and unnerving constant suspense. The directing and cinematography was spot-on with an excellent score. Casting and performances were great, especially Ethan Hawke and the feisty and talented Madeleine McGraw, who stole the spotlight. Sure it could've used some more gore and guts, but that would've made the story less authentic and too cheesy. It's a great film well put together for the horror-thriller genre.",/review/rw8399242/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2021,Zaid_Khoury,7," Yeah, Ethan Hawke at it again.
","Ethan Hawke is at it again, I loved the vibe of the movie, director came in clutch with this movie, it was truly surprising. Didn't expect it to be even remotely good, when this movie does fully release in theaters please do watch it in the big screens you will not regret it, child actors are incredible. I thought i saw the whole movie in the trailers, oh boy I was wrong.",/review/rw8399242/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2022,tom992,5," Not that good
","It was not bad and not good, there is no horror in this movie, the story is poor and poorly executed. I'm baffled at all the good reviews, I think it's all very overrated, people saying that it's the best horror movie?? They probably never saw any horror movie.",/review/rw8399242/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2022,shahrad,6," Just Ok,...
","Thought it would be better. It's entertaining, yes, but has lots of plot holes. We have seen much better movies with similar stories. However, we see great performances mostly from Ethan Hawke. He is really twisted and creepy here.",/review/rw8399242/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2022,doorsscorpywag,2," Hopeless rubbish.

5 August 2022,MovieQween-33622,6," Trailer is the entire movie, no surprises
","I had been waiting to see this film all year! The first trailer was so enticing and so unique, sure to be creepy! I loved this concept and Ethan Hawke's masked villain. Also loved Finny and Gwen, they were absolutely amazing actors who carried this film!",/review/rw8399242/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,tresm87,8," The Hawke and Derrickson duo take the horror genre back once again with a grimly entertaining film.
","After what seems like forever since we had anything close to being a mainstream horror release over the past year, The long awaited delayed Black Phone is finally here. Let me start out by saying just how excited I was to see Scott Derrickson and Ethan Hawke team up once again after the massively underrated and disturbing ""Sinister"" in 2013. Derrickson has directed some absolute gems while still remaining slightly under the radar. Hawke's versatility has always proved effective when he dabbles into the horror genre. So with a duo like this you're bound for success.",/review/rw8399242/?ref_=tt_urv
