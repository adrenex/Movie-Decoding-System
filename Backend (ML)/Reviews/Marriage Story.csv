19 February 2006,bkoganbing,9," The Saga of Saigo Takamori
","Although the central character is American mercenary Tom Cruise, the story of The Last Samurai is about the little known to occidentals event of the Samurai revolt of 1877 led by Saigo Takamori who operates under a different character name and is played flawlessly by Ken Watanabe. Changing his name much like the way Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan were under different names in Inherit the Wind allowed for some dramatic and historic license.",/review/rw2139664/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Great Samurai
","A fascinating and inspiring epic, The Last Samurai is a powerful film. The story follows a disillusioned Civil War veteran who's recruited to train the Japanese army in Western warfare as they prepare to take on a Samurai rebellion. Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe lead the cast and give excellent performances. The directing is also quite remarkable, and captures the spiritual aspects of nature and of the Samurai culture. Additionally, the writing does an effective job at depicting the culture clashes, and at developing the characters. The score by Hans Zimmer is brilliantly done as well, perfectly complementing the film and enhancing the themes. The Last Samurai is a smart and passionate drama that's well-crafted and compelling.",/review/rw2139664/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," Spellbinding
","A beautifully done film, and a sweeping and spellbinding epic in every sense. The Last Samurai is exquisitely shot, with stunning locations, wonderful cinematography and well designed costumes. The music by the ever reliable Hans Zimmer is gorgeous, dramatic in the battle sequences, and poignant in the slower scenes. Speaking of the battle sequences they were extremely well staged and came across as spine tingling. The story is strong, and the performances and direction are too. I have never really liked Tom Cruise, but here he gives one of his better performances ever in this film, sometimes I forgot that it was him acting. Billy Connelly also handles his role well, though I usually associate him with comedy. However, it is indeed Ken Watanabe who captivates, and easily walks away with the acting honours. The script is well crafted, and while the Last Samurai is sometimes overly idealistic and a tad stereotypical, me and my brother cannot help deny this is a superbly shot and well performed film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2139664/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2005,mstomaso,10," Beautiful
","After my third viewing, I can finally admit that this film has me. I enjoyed it during its theatrical run, enjoyed it more the second time around, and now, I can only say that I love it. The cast is exemplary. Tom Cruise is so good in this film that it is very often easy to forget he is Tom Cruise. Easily his most powerful role and best performance since Jerry Maguire. Ken Watanabe, however, is incredible in every scene - acting with a rare sensitivity and intensity and breathing life into a character much larger and more human than the grand story of which he is a part. Though the entire cast is excellent, I feel that I must also single out Koyuki and Shichinosuke Nakamura for, respectively, the female lead and the emperor, for the subtle strength and believability they each give their very challenging roles.",/review/rw2139664/?ref_=tt_urv

","In a bid to try to improve trade links between Japan and the US Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is hired to train an army to overthrow a rebellious group of samurai led by their leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). However, the army that Algren had been training encounter the Samurai before their training has been completed and the army end up being overpowered and defeated by the highly trained Samurai. Algren is the only survivor of this battle and in recognition of his bravery and determination Katsumoto spares his life and invites him to stay with the Samurai.

","The Last Samurai is a brilliantly crafted aesthetic pleasure, studded with supernal performances from Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise. In fact, Tom Cruise unarguably gives his best ever performance, surpassing his portrayal of Jerry Maguire in the eponymous flick. His plaintive portrayal of Nathan Algren, not only evokes pathos but also seeks sympathy of the contemporary viewer, who can vicariously relate to Algren's disconcertion, owing to his inner conflicts of patriotism vis-à-vis humanity.",/review/rw2139664/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2004,Special-K88,," gripping and visually stunning
","Powerful, well-crafted epic set in 19th century Japan about a disillusioned American soldier who's hired to train a group of fledgling soldiers and lead them into battle against a rebellious samurai. Having been defeated and held captive by the enemy, he gradually begins to understand and develop a great respect for the man who should be his adversary. Long, but faultlessly performed and richly detailed with compelling battle scenes and vivid, breathtaking scenery. Cruise—sporting authentic Japanese tongue—is outstanding, but Watanabe steals the film in a moving and forceful performance as the fierce but honorable samurai warrior. Only letdown is the finale, which seems a bit too conventional, but it's still a remarkable tale of life, honor, and courage. ***½",/review/rw2139664/?ref_=tt_urv

30 July 2004,TxMike,," Excellent Samurai movie that never seems long.
","Students of film invariably turn to the older 'Seven Samurai' as one of the better movies of all time, but to me this movie, 'The Last Samurai' is much better for viewing by most of us modern movie-goers. That is not to say that 'technically' it is a better movie, because that doesn't matter for most of us. What matters is whether we can become emotionally immersed in the story, and this one allows that. While there are a number of good actors, only two carry the story -- Ken Watanabe, superb as Katsumoto, the leader in a remote village of last remaining Samurai in 1876 Japan, and Tom Cruise, equally superb as Nathan Algren, a battle-scarred  American soldier who is in Japan, along with others, to help them come into the modern world, and part of that is to develop an effective force of soldiers.

And Warner Bros put me through TORTURE to see this pic - changes of times AND locations, over and over.

","""The Last Samurai"" 2003 and ""The Last of the Dogmen"" (1995 d: Tab Murphy, with Tom Berenger and Barbara Hershey in the lead) are both films with the theme of the 'last' of warrior spirits (one is Samurai, one is Cheyenne). The production of The Last Samurai is well worth seeing - the glory of a large-scale Hollywood production it is. From the research of the historical Japanese Meiji period, the mannerisms, the way different classes of people dress, the settings, the battle weapons and armory, how the Samurai train and fight, to the study and appreciation of the Art of War - where men of honor and integrity in service to the Emperor is the thing to die for. The film title in three Kanji characters means The Way of the Warrior (Samurai). The one character shown on screen at the very beginning (romanization: Sze) meant in the service of the King. Hence the definition of Watanabe's Samurai lifelong one true goal - to serve his Emperor, one and only, and to die in the service of the Emperor would be an honor.",/review/rw2139664/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2007,arahman,8," A classic
","Tom Cruise's career no longer focuses on mind less action movies where the plot revolves around his cheesy grin. Whilst these movies have a place in film action history and have catapulted Cruise to the upper echelons of the Hollywood 'A' list it is safe to say that he now undertakes more complex and varied roles and is also more involved in the production of his films. Hence, one does not know what to expect from him in a historical action epic like the Last Samurai, Cruise can no longer be typecast. The Last Samurai documents the last days of the Samurai in the late 19th century and the simultaneous embracing of Western modernity by Japan. The Samurai are warriors sworn to serve their emperor to the death and whose lives are governed by a strict code of discipline, honour and dedication to their role in society. When Japan develops an arms and trade agreement with the USA the Samurai are the only ones who stand between modernism and the ancient way of life. Nathan Algren (Cruise), a tormented war hero is chosen to lead Japanese forces into battle against the Samurai but once taken prisoner embraces their way of life. The Last Samurai is a visually magnificent movie with fluid battle choreography, stunning landscapes and a detailed recreation of 19th century Japanese architecture and locations. The acting is excellent across the board with Cruise and Wantanbe (Katsumoto) delivering particularly memorable and moving performances. The action sequences are captivating, the dialogue engrossing, the story emotive and the love story whilst understated is so well executed that the movie could be billed as part of the Romance genre. Koyuki (Taka) delivers a brilliant performance as the widow who gradually changes from despising Cruise to caring for him. Whilst she has limited dialogue in the movie her expressions speak a thousand words. Special mention must also be given to Hans Zimmer's score which could actually be the most powerful score that I have ever heard in a film. High octane tracks such as 'Red Warrior' successfully get the heart racing during the film's action sequences whilst more emotive tracks such as ' A small Measure of Peace' seem to be penetrate through to the listeners soul and fit the atmosphere of the movie beautifully. Zimmer has truly out done himself this time and I fear that he will be unable to surpass this achievement. Excellent direction, strong acting performances, visual splendour, engrossing action, emotional depth and a truly beautiful soundtrack combine to deliver a deeply enjoyable and memorable movie experience. Seldom is a movie able to deliver on so many levels and in doing so The Last Samurai should be categorised as a classic in the movie history hall of fame.",/review/rw2139664/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2019,sparsh-hardik,10," Enjoyable and thoughtful
","There is an argument, that the ways generally Samurais are portrayed in the pop-culture is not truly accurate and many of them were corrupt. They resisted the modernization of Japan in 19th century under the Emperor Meiji, because it was going to take away their privileges as a warrior class. But Meiji's step (somewhat reluctant) was a visionary one and he brought the modern ideas into his country and started the industrialization, so that the Europeans couldn't get opportunity to fully dominate the land of a rising Sun. And till now, it is appreciated how Japan formed a perfect balance between the modern state and a state which values it's cultural identity. That's where India failed, due to lack of centralization of political power in 19th century.",/review/rw2139664/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was feeling a little disheartened about the state of the box-office in 2004; after watching RETURN OF THE KING, I knew nothing could better that movie and there was nothing really interesting on the horizon, either. Now, after watching THE LAST SAMURAI and noting the series of historical epics on the way, I'm starting to feel much, much better. THE LAST SAMURAI is a great movie, a breathtaking epic that equals Jackson's masterpiece in places, and certainly the frequent action scenes are shot in a much more violent, realistic and easier to follow way than in that fellow classic. THE LAST SAMURAI is a brilliant example of what Hollywood can do when it gets things right, recalling countless other epics such as BRAVEHEARt.",/review/rw2139664/?ref_=tt_urv

","The story for this film is set just after our Civil War. At the time, Japan had just overthrown the Shogunate and gone back to Imperial rule in a process known as the Meiji Restoration. The Emperor, Meiji, had a vision to bring Japan into modern times; to achieve this he began hiring experts from the world over to give Japan heavy industries, modern architecture, and a current, up-to-date Army. This movie chronicles the fictional events surrounding an American Army Captain, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), and what happens to him on the ancient isles; also what happens to the Samurai as they are rendered classless, and pointless, in the new Meiji Era.
