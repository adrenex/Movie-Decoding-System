29 November 2020,teocrito,8," Oh dude, you gotta see this
","It is hard to explain what this is about. It starts weird and ends even more weird... But I need to know what is going to happen...
As always Alex de la Iglesia does a great job to surprise the audience and in this case you end up saying ""what the heck just happened?""
If you like weird and extremely original series this one is for you.
I really like the actors by the way, for the Spanish audience they are pretty recognizable.",/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2021,MiguelAReina,7," Good and evil even in the script
","Great production effort for a series that contains the best and worst of √Ålex de la Iglesia, but in an ambitious format. It is excessive and sometimes clumsy in its development, it leaves characters without course like Elena, but it has great moments of terrifying fantasy with touches of typical Spanish humor. It is better when it pays homage to the Italian giallo (excellent Episode 7) than when it emulates ""The Da Vinci Code"", but as a whole it offers spectacle and entertainment.",/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2021,artistwriter-54705,10," Finally someone takes the supernatural seriously. THIS IS WORTH WATCHING.
",There will be no spoilers. This is my review of the first three episodes.,/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2021,bbevis-47954,8," Well
",Love the setting and the three main characters. The performances from the three main characters are excellent especially Megan Montaner's as Elena. The plot kept my interest and the setting was unique. I am not one of the people that are bothered by subtitles and I enjoyed the unique-strange atmosphere 30 coins provides. It won't be for everyone but I hope to see more.,/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2021,vader1948,9," Wow
",At first I thought I would not enjoy using sub titles. But this show is incredible. Haven't seen all of it yet but so far it's a great thriller/horror genre production. This is one you cannot figure out until it happens. Not for the squimish nor the pious. It thrills solid each episode. A must to stream but kit alone on a dark night. üòÇüëçüèª,/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2021,paul-allaer,7," Wild opening episode offers plenty of intrigue
","""30 Coins"" (2020 release from Spain; 8 episodes) brings the story of Father Manuel Vergara. As Episode 1 opens, we are in ""Geneva, Switzerland"", as a guy walks into a bank, shoots everyone in sight and manages to retrieve a coin from the bank's vaults. We then go to ""Pedraza, Spain"", a remote village where we are watching as a cow is giving birth. Inexplicably and shockingly, the cow births not a calf, but a baby boy, to the utter consternation of the small group there. They hastily call the village mayor, who in turn decides to call on the local priest, Father Vergara... At this point we are less than 15 min. Into the opening episode.",/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2021,ghost-mutation,9," Unexpectedly good!
","First, I'd like just to say that it speaks volumes about the credibility of most reviews on the internet that people are actually complaining about not understanding Spanish. There's always an agenda huh? Some of the best shows in the world right now are coming from other countries, while most American shows have started to become stale. Dark on Netflix is a perfect example of this, and it is the best show on the service. That's why the subtitles are there for you non-Spanish speakers. How do you in good faith leave a bad review because other languages in the world exist besides English? You people don't realize that you're only embarrassing yourselves? Why do this? You look moronic and the joke's on you.",/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2020,pablo_moriano,8," Long awaited. Deserved HBO's money
",First scene disappoints me a lot. Afterwards interest increases and makes it worth the watch. Good staff of actors and the world Alex de la Iglesia has previously shown is entirely on display here. Even there's some resemblance or homage to other films he shot in the past.,/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2020,virginiacottrell,9," Excellent show and binge worthy
","This series is from Spain and I don't mind subtitles every now and again, luckily I managed to watch a dubbed version which wasn't too bad compared with the subtitles that I left on just to check.",/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2021,saucy_design,9," The intro alone had me hooked......
","Watching the show mainly because this intro was so spectacular and shattering. My blood ran cold and I was almost traumatized by it. OK, that was being dramatic, but anyone who sees this intro will know what I am talking about. Sheer excellence. Father Badass is awesome. Insect people not so much but the actual show is funny and also diabolical.",/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2020,surfisfun,8," very good first episode!!! and decent next 3.
","Update: watched 4 episodes, its awesome compare to other fantasy / sci fie/ whatever in 2020, in my book.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Looking to be the best series of 2020.

religious demonic overtones wt strange priest.
it is not perfect wt some plot holes but so what.
absolute watch in Spanish wt subs.
finally, something worth it.
the theme song and intro is amazing, intense.
Actors are very good.",/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2021,akira-hideyo,6," Why?
",First half of series 1 had good potential. The last 3 nonsensical episodes= Bad.. Truly! My 30 coins worth.,/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2021,feistywench,9," I'm hooked
","These characters will bring you into their world and I dare you to try and leave. This show is everything you could want from the horror genre and more. Original and edgy, certainly worth your time. The cast is amazing and the setting is gorgeous",/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2021,Meesh85,10," Amazing Spanish thriller!
",Wow! This horror thriller from Spain captured and held my attention through all 8 episodes. Great storytelling with amazing actors. I personally am used to watching shows from other countries so subtitles don't bother me at all. I recommend not dubbing and using subtitles. And I think it's silly those that are rating a show lower due to their personal inability to understand another language or read subtitles. I'm not sure how that's the show's fault? Anyways great show! Can't wait for season 2.,/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2020,Universaliva,8," Espana cinema es no boring at all LOL
",I glued to this series the first time i saw the opening scene. It reminds me of POTC. I've always liked religious horror theme flicks and this series is no exception. By saying that I think regular horror fans can easily enjoyed it as well. Hope for more surprises in the upcoming episodes,/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2021,robhall_ie,5," Had great potential but...
","... It couldn't hold back the desire to throw everything from the drawing board into the series. Odd things just happen, the plot goes smooth then takes a jump and it doesn't feel orchestrated. Tons of plot holes and characters not doing obvious thing. However it's still fast paced enough to warrant a look if you like this genre. Damn all else on anyway....",/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2020,arimollar,8," Really intense
",Another intense horror intrigue suspense movie from Alex de la Iglesia. It reminds me of El d√≠a de la Bestia. Really good. Waiting to see what happens next!!,/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2021,j2k_,4," High Pace, Low Brow
","Disappointed with this one, it had the potential to be a dark and brooding masterpiece, with a solid premise. One episode in, and it feels the studio went for a far more actiony, low-brow approach, perhaps intended for a young audience, or just dumbed-down for mass market appeal.",/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2021,aratron-00391,10," So far excellent
",Great blending of supernatural horror and religious themes. Very intense and suspenseful. looking forward to more.,/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2021,tvdefrancesco,9," Me Gusta Mucho
",First off I'm officially in love with Megan Montaner (Elena). She is absolutely gorgeous. I prefer when watching a foreign show for it to be subtitled rather than dubbed like a lot of the Netflix shows do. When it's dubbed it's hard to tell how good the acting is versus whether or not I like the voice actor who's dubbed over. I thought the acting in this show was very good especially with how ridiculous the show is.,/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2021,qui_j,4," Starts off strong but fades after E4
","This had a fairly good start but began to go rapidly downhill after the fourth episode. The acting is poor and as with most Spanish series it is plagued by poor audio. Castilian Spanish delivered in a breathless manner of speaking, results in an almost incomprehensible garble of words. There is a lack of continuity to the story starting at episode 5 with little attention paid to sequencing events or offering any explanation for how events unfold. The story line becomes chaotic and very confusing. After that episode the plot falls apart and the script becomes totally ludicrous and unbelievable. Don't think there'll be much audience interest in a second season!",/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2021,nalindra-ferdinando,9," What a gem of a show!!!
",If you are looking for a great horror show this is it. This blends horror and catholic history to amazing combination that you will be glued to the screen. Yes you need to read subtitles but this is worth it and a must to watch.,/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2020,danimunoz,10," You gotta see it!
","It is the most weird series of all, nevertheless I loved it! Tension, weirdness and scary in one episode only.",/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2020,mnzero,10," Great story
","People who say this is horrible or predictable are wrong, it got an amazing story, can't wait for more episodes to come out.",/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2021,gaily_daily,7," Contrived but interesting
",Plot holes abound but damn if the storyline isn't compelling. Just ignore how contrived it can be and you'll have a good time.,/review/rw6510243/?ref_=tt_urv
