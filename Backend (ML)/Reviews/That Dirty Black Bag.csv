22 March 2010,Red-Barracuda,3," Treading water in Wonderland
","Sometimes I think that I should like Tim Burton movies more than I do. Don't get me wrong, the man has made some excellent films, such as the masterful Ed Wood. But all too often, despite an agreeable tendency towards visual flamboyance, I leave his films feeling somewhat underwhelmed. Alice in Wonderland is a case in point. It's a movie where CGI effects rule the day. But the trouble is that the true weirdness that is at the heart of this story is not captured at all with all the computer-generated imagery on-screen. Sure it's very efficient and well-designed but like CGI in general, it's far too polished to really strike a chord and convince. There is a distinct lack of wonder in this Wonderland. The otherworldly weirdness is dissipated too by the use of overly-familiar voices to give life to the various denizens of this world, we are left thinking 'Oh that's Stephen Fry, hey isn't that Alan Rickman, I'm sure that's Christopher Lee and isn't that the bloke from Little Britain, etc'. It consistently takes us out of the movie and grounds the characters in a way that is just counter-productive. We want weirdness from an Alice in Wonderland film, not slick CGI and famous voice-over actors.",/review/rw2217121/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2012,The-Sarkologist,10," A masterful reworking of a classic
","To me it is very hard not to give this movie a 10 (I don't like giving away too many 10s) because I find it very difficult to find anything I don't like about the movie. To me it is a masterpiece. The characters are very well defined, the actors play their roles very well, and the movie moves at a very good pace, leaving time to breath, but also keeping you enthralled. Tim Burton is a masterful film-maker, and his films do tend to be of the highest quality (ignoring Batman of course). In this film he revisits the story of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (as well as Jaberwocky and Through the Looking Glass) and though it may reflect events in these previous stories, it is not the book that Lewis Carrol originally wrote.",/review/rw2217121/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2010,DICK STEEL,9," A Nutshell Review: Alice in Wonderland
","I nearly laughed out loud at the family of three seated beside me, as the dad loudly remarked that they are probably the only persons in the hall who have read Lewis Carroll's books Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and the follow up Through the Looking Glass. It's one thing to try and brag to all around that they are well read and learned, and it's another actually to know that it's probably not Tim Burton's style to adapt a classic to the T, given various adaptations from print to screen thus far. The characters are clearly from both books with events vaguely resembling what was read before, but this film is a totally different ballgame altogether.",/review/rw2217121/?ref_=tt_urv

","Having never read the book/s, and only having vague memories of the old Disney cartoon version of Alice in Wonderland, all I knew going into this film was the gist of the story. However different things may be this time around, though, it remains an interesting tale. Alice isn't as young as the first time she visited Wonderland (she's 19 now) and has forgotten her previous journey, but it seems she goes about doing things exactly the same way as she did her first time around (like drinking/eating stuff that says 'Drink Me'/'Eat Me'. Considering just how ominous that sounds, WHY would you do that??). Her various ""wardrobe malfunctions""/costume changes, as a result of her shrinking/growing, are fun to watch.",/review/rw2217121/?ref_=tt_urv

","Alice Kingsley (Mia Wasikowska) is, unbeknownst to her, on her way to her engagement party. Turns out this is the famous Alice who 13 years earlier ventured in to Wonderland. Surely there is a creative reason to pull her back into the zany world. Nope, she merely felt the urge to chase a rabbit who himself was seeking to fulfill a prophecy.

6 March 2010,d_art,8," Movie Review: 'Alice in Wonderland' is a beautiful world to behold
","Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland is a sequel and not a retelling of the original children's novels by Lewis Carroll. In this film, Alice is now 19-years old, and soon after the death of her father, is proposed to be married away. Feeling pressured, she runs off, following a white rabbit, which leads her to Wonderland, a place she only vaguely remembers from childhood. There, she meets past familiar faces as the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the Blue Caterpillar (Alan Rickman), the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry), and eventually the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), who has been terrorizing the land with her harsh rule and beheading of heads. Alice finds out that her destiny is to end the Red Queen's rule by slaying the queen's dragon, Jabberwocky, as written in the prophesy. Along the way she meets up with all sorts of colorful characters.",/review/rw2217121/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am shocked by both this movie and my visceral reaction to it. Unlike Avatar, which used the 3D technology as an integral part of the movie, 3D adds nothing to this movie. And frankly, the glasses darken the screen so much that the already dimmed image (thanks to projectors that aren't as bright as they used to be) was pretty bland. ",/review/rw2217121/?ref_=tt_urv

24 March 2010,majikstl,," 'Twasn't brillig!
","If ever there were a working example of the word ""whimsical,"" it would be the works of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll), i.e.: ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking Glass."" The stories, stuffed with clever word play, non-sequiturs, train-of-thought chaos and general silliness, are not exactly funny, so much as just being playfully amusing. The reader – like Alice – takes a trip of wayward, unpredictable imagination. Tim Burton's film version (or re-imaging) of Carroll's tales likely will never be accused of being whimsical. Indeed, one would be hard pressed to find a trace of whimsy in any line of dialog or overwrought image. Burton's film, while certainly being visually stunning, is also dark, and at times just plain depressing.",/review/rw2217121/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2010,SeriousMovieCritic,1," Tacky Bombast - Silly Script - Waste of Talent
","Here is a tale of two Lewises. One wrote a small but great children's book that still delights, surprises and enchants. The other wrote a large, artistic series of children's books that push Christian sermons at us in the guise of adventure fantasy. The first author, Lewis Carroll, wrote Alice in Wonderland. The second, CS Lewis, wrote the Narnia saga. Here is what happened – in my theory – when the light bulb went on above the head of Linda Woolverton, who wrote the original screenplay for the new Alice in Wonderland.",/review/rw2217121/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2010,Sniper005533,6," Nothing Wonderful
","Adding a little bit of a background story and a few more characters to Alice's adventures didn't do as much as i thought it would for the story. Truthfully i wanted to love this movie, I'm a huge Tim Burton/ Johnny Depp fan. But this just didn't do it for me. I came out of the theater wondering if it were just the mediocre script or the director who had failed to meet my expectations. The best part of this movie is probably Johnny Depps portrayal of the mad hatter who truly is mad. However, Mia Wasikowska presents Alice in a dull manner that had me checking my watch every ten or fifteen minutes. Overall this film isn't awful, but at the same time its no masterpiece, for an interesting film to look at I suppose this would be an alright choice, however if you want a great story and compelling acting, you might want to check out something else, because this isn't the movie you're looking for.",/review/rw2217121/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2010,visforhendrix23,4," Alice in Blunderland
","I was able to catch a prescreening of Alice in Wonderland tonight on March 2nd. Despite some pretty nifty visuals, and jaw dropping set pieces, I found the movie to be incredibly dull, flat, and utterly full of itself. The film is merely a vehicle for Johnny Depp to showcase his talents, and he portrays the Mad Hatter as an actor who can't quite find the right shoes to fill in the role. He rotates from a Scottish brogue, to a feminine lisp, and staggers once in awhile as the unmistakable character of Captain Jack Sparrow. Where the visuals triumph, the story lacks. The proposed 'sequel' to Alice in Wonderland is literally a rehash of most of the finer points of the original, except a lot more Johnny Depp- a character who the audience is supposed to sympathize with and root for, but who i found a bit annoying and tiresome after awhile. The plot is fairly simple. Alice (the stone faced, newcomer Mia Wasisoska whose acting is limited to mildly concerned, mildly puzzled, and mildly agitated) flees from an arranged marriage proposal from a wealthy lord. She follows a curious white rabbit and tumbles down a hole into Underland, referred to as Wonderland by Alice. She then meets a variety of odd characters, most of them familiar from the original Alice. The plot is fairly simplistic, and a tad boneheaded. The Red Queen (Bonham Carter, slightly overdoing it, but arguably the best actor of the bunch) rules the land, but is pitted against the tiresome goodness and light of her sister, The White Queen (Hathaway doing an air-headed imitation of, you guessed it, Captain Jack Sparrow). Alice is destined by some ancient scroll to defeat the Jabberwocky and end The Red Queen's reign of terror. Alice boils down to mere eye candy-something that is visually pleasing, but is only a piece of fluff. If your a fan of Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, this movie is right up your ally. I prefer Burton at his best with movies that attempt to involve the audience like Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, and Big Fish. However, this bloated mess is sure to rank in hundreds of millions of dollars, but it tugs at our wallets rather than our hearts. It's a scary thought, but I hope that Burton's best work isn't behind him. 4/10",/review/rw2217121/?ref_=tt_urv

","It is still worth the high price of the 3-D admission to see some of the amazing animation and design, but the writing is extremely boring and clumsy, and the performances cannot save it. Too many liberties were taken with the originals here, and in no way improve upon them, it only barely resembles either of Carroll's books in theme and some specific scenes.

5 March 2010,Jackpollins,2," What happened Tim Burton?
","So far this year has been the year of directors who are going downhill. From Kevin Smith's Cop Out last week, the good directors making bad movies continues with Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland. Based on the book by Lewis Carroll, the film is too long, too boring, and too bland. From the little known short film Frankenweenie to Beetlejuice to Edward Scissorhands, Burton has shown us what an amazing talent he is. Unfortunately, his adaptation of Alice In Wonderland is just plain bad. Burton is such a good director, it's disappointing that his direction is so bleak. For the first 30-45 minutes, the film is visually stunning, if not still a bad film. The film actually starts out as a really great period piece, but that doesn't last for more than 10 minutes. Then the film goes into a fantasy that is nowhere close to fantastic. It feels like it's just piling anything that could use special effects. Johnny Depp is a great actor, and he's good here but this feels like his same character named Edward Scissorhands, and it feels like Depp should of had his character in that movie. Helena Bonham Carter is the only good thing in the film. She is fantastic as the evil Red Queen. Anne Hathaway is gorgeous, as always, and although she is a great actress she brings nothing to the table as the nice White Queen. The Red Queen-White Queen plot plays out like a really bad version of The Wizard Of Oz. Mia Wasikowska is alright as Alice, but isn't really anything great. An unrecognizable Crispin Glover is alright as the evil Stayne, Boyfriend of The Red Queen. Overall, the film is terrible, and you should do nothing but avoid it.",/review/rw2217121/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2010,WithoutPorpoise,2," Alice against Lewis Carroll
","I loved ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and remember it as an amazing and timeless adventure indeed. Alice wanders around in a world so enigmatic and unstable that you never know what will happen next, and what twist will put Alice in just new trouble, often unintentionally and tragically made worse by her own doing. Now this is all exactly what this movie does not have. After Alice arrives in the new 'underland', you will soon be in on the entire story: It is two sides, good against evil, and Alice is to slay a monster. Not a single second is unexpected. Nor are there any twists. (But even the first minutes are astonishingly wanting any concept: Scenes without any real characters rush by, there is no focus of attention in the opening.) But most of all, my understanding of then brand ""Alice"" is that she originally wanders around a dream land that confronts her with her own self, her anxieties, her shadowy anticipation that things will not be all nice and easy, all taking shape in landscapes, characters and events painted in dream-language. Of this essence, it should be no problem to create a movie that really leaves an impression - let alone, if Tim Burton is in the team. But there is nothing, nothing of this concept in this movie. Instead of joining a charismatic and mature character on the journey through her own dismal, natural instabilities that every one carries inside, the story here is already written, and Alice is only to follow marked footprints. For the only reason that... she is the one foretold to do it. There is merely the most silly 'hollywood-intellectualism', where 'good against evil' must be taken as, like, certainly some sort of metaphor representing all our everyday struggles, and it is so much about decision making and all... I'm devastated. Eventually, Tim Burton has added his potential for design to a movie completely without content. The only metaphor I see is Lewis Carroll appearing at the end in the figure of the Jabberwokie, and Alice, slaying him. Carroll is dead, long live 'Alice does Hollywood'.",/review/rw2217121/?ref_=tt_urv
