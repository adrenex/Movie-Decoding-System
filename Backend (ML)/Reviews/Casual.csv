20 August 2019,eddie_baggins,5," An odd western experience
","The type of Western that you could see the Coen Brothers putting their name behind, Damsel is further proof that there's life in the age-old genre yet as filmmaking duo David and Nathan Zellner take us on a darkly comedic trip to the wild west.",/review/rw8700051/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2018,Alexander_Blanchett,6," All right western comedy
","It was all right but nothing to write home about. Surprisingly funny at times tho. Robert Pattinson gives a solid enough performance, I did not expect that he can do comedy but in that film he did it better than the dramatic scenes that he dramatically overacted. The concept itself was good on paper but the Zellner bros failed with the execution at times. David Zellner gives a very solid performance in the film, possibly the best of the film. Mia Wasikowska was also fine but there were scenes she overacted as well. The soundtrack was pretty good and I liked the general look of the film, not only the cinematography but also the production design was good, although the film apparently had a limited budget. Its still nothing I would desire to watch again any time soon as it did not do anything inspiring (except maybe the narrative, which was at times a bit unexpected) . It had also some cute moments.",/review/rw8700051/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2019,Mr. Bug,," Disappointing
","As satisfying the first half till the ""Psycho event"" mostly is as unsatisfying is the second half, which is also unnecessarily cruel. Subversive recreation of the Western? Why not, but the rules of good drama/comedy still apply. Losing your audience by making everyone unappealing and/or needlessly abused does not work. And adding slapstick elements does not fix the problem.",/review/rw8700051/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2018,larrys3,4," Difficult Watch
","With very deliberate pacing and dark humor that seldom works effectively, this movie just added up to a difficult watch for me. Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska are fine actors but they can only do so much with this flat script. Save yourself the trek.",/review/rw8700051/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2018,buyamonkey,8," A tragic farce.
","There are very few farces made these days, so people aren't very used to the exaggerated and non-realistic elements of this genre. It's the same reason some of the Coen Brother movies don't connect with mainstream audiences. This time it's the Zellner Brothers, and they double down on the unusual genre elements by making it a farcical western. But if you're down for some off-beat cinema, what the Zellner's do here is pretty fantastic.",/review/rw8700051/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2020,Gordon-11,," Dull
","This western is different because of its low body count, but that is more due to the low number of characters in the wilderness. The pace is slow, and the characters are not so sympathetic. I found it rather dull and boring.",/review/rw8700051/?ref_=tt_urv

9 May 2019,Moviereeeels12,1," Why Bother With This Movie?
","... there is no good reason to spend time with this movie, yes great scenery, great acting, the two leads are great, but the story is slow, boring and empty. I felt that a group of friend made a movie for themselves and all i was there for is to give them my money and get nothing in return!",/review/rw8700051/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2019,clarkmick33,4," Pretentious Western... trying to be edgy
","This film should have been a short film and it may have been good... but it felt drawn out to its full film length .... at first the dialogue was interesting and whimsical but then became pretentious and obvious .... there were parts when the actors seemed in character with a western accent and ye olde vocabulary and there were others where they seemed to make no effort at all just throwing out modern slang and slander like dropping f bombs... it just threw you out of the movie. The twist I could see a mile off..... however all the actors felt like they just came ""on set"" clothing looking fresh. Some of the dialogue between the characters goes no where.... which is you feel at the end of the film .... just gone none where.",/review/rw8700051/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2018,brillig-2,1," Failed comedic farse
","I went into the theater having not even watched a trailer, so I didn't know what to expect. One of the first scenes showed two men waiting for stage coaches going in opposite directions in a landscape that was hot, dry, and windless (although there was wind whistling in the background). Perhaps that wind noise should have been a hint to me that the movie was supposed to be a farce.",/review/rw8700051/?ref_=tt_urv

12 September 2018,twelve-house-books,7," Comedic (North)Western
","Much funnier than I imagined it would be. All actors play amazing, well-rounded characters. There is loads of cursing and quite a bit of blood, but overall this film is a cross between the outrageous humor of My Name Is Nobody and the dead seriousness of The Long Riders. This is not one of those ""Westerns"" where everything is re-imagined into a porno flick (taking us back to the 70s with The Great Scout and Cathouse Thursday) or an unbelievable bloodbath (Django Unchained). This is how the West really was--filled with mumbling, bumbling, stumbling real people--most of them nefarious--trying to conquer a vast space of land without community, love for nature or God, and the law of the heart.",/review/rw8700051/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2020,eberkerbatur,6," Absurd Western Comedy Strange but Beautiful (6.3)
","It was very slow and boring at first, especially I found the speech scenes at the beginning of the movie meaningless but I must say it has an interesting topic.
When I got a little bored at the beginning of the movie, it got more interesting and fluent as it progressed, it was aroused curiosity, the acting was also very good.
Generally speaking, a strange movie is already a western comedy but an absurd comedy movie.",/review/rw8700051/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2020,sharansrinivas-g,," Avoid At All Costs
","What was the point behind this movie? What was it trying to tell us? What made Pattinson and the girl from Alice in Wonderland and Jane Eyre want to star in it?
Questions add up in your mind almost every minute. That's the Damsel experience. It's an experience indeed, one that I wish I hadn't gone in search of.",/review/rw8700051/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2018,LifeVsArt,9," Method to the madness.
","This is not your grandfather's western. For those who have seen the Zellner's ""Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter"" you will recognize their unique sensibility but find even that won't prepare you for the monumental turnaround taken in this strange, absurdist, feminist comedy/drama. Avoid spoilers at all cost, just go in with whatever expectation you may have and allow the Zellners to take you on a wild ride that, along the way, has a lot of slapstick but also some very substantial ideas on the relationship between the sexes - reality vs illusion, etc. The acting is topnotch. Robert Pattinson acquits himself wonderfully in this farcical frontier - he has a real comedic sense that is tapped in his loony over-the-top Romantic character. Mia Wasikowska is a total powerhouse as Penelope, expressing so much with her face and body - she takes the movie by the throat and rides it off into the surreal sunset. Wasikowska is the beating heart of a movie that has both zany episodes and surprising pathos. The more distance I get from ""Damsel"" the more I think about it and the more I realize there is a definite method to the Zellner's madness. This is a bold film that takes great risks - we need more movies like this that don't settle for playing it safe.",/review/rw8700051/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2020,Evastar,5," Definitely different...
","...But different in a good way or a bad?? I even bought this movie (still can't believe I did!) on Apple TV, cause I thought it was a romantic movie in Wild West and since I love Pattinson and love Wasikowska, I was pretty sure it would be at least descent. But No. This whole story was a 2-hour-wtf movie. I was literally jaw-dropping and face-palming the whole time -but in a boring way -if possible!!?! But yes, this movie was impossible. Why why why and why did I waste my time and money for this?! And why oh why did these good actors make this movie? What's the meaning of the story? That damsels don't need saving?! Ffs. The only nice thing was the scenery.",/review/rw8700051/?ref_=tt_urv

27 October 2018,Gentzen,1," Pointless
","When all there is to a movie is an academic exercise in ""deconstructing"" the genre, without either a point to make, a story to tell, or formal innovation as a means to convey non-typical narratives via the western genre. When a spectator can see the attempt at wit and the tinkering with ""cliches"" coming up hours before they happen (and you can't even find that they make some sort of new sense). When the movie leaves even well-meant (and by no means unsophisticated) spectators bemused and pondering what the point was to it all. Then your movie will have the same fate that tons and tons of cultural studies papers are destined for, following a brief spell of mandatory plaudits by the cabal crowd: passing to oblivion without any effect. Distress, rather than Damsel, should have been the title here.",/review/rw8700051/?ref_=tt_urv

","Many may not know, but one of the very classical (meaning really old) themes in ""Westerns"" (and other period dramas I suppose, e.g. Middle Ages & earlier knights) is the stereotypical manly male off to rescue the fair lady (damsel).
