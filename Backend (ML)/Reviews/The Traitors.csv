9 April 2019,cherold,8," Season 1: Good. Season 2: Huh? Season 3: Excellent.
","Season 1 Review - 8 stars:
Funny and likable, yet dark, with perhaps a gnostic slant.",/review/rw4674914/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2019,houtxnikki,8," Trust me - God has a sense of humor
","To all of those upset by this show's humorous take on all things Heavenly - lighten up. Do you really think the Lord doesn't have a sense of humor? In the first place, He created man in His own image (Gen. 1:27) - meaning if we are capable of humor, so is He. If Moses' word isn't definitive enough for you, let me tell you a little story. I used to have a Great Pyrenees, a 150 lb sheepdog, who was allergic to 21 different substances (I had him tested). Twenty of the 21 things were environmental; mostly plant-based. Want to take a guess what that 1 other thing was? What's the absolutely, positively, very last thing on the face of this tired old planet to which a sheepdog could possibly be allergic? Yep. You guessed it...
Wool.
Never let anyone tell you that God doesn't have a sense of humor.",/review/rw4674914/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2019,Aesafern,5," Not bad but not great.
","When I heard Buscemi was playing God it definitely raised my expectations. Maybe my expectation were a bit too high. The humour is a little basic and juvenile. There were no laugh out loud moments, and the ideas were cliche. Watchable but will not be my ""go-to"" for something funny to watch.",/review/rw4674914/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2020,Lurker246813579,8," This is a good dark show, and silly, we need these
","First off, I created an account just for this review. I have a fb and twitter and i have never touched them, just to lock up my name, I'd rather be in the mountains than be on fb.
I like this show, season 1 was something unique, I think we're all looking for unique content these days. It was very Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxyish, the book, not the movie. You cannot successfully put multiple books into a movie, stop it. The character chemistry was great, I like that the show uses rated R language as well, it's not over the top, but realistic.
People seem to hate season 2, I liked it. A complete flip from heaven, to shovellin'. There aren't too many shows that address the medieval time period in history, and who would hae thought such a unique job was out there. The Fred Armison episode was great. The father son tension was good. The love interest tension was good. There's always a moral point or two to an episode.
I awaited each episode, it's a smart show. Big Bang is not a smart show, it debases intelligence. The only big network shows I watch is Brooklyn 99, and the Orville, when's that come back?. I liked the good place. Don't give me politics, give me a good story arc, smart dialogue, likeable/hateable characters. We need some of these shows in our lives to decompress. It's Always Sunny, why do we love it, because it's stupid, and we forget about things for 22 minutes without commercials.
I want more of the jumping around timelines, with this same cast, they are great together, even the king.
If American Horror Story can do it, why not a show like this? AMH, needs help though, maybe they need a dark ages season.",/review/rw4674914/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2019,DylanSMPhillips,7," The Passable Cousin of 'The Good Place'
","Miracle Workers is a quirky comedic concept that never finds itself fully formed. The story, themes and comedy never quite hit the absurdist levels they hope to push. Thankfully, the cast is extremely charismatic and fun surrounded by an entertaining premise and some thought-provoking themes. It ends up becoming a run-of-the-mill, ordinary comedy that is saved by the hilarious and layered performances of Buscemi and Radcliffe. From its fun inventive premise to its half-baked idea, Miracle Workers ends up being the passable distant cousin of The Good Place.",/review/rw4674914/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2020,niceguy-737-812940,8," SUCH a disconnect between Season 1 and Season 2!
","Looking at reviews on here, it looks like this premiered SOMEWHERE maybe a year ago, but around here it premiered only a few months ago, with maybe a week between seasons, so it's rather easy to compare. The title nicely fits the premise of season 1, Heaven is an office with departments, with Buscemi's God being the goofball CEO. Fun. And loved seeing Radcliffe in something else. We mainly follow two angels trying to pull off a miracle (where they're limited to techniques that don't automatically prove there's a heaven). I found it fun and funny, and as someone gleefully without religion, religious topics usually don't interest me, but that wasn't a problem here.",/review/rw4674914/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2019,brittni-71113,9," I don't want it to end
","I was on the fence about watching this but i always enjoy Steve Buscemi's work, My only dislike is i wish the episodes would be a little longer since it will be a short series i'm already dreading the last episode. The cast is great and the underlining dark humor is wonderful. I'm sure if God is really out there he might find this amusing.",/review/rw4674914/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2019,cheathamg,3," My hopes were dashed.
","I had high hopes for this series. I very much like The Good Place and thought this might yeild some of the same gold. But where The Good Place is clever, thoughtful and original, Miracles Workers is clumsy, obvious and sophomoric. Radcliffe tries too hard with very little result. Buscemi is too talented for this part. It's sad to watch him wading in a shallow pool searching for nonexistent nuggets.",/review/rw4674914/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2019,Max_Lucas,3," Not as good as it could be.
","Despite a good cast it has failed to deliver any laughs. Shallow characters and story. Stories are so short that they have to add commentaries to fill up a 30 min slot. There's another show out there that's actually GOOD, worth a ""7 rating"" PLACE.",/review/rw4674914/?ref_=tt_urv

21 August 2021,lanaliliya,8," Unique storyline
","Its so rare to find tv shows that are not only absolutely hilarious, but also have a unique storyline. This show is so unique and I binge watched it so fast. After finishing season 1, I was so excited to see what would happen in season 2. To my surprise its a totally different plot with the same characters. I'm quite disappointed, because there are so many mid-evil shows out there and it would've been awesome to see a continuation of the original unique plot.",/review/rw4674914/?ref_=tt_urv

11 March 2019,he88,2," Even This Old Heathen Finds It In Bad Taste
","From the trailer I really thought this looked pretty funny. I tried to like it, but it was just too silly all the way around. To have God as a immature deity who comes across as being insecure and maybe depressed....Well that's just too silly. I got through one and a half shows before I shut it down and dumped it.",/review/rw4674914/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2019,annaelizabeth-37981,10," (Not Religious), I love this show already!!
","This was super funny. I can see why some are scoring this low, due to the satire and dark humor that may seem a little sacrilegious.
If are realistic and you actually have a sense of humor, regardless of how cynical, you will love this show.",/review/rw4674914/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2019,nkishudak,10," Brilliant
","I absolutely love the simplicity of this show. Radcliff is a very talented actor, Steve Buscemi is amazing as usually and to be honest, I totally can imagine God this way after what we did on Earth. And I know...it is a little bit uncomfortable to see things through like a...comedy show, but you need good sense of humor to live in this world and probably He/She ( :D) is having a good time when watching this show. I, personally love it. :)",/review/rw4674914/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2019,eddieo1969,3," A generous 3
","Despite a good cast and a decent premise the series (after 3 episodes) has failed to deliver any laughs. I still don't know who I'm supposed to like and who I'm supposed to hate, the characters are all one dimensional.
The part at the end where the actors and the Creator have to explain what happened during the episode does my head in. You shouldn't have to explain the subtext to the audience after the show has ended.",/review/rw4674914/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2021,bjjao,9," It's just a quirk, weird little show with great writing and humor

14 July 2021,goldengirl911,7," Absolutely loved the first season; I'd rate it 10.... But 2nd?!?
",I just binged the first season and absolutely loved it. It was hilarious. I was so excited to see what season 2 had to offer until.... I watched the first couple episodes and realized it was a whole different story. The whole themed changed; and though dumb funny and a silly laugh.... It didn't hold up to the awesome concept of the first season. I curious how season 3 will be with the theme Oregon Trail. But I won't finish season 2.,/review/rw4674914/?ref_=tt_urv
