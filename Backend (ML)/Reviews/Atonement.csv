22 May 2017,paul_haakonsen,6," Every time someone farts, a demon gets his wings...
","I loved the comic book back in the day, and I was with it from the early beginning. So when there was news about a feature movie based on Spawn was in the works, it was naturally thrilling news. And furthermore, with New Line Cinema involved, it could be nothing but good. Right? Well, while ""Spawn"" certainly has its moments, it is not without its flaws. And believe you me, the flaws in this movie were monumental.",/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2017,BandSAboutMovies,5," Spawn's powers do not include aging well
","There was a time when comic books were not celebrated. When only the disenfranchised cared or knew about them instead of the mainstream. And in those ancient times — let's call them 1992 — no news was bigger than when Marvel's biggest creators left en masse to form Image Comics. At the time, these artists were derided as style over substance. Many of them weren't known for hitting their deadlines. Or even how to draw feet properly. But one of them — Todd McFarlane — took the opportunities that his new home presented and made the most of them, creating his signature character: Spawn.",/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2000,GuyCC,5," Just Like the Comic - For the Right and Wrong Reasons.
","This film is just like the comic that inspired it: Great visuals (I still really like McFarlane's superhero art style), but much like the majority of ""Spawn"" stories, it really doesn't go anywhere. The set looks good, the characters look good, the cape looks REALLY good, but the story? Other than telling the origin and the standard ""must stop the bad guy"" motive, it doesn't do as much as it should. And yes, I know it's a Hell-based movie, but the metal soundtrack just got distracting and annoying, instead of enhancing the story like it should have. John Williams or Danny Elfman it wasn't.",/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2005,BrandtSponseller,8," A flawed but enjoyable absurdist horror-comic book film
","Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) is one of the top operatives for Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen), who is the head of an organization called A6. When Simmons becomes aware that A6 might be a little shady, he learns the hard way that he isn't allowed to quit A6. This leads to his transformation into Spawn, a superhero with a background and motivations that are just as morally ambiguous as A6. The film largely concerns Spawn discovering and exploring his new identity, while working to uncover a nefarious plot and attain revenge.",/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2019,patriciogl10,6," Heavily flawed, still enjoyed it a bit.
","You can easily tell that comic book based movies were not a popular demand back in the '90s. Spawn is a result of a sloppy adaptation from a source material which is really difficult to rightfully adapt, special effects that were expensive and got dated after two years and a production company that didn't seem to have taken the making of this movie seriously. So logically it feels like a really poor effort, yet it has its moments.",/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2010,Samiam3,5," A few good scenes don't save this wreck of a story.
","There are moments in Spawn that stand out with exceptional creativity, but what truly stands out about the movie is just how much of a mess it is. ",/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2017,randyfromscream,6," It's alright it need more improvement
",So yeah I got done watching this movie and I found few problems. That damn clown in that movie is annoying thank god he got killed at the end. The make up is good but the CGI is bad like a PS1 cut scene. I wonder why this movie is the most forgotten like no one talk about it. The visual are good like it remind me of Hulk (2003) but without the comic style just a hellish type. Not the best movie but it's enjoyable.,/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,4," Disappointing, but with some redeeming qualities thank goodness
","After watching Spawn, I felt disappointed. Maybe my expectations were too high, as the comic is not easy to adapt at all, but this film could have been so much better than it was. But to no avail, there are actually some redeeming qualities, which I'd better start with before explaining what I found wrong with Spawn.",/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2018,Darth_Osmosis,8," Great for it's time
","This is just really cool, plus I saw it first at a rather young age. The effects really are sometimes terrible and other times good or even very good for it's time, still features many cool action scenes and set pieces, a memorable anti-hero and the unforgettable character of the ""Clown"".",/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2016,SnoopyStyle,4," too campy to be dark
",Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) is an agent of a covert government agency headed by Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen). He is angered by the civilian casualties of the latest hit. Wynn sends him on the next mission to attack a North Korean biochemical plant. Wynn double-crosses him with assassin Jessica Priest (Melinda Clarke). He is sent down to Hell where demon king Malebolgia offers him a deal. It's 5 years late. Al returns to earth to see his love Wanda Blake (Theresa Randle) who is now married to his best friend Terry Fitzgerald (D.B. Sweeney) and raising his daughter Cyan. Evil minion Clown/The Violator (John Leguizamo) reminds him of the deal to kill Wynn and lead the demon army upon Armageddon in exchange for Wanda. Cogliostro was also an assassin from Hell but he saved his soul and battle for Heaven.,/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2011,gigan-92,6," Enjoyable, Flawed, Fun= ???
","I remember seeing this film as a kid, and i remember it being pretty bad-ass. Joining IMDb, and seeing it at a 4.9, I was astonished. But having been over twelve years, I decided to go out and buy the Director's cut. Just to be blunt, it's nowhere near worthy of the rating it's at. But, there is quite a bit of wasted potentiality. I'll start off with the good, which really there is a lot of if you think about it. First off, if you're really into action, look no further because this film sports a nice amount of it. And the basic premise is pretty interesting, but even the director's cut clocks in at under an hour and forty minutes , so it fails to dive any deeper than it certainly could've. The cinematography is by Guillermo Navarro, who many of you probably know from his work with director Guillermo del Toro ( ""Blade 2"", the ""Hellboy"" series, ""Pan's Labyrinth"", etc.), and he does a bang up job. With the right direction this could have been a masterpiece by all means. Mark A.Z. Dippé knew and carried out the bare minimum of film making, and if you look into it is busy now-a-days with animated Garfield productions. What a down grade, huh? About 90% of the visuals are pretty damn good actually, and the acting as it is is all right. For these things alone, I enjoyed this movie, where as I despised ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" for its predictable generic storyline and overly done flashy effects. Michael Jai White was far from terrible and John Leguizamo was pretty terrific if not a bit cartoony at times.",/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2002,bsinc,6," Not very bad, but not very good
","This is a tough movie to vote. I personally liked it more than not, but only because I have always been fascinated with comic book super heroes, but that's it, Other than that, and some occasionally very well done special effects, this movie pretty much sucked. The parts where Hell or whatever that ridiculous place is supposed to be are done so poorly I won't even bother loosing words about it. The acting isn't as bad as some claim (well, what exactly can you expect from Martin Sheen anyway)and Theresa Randle is gorgeous as ever. The atmosphere of the movie is very, very dark and morbid, so I would recommend this movie to comic-hero fans ONLY!",/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2018,Bored_Dragon,6," I love the smell of burning asphalt in the morning
","To be honest, this movie is a crap, but it has its charms. Spawn has a good make-up and following effects, and the music is quite good. It could be a guilty pleasure if you have time to waste.",/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2007,CalvinValjean,1," Terrible Film, From a Comic That Is Perhaps Unadaptable
","I'm not sure if the Spawn comics really can be adapted to a film medium. To sum it up: you have a murdered CIA hit-man who makes a deal with a devil, comes back as deformed creature with strange powers, and has to deal with a psychotic demon in clown form. Umm, yeah. Maybe Sam Raimi or Guillermo Del Toro could'be made such a film, but alas, they didn't, and the result is an inept production.",/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2006,dee.reid,5," ""Spawn""-lite
","""Spawn"" is a special effects spectacle unlike anything before it. It has some dazzling CGI effects to complement its dark tone and breathe life into the Gothic fantasy, and wondrous cinematography to carry it out. Unfortunately, that's all it has to offer, which is a real shame, because this had the potential to be one hell (pun intended) of a movie.",/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2009,lee_eisenberg,5," I had never heard of Spawn until this came out
","I first learned of ""Spawn"" from a trailer that preceded another movie. I overheard a friend say that Spawn was the #1 selling comic character in America. This was a real surprise to me, as I had never heard of Spawn. So, eventually, I went to see the movie. Having recently seen the beyond-dreadful ""Batman and Robin"", I figured that this one couldn't be any worse. Once the movie was over, I decided that it had been entertaining enough for the time being - mainly due to the maggots and the ""Apocalypse Now"" references - but didn't really amount to anything otherwise. Of course, I've never been into comic books, so maybe I'm not the right person to decide. I only recommend it if you want brief entertainment.",/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv

7 November 2003,Tyler_R_Weston,10," The Master of Hell in the Movie of Horror...
","Spawn has become one of my favorite superheros of all-time. There's no words for this film. IT'S SUPERB!!! The fx are amazingly done and McFarlane should be proud of this film. Spawn is a new hero to our world, his appearances are only about 10 years old. But that doesn't matter. I believe that this movie demonstrates what Hell can really be like. Spawn is a super original hero that only a person like McFarlane create. If there are any remakes or sequels, this one will remain the best!! I'm disappointed with the rating though. Spawn has also made a great appearance in Soul Calibur 2. This movie has a great cast and the costumes are magnificent. Lequizamo is strangely humorous in this film and insane. The Violator was also superb. Bring on part 2! McFarlane has proved himself powerful by creating Spawn. I truly recommend it. Spawn is one of our top heroes of all time.",/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2018,yogirajj-95810,9," Honestly.......
","Honestly, I really don't understand why this movie has such a low rating. I theroughly enjoyed this movie. John Leguizamo was hilarious! In fact, I think Leguizamo and White and great acting chemistry. Lots of action, great special effects for it's time, and it had a perfect blend of dark comedy that not that many writers can pull off. Guys, lighten up, this has got to be my ultimate favorite Michael Jai White move.",/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2000,kenandraf,7," Too much effects!
",A great example of what happens when the producers get carried away with too much special effects!They could have done a better movie with better direction and less special effects.They should also have made it a tag more serious by toning down the clowning.They also took the dialogue of the comic books too literaly.Exagerrated dialogue  in comic books make up for lack of motion and is  not needed in movies.Basic stuff like these destroy most movies that could have been classics.The damage has made this movie a tag below average.,/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv

","The first time I saw this...well, I wanted to like it. I had rented it probably as soon as it came out on VHS. I hadn't read a Spawn comic but knew one thing, he was a badass and a lot of people liked the comics. I had high hopes. Boy, was I disappointed. Now as the time has passed and I've gotten older, I've tried to like it for different reasons. For the campy aspect of it, for Leguizamo's part, for anything...I still don't.",/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2002,Mr_Derp,," Sacrilege
","I saw this movie after I had seen the animated mini-series, and let me say I am sorry to have seen it all. I never really followed the comics, but after witnessing the genius of the animated version, I could never have imagined that it was possible to ruin such a good character and story so thoroughly and completely. It is flashy, campy, and ridiculous. The acting is terrible, and the effects are just terrible. The movie manages to create a completely inappropriate atmosphere and does nothing to reveal the depth and darkness of the title character. Dump this in the garbage and watch the mini-series.",/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2005,Movie Nuttball,10," Spawn is a great film! One of the best!
","Spawn is an awesome film that has a great cast including Michael Jai White, John Leguizamo, Martin Sheen, Theresa Randle, Nicol Williamson, D.B. Sweeney, Melinda Clarke, Miko Hughes, Sydni Beaudoin, Michael Papajohn, Frank Welker, and Todd McFarlane! The acting by all of these actors is very good. White is excellent in this film. He perfect for this role! Leguizamo was great and hilarious! Sheen performed good and is a great villain. Nicol Williamson has a great performance here! I love his voice! The thrills is really good and some of it is surprising. The movie is filmed very good and special effects are outstanding. The music is great by Graeme Revell. Great directing by Mark A.Z. Dippé! The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end. This is a very good and thrilling film. If you like Michael Jai White, John Leguizamo, Martin Sheen, Theresa Randle, Nicol Williamson, D.B. Sweeney, the rest of the cast in the film, Action, Thrillers, Horror, Fantasy, Comic, and interesting epic films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today!",/review/rw1073366/?ref_=tt_urv
