4 May 2011,Blueghost,," Kind of fun.
","I have to admit right now that I've never seen the TV series, so I don't know all the differences/improvements and whatever else that was done when the film was translated from the big screen to the small screen.",/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2015,drownsoda90,7," Sassy and spunky horror-comedy
","""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" follows sassy and unsuspecting cheerleader Buffy (Kristy Swanson), a simple L.A. girl who spends her free time shopping and socializing in the mall food court. But when she finds herself responsible with the taking down bloodsucking demons from hell under the eye of a newfound guardian (Donald Sutherland), her extracurricular activities take a serious hit.",/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2014,SnoopyStyle,6," Good campy fun if you don't take it seriously
","Buffy (Kristy Swanson) is the quintessential valley girl cheerleader. She and her friends are all clueless. She is approached by Merrick (Donald Sutherland) and told that she is the Slayer. There are vampires in the world, and there is a slayer who fights them. When one slayer falls, another one takes her place. It is Buffy's turn to be the Slayer. She is joined by a slacker outcast Pike (Luke Perry) in a fight against the powerful Lothos (Rutger Hauer).",/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2014,guisreis,8," Charming Buffy, many laughs: the movie delivers what it promises
","This is an unpretentious and funny high school action movie with vampires. Very beautiful young Kristy Swanson does a good job playing charismatic and initially futile Buffy. Even the most obvious clich√©s are nice to be seen performed by her: Silverstone-Clueless-style emptiness, martial arts and vampire-slaying practice, cheer-leading for the basketball school team. Both arrogance and tenderness are convincingly portrayed at her pretty face. Quite remarkable was also Donald Sutherland in the role of Buffy's tutor, Merrick. The film gets campy sometimes, but it is not a flaw. It is quite good in what it intends to do (and that is not to frighten or to be serious). Indeed, I laughed a lot! Seeing Hillary Swank in her very first movie playing one of Buffy's best airhead friends is something to be highlighted. The same can be said about having Rutger Hauer as the comic master vampire. My positive review has nothing to do with being a fan of the TV show, as I have never watched it.",/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2006,MrGrundle,6," Different films earn stars in Different ways....
","Buffy the vampire slayer is not a terrific film. It is not the type of cinema that leaves you breathless and reeling, nor is it the type of cinema that idles at first creeps through your dreams with pervasive intensity. No, this is Time Capsule Cinema, a voyage to the neon panoply of early 90's California in the self described ""Lite Age.""",/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2002,Aidan McGuinness,6," Tongue-in-cheek but it doesn't make a great movie
",First off I have to say my review of this movie may be somewhat coloured by my adoration of the television series. Despite sharing a few superficial elements - a character called Buffy who slays vampires and who has a watcher - the two are quite distinctive (even if Joss Whedon penned them both).,/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2008,princesss_buttercup3,8," You have to be seriously uptight not to find this hilarious.
","I can't believe other reviewers called this moving ""boring and idiotic"". Um...hello...what were they expecting, a serious, contemplative piece of cinema? It's completely silly, as it's supposed to be. If it wasn't good, would it have inspired a (far inferior, in my opinion) television spin off? Watch it with no expectations. You'll be impressed. Kirsty Swanson does that Alicia Silverstone in ""Clueless"" thing perfectly. My friends and I have made it a ritual to watch this movie every couple months with a bottle of wine and a big bowl of popcorn. Nothing better on a rainy night. Don't listen to the bozos who said this isn't worth seeing. It's hilarious, trust me.",/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2021,cullengirl456,10," My dad hates this movie...
",My dad hates this movie. I watched it so much as a child he literally gets angry when I bring it up. I love this movie. Everything about it. Will forever be my all time number one.,/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2004,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," And thus started the series
","Ah, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", my favorite TV show of all time. You know, it's weird how came across it. I've always loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Movie, and I just thought they were going to play the movie on TV, but when it was a TV show, I was shocked. But I was hooked.",/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2007,laviniacg,8," Not Oscar Material, but Very Smart
","This is one of my favorite movies. It's full of extremely clever one-liners that I never get tired of. ""Oh, yeah? Clap!"" The main character acts like a brainless bimbo but, if you pay attention, the movie gives you subtle hints she's a lot smarter than she lets on. Acting brainless is a little social camouflage so she fits in with her airhead friends.",/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2021,edblackham,9," It's a classic
","Anyone who rates this less than an 8 really needs to find a life. Is it the normal high brow Hollywood garbage? No, it's campy classic fun. Kristy Swanson was amazing as Buffy. Completely different from the TV series, but I preferred the movie. Paul Reubens was hilarious.",/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2020,reddiemurf81,6," Early 90s nostalgia
","This DOES NOT EVEN BEGIN to hold a candle to the TV show,, but for us 90s kids it's a fun time trip back.",/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2011,shido-san,8," Very well done - but you have to look at it through the right lens
","This was written, directed and acted as a teen-comic romp but I can't help thinking of Robin Williams complaint to a comedy club in, was it, Vancouver, BC? ""I did the same act before Mork and you hated me!"" Looking back, what did we have here? A stellar cast and crew! Joss Whedon writing, Donald Sutherland, Rutger Hauer, Paul Reubens (playing the dark side of Pee-Wee Herman), then teen-idol Luke Perry (doing an impressive James Dean, or does he always act that way), Hilary Swank, Thomas Jane, and some very special acting from David Arquette, and I believe it is Sasha Jensen, who played newbie vampires either euphorically, or invincibly ~ both being reasonable positions when you discover you now have unbelievable powers. Oh, and did you see Ben Affleck and Seth Green? They aren't credited but they're in there.",/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2010,AlsExGal,6," Campy movie shows the origins of Buffy
","I first saw this movie back in 1992 when it was first released, and I thought it was good campy fun, nothing more. When I began watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer the TV series, and saw Joss Whedon's true vision for the story, I realize he must have been furious at how the studio basically rewrote his script. If you are a Buffy fan and you have never seen the movie, it is worthwhile from a historical standpoint to see all of the contrasts.",/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv

25 April 2001,chloemonster,9," Snarky and funny...
",I loved this movie.  I'd seen it waaaaay before the series was a twinkle in anyone's eye.  This film is built for total entertainment and some of the dialog is the best around just because it is so ridiculous.,/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2002,Smala,8," That's fun. No, that's funny.
",This is a terribly fun movie. The acting is deliberately over the top and does quite well. Everyone from Swanson to Perry to Reubens to Stephen Root does an excellent job. I don't understand people who didn't like this - it's simply fun.,/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2020,quisha-01195,10," A funny movie

2 November 2002,FrozenDreamer,," A fun one...

5 February 2001,medea_argos,10," Funny & different
","I am a big fan of all movies that portray ditzy blonds as the heroes, showing the world just how much we can do! I really enjoyed Buffy, especially since I am not a big horror fan and this movie lightened the scare with humor! I think that Kristy Swanson is a great heroine for bumbling blonds! She is a modern day Jean Arthur!",/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2003,spiritwriter,8," underrated -- more than fluff
","underrated action/comedy:  witty, intelligent, nuanced humor in the writing and acting.  Lest people forget, this was an early entry in the no-longer-waiting-for-her-prince, newly-empowered, women-who-can-kick-butt genre ....full of satire and irony for the non-literal viewer.....truly delightful!",/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2002,manipool,9," Missing The Point
","Anyone who thinks that this movie is for anything but the laughs is missing the point. You do not watch Buffy The Vampire Slayer to be scared out of your wits. This movie is funny! From Miss Swanson to Mr. Sutherland to Ruebens, Perry and Arquette, their performances are wonderful! I found this movie to be much better than the series and watch it anytime it comes on television and know most of the lines. Great movie!!",/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2022,redcrossaint,8," Slaying vampires before it was a phenomenon
","The movie follows a bratty, stuck-up cheerleader Buffy Summers (Kristy Swanson) as she learns from Merrick (Donald Sutherland) that she has a destiny to fight vampires. The movie also stars Paul Reubens and Rutger Hauer as vampires that Buffy goes up against.",/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2002,canesflyers,10," Campy and Fun
","This movie was meant to be funny not serious and dark.  It is great for a few laughs provided you keep an open mind.  Paul Reubens has one of the best death scenes.  It is hilarious.  Joss Whedon has made his apologies for the film and has made up for it. If you want good, serious and a bit dark watch the Buffy TV show.",/review/rw5882660/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2020,donnasaffren,10," Just for F U N
