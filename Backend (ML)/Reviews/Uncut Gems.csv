18 September 2003,Theo Robertson,8," It`s An Account , Not A Statement
","I vividly remembered the news reports in October 1993 of the body of an American serviceman being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu following the battle there . A couple of years later my interest of the battle was rekindled by an edition of the BBC`s excellent history show TIMEWATCH  that spoke to the survivors of "" The biggest firefight involving American troops since Vietnam "" , so when Mark Bowden released his book BLACK HAWK DOWN I opened the first page and found myself unable to put it down , and when I heard Ridley Scott was going to bring Bowden`s book to the big screen I was looking forward to seeing it ",/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2003,kingtanichi,," We were soldiers AND made a great film...
","Black Hawk Down is first and foremost an immensely effective war film, but beyond that, its one of the most subtly differently made war films ever. Most war films usually either have a single hero through whom we see everything (i.e. Platoon), or present us with a squad of soldiers, all of whom are identifiable ""types"" (i.e. Saving Private Ryan). Black Hawk Down takes a different approach, instead giving us a very wide array of characters, none clearly singled out as a hero or type to command the audience's attention. The general effect is to create that feeling of a team army that George C. Scott so ardently expounded to us at the start of Patton. Furthering this feel of military professionalism, the film never cheapens itself by putting too much emotional weight into one moment. The plot moves ahead at a constant pace, cutting from location to location, without slowing down to focus too much on individual soldiers. The effect is of watching documentary footage of a real military operation gone wrong. While the effect of this scripting approach may produce some detachment among viewers on the first viewing, it makes the film all the better on subsequent viewings.",/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2005,DesbUK,8," A very American war story directed by an Englishman
","I've been watching this movie and its accompanying extras on DVD this week for the first time and I thought is ironic that this very American war story should be directed and produced by an Englishman (Ridley Scott) and have a large number of British actors cast as the American servicemen (Ewan McGregor, Jasson Issacs, Hugh Dancy, Euan Bremner, Orlando Bloom.) I suppose it's the equivalent of Steven Spielberg directing a film about the Battle of Goose Green during the Falklands War and casting Americans as members of the Parachute Regiment.",/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," One of the best, and most brutal, war films yet.
",It's an action packed movie with great detailing and difficult direction. I have watched many war movies and their original footage. Black Hawk Down still remains the best for me. And hats off to Hans Zimmer,/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2021,Abdulxoxo,6," Chaotic
","This film has a massive ensemble cast, and every actor played their part well. The action sequences are superbly choreographed with realistic fight/bullet wounds, and practical effects such as explosions. The score by Hans Zimmer adds tensity in the action that's taking place. The cinematography and color choices are good for the film's setting and story. However, I had a hard wanting to care for the characters. They are barely developed and indistinguishable. It's hard keeping track of who's who. The story is simplistic and one-sided. A bit insight into the Somali's point of view of the event would have help the movie to be much more intriguing. Overall, a well-made movie with great production value and good performances but that aren't enough to redeem the trite plot.",/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2019,harrylosborne,7," A big budget, low substance war film
","If you read other reviews of Black Hawk Down, people praise the realism of the conflict in Somalia, along with the accurate portrayals of the American forces against the rebelling usurpers. However, these people seem to 1) have no idea what the conflict in Somalia was actually like, and 2) be completely blinded by the film's huge budget allowing a lot of dramatic set pieces.",/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2002,shades033,10," One of the best war movies of all time
","When talking about war movies, there are many great ones that immediately spring to mind. Since the 70's, three of them have formed a bit of a holy trinity: Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, and Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. These three movies have set the bar for all other war movies that have come along since then. When it was announced that Gladiator director, Ridley Scott, would be adapting Mark Bowden's book, Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War, filmgoers knew that they would be in for a treat.",/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2004,BettieTeese,," Tells it like it is
","I'm not a fan of war movies usually,but when i sat down to watch Black Hawk Down,i couldn't turn it off.Heres a war movie which doesn't sugar coat.There is no crappy dialogue,no soppy love story tie ins,just the real deal,brutal battle scenes,the gruesome reality of war.Black Hawk Down is based on a true story,the bloody battle at Somalia and it leaves one drained.Its confronting,and exposes war in its true light-there's nothing glamorous to see.In two hours and a bit the viewer is able to imagine being there at the horrible battleground,and suffering like the soldiers did.It really makes you appreciate how lucky we are to be in a free country,relatively peaceful,and not having our lives threatened every second of the day.Everything about BHD is right; the setting of the film,the Somalians,the American soldiers going through hell,the brutality,the battle,the",/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2015,Leofwine_draca,9," Top-notch war film and one of Ridley Scott's best
","Gripping, exciting and downright dramatic, this war drama from Ridley Scott is another notch in the director's blossoming career (following on from the disappointing HANNIBAL). Scott handles both the drama and action with flair and skill and the result is an epic-feeling movie which, following on from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, shows you what war is really all about. Forget the long-gone days of cinema where soldiers never got dirty and war was glamourised to the extreme; this is a film that puts you right into the thick of the action, making you feel like you're actually taking part in the battle. The realism is thick and at the end of the film you feel exhausted so you know the work has paid off.",/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2004,bob the moo,," As an intense war movie it really works. But as a true story it is jingoistic and about as selfless and giving as masturbation
","In Somalia, warlord Farah Aideed controls the people and uses hunger as a weapon by stopping UN food supplies reaching his people.  The US military tries to usurp the rule of Aideed but, after 6 weeks, he is still in power and the US demands faster action.  When the military are informed of the location of two of Aideed's top men a mission is put together to catch them. However, when one of the Black Hawk helicopters is hit and crashes, several soldiers are left behind enemy lines, starting a battle for survival and rescue against the hordes of armed Somalis.",/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2005,dberman-2,9," one of the best ACCURATE war movies
","Unlike most of the war movies of our time, Black Hawk Down sticks to the facts about what happened in Mogadishu and doesn't romanticize the story. To support this observation, the viewer will notice that there is not really one main character. This shows that the film focuses more on what happened in Somalia instead of on the characters personality and/or struggles. Another important aspect of the film that makes it so great is the cinematography. Not only was the setting of the film accurate to the real thing, but the way that the movie was filmed is great because it seems like someone is running along the battle scene getting everything on tape. In addition, the film contains small aspects that one may not notice that are important to the situation in Mogadishu. For instance, the bullet shells that fell from the firing helicopter fell into one of the soldiers' vests, and he scrambled to get it out because of how hot it was. This small detail makes the movie that much more realistic. To conclude, Black Hawk Down is a great movie that is both an eye opener that sticks to the facts as well as a quality film. I recommend this movie to any war-film fan, as well as anyone that likes watching movies in general.",/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2002,Quinoa1984,9," One of Scott's best films, but not quite on my top 10 list for 2001
","Ridley Scott seems to have a knack for high intensity in movie-making (Gladiator, Blade Runner, Hannibal and Thelma and Louise among others come to mind) and Black Hawk Down, a war picture set in Somalia, is another prime example of his knack. Black Hawk Down is a war movie that does something I haven't seen much (or dare I say haven't seen at all) which is not going directly into the battle scenes, but instead keeping the audience in check with how the soldiers are reacting and feeling and never diverging much from the action. It is a daring move by Scott.",/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2002,jotix100,10," War is hell
","This film is more realistic than the tepid pictures that were produced  in the Hollywood of World War II. You have to give credit to the director, Ridley Scott, to come out with a winning movie that is totally engrossing and that keeps you at the edge of your seat all the time. The only sad part is that we never get to know the feelings on the Somali people that battled the American power to the bitter end. So in that sense, this film is a one-sided account of what went on, told to us from the American viewpoint, which is well and good, but we never get to hear from the other side, except the short scene from one of the Somali warlord and General Garrison.",/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2019,classicsoncall,9," ""You're looking at the guy who believed the commercials. About be all you can be.""
","Be prepared for a battle scene that's the longest and most relentlessly intense one you'll ever likely find in a war movie. It all results from a failed mission to extract a Somali warlord's top two advisers, going horribly wrong when first one, and then a second Black Hawk helicopter are brought down by enemy fire in the Somali city of Mogadishu on October 3rd, 1993. Operating under the military dictum of leaving no man behind, members of Delta Special Forces and Army Rangers go into action that's extremely up close, violent and bloody. What one witnesses almost makes it feel like you're actually there, as the drawn out battle makes you wonder if it will ever be over. Oscars for sound and film editing went to this picture and it's not surprising to see why. It's almost two and a half hours of gritty war footage that tests the camaraderie, spirit and resilience of American fighting forces in a virtually impossible situation. Not without it's casualties, the American side loses nineteen of it's bravest while inflicting untold damage on the Somali capital and a thousand of it's fanatical adherents to Mohammed Aidid. A brief moment of triumph is allowed at the finale as regular Somali citizens enduring hardship and starvation under Aidid welcome the American soldiers who tried to make things right. It's not enough though, to make it seem like the Special Forces and Army Rangers were victorious.",/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2002,shea_bennett,," Outstanding
","When you break it down and look at it both honestly and cynically (assuming that that is possible for a minute), there are really only two kinds of war movie: pro and con. The underlying theme of virtually every war movie - particularly since APOCALYPSE NOW - generally comes down to an analysis of the 'value' of war, of its worth. It's pointlessness, or its need. Is the action of battle warranted because of the attempt to find peace, or is war never justifiable, no matter what the intention?",/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2003,Jonny_Numb,1," high beams in a thick fog
","I find it ironic that many of the comments being circulated from outside (rather luckily, I'd say) the hornet's nest of U.S. news media are doling out the most thoughtful and reasonable opinions on why ""Black Hawk Down"" is such a rank slice of flag-waving propaganda.  Those who say, in so many words, ""leave your politics at the door"" are the ones who are missing the point of a democratic society--even in something as simple as film criticism, dissent is not a privilege, but a right for all people who disagree with the preset opinions of others.",/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2002,ptheus,10," I Felt Like I Was in that Black Hawk
","Black Hawk is quite simply the best movie of the year (2001) and the best war movie I have seen.  It's an astonishing achievement that puts you right in the middle of the hellish horror faced by U.S. soldiers in Somalia in 1993. Every explosion startled me and filled me fear, every gunshot felt like it was whizzing right by me, every mistake or unforeseen event had me on the edge of my seat with stress and anger. I felt as though I had been transported to Mogadishu for 2.5 hours and plopped in the middle of the ambush faced by the 100 or so U.S. Rangers and Delta Force Troops as they set about to capture a Somalian warlord responsible for stealing Red Cross food shipments in his starvation-ravaged country. I really felt this movie, it was tangible to me; the confusion, the fear, the sense of dislocation and horror the soldiers must have faced. At the end I was emotionally and mentally drained.",/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv

10 December 2020,random-70778,," Considered by combat veterans to be the most accurate war film
","Firstly I can NOT believe that some of the silly haters here are complain the the cast is all male. It is set in 1993, and the US order of battle has rangers and even more élite troops. In 1993 that is going to be all male.
Then we have ignorant complaints here about the Pakistani troops not hihglighted. Well Operation Restore Hope in Mogadishu had a series of battles and incidents, and the ""Black Hawk Down"" incident was the result of the US being asked by the Pakistanis to help after 20 or so of their solders were killed in an ambush by Mohamed Farrah Aidid. The film does not pretend to tell the whole back and forth of all the battles but specifically and only the Oct 3-4 part of Gothic Spear op. Lastly a few deluded PC people are whining the film is racist, because, well Somalis are, well, Somali looking. That is absurd.",/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2002,mm-39,8," Realistic
","This movie is a factually based, and done in a way of a real life documentary.  My friend Tony told me about the book, and its pretty close to the movie.    There is a mention(very lightly) about not having heavy armor, from what Tony told me because it would look bad on CNN, and if I remember right this event cost Bill Clinton about 17 points in the polls, he would have lost the election if it was called right away.  I don't think CNN will affect foreign policy again, when they called for the US to help out a country, and Bush being ex CIA chief just wanted to convoy some food and get the hell out.  This movie shows why.  It's not a action movie I would call it more of a war/horror movie.  We see what army life is about, how well trained the special forces are, and the confusion, and horror of war.  The film is one constant feel of fear.  It was accurate, but according to Tony left  some of the grimmer parts out.  Where the troops got lost because the city has no street names, a lot of women and children died because the war lords used them as shields, and spotters.  You really feel bad for the men, and it must have been an eternity for help to arrive.",/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2010,Vishal_s_kumar,10," Ridley Scott's harrowing film is a revelation
","Black Hawk Down premiered in December of 2001, a mere three months after the world had faced the harsh reality of the September 11th terrorist attacks on New York and Washington D.C. I vividly remember a small controversy brewing at that time, questioning the film's release in the wake of the attacks. Apparently, some critics felt that the film was arriving too soon after the attacks and that audiences weren't ready to see a film that dealt with the realities of the military and terrorism. Despite those concerns, the film was heralded as an instant classic; moviegoers responded by turning up in droves. Perhaps the reason behind Black Hawk Down's success lies in the strong sense of optimism the film displays, in spite of the tragedy that it portrays on screen.",/review/rw0767866/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Enlightenment introduced a new version of honour, based on the idea of war as a rule-bound, principled undertaking. This illusion was somewhat shattered in WW1, when millions were mowed down on the mechanised killing fields.
