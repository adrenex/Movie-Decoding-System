21 April 2020,Zedyeti,6," Don't expect football
",Show started off good and interesting. Then it becomes an annoying soap opera and drags on and on like a bad after school special. Everyone is super depressing and there is rarely any football being played especially season 2. If you're really into pointless drama then this show is perfect for you.,/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2019,KOOLAIDBRO,8," It's cheesy, but it's good cheese
","It's like The O.C. collided with Friday Night Lights. It's cliche and cheesy, but it's entertaining. I went in expecting the worst and I enjoyed it.",/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2021,JodyKibler,1," Season 1 and 2 good 3 junk
","Season 3 is built on lies and junk. I think they missed the point this was a football story with some sub plots. There is nothing about football now, just a propaganda machine.",/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2021,nicholasbyers,4," Season1 good season 2 bad season 3 terrible
",This show started off good but season 3 ruined it with political messaging. Season 1 was just about football and now the show is about school drama and politics with little talk about football.,/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2021,chadhunter-59180,1," Liked it until Season 3 political bs
",Liked this series until it got too political in Season 3. I was still watching Season 3 till episode 12. Forfeited last game to end the season. Ok that was the last draw. Leave the politics out ffs.,/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2021,hognls-57954,1," Not worth the time
","Too bad BLM has infected this series. Season 4 is so off base, never saw this coming. I watch for entertainment not someone's political agenda. Typical Netflix pandering.",/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2022,Coralknight,6," Goes from great to horribly wrong
","The first and second seasons were thought-provoking, well-written and you almost believe there is a consultant on staff who lived in S Central LA that gave insight into life there as opposed to the typical Hollywood cliches. The background character studies were in depth for the principle cast and the sub-plot about the family issues made the series very 3-dimensional (although at times typically sappy and predictable as once would expect from a TV series). But in season 3, the show ""jumps the shark"" and becomes a typical mouthpiece for Hollywood elites, crying for ""defund the police"" and citing a police ""war on our people"" (the typical talking-points of the left) and forget about the actual depth of the previous character study. Watch the first 2 seasons...then pretend the rest don't exist.",/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2021,franklinfrank-95805,4," Season 3.
",I was enjoying this show until Season 3. They lost it..so sad :(,/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2020,jakebrann,2," Wanted to like it... almost no football played!
","I really wanted to like this show. Like everyone has said it's so full of cliches. This is supposed to be a series that revolves around the football career of someone and there is so little football played and it's basically just a teenage soap opera. The main character and ""star"" athlete 5 episodes in has done nothing but fumble the football and lose football games for his team. The drama of this series is almost too much. I really wanted to like it and watch a good football series. Every episode basically requires you to suspend belief and believe that high school students are capable of pulling off all the crap they do in this show. Its very unrealistic.",/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2022,BadurBey,6," Seasons 1 and 2 good, seasons 3 and 4 bad
",Overall this show is a 6.7/10 with a pretty great first season.,/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2020,carniassada,5," first season was good but...
","I enjoyed the first season because it focused on the highschool football aspect. The second season devolved into silly teen drama and no more football. Hundred dollar tickets for an amateur rap show at a roller rink, come on.",/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2020,chaitanyamisal,3," Continuous drama with bipolar characters
","The series is full of cliche drama that just goes on and on in every scene.
Characters seem mature having level headed conversations in one scene and come across as completely childish in another scene. The whole things doesn't make sense.",/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2018,ryanwcar,8," cliche'd as can be... But that might be alright
",It's your typical smart kid with athletic talent but from a rough black part of town but they're doing it with flair and style. Everything so far is cliche'd to 11 but it's done decently well and the characters seem to be able to halfway act. This should have been way worse than it was and I'll tune in next week and perhaps a few more after that.. 8/10,/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2021,jasongerrish,1," What high school allows 30 year old students?
",Having a hard time seeing this as high school when the actors are legit 30 years old,/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2021,chrisfong-63871,3," Way to political
",3rd season just made me mad. Zero football and just shoving politics down my throat you can get a message across without forcing the hell out of it.,/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2021,carolleejones,3," I used to love this show
","More woke politics ruining a good thing by teach I get division, hate, and victim hood. What a shame...you had the perfect platform to teach something honest and unifying. Adios!",/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2022,james313,5," Good at first
","I enjoyed the first two seasons. Most of the focus was on high school football and the challenges faced by the main character. Little bit like a high school soap opera, but not too bad as the storylines were pretty good. Then Season 3 came and I couldn't watch it after the first 6 episodes or so. No longer about football, just politics and woke activism. Not what most people were tuning in for.",/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2018,alejangg,9," Not bad not bad at all
",This show has a little bit of a One tree hill feel to it. I was a big fan of the OTH series and I feel this show has the same potential that show has for many years. Not the greatest acting but I think it will get better. Hoping this show grows to be something great,/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2021,jjpscott01,5," Good God what happened??
","I thought the first two seasons were actually pretty good as far as teen dramas go. It stole a lot of ideas from Friday night lights but I thought it was an above average show. Season three turned into it all into a joke real quick. The woke political angle this season goes against everything good entertainment should be. It's like the directors said ""we feel our viewers aren't getting enough of this trash from the mainstream media and out divided country. Let's just make the entire show about it as well"". A good show can balance a message with some subtlety to really be effective but this has gotten ridiculous. Not sure it can come back from this dumpster fire of a season.",/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2021,mikegambatese,1," Disappointing
","Seasons 1 and 2 were great. Season 3 went down hill horribly. It got so political with BLM written everywhere and kids acting freaked out about seeing a cop. Oh yea football is an after thought now, it's Hardly part of the show.",/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2021,caitlinan,2," Too political
","Season 3 was a completely different show, mostly about politics. Disappointing.",/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv

18 May 2021,juice64011,1," Cheesy but entertaining at the beginning
",Unfortunately this season has been terrible. It really doesn't have anything to do with high school or football anymore.,/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2018,maelee-96009,," Family time
",First TV series my entire family from my wife to my 4 children from ages 16 to three actually agree on and enjoy. Very good acting and great story line so far. Can't wait for next Wednesday night.,/review/rw6856601/?ref_=tt_urv
