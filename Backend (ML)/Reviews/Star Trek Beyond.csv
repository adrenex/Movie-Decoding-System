17 March 2017,intelearts,8," 599th Review - Mockney all the way - and it works.
","This is a well- crafted series that takes the DNA of Guy Ritchies' films and spins it out as a series. Snatch is exactly what fans of Mockney comedy-crime-drama want in their viewing - lags in dire straights, smart birds, who'd knock your top off if you called them that, all with sharp suits and sharper dialogues.

4 April 2017,coyleyofhull,7," What more do you want?
","Its not the movie, I feel when making the show they knew they couldn't make something as good as Snatch, but what I felt they did amazingly is it captures the feel of the movie, with none of the big name actors, yet instead its full with an all young main cast who were very enjoyable to watch together.",/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2017,rick-jatti,8," not snatch, but still good
","if you're looking for a throwback to the original Guy Ritchie masterpiece, this show is not what you are looking for. i was of this mindset before watching the show. what really defined snatch was the range of characters and different personalities that brought it together, and how there wasn't really a definition of bad guy or good guy. in this show, we obviously have some clear villains and the heroes. it tries to do camera angles, zooms, and overall cinematography and editing like the movie did, but not as effectively. the movie's was also heavily predicated on accidental and unintentional mishaps, which are present but not as prevalent in the show. what it is, though, is an enjoyable show with likable characters and pretty solid dialogue and writing. the acting isn't half bad, and the plot is very well thought up. the show is very unpredictable, unlike much of what comes on the screen in the crime genre these days, and i never find myself thinking ""oh, of course that happened"". i will reiterate, this is not the movie, and you will see minimal similarity with the movie, but don't let that cloud the fact that this isn't a bad show by any stretch. i will say that the flashback scenes that start each episode are kind of annoying, but i guess that's just a testament to how much I'm invested in the actual plot of the show. please do not be alarmed by the rating of this show. try at least an episode and a half before you call it quits.",/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv

","Why on earth name this snatch. At least try to make it your own, at least TRY to make it original. ",/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2020,mmk77,3," Why are they so stupid?
","I love the film and though I'd like the series. But that seems impossible. How can I enjoy it when the main characters repeatedly make stupid mistakes?
Really, it's offensive. The main characters are so idiotic and make the most stupid and unbelievable mistakes over and over.
I couldn't get past S01E04 when they let the guy who's tripping balls in charge of the gold and he forgets it in the taxi (wow, no one saw that one coming).
If you want to watch a sequence of incredibly stupid mistakes, the show is for you.",/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2017,cammymitchell,3," There's a lot better out there
","Unbelievable storyline coupled with unbelievable characters, makes this one to miss. The more I watch, the worse it gets. I made the effort to sign up to IMDb, just to leave this review. I've even had to pad it out, cause I need to meet a minimum number of lines, before it meets the criteria for a review and I really don't think it's worth the effort to think of anything constructive to say. I guess I should add the acting is OK.",/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2017,the_it,1," One of the worst shows I have EVER, EVER seen!
","I get this free with my BT subscription, which is the only good thing I can say about this show, which is beyond bad! It's even beyond awful!! I remember the original Snatch at the cinema- I even own it on blue-ray- but this is a poor man's knock off version of the movie. ",/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2017,propsguy,5," Good idea destroyed by laziness and overindulgence.
","This could have been a good show but greed got the better of them. It would have been fine as a six-parter, as it is there is far too much filler. Add that to that the laziness of the writing and you have a mediocre show. ",/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2017,chrisbaca915,10," Unexpectedly great show; I was doubtful... but it was great!
","I'm giving this show a 10 because -- while not perfect, and certainly not very original being that it is based on a classic film -- the series was very fun to watch and, after bingeing on it, I was left thinking about it for days after and wanting more. That, in a world filled with forgettable crap (both original and unoriginal alike), was enough to merit a 10-star review from yours truly. ",/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2017,shoguncrosse,7," 6.9 Rating? Wow, This is so Much Better Than an Almost 7...
","If you loved the movie Snatch then you will love this series...Rupert Grint is especially good in it lol...Great cast all around. Guy Ritchie will be proud I'd imagine...Wish he had a part in doing this series, then it'd be a solid 10 I'm sure - but definitely a 9 if you loved the series, so all in all, I loved this series and hope for a season 2.",/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2017,brucendru,3," Tarnishes the name
","A very lightweight attempt at a TV series very lightly based on the excellent movie. The characters are fluffy pretty definitely not- criminal looking actors and the dialogue is completely uninteresting, unlike in the movie. The raw humor and sense of menace is missing. A real bastardization of the film, and a case study in why a director matters, a script matters, and realism matters. The epitome of why TV usually stinks.",/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2017,maxcottle-1,1," Complete and utter Juvenile nonsense
",This could have been so good It had so much potential but instead they have gone down the line of extraordinarily weak comedy incredibly basic dialogue and well just pure idiocy.,/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2017,adalhild,6," Snatch light, heavily diluted
","In the past year's craze of ""let's capitalize on a successful movie by turning it into a TV-show for nostalgic 30-somethings"", ""Snatch"" follows the same recipe, taking enough elements from the original to justify the use of the name, but still understanding that's it a TV show and needs to be treated accordingly.",/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2017,starktest,10," Absolutely Brilliant, Some of the Best TV in Years - It does the film justice

30 March 2017,nicholasvanryswyck,10," Absolutely Brilliant(Need a season 2)
",This show has been one of the best crafted shows i have watched in a long time The crime drama theme mixed with unbelievable comedy has to be what makes this show as good as it is It is hard not to like this show!!! I am really hoping that the creators of the show decide to make a season two as i am sure plenty of people would love to watch this show for as long as possible,/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2017,ewansuttie,8," Underrated, truly very fun and entertaining.
","First, the TV show isn't like the movie, if anything it feels as if it's trying to be the movie, and at a first glance I was happy to say that it failed at it's ambition. However, this changed over the course of the show. I began thinking less about the movie, and more about the show, the characters began developing, the story began to unfold carefully, though cliché. Snatch isn't about the movie, it's about it's own thing, style is key, characters are strong, the soundtrack is great. ",/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2017,Evanoil,8," Lives up to expectations.
","Highly recommended for anybody who liked the Snatch movie .You cant ask for a perfect remake of the feeling the film gave but surely these series made it very close. The story is old and pretty cliché but the way it was shot and the screenplay are so good that it doesn't even matter. Only problem i had with these series is the length , i feel like 10 episodes is too much for this one , they could have made it 6-7 episodes and tell the whole story they way it lives us wanting more , i felt like i had enough on the 8th episode. If you have not seen Snatch the movie , you better go and watch it before starting the series ,although it is not critical , it will be better that way.",/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2018,spikeneil-84-836952,3," Me cago en la leche
",The first thing that annoys me about this series is that it portrays the Spanish as an inferior race....Typical British mentality!! Series 1 was ok but series 2 is a piss take. Dumbed down version of a decent original story for the dickwit masses,/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2017,jaylouise27,9," Worth watching all 10 episodes
","A very good watch, looking forward to watching the relationships develop in Season 2. Similar format to the film but individual enough to keep it fresh and relevant. Well written with characters that have room to grow in future episodes and definitely kept me wanting to watch one after the other. Give it a try!",/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2017,lg-62904,5," Mild - Lacking flavour. Can be likened to a bland meal.
","Much like a bland meal, this series was digestible, however lacked the depth and intensity of flavour characterised by so many great series. This was like a dry jacobs cream cracker. I mean I'm a man that can take a certain amount of satisfaction in eating a certain amount of dry jacobs cream crackers but after a while it does get somewhat tiresome. I think the actors are not to be blamed. They have done the best job with what they've got here, but the writers/producers/directors whilst not entirely doing a bad job, should be shot. Sit the writers down and make them watch all seasons of The Sopranos or any other great series let them learn some lessons, cah fa real, they've let every one down with this and that's not to say it's crap cos it's not but come on mate, the last episode especially, they run out of the warehouse with that money and straight out to about 10 cop cars and then proceed to put the money in the van without so much as one copper outside, the whole thing gets quite unbelievable in places. Also Rupter Grint is annoying, don't know why, he's just got one of those faces.",/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2019,punch_p,2," Snatch becomes tiresome in its constant attempts to dazzle the viewer.
","It's one thing to make a world of robbers, crooks, and murderers look like a Calvin Klein ad, but the fact that Snatch isn't even particularly interested in the criminal mind is what ultimately sinks the whole enterprise.",/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2019,robmatthewsjr,8," Very good show

10 April 2017,gingerrogers-83623,10," Something for everyone.
","If you're looking for an exact remake of the original film this show is not it. However that doesn't meant that it isn't awesome. The show is a loving wink and nod to the movie, incorporating familiar bit's and pieces along with camera shots reminiscent of Guy Ritchie's style. ",/review/rw3868856/?ref_=tt_urv
