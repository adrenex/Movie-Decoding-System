25 December 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Got better every season!
","Agents of Shield was one of the best and most underrated superhero shows ever created. The first season wasn't any good so some people stopped watching which was a big mistake. I barely made it through the first season myself but if you can power through it you won't regret it. Like many people here have already said, each season gets better than the one before it. It starts off as a spin-off from The Avengers as it follows S. H. I. E. L. D. one year after that first movie and is originally part of the MCU. Then they made the incredible choice to break away and make the show their own, and that's when it gets good.! It follows a S. H. I. E. L. D. team led by Phil Coulson and the rest of his team (Daisy ""Skye"" Johnson, Melinda May, Mack, Leopold Fitz, Jemma Simmons, Grant Ward, Yo-Yo, Deke and more characters that come and go throughout the seasons). It has some of the best writing for a superhero show and some of the best characters. If you haven't seen this yet or stopped watching after that terrible first season then do yourself a favor and go watch this as soon as possible.",/review/rw3458693/?ref_=tt_urv

23 July 2022,leonmessyb,9," I'm really going to miss this show!!!
","When you first start watching this show, you think what kind of cheesy Sci-fi nonsense have I signed up for? Where are all the Avengers!? BUT if you are patient and stick it out past the first season, you are in for some of the BEST TV you've possibly seen and definitely in the Sci-fi/Superhero genres!! This show only gets better as it goes on, and the last 2 seasons are especially gripping and exciting! I literally binge-watched the last season in under 48 hours. I'm really sad I've finished it now, but I am SO HAPPY I watched it. Great ending to a GREAT SHOW!! I cannot recommend enough!! ENJOYYYYY!!!",/review/rw3458693/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2021,Supermanfan-13,9," Already miss it!
",Agents of Shield was such a great show. If you can get past the first season (which was by far the worst season) I guarantee that you will enjoy the rest! It just took a while to gets it's footing but once it did it was one of the best shows on tv. It's one of the rare shows where every season just gets better and better! I already miss it!,/review/rw3458693/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,AnnaPagrati,10," Adore this so much!

",I have to admit that I was less than thrilled with this show's beginning. I didn't think the characters were well defined and the plot seemed very lackluster.,/review/rw3458693/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2018,noorea-85147,," My Favourite show!
","This show is simply amazing, it has great writing, superb acting, unpredictable storylines, deep and interesting themes, great attention to details, and amazing pacing, it's the best show when it comes to using a 22 episode season without being full of filler.
The characters on this show are quite well written, they feel, talk and act like real humans , I care about all of them to some extent..in fact, I might be more invested in their lives than I am my real friends..oops! It's not only the main characters though, I often find myself really loving characters that only show up for few episodes, all the props to the writers and the cast.
Now the show isn't perfect, it does take some time to gain momentum, the first season while enjoyable is rather slow compared to the rest of the show. also the show tends drop storylines or leave some things unexplained, that doesn't bother me personally, but might bother others.
There is also the connections to the rest of the MCU, which some people see as not enough, others too much, and yeah it can be a bit frustrating when the crossovers you imagine don't come through, but it's not something I'd hold against this show, I think they write around the MCU well enough, all things considered. In fact, I like that the show adds a 3rd dimension to the movies, It is more interesting to me than characters showing up for a quick team up or the like.",/review/rw3458693/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2022,glstrom-14260,8," Long strange trip
","I watched episode one having enjoyed Coulson from Avengers and Marvel movies and 4 weeks later have finally reached end of the journey. I do remember it on network tv but the ads were too onerous, and thankfully these move right along. While some of the plotlines were repetitive (justs F ing die already Hydra), formulaic or silly (seriously, Deke in 80s stealing songs) the theme of family and caring for one another was always strong, and the ensemble stronger. Coulson is cool, Daisy is hot, and funny, Yo Yo also funny and sincere, and Agent May (except for forced relationship with PJC) was solid. Fitz and Jemma the glue that held it all together it seems, glad for their happy ending. Trips to the past and future a challenge the CG dept. Did well with, and though tempted to bail from time to time am quite glad to stay to see the end.",/review/rw3458693/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2022,zain_ahmed,10," It was a golden age of Marvel TV shows
","I am doing a rewatch and just couldn't help but appreciate how good this show is compared to all current Marvel Studios shows. The depth of every character is insane. The storyline is amazing! Don't get me wrong, the show has had its bad days, but overall it's absolutely amazing! I love that they used to make so many episodes in every season. Now, just 6. It's extremely underrated. MCU canon or not, this show has created its own league. Every season is like a brand new TV series and all the seasons competing with each other. Hope to see some of these characters appearing in future MCU projects.",/review/rw3458693/?ref_=tt_urv

",I fell in love with this show right off and have kept watching although I'm am not finished seeing all seasons and episodes due to working alot. I know the show is over but I'm gonna watch it through and soon after but all the bluray disc for keeping. I think the producers did a fantastic job of it all bravo and I Hope they have more great sci-fi in future to give us.,/review/rw3458693/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2022,levipennington,8," Deserves to be MCU canon
","I had never heard of this show for a while and when I did, I was skeptic. I thought what was the point and it didn't affect the MCU so why should I watch it. But then I saw a picture of Coulson on it and that it took place after his death, and my curiosity got the better of me. You know what they say curiosity killed the cat.",/review/rw3458693/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2017,ChrisInMiami,9," every season gets better, season 4 is where it makes its mark on TV
","Its such a clichÃ© to say that every season gets better, I know. But M.A.O.S does just that. As Season 1 wound down, there was speculation that the storytelling wouldn't support the longevity. We wanted to see our favorite heroes from the Marvel Universe but even tie ins with other marvel characters such as Jamie Alexander as Sif from Thor and Sam Jackson as Nick Fury felt like hand me downs from an older sibling. Luckily we got a season 2 and so on. The show's strength seems to be that every new season seems to turn the story on its head and milk more action and drama. With season 4, the show has finally reached a point where it doesn't need any gimmicks. At this point, who cares about the other MCU characters! These characters own their own universe right now. At this point I'd rather see them make an appearance in one of the MCU movies! Season 4 did give us the best Ghost Rider we've ever seen... Now I want to see a Robbie Reyes movie. The season 4 storyline with the LMD's and especially ep 4.15 reminds me of when Star Trek Next Generation finally grew out of the shadow of the original and proved it could carry itself on its own merit. Well done guys.... BRAVO!",/review/rw3458693/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2022,No-Life-101,7," Fun to watch!
","From what I've seen of the show (haven't gotten around to finishing the last 2 seasons) it's really good, I love all of the characters and the story is well written. One day I'll have to rewatch the whole show!",/review/rw3458693/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2018,kdupes-1,9," Really great show !
","Took me a long time to watch this, And then I watched only half of the first episode and quit. Then I finally went back to it and.... damn glad I did !
> If you like spy type shows like Alias or Nikita then you'll like this.
> You've also got some sci-if added into the spy/ crime fighting theme.
If you like The 100, Battlestar Galactica or Stargate movie/series then you'll love this show.
I could not wait to find out what happened in the next episode.
I'm so glad I could just hit ""next"" and not have to wait a week.",/review/rw3458693/?ref_=tt_urv

4 August 2022,shivanidiwakar,7," ITS ONLY GET'S BETTER
","I admit season 1 is not good but it ain't that bad. Season 1 sets up stories for at least 5 next seasons. They didn't really got good budget that's a main problem but I will say they are lucky they got the best CAST. The show is cool spy show with great gadgets, unpredictable twist and great storyline but what makes this show outstanding is the characters. From season 1 the characters you got they are no where near in end. Character development in this show is one of best I have seen, best example is LEOPOLD FITZ. He is so complex when watched season 1 I didn't thought out of everyone he will get the best development. I love everyone in this show especially FITZ, SIMMONS, DAISY, COULSON, MAY the original but the additional character are also great HUNTER AND BOBBY, MACK, YOYO. And WARD is like a person you hate but you want hum around. He was probably my fav villain in the show, he hurt og more than anyone else. I loved to Hate him. Season 4 is one of the best tv seasons by far. Season 4 will show ya what DARKHOLD can do.",/review/rw3458693/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2020,CelestialKing,9," Underrated Hidden Gem of Marvel
","It started really slow on season 1 kept on watching for the fact that Phil Coulson was in it but my god what a journey the show has made for past 7 years. It was emotional, humorous, action packed, thrilling and intriguing. The ending season was basically a gift to long time watchers by bringing back so many old faces and story-lines from previous seasons. Very logical and satisfying ending of the series and creating a big possibility for spin-offs.",/review/rw3458693/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2018,yagooga,10," Brilliant , intriguing and thrilling
","Agents of SHIELD is by far the best TV show based on Comic character (beside Netflix Marvel series like Jessica Jones Luck Cage , Daredevil and Iron Fist ) 
the characters are well develope . It's not like typical Superhero show with particular Villian and our hero defeat him and save the world , it's very complex and well written . the story is running parallel with the Marvel's movies (but without huge spoilers ) , and make you feel that marvel's world is so big and connected .
 Phil Coulson is the protagonist in the show but they don't focus on that , they give other character a very huge part in the story and you keep forgetting that there is a central character , and the character are so intersting , facinating and complex . 
It's worth watching and i hope they continue produce more seasons .",/review/rw3458693/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2022,drdoc-94715,10," Still the best thing from Marvel
","Personally even with all the new stuff coming out of Disney/Marvel, this is still the best TV show Marvel has done. Only slightly trumps Daredevil just because of the heart and characters! It's a yearly re-watch! And I love the ending! I just wish Disney Marvel would carry it on some way.",/review/rw3458693/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2022,mediaabsorber,10," Why did I wait to watch this?
","I picked up on this show quite late because I saw that it was seven seasons which quite much compared to the other Marvel shows I watched first on Disney+. The show drags on for quite long, but it did not waste my time at all. It kept me locked to the screen whenever I watched it. The story is very captivating, and the arcs of the characters throughout the show were very satisfying even with the show not being afraid to be a bit experimental. As the seasons go on, the better the show gets. I just cannot put into words how phenomenal this show is and it should get more recognition. I seriously pity those who stopped watching this show during the beginning seasons. Their loss.",/review/rw3458693/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2016,ericstevenson,10," Faithful to Marvel Comics
","I admit that the only thing that made me interested in this was probably how it was a spin off of the much loved ""Avengers"" movie. It was great to see such a popular movie franchise with so much continuity get expanded into new media. Yeah, I do kind of wish there were more characters from Marvel Comics. It was great to see some like Absorbing Man. Agent Coulson works so well in this. It was tons of fun to have Samuel L. Jackson appear as Nick Fury.",/review/rw3458693/?ref_=tt_urv
