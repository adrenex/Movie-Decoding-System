3 November 2009,johnnymacbest,9," Riveting!!! Best premiere I've ever seen!!
","Having not been familiar with the original ""V"" the series by creator Kenneth Johnson, and upon first glance at the previews and TV spots, I gotta say that what I just witnessed was the best pilot episode I've ever seen. With it's many parallels to our social climate in the world today, the new series plays on our fears and perceptions of those who are strangers to us who at first are well-meaning and docile but their ulterior motives are hidden underneath. That gives ""V"" verisimilitude while still retaining a Sci-Fi setting. I was tense and on the edge of my seat throughout the proceedings of what the characters are experiencing as the ""visitors"" announce their presence to the world. I suppose some will say that the new ""V"" is not as good as the original, but I for one, enjoy this new version and will be tuning in to see how the events unfold and how profoundly their effects will have on those embroiled in this event that may change the face of mankind forever.",/review/rw8167872/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2009,Zen416,9," Finally, an ABC show worth watching....
","...and that's saying a lot considering the usual angst-y, inexpensive-to-make-therefore-let's-clone-it-family-drama shows the network seems to keep adding on or re-newing. ""V"" was exciting right from the start and the second episode was a good follow-up to the premiere, fleshing out the main characters a bit more and what drives them. Elizabeth Mitchell is well cast as straight-shooter, no-BS FBI agent Erica and it's great to see her back on the tube after ""Lost"". Another great bit of casting is Joel Gretsch as Father Jack, a priest torn between doing what he thinks he's supposed to be doing and what he knows in his heart is actually the right thing to do. Gretsch was great as the power-hungry military man in the sci-fi mini ""Taken"" so seeing him here playing the clerical good guy with heart shows the man's got talent. Morena Baccarin and Scott Wolf are also excellently cast as Anna the high commander of the Visitors and as Chad, the button-pushing journalist. Though I enjoyed the original series as a kid, this one is a worthy update for the twenty-first century. Some stuff has changed (names of characters; how long they've actually been here before the arrival of the ships, etc.) but the premise is similar enough: aliens arrive on Earth...are they good or bad? It took courage for ABC to air a unique series like this (i.e. ""sci-fi"") when pretty much all of the other mainstream, non-cable networks are sticking with the usual safe stuff (family dramas, medical dramas, cop dramas, 30 minute sitcoms) so I hope they truly give it a chance to grow and catch on. It's that good.",/review/rw8167872/?ref_=tt_urv

27 September 2021,markkupost,7," Wasted opportunity
","Original V-miniseries from 1983 was a social commentary of first contact with an alien species that initially appears benevolent, but quickly establishes a propaganda-ridden fascists regime on Earth where non-conformists get persecuted.",/review/rw8167872/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2010,ZenShark,9," Its not the original, so don't look for that.
","This is a remake of the original series V where aliens invade earth. However this is not the original series, so don't compare it to it. It reflects the new changed world political scenario. Unlike the original, in this the resistance is labeled 'terrorist', and there are many shades of gray. The show has a lot of potential, and so far in (9 episodes) it is headed in the right direction. The show does tackle some interesting issues, and handles then reasonably well. To say it is simply an action series is untrue. In fact it does make one realize that if a real alien invasion took place what it may be like. Of course a lot of hypotheses have to be made to come up with such a scenario, but you cant hold the assumptions the show makes against it. The most interesting aspect is how the humans react to the V, as initially they come as saviors. This leads to certain social implications, and even religious implications, and show does not shy away from delving into them. This is show is politically savvy, and that makes it really interesting to watch, because despite the obviously science fiction set- up, there are underlying truths in it about are social make-up.",/review/rw8167872/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2010,michael-hanlon,2," Unexpectedly Dire
","Just watched the pilot. Watchable, just, but a big disappointment. Certainly no match for the original which was (for its time) a riveting piece of sci-fi. The plot itself is OK, it is just so clunking and obvious. Big alien spacecraft hovering over our cities is a good trope, but an old one, and it would be nice to see a new take on it by now (District 9 managed it nicely). Ominous rattling crockery? Check. Big reflections in skyscrapers? Check. Troubled priest? Check. So many unbelievable things - why does no one- NO ONE! - ask the aliens where they are from or what, exactly, they want? Surely the TV guy, on being told not to ask any awkward questions in his interview with Anna, would realise he had the scoop of the century (hey everyone, the aliens are evil! Run for the hills!)? How come that just a few days after these things turn up life seems to be continuing as normal? And why is 'Universal Healthcare' a concept so strange to American ears that it could only come from another planet?",/review/rw8167872/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2009,verbusen,5," So Much For .....Suspense, Sci Fi For The ADD
","I was 20 years old when I saw the original V. That was a big TV event, not a cult series (a cult series implies no one watched it, V was widely watched), and it was riveting. The character development was very good from what I remember, and you did not see the premise of the aliens until well into the series. You had your hunches and were distrustful of the aliens but even when you found out they were mostly bad (yeah we also didn't think there would be a few good aliens till later on either), you didn't know HOW bad they were and that they were lizards! Well after a fairly decent character development up to the first commercial break or two, we knew everything there was to know about it all. Now it's just an action show. I mean so much for the element of surprise or the premise of any suspense. My wife had no idea what this was about and I made sure to not reveal anything telling her it was ""people"" from another planet coming to earth. Well before the first episode ended she knew everything. I'm not going to be all that disappointed because it's no big deal to me, I won't be finishing it thats for sure, but I may look for the original and show that to my wife. Even though the effects are way better now, it doesn't have Michael Ironsides or Marc Singer or Robert Englund in it and it sure as hell does not have any SUSPENSE!!! And whats up with the crucifix crashing down? The writers really have some hidden agenda's that are not that well hidden. And did that resemble New York City to you? I mean come on, looked more like a version of people in Kansas, no realism at all, if you see that ethically homogeneous a population in New York your looking at a 70 year old film, not today, no way, even the homeless looked clean. I also don't recall anything putting down the US government either, I don't really remember seeing Washington DC in any of the shots, I guess that was a sacred cow for the writers but they sure did dump on the Christan faith, oh brother. Got to also love the way they tried to make the journalist so ethical, don't these writers know that now all they do is read teleprompter's? Got to be some elitists from the left coast with all these errors or that this was written down for pre-teens to 17 year old's. I mean the effects looked cool and it actually started out decent, but in the first episode they already have a resistance movement and they just landed? Totally for the short attention span, 5 of 10. See the original, it was very good. Watch Battlestar Galactica if your looking for decent sci fi made today (pssst, they have aliens in that series also).",/review/rw8167872/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2010,Dyellyc,7," Terrible script, miniscule cast
","The creators of this contemporary cut of V seem to have missed the critical elements of the 1983 original, that being character development, a large cast portraying many interesting interleaved plot threads (think any 1970s disaster flic – Airport, Towering Inferno, Poseidon Adventure et al), likable characters (who could ever forget Jane Badler as Diana? or the highly charismatic Willie played by Robert Englund ?)",/review/rw8167872/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2009,black_wolf_1970,1," This show Sucks
","I found that this show tried to rip of aspects of several older great shows. ""The Invaders"".IE: they have been hear for years infiltrating us and melt away when they die, and some unlikely hero finds out and starts fighting back. Kind of also akin to ""The First Wave"" and of course them being Lizards like the original ""V"". This show seems to be trying to mix several older shows together while adding a Bit of ""X-Files"" to the mess and current politics on anti terrorism. If people want to see the good shows watch the originals.........The acting seems to be very wooden almost like they know the show sucks but they agreed to do it so they try to do something. I have yet to see a remake to be better the the original but in this case the remake seem to have but done while at a all night kegger a two year old might have been able to have done a better show.",/review/rw8167872/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2009,dpuczek,," Not Impressed
","I grew up watching the original ""V"" show and remember it being scary and cool - I was like 8 years old though. For last night's premiere, I raced home to watch it and was disappointed at how slow the pacing was. The acting was cardboard and there weren't any twist deviations from the original that I noted. The special effects were borderline at best. The whole luster of the show wears off when the audience already knows A) the aliens are bad guys and B) the ""aliens"" are reptilians under human-like skin. What's the point of re-making a show like this??? Even the ""cut to commercial"" sounds are too much like LOST. Maybe this show will be cool to 8-year olds out there but everyone else can move along.",/review/rw8167872/?ref_=tt_urv

","yet another show i had huge hopes for (Morena Baccarin in the lead? wonderful), but within the first few minutes you could tell it was going to be another bottom-feeding paint-by-numbers waste of attention. I stopped watching after 40 minutes. It really deserves no further comment. Sad that wonderful stuff like Firefly can't catch a ride, but retarded manipulative fluff like this gets the funding. What was that ridiculous Universal Health Care remark? And the whole Trust Hope and Change! thing? Is this nothing more than a big propaganda vehicle for the teabag crowd to nuzzle up with? Stupid stupid and more stupid. Cancel it now. Unfortunately, it's probably going to really big among the people with no working bullshit detectors, i.e. the majority of the American public.",/review/rw8167872/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2011,Maleplatypus,3," A slimy soap-opera masked as SF
","I've learned that the best way to write a reasonable review of the TV- series is to wait (and record) until they air all the episodes and then watch all of them one after another (no week delay). This way the picture looks radically different. So, V is nothing but Dallas, Denver Clan or some Mexican (or Turkish) soap-opera with artificially fabricated plot full of holes, illogical happenings and ""twists"" (all very predictable, as a matter of fact), unexplained events brought up in some episodes, bad acting and casual (I-really-don't-care) production manner. Of course, most of the people craving for SF are willing to swallow up almost anything that even remotely reassembles something like that. This is not it. It's simply a cheap placebo for masses, full of clichés seen so many times before in other forms. They should not have canceled the show. They should not have made it in the first place.",/review/rw8167872/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2011,monticellomeadow,1," One Of The Worst Shows Ever
","ABC has done it again, similar to the way they led you on with Flash Forward last year. They have a show that truly only lends itself to a single season - V really only had a single season's worth of episodes over two years - and then they completely pull their punches, in hopes that if there is another season, they can lure the gullible into watching the next season. If V comes back, I will NOT be among the gullible.",/review/rw8167872/?ref_=tt_urv
