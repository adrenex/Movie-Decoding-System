5 August 2022,arungeorge13,8," A fantastic, no-nonsense re-telling of a real rescue incident! [+78%]
","Maybe, it helps that I didn't watch The Rescue prior to seeing the film, but Ron Howard's work is excellent nonetheless. The film doesn't waste any time getting to its ""rescue mission"" core, bringing in the likes of Viggo Mortensen, Colin Farrell, and eventually Joel Edgerton to help tell this thrilling and utterly grounded tale. Howard ensures that the film doesn't forget where it is set, allowing the region's culture to breathe life into its Thai characters as opposed to showcasing just white sentiment.",/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,rannynm,10," Based On The True Story - Action-Packed And Extremely Suspenseful
",I absolutely loved this film by Ron Howard! Thirteen Lives is based on the true story of thirteen people who got stuck in a flooded cave in Thailand in the summer of 2018. The storyline is action-packed and extremely suspenseful. It felt like my heart was racing a million miles a minute while I watched it.,/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2022,jaimemedina-36288,8," Excellent performances
",Once again Viggo and Colin prove they're among the best in the business. Farrell is so good at transforming himself and he's consistent here. The movie takes few if any liberties for the sake of drama but maintains a taught narrative throughout.,/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2022,Lomax343,9," Human peril - human interest
","Despite the fact the we all know how things are going to turn out, Ron Howard pulls off the same trick he managed in Apollo 13, which is to keep us on the edge of our seats throughout.",/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2022,bheadher,10," Don't expect a blockbuster, it wasn't approached that way...
","The movie is low key throughout, with little hollywood action...I believe that was intentional because this is an account of one of the most miraculous rescues in history. Ron Howard takes us through every aspect of the rescue of 13 boys no one even expected to be alive, With mother nature fighting against the attempt, all the people involved defied the odds and successfully brought them out of that deep cave. One Thai diver died, but from a mechanical malfunction.",/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,katiefanatic-791-306918,9," Absolutely incredible!
","I saw The film at a preview screening with cast today. I implore you, if you can see this movie at a theater, please do so. The experience isn't the same. Really phenomenal film. It's from the perspective of the rescue mission, so be prepared about that. It was so intense and stressful to watch! You know the story but actually watching what happened is much worse. It's really heartbreaking at times. I thought I would cry more but I burst into tears at the end. I think they were tears of relief honestly. Lol I had been holding in so much stress. Everyone in the film did a phenomenal job and the character Viggo played, Rick, was at our screening. So much respect for
This man and all the others who stayed calm under pressure! I only took a point away because the movie gets started practically right away And I would have liked a little more connection to the boys first. Maybe that was the point though.",/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,user-35583,8," Really, really good
","This was better than expected. Could have gone sideways in so many fashions but resists at every turn to become soapish or maudlin or fall into action flick tropes but it does not. In Ron Howard's able hands this amazing true story comes alive with intrigue and emotion. And clocking in at 2 1/2 hours, for me it did not feel overlong or slow.",/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2022,surfingnaked1,10," The best movie I have seen on prime
",This is by far the best movie I have seen on prime video. Good for them to put it up for us. A real movie that everyone can enjoy. And we all know there is a real happy ending. This is a movie about hero's not superhero just regular people being real life hero's.,/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv

9 August 2022,EUyeshima,9," Howard Knows How to Maintain Balance in This Harrowing Reenactment
","Even though we know it all ended well, the risk measures and actual mechanics of the rescue are provided by Ron Howard in harrowing detail in this 2022 movie. Similar to his meticulous approach on ""Apollo 13"", he just knows how to balance the humanity in a rich variety of characters with the focused urgency of the situation at hand. If you can bear witness to the death-defying intensity of the rescue, this one is well worth seeing even though it's longish at 147 minutes. Howard once again proves to be a master filmmaker.",/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2022,zameerpro,9," Thirteen Lives is an emotional roller coaster
","""This is really the superhero movie of the year,"". ""It's a superhero movie with many, many heroes...see this movie because it will give you an idea of...when people get together to help one another, you will make life much easier. There's a lot of love in it.""",/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2022,nonsensefans,10," Brilliant casting with incredible performances !
","First of all, how are they even shooting this dive scenes inside the caves & all ? It was absolutely well done with such a well acted cast. I love all these underrated cast, Viggo Mortensen, Colin Farrell, Joel Edgerton, & Tom Bateman. These amazing cast not only have to potray a character, but has to physically did the stunt performances. Very thrilling & stress to watch not knowing it was that level of difficulty since we've only heard from the news. One of the best inspired survival stories I've seen !",/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,vip-angkoon,10," Attention to details and perfectly portraying all the drama that surrounded the rescue makes this movie so good.
","I am Thai and I went through that time with my eyes glued to news channels and reports. Knowing the outcome doesn't effect the experience much at all. That's how good they made this movie. All the details, the sacrifices, the volunteering and the effort portrayed in this movie was just superb. Ron Howard's Apollo 13 comes to mind. We all knew the outcome but damn were we still on the edge of our seats.",/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2022,chris-94413,9," Well done Ron Howard
","I'm a scuba diver and well aware of the technical challenges of Cave Diving. I'm also well versed in the rescue of these boys having read two books and seen the previous documentaries. What's great about this movie is that it presents the emotional response of the parents and the divers, especially Harry and John and how they had to cope in an incredibly dynamic and challenging situation, moreso above the water, than in the water.",/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv

8 August 2022,ricovegas,9," Wet and wild ride
","Ron Howard is one of the most under rated directors working today. He is almost workman-like in the way he directs. No frills, no unnecessary story lines and rarely, if ever, any manipulation of the story. In Thirteen Lives, he sticks to what he does best - presents the facts and lets the story build its own suspense. For a movie that, I presume, most folks know the ending, this movie will keep you totally engrossed as you ride the roller coaster of emotions that all involved felt. From the distraught families to the mentally and physically drained rescuers, no one escaped without being overcome by the sheer enormity of an attempt to save the lives of these thirteen individuals.",/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2022,kevdexxx,9," Howard nails the tension and emotion perfectly...
","One thing is certain, Ron Howard certainly knows how to make this kind of film, and this is his best in a while and maybe his best ever. Brilliantly made and well paced, capturing all if the emotion and tension of an incredible rescue and international effort. I have previously watched the (also) excellent Nat Geo documentary and this film mirrors that well and adds no typical Hollywood drama to it at all. Truly excellent viewing.",/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2022,leftbanker-1,10," Well Done but Watch ""The Rescue"" First
","I'm glad that I'd seen The Rescue (2021) before coming upon this dramatization of the actual event that is just too incredible to be true. You get to know the real heroes of this story in person. They portray the divers as kooky misfits who just happen to be the best cave divers in the world and the only men who could have pulled this off. The Rescue tells their story in their own, self-deprecating words.",/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2022,TxMike,," July 2018, Thailand, 12 boys and their soccer coach were stranded in a cave.
","Now in 2022 it seems such a short time ago, in June 2018, when news around the world announced that twelve young boys and their soccer coach were trapped in a Thailand cave, trapped by excess rain and rising water. The trip to them was over a mile and took several hours by experienced divers.",/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2022,stevelivesey67,9," Astonishing, brilliant and harrowing

8 August 2022,Silicone54,7," Not as powerful as the Rescue
","I watched the documentary the Rescue several months ago. I already knew a lot of the story and the amazing people involved. Perhaps, if I saw 13 for the first time I might have given it an 8 or 9. But there is nothing compared to the actual people giving their own account of the rescue in their own words. Footage of every aspect of the rescue. The real faces and voices of the boys and their coach.",/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2022,Bonitao,8," Excellent
","Exciting. The film tells the behind-the-scenes of the rescue of the football team that after an unexpected heavy rain are trapped in a cave. The story itself feels like a written plot, with so many coincidences and twists that happen throughout the plot.",/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2022,OneAnjel,9," Spotlights details that aren't in the standard recall of this true story
","I'm familiar with the story but I was still on the edge of my seat for much of this film. Howard has a way of spotlighting the emotional details and he didn't disappoint here. Rather than objectively looking on, we're brought in to the minutia behind the scenes and the intellectual threads among the divers as well as the enormous courage, perseverance, & strength that was required of them. This film really involves the viewer to understand what a Herculean effort this rescue was by thousands of people who worked to exhaustion and then kept going. Amazing. These are true heroes.",/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2022,obi_wan_kenobi_UKR,8," A successful miracle
","I understand those few people who did not like this tape. They explain their position by the fact that everything is too documentary, and some moments do not come out with the original story of the rescue of Thai boys.",/review/rw8506349/?ref_=tt_urv
