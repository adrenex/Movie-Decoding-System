5 June 2020,MAYESY-44,9," Zombie favourite
","Out of all of the zombie based films this is one of my favourites, a really good story from a different angle of a specialist rather than a hero with a gun. Brilliant ending as-well which is always a bonus.",/review/rw2817422/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2013,SnoopyStyle,8," good action thriller
",The world descends into the zombie apocalypse. There is some sort of virus and bitten people are turned into violent creatures. Former UN investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) is caught up with his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and family. They manage to escape and Gerry is put to work on finding the origins of the outbreak. This Brad Pitt showcase has many good points. My only main complaint is the PG13 rating which imposes the cartoon zombie action rather than a gore bloody fare.,/review/rw2817422/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2013,moviemanMA,8," Don't give up
","At the end of World War Z, just as the credits began rolling, a gentleman, scratch that, an idiot spoke up from the back of the theatre exclaiming, ""What? That sucked! The book was nothing like that! Booo!"" I'm sure he scurried away back home, logged online, and began tweeting, posting, and blogging, furthering his rant. Much like my response to him at the theatre, I hope he receives silence in return.",/review/rw2817422/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2019,nogodnomasters,8," MOTHER NATURE IS A SERIAL KILLER
","The world ignores the signs of global disaster and the next thing you know there is a world wide zombie (closer to rabies) pandemic. The incubation period is 12 seconds, yet somehow the infection was able to be transmitted by airplane to the entire world. I am still scratching my head on that one.",/review/rw2817422/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2014,bob the moo,," Good large set-pieces but not so good at producing consistent tension and fear
","I'm generally not a fan of zombie movies, not because I don't like them but rather because they seem to easily have an effect on me, chilling me to the bone and staying with me for days (no walking into dark rooms for me). As a result I put off watching World War Z but I was still interested in seeing such a big budget zombie film. The plot sees some form of outbreak and, well, you know what happens. No sooner has Gerry Lane rescued his family from one city, than he is rescued by his old UN employers who want him to help lead a mission to try and find a solution by escorting a doctor to South Korea. No pressure, but the space for his family in safe haven does rely on him saying ""yes"".",/review/rw2817422/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Loved this movie definitely worth watching
","A good movie with many intense moments, a great plot, and stellar acting. The only downside to this movie is that it is not an original movie-it is one of hundreds of apocalyptic zombie films.",/review/rw2817422/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2014,Leofwine_draca,9," Something new in an overloaded genre
","Yeah, since they hit the mainstream zombie movies have died an (un)death many times over, and I can't help but hark back to the old days where only horror fans knew of the genius of George Romero and Lucio Fulci. Nowadays zombie movies are ten-a-penny and zombies are in the public consciousness alongside vampires and werewolves.",/review/rw2817422/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2021,ma-cortes,8," Breathtaking and thrilling Zombie movie with frenetic action , spectacular scenes and great performances
","A shocking and fantastic drama with daring scenes of the violent Zombies attacking here and there by domineering the entire world. Entertaining flick packing noisy action , drama , humor , violence with lots of blood and gore , and enjoyable relationship among our starring and a group of motley characters with whom he makes relations . Retired U. N. investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) , his wife (Mireille Enos) and children are sitting in what seem to be a typical Philadelphia traffic jam when helicopters started to circle ominously overhead and a blow-up throws the city into panic. In the blink of an eye , the streets are consumed by destruction , chaos and mayhem . When Gerry to be aware that the catalyst for the turmoil is a highly contagious virus that transforms those who contract it into rampaging maniacs and that legions of the infected are growing on all continents , he agrees to join his former partners in discovering the source of the rampant plague . As zombie virus has gutted the United States of America as well as other countries and a team of expert heroes -led by Gerry- is formed so that they find the origin of the horrible plague . Eventually , he meets some doctors (Peter Capaldi , Pierfrancesco Favino , Ruth Negga , Moritz Bleibtreu) from a World Health Organization installation . I can't leave my family ! .Where there is life, there is hope !.",/review/rw2817422/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2013,mwp-036,7," Pretty Good
","Let me start off by saying I haven't read the book yet, so I have no idea how they compare. However, this was a pretty good movie overall. Many zombie movies are merely mindless gore and violence disguised within some fragile thing that doesn't even deserve to be called a plot. However, World War Z has a much better plot than most other zombie movies. One thing I noticed right away is that this movie actually made me jump in surprise several times. It's very suspenseful, and truly worthy of being called a ""zombie horror movie,"" as opposed to the plethora of predictable, unsuspenseful zombie movies that have come out of Hollywood. Brad Pitt does a great job in his role, although I felt his character lacked definition in many ways. It would be nice if they had ""fleshed out"" the characters a bit more.

26 June 2013,Theo Robertson,4," 28 Months Later For Morons
",If a film is sold by a trailer it's this one . I've never read the source novel but do know it is structured as reportage where the world has been changed by a zombie infestation leading to a new geo-political shape for the world so in many ways this is more of a prequel than an adaptation . I did like Danny Boyle's genre shattering 28 DAYS LATER and loved the sequel and unfortunately it looks like that franchise has ended so in some ways this could be a surrogate 28 MONTHS LATER . Add to this the trailers where the waves of infected storm barriers against heavily armed soldiers and we've got a Zombie classic in the making don't we ?No we don't because this is a film that gives the impression that it was written and made by zombies ,/review/rw2817422/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2013,fosterino,5," A Very Puzzling Missed Opportunity
","The story of how World War Z was made is a lot more harrowing and suspenseful than the film itself. After going way over-budget and enduing a complete revision and reshoot of the final act, WWZ wasn't exactly set up for success. Ultimately the movie is completely forgettable and uneven, but not offensively bad or objectively terrible in any sense. What struck me about it was how much of a wasted opportunity it was, given how interesting and entertaining the source material is.",/review/rw2817422/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2013,TxMike,," A good-looking movie that entertains, but mostly just yet another Zombie movie.
","Movies about Zombies is not my favorite genre. In fact I would normally not see them because to me they are just overly silly. The whole concept of ""the undead"", people getting bitten and literally in 10 seconds or so changing into a Zombie. Stuff for cartoons but not for a serious dramatic movie.",/review/rw2817422/?ref_=tt_urv

1 July 2013,aaronjbong,7," Fun, Exciting and Surprisingly Bloodless
","""World War Z"", despite involving zombies, plays more to the likes of a disaster film instead of a zombie film. It's more of like ""2012"" than ""Resident Evil"". We see shots of cities tumbling down to the rule of zombies and the world slowly turns into a zombie wasteland. The zombie attacks are large-scale, grand, and extremely exciting, save for the climax which ends up as a small-scale sequence, but is equally satisfying. ",/review/rw2817422/?ref_=tt_urv

27 June 2013,FilmMuscle,7," World War Z is an entertaining, fun night out but not original in the slightest
","Finally, after years of facing difficulty with production and resources, World War Z has come our way, and it promises an epic and grandeur scale. The film definitely contains most of the elements fans have always desired in a zombie movie; it actually mixes horror, suspense, and action all in one movie. One act transpires underneath the roofs of a daunting apartment building when another act takes the audience across the world to Israel where the people left are forced to defend themselves against a monstrously colossal horde of zombies as they pile in. There are jump-scares. There are grisly and highly unfortunate deaths. ",/review/rw2817422/?ref_=tt_urv

","Oh, Hollywood. You saw the zombie apocalypse coming didn't you?

10 March 2020,dombspace,," More sinister than 7 years ago

21 June 2013,Big_D_Box_Office_Score,9," A great modern-day zombie flick!
","As a regular horror movie, it has everything you want. There are some genuine, high-quality scare moments that will make you jump. The infected look creepy as hell, yet realistically believable. THIS COULD HAPPEN RIGHT NOW. THERE COULD BE A HUMAN-ZOMBIE TIDAL WAVE OF BODIES FLOWING DOWN THE STREET OUTSIDE YOUR JOB RIGHT NOW, WAITING TO ENGULF YOU AS SOON AS YOU TAKE YOUR FIRST STEP OUTSIDE. AND IT WOULD LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THIS. Visually, it is beautiful in its realism, and gives you an idea of how an outbreak like this would actually look in a huge city.
