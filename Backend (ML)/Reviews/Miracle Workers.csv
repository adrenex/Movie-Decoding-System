19 October 2022,ferguson-6,7," through a mother's eyes
","Greetings again from the darkness. Don't look away. Whether referring to Mamie Till-Mobley telling family members to look at the disfigured boy in the casket, or to the general counsel to all citizens in this day of division, the sentiment is the same ... see with your own eyes so that you understand the injustice. Writer-director Chinonye Chukwu (CLEMENCY, 2019) and her co-writers Michael Reilly and Keith Beauchamp allow us to see the tragic story of Emmett Till through the eyes of his mother, and it's a powerful approach. It's Mr. Beauchamp who has diligently researched this story for almost 25 years, and was the driving force behind the 2005 documentary, THE UNTOLD STORY OF EMMETT LOUIS TILL.",/review/rw8695238/?ref_=tt_urv

27 November 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," About 20-40 minutes too long.
","This film stretched out every scene to the max, and had many that weren't even needed. All casting and performances were excellent, and that's what stood out the most for me in this film. I couldn't even recognize Whoopi cast as the grandmother and had to ask Alexa ""who is cast in the movie Till"" to confirm it was in fact her - very impressive. I also discovered that Alexa pronounces Goldberg's first name as Whoppy, not Whoopi when you ask with the exact phrase I used. The sets, props and costumes were impressive and very detail-oriented for the era. The cinematography and score were spot-on. Sadly though, it wasn't as engaging or suspenseful as I expected, as everything is told in too a-matter-of-factly way. Still a decent one-time watch, especially for Danielle Deadwyler's heart-wrenching performance.",/review/rw8695238/?ref_=tt_urv

","I wasn't fully immersed in it, like I could tell I was watching a movie, it didn't make me feel like I was part of it or lost in the story. Pretty slow, especially first part of the movie.

2 November 2022,kevin_robbins,8," A worthwhile storyline about the legendary Mamie Till-Mobley
","Till (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theatres last night. The storyline follows a mother in the mid 1950s who lives with her son after her husband passed away in World War II. She is originally from Mississippi and believes it's important for her son to spend time with family and learn where he came from. She warns him things are different in the south before he goes but a few remarks to the wrong person after he gets there, and the boy ends up missing and eventually brutally murdered. The story follows how the mother manages the loss of her son and seeks justice....",/review/rw8695238/?ref_=tt_urv

Although there were no witnesses, he spoke to 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant. Not long after, Till was abducted at gunpoint.

22 November 2022,opgdak,5," Stellar performance from Deadwyler, albeit an ephemeral depiction of a well known historical event
","Chukwu's ""Till"" is the cinematic representation of the tragic and vile murder of Emmett Till in 1955. Prior to this October 2022 biopic, in late January of 2022, ABC released a six hour, six-part, limited series on the Emmett Till story titled ""Women of the Movement"". Arguably, it can be stated that the series is an immersive, comprehensive, and harrowing portrayal of the individuals, environment, and injustice that befell Emmett, his mother Mamie, Emmett's family, and an entire African American community. Albeit a strong and emotional performance from Danielle Deadwyler, the tonality and expression of Chukwu's film is very different from the ABC series, and is largely executed in the style of a theater production with scenes acted out in a manner that reflects actors delivering their scenes in a controlled and timed fashion without emotional and realistic spontaneity. For instance, the scene of Mamie fainting on the ground upon hearing that her child had been found murdered, played out like an on-stage performance with the support cast gathering around and reacting as a diorama scene without active realism to the event. Another instance of diorama scene configuration can immediately be seen in the following sequence of shots, where a camera is pulled on a dolly slider through two different households (one white and one black), in addition to Mamie's home, as they react to the televised and radio news of Emmett Till's murder.",/review/rw8695238/?ref_=tt_urv

","Historically, when the name 'Till' is cited, it generally refers only to Emmett, the 14 year old boy who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955. Chinonye Chukwu's TILL seeks to have audiences also respect the memory of Emmett's proud mother, Mame Till-Mobley.",/review/rw8695238/?ref_=tt_urv

","I believe most of us know the tragedy of Emmett Till (Jalyn Hall) who was called ""Bo"" or even ""Bo-Bo"" for much of the film. His mother (Danielle Deadwyler) warns him on how to behave while in Mississippi, warnings which the fourteen year old ignored. The scene in the store and his encounter with Carolyn Bryant (Haley Bennett) appears to be the most accurate and reliable information available as one person is dead and the other doesn't recall everything but did claim she lied on the stand. Emmett's father was described as a hero in WWII who died in the war. They were divorced after he cheated on her. Later when he choked her to unconsciousness he was given an opportunity to avoid jail by enlisting. In Italy he did die. He was executed for the murder of one woman and the rape of two others. The actor looked almost exactly like Till, although Till had a stutter from the polio he had contracted as a child. Mamie knew the power of viewing Emmett's body all beaten which we do see in the film, looking a little like ""Elephant Man."" I thought it was a bit creepy when the mother claimed she had put her hands on every inch of her son's body.",/review/rw8695238/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2022,brentsbulletinboard,9," An Important Film
","Rarely does a film come along that captures and fuses feelings of outrage and heartache as effectively as ""Till does."" Writer-director Chinonye Chukwu's third feature outing breaks things wide open in her compelling take on the tragedy of African-American Chicago teenager Emmett Till, who was lynched and brutally murdered while visiting relatives in Mississippi in 1955 for whistling at a White woman. This fact-based offering vividly depicts the brutality and injustice of what happened (faint of heart viewers be warned) while simultaneously chronicling the efforts of Till's courageous mother, Mamie, to protect and champion the civil rights of minorities. As one of the seminal moments in the struggle to protect those who were most vulnerable at a time when many in society were content to otherwise look the other way, this release shows how a fiercely loving and devoted mother forced the complacent to see what was really happening - and creating a grass roots groundswell for change in the process. The film gets just about everything right (save for a musical score that doesn't quite seem to align with the subject matter), including in the superb period piece production values, writing that fittingly captures the mood and themes of this story, and, most notably, the performances, particularly those of Oscar contender Danielle Deadwyler, Jalyn Hall, Whoopi Goldberg and other cast members. This is a truly important film, one that genuinely lives up to all of its billing and as one of the best offerings of 2022. By all means, please see this one.",/review/rw8695238/?ref_=tt_urv

The movie captures reasonably accurately and precisely what occurred, and does an honorable job of capturing and conveyed this horrific episode in history. What happened to Emmitt Till in 1955 in Mississippi has haunted me for years and years... It was and is very important to make this very well known to persons across the country and the world, including in the form of this greatly-done movie.

8 December 2022,mossgrymk,6," till
","The most redundant line in the movie, by far, was the dedication, at the end, to the memory of the title character's mother. I mean the film should have been called ""Saint Mamie"" since the pedestal upon which the heroine is placed by director Chinonye Chukwu is of the size and height usually reserved for beatification and John Ford women. As for the rest of the characters they fall into two, well demarcated camps. The African Americans are all placed on lesser pedestals while the Caucasians are, without a single exception, depicted as vile, racist, sneering, Coke swilling scumbags. And so we leave the world of good vs evil for the Hollywood world of good vs evil caricature. And we are the lesser for it. Give it a C plus (mostly for Danielle Deadwyler's acting skills, which are considerable and who was jobbed out of an Oscar nomination).",/review/rw8695238/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,Teresamc56-FilmQuips,6," Tragic, shocking, and predictable.
","Injustice/inhumanity to man/discrimination plot based on real events. As if a trial of white men in the American South would ever find them guilty. The film is supposed to be about how Maimie Till helped with the Civil Rights Movement. What she did by showing pictures of her dead son, was a kick in the backside for anyone with a conscience in the USA. However, much of the film just shows Maimie quietly staring off into the distance as she suffers the loss. And the ending has the traditional blurbs about the rest of her life. What would have been interesting is to skip the trial and.show what she actually did after the trial/the rest of her life. These type of movies focus too much on the reason why there was a trial and the main character's demeanour. It needed to show more of her transformation from a grieving mother to a civil rights influencer because you never actually see what convinced her. Mostly, she resists it. I hated the despicable treatment of her 14-year-old son and applaud her resolve to stand up against what was done to him, as I applaud it in current events. Unless you live in a bubble, you know about discrimination. There just should have been more in this movie about afterwards instead of focusing on the before. It would have made the movie much more powerful and show people how things can be changed instead of just showing the reason. We know the reasons. Would be nice to know the processes they used to actually changed things. Stellar acting.",/review/rw8695238/?ref_=tt_urv

","I felt compelled to write a review after reading the one star from another white reviewer. I am white myself, and I couldn't disagree with that reviewer more, Who denounced the Director for her choices and seems to think the white perspective is always the more accurate one. They completely missed the point. This wasn't a story about white racism, this was a story about the power of of a Black mother, and her ability to reach beyond her own tragedy to better the lives of Black people everywhere in this country. This was a celebration of her, as it should be. This was a powerfully executed movie in every respect, and that's all that needs to be said. Well done.",/review/rw8695238/?ref_=tt_urv
