30 September 2021,knedb,5," I enjoyed season 1 &2
","I like the premise of the show. In season 3, however, Murphy is just extremely obnoxious and stubborn. I mean she's annoying in the first 2 seasons, but in season 3 she is at a whole new level. She's so stupid to treat other people like crap when she needs their help throughout the show. It makes it very frustrating to watch at times. Other than that, the show is fun to watch.",/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2019,MiketheWhistle,8," such hate, and guess what, RENEWED for 2nd season
","Guess what, disabled people are just like everyone else. They have casual sex, drink, smoke, have messed up lives. The people saying how badly it portrays blind/disabled people, watch Daredevil.
There are also disabled people that have great lives, don't have causal sex, drink, smoke, etc. So to hate this show because it shows the former is ridiculous.
And who can't love a show with a dog??? I have to wonder what the dog, Pretzel, thinks having to be there while she has sex. Is the dog thinking, I wish it were me, or enough already???
The season 1 finale was great and brought so many points together.",/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2020,POIguy,5," Starts decent but 3rd and 4th seasons are awful
","The first season of this show had a somewhat comedic and lighthearted tone given the subject matter. It was a decent watch with a flawed protagonist, fun supporting cast, and interesting story. I thought this was a good start. Season 2 upped the stakes with an interesting story, a darker tone, and overall more mature show. I felt like the characters were learning and growing this season, and season 2 was In the Dark at its best. I really cared about the In the Dark gang and wanted them to succeed in taking down Nia Bailey. Ideally, the show would have stopped at season 2 with the ending being with Nia Bailey's death and the gang getting out of dodge.",/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2019,kirbie-34481,7," It's actually pretty decent for a CW show
","The lead character is likable, as is the rest of the cast. They're adults instead of annoying teenagers, by adults I mean in their 20's, which is refreshing for a CW show. Now that it's on Netflix it will reach a wider audience, and while I admit I gave up on it a few times while attempting to binge watch it, I always managed to come back to see what happened, and i'm Glad I did. Nothing groundbreaking here, but it's a decent mystery, with some twists, while also managing to be comedy/drama with likable characters.",/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2019,trademarcdesigns,7," Good start - hope it follows through
","I was expecting to hate this show - I wanted to hate it. I fought all my life to be treated as an equal, and then some idiot decides to portray a blind woman as a drunken, self-pitying mess who sleeps with married strangers and exploits her disability to cut the line at the drug store? Gee, thanks...",/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2021,gfarrell0,2," How to destroy a good show
",Season 1: Was very entertaining. The characters were well written and interesting. The tone was good balance.,/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2021,cdeanroane,5," Season 3 was totally not believable
",From the start this show always was on the out edge of believably. However season 3 had nothing believable in. From how easily thay crossed the border into Canada with forged papers. To Jess being kidnapped and then working in a pet store. I am not sure why the plot for this show went to topsy-turvy. However it no long a must see show for me.,/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2021,catrin5507,5," First season drew me in, 3rd is killing me.
","Yes, I got over the fact that Murphy is a horrible, no-good person. Yes, I got over the fact that half the time it's unbelievable that she is even blind. Yes, I enjoyed Season 1-mostly for Pretzel and Max.",/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2021,studiopashnada,4," Why do I keep watching this show?
","Murphy is a horrible human being. The plot is often beyond ridiculous (making a rookie police chief? Everyone falling for Murphy's b.s.?) And yet, I keep watching. I guess cuz I like Jess and other characters enough that I want to see how things turn out for them.",/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2020,mattkratz,8," Good show
","I am glad I started watching this show about a blind lady who assists in solving her friend's murder. Her character is understandably a bit flawed, but is still a good and fleshed character. I like each episode as each is good to watch.",/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2019,dgangleton-70570,10," Curious. How many negative reviews are from sighted folks?

5 April 2019,fahmida-querida,8," Surprisingly great.
",Really like this so far. Main character is likeable and it has an original plotline. Nothing like what you'd expect from CW but I like the refreshingly different outlook. Didn't have to skip any parts which I normally do when a show isn't that great. Deffo recommend checking this out!,/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2020,tb4now,2," Main Character is soooo annoying
","I really tried to like this show, but the main character is soooo annoying. She is rude, self centered, and inconsiderate...and yet everyone goes out of their way for her. And still, she is a jerk to them all.",/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2019,boggie4758,5," pretty but not likeable
","I have watched 5 episodes and was hoping the main character would began to grow on me but no such luck. The story line is good and the show being about a blind girl trying to solve her friends murder is good but, they made the main character so unlikable. I think she is such a snot that it gets in the way of good story telling. I gave it the 5 episode smell test and nope it still kind of stinks. I am not going to invest any more of my time on this one. Murphy is pretty but I don't like her.",/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2020,Reds123321,1," Utter annoyance!
","Ok I watched the first season and I powered through it as I like to think whatever I started,I will finish it.So the second season has started and to dismay,its still crap.Story line i can handle but the lead character really gets under my skin,crap acting.I can safely say,even under lockdown and I've watched a lot of movies,tv shows etc,this garbage will not get anymore of my attention.",/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2019,AdrienneGrayceMusic,10," Glad i gave it a chance
","It took me awhile to start watching this show but so glad I did. I think its the most undiscovered and underrated show. Glad its finally on netflix for more people to discover. The show is very intreguing and different. Excellent casting and storyline. Its got comedy, drama a a tad bit of suspense. A great mixture. Great show, highly recommended.",/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2020,douglaswsmith,7," Just now catching onto this show...
","While it's a good cast that works well together, Murphy is a bit all over the place; can't stand Dean; Jess is likable but let's face the cold hard facts...Pretzel is the real star of the show!!!",/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2019,chetmax,9," Lots of potential
",This show has a lot of potential. The character development is starting out well. After the first episode I want to know what happened and look forward the journey with these people. I don't understand the bad reviews. It's a crime story with a different twist. Try it.,/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2020,fciocca,7," Entertaining, a show with an unusual main character
","I discovered the trailer of ""In the Dark"" on YouTube randomly and it hooked me immediately. I watched the first season in just a couple of weeks, and I was hooked since episode one.",/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2019,Obkenoby,9," It's strength is that it shows weakness
","In the pilot, the main character is a drunk sex addict. It shows her as a real person and tries to delve into why she is rough and not willing to let others get close to her, including her roommate and family. Other reviewers get offended that they dare show her like this, as an addict. They say it's a bad representation of blind people. But she's not meant to be all blind people, she's meant to be her. Why does any disabled person on television have to be a shining example for all people with that disability? Answer: they don't. There are many blind people in the real world that aren't always polite and I'm sure most of them are tired of people asking why they're blind. The show goes to extremes trying to give viewers a glimpse into the life of a blind person without sugar coating it with a world of encouragement and trying so hard. It starts off well letting you know the blind character is a real person and not just included in the show for the sake of inclusion. It lets you know the character sees herself as excluded. The start of the series has a lot of potential specifically because it shows people aren't all perfect, that being blind isn't the only flaw blind people can have, and it shows a desire for change. That's the start of a good story. Identify how things actually are, identify how the character wants to change and how they will try to change. No she's not the Wonder Woman of blind people, but she is not supposed to be either. This isn't a buddy-buddy sitcom, or a teen romance, it's a dark drama.",/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2021,vivdancing,5," Great Season 1 and 2 ! Dish Season 3!
","Season 1 was great and unpredictable. Season 2 was full of action. But goodness, could season 3 have sucked more? Stupid boring plot, unnecessary hook ups and although Murphy is not the most likable character by the time you get to 3 she is the most hated, manipulative and narcissistic blind person I've ever seen who treats her friends like crap to get what she wants. I couldn't stand her. It ended with the possibility of a season 4 but I'm done watching. The show had so much potential but season 3 ruined it for me.",/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2020,Snikic,4," By Season 2 it's so irritatingly unwatchable
","This show is absolutely maddening. There's plenty about it that, for a network/cable TV show, is compelling enough to want to keep watching... but there's so many increasingly terrible plot points that you end up clawing your own eyes out, ironically, ending up needing your own seeing eye dog. By season 2, you could make a drinking game out of how often you uncontrollably blurt out a ""UGH"", ""oh come on!"", or ""why don't u just...?!""",/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,ben-mason10,1," Disgusting

5 April 2019,lvvvlylisa,8," Only saw the Pilot so far
","Good Lord! What idiot would think that this depicts ALL blind people as alcoholics, desperate and willing to crawl into bed with anyone? Ugh. In the same vein, I guess Elementary depicts ALL private detectives as narcissists, users of women and yes...alcoholics.",/review/rw4763921/?ref_=tt_urv
