","A fantastic cast of very strong performers cannot salvage the heavy-handed script. There's a constant feeling of ""where have I heard this before"" as the dialogue advances and reveals itself as formulaic and disappointingly contrived.",/review/rw6126074/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ok so I watched the whole series in one day. I thought it was excellent.
Dark and dingy with some funny moments.
Hermione Corfield is incredible.
I've never seen her before so knew nothing about her but she was really strong as the main protagonist.
Eve Myles is a good as ever as the tainted detective trying to catch the young Corfield.
The whole cast here does a sterling job and I was sorry when it ended.
I could have watched a lot more.
Hopefully there will be a second season .",/review/rw6126074/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2021,nogodnomasters,8," A burning Desire to be loved
","I watched season 1. The story centers of Frederica (Hermione Corfield) who works in the sex industry doing mostly phone sex and apparently some escorts. She is very manipulative and vengeful. She draws in Baba (Dipo Ola ) into her world, an African immigrant with a deadly past he is attempting to leave behind. Together they kill one of her clients. An odd couple of detectives are hunting for the killer. Lola (Eve Myles ) who has a past and issues and Mendy (Babou Ceesay ) who lives his philosophy.",/review/rw6126074/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2022,bosporan,8," Premium psychodrama
","A fabulously refreshing series with a wonderful blend of humour with a sinister brooding atmosphere. The story is entertaining, snaking its way across the landscape in a dangerous game of catch-me-if-you-can.",/review/rw6126074/?ref_=tt_urv

2 June 2020,Headturner1,7," pretty good
",To the reviewer who says if your acquainted with British series you won't like this pfft. I watch mainly all UK series and watched 2 episodes last night ( that's all I could get) and thought it was pretty good. I watched 1 episode of whitechapl ater and fell asleep. Also it took me forever to go back to Broadchurch after 2 episodes and boy was I glad I did. it's only few episodes in and I go agree they gave it all away right away so hopefully there' some twist in it all but I'll definitely continue and was upset I could only watch 2 episodes.,/review/rw6126074/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2020,belleeyesbrown,10," Original Story and Great Characters....
","I absolutely loved this; I thought that it might end up being something without substance and simply geared towards being a light-hearted/crime caper....but it is so much more than that.
All the main characters are definitely either likeable or ""iffy"" as they all portray both the best and worst sides....in other words ""human""...but of course Freddy is portraying the very worst while Jackson is the complete opposite in his ever-optimistic outlook; leaving Lola and Baba as the in-betweeners of a mix of problematic personal issues creating who they are unwillingly allowing to intrude on the better side of themselves.
I found the entire 6 episodes really watchable enough to hope there will be more......and the very moment this series ""had me"" was in the ""Something's Gotta Hold of My Heart"" song then taken over with the strains of the late,wonderful Gene Pitney.
An original series with great actors known and upcoming,both thrilling and humorous by turns this,for me is an absolute hit and I recommend to anyone looking for something different yet satisfying....you'll just adore Jackson and feel for Lola and Baba.
Freddy..(Fredrika)?....well....she's on another Planet,that one...and a dangerous one at that!",/review/rw6126074/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2020,robertemerald,10," Brilliant!
","All through watching the first season of We Hunt Together I kept thinking. .. this is just as good as Killing Eve. Indeed, the leads from each series, of a powerful, calculating young woman in each case, must surely have occurred to others. Fantastic casting, acting, script, characters, movement, tension, editing. .. the whole nine yards! This was perfect late night viewing for me.",/review/rw6126074/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2020,rebecca_shaw7,9," Different, entertaining, modern!
","I binged watched all of this and really enjoyed it. It was different from the norm, had a serious subject matter yet managed to have light hearted bits and was really entertaining. Loved the characters too, fingers crossed for another series!",/review/rw6126074/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2020,grt-76906,10," Darkly absorbing, sleek and clever
",Cleverly constructed with excellent acting from all four leads. Eve Myles is amazing as one half of an unlikely detective partnership. Refreshingly flawed characters throughout develop steadily through the six episodes and twists are a plenty. The music chosen was a great bonus. Praying for a second series. Genuinely worth a watch.,/review/rw6126074/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2022,Pairic,8," Quirky Killers
","We Hunt Together: Quirky series about two killers, their backgrounds are explored and this provides some answers as to why they have evolved into the monsters that they are. It's difficult to feel sympathy for some of their victims but this is leavened with the killing of innocent bystanders. Two troubled detectives pursue the death-dealing duo. No cardboard characters in this engaging drama. Season 2 starts Thursday 5 May on Alibi. 8/10.",/review/rw6126074/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2020,marktootill,9," Nice character mix
","Well acted from everyone, and a lot to think about with characters that are far from ""normal""
Mainly dark moments with a little bit of humour thrown in - great cast - well worth watching.",/review/rw6126074/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2022,popsalicious,8," Entertaining, funny, great story
","Honestly, you can very rarely go wrong with a UK crime series. They just do everything right, stories have a lot of twists and turns. This one at least has some great humor nestled in between the serious investigation, which sets it above all the rest.",/review/rw6126074/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2020,oscarhoop,5," Had potential.

26 October 2020,simonwoodwrites,6," Nice Performances Hides The Weaknesses
","I'm not sure how I feel about this series. I liked it but it did irk me too. Some nice performances which hide the story weaknesses. There were too many plotting conveniences, logic problems, plot holes and poor procedural research in the latter episodes. I think it's a mistake to carry on with Freddy's story. It'll be too much like Killing Eve.",/review/rw6126074/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2021,freddy_at_home,4," Boring! Nothing new here
","I thought it was boring. The new black partner she got, was nagging and annoying and just made it all crap. Seen it before, nothing new and it's quite boring stuff. Not worth spending many hours on.",/review/rw6126074/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2022,nancyldraper,8," Compelling
","To date, there have been two seasons released of this series. They have left it open for another season, but there is no word yet. (Open, but not a cliffhanger.) The acting is superb. Eve Myles playing cranky against Babou Ceesay's perpetual optimism makes a great investigative pairing, while Hermione Corfield's performed psychopathy and Dipo Ola's convincing search for redemption shifts our moral compass. There is a dark lightness at play here, that, at first, I found dissonant, but soon became an integral rhythm of the story. The cast is wonderful, the story is darkly captivating, the series is compelling, I give this series an 8 (compelling) out of 10, {Crime Drama}",/review/rw6126074/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2021,westsideschl,6," Let's Hunt Some More
","In detective series the norm seems to be having interdepartmental issues with the usual one detective a bit odd; the other no-nonsense-practical, and, of course, the overbearing dept. Head. You would think writers could come up with something a bit more plot creative in that regard. Another cheap detective series tool is just showing a body for a minute after the deed has been done. No expense in having long drawn out emotionally traumatic killing scenes.",/review/rw6126074/?ref_=tt_urv

26 September 2020,seanrcousins,1," Forget it
","Terrible series and ordinary acting, especially by the female lead. Totally unbelievable, and implausible plot. The stupidity of the show highlighted by Freddys miraculous recovery from being shot. The end implies they'll be another series. There won't be! Very annoyed with myself that I wasted 6hrs of my life.",/review/rw6126074/?ref_=tt_urv
