4 September 2005,jotix100,7," The numbers racket
","""Hoodlum"" is a film that deserved much better. Bill Duke, its talented director, gives us a picture of what the Harlem of the thirties was like. In fact, ""Hoodlum"" suffers when it's compared to Coppola's ""The Cotton Club"". Mr. Duke, an actor himself, was able to amass a great cast and he got performances that are amazing from this first rate ensemble.",/review/rw2680139/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2015,Hey_Sweden,7," An entertaining gangster picture with a great cast.
","Overlong but riveting, highly visceral mob movie with a difference, as it shows the rise to prominence of ""Bumpy"" Johnson (Laurence Fishburne). Johnson, fresh from a stint in prison, goes to work for successful Harlem numbers racketeer Stephanie St. Clair (Cicely Tyson), then takes over the operation when she is sent to prison. His approach, unsurprisingly, is much different and more proactive than hers, which comes in handy when they are forced to deal with the activities of Arthur Flegenheimer, a.k.a. ""Dutch Schultz"" (Tim Roth), a pathologically greedy, flamboyantly nasty creep just full of swagger.",/review/rw2680139/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2003,dynamicresolve,8," A great film, victim to negative people
","It seems to me like in today's film world, critics, whether it be Ebert or the viewers, are quick to down a film if it has a large budget.  I think Hoodlum fell victim to this epidemic.  With a bankroll of wonderful actors and actresses, and some of the best historical recreation of the locations, the movie delivers. The plot was simple, but it doesn't need to be complicated in a gangster flick like this.  It was based on real people, so the creators of the film cannot go ballistic on changing the story.  Maybe the 'critics' would like it better if it had a little green man who uses the force, or maybe a future crime prevention device.  Well, you won't find this here.  It's a wonderful, semi-true story about the way things were in Harlem and the surroundings areas back then.  Fishburn turned in a wonderful performance, and Roth played a great villian as he always does.  Just relax, and take it for what it's meant to be.  Entertainment.",/review/rw2680139/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2009,zardoz-13,7," A Lavishly Mounted But Uneven Black Gangster Epic With a Superior Cast
","Snap-brim fedoras, vintage autos, blazing Tommy guns, corrupt public officials and greedy mobsters battling it out over turf rights recur throughout director Bill Duke's violent, 1930s' racketeering epic ""Hoodlum,"" a pictorially authentic actioneer that evokes memories of the classic Robert Stack television series ""The Untouchables."" Although ""Hoodlum"" boasts a top-drawer cast, including Laurence Fishburne, Vanessa Williams, Tim Roth, and Andy Garcia, this lavishly mounted but uneven gangster saga suffers from its rambling length, garrulous script and a shortage of shoot-outs. As the first major film to headline the crimes of Harlem's infamous Black Godfather Ellsworth 'Bumpy' Johnson, this production offers a novel departure for audiences that are weary of superheroes, female warriors and hard-bitten cops who have were crowding the big-screen when ""Hoodlum"" appeared in 1997.",/review/rw2680139/?ref_=tt_urv

","`Harlem 1934.  In a world impoverished by the great depression, the single largest business in Harlem is an illegal lottery known as the `numbers'. For many, a winning numbers slip is the only chance to put food on the table.  The undisputed leader of the Harlem numbers is Madame Queen, who has run this multi-million dollar business quietly and peacefully for over a decade.  Notorious gangster Dutch Schultz has defied the wishes of his partner, crime chief Charles `Lucky' Luciano and decided it's time to share in the profits.

","Riveting film about gang wars and race relations in 1930s New York, with Ellsworth ""Bumpy"" Johnson (Laurence Fishburne) at the center. Engaging characters and situations make this overlong movie watchable; but Andy Garcia doesn't channel Luciano as well as he should, and Tim Roth turns Dutch Schultz into such a blatant stock villain that one wonders what the real Arthur Fleggenheimer was like. Otherwise, excellent performances all around - and Paul Benjamin steals several scenes as a creepy assassin who talks as if he eats tobacco leaves for breakfast.

22 May 2003,allar100,5," A waste of good talent
","This film had a lot of talent in it, but it just wasn't very good.  It seems like it was a throwback of some of the old blaxploitation films.  But I am not sure if they were trying to do that, or if it just came out that way. Anyway, a flat drawn out story, and choppy direction didn't help this movie in the least bit.  Even that action scenes weren't very good.  See it if you must, but you really aren't missing anything.",/review/rw2680139/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hoodlum.....what can I say, if you had cool Grandparents that grew up in Harlem in the 1930's who liked to party, dress and play numbers then maybe you'd of heard some of the stories about the going ons in Harlem U.S.A. during that period. Numbers were literally the Black mans lottery back then and communication between runner and player no matter how small the amount played was the lug that connected dreams with hope for the little guy; Hoodlum is a story about the preservation of those hopes and dreams by a one Bumpy Johnson. The music, wardrobe and cinematography is superb, I highly recommend this tale of Harlem history.",/review/rw2680139/?ref_=tt_urv

","Bill Duke directs this highly fictionalized tale about 1930's gangsters Dutch Schultz(Tim Roth)and Lucky Luciano(Andy Garcia)trying to take over the ""numbers"" business in Harlem. There is one big problem...Bumpy Johnson(Laurence Fishburne). When the story line goes a little flat; out comes the switch blades and tommy guns. The violence really doesn't take up that much screen time, but when it does it is ruthless and savage.

4 March 2008,shadowman123,8," Might feel unrealistic but is big on entertainment
","Hoodlum is the story black a black underclass gangster who stands toe-to-toe with the Italian and Jewish Mafia in Harlem during 1930's in the great depression era. I checked out the story from watching the movie on Sunday and what I can say that yes there were several factual occurrences that took place during that time, however Hoodlum ends up turning its-self into some sort action flick rather than a factual account of what really happened, having said that it is still a very entertaining movie to watch and has some good performances as well as well made action scenes. Laurence Fishburne was excellent as the charming, and wise Bumpy Johnson who shows us an educated black man not afraid to stand up for what he believes in, Tim Roth was excellent as the unstable Ducth Schultz although I found my-self comparing him to Joe Pesci at times , and Andy Garcia as Lucy Lucoina was good with his screen time however I felt the stand out performance was Cicley Tyson who portrayed a very strong, elegant , proud Black woman. The movie rolled on fast and got into the swing straight away , there was good use of make-up , wardrobe and scenery which gave us a feel of 1930's Harlem. The interaction between characters is good as it gives us a real feel of what life was like back then. However the problems with Hoodlum are that the script seems a little superficial and characters which can have real depth to them normal end up being well quite flat. The film was supposed to be about real life events but it just seems to way to far fetched to the point where it does feel like a no brain action movie and the action it-self seems to be tit-for-tat repetitive although Fishburane's performance keeps you guessing how will he strike back and thusly the second half of the movie just feels messy and rushed. To conclude Hoodlum is probably not one of the best gangster movies about the black era to come I mean it is over shadowed by the likes of American Gangster but it does however manage to entertain on a big scale and is not a waste of time , its just a shame with a few clear faults in it however I would recommend as a rental and worth a check out for fans of the gangster genre.",/review/rw2680139/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2002,esteban1747,7," Fight of gangsters in Harlem
","This is probably one of the best gangster films, where an adapted real story is shown. Andy Garcia is the famous maffia boss Lucky Luciano and Tim Roth is the sharky Dutch Schultz, they both acted very well. Roth knows well how to be a real villain and Andy is a master in roles of cynic persons, but the best acting belongs to Larry Fishburne as a maffia black boss Bumpy Johnson. The film shows how the groups led by Schultz and Johnson fought for the control of different areas of New York City including Harlem, to what extent local police and politic people were involved in favoring one or another group. Bill Duke should be proud of directing such a quality film, which unfortunately has received modest attention from the critics.",/review/rw2680139/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2000,coop-16,8," Good film; sadly distorted history
","This is , on the whole a very good, if mostly unoriginal period gangster film.The performances are solid, if unspectacular, the direction is assured and sometimes innovative, with some clever original touches and one or two nice ""hommages"" to Scorsese, Coppola, and the the thirties  classics of Wellman et.al. The biggest problem with the film is the utterly ludicrous portrayal of Tom Dewey. Dewey was arrogant, cold, and self-righteous; he was not corrupt.Indeed, he was  the second best district attorney in America during the thirties ( Earl Warren, in Oakland, California was the best)and one of the best state Governors in American history. Once again, if you are a Republican and a W.A.S.P, you can be accused of anything.",/review/rw2680139/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2003,icsisrain,9," Underrated Gangster Film !
","I think that Hoodlum is a great gangster film and is extremely underrated. I think that this movie can definitely hang up there with all the other movies that get praise for being good crime dramas. What I like about the film is the way it really portrays the actual characters in real life. Lawrence Fishburne and Tim Roth give great performances that really bring this movie alive. Also, Andy Garcia does a good job portraying Lucky Luciano. I think that this movie had all the elements of a good movie but it just got shafted a little. I'm not saying it's Goodfellas, but if you like that movie then there is no reason why you would not like this one. I love the story behind this movie and the subplot of his relationship with Vanessa Williams. and I must admit that I do like this movie because I love crime family dramas and it is nice to see one with black people starring in it showing what part they played in that world  back in that time frame. I would suggest to anyone who likes gangster and mafia movies to go see this one. If you want to learn about the history of organized crime back in the 20's and 30's then this is a great way to get a feel for that time! This movie gets nothing but rave reviews from me :)",/review/rw2680139/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hoodlum (1997): Dir: Bill Duke / Cast: Laurence Fishburne, Tim Roth, Andy Garcia, Vanessa Williams, Cicely Tyson: Well made gangster film that evaporates into a litter of bullets. It regards lower standards of living and hostile attitude. Based on a true story in the 1930's Harlem with a triangle turf battle in motion. Laurence Fishburne leads the patrol against Tim Roth and Andy Garcia. He is smart and tough but unable to balance his personal life with romance. Bodies pile up and nobody really wins in the end. The concept still holds interest although the screenplay grows repetitious and weary. Director Bill Duke does a fine job with fantastic art direction. This film successfully captures the period for which it addresses but perhaps a tighter screenplay would have been beneficial. Fishburne holds his own as a gangster trying to be the gangster and the romantic interest. This will not work to his favour. Vanessa Williams delivers a strong performance as his love interest who is questioning the lifestyle he is involved in. Roth and Garcia overact as the two other opposing gang leaders who will end up on the receiving end of bad luck. This is not terrible filmmaking but the screenplay isn't as ambitious as it could have been. It does succeed in present the period for which it represents. Its purpose is to create the reality of gang lifestyles but the screenplay has more bark than bite. Score: 6 / 10",/review/rw2680139/?ref_=tt_urv
