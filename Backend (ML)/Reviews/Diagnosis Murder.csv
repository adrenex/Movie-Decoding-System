31 May 2016,CineMuseFilms,," a horror movie with more originality than usual
","If you are looking for a horror movie with more originality than usual this may be your film. Most horrors are standard genre films that rely on cinema clichés to frighten us and audiences have become immune to plots with spooky dolls, isolated nannies and scary mansions. The Boy (2016) stands out by combining all of these horror tropes into a single story then overlays them with a plausible thriller about parental grief. It tries to be a serious film without the lame humour which so often sugar-coats horror movies into comedy-thrillers. But the downside is also typical of the genre: it runs out of ideas on how to finish the job.",/review/rw3402451/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2019,BandSAboutMovies,8," Stay with this!
","There's a moment early on in The Boy where you're either going to think it's the dumbest movie you've ever seen or completely brilliant. I err on the side of the latter, loving the audaciousness that demands that you believe that a porcelain doll could be alive. Director William Brent Bell brings you along for a great ride, keeping you wondering until the end who is really crazy here.",/review/rw3402451/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2016,annaily,7," The bad reviews have it all wrong
","This movie was a great CREEPY movie. Not intensely terrifying, and that was not the purpose. Dolls are creepy and therefore a movie about a doll is supposed to be creepy and this movie nailed it. A lot of people complain about the ending, some say that they don't like how it wasn't actually the doll being possessed by a spirit, and I've even read some reviews from some.... Not very smart people.... Who somehow totally missed the fact that the man was the ""dead"" boy. He killed a little girl when he was 8. His parents were ashamed, hid him in the walls, and I believe they created doll to replace their ""odd"" boy. They locked the real guy up, never saw him, fed him through the walls, he had a bunch of holes he made over time that led to the inside of the house. The parents were scared of him too, so they made sure to comply with all his requests: loud music so he can hear it behind the walls. Living in isolation for 20 years behind the walls would obviously drive someone intensely mad, not to mention he was odd to start out with. Obsessive, creepy, weird. The doll was his creepy way of being loved and accepted by his parents, and as he hoped, by a woman. So he lived through the doll for 20 years. It's the story of an isolated family with a dark secret, an even more isolated and insane man who just wanted to be loved, and lived through the more lovable and accepted doll, and was murderous against anyone who rejected him. Creepy. And successful. Anyone who dislikes this movie probably wanted super scary, and it did have a couple scary moments, or they wanted poltergeist chuckie demon doll, which no offense, but that is silly. It makes it way more cool for it to not be paranormal but just a really f'ed up family in the middle of nowhere.",/review/rw3402451/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2016,tlooknbill,9," Odd, suspenseful, creepy and a bit disturbing, but thoroughly entertaining.
","I give it an 9 stars because the end kind of sets it up for a sequel, but hey, the rest of ""The Boy"" is beautifully stylized and paced similar to the spooky, suspenseful and disturbing '60's British made thrillers like Betty Davis' ""The Nanny""and Debra Kerr's ""The Innocents"" only with an added surprise ending and faster pace.",/review/rw3402451/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2016,dave-mcclain,9," ""The Boy"" is an original and entertaining horror thriller.
","When you're crazy, do you know you're crazy? It's a question I've heard asked in movies and in real life, but it is quite the poser (at least for those of us who are not crazy as far as we know). In other words, when you're doing things that other people would call ""crazy"", at what point do you move from ""eccentric"", or even ""weird"", to genuinely, certifiably using the clinical term ""bat-sh** crazy""? These are some of the questions you'll be asking about more than one character in the horror thriller ""The Boy"" (PG-13, 1:37). But you'll soon find out that insanity is only one possible explanation for the unusual behavior of various characters and the many strange happenings throughout this very entertaining film.",/review/rw3402451/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2016,Leofwine_draca,6," Creepy doll movie is pretty effective at what it does
","THE BOY is another example of the creepy/subtle/old-fashioned 'ghost story' genre that is now back in vogue with the likes of THE CONJURING, SINISTER, and the INSIDIOUS movies. These go back-to-basics in their approach, eschewing gore effects for more old-fashioned jump scares and general foreboding and creepiness. I find them slightly overrated - the older classics of the genre such as THE UNINVITED and THE HAUNTING are by default much better - but THE BOY is one of the better ones of recent years.",/review/rw3402451/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2016,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,6," Highly entertaining but fundamentally uneven and flawed, ""The Boy"" is a mish-mash of ideas that are fun to watch, but don't quite come together...
","You ever watch a film, and at a certain point, you get the feeling that the final product is obviously a heavily edited (if not outright- butchered) re-working and simplification of an otherwise great idea? Like a studio-suit-type got their hands on a really cool and original script that defied convention... but then that same studio- suit got cold feet, and had a legion of ghost- writers re-work it into something more generic and ""audience friendly""?",/review/rw3402451/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2016,nitzanhavoc,7," Not what you might think it to be - for better or for worse.
","It is somewhat difficult for me to explain my viewing experience of this film, and in no way do I mean to sound condescending of uppity, so kindly bear with me... Usually, after years of ""experience"" with a certain hobby, one is able to differentiate objective criticism from lack of personal satisfaction. For me, The Boy is a perfect example, so I'll make sure to separate my personal opinions from what I perceive to be the makings of a fine Horror film.",/review/rw3402451/?ref_=tt_urv

13 May 2016,riceryan,8," Really not as bad as some as these reviews are making it out to be.
","I'm an avid IMDb user. This is actually my first time writing a review though. I felt inclined after browsing through other's reviews saying how horrible this movie was. It was actually a lot better than I expected. I wasn't in a huge hurry to see it, but I'm happy I watched it. I haven't been a fan of many newer horror movies with the exception of It Follows, but I recommend watching this with an open mind. There's a twist that makes it worth while and I must admit, I didn't see it coming a mile away. Perfect ending to my mini Friday the 13th marathon. -- -- -- -- ----- ----- -----—------------ -----—------—----------------------------- ---",/review/rw3402451/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2016,kristofen,9," Not Your Typical Thriller
","Let's face it, dolls and poltergeists have been overdone in the past decades. It's always the same plot. However, it has NEVER been done like this. At first, it was a bit predictable. Nanny comes in, encounters creepy family, goes with the flow, experiences some disturbing shizz, still goes with the flow because continuity. There were some jumps that were nicely executed and it certainly kept the viewer interested. But movies like this usually head in one direction... This one, on the other hand, brought in something refreshing. I can honestly say I never saw the twist coming. There were very subtle hints, if any. Overall, it was above average yet unnerving. It wins a few points on creativity, so it's a 7.5. Rated it 9 to balance the score and encourage new opinions.",/review/rw3402451/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2016,Quinoa1984,5," quite possibly the most absurd twist that I've ever come across

3 February 2016,eabra48463,6," Entertaining but Definitely Flawed
","""The Boy"" presents us with an interesting premise from the start. A young American woman takes a job as a nanny to an elderly couple's child in Britain. Only when she gets to their large, creepy mansion does she learn the ""boy"" is really a doll that the couple treats as if it is alive and their son. Much of what ensues after this is fairly predictable. We know the doll is going to end up doing creepy things, or at least we'll be led to believe this is the case. We also know there will be something more going on than what meets the eye. Lauren Cohan does a very good job, which is essential because she has to carry most of the movie. Many scenes are with her and the doll alone. Also, the setting and the doll itself do a great job of creating the mood. The film does well at holding the viewer's attention; however, once we see the final ""twist"" we understand that it was really the only reasonable explanation--although it is really not all that reasonable. There are a few scenes where the dialog and impact fall a little flat. I recommend the film to those who really like this genre, because there is enough there to make it worthwhile; however, do not expect a masterpiece.",/review/rw3402451/?ref_=tt_urv
