","Appreciate this film for what it is: fun, mindless, action-filled entertainment. No need to dissect, analyse or compare this. My only few complaints are that the writing was too loose and should have been edited down by 15-20 mins to keep the pace more elevated throughout. Also, not a fan of the Energyne CEO sister and brother characters - they were way too cheesy and annoying and cheapened the film. All other actors were cast and performed great, and Dwayne entertained as always. The SFX/VFX were also great. A fun and well deserved 8/10 from me",/review/rw4127491/?ref_=tt_urv

8 July 2018,claudio_carvalho,6," Brainless Entertainment
","""Rampage"" is one of those brainless entertainments full of clich√©s, plot holes and corny and terrible storyline. But if you have nothing to do and wants to spend your leisure time having fun and eating popcorns, ""Rampage"" is recommended. The viewer will see the hot Malin Akerman, will recall Negan and will laugh with a white King Kong replica destroying a monster not affected by four missiles on its head with a steel bar through its eye. My vote is six.",/review/rw4127491/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2018,nogodnomasters,8," I have been to Uganda and Hogswart.
","Dwayne Johnson teams up with Naomie Harris to save Chicago from giant, bullet resistant ape, wolf, and gator. We get the King Kong climb the building flashback as well as King Kong vs Godzilla. The film is made with kids or tweens in mind. Dwayne Johnson provides us with the same strong and humorous character we have come to known, but make no mistake, the George, the ape, had the best laughs with his sign language. Jeffrey Dean Morgan gave us a likable spook. Very cliche film. The CG was good. In the initial outer space scene, I appreciated that they went out of their way to create a weightless environment. So many film makers don't bother. Worth watching. Action, drama, and laughs. ",/review/rw4127491/?ref_=tt_urv

",Dwayne Johnson is the new Jackie Chan of this generation when he only need to plays himself is enough to draw a ton of people to the theater and support him show how much of a charismatic man he is.With Rampage I can say that he still in his comfort zone which is a fun popcorn movie where The Rock one again starring as a likable macho man doing incredible stuff out of normal human reach like survive a hella lot life and dead situation or fighting along side with giant monster and still come out alive.I maybe biased when it come to some of my favorite actors but if you tired of Dwayne Johnson just skip Rampage for me Skyscraper is next,/review/rw4127491/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2018,facebook-923-997082,6," Gloriously Terrible
","Every single cliche of an action/horror/adventure flick rolled up into one. The charisma of the two big guys (Dwayne and George) carry the entire movie. This movie is not going to change your life, but it will keep you mildly amused.",/review/rw4127491/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2018,stevendbeard,8," Monster Fest
","I saw ""Rampage"", starring Dwayne Johnson-Jumanji:Welcome to the Jungle, Faster; Naomie Harris-Moneypenny in the Daniel Craig Bond movies, Miami Vice_2006; Jeffrey Dean Morgan-Batman v Superman:Dawn of Justice, Watchmen and Malin Akerman-Childrens Hospital_tv, Watchmen.
This movie is based on a video game and stars Dwayne as a primatologist-a fancy name for an ape specialist-working in an animal park/zoo. Dwayne basically raises an albino gorilla-he named George-after saving him from poachers and they even talk to each other, using sign language. Malin runs a genetics company that has been doing gene splicing experimentation on rats in outer space-they figured it would be safe, away from prying government eyes that just might want to stop them. Of course, things go wrong and 3 samples of the deadly mutating pathogen comes crashing down to the earth, infecting 3 different animals, in 3 different locations. One being George and the other 2 being a wolf and a crocodile. The pathogen increases the animals' size, strength, speed and stamina to Godzilla sized proportions and they start tearing up the country. Jeffrey is a government agent that calls himself a troubleshooter for the feds and Naomie is a former employee of Malin's that thinks she knows how to stop the creatures with an antidote she had been working on. It's a pretty good old action Monster Fest. Lots of action and lots of giant monsters tearing up stuff.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, action and destruction, language and some crude gestures and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes.
I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",/review/rw4127491/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2018,Darth_Osmosis,7," Now this is some good old fashioned dumb fun!
","Inspired by the classic Arcade and later various other systems game of the same name, the movie boasts a predictably simple premise and let's just say the characters are not too complex.. yeah. But this is OK! Nobody will see this movie for compelling characters and dramatic scenes. The cast is mostly just passable, with the exception of Johnson(who always rocks!) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan who turns in one hell of an entertaining government agent, and of course George the gorilla is also one cool dude.

31 January 2019,one9eighty,6," A 'leave your brain at the door' action film
","A scientific space station testing a substance, codename Rampage, has a problem and is about to explode. The last remaining scientist attempts to save some of the test formula and eject herself with it back to Earth but things go wrong. The formula crash lands on earth in three different locations, but due to damage, the containers it's held in are broken so when unsuspecting animals inspect the crash, they get infected by Rampage. 3 animals are thus infected; a crocodile, a wolf, and a gorilla. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson plays Davis Okoye, Primatologist and ex-special forces soldier. He is the carer of George, the gorilla who gets infected. He will do everything in his power to save George, and as events of the film unfold, it becomes a race against time (and occasionally George) to stop the infected animals from rampaging Chicago and bring it to rubble. He's not alone, he's got help from disgraced Dr Kate Caldwell (Naomie Harris), who once worked for the company who developed Rampage; and from Agent Harvey Russell (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) who works for an OGA (other government agency) trying to save America from scientific disasters.",/review/rw4127491/?ref_=tt_urv

","Rampage is a healthy dose of CGI mayhem, anchored by the star power of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. What Rampage lacks in complexity and story, it makes up for through pure spectacle and fun.",/review/rw4127491/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2018,GOWBTW,9," I played the game, but this is more fun!
","I remembered playing the arcade game, ""Rampage"". You got the 3 animal characters: George the Gorilla, Ralph the Wolf, and Lizzie the Lizard. In the new 2018 action film, George is an albino gorilla. Ralph is a flying wolf, and Lizzie is a mutated alligator. Dwayne Johnson plays Davis, a primatologist who takes care of George. He communicates with George through sign-language. 
When a genetic chemical made in a space lab crash lands, George, Ralph,and Lizzie come in contact with it, and the people responsible are located in Chicago, Illinois. George is from San Diego, Ralph, the Midwest, and Lizzie is from Florida from the Gulf Coast area. 
I know that they got George right, except for the albinoism. And how did Ralph and Lizzie ended up being mutants? Ralph's flying? And Lizzie is a freak of nature. That's a little too much there. 
This movie has a bit of humor. George being very suggestive with his sign language. The action was non-stop. I enjoyed it very well. The plot was different from the game. But parts of the scenes were very close to the game. It's a keeper for me.

","16 April 2018
Second fIlm of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Rampage. When man interferes with nature, it always goes wrong, you think people would learn but why do they have to when Dwayne Johnson is there to save the day!!! Inspired by a video game I'm not familiar with, Rampage is as corny as they come, yet with monsters as gargantuan to the species as Dwayne Johnson is to his, this film somehow works. A science experiment, in the eyes of many, has gone wrong, but in the greedy money grabbing eyes of the people who are in control of the scientists, everything is right on track to make their fortune. Throw the military into the mix and you have a typical Hollywood all action disaster film. Once again Chicago bears the brunt, and it's such visual feast of varying shaped buildings, interspersed with bridges, waterways, a raised railway transit system and a huge lake next to it, it must be a movie makers delight to base it as the battlefield of all manner of horror/disaster/saving humanity stories, and I for one love seeing it used as a set for such film genres. This film will not win any best actor awards, but the special effects guys should get a look in. Moments of humour intersect all the dramatic action and it makes for a very enjoyable film.",/review/rw4127491/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2018,AnonymousMouseMan,," This is exactly what you think it is... And that's great!
","It's a Rampage movie, I'm not sure what else people are expecting walking into this movie. It's fun, filled with action and very little on working on guy/girl romance which I always thought deviated from the plot anyhow. It's full of action, adventure and very slight amount of problem solving and that's all you need from a movie like this.",/review/rw4127491/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2018,TheLittleSongbird,4," On the rampage
","Dwayne Johnson may not be the greatest of actors but he is a very likeable and charismatic guy. The advertising and concept of 'Rampage' gave the sense that there was potential for a turn-brain-off-at-the-door fun film, and the kind of film 'Rampage' was a type that has been enjoyed on a number of occasions by me regardless of its mixed to negative critical reception.",/review/rw4127491/?ref_=tt_urv

","I didn't wasn't expecting much going to see this movie but it wasn't the worst of 2018. In fact, It is what you expect it to be in terms of being. a popcorn flick. I have to say the special effects were indeed well done but the dialogue ended up being cheesy and just forced throughout the film. I did enjoy the last 20 or so minutes as it showed what most people were waiting for. Monsters destroying Chicago and each other. The movie is good in terms of being a popcorn flick but nothing else",/review/rw4127491/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2018,harryplinkett14,1," Kills brain cells
","I actually felt my brain cells dying as I watched this horribly written piece of garbage. I left about an hour into the film, unable to continue watching. It was atrocious in every way. First of all, the idea of giant beasts fighting is something we have seen so many times, it's really dull a this point. Add to that a virtually non-existing plot, insufferable characters and dialogue, and derivative action scenes that make no attempt to go beyond any of the established cliches, and you get the idea what kind film this is. But the film exhibits a further problem: it is stupid. Utterly stupid. Nothing in it makes any sense at all. Characters act in inexplicably dumb ways, and things that make no sense happen over and over again. I felt I was watching a film written by mentally challenged people. 
Avoid this film like the plague. It's not even one of those dumb but entertaining action films. It is just dumb and poorly made in virtually every respect. It will cause mental pain to watch it.",/review/rw4127491/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2018,subxerogravity,7," The Rock is cooking that cheese but I'm loving every bite
","Rampage was fun I give it that. The Rock seem to be making a ridiculous movie based on an arcade game from the 80s that he possibly loved playing after school like I did, and when the movie gets to that part where it looks exactly like the game I totally become that 12 year old boy that this movie was perfectly designed for. I mean, there's nothing that put a smile on my face more than watching Dwayne Johnson, and a Giant albino CGI ape, go up against a 30 foot wolf and a Godzilla wannabe. Only an ex-wrestler turned box office superstar could have handed you so much cheese with an extra scoop of corny and made you eat it all up with delight.",/review/rw4127491/?ref_=tt_urv
