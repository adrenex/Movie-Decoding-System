15 September 2022,paul_haakonsen,8," This is a MUST watch DC animated show...
","Right, well I only just got on the ""Harley Quinn"" express here in 2022. I knew about this animated series, but just never opted to actually sit down and watch it, as I didn't really have much of an interest in the Harley Quinn character.",/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2020,verminhater,9," Everything the Birds of Prey movie isn't.
","I write this after watching the drivel that was the Harley Quinn movie ""Birds of Prey"". Where the live action was unable to articulate a story and relied solely on Margot Robbie to carry the entire film the animation steps up and shows them how it should be done.",/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2021,alindsayal,8," A Great off the wall first season
",So in the UK the first season of the DC Animated Show Harley Quinn finished today and I have now watched all of it and here is my review for the show. The premise of the show sees a newly single Harley Quinn set off to become the biggest supervillain in all of Gotham.,/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2019,nasdagoodshepherd,9," One Hell of Cartoon from DC Comics!
","I was by far excited to watch the new adult animated series from DC Universe, Harley Quinn. I watched the first episode and it was great as hell! Harley Quinn is such a fantastic villain to be a fantastic protagonist in the series, the violence, the animation, the writing, and the humor is very amazing! And I can easily say that this show is so great to watch. Now it became one of my favorite animated DC shows since Teen Titans, Young Justice, and DC Super Hero Girls (2019). I give Harley Quinn a 9.5/10",/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2020,pogopuggie,10," Top Tier
",A fresh take on Gotham filled with flavour and fun. Every character has been given relatable human flaws and speak in conversational casual lending them so much more believability and dimension. The Ivy-Harley chemistry is natural and nothing about this show despite the occasional high fantasy shenanigan seems forced. Worked its way to my top animated shows of all time very quickly and I genuinely hope you love it too.,/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2021,jeffcour,10," This Harley is superb
","This is Harley Quinn done right. Hilarious and touching, smart, witty, sarcastic, exciting, gloriously gory, and a tremendous send-up of the whole supervillian / superhero genre. Even though these are superheroes and villains, they all have very real human flaws, and the creators have a LOT of fun making them (especially Batman, Bane and Commissioner Gordon) as ridiculous as possible. Harley and Ivy are bad villains, but they are good people. Their chemistry is electric. The Joker is at war with himself and Harley while determined to blow up the city. And the supporting cast, voiced by stellar actors, is just icing on the cake. This show is addictive and pure fun. You WILL enjoy it.",/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2020,Tweetienator,8," Harley Quinn Rocks
","I am really no fan of new DC movies and shows these days but I admit and I am happy that I can state: Harley Quinn is a lot of fun to watch. We get everything an adult needs in a good show: cursing, blood, violence, bad but good humor and some likeable villain characters and some boring cardbox superheros. All in all: a very good and entertaining animation show for adults.",/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2020,Pairic,8," Great Fun
","Harley Quinn: The animated series, very much an adult show. She spends most of the time battling The Joker and other villains rather than Batman. She hangs out with Poison Ivy and gathers together a gang of sidekicks. No one is perfect in this production, very many human failings and hang-ups. Good fun. 8/10.",/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2020,nogodnomasters,10," Not our brand of evil
","Harley breaks up with Joker and moves in with Poison Ivy. Her goal is to pull enough jobs to be recognized to be able to join The Legion Of Doom, pretty much an all-boys club. She gets a group of misfit henchmen to help her.",/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv

19 August 2022,mariamshehab,10," Clever writing. In love with the series.
","Im in love with this series. Im not even a big fan of comics, marvel ect. But I enjoyed every bit of this series. Everything is so clever, the comedy and the character development especially; and i've been enjoying season 3 the most.",/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2019,rodyvanhulst,10," A homerun
","Great animation, very funny, made for adults and great voice acting.
Every episode so far had been a blast its really refreshing to see the bounds of animated super hero series being pushed.",/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2019,hotrobinproductions,9," How the heck don't you like this???
","What's up with some low rated reviews? If you don't like it, you don't like it, but anything lower than 4 stars is just completely unnecessary. The animation is amazing. The voice acting is awesome, the show feels like a rush of adrenaline and has a very good message with a smart style that I was NOT expecting. I feel like everyone is complaining about violence and cursing... if that's too much for you then why even bother? You know what type of show this would be from trailers. Violence and swearing has been in plenty of films like Quinton Tarantino, but I don't see you guys complaining about that. Just STFU and enjoy a good show when you see one. No way does this show deserve a 1/10 very dumb opinion, and the reasons behind your guys opinion is just absurd.",/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2022,maxsullivannn,10," Far exceeded my expectations...
","I'm not even a big superhero fan, this show really impressed me. It's actually hilarious and well written. The main cast: Clayface, Harley, poison ivy, the shark, Dr. Psycho, all amazing characters. The dynamic between them all is super entertaining and sometimes I laughed out loud multiple times per episode.",/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2022,yerffej,10," A shining gem you shouldn't pass on
","The animation and writing are absolutely amazing. They do SO many things right! You can really tell the writers don't try to push too hard in one political direction and even when they do, they IMMEDIATELY counter it to remain in the center. For instance, after firing a gun, Ivy says something like ""Thank God for the 2nd Amendment... But of course I support criminal background checks."" You gotta appreciate the carefulness in this day and age not to have the show fall into tribalism. I can honestly say, even as a man, this show is an exemplar of female empowerment, and for ONCE, does it in a way that's not nauseating. Even when they get to the lesbian relationship between Harley and Ivy, they do it in a way that's not nauseatingly woke - it was beautifully done. Other shows should take note on how to address sensitive topics without pandering. Really looking forward to the next season!",/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2021,hwseayy,10," One of the best shows ever period
",The story is masterfully crafted and so beautiful. The characters are all perfect. The tone is so daring but perfectly balanced. I really wanna thank the creators like this is probably one of the best shows all together out there! I hope Harley literally never ends.,/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2019,grafikjoe,10," Now we are talking!
","Finally another good animation show for adults! Why can DC only be good in animation? This show is brutal, fast, chaotic - like it!",/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2020,muamba_eats_toast,9," An absolute riot of fun!
",Absolutely hilarious brings something new to the comic universe an extra edge and originality a real delight to watch something so fresh! Really didn't want it to end can't wait for season 2.,/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2020,cherold,9," Funny, crazy, violent
","This anti-hero saga is hilariously funny, as sidekick Harley Quinn breaks up with Joker and attempts to start her own misfit gang with the help of best buddy Poison Ivy.",/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,bryondevine,10," FUN!
",I can't even begin to tell you how much FUN this show is..They took all the characters you know & kinda changed them a little bit & that's what makes this show WOW! So happy a 4th season has been announced. & BANE is an emotional reck that everyone clowns on. But Gordon might take the cake he's a hot mess can't even figure out his personal or professional life/way different from the calm had everything figured out character we all know..BATMAN/Bruce Wayne is all kinda losing his ðŸ’© too...Ivy is probably the best character of all the smartest & most mature character but she holds back & let's others do what she knows she could do without them. Anyways have a great time watching DECU for life :-),/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2021,mandykow929,9," DC made their own Venture Bros
","If you're a fan of Venture Bros, itself a parody of superhero and adventure comics, then you will like this show. It's the DC characters, but made into its own adult swim cartoons and I'm a big fan. I'm glad they can take their own IP and make some jokes and have some fun, but there is a lot of heart to the characters too. Gordon is an overworked alcoholic who is slowly going insane, but can be brought back by his daughter's love. Harley is able to realize she was in an abusive relationship with the help of her friends. It's funny and super violent, but has a surprisingly good storyline throughout. I'm excited for next season.",/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2019,mhroth-03528,10," wacky, brutal, unique, and gutwrenching
","I was nervous about this series. i was particularly nervous about the casting of cuoco as the lead; she's a very talented lady, but i was unsure if she was perfect for harley. i'm still not ENTIRELY sure she was, but she did a damn good job convincing me. by the end of the episode, her voice work had pushed me onto her side. the humor in this show is very unique. it has a brilliant tone of deranged zany madness, and it's just perfect for harley. i really loved it, and i cannot wait for more.",/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2019,CANpatbuck3664,9," A Fantastic Start for Harley Quinn, Keep it Coming
","This show had me from scene 1 of the pilot episode. Anyone who's going to have the &@!!$ to directly write what the villainous Gotham aristocrats say, sir or madam, you have my respect. Its all done for laughs and while that works, the subtext isn't subtle. But that's the primary joy of watching Harley Quinn for me, listening to these writers being genuinely hilarious while having enough brains to comment on what they want to comment. There's tons of cursing but they do have something to say about feminism and gender stereotypes and it all weaves together splendidly. I laugh constantly while watching this show but I was never not impressed with the meta winks and nods and the running commentary. The creative team completely accomplishes things on both fronts and I tip my hat to them. Harley Quinn may be the funniest show I've seen on TV lately but it has a brain behind it too, these are two essential qualities where most shows only are able to harness one or the other.",/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,amhurst110,9," Smart and funny
","In terms of character and source material this, unlike the Birds of Prey movie, doesn't miss a beat. Certainly it pushes the envelope in terms of DC continuity but it never goes too far. There is character development and, most of all, it's pretty damned funny.",/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2020,rynetate,9," I didn't think anything could make me care about ""New"" Harley, I was wrong.
","As a fan of the original introduction of the character in Batman: The Animated Series I always had a soft spot in my heart for Harley Quinn. Finding out about her relationship with Ivy made me even more happy years later. As a lifelong comic book reader I kept up with Harley and always loved when she would show up in Batman titles. The Margot Robbie version of the character certainly looks right (despite my love of her original costume much more so than other interpretations) but the script she was working with in ""Suicide Squad"" was laughable. The ""New 52"" version of Harley is hard to root for as she murders innocents on several occasions. But then this little gem of a show with an all-star cast, terrific animation, and just outright AMAZING writing comes out and makes me want more! I was so sad to realise that this is only a six episode season. I am chomping at the bit for more. I only hope that the comic book version of Harley has come around to reflect this version and isn't just DC's maniacally evil version of Deadpool. Well done, and keep it coming! The writers, cast, and animators on this show deserve a ton of praise!",/review/rw5381419/?ref_=tt_urv
