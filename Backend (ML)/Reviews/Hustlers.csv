17 September 2019,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,6," A pill that's easy to swallow but difficult to enjoy
","My primary thought is that I'm happy someone made a film that shines a spotlight on a very serious problem currently becoming more common amongst sex workers. As a sex worker myself, I am exposed to the perspectives and activities of a wide array of sex workers on a daily basis. I have observed an increasing amount of sex workers who feel validated in their decisions to become con-artists, bragging proudly about robbing their own clients. While I'm happy that this is starting to be discussed in the mainstream media, that doesn't mean it's a pleasant thing to observe. It's tragic that in an era when sex work does seem to be getting to a place where it's more openly accepted, we have unabashed behavior like this which is going to make people second guess any progress we may have established thus far - it's heavily counterproductive. Overall, the movie mostly just made me feel frustrated, sad, and worried for the future - but it was the correlation to reality that I couldn't get off of my mind. I wasn't very enveloped in the world of the film itself - mostly just reminded of my worries regarding the industry and the way it's pupils and society will carry on being effected by on another from here on out.",/review/rw5118185/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've seen this film getting constant hate before it's release and I honestly did not understand why and upon watching it for myself, I really don't understand. Hustlers is one of the most surprising films of the year with an intriguing true story and stellar performances with a possible career best performance from Jennifer Lopez.",/review/rw5118185/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2019,CANpatbuck3664,8," Lopez Steals the Show but Solid Acting and Camaraderie Makes Hustlers Entertaining
","When you're watching a movie about bad people doing bad things (gangster movies, financial crime pictures etc.) its naturally hard to sympathize with the characters. The movie has to do the extra work so you can picture walking in their shoes so you can see why the characters are doing what they're doing. My blueprint for accomplishing this (or the best template to follow) is the Martin Scorsese comedy The Wolf of Wall Street. Jordan Belfort (the protagonist played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and his buddy are TERRIBLE human beings, they're criminals, they're bigots and sexists and they don't care whose lives their ruining to get what they want (bigger parties, more women and most of all more money). But the ride is so crazy and watching them just splurge on anything and everything, its so fun that you let go of your morality just to join them on this journey. This is something that Hustlers manages to do and if this hadn't been accomplished, the movie would have dropped like a stone. The actions of Ramona (Jennifer Lopez), Destiny (Constance Wu) and their partners in crime are awful, sure their victims are @$$holes, but they're still drugging them, stealing all of their money then using their positions as strippers to shame them into not reporting them. If the genders were switched, this would be a horror movie. Luckily, the camaraderie between the girls is so strong and its so fun to watch them enjoy the fruits of their labours, you can put the morality of their actions aside and just follow them. I enjoyed watching this movie just for the performances and the vibe it exudes with these women pulling one over on ""The Man.""",/review/rw5118185/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Hustlers"" (2019 release; 110 min.) is ""Inspired By a True Story"", we are reminded at the beginning.

Then a Latina woman named Ramona makes her grand entrance and does a spectacular pole dance as Fiona Apple's ""Criminal"" blasts from the speakers. Duly impressed, Dorothy reaches out to Ramona for some dancing tips, and the two hit it off. We then go to ""2014"" where we see Dorothy being interviewed by a journalist...

","This movie wasn't the worst one that I've ever seen. That being said, it certainly wasn't the best.

","Given that I read the article written by Jessica Pressler and seen the 20/20 The Hustler documentary, the movie left me unfilled. By any means not saying what these women did was right but three women hustling rich Wall Street men out of their money was fascinating but the way this movie was told was too hollywood. Here's what I thought was missing and didn't make sense. The 20/20 documentary gave me more insight than the movie. I had more respect for these women. They were like the wolf on Wall Street, three women hustling Wall Street men out of their credit cards. But watching the movie I didn't see that. There were good laughs here and there but I walked away without a complete story. This movie had too many big names and wasn't focusing on the storytelling. If this film had did more research and took more time, this could have been bigger than wolf on Wall Street. Their story was in a continuous loop of the crime rather than getting to the root of why it really started in the first place. Working at gentleman's club is not all glamours and these women don't go after their money because of the stock market crash. This film did not have a lot substance for me to want to see again. Second movie JLo has produce that I was disappointed.",/review/rw5118185/?ref_=tt_urv

","Fair or not, Hustlers is very much Goodfellas with strippers, but that's not a criticism necessarily, but more of just a comment on the structure and tone of the story. When following main characters that are criminals, more often than not the film shows the rise and fall, and Hustlers is no different as the rise is far more captivating than the latter. I haven't seen a ton of Jennifer Lopez performances, but Hustlers is far and away the best she's ever been. The sequence on the pole that everyone is talking about just goes to show you how impressive she can be as a presence without saying many lines. Is she good enough to warrant a nomination? I'm not sure about that, but it's worth the discussion. The bottom line being that Hustlers is a story that should be told and I'm thrilled it was.",/review/rw5118185/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2019,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," Great performances, decent directing, amateur writing, terrible editing
","J-Lo was amazing in this role, as was Constance Wu, but novice writer and director Lorene Scafaria did an ok job directing, but the screenplay was garbage, with many plot and technical issues, especially towards the end. The pacing was too slow for the story, and the 110 min run-time felt like 3 hours. And the abrupt scene cuts by editor Kayla Emter... a kindergartener with plastic scissors could've done a better job. Aside from this being based on real events and (surprisingly also cast) Cardi B's acknowledgement she's done this, I do agree that this ""girl power"" garbage has got out of hand. I wasn't impressed with all the gal's playing victims and none of the men they robbed weren't. Clearly a one sided opinion coming from an entirely all-female production. That alone lost points from me. This film is not even close to the fake 10's - it's barely at best a 7/10, but also not worthy of all the 1's and 2's (production value alone is at least a 4). It's an honest 6/10 from me, most points for the leads performances.",/review/rw5118185/?ref_=tt_urv

18 September 2019,blazesuncaster,8," I thought this was just gonna be another oceans movie. Boy was I wrong
","Man. I went into this movie thinking that it was gonna be a heaping pile. I was wrong. This is the story about a group of strippers who don't agree with the work that Wall Street is doing and that there stealing peoples money, so they take it into there own hands by ""Hustling"" people and stealing there money by drugging them. This movie explains how hard it really is to get a job out in the world, they show the characters trying to find work but fails and then goes back to stripping for a living. This was a sad movie, and it was just heart breaking at some parts. Just like. Think of your worst day ever. And then just keep adding worst things to it. That's what these people feel. Heart break is the key aspect of this movie. And also stripping. The one thing I didn't like about it was that they put Cardi B in it. The only reason I could see them doing that is because she used to be a stripper before she became a rapper. I just thought her acting was bland. Good for Cardi but bad for acting. Over all this movie was honestly really good, I had a blast watching it with my friend.",/review/rw5118185/?ref_=tt_urv

","Lorene Scafaria absolutely kills it. Hustlers is a well written, tremendously directed film.

16 September 2019,tabuno,9," A Brilliant Slice of Life of Female Survival
","Constance Wu who shot to fame for her starring role in the American Asian breakout film Crazy Rich Asian (2018) appears to have the lead role in this movie even though Jennifer Lopez has a starring role and the possibility of her receiving an Oscar nomination that has been talked up. This female directed and written movie by Lorene Scafaria along with co-producing credits going to Lopez and interestingly enough Will Ferrell displays on screen an edgy and authentically, finely balanced mood and tone film imbued with both sharp drama and a genuine comedic humor rarely enveloped into one movie. While there are a lot of titillating suggestive scenes, this movie avoids the glamorization of the striptease unlike that overly stylized in the musical and Oscar winning Chicago (2002). Instead Hustlers focuses on a raw look at women living a life that is both hard and reflective of the struggle that every woman faces, including the responsibility of caring for one another and their children. This amazing and compelling experience of a slice of life is powerful and sensitive portrayal of the connections and the travails of the lives of what seems to amount to be essentially single women living in a high-stakes life in an effort to survive. The only weaknesses that stand out are the absence of a more descriptive understanding of Wu's interaction with her boyfriend and their evolving relationship and Lopez's apparent willingness to retain a connection with one of her more questionable hustlers.",/review/rw5118185/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2019,jboothmillard,8," Hustlers
","This film, inspired by a true viral New York Magazine article, was getting a lot of attention, including talks of Oscar nominations, and being described as something like The Wolf of Wall Street, so I was really interested, written and directed by Lorene Scafaria (Seeking a Friend for the End of the World). Basically, former New York City-based stripper Dorothy (Constance Wu) is being interviewed by journalist Elizabeth (Julia Stiles), a journalist working on a story involving her former friend and mentor, Ramona Vega (Jennifer Lopez, also producing). In 2007, Dorothy, known by the stripper name Destiny, is working at a strip club to support her Grandmother (Wai Ching Ho) but is barely getting by. Dorothy watches a performance by popular stripper Ramona, they meet on the rooftop and hit it off. Romana takes Dorothy under her wing to teach her all the moves and to recognise the three different types of customers. The first type are stingy insecure men who can be for weeks if not months can be strung along, the second type are frequent regulars at the club, and the third type are CEOs, bankers, and hedge funders ready to spend thousands for a good night. Together, Dorothy and Ramona make a formidable team targeting their third type of clients, with Dorothy learning to enjoy her newly acquired wealth. In 2008, the financial crisis strikes, the club loses business and Dorothy and Ramona find themselves short on cash. Dorothy's boyfriend abandons her, and she is unable to find a new job. With no other options, Dorothy tries to return to stripping, but her old club is now used for prostitution, which she is unwilling to enter. Ramona, with fellow strippers Mercedes (Keke Palmer) and Annabelle (Lili Reinhart), introduces Dorothy to a new scheme: targeting rich men at bars, getting them drunk, and then escorting them to the club where the girls steal their credit card numbers and charge them to their limit. Dorothy joins them and learns that Ramona has also been using drugs like ketamine and MDMA to give their customers memory loss and impair their judgements. Dorothy argues that drugging the men is worth the risk since none of their victims will not want to be humiliated, admitting to being robbed by strippers or going to the police. The scheme seems to work, but some of the targets prove to be too aggressive, so they bring in other girls, who are carefully trained to avoid drinking or using drugs. Ramona's partnership with the club makes the credit card fraud lucrative for them, all workers are given their cut of the profits. But cracks start to form in the operation, when other strippers start copying them. A furious Ramona cuts business ties with the club, and the group service clients in hotels and their homes, they split the earnings between themselves. Following Christmas, the girls become increasingly unreliable, so Ramona brings in strippers with drug problems and prior criminal convictions to replace them, something Dorothy feels is extremely risky. Dorothy's fears prove true when a client nearly dies and she is forced to take him to the hospital while another girl, Dawn (The Handmaid's Tale's Madeline Brewer), needs bailing out of jail. Dorothy returns home one day and finds her grandmother has died. At the funeral, Ramona promises to take care of her from now on. In 2014, Dorothy becomes uncomfortable when Elizabeth insists on talking about Ramona and stops the interview, telling her to leave. Elizabeth returns home, but Dorothy calls her and agrees to finish their conversation. Ramona's callousness creates tension between her and Dorothy, who finds that she can no longer justify her crimes. Dawn is arrested and grasses on her partners, while investigators manage to locate several victims and identify the other girls. Destiny, Ramona, Annabelle, and Mercedes are arrested, but only Dorothy takes a plea bargain. Ramona manages to avoid jail time, while the others serve short sentences before being released on probation. A year later, Elizabeth goes to see Ramona, who now works a retail job, and she muses that Destiny was the only person she trusted to have her back, and that she treated her like one of her most valued possessions. The article is published, and Elizabeth encourages Dorothy to reach out to Ramona and make amends. Also starring ""Juice"" singer Lizzo as Liz, rapper Cardi B as Diamond, Mercedes Ruehl as Mama, the club's den mother, rapper G-Eazy aka Gerald Earl Gillum as Johnny and singer Usher as himself. Wu is splendid as the sympathetic protagonist, trash-talking Cradi B is memorable in her brief screen-time, Lizzo is likeable as well, but this film belongs to Lopez, strutting her curvaceous figure and with her fantastically swaggering diva performance. It has a fantastic soundtrack, featuring Sean Kingston - ""Beautiful Girls"", Britney Spears - ""Gimme More"", and Usher feat. Young Jeezy - ""Love in this Club"". The script is very witty, the themes of friendship, female empowerment and hustling are clever, and the club sequences, many being glamourous montages, are full of lavish colour, obviously there is titillation, with the sleazy men (most from Wall Street) being just fodder for the women, it a fresh and most impressive crime comedy-drama.

","Delightfully funny and well written story. From the beginning it gets your sympathy. When Wall Street suffers, it trickles down, all the way down! The effect of the 2008 financial crisis on lap dancers is hilarious and rings very true. Jennifer Lopez looks and dances terrifically and not just for her age. She acts well too just hard nosed enough yet likable. Lili Reinhart of Riverdale and Cardi B are good supporting cast. Constance Wu shows she can do something really different from Crazy Rich Asians. She is sweet and a sympathetic central character. Love the score - a highly original use of Chopin Etudes as a soundtrack. It's quite a feel good story for a crime story. Bit of a Pretty Woman / Mayflower Madam vibe. Of course they do show when they cross the line it is wrong. Wall Street hot shots can be victims too!",/review/rw5118185/?ref_=tt_urv
