4 April 2016,TheLittleSongbird,5," The second weakest of the Craig Bonds
","Although 'Casino Royale' is often considered the best Daniel Craig Bond film, my personal favourite is actually 'Skyfall'. That said, 'Casino Royale', after liking it well enough, fared much better on re-watch. 'Quantum of Solace' however was a major disappointment, and for me deserves its distinction as one of the worst of the series.",/review/rw3617210/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2015,george.schmidt,9," Craig continues to prosper as James Bond (in possibly his swan song turn as 007 if rumor has it) and does so with a bang
","SPECTRE (2015) ***1/2 Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ralph Fiennes, Monica Bellucci, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Dave Bautista, Andrew Scott, Jasper Christensen, Alessandro Cremona, Stephanie Sigman (cameo: Judi Densch) Craig continues to prosper as James Bond (in possibly his swan song turn as 007 if rumor has it) and does so with a bang: out to avenge the recently departed M as well as confront the nefarious leader of the titular conspiracy group hellbent on sabotaging international security at any cost. Waltz is slimily evil as the notorious Blofeld and a continuing supporting crew for Bond including aces-up-his-sleeve Fiennes as the new M, spunky and sexy Harris as Moneypenny and crafty Whishaw as Q. Bautista's near mute turn as a brute echoing Robert Shaw's blond Russian thug of ""From Russia With Love"" and Richard Kiel's Jaws from Roger Moore's pair of flicks is indeed formidable and chilling. While there is little believable chemistry between Craig and new Bond gal Seydoux there is the little-used but always welcome sultry Bellucci to spice things up. Director Sam Mendes returns to the franchise pulling out all the stops including a one-take non-cut opening salvo pre-credit trek thru Mexico City's Day of the Dead ceremony with Bond tracking an assassin that involves a crumbling hotel and one helluva vertigo inducing chopper sequence. Fast, fun and fierce and by all means make sure to see it in a big-screen/IMAX venue just to invision an 80 foot high Bellucci :D",/review/rw3617210/?ref_=tt_urv

","If Skyfall was the deconstruction of James Bond, Spectre is the reconstruction. Daniel Craig has returned once more as 007, with Spectre marking his fourth (and potentially final) outing as the character. In Spectre, Bond follows a cryptic message from his past, which leads him to the evil criminal organization known as SPECTRE. After three films, this is the first of the Daniel Craig Bond films that feels more like the Sean Connery/Roger Moore-era Bond adventures, and that is a good thing.",/review/rw3617210/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2015,harril-586-26745,1," A truly unexciting 'action' movie
","This is the worst Bond movie ever, filled with emotionless characters that I couldn't care less about. The pace of this film after a predictably exciting start is slow and boring. Unlike his fellow actors, Ben Whishaw as Q manages to portray the only believable human in this whole fake production. Why couldn't JB have been given a touch of Q's wit, humour or vulnerability? No wonder Daniel Craig wants out of this franchise - it's beneath his talent. Such a cacophony of totally forgettable dialogue, people and silly stunts is hard to imagine in a single movie and yet here it is. During one of the 'action' fights when James was being hammered by the evil assassin I noticed the person next to me had fallen asleep and was snoring. That person was an exceedingly eloquent critic.",/review/rw3617210/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2015,lnvicta,6," A thrilling spectacle that ties together the Bond of old with the new.
","Whether you like Daniel Craig as Bond or not, you can't deny he has been an integral part of the series' highest points. Casino Royale is one of the greatest action thrillers ever, let alone Bond movie, and Skyfall is right up there with Goldeneye as a quintessential Bond adventure. Following the magnificent Skyfall, Spectre had some huge shoes to fill, and for the most part, it delivers exactly what you'd expect. An attention-grabbing, tense opening fight scene, a lovely title sequence (whether the song is good is debatable), and an elaborate sinister plot surrounding James Bond that puts him up against his inner demons more than ever. Does it surpass Casino Royale or Skyfall? Definitely not, but as far as reintroducing the villainous organization SPECTRE into Bond canon after 40+ years, the film does more than a serviceable job, giving us a stylish action-adventure to boot.",/review/rw3617210/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2015,abisio,1," Mendez and Craig new milestone Worst Bond Movie Ever !!! Avoid it !!
","James Bond or Agent 007 has been since it beginning in books and specially in movies the standard male fantasy. He can seduce any women, practice every sport and win, drink as much as he wished and never get drunk, live all the fashion. drive the best cars (preferable Aston Martin) or any other vehicle (like jets, Helicopters, boats) and fight and kill any enemy without regret. The Regan era; and sadly most of his followers; consider the emblematic British spy as a piece of crap and decided to moralize it; both Timothy Dalton movies kisses required an AIDS test. Luckily Pierce Brosnan's Bond was somewhat a back to the origins. He smiled and made jokes;, seduced women, drink and kill when necessary; but some Hollywood asshole and a few absurd critics; decided it was becoming a parody and wanted for Jason Bourne style. A killer without personality looking for vengeance. ",/review/rw3617210/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2015,ironhorse_iv,7," I can somewhat bonded with this movie. It was mostly a good watch.
","Let's be honest, here. The dead is indeed alive. It's nice to see the words, Spectre come back from the dead, after a 40 year absence from the franchise. It has been way too long. The reason for this, is that when 1961's novel 'Thunderball', was being made; original James Bond author, Ian Fleming opt for some help from his friends, such as screenwriter, Kevin McClory & some others to make a film version of it. Only to screw them from writing credit, when the film script version was completed in 1964. This lead, to a long legal battle, between McClory & Fleming, until McClory won out, in 1976; retained the filming rights of the novel. With that deal, came the lost, at least ten previous own literary properties & titles. One of them, happen to be the Spectre Organization in which, James Bond fight against in the novel, Thunderball. Once, considered as a future James Bond title in the 1960s & 1980s, Spectre wasn't made into a movie, until November 2013, when Eon Production and McClory's estate formally settled the issue. This allow, MGM, Eon Production's mother company to acquire the full copyright film rights to the concept of Spectre and all of the characters associated with. Still, the production for this film was troublesome. First off, the movie went, highly over-budget, and over-schedule. Many of these problems, came from the fact, that Sony demanded rewrites after a 2014 email hack. They really want to cover up, and recon the leak spoilers, even beyond when filming started. This cause, the movie to have a very incredibly underwhelming and at times, nonsensical third act. I have to say, its shows. The main plot of James Bond (Daniel Craig) trying to unravel, a new terrorist organization, doesn't match, well, with the sub-plot of M (Ralph Fiennes) trying to stop, his government from creating, a unified New World Order surveillance network. It was very uneven. I also get that the movie takes place 18 months, after the events of 2012's Skyfall, but it really seem, like all the flaws that James Bond had, in the last movie, is non-existence in this film. It's really odd, how he can barely hit his target in the last movie, and now, he's has the power of improbably aiming skills. It's so jarring. What happen to all of his weaknesses? For an action movie, this is probably, the weakest in the Daniel Craig's James Bond series of films. There are way too much, badly done, CGI effects. It's always stale, when we see the same, repetitive action. Most of all, lots of bad guys just standing around, talking and making idiotic decision making. Still, they did, get some hits on Bond. Sad, the whole torturing scene isn't one of them. I didn't like the whole, non-selling. It was a bit confusing on what the hell, was going on! However, I do like the demolition scene that the villains plan. Still, the filming process must have been extremely miserable for both the returning director, Sam Mendes & main actor, Daniel Craig. There has been times, when, Craig had joked that he would rather slit his wrists than play 007 again, and Mendes threating to leave, the production. However, I guess, cooler heads prevails, because they were able to pull, the movie, off. It was far from being a total disaster! In my opinion, the movie that has James Bond's first encounter with the global criminal organization, Spectre, since 1971's Diamonds Are Forever was mostly alright to me. I have only a few problems with it. First off, the movie length. It's a really strained watch. Since, the movie does have some slow & often clichés parts, you really feel, the long runtime. Still, the movie does have a lot more, humor than the previous Daniel Craig's films. I like, how the writers were a lot more open to a lot of old school Bond mannerism. It's nice to see that side of Bond, again. Also, I do love the cool references to the older films. Great homages. I also like, how Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) & Q (Ben Whishaw) are given, more to do, than minor background characters. Some of the best scenes, are with those characters. However, this movie is missing the emotional drive. The chemistry between Bond and his main love-interest, Dr. Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux) is questionable at best, due to the age different. I really found, their love-affair, kinda forced. While Seydoux was alright as eye-candy. Her acting, not so much. Her French accent is a little distracting. I kinda wish, the minor, bond girl, that Monica Bellucci plays, had a bigger role in the plot. After all, Daniel Craig indeed love, working with her, the most. She might be 50, but she's still gorgeous. Christoph Waltz as the villain, Franz Oberhauser AKA Ernst Stavro Blofeld did a great job at being the charming host/criminal psychopath. I also didn't mind, Dave Batista's minor role as the henchmen. However, I kinda, wish, he had more lines. There was a lot of grief over Sam Smith's new Bond song: ""Writing on the Wall, but it sounded grand and a fitting Bond song over the credits. It's not amazing, but sure it's better than a lot of other recent efforts like Madonna. I just didn't like the weird octopus porn opening, but I did dig, the Día de los Muertos opening with Thomas Newman's score. Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema did ensures that Mexico City are never less than ravishing. Don't care, if they got taxation benefits, because of that, but I didn't, how the movie travels from one exotic location to another. It was too much! Too hard to keep, track of it. Overall: While, it fails to pack the emotional punch. Spectre is 007 out of 10. It's still worth seeing.",/review/rw3617210/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2015,Sleepin_Dragon,8," Just go and see this movie. Make your own mind up.
","It's the kind of movie you walk out of the cinema feeling buzzing, a difficult film to review because it feels so different from the recent Bond movies, especially those with Daniel Craig. In my opinion he's been wonderful, and I hope he carries on for ages yet.",/review/rw3617210/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2016,kalle_ankare,1," Ronald Bond
","This movie is somewhat watchable if you manage to convince yourself that the hero is Ronald Bond, brother of the more famous and successful James Bond. Ronald of course, unlike his brother, is not the suave charmer and rascal type, but has more of a polish wrestler look and demeanor. This makes for some light comedy when Ronald is shown to be one of the few men that can't look smart and elegant wearing a suit, which incidentally only make him look more silly and distinctly out of place. Ronald also has to rely on fools luck more than skill and intelligence to save his ill conceived ways of handling things. At the start of the movie for instance, he manages to raze two entire blocks of houses whilst trying to perform the simple task of taking out a bad guy with a snipers rifle. Not only that, but he also manages to miss the intended target.",/review/rw3617210/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2015,adamscastlevania2,10," Mark the occasion. Bond is finally back on track.
","Since as far back as the late 1970's there have only been a handful of strong entries for Bond. The series was lost in the 80's with too little bite coming from the tail end of Moore's output, and too much of it for most people's taste from Dalton's ""Licence to kill"". Then, like Bond himself, the series then was gone without a trace until a highlight in ""Goldeneye"" awoke and it was good to have the killer back once again; but it didn't last. The following entries are largely forgettable and nothing more than throwaway entertainment. ""Casino Royale"" was yet another new clean slate and things looked promising once again, that was until ""Solace of shaky cam"" got rushed out and hopefully for the last time pulled the spy toward being nothing more than a Bourne wannabe. Now though things are looking promising, and all I can say is it's about time. Sam Mendes has driven the series back on form with two of the better entries in decades. This like the great ""Skyfall"" has what's needed to make a good Bond film. It has the action, the style, the fun, the locations, the women, the bad guys, with sheer bags of quality to back everything up. This doesn't top ""Skyfall"" which would have been hugely difficult, but it gives Bond something he hasn't had for far too long: A strong back to back big hitter.",/review/rw3617210/?ref_=tt_urv
