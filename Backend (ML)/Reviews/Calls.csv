14 August 2009,snickers797,8," It's about life long metaphors, not the science.
","Something I often find bothersome in 'time travel fiction' is that there is usually a large chunk of the storytelling dedicated to the tedium of explaining 'how' time travel works, particularly when time travel is merely a device to aid the storytelling. We don't really need to know the science behind it because, simply put, science can neither logically explain its paradoxical nature, nor prove or dispute its possibility. ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" never makes pretenses to the science behind it, rather it centers its focus on the story.",/review/rw6056033/?ref_=tt_urv

","In Chicago, the special collections librarian Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) has a genetic anomaly that allows him to travel in time; however, he is not able to control the moment or the destiny of his voyages. When the stranger Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams) meets him in the library, she invites him to have dinner with her in his favorite restaurant Beau Thai where she confesses that she has been in love with him since she was six years old. Henry leans that he had visited her many times in the real state of her parents and he falls in love with her.

16 August 2009,saarvardi,8," Hollywood deserves a big kudos for not messing this one up!
","The Time Traveler's Wife is based off of one of the best books I've read in recent years. Naturally, the movie couldn't come close to catching all the little details that made the book so captivating, since like any other film it had a limited time frame he had to work with. However, the Hollywood adaptation (with Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams as the lead rolls) did do one thing right: it captured the heart of the novel and transferred much of the book's atmosphere to the big screen. Now, as much as I've always hated those original-material purists who nitpick on every little detail in a given adaptation, I have to say the work done on The Time Traveler's Wife was extraordinary loyal in spirit to the film.",/review/rw6056033/?ref_=tt_urv

","On a cold winter's night Clare (Rachel McAdams) confesses to her husband Henry (Eric Bana), ""I wouldn't change a second of our life together."" McAdams and Bana are both beautiful and amazing in Director Robert Schwentke's ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" based on the bestselling novel by Audrey Niffenegger. ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" adapted by screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin is a bitter sweet and strange love story. It is not perfect; although, it ends perfectly. There is a timeless and yearning quality that engages in ""The Time Traveler's Wife"". However, Schwentke and Rubin might have leveraged sharper emotional arcs at particular narrative points. During the course of their lives, Clare and Henry experience tragedy and joy. In spite of this, Rachel McAdams is stunning. I am in love with her.

","To my surprise I really enjoyed this movie, I ain't really a big fan of American romance movies but this one got my attention from beginning to end. What I liked most about it is how in the beginning your left confused but as the movie progresses it's like putting a puzzle piece together bit by bit until you figure it out. So the movie is basically about romance and time travel, it's about a guy that can travel to any stages of his life but not by free will, it just happens. And during the different stages of his life, it shows different stages of romance with the girl he fell in love with. It's well worth seeing it with your girlfriend, even if your not really into sappy stuff. Figuring out the mystery will keep you intrigued.",/review/rw6056033/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hoping for a sweeping saga on love's ability to transcend dimensions a la ""Ghost"" or ""The Lake House,"" ""The Time Traveler's Wife,"" Robert Schwentke's melodrama achieves neither the grandness it aspires for nor (at least) a constant sense of giddiness for its leads Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams.

","While the concept of 'The Time Traveler's Wife' appears pretty clever, the actual execution proves quite inept. Eric Bana is Henry DeTamble, a Chicago librarian, who has some kind of genetic mutation which causes him to skip around in time. The twist is that every time he jumps in time, he loses his clothes. You might think that the image of the naked Henry scrambling around for new duds as he appears in different eras might have the potential for some neat comic possibilities—but humorless director Robert Schwentke opts for a completely heavy-handed, serious approach.",/review/rw6056033/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2009,inkblot11,5," Lovely to look at, with two gorgeous stars, but the story has so many flaws that it ultimately becomes pointless
","This movie was disappointing, not because of the two gorgeous, touching stars or the cinematography, but the story's fantasy premise has so many flaws, so many inconsistencies that it collapses, making the whole affair rather pointless, in my opinion. So, go with caution, those of you who love romance or the two main cast members, for you may be satisfied with these elements. The storyline features a gentleman, Henry (Eric Bana), who, as a child, escaped from an horrific car accident by ""time traveling"" to a different place. The crash, however, killed his mother and drove his father to alcoholism. Continuing to travel throughout his life to different time periods and places, he finds himself in a meadow one day, where a beautiful little girl is preparing a picnic. She will grow up to be Claire (Rachel McAdams) and become the wife of the time traveler. Meeting again at a college library, as adults, the two fall desperately in love and marry, but, complications are always present. Claire, a budding artist, is often left to spend holidays alone and worries constantly, for Henry sometimes travels into dangerous neighborhoods and situations. Then, longing for a child, the couple experiences acute disappointment time again through miscarriage. Although Henry uses his abilities to purchase a winning lottery ticket that buys them a lovely home and art studio, will they ever be truly happy? And, what about strong indications that Henry will die in his early forties, in a violent way? As stated above, there are elements to admire about this film. The two stars, Bana and McAdams, are attractive, talented actors who work very hard to make the film a success. Also, the lesser cast members, including Ron Livingston and Arliss Howard, do fine work as well. Then, too, the scenery is lovely, from beautiful meadow to stately mansion and back again. Costumes and camera work are of the finest. It is, unfortunately, the story that is wanting and since it was a book first, which I did not read yet, this reviewer does not know if critical issues were left out that would have made a more sensible story. For example, Henry always travels ""nude"", leaving a pile of clothes when he departs and arriving naked at his next venue, causing him to have to steal the first available clothing. Why is this so? Can't clothes travel too? In addition, questions about why he can travel to his own wedding, nearly on time, but have no control over other episodes is puzzling and that's just the start of a long list of inconsistencies. Because fantasy relies on a set of ground rules to be successful, in my opinion, this one doesn't work for me. The direction, too, is tentative and the flick has many slowly moving scenes. In summary, if you love romance first and foremost, you will probably want to see this film. All others, however, should ponder awhile about plunking down ten bucks for a ticket, when it might be better to wait for the DVD or other low cost alternatives.",/review/rw6056033/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2009,jaredmobarak,8," I really wish she could hear you sing  The Time Traveler's Wife
","I'll admit that after reading some early remarks about Robert Schwentke's cinematic version I was very worried, in fact so much so that my expectations were somewhat low. This fact might have weighed on my ultimate decision concerning my enjoyment in seeing the DeTamble family's story on screen because I actually really bought in and was swept away for the journey. Yes, a lot, (and I do mean a lot), is omitted through the adaptation process of Oscar-winner Bruce Joel Rubin, but enough is kept to stay true to that romantic tone. Distilled down and perhaps dumbed-down, The Time Traveler's Wife may lose some of its geeky sci-fi flavor, but the heart and soul remains intact to be a solid date movie and entry to the romance drama genre.",/review/rw6056033/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you thought that ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" starring Mr. Benjamin Bratt taught you a lot about life and love, then hold on. There is something else coming your way, and it's name is ""The Time Traveler's Wife."" The lovely Canadian starlet, Miss Rachel McAdam, turns in a powerhouse performance as a young lady who learns about the value of standing by the man you love, even though sometimes he is 45 years old when you're 12 years old, and sometimes he disappears inexplicably and then shows up naked when you least expect it. Talk about popping in unannounced! Maybe you think it's stupid that this lady planned a large wedding in front of tons of people, knowing full well that her beloved Eric Bana could disappear at any moment, leaving her with the catering bill that as you can imagine came to quite a hefty fee. But as for myself, I find it appealing and devil-may-care. ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is a valuable lesson about life, love and second chances, if by second chances you mean that this guy shows up multiple times in the nude and tells you that he loves you. It's a realistic portrayal of love and relationships in today's world, and I think we all stand to learn a lesson.",/review/rw6056033/?ref_=tt_urv

30 March 2019,nancyldraper,9," A favourite of mine
","This is another favourite of mine. Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana are superb in this. The romance is complex and captivating. The time travel is allowed to stand on its own, implimenting good storytelling rather than lengthy scientic justification. The McCann sisters perfectly meld into Alba in her several ages. Most of this was filmed in Toronto and in the surrounding Ontario, so there are lots of Canadians showing up in the supporting cast (Yay! You could make a game of it - Spot the Canadian). Love the ambience of this film, the understated sense of wonder and yet still anchored in the real struggles of a relationship. Great music. Even on rewatching (multiple times over the years) I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Fantasy Dramatic Romance}",/review/rw6056033/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2010,Hitchcoc,6," Some Books Shouldn't Be Made Into Movies
","Forget the scientific problems with all this. Let's just assume that such a thing happened. Imagine the curse of being this man. If you ever saw a film from the Sixties called ""The Incredible Shrinking Man,"" which is also a bit allegorical, he was able to find his place in the universe as he moved into nothingness. The character here is so cursed as to never be able to finish anything he starts. Not only that, he arrives almost anywhere, naked, penniless, needing to be a thief or a beggar, at the mercy of anyone who is around. How much predetermination there is is never mentioned. He occasionally returns to a kind of linear world, seeing his love at different times in her life. He is apparently immortal and dead at the same time. The book does a nice job of creating an interesting human being, aware of all these issues and trying hard to manage. Here, he is at the whims of the gods and is just moving through life. It just doesn't work. I didn't get the affection thing at all. I saw him as a hopeless, sad creature.",/review/rw6056033/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2010,erose001,6," Lacks the emotional and scientific wallop of the novel
","As a stand-alone creature, *The Time Traveler's Wife* is a nice love story about a nice couple struggling with an unusual difficulty. The actors do a fine job with the material they were given, but unfortunately, what they were given was a pale shadow of the original tale. The original tale was fleshed out with much stronger plot points, subtexts and symbolism, with supporting characters who had a real role to play in the progression of the plot. Several of these have been jettisoned completely, others are there for reasons that really make no sense other than to be ""couple friends."" (For example, the character crucial to the ending in the book is only alluded to and not in the context of the ending.) The whole reason for the ending was completely glossed over (to say more gives away an important novel plot point), the intensity of the struggles the couple faces are barely evident, and their motivations (driven by some of those very same supporting characters) are unclear. Obviously one can only fit so much of such a dense work into a two-hour feature, but there are other ways this could be done without making the story a superficial shadow of its former self. Hour-long TV dramas do a better job of providing this kind of writing, characterization, and directing (even those that are not serialized). Furthermore, while the novel gives us a range of characters with whom to identify in a very complex and surreal conceit, the movie only gives us the central two characters, which means if you don't identify with them, you're not going to enjoy the movie. On the other hand, if you do, and if you haven't read the novel, you may enjoy the story as a superficial love story with a clichéd ending. Novel lovers, beware, a key scene, the one that ties everything together at the end of the story, is completely missing, and that was, to me, the greatest loss, as it actually went to the heart of the love story itself.",/review/rw6056033/?ref_=tt_urv
