","I'm unsure what is more worrying, that Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau starred in such a mediocre comedy or the fact that they wrote it. Good friends and regular collaborators Vaughn and Favreau have had mixed results in their working partnership: Swingers is a bona-fide cult classic which tore up the indie circuit back in 1996; Made was a disappointment to all those expecting Swingers 2; The Break-Up was a successful guilty pleasure and Four Holidays (Four Christmases in the US) flopped massively at the US box-office. Where does Retreat fit in? Somewhere near Four Holidays – but at least they didn't also write that.",/review/rw2143478/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2009,bobm5508,2," shockingly unfunny!
","What a wasted opportunity! They take 2 of our finest comedians, a beautiful cast of hard working actresses, and a great tropical setting and it comes out a stale, lifeless. laugh-free mess. Man, this was painful to watch. Vince fired off a few smile inducing one liners in the start-up domestic setting, and that was the last smile they got out of me. Once the cast was moved to the tropics, everything went wrong. Male on male embarrassment was overused -- about 5 times. Vince tried a few off the wall diatribes that fell flat. Young women swoon over Jon Favereau (huh?!?!) and he ignores the fabulous Kristen Davis?! The pratfalls to marriage are glossed over and play out badly. Every scene seems to last about 5 beats too long. Favereau gets not one, but two masturbation scenes. What??! Neither comes even close to delivering any humor. All 4 couples have shaky or totally damaged relationships and then in a 10 minute whirlwind finale, all solve their problems in a totally superficial way. And I couldn't possibly have cared less about the ""Guitar Hero"" duel. Yikes!! ",/review/rw2143478/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2021,wfalenta,7," Far better than the low rating
","It's not going to win an Oscar, but it's not an awful movie.
I think the people who enjoy this can probably relate to a character which leads me to think it's the slightly more mature audience.
Those who rated it low probably enjoy crap like Gods of Egypt. Enough said.
Sit back, relax, and don't take it too seriously. Enjoy the gorgeous views of Bora Bora",/review/rw2143478/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2020,carrienorval,9," Why all the negativity?
",I absolutely love this movie - it's our families all time favourite and never misses its mark with giving us all a huge laugh. I am really surprised by the low scores given by so many other people. I guess it goes to show that everyone is different when it comes to what they enjoy but I have given this a 9/10 as it's a great giggle and as a mum of 3 who has been married 15 years I can honestly relate to some of the characters. Love this!,/review/rw2143478/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2022,AnnaPagrati,10," Adore this!
","I loved this movie so much! I watched it really randomly one day, didn't even know what it was about, but it was so fun & cute! The plot is really interesting & I love the actors!",/review/rw2143478/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2020,blackwidowis7cool,8," Why is this hated?
","It's not meant to be taken seriously. It's just meant to be a romantic marriage therapy adults comedy and give you plenty of laughs - which it succeeds at greatly.
Solid and realistic acting from its highly talented cast - Jason Bateman (Nick Wilde in Zootopia), Kristen Bell (Anna from Frozen), Jon Fravreau (do I even need to remind anyone who he is?), Vince Vaughn, etc., etc. (Even John Michael Higgins).
The plot MIGHT be a bit thin, but hey! It's a comedy. Again, not a serious drama that needs a solid, well-built plot. But everything goes the way it should - even with a few bumps and crude stuff a long the way for the characters.
A great movie that you'd enjoy (please don't watch with the kids).",/review/rw2143478/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2009,archiecm,4," The last half more than kills the opening first-half fun
","Are we supposed to want these couples to get help? (which 75% of them needed.) On second thought, I don't even want to go there. ",/review/rw2143478/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2009,Sebastian_Berlin,4," Dialog so shallow it was almost appalling.
","I just read a few reviews for ""Couples Retreat"" here on IMDb and I agree with most of them. A few good laughs in an otherwise mediocre script and a movie that isn't quite sure of its target audience. Rather than repeat what has been said before, I'd like to use the opportunity to talk about an issue that really bothered me. Towards the end, around the time our main characters reach the fabled ""Eden East"", the jokes recede and the dialog takes on a more serious note. The men start to discuss each other's relationships, which is then followed by a number of appropriate make-up scenes for each of the four couples.",/review/rw2143478/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2009,DonFishies,7," Hilarious at times, but never really strives to be more than average
","Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia (Kristen Bell) are dangerously close to getting a divorce. In a last ditch effort to save their marriage, they decide to take a vacation to a tropical resort meant to help ailing couples through therapy. Short on cash, they enlist help from their friends to offset the cost through a group rate: the kid-raising Dave (Vince Vaughn) and Ronnie (Malin Akerman), the lovelessly married Joey (Jon Favreau) and Lucy (Kristen Davis), and the recently divorced Shane (Faizon Love) and his much younger girlfriend Trudy (Kali Hawk). The three other couples think they are just going to have fun and help their friends, but they realize they are in for having their relationships examined as well.",/review/rw2143478/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2010,phd_travel,1," Painfully inadequate
",Vince Vaughan and Jon Favreau are not good enough to write a full length movie comedy. There just aren't enough jokes or a decent enough story to carry this movie. Most of the jokes fall flat. Not even worth a chuckle. Didn't anyone read the script first? The lewd jokes are just lewd not funny.,/review/rw2143478/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2009,Smells_Like_Cheese,5," Had potential but turned out to be nothing special
","After seeing the trailer for Couples Retreat, I wanted to see this movie, I had to see this movie, I also promised Vince Vaughn I would, lol. I met him at a Blackhawk's game a couple weeks prior to seeing this movie and I told him I was excited to see it and he said ""you promise to see it?"", gotta give the man credit for plugging in the movie into our conversation, lol. But even with that, I still wanted to see this movie, it did look honestly funny, but I didn't get to see it until the Monday after it opened originally. I was hearing some bad or okay reviews which disappointed me. But in my opinion, it doesn't matter, it's what you think of the movie, so I still saw it. While the movie wasn't bad, it definitely is something that is forgettable. It just became a typical romantic comedy at the end that really disappointed me. I'll explain why it's a disappointment in a moment.",/review/rw2143478/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2010,Chrysanthepop,," The Dream Resort For Couples except...
","Wow, so many negative comments regarding 'Couples Retreat'. I admit it's not classic but I enjoyed it for the most part. I definitely prefer it over the likes of 'Hot Tub Time Machine'. Most of the jokes in 'Couples Retreat' work well and it didn't bore me to sleep like the aforementioned example. I also liked that they didn't use too many toilet humour. Yes, the film does drag at some point and the story is your usual, with nothing new to offer and it has a rushed ending but the comedic interaction between the actors is great.",/review/rw2143478/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2018,glenn-major,8," Excellent comedy, but issues
","Faultless comedy start to finish, but a few film directorial, sequence and continuity editing issues let the film down, taking it down a peg or two from say a Judd Apatow production. Nevertheless, highly polished in the main, eminently watchable and most enjoyable, especially if you identify with any/many/all of the characters and their situation.",/review/rw2143478/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2010,brettchatz-1,5," Mindless comedy that borders on the pathetic
","Couples Retreat pits the comedic talents of Vince Vaughn and a capable cast against one another. The storyline is as tired as old leather, but there are just enough witty remarks to keep this trite comedy drifting along.",/review/rw2143478/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2019,ed-503-465183,7," It's not a rom-com it's more of a com-rom. I think it's fine.

22 April 2021,eldoct,10," These guys as always are crazy

27 December 2009,headly66,1," Avoid at all cost.....
","I knew I was in for a treat when I got at least 2 pee and 5 ball sack jokes in the first ten minutes of this trite excursion into dullsville. Everyone here plays exactly what you would expect of them, basically themselves in real life. This must have taken very little time to make and seems to just be a paycheck for the actors. The plot is ridiculously contrived, a couple is having troubles so to reassess their lives they want to go to a beautiful retreat but can't afford it even though they seem rich so they force their friends to go also on a weeks notice. The club is said to be so hard to get into but for some reason they offer half price for 4 couples, which makes a lot of sense. Their only black friend who seems completely out of place here (and not because he's black) has no money but who is buying a motorcycle somehow, can also go with his 20 year old love tart whom everyone has no problem with joining them even though she obviously only cares that he buys her things but agrees to go through couples counseling even though they just met.",/review/rw2143478/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2015,SnoopyStyle,4," the resort is annoying
","Dave (Vince Vaughn) and Ronnie (Malin Åkerman) are a loving couple with two little sons. Joey (Jon Favreau) and Lucy Tanzini (Kristin Davis) are high school sweethearts with 18 year old daughter Lacey who is about to go to college. Shane (Faizon Love) is separated from his wife and is with a much younger girlfriend Trudy (Kali Hawk). Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia Smith (Kristen Bell) are unable to conceive and considering divorce. They give a PowerPoint presentation to entice the other three couples to go to therapy resort Eden the next week. The retreat is divided into Eden West for couples and Eden East for singles. Marcel (Jean Reno) is the unusual therapist owner. He is joined by therapists Ken Jeong, John Michael Higgins, Charlotte Cornwell and Amy Hill. Then there is the overly amorous yoga instructor Salvadore (Carlos Ponce).",/review/rw2143478/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm not sure what movie the other reviewers on here watched but it wasn't the same movie i watched, this movie sucked pretty badly. I could see the whole sarah marshal thing it was trying to replicate but it fell short on every level, the writing was terrible, not at all witty and none of the characters were believable although Vince was OK, he was the exact same character he plays in every movie.
