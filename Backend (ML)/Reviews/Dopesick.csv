23 December 2022,seansoulo73,10," Perfect Ending to a Cult Classic
","Been rockin' with the Best Man franchise from day one and although I didn't know what to expect with the switch from film to a TV series, Malcom D. Lee and company pulled it off wonderfully. I'm about the same age as all the cast members, so in '99 I was a single man who had already walked away from an engagement. By the second installation I was married with kids, and now with this latest and final reboot, I'm 20 years in on this marriage journey.",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,annette705,6," So many plots left dangling
",Felt cheated out of seeing Lance develop his new relationship and his wedding. Making Lance have sex with random women was unnecessary and not true to his character as a God fearing man. What happened with Candace's dissertation and the pervy professor? What about Quentin and his father - Did they sell the hotels or keep it in the family? What about his father's health? Did Murch continue fighting after winning that one bout? Way too much airtime was given to LJ. He has nothing to do with the Best Man movies. That was valuable time that could have been given to other storylines that needed closure.,/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,Advocate1,10," Excellence on display
","This is the kind of excellence I love to see from us! The cast, the chemistry, the final chapters. First, the idea to make it a series is great, instead of one movie, you get three! The storylines are great, full of all the twists and turns you expect from this crew. The first two episodes have a special guest who is a nice addition. The youth in the movie do a great job as well!! The final chapters leave you wanting more, but I believe we will get more. Without giving away the details, there is no way the show is going to end the way it did. I think the network wants to see how good it does, so go watch it. Tell your family, tell your friends, co-workers, church members, get these numbers up because this type of excellence isn't always on display!!",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,yvette-78552,8," Loved It!!!
","Absolutely loved it!!! Loved the evolution of all of the characters dealing with real life issues. ""Adulting"" and trying to navigate life and everything that comes along with it....the good, the bad and the ugly. The ups and downs of maintaining relationships and the ability to work through problems, issues, secrets, falling outs and allowing love and true friendship to prevail. I too identified with so much that the characters were dealing with...Real Life, Real Problems. Kudos to Malcolm Lee for writing these characters in such a beautiful way that allowed us to grow up with them. Excellent work by the cast for bringing the story and characters to life and allowing us to close the final chapters of their lives. I am so happy and pleased with the ending of the stories, but I'm holding out hope that this isn't truly the end.",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,Alwnva,10," Final chapters? Need a Prologue
","So, every once and a while you get a group of friends that are completely well rounded. To be able to catch up with friends throughout the years is a treat. It's satisfying to celebrate black culture. I do appreciate that the characters have layers and dimension. I know someone like each of these people. Music is an essential part of black culture and they have the soundtrack for this saga just right.",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,leighabc123,9," This Was A Creative Continuation of The Best Man Series
","It was creative seeing all the Best Man Characters grow up and mature. All the actors and actresses are excellent. The actresses look fly in this series. The actors were funny! It was nice seeing Monica Calhoun in dream sequences, even though she had cancer and died during the last Best Man movie. I didn't like how they shoved non binary down our throats by making LJ non binary. It would have been better if all the characters lived happily ever after. But in real like, things do not turn out that way. I am looking forward to seeing a new season of this series. Maybe things will turn out better for the characters.",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2022,gianthaole,3," Doesn't do the movies justice
","Oh what could have been. I really enjoyed The Best Man and The Best Man Holiday. So when you have characters that are already established and the movies entertain and help you escape what's going on in the real world, why would you take those characters and that entertainment and stick them in the real world?? I wish they would have written stories that have nothing to do with real world stuff. They even mention the Will Smith slap to Chris Rock. How is that going to age well in a limited series? If you haven't seen the show, I would skip it and just stick to the movies. Too much wokeness for me.",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,woodb-24441,3," Extremely Frustrating and Felt Betrayed
","I was extremely excited to watch The Best Man: The Final Chapters, and when I did I felt so disappointed and frustrated by what I saw. I think the two movies are phenomenal and the characters in them feel like real people and the actors have phenomenal chemsitry, but I have so many problems with this series. The characters don't even seem like the same people as in the movies. Spoilers Ahead on what I thoguht on each storyline.",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2022,melodyccomrie,9," Loved it
","I loved it! Real life, real problems, real talk. All the things that happen when you grow up and life happens. Everyone has grown up and reached certain pinnacles in their life, but are still searching and reaching for happiness. Very relatable as someone who grew up in this era. Monica Calhoun was definitely missed on this movie. These episodes also touched on issues front and center in many of our lives and touched on how important relationships are to keep, self care and spiritual fulfillment as important in our lives",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,kaydrelia,4," Meh, missing the magic
","Not sure what happened, but there's chemistry and magic that the first two movies had that this series is missing. There's chemistry missing between the actors, the writing is a mix of being woke and trying to be funny and dramatic and it just doesn't work. The first couple episodes on the island were decent, then it just went downhill. Still love the characters, but they just didn't seem to want to be there in this series, something was way off. Disappointed, I'll stick to the two movies and their magic. Proof yet again that reboots in this new generation just don't work, magic is rarely re-created.",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,dawntezino,10," Love, Love, Love it!!
","My husband and I have been waiting for this limited series to drop and had it calendared. I am only three episodes in and it is awesome! We are huge fans of this franchise because it mirrors real life exquisitely. The characters embody what it means to be successful black people and navigating friendships from college into older adulthood. The storylines are always on point and great actors of course!! This is definitely a holiday treat!! So sit back and relax and let the show take you on a journey! So excited. Also gorgeous location and set!! Cheers and best wishes for continued success of this newest franchise addition. I know it's supposed to be the final chapters but we can dream that it continues, can't we??",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2022,eddieaduko,7," Great series!
","It was a great serious, I identify with every character at some point. Real problems, real storylines. The only thing that kinda ruined it was the producers tryna force the LGBT/pronouns stuff down our throats...also the way Lance initially coped with Mia's passing was a bit...unexpected for a guy who was portrayed as strong, god-fearing and family-man in the last 2 movies.",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2022,LoveGrace13,1," Smut.. Just Complete and Utter Smut, Smut Peddlers
","I watched The Best Man 2 a few days ago and cried my eyes out, little did I know this trash would be birthed days later. You took the one God fearing character and you turned him into a man who lost all his morals after his wife died. What is up with y'all? Not all black people turn to strippers when they have a tragedy. If Lance was as God fearing as his character was projected to be he would have turned to God to heal him and helping others to help him cope. You could've and should've asked a believer in Christ what would really happen in that reality. You had all the means and opportunity to but you chose not to. I turned off this episode after all the talk of him 85 percent wearing a condom and asking Harper if he F'd the unicorn. You've turned this franchise into smut. You took a quality character and turned him into smut. You had two little girls talking about sex and you thought it was funny. We are in 2022 not the 2000s when unoriginal tasteless corny jokes slid by. We have awakened to God now and are over you and your crap. We have had enough smut over the years Hollywood! Nobody wants to see that anymore. Get with the times. The Lord reigns, I'm out.",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,denise-99445,10," 10 - YEAH, IT'S THAT GOOD!
","Malcolm Lee has finally given us the cherry atop the sundae with his The Final Chapters. The Best Man: The Final Chapters reunites college friends, Harper, Lance, Quentin, Murch, Candace, Shelby, and Robyn. When we catch up with the upwardly mobile friends, they are coming together to celebrate a wedding: lothario, Quentin is finally getting married to an Icon, Xiomara Amani. Lance is still grieving from the death of his beloved wife and as a result has become quite promiscuous. The group of friends are at the top of their games in their respective careers but experiencing mid-life crises for various reasons, (lack of emotional and career fulfillment, work/family imbalance, getting older, etc.) The series covers a lot of ground in its final chapters. We get a wedding, divorce, sequel movie in a movie, topical issues such as COVID-19, racism, Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ+ issues, parenting parents while still raising our children and yet Malcolm Lee and the ensemble cast expertly bring it all together. The attractive cast has SO MUCH chemistry that it is a joy to see them onscreen together again. The tropical setting, lush homes, beautiful clothes and with New York as a hometown setting are all a work of art on screen. I absolutely LOVED THIS SERIES. If you were a fan of the first and second movies, then this series is an absolute must see. I binge watched it in one sitting on New Year's Day - and yeah, it's that good!",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,kgizza2002,10," Amazing
","It's a great addition to the movies and is very well written and of course the acting was superb. Pleasantly surprised! It was great to see the old cast reunited and to see how they have aged over the years. It's funny but the series still deals with very serious and relevant issues. The story reflects on things that has happened between the last movie and the current series. It's not a hacky remake, it's well put together and was made with thought and care. I would highly recommend this series to any body that wants to binge a great series with comedy and heart warming moments. Well done to all involved.",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,sweetlaci,9," Better than I expected
","This show is better than I expected. I finished Bestman Holiday and a new one came on. I thought I was watching a movie but turns out it was episode 1 of the final chapters. The writing is so good. Every episode speaks to me. The only thing I felt was overdone was when Murch had those flash forwards of what he'd do to ""Karen"". Yes I'm black but I thought one was enough. Also wish LJ coming out or being outed was done differently.",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,Entertainmentsparadise,8," So this is what menopause and mid-life crisis looks like

25 December 2022,maiwescm,10," Great
","I love the way they brought us up to date .. it was funny, sad, endearing.. I also love that they were all in it. I know it's the final chapter but I hope they do more. The producer Malcolm Lee did a great job on each episode and I noticed Robert Townsends name in one of the credits. I love how they showed growth in each person although it was a journey. There were parts when I said that is so real for today and I had watched the 2 before again to catch myself back up but it was really not needed as they made sure we saw the main highlights of the prior movies. I really enjoyed Shelby and Quentin.",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,tehrijackson,10," I'm giving it a 10 because of the legendary cast of course and the classic that is the best man, but something's was a no
","Love the cast , legendary of course , still look good , amazing actors, honestly in my opinion the actors of today can't hold a candle to these artists they know their craft very well, but I do agree too much was put on LJ, wasn't feeling his whole storyline, they could've just had him feel like he was pressured to live up to his dads legacy , they ain't have to do allat extra lol, however Lance's activities in the beginning I'm sure was for shock value cause it shocked the HECK outta me lol, glad he came outta that. I would've like to see who Harp gets with next ... Jordan? We'll never know😞 And I do wish they would've used lance's other kids more instead of just LJ , they made it seem like he only had 2 kids at first I get it but, LJ's storyline I could've went without like I said before. I think it was smart for them to have Robin and Harp break up , even in the first movie I just never thought they matched completely sad about the Ghana move though. Legendary nonetheless!!!!!",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2022,kkcannady,8," Pretty Good
","Although I love the actors and the franchise, I'm going to be honest with my review. The first two episodes were like a mini movie and very entertaining. Yes we all can tell that the actors have aged and it's more than 2 years have gone by since Best Man Holiday but let's just imagine... If you let go of reality and enjoy, you will be ok.",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2022,godsbest-11498,1," Stopped before end of first episode...
","Having seen the films several times and recently in preparation for this series I was disappointed. First, the show wants to make believe that only TWO years have gone by since last film when it is extremely obvious by how much older the actors look that more time has passed. Second, last film ended with Jordan being happily in love and ready to settle which would have ended her character arch lovely, yet, in order to start over with her the series has her back to being single and career driven. Third, Lance delivering Harper's baby in the previous film and the passing of Mia took their relationship to a new level where they promised to be there for each other, yet, we're supposed to accept that 2 years have gone by and Lance needs intervention? Other flaws. Oils be pointed out but to keep things short I can't believe the same people/company who gave us the films we're also the ones to give us this series. I will pretend this series never existed.",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have been a fan of the franchise all along, the actors have been superb, the storylines fantastic, and then this! I did not know it was coming, and came across it randomly, and I have binged it all. It is like getting a whole other set of movies but overlapping each other in a way that is not only complete but has me begging for more. I do not care what you come up with, but make this happen again, please.",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was a really great way to end the series. For the most part, I really enjoyed the way that each character developed and how their ""lives"" turned out. I was also really surprised at how easy it was to fall back into the characters. It was like no time passed, it felt like getting connected again with old, dear friends. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention that Morris Chestnut looks better and better with each of them, yes, I did go back and watch the first two movies.",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,amitriabarron,1," Too much Betrayal & Sneaky crap
","So the betrayal of Jordan and Harper made me sick to my stomach. Why would they take a classic movie and everything? Robin and Harper went through just to have him cheat on his wife with someone from his past I will never watch another season of this is junk. I have never seen a man that put his work and his friends above his wife and daughter. It seems like the side chicks and the mistresses are winning the hearts of the devoted family men. Jordan and Harper never had chemistry on the movie. She was just a nosy control freak that put her career above everything and that's the only thing her and Harper heading,",/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv

",I've watched best man since the first movie. Loved every single moment of the movies to show. This show was timely need. It was put together very well and loved the fact of being able to get more of each of these characters story's. It spoke on all of life's issues from the present and I'm sure will help many understand the many choices life will gives us. When we get knocked down it's alright we will make it thru. Thank you for this series of the best man very much needed and appreciated. Glad they kept all the characters as well. If you haven't watched yet what are you waiting for go watch this series!,/review/rw8797110/?ref_=tt_urv
