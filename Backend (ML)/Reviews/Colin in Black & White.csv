13 November 2021,PatrynXX,10," I liked this one better than the first.. Somewhat contains a bit more of the original emotion of the Holmes we know
","And a bit of the Young Sherlock Holmes .. Killing off Sherlocks lady early at the beginning hey should know what not to drink given the first. So who knows if she did or not. This had more action than suspense in the first one.. None of that Sherlock is a criminal crap. I'll still have the first at 9 so if this is better I've filled out the stars..
Think the only negative is all that slow motion stuff not his slow mo in his head but say the ammo chasing the Runners in the forest scene ...zzzzzz",/review/rw2761633/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2012,remedy305,8," Sherlock at the movies
","Doesn't matter how you look at it, this movie is darn good fun. I loved it from opening credits to the close. So what if the acting is a bit over the top, so what if there are probably too many explosions and bullets and bombs. The end result is a thoroughly entertaining 2 hours at the movies with popcorn and Pearl and Dean ads. Moriarty is sufficiently creepy and played with restraint, Holmes is completely over the top but for me if its Robert Downey Jr there are no complaints. The story keeps moving and the action is terrific. The story is loosely based on the last book of the Conan Doyle's first series of Holmes stories ending with the famous Reisenbach Falls in Switzerland. It also gives a great image of early 20th century on the brink of the first world war. If you want to enjoy a good story with great imagery and costume then you will enjoy this, if you are looking for Sherlock ( wonderfully called Shirley by Mycroft ) as Conan Doyle intended then you may be disappointed.",/review/rw2761633/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2012,kosmasp,8," A fine game it is
","While we have new ingredients (= actors/characters) such as the girl formerly having a tattoo and a new bad guy, we also still have our beloved Holmes/Watson duo. And by that I mean the same actors in the role. Jude Law and especially Robert Downey Jr. having a lot of fun again and it shows.",/review/rw2761633/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2012,TheLittleSongbird,7," Not as good as the first, but very entertaining
","I, as a fan of Sherlock Holmes and of the portrayals given by Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett, personally loved the first Sherlock Holmes, it was fun, stylish and clever, with impeccably matched leads and a good villain, even with moments of annoying slow-motion, things getting convoluted and draggy in the second hour and Rachel McAdams.",/review/rw2761633/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2011,dottyjyoung,9," What a relief! The trailers lied--it was awesome. :)
","We just got back from the earliest showing we could get a sitter for. I can say with confidence that my fears about this movie were totally unfounded, and I now hold Guy Ritchie and these writers in the highest regard. Without going into spoilers, here are the three concerns that were put entirely to rest: 1) After seeing the trailer, my biggest worry was the use of ""bullet-time"" type photography during a Victorian-era movie. I thought it would be completely anachronistic and pointless. However, they'd already established in this movie and the previous one that Holmes is hyper-aware of his surroundings. The bullet-time was used to convey how traumatic a couple of scenes were to someone with that type of awareness, and it worked beautifully.",/review/rw2761633/?ref_=tt_urv

With the help of his pal Watson (off to be married soon), and a gang of gypsies, which includes The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's Noomi Rapace, set out on a game of cat-and-mouse to find the schemes of the sinister Professor.",/review/rw2761633/?ref_=tt_urv

","Guy Ritchie can't go wrong all his films have incredible action and story among other things! Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are enriching greatness throughout! An adventure of many sorts filled with witty dialogue, action madness, and soundtrack that is glorious. I originally saw this in the theater that was fun especially when I had someone to go with.",/review/rw2761633/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2011,DonFishies,8," Entertaining and a lot more fun than the original outing
","As much as I loved the character interactions and insane chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, I was very much let down by Sherlock Holmes when I first saw it a few years ago. It was a really stylish and well-made film, but the storyline bored me to tears. I came in incredibly excited to see it, and left wishing it had ended sooner. With the obvious sequel Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows upon us, I figured I would go in with much lower expectations and brace for something along the same lines.",/review/rw2761633/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2011,aakinz,10," NO disappointment in this sequel
","Talking about sequels, more often than not, they are disappointment compared to the original. But this team has done again. They brought back the sequel with quality. I enjoyed this film as much as I did in the first part. The action, thrill, intelligence, all are placed perfectly in this film. The screenplay and making pattern is pretty much same as the first part and story moving in good pace. The main characters did a fantastic job once again. Holmes and Watson chemistry is perfect and delivered a great performance. Here I really like the way how the hero and villain play their games, both are very clever and the equality was very interesting. Simply, if you liked the first part, just go for this one. This is perfect entertainment and No disappointments.",/review/rw2761633/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2011,PWNYCNY,5," Since when is Mr. Holmes a cartoon character?
","Sometimes one watches a movie and weeps because the story is so strong and compelling that it evokes a cathartic experience. And then there are movies that cause the eyelids to grow heavy and the mind to wander off to slumber land. This movie is in the latter category. Sherlock Holmes is not a cartoon character, yet this movie not only transforms Mr. Holmes into a cartoon character, he is a cross between Daffy Duck and James Bond. Not surprisingly, the movie provokes some unintended (or maybe intended) laughter, but with a ridiculous story that brings new meaning to the word contrived, there is little that can save this movie from DVD land where it belongs. Robert Downey and Jude Law give it a try, but their efforts are for naught. Sometimees the current is just too strong. The story is simply too implausible and the special effects too gratuitous. Okay, tastes change and maybe the producers are playing to a certain audience. But one thing that does not change is quality, and in this respect the movie could have been better.",/review/rw2761633/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2012,phd_travel,2," Too much action not enough brains and ludicrous plot
","Sherlock Holmes is supposed to be about clever mystery and crime solving not martial arts action, Mission Impossible style disguises and futuristic plastic surgery. Most of the plot is so impossible for the time period. The machine guns, the plastic surgery, the massive weaponry etc - it's just so wrong. There is little humor and they made Sherlock so beaten up and damaged looking.",/review/rw2761633/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2011,ferguson-6,7," Careful what you Fish for
","Greetings again from the darkness. Normally if a sequel shows up a mere two years after the original, we would have good reason for low expectations. However, director Guy Ritchie is back and just as importantly, Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law reprise their roles as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Sticking to the successful template provided by the original, the team delivers one that is sure to keep the fans happy.",/review/rw2761633/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2012,a-ozornin,6," The sequel that forgot about what made the original so good
","This is the second installment of the Sherlock Holmes franchise starring Robert Downey Jr. as the great detective. The first installment, which I saw exactly two years ago, was very impressing. That was a completely new take on Sir Conan Doyle's never dying detective story, full of style, fascinating action, humorous dialogs and amazing soundtrack. Robert Downey Jr. reinvented Sherlock; his Holmes is arrogant, sociopath but nevertheless absolutely lovable. The movie was peppered with something called ""flash-forward"" – which is how Sherlock planned his fights. Overall, the movie was easy to watch, the storyline kept attention and visually it was very organic. ",/review/rw2761633/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2012,DJAkin,1," I was not amused nor entertained....
","I went to this movie with high hopes. As it turns out, this movie was nothing more than pure drivel. It was simply drivel. Everybody says that this was the best of the two movies but I found myself frequently looking at my watch! Professor James Moriarty was very much a bore. When he was hidden in the room and talking from behind a curtain, Professor James Moriarty was a hopeful as an evil doer. Then he pulls the curtain back and he's simply a professor. I was hoping that he would at least have a scar or something. But there is nothing sinister about Professor James Moriarty. Now let's talk about Sherlock. For whatever reason, he is unable to be defeated in any kind of a fight. He has a ""disorder"" in which he can predict the outcome by observing things. Professor James Moriarty was just smart and good at chess. But Sherlock has this weird sense of humor in which he feels compelled to crack a joke every time he opens his pipe filled mouth. He even jokes around between punches in a fight. When he talks to Dr. Watson he jokes around and poor Watson is a cheap imitation of the strait man from the Three Stooges. Yes, you read that right - he's a strait man. As for Professor James Moriarty and his plot to take over the world by killing somebody in the mansion overlooking the water fall in the mountain, I have no idea. This plot was far to complicated. As let's not even talk about the gypsy people and their role. Oh, and what is the deal with how Sherlock blow coffee beans into that large brute's eye? Can you say RANDOM? Anyway, Professor James Moriarty is nowhere near as evil as I was hoping. I give this movie TWO PIPES DOWN!",/review/rw2761633/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2011,dtucker86,," Watson as he should be portrayed
","This may shock a lot of people but I actually liked Watson in this movie better then I liked Holmes. Jude Law does an awesome job and I think that he captured Watson the way that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wanted him to be portrayed. Most people think of Nigel Bruce as Watson from the early Holmes films with Basil Rathbone. He was portrayed simply as a bumbling old fool, the comic relief. Doctor Watson was portrayed in the stories as a loyal friend, a skilled doctor and a brave man in a crisis. Robert Downey's interpretation of Holmes may offend some purists but it passed muster with me (one small quibble, Holmes always has to wear at least one disguise in his movies and in this case I thought he made an ugly woman!). I don't think that I have ever seen a Holmes movie where he kicked as much ass as he does in this one, its like Rambo is playing Sherlock Holmes. We don't get to see Holmes really utilize his intellectual gifts until almost the end of the movie. SPOILER ALERT This movie follows Doyle's original story The Final Problem where Holmes and Moriarty fight at the waterfall and both apparently fall to their death.",/review/rw2761633/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2012,denis888,6," The 1st Movie Was Better
","Well, I am bit puzzled. What can I say? Was the movie well done? Yes and no. There are certain weak parts and obvious stronger bits. Jude Law and Robert Downey Jnr both are great as Watson and Holmes, as well as Stephen Fry is a very funny Microft. But then, there are some big mistakes in casting. Noomi Rapace is The biggest blunder. She was great in The Swedish Girl Who... Trilogy, but here no. She is weak, pale, blunt, shallow and gray. The only part we remember of her? Her eating some food near The Eiffel Tower. Pity that there is no so much Rachel McAdamas this time, she was great then and good here What else can I say? The movie is well cut and shot, it is dark and ominous, as intended, and some scenes are pure Matrix-quality. But then, there are so many goofs and funny anachronisms that make the whole movie a bit unserious. My opinion? it was OK, and fun. A bit too prolonged at times.",/review/rw2761633/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2013,rmax304823,5," Holmes: Killed in Action Movie.
","On the plus side, the acting isn't bad. Downey's Sherlock Holmes is adequate, including his accent. From certain angles he's beginning to look like Dustin Hoffman as he aged. Jude Law, likewise, delivers as a more than usually active Dr. Watson. Sebastian Moran I dismiss, but Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty is quite good, especially considering that he doesn't look the part as it was described in the canon. Best of all, though, is Steven Frey as Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's brother. His flabby geniality and hooded eyes suggest a wry dispassion. I think he may have been Oscar Wilde in another film. If he wasn't, he should have been.",/review/rw2761633/?ref_=tt_urv
