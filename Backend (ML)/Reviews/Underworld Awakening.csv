29 June 2009,Chris_Docker,9," Right out of the water
","""All my films have started with an image,"" says director Andrea Arnold. ""It's usually quite a strong image and it seems to come from nowhere. I don't understand the image at first or what it means, but I want to know more about it so I start exploring it, try and understand it and what it means. This is how I always start writing."" What does the image of a fish tank conjure up for you? On the inside longing to look out, is fifteen-year-old Mia. Trapped in a housing estate. Trapped in a single parent family. Trapped by people around her she can't respect. Trapped in herself. For being fifteen. She has her own inner world, fighting to manifest itself . Fortified by cigarettes and alcohol she can kick in the door of the empty nearby flat. A bare floor. Her CD player. Practice her moves. A better dancer than those kids on the block she just nutted.",/review/rw2400336/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2010,howard.schumann,10," An exhilarating dance of liberation
","The poet Rumi said, ""A rose's rarest essence lives in the thorn."" The thorn is in full evidence in Andrea Arnold's compellingly honest second feature Fish Tank, the story of a fifteen year-old girl's struggle for self respect after having ""grown up absurd"" in the London projects. Fish Tank, a film that is overflowing with life, works on many levels – as a look into squalid economic and social conditions in small town Britain, as a warning to those who act impulsively and without self-control, and as a coming-of-age story that allows us to experience a genuine sense of character growth. Winner of the Jury Prize at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, the film features an astounding performance from first-time actress Katie Jarvis, a 17-year-old who was discovered by the director while having an argument with her boyfriend on an Essex train station platform.",/review/rw2400336/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2010,bob the moo,," Impacting, gritty and very well made even if it is a little bit longer than the material can bear
","Considering how much positive word of mouth it got, Fish Tank came and went pretty sharpish in most cinemas – even those in a larger city such as where I live. This was a shame as it meant I had to keep an eye out to eventually catch the film. Set on a council estate things are typically grim and within the first few minutes of the film we are treated to sudden violence and extreme language – all seemingly par for the course rather than being something special that we are witnessing. In this world lives Mia, a 15 year old who lives with a younger sister and a mother who appears to be not much older than her. She gets in fights and practises dancing by herself in an abandoned flat near her own. Her life appears to change for the better when her mother gets a new boyfriend who is friendly, good fun and is not put off by the sudden aggression that is the signature of life in the family home.",/review/rw2400336/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2010,dave-sturm,9," A step beyond the kitchen sink
","As an American who used to be a fan of British ""kitchen sink"" drama I can say this film not only eclipsed those films, it eclipsed that whole genre, which was about poverty-stricken males who vented their rage against whoever crossed their path, usually females. ""Fish Tank"" turns all that inside out. This is ""grrrrrl"" kitchen sink.",/review/rw2400336/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2010,LunarPoise,7," She's 16. It's her time.
","Sixteen is not a good age for horses. And fifteen is proving equally difficult for Mia. Fifteen going on 50, Mia lives an isolated, disaffected life. A school drop-out, labelled weird and smelly by her peers, she is neglected by her single-parent mother and converses at a bawl with her younger sister, who is 8 going on 40. Mia haunts the high-rise she calls home, sneaking alcohol and ciggies where she can get them. Her only pleasure is dance, which she practices solo in an upstairs derelict flat. Something has to change, and the catalyst proves to be Mum's new boyfriend. Both creepy and charming in the manner of David from An Education, the boyfriend seems to take Mia seriously. Perhaps too seriously.",/review/rw2400336/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2009,nqure,8," Much more than a stereotypical kitchen sink drama
","Like Arnold's first long feature 'Red Road', 'Fish Tank' is a much more emotionally complex film than its apparent setting – a council estate in Essex- and subject matter initially suggests. Both films contain an element of mystery and a revelation which makes us reassess the characters and their motives.",/review/rw2400336/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2010,druid333-2,10," Another Grim & Gritty Parable From England
","If you think England is only good for turning out glossy, romantic films adapted from their classic novels,guess again. England has long become a staple for some grim,gritty,edgy stories of the darker side of the human condition (with an emphasis on the working class---I guess they're channeling the Charles Dickens within them). Recent films such as 'Nil By Mouth',and 'Ratcatcher' have cemented this reputation. Now add Andrea Arnold's equally harrowing tale of existential despair, 'Fish Tank'. The story centers on Mia,a scrappy 15 year old girl,played with gusto by Kate Jarvis. Mia has an attitude problem,a short fuse,and has no problem solving adverse issues with her fists (evidant by an altercation in the film's opening with another girl,where Mia head butts her,giving the other girl a bloody nose),or her mouth (she has no problem cussing out anyone who crosses her path,including her Mother & little sister,who also boast of filthy mouths). Mia's big dream is to become a big time Hip Hop dancer & is always practicing her dance moves. Things take a turn for Mia's worse when her mom brings home a new boyfriend (Michael Fassbinder),who has less than wholesome designs for young Mia. Along the way,Mia attempts to make friends with an older boy who is in the process of restoring an automobile. As with other girl's her age,Mia experiments with the usual attractions:alcohol,drugs,sex,etc. All of this makes for a film that is not always easy to watch,but easy to admire for it's bravura. Andrea Arnold ('Red Road'and several made for British television projects)writes & directs this kitchen sink view of the British working class. Prepare yourself to get kicked in the stomach for 123 minutes. Not rated by the MPAA,this film contains pervasive strong language,an outburst of violence,flashes of nudity & sexual situation,including abhorrent adult behaviour involving a minor. Not for the little ones.",/review/rw2400336/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2011,down-emily,9," Oh, Mia
","Watching this movie felt like a painful, yet necessary experience. This is coming from someone who nearly loved the movie. But it's true, no matter what you think about it, Fish Tank is not easy to watch, at times. I'm not saying it's particularly gritty, but it just rings too close to home to ignore. We deal with this image every day, we see these kids, wasting their lives and their talents between grey walls, staring into space emptily, trying to get away from some shitty family and we see that shitty family, living in a piling mess of mediocrity. And after we see this, we try to run away quickly, cover our eyes and pick a comforting view again.",/review/rw2400336/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2010,C-Younkin,7," Take a fishing trip
","Andrea Arnold's ""Fish Tank"" was a big hit in Britain and at Cannes and now tries its hand at America, who will probably nickname it ""White Precious."" Anchored by a star-making performance from Kate Jarvis, Arnold's film is more grit and zero melodrama, a step-up from the weepy style of ""Precious."" Jarvis plays Mia, a teenager living in the ghetto where kids expect to follow in the option-less footsteps of their parents. Her little sister (Rebecca Griffiths) is already smoking and emulating skanks on MTV and mom (Kierston Wareing) is a drunk throwing parties with very sketchy friends. Mia has a dream of becoming a dancer and she finds encouragement from mom's new boyfriend, Connor (Michael Fassbender), a hunky security guard who seems like a nice guy but is, at times, ""too friendly."" It's familiar other-side-of-the tracks territory but it doesn't spend time wallowing in misfortune. Arnold's film is harsh, and with its use of language (the C and F words are used a lot), dead-end scenery, breathless sexual and violent encounters, and Jarvis' award-worthy portrayal, it's nothing short of compelling. It's a brave performance, a rough-fighter exterior masking youthful vulnerabilities. Fassbender also impresses as a charming/shady character that you're never quite sure has a sexual or fatherly preference toward Mia. It all comes down to a predictable yet scary ending where neglect turns dangerous.",/review/rw2400336/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2009,kennyevans,9," Dirty, honest, sad, lonely but strangely uplifting...
","I just watched this in the Grand Lumiere theatre at Cannes FF, a brilliant experience and a fantastic film! What struck me immediately was the use of natural light in this film. It really had that feeling that you were there and there were none of the typical Hollywood looks to people and sets. It had a very British feel, very much in the vein of Loach's Kes.",/review/rw2400336/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2014,tr91,4," A slow burner that never really takes off
","Fish Tank is a film that I had high expectations for but it fell considerably short of the mark. The premise of the film sounds like a great drama but for me it just didn't work. First of all the film is way too long for what it is, its 2 hours long and hardly anything happens! This easily could've had 30 minutes edited out as some scenes added absolutely nothing to the story.",/review/rw2400336/?ref_=tt_urv

","At first I wasn't sure what to make of this movie. Having watched ""Red Road"" by Andrea Arnold, I needed to watch Fishtank. It wasn't quite as good as Red Road but somehow it had something that mesmerised me.

30 July 2010,saadgkhan,9," FISH TANK is not your usual Teenager Drama; it's Rebellious, Seductive & above all Real!
","FISH TANK – CATCH IT ( A ) Fish Tank starts off as another teenage drama but its gripping hold over characterization sink you in and you realize that it's not just another Teenage Rebellious Drama. The movie is shot in totally unusual way and the whole presentation of the characters is through the Lead girl Mia played by Katie Jarvis Its terrific the way she carries off the role, she was totally natural and not even for a second you feel like you are watching a movie, her reaction to situations were cruel yet real she is not a trained actress and got this movie by chance & that's completely shows in the movie. Another Stunner in the movie is ""Micahel Fassbender"", he is Seductive as Hell (I wasn't familiar with his previous work & thanks to IMDb I came to know that he was in my three other favorite movies as well 3OO, Inglorious Basterds and Eden lake). Michael Fassbender played his role with utmost ease and charmingly that weather you like him or not? It doesn't matter because you'll just adore his persona Kierston Wareing played her part as a drunken mother with complete perfection. I defiantly would like to give credit to director Andrea Arnold who choose a subject like that & then presented it in totally extraordinary & realistic way. Overall, FISH TANK is not your usual Teenager Drama; it's Rebellious, Seductive & above all Real!",/review/rw2400336/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2010,Polaris_DiB,8," Sympathetic
","The movie starts out and we are treated immediately to row after row as Mia (Jarvis) walks about the town picking fights with basically anybody that comes into her path. Quite quickly, her home is shown as a small apartment with three women, Mia, her mother, and her sister living too close together for space and too far apart emotionally, with alcoholism predominant in all of their lives no matter their ages, and little patience for anybody. Mia's mother then brings home Connor (Fassbender), another in what is inferred as a long line of men, only this guy seems kind of nice and actually bothers to reach out to everyone in the family. Of course at this point in the movie, nobody's expecting it to be a clean-cut family drama with the new man bringing everyone together and teaching the girls how to be family again, because Andrea Arnold's tracking hand-held camera and cold symmetrical cinematography has already indicated that we're in kitchen-sink realism territory, and Connor's own appearance is suspicious as what kind of simplistic good natured lout would get involved in this family? From there, the camera tracks a not unexpected, but still personable and engaging, story of a 15 year old girls' first romance and her frustrated struggles with her own emotions.",/review/rw2400336/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2010,doctorsmoothlove,5," Paint Dry
","The difference between Fish Tank and other recent films about poor girls is its lack of (original) narrative. Director Andrea Arnold depicts a story that is a glorified retread of nearly every youth-in-trouble film. It's a recreation of a situation that is familiar to anyone with a brief understanding of what it's like to be poor. We do not see anything uniquely English other than accents and locations. The movie doesn't need to take place in Essex. It just so happens that the director and leading actress live there. This story could be transplanted across the pond or across the world for that matter. It isn't terrible, yet it's awfully generic.",/review/rw2400336/?ref_=tt_urv

26 May 2011,skysaxon,," Stunning theatrical debut from Katie Jarvis and director Andrea Arnold
","I left this movie stunned and stilled. Katie Jarvis' expressionless voyage through her 15th year soaked my entire attention into her character's being until I was her. A masterful performance of reserve and barely suppressed anger, frustration and awe permeate Jarvis' every move. While the character does unforgivable things at times, she is never who she seems to be on the surface. One can't help but pull for Mia and empathize with her inherent goodness, masquerading as it is under a steely, cold demeanour. ",/review/rw2400336/?ref_=tt_urv

","You may be wondering what the meaning of the title is, well it is basically a metaphor of what it is like to watch, like gazing through the glass of an aquarium at the lives of those trapped within, and ironically there is a small scene involving fishing. Basically on an Essex council estate lives fifteen year old stroppy and foul-mouthed Mia Williams (Katie Jarvis), who lives with her tarty single mother Joanne (Kierston Wareing) and equally foul-mouthed younger sister Tyler (Rebecca Griffiths). She has been excluded from school and is waiting for referral to seen what happens next, so she spends her days aimlessly wandering, only making a friend with Billy (Harry Treadaway), one of three owners for a horse that is sick and dying, and escaping her troubles listening and dancing to hip hop music. Then Mia's mother's handsome Irish boyfriend Connor O'Reily (Michael Fassbender) comes to the house to spend a lot of time with them, and what starts out as an uneasy friendship does grow slowly into an understanding. One night she secretly watches him and Joanne have sex, which he notices her twice but doesn't seem to be bothered that she is looking. Mia one day passing the local club she spots a poster advertising for wanted dancers, and so Connor lends a video camera so she can film herself showing off her dance skills and apply for an audition. One night while her mother is in bed, and both she and Connor have been drinking he asks her to show her talent to him, and sitting together they end up kissing and having quick sex, which he asks her to keep secret. Next morning Mia sees Joanne crying, Tyler saying that Connor is gone, so she tracks him down to his home, he explains he cannot see them all anymore before driving her to the station and giving money to get home. But she decides to walk back to his house and sneak into his empty house to look around, and she finds out that he is married with a daughter, Keira (Sydney Mary Nash), so she urinates on the floor in anger. Mia hears them returning and sneaks out just in time, but she notices Keira playing in the street and persuades her to come with her across the fields, and the little girl ends up nearly drowning in the River Thames trying to escape, so she is allowed to go back. Walking home Connor manages to spot her and runs after her to slap her, before walking away, and the next day is when she gets another blow when she finds out that the dancers the people at the audition are looking for is erotic, so just after the music starts for her chance to impress she walks out. In the final scenes we see Mia pass Billy crying at the death of his horse, and when he invites her to join him to go to Cardiff she agrees, packs up, and has a last dance with barely reacting Joanne and Tyler before driving away. Also starring Sarah Bayes as Keeley. Young Jarvis gives a remarkable performance as the troubled teenager who wants to escape many problems and does this through her love and talent for hip hop dancing and music, the supporting cast members do well also, obviously it is full of grim and disturbing moments, but is is very realistic in how it shows it, and overall it is certainly an urban drama to be seen. It won the BAFTA for Outstanding British Film. Very good!",/review/rw2400336/?ref_=tt_urv
