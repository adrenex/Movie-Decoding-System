20 September 2017,ThomDerd,8," Jack is back. This time they did it right.
","Nice addition to the saga but still not as good as the old ones...I m a 30+ old big fan of the Pirates of Caribbean movies and absolutely love what Gore Verbinski did with the first 3. I was utterly disappointed with the previous potc movie (#4). I went to watch this new one with a lot of prejudice.
But luckily it was an epic and fun movie to watch! Extremely entertaining and connected with Verbinski's style and work. Lots of beautiful action scenes, nice landscapes, humour and never ever, at any point boring. Jack Sparrow is definitely back in great form.

29 May 2017,TheLittleSongbird,6," A decent, fun enough ride, could have been so much more however
","The best film in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise will always be the first, which is still a terrific film fourteen years later (has it really been that long, feels like only yesterday when first seeing it when it first came out).",/review/rw3719749/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2021,patches89,7," FUN BUT RUNNING OUT OF STEAM!
","As a big fan of the franchise essentially made from a Disneyland Ride the first 3 films were roaring successes and ""On Stranger Tides"" we saw a movie that just didnt quite come together and this is essentially in the same ballpark. The story sort of mirrors the first and the return of Will and Elizabeth with their son and Barbossa's daughter going after Poseidon's trident whilst new villaint Captain Salazar on the chase for Jack after his release from the devils triangle had the makings of another fun film but with no Hans Zimmer composing the score or Gore Verbinski in the director chair it didnt quite reach the higher levels, maybe time to stop now.",/review/rw3719749/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," totally forgettable movie
","With poor plotting, inconsistent pacing and a rushed sense of chemistry amongst the new cast Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales exposes the swashbuckling sequel as nothing more than a cash-grab that's as hollow as the ships they occupy.",/review/rw3719749/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2021,Authoric,2," Who are you and what did you do with Jack?
","Who is this new Sparrow? Because he's certainly not Jack Sparrow. He's a total (even drunker) drunk goofball AND moron, when before he was unpredictable and funny and all in all a brilliant character. There was a few good chuckles and enjoyable moments but I miss the old movies. Movies 1, 2 and 3 were the best. Watch it if you're a fan but don't expect to be TOO pleased with what you see. Because to be honest, the only good things about this was a tad bit of comedy, good special effects and a good cast. Bad storyline and bad character development. And wtf happened to Elizabeth's hair?!?",/review/rw3719749/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2019,Benjamin-M-Weilert,4," A film that proves it's time to abandon ship on this franchise.
","Part of me wishes that the title of this film were true. What I wouldn't give to have these dead men not tell their tale of revenge. That being said, I had some hopes that this movie would help redeem the franchise after the lackluster On Stranger Tides (2011). After all, Javier Bardem has proven to be an effective villain in such films as No Country for Old Men (2007) and Skyfall (2012), so I thought he could help carry this movie as a solid antagonist. Unfortunately, even he could not save this sinking ship of a franchise.",/review/rw3719749/?ref_=tt_urv

10 September 2017,claudio_carvalho,7," The Franchise Is Still Working Very Well
","After watching with very low expectations to ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"", it is hard to understand the legion of haters that write in IMDb. The film is not a masterpiece but is funny, entertaining, with great cast, special effects, screenplay and story. Johnny Depp performs the wolf, drunken and smart Captain Jack Sparrow in the usual funny way. Cinema lovers of fantasy-adventure genre must ignore the bad reviews and question what this kind of people that writes that the movie is not good like to see or if they have difficulties to understand a story with many characters. My vote is seven.",/review/rw3719749/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2021,rws_20,4," Very lacklustre
","This one was very lacklustre, it has none of the magic of the previous four. Stuart Beattie (one of the three original script writers) is missing in this fifth instalment, and he must have played a very important part in the writing trio because the script in this one was terrible.",/review/rw3719749/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2017,petarmatic,8," Fun!
","I loved it! Yes, it is made for the family audiences but it really kept me going for two hours! It is an action filled adventure on the high seas from the times when Britannia ruled the waves. It has it all! Action, pirates, sailors, ghosts and what not, but it really is entertaining! You have no other option but to take your kids to this one, you will not be sorry.",/review/rw3719749/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2017,diac228,6," The Two Hour Continuity Error
","The Pirates franchise has been a bit of a doozy since it's shocking box office success way back in 2003. Curse of the Black Pearl was never meant to house a sequel, as it was an open-and-shut swashbuckler flick that was heavy on energy, action, humor, and blockbuster soul. It garnished tons of Oscar nominations (and money), upped Johnny Depp's persona several notches, and helped give Disney the box office crown in 2003. 14 years later we see the fifth installment, with the second consecutive attempt at creating a new Will/Elizabeth love story, the second consecutive attempt to replace the underrated director of the original trilogy Gore Verbinski, and once again taking the crown as arguably the most expensive film shoot in cinematic history.",/review/rw3719749/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2017,MichaelNontonMulu,8," Jack Sparrow Returns!
","Finally a Pirates of the Caribbean movie that I felt quite at par with the original one. I felt in this movie, the elements of entertainment were quite abundant. Unlike in the 4th installment, I think this one is funnier, more thrilling and gave the sense of happiness at the end. This time,, the movie was not solely telling the story of Jack Sparrow. Instead the other characters, especially Henry and Carina were given quite a lot screen time. It was nice to see Jack Sparrow's charm and wit plus his insistence of helping other people.",/review/rw3719749/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2017,jasonsharden,2," And There Will Be a 6th Film...
","I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but I certainly wasn't expecting it to not be entertaining. At least the previous films had great swashbuckling fun and wit. They told bizarre stories that had strange characters, all of which had something to offer to the film. The adventures were full of surprises, making them worth at least checking out, and Jack Sparrow was a character that was actually worth waiting for. This film had no personality. No heart. No passion. It was nothing more than a ""bottom of the barrel"" film with cheap sex jokes and physical gags, most of which were served by Jack Sparrow. He was drained of the spirit that he had in the previous films, and wasn't even worth the time he was on screen. Nobody cared, nobody tried, and the full theater was nearly emptied halfway through the film. What once was a film series known for their cinematic experiences, is now nothing more than a dried up corpse, a result of Disney's relentless need to milk their products to death.",/review/rw3719749/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2017,trevor-82944,3," It's Just Too Much
","We still remember the pleasant cinematic surprise from Pirates of the Caribbean, which took us on a fun adventure fit for the young at heart. When the sequel came out, we started to grow a little sick of it. By the third, it had overstayed its welcome. By the fourth, crap, I keep forgetting that a fourth one exists! Anyway, now we're on fifth, where a few good qualities, to our amazement, remained consistent these past fourteen years. It still sustains the same atmosphere, like watching a product of the 2000's. Depp has still got it with his iconic performance, Geoffrey Rush still graces the screen, and best of all, Hans Zimmer's famous score sounds fresher than ever.",/review/rw3719749/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2017,theVade,5," A mediocre film from a dying series of great films.
","Sadly, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales was just a mediocre film from a dying series of great films, and this film honestly brings nothing new to the table for this series. In a time full of cinematic universes, and unnecessary reboots, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales doesn't do anything special to wow audiences like it originally did almost 15 years ago. The film was full of mediocre acting, writing, visuals, and music, and is a film that will honestly just end up being forgotten like the film that came before it. In the end I decided to give Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales an ""Alright"" on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10. It's heartbreaking to say, but I have to agree with what Mark Kennedy from the Associated Press said about this film. ""After this fifth episode, you'll wish Disney would just declare the franchise dead and tell no more tales.""",/review/rw3719749/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2017,will-40-625067,1," Oh My God I Am So Effing Disappointed I Cannot Believe What I Have Just Seen
","(Gonna try not to cuss) I will start by saying I was/am fanatical about all three of the first ones. Yes the original is still the best, but the second is almost every damn bit as good. The plot was creative enough that it felt necessary, the writing was on par with the first, and Davy Jones is SO freaking good oh my god he is literally my favorite villain of all time (save for Agent Smith). The third one has its flaws (though I really can't think of any besides Keira Knightley's acting being occasionally over the top), but as a whole it's a WONDERFUL movie. Like sweet Jesus, Hans Zimmer's freaking score for that movie alone is goddamn legendary. And as a result I totally bought into the romance between Will & Elizabeth and really just felt an emotional connection to the whole series because of it (much like the emotion Howard Shore's music invokes for LotR). But what makes the third one so impressive is how well it handles ALL of that crazy plot while still introducing great new sh*t like the Brethren Court. ",/review/rw3719749/?ref_=tt_urv

29 May 2017,jeannefrancoise,8," Have fun with the pirates and Johny Depp is still the soul
","Dear readers, Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie that I have been watching since my high school. Now I am already in the working life, but the spirit of that movie series is still on my heart, so that yesterday I watched it. Since last year, I know that there will be a continuity of that movie, but I never knew that the movie is about Revenge, well yes, finally about Revenge. Before I am telling to you my review, it is important to remember that each movie of Pirates of Caribbean movie, includes an unique plot within it, for example the last adventure is about Family, and then the others are about Love, Friendship, Father-Son relation, and Captain-Crew honesty. In this latest movie of Pirates of the Caribbean, it is about Revenge, but do not hesitate to watch it, because the plot is designed not to show up about the Revenge itself, but there are legend, myth, Science, Witch, fantasy, history of Bank, ethical Law of pirates, and of course ridiculous adventure are around the plot, from the beginning to the end. I can guarantee you that you will be laughing of many funny actions or languages, and sometimes you do not care about the end, what you really care is that the safety of the soul of this movie: That is Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, Johny Depp is still the soul of the movie. He is leading all characters and he is the one who is making this adventure happens. Besides of its perfect, this movie has some illogical scenes and some missing plots, so that for those who are not really fan of Pirates of the Caribbean movies, will not really understand who is the real enemy and what pirates stake of life in that kind of level to protect Captain Jack Sparrow. Well, there must be a betrayal, but this movie never betray you to give a lot of have fun!!",/review/rw3719749/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2017,Special-K88,," a retread of its origins
","Five winters after On Stranger Tides, some of the same key characters (and a few new ones) return for this latest high seas adventure. Callow sailor Henry Turner is on a personal mission to retrieve the Trident of Poseidon, a powerful artifact thought by many to be a myth. In the course of his journey he crosses paths—and eventually aligns himself with—wanted pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, and ambitious astronomer Carina Smyth. The mission is further complicated when they run afoul of Sparrow's 'frenemy' Captain Barbossa, and learn that a gang of undead sailors are coming their way. Follows essentially the same formula as The Curse of the Black Pearl, but the characters lack charisma (even Depp seems curiously subdued), the story is never really engaging, and all the rip-roaring action scenes and special effects can only carry this uninspired journey so far. Bardem effectively sneers and snarls as Captain Salazar, but he's one of the few highlights in an otherwise forgettable entry. **",/review/rw3719749/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2017,n-kefala,4," Pirates of the boring
","Johnny Depp returns to the big screen as the iconic Jack Sparrow in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales."" A cartoon like Depp and a boring plot sends this fifth ""Pirates"" to the bottom. It has a few thrilling action sequences, but it's often loud and dumb and most unfortunately, lacks the wit and fun that made the first Pirates of the Caribbean so entertaining. Oscar winners Geoffrey Rush and Javier Bardem do their best but they can't save this ship from drawing. It's fine for a bit, but then you realize that you've seen all of these things before, and they aren't getting any fresher. If there was ever a point of time where this franchise would permanently end, now is the right moment.",/review/rw3719749/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2017,danielharden,3," A Jar of Dirt
","Remember when Johnny Depp exploded onto the big screen as Jack Sparo- Sorry, CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow, and it was awesome? Ah the good old days, what I would give to go back to that time where Pirates were cool and Salazar's Revenge didn't exist. The fifth instalment to the Pirates franchise displays a complete evolution of genre complying with Louis Giannetti's theory. The Cure of the Black Pearl marked the Primitive genre stage, the film blew audiences away and introduced them to the pirates genre. Dead Man's Chest marked the classical stage, classical conventions were utilised such as the Kraken and what have you. Next is the Revisionist stage of At World's End with it's time travel, witches that grow into giants and that sinkhole final act, let's just ignore the pointless fourth film aaaaaaaaaand now, unfortunately, we have the all out parody that is Salazar's revenge.",/review/rw3719749/?ref_=tt_urv
