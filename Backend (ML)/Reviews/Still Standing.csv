24 December 2022,DiCaprioFan13,10," One of the most underrated shows of all-time!
","Friday Night Lights is one of all-time favorite shows. It's is so criminally underrated it's ridiculous! It is just an absolute amazing show! The show is based off the book and the film but is so much better than even those two. It takes place in the small Texas town of Dillon, Texas and takes place at one of the best football high schools...the Dillon Panthers. Coach Taylor (Kyle Chandler) leads the team through pressure filled seasons full of expectations and helps his players both on and off the field. He also has to deal with the everyday struggles of his own family. Even though the football story line is great, it is so much more than that. If you read the reviews you'll see 90% of them are 9's & 10's and most have one thing in common and that's that they didn't give it a chance until years after it went off the air. Once you start watching you can't stop!",/review/rw8295537/?ref_=tt_urv

","I can't find a strong enough word in my vocabulary to describe how spectacular and engrossing this show is. I remember when I first heard about it eight or so years ago when the show premiered. To be honest, after seeing the movie, I thought it would be cheesy and not all that good. After Breaking Bad ended, I needed a new show to watch and while searching for the best shows available on Netflix streaming, this was near the top of the list. And I can truly say even after watching something as incredible as Breaking Bad, I think this show is almost more special in its own way. It doesn't need violence and drugs to be entertaining. I remember right after watching the pilot, I couldn't stop and stayed up till 7 am watching. It will pull you in that quickly, especially if you are a football fan. Not that you cant watch it if you don't like football or don't know much about it. I absolutely love football. Love watching it and played it in high school. But football is absolutely the least interesting aspect of this show. The first episode of the series goes through each day leading up to the first game of the season. After watching it I thought every episode would be that way. But after seeing the end of the pilot I realized the show is about much much more than just football. Football is just a backdrop.",/review/rw8295537/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2022,brett-76260,10," Simply the best
","Probably one of the best all around shows Ive ever watched. I grew up in Dallas so this really brings back some great memories of high school football. This show captures everything Texas and is such a good show. Don't worry It's not just about high school football and it touches on so many subjects I won't try and list them out. One thing is for sure though, I guarantee you will experience every emotion a human being can go through during the course of this series. If high school football is not your thing it won't matter. The writing, the directing, the music and above all the acting, will take you places no other show will take you. Yeah it's that good. Just Give it 3 episodes before you make any decisions. It takes that long to get to know the characters and get familiar with the show. When it's all over and you finish the last episode, you will sit back and say to yourself, ""crap that just might be the best series I've ever watched""... You will have Clear Eyes and Full Hearts... watch the show and you will never forget that phrase... Peter Berg well done on this one!!!",/review/rw8295537/?ref_=tt_urv

27 August 2022,CoopertheBeagle,9," One of the great American TV shows
","Must watch if you like a feel good drama with good character development. Like these creators' other shows , including Parenthood and This is Us, it's very heartfelt. If you're like me and you don't especially care about sports, that won't hamper your enjoyment of this show. If you're at all skeptical, give the first episode a try and you'll surely be sucked into the human drama by the end of episode 1. The character development is so subtle and nuanced, many characters go from what seem like tropes to fully fleshed out beloved characters. Many of the young people on the show give performances that don't seem to have been matched by anything they've appeared in since. Britton and Chandler of course shine as the central couple of the show, whose love shines through all the ups and downs. They have a witty repartee that forms a major part of the show's appeal. Jesse Plemons moves from a side character to a central part of the show. You can see why he's emerged as such a big star since.",/review/rw8295537/?ref_=tt_urv

4 July 2010,coop-16,," one of the finest shows, ever
","I only recently became hooked on this show, having obsessed for perhaps too long about a certain metaphysical fantasy set on a desert island and about a certain stylish melodrama about one man's Mafia family. This show has no gangland hits, no sixties nostalgia about Madison Avenue, no housewives( or chemistry teachers) dealing drugs, no musical numbers,no recondite references to Egyptian hieroglyphics or quantum physics. Yet despite all these terrible flaws,( clever sarcasm) it is a masterpiece. I am not anti-Lost. I enjoyed the show immensely, for all its flaws. However, this show is , in some ways, superior. It is, in fact a photo-realistic picture of life in a small town in Texas, beautifully written and wonderfully acted. I rank it with certain other shows that were overlooked and are now sadly forgotten by all but a few people with good taste: The Call To Glory, Homefront, and I'll Fly Away,among others. In some ways, this is a show worthy of the golden age of TV ""sooial drama"", Naked City, The Defenders, Mr. Novak, Ben Casey, The Fugitive( a social commentary disguised as a thriller), Route 66, Slattery's People and East Side West Side. Like the best episodes of those shows, Friday Night Lights offers more questions than answers. This show is one of the best ever. I pray to a sometimes enigmatic providence that it does not perish from the airwaves.",/review/rw8295537/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,buckwinthrop-16041,10," Absolutely Phenomenal
","I'm currently binging Friday Night Lights a second time. I fondly recall how outstanding it was during its initial run. Now, over a decade later I find that its actually better. Quite simply, Friday Night Lights is one of the greatest TV shows of all time. Its like watching real people in their real lives. You care about them. They're like friends. The writing, direction and acting pull at every emotion. Peter Berg the creator is a genius. Coming back to revisit this incredible show is like coming home. To relive you're best childhood experiences. A big shout to Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton.",/review/rw8295537/?ref_=tt_urv

","Simply put, this is reality. If someone had affixed a camera to my head, 24 hours a day, when I was in high school, you couldn't have gotten a better picture of life. I know someone like every single character in this show. The story lines, the acting, the cast, couldn't be any better in this show. For those who haven't made it to high school yet, in Texas, this is your future. Wonderful, wonderful drama. I didn't even hear about this show (don't have time for much TV) until season 4. Watched one episode and I was hooked. Went out and bought every episode and sat down and watched every one in about two days. Didn't want to turn it off. I had always thought that The Shield was the best show ever on TV....until I was introduced to this tremendous story about life.",/review/rw8295537/?ref_=tt_urv

",It's 2022 and I overheard someone mention this show and how good it is. They are not wrong. All the characters are so rich in complexity. But out of all the characters the scenes between Matt Saracen and his grandmother leave me choking back tears. Highly recommend this series. It's beautiful.,/review/rw8295537/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm a CA boy that has lived in Abilene, Texas & Houston Texas & I loved it. The people are the friendliest in the world. It's affordable. The weather takes getting used to but at least the people there still honor God & America! Football is a 2nd religion to them and they take it seriously. If you don't like the show, even though it is the most closest to reality I've ever seen, don't watch it. If you don't like Texas don't visit or live there! They respect your rights now please respect theirs! FNL is one of my top 5 shows ever! The theme song hits me somewhere in my soul that longs for a simple, normal life with normal people!

2 January 2021,cscott2331,10," Great show. So real!
","I'm finishing up. Was down with a knee surgery and needed something that wasn't too dark and depressing. This is a damn good show. I hate Lila though. She's is awful. Unlikeable in every single way. Tyra has shown she can act through it all. Mean, sad, scared, funny and tough. She nailed them all. Lila is just a whiny baby, and every situation is acted out the same. That disgusting fake sweet voice and talking through her teeth. Jason Street should've stayed while Lila went. He was for sure one of my favorites. Tim is one of the main reasons to keep watching. He's nice to look at and can actually act! Buddy is fat and greasy and sweaty but plays his role well! Coach and Mrs T are likable and real. Cant imagine anyone playing those roles better. Matt, well we all know a Matt. Reliable, sweet, artsy and without much confidence. Landry (pre psycho Todd from breaking bad, had no clue he was in it)was amazing! Smash redeemed himself and I was happy he was around and I LOVE his momma. Man, she was so believable in her role. Maybe a bit too much drinking and screwing for 15 year olds they could've at least held off until they were a bit older. but a damn good show! Just like in high school EVERYTHING is a cross to die on. And just like in a small town football takes precedent over EVERYTHING! Grades, kids, money you name it. Football is their only reason to wake up each day and only means of survival for many. In my town our football coach gets triple what any teacher does. It's really sad actually. So this show is very real, beautifully shot, produced like none other and just about perfect. Except for that winey ass minka Kelly. I know now why she never made it past this and others did. She was cast for her look and looks alone and they just didn't take her far enough. Not against these heavy hitters! All in all a really good drama, really good show. One that will get you in the feels on almost every episode. Glad I finally decided to watch it. And glad they didn't drag it out 10 years! So many shows drag out and end up sucking as a result...not this one.",/review/rw8295537/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2017,ElessarAndurilS,10," Best show I never heard of. Solid End!
","Friday Night Lights sat on my Netflix watch list for over a year before I gave it a chance. What a shock! I'm expecting a show about a football coach and a lot of game clips, instead I am quickly introduced to one of the best family drama's of excellent quality I've ever watched! Rare to see a positive drama in any context in recent years, yet this show portrays a loving couple and their family standing up for what is right in the face of a HIGHLY DYSFUNCTIONAL town with many dysfunctional people. But the story grows, and transitions in such an excellent way (excluding the abrupt end to season 2 I wasn't expecting - cut short by writers strike in 2008) the writing and story are excellent. Was casting 25 year old people as high school students a bit much, yes, but not uncommon... and when doing so to portray exceptional high school athletes; I totally get it, some of these high school football players DO LOOK 25 and they needed actors to look and play the part. Makes me give that a bye, along with the exceptionally pretty girls as that is also common practice.",/review/rw8295537/?ref_=tt_urv

","I can hardly think of another show with a better cast, the range of emotions and really a perfect ending. Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton lead and become something any married couple should long to be. Nothing is perfect or always easy but you get to see the growth of so many of the characters throughout. You'll laugh out loud. You'll yell and scream. You'll get so angry you'll want to stop watching (The McCoy's, y'all?) but you will come back for more because you just have to know that things all work out. It's not about football. It's about family and cherished moments.",/review/rw8295537/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2022,rogersreagane,10," Reagan Rogers- Review
","My whole life I have been around football. My dad being a coach has led me to experience many different things firsthand that many people do not get to have in their lives. Going to many football games, getting VIP access into certain parts of the stadium, and traveling to watch games for free even are just a few of the many experiences that I have had over the past almost eighteen years. Football has always been a major part of my life for a long time now and it has led me to watch many different films, including the show Friday Night Lights. It's about this football team out of Dillon, Texas, and the lives of each kid, coach, and student that either plays or goes to Dillon Highschool. It shows how this team because Dillon is such a small town, is what this town is centered around. The Panther football team is what Dillon lives, breathes, and sleeps each and every day. It's very clear that football is a major lifestyle in this town, kind of like how football is a big deal in my life.",/review/rw8295537/?ref_=tt_urv

I'm really glad that he won an Emmy for his role on ""Friday Night Lights"" as ""Coach Taylor"". Recently I started to watch ""Friday Night Lights"" and I just want to say that this is one of the best drama series that I've seen (and believe me when I say this 'cause I've watched lots of series)! It has every aspects of a real life story and it involves the viewer with the lives of all the characters. I wasn't a fan of American football before I watched this drama, but now I really enjoy watching football games.
