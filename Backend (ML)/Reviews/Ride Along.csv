24 November 2022,Biswas_,9," A remake that retains its own identity
","I have already seen the original 2021 Drishyam 2 hence while watching the Hindi remake, i knew what was coming. Still i watched it to see what changes the Hindi version makes to the original or is it just a blatant copy paste.",/review/rw8775374/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2022,Prashast_Singh,10," One of the best the year's finest thrillers.
","I might not have been able to experience the magic of Drishyam, one of the best crime thrillers from Bollywood even though a remake, on the big screen, but I was determined to experience the sequel in cinemas at any cost. Also, this was my first experience of a night show, and that too without wearing any masks as opposed to my previous cinema visits. And man, I was wowed. Drishyam 2 delivered nonstop entertainment and lived up to the expectations.",/review/rw8775374/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2022,cs_rahul_kumar,10," A Very Gripping and Intelligent Sequel With Perfect Twits and Turns !!!
","The sequel to Drishyam, which is adapted from a Malayalam thriller of the same name, begins where the 2015 film had left off-Vijay Salgaonkar (Ajay Devgn) emerging from a police station carrying a shovel. Seven years ago, the almost-perfect crime had a witness, and that's what gives the police impetus and ammo to revisit the Sameer Deshmukh missing-case investigation so many years later.",/review/rw8775374/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,milindsharma-53018,6," This Hindi remake destroyed the most important scene in the original Malayalam Drishyam 2 and rushes the best parts of the climax in the original.
","After watching the trailer of the hindi remake of Drishyam 2, I was excited to watch it even though I knew the twist after watching the original one starring Mohanlal.",/review/rw8775374/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2022,sarthakbharad-36851,10," there is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.
","Stepping into the theatre, it is natural for you to think, is there really the need of a sequel? Is it just gonna be another cash grab or there really is more story to tell which can match the complex narrative and high stakes of the first film which was so perfect in every way? Believe me, in the climax, you'll literally start clapping to the film's genius.",/review/rw8775374/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2022,manitverma,10," Wonderful Story
",Ajay Devgan delivers his first hit after debacles like Thank God and Runway 34. Nice selection of script he has probably done. Tabu as always gives a powerful and impactful performance after Bhool Bhulaiya 2. Like Part 1 the role she had done in part 2 it's awesome and better than part 1. Having a talented actor like Akshaye Khanna is what makes the film pull off in theatre's. Rajat Kapoor makes a brilliant comeback and performance again in Drishyam 2 unlike in part 1 he did. Saurabh Shukla delivers a good performance though his role could have been a little more. Overall full paisa vasool film go watch in theatres near you.,/review/rw8775374/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2022,usernamesoumya,10," One of the biggest plottwists for any world class level cinema
","Just came back from the theatre, I have no words to describe my inner excitement, and that ""Uffffff"" moment.... I would suggest, weak hearted people should avoid watching this movie. The plottwist was unexpected, and even after watching, you wouldn't believe. Screenplay, Direction, background music, heavy weight story, and acting everything was magnificent. I was at the edge of my seat, and the movie engaged me fully in the 2nd half. Though first half was a bit slow, but when the thrill started going high, chill went through my veins....... Undoubtedly, it was a world class level plot twist in the climax... ...",/review/rw8775374/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2023,eldreddsouza,6," Just ok...
","Keeping it short, I just didn't enjoy this movie as much as I hoped i would. I've watched the Malayalam Dhrishyam 2 several times. Despite knowing the suspense that too. It's because the film apart from its strong story was also technically brilliant. Also the chemistry between its cast members was impeccable. That family looked like a legit family and Mohanlal and his wife looked like a traditional Indian couple. Absolutely flawless chemistry. Same thing unfortunately can't be said about this Hindi remake. There was zero chemistry here. Also the kids were forgettable unlike the original where you will clearly remember the kids in the family.",/review/rw8775374/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2022,critiquerimdb,6," Not airtight but worth watching
","Sequel to the much raved about Drishyam, Drishyam 2 redefines what it means to make a sequel. Bare minimum, yes, but in this age of constantly degrading depth and meaning in Bollywood, where sequels are nothing but a way to capitalise on the brand of a successful film, this is a heartening sight. That doesn't absolve Drishyam 2 of its flaws, though.",/review/rw8775374/?ref_=tt_urv
