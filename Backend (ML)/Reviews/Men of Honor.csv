27 February 2017,zkonedog,8," Incredible Acting & Emotion Covers Up Almost All Faults
","Based strictly on content, ""Fathers & Daughters"" is not the type of movie I would usually see. However, after watching the trailer and seeing the star power of Russell Crowe, Amanda Seyfried, and Aaron Paul, I decided to give it a try. While the plot of this film can be a bit shaky at times, one almost doesn't realize it because the quality of the acting invokes such strong emotions all the way through.",/review/rw7020822/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2016,cosmo_tiger,8," Emotionally powerful & gripping. Crowe and Seyfired give the best performances of their career. I highly recommend it.
","""That's what this book is really about, it's about me."" Jake Davis (Crowe) is a famous author who as just lost his wife and now he is in a fight to keep his daughter Katie (Seyfried). While trying to write a book that hill become a best seller he is trying to pay off lawyers in order to keep his wife's sister from taking his girl. Katie, all grown up now, is struggling to maintain a normal relationship. One of the books her father wrote as an impact on both their lives. This is a fantastic movie, and also one of the most emotional films I have seen in a long time. It may be because I am a father myself but I really got emotionally invested in this and found myself holding back tears over and over. Crowe does a perfect job of trying to balance being a father with trying to do everything he can to save his girl. Seyfried gives maybe the best performance she has ever given and is very believable as someone who has lost her way and doesn't know how to be happy and ""normal"". This is a movie I could go on and on about but I will just say watch this and you will feel the same way I did. Overall, emotionally powerful and gripping. Crowe and Seyfired give the best performances of their career. I highly recommend this, but be ready to cry. I give this an A-.",/review/rw7020822/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2015,ipekmine,8," A beautiful tear-jerker
","Fathers And Daughters: A movie that would have made me book the first flight home without waiting for holidays if I still lived overseas. I mean it. Yes, I'm a ""daddy's girl"", and I've been lucky enough to enjoy this beautiful movie with my father (well, my mum and brother were there too, but dad was a 'must' from what I'd heard about the film). As one can easily guess after seeing the trailer, it's a touching piece, and the cast does a great job in reflecting the story on screen. Gabriele Muccino delivers the plot with a non-clich√© flow, he's very successful with the flashbacks, and one of the strongest aspects of F & D is the amazingly beautiful music, in my opinion. Particularly the Carpenter's cover by Michael Bolton, Close To You adds so much, not to mention that it squeezes your heart during a particular scene. Speaking of heart-squeezing, I think Russell Crowe has made a habit of making his audience cry, especially with The Water Diviner and now, with Fathers and Daughters. As expected, he does not just act, he 'becomes' Jake Davis, and forms multiple lumps in your throat with the character he portrays. As one of the best actors of our time, if not the very best, he's simply amazing. Also, the chemistry between R. Crowe and Kylie Anne Rogers is great, it's heart-warming and so 'real', if I may say so. Kylie Anne is the sweetest potato chip, that goes without saying, and I need to add that at some point I did hate Bruce Greenwood and Diane Kruger.. well, not them, but the characters they played, of course. Needless to say, Jane Fonda was one of the shining stars of F & D, and I think Amanda Seyfried and Aaron Paul were well-chosen for their respective roles, *thumbs up* to them both. Taken together, I loved the story, it was beautifully transformed into a tear-jerker on screen, and I sincerely hope this movie gets released in every country -because it's a sweet piece of art which reminds you of the most important and valuable things in life. PS: Keep tissues nearby when you're seeing F & D. Am not kidding.",/review/rw7020822/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2016,phd_travel,8," Stellar cast elevates this drama
",I enjoyed this drama. There is nothing very new about the story and it  is predictable but in good way and you just want to see this stellar  cast act it out.  25 years ago a father and daughter cope after the mother is killed in a  car accident. The mother's sister played by a beautiful and very classy  looking Diane Kruger and her slimy husband played by Bruce Greenwood  (remember the nasty guy in Double Jeopardy? In present day the daughter  grown up as a social worker has commitment and promiscuity issues.  There is story isn't very ground breaking but with such a starry cast  and an actual story with actual drama tragedy romance love infidelity  forgiveness it makes a compelling watch. Some people may find things  old fashioned and soapy - but I think that is unfair. There is nothing  wrong with having a proper resolved complete story for a change.  Russell Crowe is a bit old to be father to the young girl but he acts  well - his seizures are convincing. Amanda looks prettier and more  alluring and less bug eyed than usual. She makes a potentially  unlikeable character sympathetic. It's great to see Aaron Paul him in a  romantic role as her love interest. There was an indication in  'Breaking Bad' of how affecting his passion would be in a role like  this. Jane Fonda is well cast as a publisher.  Overall the cast is great and elevates this beyond a Nicholas Sparks  level.  Tip: The story is old over 2 time periods about 25 years apart and  going back and forth between them. Flashbacks: Don't get confused - the  flashbacks are when Russel Crowe appears.,/review/rw7020822/?ref_=tt_urv

","After his wife's death, Russell Crowe can't cope with being a single father. He may be a beloved successful writer, but he has deep psychological problems. Twenty-five years later, his daughter Amanda Seyfried is getting her masters in psychology and volunteering at a children's center. The film cuts back and forth between the past and the present, and while normally I don't like those types of movies, Fathers & Daughters is an exception.",/review/rw7020822/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2016,Semi_Sweet,7," The performances really hold this one together.
","If you come away praising only one thing from this movie, I'd be willing to bet that it would be Kylie Rogers' performance as Russell Crowe's young daughter. She gives a genuinely affecting performance for a girl her age and although Crowe himself needs no help here as he puts in a brilliant showing of his own, he's all the better for her presence. They played off each other so well and the film was much more enjoyable whenever they shared the screen. Amanda Seyfried was her dependable self but this kind of role is easily within her wheelhouse so don't expect to be blown away by her.",/review/rw7020822/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2016,amandataylor-03790,6," Have your tissues handy
","Fathers and Daughters is an entertaining film that at many times will have you reaching for the tissue box. The film mainly revolves around Katie a young woman who struggles to form any real relationships in her life. The film moves between her childhood to present day throughout the film. Some movie goers find this annoying, however I thought this added to the film and was done well. On the downside, there were times when some scenes didn't need to be there and this resulted in the film ending rather abruptly instead of exploring deeper issues which I feel viewers would have responded well too. Overall, a good watch but not a 'must see'.",/review/rw7020822/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2016,Robert_duder,7," Slow and subtle yes but an emotions driven drama that impresses
","I was surprised to find this film as I'd never heard of it before and even more surprised that IMDb critics were so hard on it. It's actually a very real, hard hitting, emotional drama about a father and daughter about how the father's emotional turmoil effect his daughter. It's coming of age and it's circle of life and it can be dissected in many ways and leave questions in your mind but it's also simple and straight forward. The performances are strong and often heart wrenching but the film is subtle in the way that it is short and paced. I didn't find it boring at all, quite the contrary I found it fascinating and yet you are left struggling to understand what happens between the childhood of this little girl and the emotionally disturbed woman she becomes. I think it may be more powerful to some people than others if they find some sort of connection to themselves in it whether it be an emotional problem or a similarity to a character in the film. The film lives and breathes morals about mental illness and for that I give it kudos and the cast did a terrific job.",/review/rw7020822/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2018,alanbenfieldjr,4," Seizures and Tears
","Okay I got it. Director Muccino must have found a profitable vein and he's exploiting it in a rather shameless fashion. The script, very much like in ""Summertime"" ""The Pursuit Of Happiness"" and ""Seven Pounds"" is an expositional tear jerker with characters who explain themselves with every line of dialogue. 
Russell Crowe has his first seizure within the first few minutes of the film and then he has others, I don't know how many but it felt like 400. So at the end we have a 2 hour movie out of a tiny idea swollen by an infinite series of cliches that includes, I'm not kidding, a musical, romantic montage when the young lovers first meet. The extraordinary Janet McTeer has one scene and the extraordinary Jane Fonda, one or two. So this must have been an expensive production and in fact Fathers and Daughters has everything , cast, looks, settings, everything except real thought and original ideas.",/review/rw7020822/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2016,leonblackwood,4," Crowe is brilliant but the storyline is poor. 4/10
","Review: This movie started off quite good and Russell Crowe's performance was brilliant but I got quite bored after a while and the whole back and forth into time element, started to get on my nerves. The ending was also pretty weak and I personally didn't think that it had to be 2 hours long. I did love the chemistry between Jake Davis (Russell Crowe) and his young daughter Katie (Kylie Rogers), and the emotional beginning did touch me but I lost interest in the older Katie (Amanda Seyfried) storyline. Her relationship with Cameron (Aaron Paul) was doomed from the start, because she kept on randomly sleeping with anyone she could get her hands on. With that aside, Crowe was truly brilliant in this movie, and when he was having seizures, it really did look real. After losing his wife in a fatal car crash, while Jake was driving with Katie in the back of the car, the successful writer becomes depressed and suffers with seizures, which are uncontrollable. His doctor suggests that he should be hospitalised for a while because the car crash had obviously taken a toll on his life, so he sends Katie to live with her aunt Elizabeth (Diane Kruger) and her husband William (Bruce Greenwood). After 7 months in hospital, he is finally released, and he attempts to get his daughter back, which upsets Elizabeth and William who have grown close to the little girl. They try to gain custody, because Jake is running out of money and it still pretty unwell but Jakes lawyers manage to find out some information about William, which makes them drop the case. The movie then jumps in time and shows Katie later on in life, struggling to hold down a relationship and helping a young girl who is battling with her past. After sleeping with many men, Katie finally settles down with Cameron but she still finds it hard to to fully commit. There is a big gap in the film, so you don't get to see Katie through her teenage years but you do get to see how the relationship with her father has taken its toll in her latter years. The concept actually wasn't bad but it seemed like it was going on forever. Jane Fonda, who plays Jakes agent, should have had a bigger role in the film and the time periods became a bit confusing after a while. When the whole film comes together at the end, I didn't really get the moral of the story but it's still a watchable film because of it's emotional content. Watchable!",/review/rw7020822/?ref_=tt_urv

27 June 2016,kraljevic411,10," Exceptional story of not giving up
","This movie really got me thinking about what priorities are in life. It got me pretty emotional too because I've identified myself in Katie but in Jake as well. It's hard filling up the void inside yourself and you do wrong actions to make it right. You know so well it's wrong but there's nothing you can do about it, you have to live with it until you figure out your whole life, literally. Everyone's got their own ways of dealing and avoiding but they are rarely working. We don't see help coming right at us because we are too occupied with our problems, that's what makes things worse. When we manage to confront ourselves, we realize that we have been missing out great things that were surrounding us the whole time but we were unable to see it. I love it how the movie has bigger meaning and a real impact on my standings. I realize how selfish we are (including myself) for not cherishing the moments we have, just like Jake did, because you never know when it will be over.",/review/rw7020822/?ref_=tt_urv

It was not like all about the happy scenarios, but it began with a tragedy and then moved to narrate a father who struggles to provide a better life for her daughter when his health was getting worse every day. In another layer, the story focused on the grown up daughter who struggles as well, but to get close to the people which affected since her childhood days with her father.",/review/rw7020822/?ref_=tt_urv
