11 May 2021,richard_rossi,10," Every saint was once a sinner, and every sinner can become a saint.
","A beautiful work of art with strong performances and great visuals about Saint Nektarios of Aegina by talented director, Yelena Popovic. It captures the man who lived in a skin of real flesh and the battles he faced on his way to holiness. Every saint was once a sinner, and every sinner can become a saint. He faced the hatred of men and spiritual warfare. Sometimes the greater the anointing, the greater the accusation. A great performance by Mickey Rourke as a paralyzed man who receives miraculous grace. A must-see!",/review/rw7354437/?ref_=tt_urv

1 April 2022,elenipnyc,10," In a society with no social safety net, Saint Nektarios saved lives.
","I avoided this film when I was in Greece because of a bad review in Athinorama. The reviewer took exception with Writer/Director Yelena Popovic's choice to only briefly cover the intrigues that led to Saint Nektarios's expulsion from Alexandria. Now that I have seen the film, I disagree. It was a good movie that reminded me of the 2006 film ""The Island"" directed by Pavel Lungin. In a society with no social safety net, Saint Nektarios saved lives. Hostility towards the poor in that era (think 1890-1920) was even worse than it is now. Political intrigue would take the film in an entirely different direction.",/review/rw7354437/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2021,ltattoo,10," Spiritually transformative
","The acting, script, music were superb, but there was much more to this film. I felt myself uplifted and chastened, made whole again and again. So many lines to remember. Here is one: ""Woe to me if my faith depends on men."" I highly recommend this spiritually and emotionally powerful film.",/review/rw7354437/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2021,cleochris,7," The heartbreaking story of a holy man
","Beautiful movie, about a person who was the incarnation of the teaching of Christ. Aris Servetalis was perfect as Agios Nectarios. His performance was astouning and very persuasive. Other actors that I think also stood out, were Christos Loulis, as the President of Risario School, Alexander Petrov as Kostas and Karyofyllia Karabeti as the mother of Maria (Tonia Sotiropoulou), even though she appeared in three scenes only!",/review/rw7354437/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2021,bouldasgiorgos,8," A movie beyond just religion
","A great iteration of St Nektarios' life. I found the movie enjoyable. The directing and cinematography were very good most of the time and so was the acting, which clearly lacked because of the non-native language spoken by most of the actors. What I almost didn't notice at first but grew on me during the runtime was the soundtrack. It really adds to many parts of the movie The plot, although simple and without an actual ""target"", kept me engaged from start to finish and made me think and realise things.",/review/rw7354437/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2022,fntagin,6," I really wanted to like it
","I am a religious man and i really wanted to like the movie! But for my disappointment the edit and the presentation was all over the place! No actual background for any character! Even for Saint Nektarios i couldn't believe how shallow his presentation was. I was trying to feel his injustice, his slander but there is a disconnection to the actual character and the audience. I have read St. Nektarios story and i was remembering things to fill the gaps! Jumping from scene to scene in a hurry to tell us the story of St. Nektarios without actually telling the story! The actors were good don't get me wrong! The problem is definitely with the directing and the editing! Sorry if i sound harsh but the epicenter should be the character of Saint Nektarios, his background and not to just tell his story!",/review/rw7354437/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2021,nina-95083,10," A film that touches the depth of the heart
","This film offers a peek into the potential each one of us has for our lives. Saint Nectarios is a universal man, his kindness and truth speak to all, not just to Orthodox Christians. Watching this movie took me on a journey and a reflection about power, purpose, faith and surrender. It is a gift for our times when so much of the focus of humanity is towards external success, watching this saintly man turn away from fame and power, over and over again. I walked away with a deep sense of what it would be like to know and embody true peace, a peace that nobody can take away.",/review/rw7354437/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2021,kosmasp,7," Holier than thou
","First things first, because Mickey Rourke is still the first name that pops up here and apparently the trailer also seems to give the impression he is in this ... a lot. He isn't - he may have a pivotal role of sorts (as other side characters have), but his screen presense may be around 2 minutes.",/review/rw7354437/?ref_=tt_urv

1 September 2021,superchristinaki,5," Overtrying doesn't always help
","I'm not quite sure what to write about this one since I didn't like it, but I see there are people who really liked it and that's how it always is of course. From my point of view, the weak points of the movie are: the language (which is in English in order to be more accessible to the international audience, but it sounds weird and unreal for the actors who play and for the story itself), the (conventional) choice of some actors that either acted too much or they didn't fit for the role given, and the collaboration of script and direction that didn't emphasize or highlight the true actions of the protagonist Saint Nectarios. The narration visually felt a bit flat while there was a lot of talking.",/review/rw7354437/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was a very good movie that hasnt been promoted. Happened to see that it was playing in theater 10. Went to buy a ticket and the movie wasnt listed as a movie to buy tickets for. Had to speak to manager in order purchase ticket. Went to movie theater website and it was conveniently not listed there either. Very curious and not surprising that hollywood would ""ghost"" a postive Religious movie documentary. Shameful. Will buy multiple dvds to send to friends and family to watch and enjoy. No wonder no one watches oscars or any other hollywood dreck.",/review/rw7354437/?ref_=tt_urv

",The visuals of this movie are wonderful. The acting was firm but the plot did have some gaps that Yelena could've elaborated on more. The film was quite repetitive and on the other hand was extremely compelling in some parts. It is an emotional rollercoaster. Highly recommend this film for anyone who wants to have a taste of greece.,/review/rw7354437/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2022,lydiakaragiannopoulou,4," The subject it doesn't make a movie automatically good!!
","The direction made me feel the movie was on a auto pilot without emotion ,without soul without vision..the actors struggling with English accent in a level I found it funny in some parts.in my opinion the film is trying to proselytize in such an obvious way..I ended up not being interested for any of the characters with the last drop the performance of the main actor Agios Nektarios who seed more bored ,without soul and personality than a peaceful priest. A waste chance to make a very interesting movie but I am sure I will sell many tickets just because of the theme..",/review/rw7354437/?ref_=tt_urv
