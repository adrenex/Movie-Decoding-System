5 January 2017,Hitchcoc,9," Superb Performance...Incredible Casting
","I totally agree with several before me that at some point in the film, one forgets he is watching Val Kilmer play the late Jim Morrison. This is a marvelous performance by a gifted actor. His physical appearance and voice really capture the essence of one of the top five or six rock bands ever. There is lots of documentary footage of the doors because they came along when videotaping and filming were everywhere, so to capture a realistic display of performances in a film had too be good. We get to watch the guys slowly evolve. We get to see how Morrison held sway over the group. Ray Manzarek had an incredible talent of his own, and yet he kept being dwarfed by the charismatic lead singer. There were times when Morrison's performances were almost transcendent. The music is really good here as well.",/review/rw2979160/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2004,Manthorpe,9," The Lizard King
","We all know how legendary The Doors were and still are, and sooner or later someone was going to make a film about them. Might as well be Oliver Stone. Given the subject matter, Stone was able to go off the deep end with his imagery here to the point of making one have an epileptic seizure OR think they just dropped some acid. Either way, it's great to watch in my book.",/review/rw2979160/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am a 17 year old student who is just getting into the amazing band that is the Doors. I watched the movie knowing about how Oliver Stone skewed the facts and changed some things around, so instead of expecting a 100% factual biography on Jim Morrison, I watched it expecting an entertaining film with great music...That's what I got.",/review/rw2979160/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2013,namashi_1,10," Val Kilmer At His Finest!
","A biopic about the 1960-70s rock band of the same name which emphasizes the life of its late lead singer, Jim Morrison, 'The Doors' proves to be a showcase for the under-rated Val Kilmer. As Jim Morrison, Kilmer delivers a knockout performance, that deserved an Oscar Nod, if not a Win.",/review/rw2979160/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2006,hall895,6," An ordinary film with one extraordinary performance
","Watching Oliver Stone's The Doors can be at times a frustrating experience. Considering the central figure in the film is pretty much always drunk or stoned or both the entire plot seems to unfold in a bit of a haze. Those watching the film may come away feeling a little stoned themselves. Yet through the drug and alcohol-fueled haze this film does have a lot to recommend it. Most notably it has one of the most stunningly brilliant acting performances you could ever hope to see. Val Kilmer, playing Jim Morrison, is simply perfect in the role. It sounds clich√©d but Kilmer really seems to become Morrison. The physical resemblance is eerie and their voices are so similar it is fairly impossible when listening to the film's soundtrack to figure out when exactly you're hearing Morrison and when you're hearing Kilmer. Tracing Morrison's journey from shy, reserved youth to manic, drugged-out rock god the performance by Kilmer is mesmerizing throughout.",/review/rw2979160/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2003,Quinoa1984,10," ""Nothing to touch the earth, not to see the sun, nothing left to do but run, run, run, let's run.""
","This is just a sampling of the lyrics that singer/writer Jim Morrison contributed to his group The Doors, and just this, as part of his epic piece ""The Celebration of the Lizard"" shows his skill as a master of the written word. He is shown in Oliver Stone's The Doors as a shy, though often obnoxious and crude, persona who self describes himself in one scene: ""I think of myself as a sensitive, intelligent human being, but with the soul of a clown that forces me to blow it at the most crucial of moments."" He may have blown it in the end, but it makes for a fascinating story.",/review/rw2979160/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2006,Lechuguilla,," Mr. Mojo Risin And The Turbulent 60s
","Although less popular now, Jim Morrison was an American pop culture icon during the late 1960s. He liked to refer to himself as ""Mr. Mojo Risin"", an anagram of his name. Oliver Stone's film ""The Doors"" is mostly about Morrison ... his rise to stardom in the 1960s, his personality, and his mysterious death in 1971.",/review/rw2979160/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2014,burlesonjesse5,7," The Doors is a disturbing, overblown, trademark Oliver Stone film. But Val Kilmer is brilliant in it and that's reason to take in a viewing
","After winning two best director Oscars (Born on the Fourth of July, Platoon respectively) at the Academy Awards, Oliver Stone could pretty much do whatever he wanted. So given his affection for 60's nostalgia, he decided to helm this 1991 biopic on one of rock and roll's all time greatest bands (one of my favorite rock groups as well). The Doors is a prime example of what a filmmaker can do if the vision of what's on screen is entirely his (not necessarily what the remaining members of The Doors themselves had intended). With as much clout as any major voice in Hollywood, Stone made an exercise that veers almost completely away from the storytelling of the band, and instead concentrates on the madness and mystery of lead singer Jim Morrison. The result is a fiery yet saturated, powerful yet overwhelming, and sad yet involving portrait of a musical icon who passed over much too early. Now I gotta warn ya, this thing is over 2 hours long and is exhausting. It's also an ambitious mess (don't worry, this is a compliment) that's filled with every Stone nuance in the book (you almost have to wear dark sunglasses to tackle the look of it). But it's saddled with a brilliant performance by Val Kilmer as the lead. And he anchors this kaleidoscope of late 60's culture bent on entertaining you if you let it. So to make things clear, I am to this day, a huge fan of Oliver Stone's 90's endeavors. He has calmed down a bit as a director these days. And don't get me wrong, I still think he knows what he's doing behind the camera. But I kinda wish the maverick in him would come back (a la The Doors). There is just too much control with his technique in present day. I kinda hate it to be honest.",/review/rw2979160/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2008,b_buddy1,8," Val Kilmer's Magnum Opus
","The Doors is unapologetically a film about sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. For 140 minutes we follow Doors singer Jim Morrison from his days as an aspiring film student at UCLA to his death in Paris in 1970 at the age of 27. Writer-director Oliver Stone based the story of the film on some 150 transcripts detailing the life and character of Morrison. The result is far from flattering. The Doors paints a picture of a man enamored with death, his own inevitable demise more a relief than an agony.",/review/rw2979160/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2004,Ben_Cheshire,8," Absorbing movie - i didn't want it to end. (my only friend...)
","Utterly absorbing bio-pic of Jim Morrison. The name Val Kilmer is, or should be, synonymous with incredible acting that is not merely natural or convincing, but immensely fun and commanding. You may have noticed while watching his recent Wonderland - Val has the ability to make a picture. Here, he IS The Doors: The Movie. There, he WAS Wonderland. I am exaggerating, i suppose. For Oliver Stone has crafted a marvellous film which makes you feel like you've experienced what the sixties were like. Through using The Doors actual music (what was missing from the recent Sylvia, the art of the subject itself - her poetry) to help tell its story and colour its scenes, and filmic techniques to create the drug-induced world vision of Jim Morrison, Stone really takes you into the world of his movie, and the world of the sixties.",/review/rw2979160/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2016,SnoopyStyle,7," solid biopic
","It's 1965 L.A. Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer), UCLA film student, meets Pam Courson (Meg Ryan). He quits school and forms The Doors with Ray Manzarek (Kyle MacLachlan), John Densmore (Kevin Dillon), and Robby Krieger (Frank Whaley). They become one of the foremost counter culture rock banks of the era. The band drifts apart as Jim travels a different path with witchy journalist Patricia Kennealy (Kathleen Quinlan). In 1970, he faces charges for exposing himself during a Miami concert. He's living with Pam when he dies in Paris at age 27 in 1971.",/review/rw2979160/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 2000,famsmith,9," A refreshing cinematic breakthrough in an era in which cinema seems all but forgotten!
","This film is truly a gem.  The Doors is easily the best film of the rock n' roll genre and at least one of the most important films of its era. Though I am not an Oliver Stone fan I must give credit where it is due.  Stone really does a terrific job with this film, and shows what he is capable of when he actually knows about the subject he is attempting to comment on. A few of the scenes in the film are almost exact recreations of actual events. However, the magnificent thing about this film is that it manages to recreate a certain amount of reality while simultaneously realizing that for a film to possess its own vitality it must transcend the preexisting reality, move beyond the surface, beyond everything that is obvious, and express and explore something deeper.  Val Kilmer delivers a powerful performance in which he almost seems to be channeling the energy of Jim Morrison, and though I've seen many of Meg Ryan's films this is the only one I can recollect where she does such a good job that she makes you really forget about her and focus on the character.  The cinematography of the film by Robert Richardson (Platoon, Wall Street, Born on The Fourth of July, Natural Born Killers, Casino, Bringing out the Dead, and many more) is bold and unique making the film one of the most distinct visual films I've ever seen.  This film is truly one of a kind, and breaks through into new cinematic territory, giving priority to the visual aspects of the film in an era where there are so few films that even give much consideration to the single most important aspect of the motion picture.  The genius of this film is that it is visual-audio as opposed to audio-visual and is more concerned with expressing something than simply impressing the audience.  The Doors is a refreshing cinematic breakthrough in an era in which cinema seems all but forgotten.",/review/rw2979160/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2011,KnightsofNi11,9," A self-destructive masterpiece
","I never thought much of Val Kilmer, but after watching Oliver Stone's incredible biopic, The Doors, that perception has changed entirely. This is the ultimate story of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. Kilmer plays frontman of the famous 60's rock band The Doors, Jim Morrison. Morrison is a self absorbed, self destructive, self proclaimed poet whose experiences with drugs, sex, and music make him a fascinating mess of a man. Kilmer portrays him to perfection in one of the most immaculate and hypnotic biopics I've ever seen.",/review/rw2979160/?ref_=tt_urv

12 August 2005,lee_eisenberg,10," love this movie two times, and forever after that
","Probably no music biopic has ever done a greater job looking into its subject than ""The Doors"". Focusing mainly on Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer), we get to see his masterful ability to write songs, but also his demons and his descent into complete madness. Jim Morrison was a genius and a nut. The movie never makes the mistake of becoming a litany of songs: it looks at the historical context, with the Vietnam War and everything else that made up the '60s. Val Kilmer does an incredible job playing Jim Morrison, and Meg Ryan is equally good as his girlfriend Pamela. Believe you me, there will never be another Jim Morrison. When he died in 1971, that really was the end.",/review/rw2979160/?ref_=tt_urv

Hendrix, Joplin and Morrison were pretty much household names among music fans of the era, and their passing shocked and confused everyone.

27 November 1998,Peach-2,9," What a ride.
","Oliver Stone's film, The Doors, is a visual delight. Stone has taken the music of The Doors and made this film as a homage to one of the great rock performers. Val Kilmer's performance as Jim Morrison will not be forgotten. He captures the role in every frame of the movie. The whole cast is well thought out as a matter of fact and Stone uses them wisely. Olver Stone is one of our great film-makers and this film will be appreciated in years to come as a staple of the rock-n-roll movie.",/review/rw2979160/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2005,joediduca,9," Great visual film that concentrates on one aspect of a brilliant but troubled rock legend.
","Jim Morrison wrote many of the Doors songs and was a complete drunk by the time he died in 1971. This film depicts Morrison in a very one sided view. Yes he was an alcoholic with a disregard for authority, yes he was on self destruct mode and burnt out quickly reaffirming the James Dean ""Live fast Die young"" motif. But what is missing from Stone's depiction of him was his great intellect,his absurd humour and his natural talent as a composer and vocalist. However it is a wonderfully visual film that takes the viewers on a hallucinogenic ride through drug hazed Los Angeles in the late 60's. It was the first of many films that Stone created in the 90's using an almost dream like quality to evoke the feeling of the turbulent times.",/review/rw2979160/?ref_=tt_urv

","I KNOW I'm giving way too many stars for this, but I don't care; The Doors were one of my very first favourite groups. I fondly recall, when I was 11, and Elektra Records released 'The Doors' Greatest Hits', and the album-length version of 'Light My Fire' was played all the time on the radio, and I was mesmerized by the instrumental middle of the song, got the album from my parents for Christmas, and started a lifelong love affair with the band. Yes, Jim Morrison is highly overrated. Yes, the movie is an extremely self-indulgent mess and it can be quite incoherent and incohesive. But the Sixties, the L.A. rock scene back then, and especially Morrison's life, were just like that, so it is oh so fitting!",/review/rw2979160/?ref_=tt_urv
