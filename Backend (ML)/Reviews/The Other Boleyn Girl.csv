1 March 2008,lavatch,8," A Film Worth Seeing for the Issues of Gender
","The Other Boleyn Girl is a compelling film due to the exceptional performances and the splendid costumes. Additionally, there is simply a terrific story told about the relationship of Henry VIII and the two Boleyn sisters, Anne and Mary.",/review/rw1919068/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2008,dollparts1215,6," Eh... Nice costumes and sets
","If you want a good movie about Henry VIII and Anne Bolyen, rent Anne of the Thousand Days. That was a film that used history to tell a story about real people who had a love to change a nation. ",/review/rw1919068/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2008,divadrummer,7," Sometimes the Truth is Stranger Than Fiction
","A quick glimpse at the Tudor family line on Wikipedia will yield hundreds of years of made-for-movie material, but none quite as compelling as the story of Anne Boleyn. Pair a classic story with airy language, beautiful sets and costumes, and some A-list names and you have Oscar magic in the making. Right? Well, not always. We've seen it before and we're not necessarily impressed with royalty anymore. The Other Boleyn Girl offers new perspectives and dramatic angles on the saga of wives that is Henry VIII's legacy, but nearly drowns in melodrama.",/review/rw1919068/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2008,gazebo,7," Beautifully filmed historical film that is not historical at all!
","I went to watch this movie knowing that even though the historical figures are real, the story is basically fiction, only Philippa Gregory's version of the tragedy of Anne Boleyn. Watching this film with this attitude really helped me enjoy it rather than be upset that all the historic characters' personalities were so distorted that they were almost unrecognizable. I suggest anyone else going to see this movie adopt this attitude too.",/review/rw1919068/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2008,venessalewis,3," Outrageously Inaccurate
","The ""Other Boleyn Girl"" hit theaters today, and of course, I was in for the first showing. I've been anticipating this movie for over 2 years now, ever since I first heard it was in production. ",/review/rw1919068/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2010,sarastro7,1," A besotted travesty of history
","I am all for trying to do something different, trying to make some new and intriguing point about this or that... no, wait, I guess I'm not. At any rate, whatever they tried to do with this freakosaurus of a ""historical"" movie, they completely and unforgivably failed at. I know this bit of history well, and have seen most treatments of it in movies and TV shows; even the irreverent and sensationalist Tudors TV show is a masterstroke of brilliance compared to the pondscum that is The Other Boleyn Girl.",/review/rw1919068/?ref_=tt_urv

8 March 2008,blackburnj-1,7," Satisfying and entertaining, but it promised so much more
","The Tudors are very chic at the moment. If it isn't ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" (awful) or the television series, ""The Tudors"" (soft-pornographic trash), then it is ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", the latest film written by the Oscar nominated screenwriter, Peter Morgan. After his work on the Golden Globe winning TV film ""Longford"" and the Oscar winning (for its lead actors) ""The Queen"" and ""The Last King of Scotland"", his scripts must be in demand by actors across the globe. Little wonder then that this film attracts a stellar cast, including Eric Bana, Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman. So, why is it that this film, which is filled with great talent and potential, delivers only satisfaction? This was originally slated for release late last year, right in the middle of the awards season. Yet, for some reason, it was moved back. Why this was done is not widely known, but, as the IMDb had the film listed as completed last autumn, I should think that the decision was taken that this film would draw more attention outside of the congested awards season. Watching the film, you are aware of the ambition and lavish costumes that would draw the gaze of Oscar. But the film lacks punch, depth and the power to grip you the whole way through.",/review/rw1919068/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2011,Leofwine_draca,3," Pretty costumes - and that's it
","This is a terrible film, there's no two ways about it. The script is bad, the actors miscast, and it fails to give any real insight into the Tudor era. I can forgive historical inaccuracy in decent films, but this is far from a decent film.",/review/rw1919068/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2008,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," Not a history lesson, it's a movie, a good one at that
","When I first saw the trailer for The Other Boleyn Girl, I have to admit, it looked good, but like it wasn't accurate. I am a huge history buff, especially in the time of England's dark ages, I am fairly familiar with the Boleyn sisters and their affections for King Henry, Anne being the second wife to be executed for committing adultery and not birthing a son heir to the thrown, her life was absolutely horrific if you think about how hard it was to be a woman in this era. I was a little scared that they wouldn't portray her well in this film, but my mom and I saw The Other Boleyn Girl today and even though I'm not fully satisfied with the portrayal of Anne, the movie is still very good. The story has a Hollywood layer to give the story a little more ""oomph"" sort of speak, like most other pictures, but The Other Boleyn Girl is still a very decent movie.",/review/rw1919068/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2010,ianlouisiana,1," The adventures of Anne Boleyn's smarter sister.......
","Mary was of course Anne's older sister,not younger,and she and her siblings were pimped by their social climbing father the appalling Thomas Boleyn(even the name ""Boleyn"" was an affectation borrowed from the French Court,their real names was ""Bullen"").The overall feeling is that if Henry had a taste for bestiality Boleyn would have pimped one of his wolfhounds. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is trash,basically.Only Miss S.Johansson escapes unscathed as ""The King's Great Matter"" is presented as a bodice - ripper that almost plays like a badly - written satire about the Tudor Court. Eric Bana is lousy as Henry the Eighth,portraying England's last all - powerful king as a spoiled 14 year old.Here was a sophisticated,learned man seen as a bearded Zac Effron. There were no feminists in Tudor England,whatever thoughts Lady Boleyn,who had allegedly been Henry's mistress as a young woman, might have had about the King's conduct about her children she kept to herself in order to survive. Mary Boleyn bore the King's Bastard and kept her head when many about her were losing theirs - a not inconsiderable achievement. That may be a subject worthy of a movie,but one would hope that it might be rather better than this load of tosh.",/review/rw1919068/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2012,Vincentiu,," nothing convincing
","interesting cast. and nothing else. desire to present an old story in easy form. and the strange result. all is childish, nothing convincing, a nice game with facts, legends and parts of truth. and, after so many travels in Tudors world, this is only a joke. not very inspiring. it is not a bad movie but it is far to be more than mediocre. and nobody is guilty. just the ambition to make history with actors in incorrect roles. because Eric Bana is not Henry (not more than ambiguous sketch ) , Natalie Portman is in wrong position and Scarlett Johassen - shadow of good intentions. no nuances, no roots. only a dark story with ridiculous accents. good actors and nice costumes are not enough.not in this case.",/review/rw1919068/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2008,Lemos,3," Watch the TV series The Tudors instead
","Every time an historical event or adaptation is put on our screens we expect some degree of historical inaccuracy, dramatical freedoms, mostly perhaps to allow for a limited time a film can run. This historical adaptation is just plain poor and awful. In fact this film perfectly illustrates why Hollywood is in dire trouble if it continues to produce nosh like this. Over the past years, we are now offered TV shows with high production values, good actors, well scripted stories. This recent TV production has raised the bar and expectations of viewers. If Hollywood and cinema production still thinks it can continue to factory produce material such as this, I certainly fear for it's future. Take this film and compare it to the series recently shown on UK TV - The Tudors. There is nothing in the Tudors; costumes, acting, screenplay, editing, script, etc, etc., that is not better than this.",/review/rw1919068/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2009,ma-cortes,6," Historical drama set in Tudor time about ambition , love and power
","This costumer was correctly based on historical happenings . These are the following ones : Catherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent) married Arthur , Henry VIII's (Eric Bana) older brother . Arthur died six months later and Catherine then married Henry . Twenty-four years later , Henry secretly married Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman) , Henry had already had an affair with Anne Boleyn's sister (Scarlette Johansson) and the marriage did not last long . Henry annulled his marriage to Catherine on the basis that she had been previously married to his brother Arthur , and the marriage was therefore invalid . Pope Clement VII refuse sanction Henry's marriage to Anne and excommunicated the English king in 1534 , then Thomas Crammer (Wallis) sanctioned Henry's marriage . But his concern to produce a male heir brought out the worst in him and Anne was discarded . She was accused of adultery with her brother George (Jim Sturgess) and four commoners. Thomas Howard (David Morrissey) acquiesced at the execution of his niece , Anne Boleyn , but subsequently lost Henry's favour and was condemned to death . Anne was beheaded in May 1536 .Eleven days later, Henry married Jane Seymour (Galloway) , but even the birth of Edward was overshadowed by real tragedy . Jane Seymour died twelve days after giving birth to a son , later Edward VI.",/review/rw1919068/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2008,CihanVercan,5," Not a good historical film, but a considerable drama with indefensible historical laxity.
","Don't trust either good or bad critics upon ""The Other Boleyn Girl"". It's a serious thing to castigate such a bold work. First of all, this movie is a mediocre adaptation of a heart-breaking novel of late epochs of the English kingdom and the royal family. This work of art(both novel and the movie) has a courage to reveal the unknown reasons of English kingdom becoming less potent with the Renaissance revolution from Italy, and losing the support of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church, accordingly becoming adversaries with Italy.",/review/rw1919068/?ref_=tt_urv

","""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is one of those films that is so boring that you start picking out the logical errors with the plot.

19 November 2017,rmax304823,6," It's GOOD to be the king.
","An uninspired title for a lavish royal story of intrigue, ambition, lust, power, mishigas, and witchery, bitchery, block. There were two Bolyn girls, you see -- Scarlett Johanssen as shy Mary Bolyn, with her exquisitely misshapen features, and Natalie Portman as Anne, girlish and grasping. The Bolyns, like the royal family itself, is full of knaves. I mean, imagine a father pimping off his two daughters, even to a Eric Bana's king. ",/review/rw1919068/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2008,rebwt,6," Don't go expecting accuracy!
","Overall, the movie is entertaining. I thought the acting was good, particularly Scarlett Johansson's. The cinematography and editing leave much to be desired, and the entire movie seems rushed. If you have any knowledge of Tudor history,you will recognize the many inaccuracies, but those did not bother me as much as did the fact that important characters were omitted, undeveloped, or even seemingly forgotten (as in the case of Mary's husband, William Carey).",/review/rw1919068/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2016,filipemanuelneto,3," It would be a better movie if it were historically accurate.
","This film is based on the love affairs between the English King Henry VIII and his two courtesans, Mary and Anne Boleyn, the second of which would become queen, though for a short period. Directed by Justin Chadwick, was written by Peter Morgan and has the participation of Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson and Eric Bana.",/review/rw1919068/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2008,Robert_duder,9," Brilliantly performances in a riveting story whether fiction or otherwise
","It seems like as of late if you decide to make a historical film or period piece you better have time traveled back and triple checked your facts. It seems to me that so many reviewers and movie goers are forgetting the key element to the movies...to have fun...to be entertained. Sure some films can do other things for us but this is still the key to Hollywood. I know little to nothing about the true history of Anne Boleyn, although after seeing the film it did encourage me to read into it which makes the film worthwhile in the first place. The story that they create is captivating and truly riveting. I found myself just enthralled by the story and the characters. It's not fast moving or full of action and yet I just couldn't stop watching and I wanted to know where everything was going. Director Justin Chadwick seems to be relatively new to the big screen direction process and yet he knew exactly how to deliver the story and what was or was not important. Granted he had the incredible opportunity of 2 HUGE Hollywood starlets but even still he had a story to tell and get the most out of it and he succeeds in a big way. You aren't overwhelmed by the time of the film, completely drowned with beautiful flourishing dresses and castles a la Marie Antoinette (see my review but not the movie) but rather gives you a little of that and a lot of story and character.",/review/rw1919068/?ref_=tt_urv

",Never have I seen an actress take control of a movie as much as Portman did with Boleyn. She stepped into the role so perfectly and did it was so much confidence.

27 July 2008,robert-temple-1,4," Shameless exploitation film, inferior re-tread with bad direction
","The BBC made a TV series of this in 2003 and then decided to flog that horse again, so this was the result, an inferior feature film, very badly directed indeed by Justin Chadwick. The casting is terrible. The history is nonsense. (Anne Boleyn was the younger sister, not the older one as misrepresented in the novel, etc., etc.) Despite the terrible flaws in this misconceived monster of a project, some sterling performances do stand out. The most impressive is Ana Torent, the Spanish actress who has been a favourite of true cineastes since she played a 12-year-old in 'El Nido' (1980). She nearly steals the film, and if it were not for Scarlett Johansson being so good, she would have. Johansson has a natural dignity and an innate sensitivity to period (as she showed in 'Girl with a Pearl Earring'), so she and Ana Torent were perfectly capable of directing themselves and pulling off magnificent performances. Natalie Portman was a casting disaster. In the first part of the film, obviously wholly lacking in any meaningful direction, she tries to portray the flighty young Anne but does so as a 2008 girl, complete with the same knowing looks and arrogant insouciance you would expect to find in that wonderful satire 'Clueless' (1995), rather than in a period drama. In the latter part of the film, where at last she has a definable character and situation which she can at last figure out, she delivers some very powerful dramatic acting indeed, but always with too modern a touch. She was simply not made for the 16th century, sorry. Australian Eric Bana is totally and even more disastrously miscast as King Henry VIII. Since everyone knows that Henry was gingery in appearance and inclined to corpulence, why do we see this ludicrous version of him as a kind of brooding macho chap who has just stepped in from the set of 'Star Trek'? For more than half of the film, everybody addresses the king as 'Your Grace', whereas for the whole of English history, no such form of address was ever used for a king, but was only used for bishops, dukes, and duchesses. More than halfway through, unable to re-shoot their earlier scenes, they suddenly realize their mistake and start calling him 'Your Majesty', but it is too late. David Morissey is way, way over the top in his portrayal of the Duke of Norfolk. There was clearly no directorial control with this production at all. Was Chadwick sitting gagged and bound in a corner, one wonders? Even that old pro Kristin Scott-Thomas wobbles in her early scenes, unsure of what everybody is meant to be doing. Mark Rylance looks like he needs to run and do diarrhoea in every scene. Eddie Redmayne does very well, which I am glad to see, as he never went to drama school and defied parental advice to be a banker, so he pulled it off before his father's three years of support was up, well done Eddie. Juno Temple does as well as she could in an undefined part with no help. Why do they keep doing this to history? Why don't they just tell the TRUE stories and be accurate once in a while? Truth is more interesting than all this nonsensical, exploitative fantasy. The producers, director, script writer, head of the BBC, and the whole sorry lot responsible for this abomination should be taken out and shot. No, correction, - beheaded! Must get it right!",/review/rw1919068/?ref_=tt_urv
