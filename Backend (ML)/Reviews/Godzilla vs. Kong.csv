28 May 2021,deanbean317,5," I left the affair feeling sad.
","Matthew Perry was always my favorite Friend, perfectly matched to the character that he played. It was very obvious that, perhaps due to some sort of diminished capacity, he was being marginalized during the entire affair. He wasn't asked many questions and his speaking parts were kept to a minimum. Also, it was very telling that, when Matthew Leblanc was telling a story, the other cast members looked at him with engaged smiles on their faces. When Matthew spoke, they all looked at him with sorrowful looks of pity. If you think I imagined it, rewatch it for yourself. Also, HBO hasn't realized that the vast majority of people now couldn't care less about the opinion of any celebrity. The time spent including their vacuous ramblings would have been better used showing screen tests or many other prominent historical clips. And finally...that James Corden thing.",/review/rw6973415/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2021,rajashakaziz,5," James Cordon spoiled it.
","Was great seeing the whole game for together again, but why in the hell was James Corden the host. Also not much of that was in the interviews on the storylines would of liked to see a bit more.",/review/rw6973415/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2021,famousjax,6," Great to see them!! Disappointed With random people
","Loved seeing the group together!!! But could have done without all the strangers and celebs talking about how they felt about friends and the lady Gaga part? I fast forward the parts with the random peeps and celebs, as nobody cares about random people or any celebs besides the Friends cast and who worked on friends as The magic of the show is the friends!!! Keep it with that as that is what people want to see!",/review/rw6973415/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2021,MovieWarfare,6," The James Corden segment sucks
","I love Friends when I was younger and was rooting for a reunion episode. Well, they finally did it but instead of a time skip episode, we instead got a reunion of the actors reminiscing about their time on Friends. I was very disappointed by that as I really wanted to see where the characters I loved were up to. Nonetheless, I was still interested to watch it just because we haven't seen the actors together in a long time as well. So was it a happy reunion or unneeded?",/review/rw6973415/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2021,drewnes,6," Matthew Perry: I don't hear from anyone.
","As a fan of the show, I wanted to love this so much, but I couldn't help but get sad. Why was this the first time they have set foot in the same room after all this time? I think Matthew Perry has gone through some hard times because he did not seem to be enjoying himself. The Fresh Prince of Bel Air Reunion had me feeling nostalgic and happy, where as this one had me feeling nostalgic and sad. Also where is Paul Rudd??",/review/rw6973415/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2021,eunbi0530,7," Alright, but I just can't stand Corden
","It is a reunion special where the main cast reminisce about the past, we are shown some fans pov and how the show influenced their lives, some behind the scenes that maybe most people didn't know, it is a nice treat for a reunion, but I also understand those disappointed that were expecting for a follow-up episode after all these years.",/review/rw6973415/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2021,marine_delacruise,4," Terrible Host
","And no Paul Rudd. Also, Chandler did have a job title you can check it on the Graham Norton Show. The OG cast is great , wish they didn't have irrelevant people like Mindy Kaling and Lady Gaga.",/review/rw6973415/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2021,thomasbgleeson,7," Ruined by James Corden
",A behind the scenes look at the 6 meeting up and reminiscing was enough and also the best part of the reunion. The obvious questions and terrible catwalk really made this a bit trashy. Why are people still hiring James Corden? Unfunny and unable to allow anyone else to talk. Was good but could have been much better.,/review/rw6973415/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2021,knightmohsen,10," Where is emma??
",Awesome seeing them together again and relive those moments but it missed a huge part. Where is emma?? They taped her first birthday to watch it back after 18 years which was 2020. It would have been really fun to see her after 18 years.,/review/rw6973415/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2021,tamarapopovicbg,4," Boring
","It's obvious that some of them were there only for the money. Matthew Perry just sat there quietly, it was kinda sad to watch. And when he said that none of the ""Friends"" contact him - I believed him.",/review/rw6973415/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2021,brtree,3," Cringie and Sad
","My wife and I are both huge Friends fans and have been looking forward to this reunion show for months. I could hardly have been more disappointed. Oh sure it was nice seeing them all again, but sad to see what the ravages of time has done. You kind of watch those old Friends episodes and get wrapped up in the youthful enthusiasm of all the characters... I didn't really enjoy having that snapshot in time shattered. Poor poor poor Matthew Perry! If he were curled up on a park bench with garbage swirling around him, he would look right at home. Perry was an empty shell of his former self and largely ignored throughout this whole program.",/review/rw6973415/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2021,a-albalushi,7," James Cordon was bad choice
",It takes you back and dig out those old laughs but the editing was big mess and all over the place,/review/rw6973415/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2021,IndecentLouie,3," What a shame
","A terrible host (From the UK I am so sorry to the US for giving you James Corden, we didn't want him and now you have to suffer.) and absolute pointless guest stars has made what could have been an amazing reunion and very sub par one.",/review/rw6973415/?ref_=tt_urv

30 May 2021,t-ktinney,5," Could this BE any worse?
","For one thing, we didn't learn much we didn't already know: Courtney Cox was originally supposed to be Rachel...The role of Rachel was hard to cast....yeah yeah yeah. But where were the characters that were significant in the series? Where was Emily? Phoebe's husband, Mike? Chandler's ""mother?"" Rachel's boyfriends? There were so many supporting actors left out. Hearing the supporting actors discuss their input would've been interesting. It felt like they were trying really hard to fill almost 2 hours and it got silly like the ridiculous ""fashion show?"" Could that BE any dumber?",/review/rw6973415/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2021,Njinked,3," No big deal
","Really no big deal here. Just the cast talking about their favorite memories/episodes/scenes...

29 May 2021,annamargret56-927-259215,1," Glorified talk show
","Just why. I was so disappointed not to see them act a final episode, but instead having talk show. I'm sorry, I love friends but talk shows are just not my thing :/",/review/rw6973415/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2021,deepfrieddodo,6," So Much Filler
","Brilliant for anyone who was particularly obsessed with the show, but really Friends: The Reunion is nothing special, and probably a bit of a disappointment to others. It's great to look back, skim the surface of what was going on behind the scenes, and hear from some key people, but there is just so much filler.",/review/rw6973415/?ref_=tt_urv

30 May 2021,acidburns-29835,1," Awkward
","It felt like this college reunion where you come for the free food and drinks (here replace by $$$) and you bump into people you clearly didn't want to see. It felt embarrassing for everyone, starting with the crew. The ""hey let's not wait years before having dinner together"" was the last drop. Useless.",/review/rw6973415/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2021,radufl,6," Mixed feelings
","'Friends' was pretty good, and I always watch the reruns. Two decades later, we're all a bit older and less fun, however Jennifer Aniston and Courtney Cox look really weird - I have no idea why some good-looking celebrities mess up their faces when getting old. Matthew Perry was also looking tired and older than you would expect. On the other hand, Lisa Kudrow and Matt LeBlanc were really funny and seem happy with their looks.",/review/rw6973415/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2021,griffith-janna,5," Sad
","I am an avid FRIENDS loyalist. I've won trivia night on the trivia. It stays in all day every day while I work from home. It brings me comfort. With all of that being said, this was what I expected, but worse. I didn't think it would live up to what I wanted. It didn't. It is about 30 minutes of actual friends content related. The rest is just fluff of ""celebrities"". Some of them I hadn't even heard before seeing this reunion. I don't care of their opinion of friends. You don't have to show me how friends has helped other people. There was nothing new that wasn't already known. Matt LeBlanc and Lisa Kudrow went right back to Joey and Phoebe. That was nice to see. Poor Matthew Perry. Waste of time.",/review/rw6973415/?ref_=tt_urv
