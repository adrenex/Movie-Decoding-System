","I'm already giggling picturing the cries of protest that will rise up when I post this review, but the hell with it, I really like Zach Snyder's Sucker Punch. I never deliberately play the contrarian, I just seem to often gravitate towards films that have been maligned by the masses, and I can't really help it. Now, in this film's case, a few of the many and varied negative criticisms are somewhat warranted, yet blown out of proportion when you really take a good look at the story. The film is pure style, and although Zachary might have let his imagination run a little wild and clutter the whole affair with fanboy fantasies and video game visuals, there is a clear and discernible story beneath if one cares to look. Now, the only way that story is entirely comprehended is by watching the extended director's cut, which includes an absolutely crucial, pivotal scene that's should have never, ever ended up on the editing room floor for the theatrical version. Seriously, they we're straight up asking for hostility and confusion by not keeping it in every cut of the film, it's just common sense. Speaking of story, here we go: the film opens in breathless style and classic patented Snyder slo mo, with young Baby Doll (Emily Browning) trying to save her little sister from their tyrannically abusive stepfather. Outsmarted and shipped off to an austere mental institution, her journey is a sad, surreal and somewhat befuddling one, but there's a method to the madness that might not be clear with only one viewing of the film. The asylum she is sent to is plagued by a sinister orderly (Oscar Isaac) who is abusing the girls in his care, and as a result, Baby Doll channels such horrors into a grandiose set of fantasy worlds, the base of which rests on a burlesque style brothel where she and others work for volatile pimp Blue (also Isaac). Joined by Amber (Jamie Chung), Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), she blocks out the reality of what is happening and replaces the details of an elaborate, systematic escape attempt with impossibly epic, highly stylized adventures, each of a different theme or set in a vaguely familiar period of history. Battling medieval dragons, giant samurai golems with mini-guns, WWI zombie hordes in a gaunt, bombed out European landscape, it's all a detailed rush of sound and fury that hits you like a ton of bricks, and although is far too much for the film to handle and still get its point across, it's completely dazzling stuff, especially on Blu ray. Guided by a mysterious Wise Man (a kickass, rootin tootin Scott Glenn) who shows up in a different get up each time and mentored by brothel Madam of sorts Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), each setting holds the key to move along a certain cog in their plan, correlating back down the line of delusions straight to the asylum, if a little tenuously. Now it all hinges on the arrival of the High Roller (Jon Hamm), a rich playboy who has come to the brothel to see Baby Doll dance, and probably more. Here's where they messed up royally: The scene I mentioned earlier is a monologue from him that is pretty much one of the most important parts of the film, capping off both realities beautifully, and without it, not only is Hamm relegated to basically a walk on extra, the entire final punch of the climax is rendered lost and neutered, not too mention quite uncomfortable in a sense. Whoever was in charge of that particular piece of the editing should be tarred, feathered and run off the studio lot by teamsters. With the scene left in on the extended version, however, the story is given both point and purpose, feeling like a complete vision with a little weight to go along with it's Hindenburg sized bag of visual tricks. Not Snyder's best for sure, but it's in no way close to the turkey some people will have you believe it is. Whiners. Style over substance? Yes, I'll definitely concede there's an imbalance, but don't try and tell me the whole thing is bereft of substance at all, because that is a lazily researched argument. The soundtrack is a treasure chest, I might add, with beautiful covers of Sweet Dreams and Sing Me To Sleep sung by Browning herself.",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2017,hitchcockthelegend,7," Snyder pushing buttons for polarising results.
","Off the bat I have to say I'm over thirty years older than what some pro critics have claimed is the demographic for this one. Sucker Punch, as reviews etc attest, is not for everyone, it has been called any number of things in derogative fashion, which since I enjoyed the film a lot means I'm a misogynist fetishist gamer, which to the best of my knowledge is not true. Lest I'm in the closet and now in middle age about to unleash traits and feelings previously untapped. Which if the latter is true you would have to say well done Zack Snyder, for that's serious film making...",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2014,Tweekums,7," Welcome to the asylum
","In the opening sequence we see a girl attempting to save her little sister from her abusive stepfather; unfortunately she is too late and he has already killed her; he then has her committed to a sinister asylum. The director, Blue, tells her she must be ready to please High Roller in a few days the asylum appears to double as a brothel with the female inmates expected to satisfy rich 'visitors'. As part of their therapy the girls must dance; when our protagonist, who has been dubbed Babydoll, starts to perform she finds herself transported to a fantasy world where she meets a man who tells her she will need five things to gain her freedom; a map, fire, a knife, a key and another item only she will know he also gives her a variety of weapons that she will need to defeat three twelve foot demonic samurai! Once they are dispatched she finds herself back in the asylum; apparently her dance was amazing. She then tells the girls of her plans to escape and together they work to get the items; each time the try to get one Babydoll distracts people with her dance; during which times she is transported to a different fantasy world where she and the other girls battle a variety of dangers and any failures have consequences in the real world assuming anything we see after her arrival at the asylum is real.",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2011,bob the moo,," Not as awful as you have heard but just empty, noisy, pointless, heartless and cynically commercial
","Of course I had heard all the negative reviews when I sat to watch this. Of course I had seen the MTV-friendly action trailer. But critics can be biased and marketing can be misleading, so I decided to give this a go. On the face of it this film could have been similar to Pan's Labyrinth in regards the idea of a young girl/woman living through hardship and extending that hardship into a fantasy world of demons and otherworldly creatures. Certainly after watching the first very stylish fifteen minutes this felt like a film that would take this foundation of abuse and deep physiological injury and do something exciting, interesting and clever with it – at least, that's how it felt it could have been.",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2011,TheLittleSongbird,6," Some good, some bad...
","I do agree Sucker Punch is a love it, hate it type of film. Some people loved it, some despised me. As for me, I neither loved it or hated it. I have mixed feelings on Sucker Punch. I noticed some good things, but some areas of improvement too. It is not among my favourites of the year, but I think there are much worse movies released this year.",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2011,johnnymacbest,4," A fistful of mediocrity.
","With 300, Zack Snyder has made it abundantly clear that his movies dazzle they eyes, indeed they do, but his characters never engage the audience in a personal and emotional level. And Sucker Punch is just that. A visually dazzling collage of mental insanity taken to the extreme with a fairly interesting premise that looks promising on the surface, but never truly lets you sink your teeth into the inner workings of the main character.",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2020,Calicodreamin,7," Unique
","An interesting way to tell a story, that's for sure. I wasn't always sure what was going on... but it works itself out in the end. Not very much dialogue, but it's not really needed. The cinematography is what steals the show, a visually stunning movie. Lovely dark vibes and kickass ladies.",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2011,zetes,2," A disaster
","A crime against the cinema. It's too bad. I honestly have enjoyed Zack Snyder's films in the past, besides that crappy owl movie he made last year. I'd classify them more as guilty pleasures than actual good movies, but I found them entertaining and neat to look at. Sucker Punch, though, combines all his worst traits and adds a script that he himself wrote (along with co-writer Steve Shibuya). His previous films were all adaptations, three of picture books and one a remake of a George A. Romero classic. He didn't have to think much himself to make those neat images. Sucker Punch demonstrates that he just doesn't have the ability to think of things himself. It's a movie that combines mental hospitals, burlesque shows, giant samurai warriors, half-mechanical zombie-Nazis, mech suits, orcs, dragons, killer robots, and atomic bombs, pretty much every cool thing one can think of.",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2021,dilloncamp,8," Watch it twice for the heartbreak.
","Really underrated movie. It's not just your typical stylized action flick, it's quite a heartbreaking story in its core.",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2018,Foutainoflife,7," Unique Film You Must Have A Taste For
","So, I'm not the biggest fan of this movie because of the, for the lack of a better term, steam punkish feel and the Bjork music. However, the story is pretty interesting, the acting was decent and the sets had a dark, almost gothic feel. It is a different movie, for sure. You will more than likely love it or flat out hate it. If you're searching for something different check it out. You won't be disappointed.",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2011,gregeichelberger,1," Suckerpunched into seeing this travesty
","This film could not be more appropriately titled. I was a ""sucker"" to pay good money to see this slop, and I felt like ""punching"" writer/producer/director Zach Snyder for putting me (and many others) through it.",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2018,nothimme,9," Just like Stanley Kubrick's ''Eyes Wide Shut''
","Don't look at the movie the way it is. You can hate it for whatever reasons you like but this movie isn't just stupid, soulless and pointless sexual fantasy. There is more thought put into it than you could ever imagine. Too bad critics panned the movie for the things that couldn't comprehend and the audience went with it.",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2011,bkoganbing,6," Another Trip To Willoughby
","Watching Sucker Punch put me in mind of a great old Twilight Zone episode A Stop At Willoughby. Young Emily Browning has been committed to an asylum where apparently all the patients are young and nubile women who are played by Vanessa Hudgens, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, and Jane Chang. There seems to be a good reason for that as these women have to dance alluring dances and perform other services for high rolling customers. A way for the asylum to make some money.",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2011,Quicksand,3," What If You Spent $50 Million on a CGI Man Taking a Dump?
","It's kind of difficult to comment on the movie, without just writing, ""Terrible,"" and clicking the submit button. To write a good comment, one must write WHY it is terrible... but where to begin? If someone came into your home, and defecated in the middle of your living room, would you need to explain in a calm manner, three reasons why the person was wrong for doing such a deed? No. You'd toss them by their ear out onto the street, left with the unenviable task of having to clean up. Perhaps you'd even call the police.",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2021,Miroslav-27,7," Worth Revisiting!
","I just rewatched this movie and wow am I glad I did! Talk about underrated! Sure, the entire movie is a bit over the top, but Zack Snyder deserves more credit than he was given when this movie originally came out 10 years ago.",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2011,neil-476,5," Adolescent stinker
","I enjoyed 300: I loved the look of it. I enjoyed Watchmen: I loved the look of it. I loved the look of The Owls of Ga'Hoole. So, on the basis of my enjoyment of Zack Snyder's back catalogue, I have been looking forward to Sucker Punch for months, although I have been getting a little worried at some of the negative comment I have been hearing. In fact, given that the only solidly positive comment I have encountered comes from someone who strikes me as having some fairly serious mental health issues, I might have been seriously concerned had I not been firmly of the opinion that I should always form my own opinions, uninfluenced by others.",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2011,Enchorde,7," Very unconventional, but entertaining and beautiful
","First of all, Sucker Punch is a really controversial, odd movie, certainly not for everyone. It's an uncommon mix of spectacular high octane action and a dark grey psychological drama about a girl wrongfully imprisoned and abused at a mental institution. These sometimes sharp shifts between genres, and contrasts in storytelling, might not be to everyone's liking. If you expect a simple and purely entertaining action movie, you'll probably feel cheated and disappointed, because Sucker Punch certainly isn't that. Sucker Punch works on more levels than that.",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2011,Meven_Stoffat,2," The critics were wrong... yet again
","I'm starting to wonder if we're seeing the same movies as the critics nowadays. Or at least, if we're getting different cuts of movies. Because I've often found myself walking out going ""Did I see a different movie than the critics?"" ",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2021,the_real_smile,8," first hated it, then loved it
","To my opinion the balance between action and other scenes os way of, the action scenes are of the best you will ever see, the other scenes are terribly boring. When I fast forwarded to the action scenes I became to love this movie. My advise, watch it for the fantastic amazing action scenes.",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2011,tedg,," Intersection as the Razor to the Eye

27 March 2011,scotthad,1," Do NOT watch this movie, unless you like getting sucker punched.

17 March 2011,Loving_Silence,8," A love it or hate it type of film.
","I personally enjoyed the film and I am a fan of Zack Snyder's previous films (Watchmen,300,and Dawn of the Dead). The visuals were pretty much stunning with very few exceptions, but they are easily forgiven and not distracting at all. The acting wasn't anything ""Oscar"" worthy, but then again it shouldn't be. The performances were very good for an action film and I like it that way. This films definitely attracts the teenage male demographics, who like action packed films filled with hot women. This film, however is not for everyone. Some people might not like CGI, some women might be offended that this film is very shallow, violent, and very degrading towards women.This is definitely the type of movie you'll either love or hate.",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2011,thebackofmyhouse,6," Snyder let loose is not a good Snyder
","I loved all of Zack Snyder's films up until this one. This is his first original film, not one based on an existing properties. It seems he has these great action set pieces thought out in his mind but no movie to put it in. So he has written his own movie where all these action set pieces can be realized. This is what the movie feels like. An excuse for a few actions scenes. I have to admit, Snyder knows how to direct action, but for some reason, when it comes to this movie, he seems to loose his touch. Even though there are no shaky camera, there's another thing that dampens the action scenes, it the fast-panning. For this movie he wants the audience to get close to the action, so there's a lot of close ups, but there's a lot of panning too to show what's gong on. There isn't enough wide shots. It's the wide shots which are the highlights of the action scenes. And another downer is that the story in itself contributes to the weightlessness of the action. It is supposed to take place inside an imagination so the viewer never really feels as if the girls are in real danger. It is very easy for the girls to defeat those monster/robot bad guys. The only time when there was really any sense of danger was the fight scene in the trenches. The other scenes, the bad guys are just walk-overs. The acting wasn't that good either. So, as a fan of Zack Snyder, I'm disappointed. I hope his Superman is better.",/review/rw2403705/?ref_=tt_urv
