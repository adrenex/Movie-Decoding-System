24 July 2005,ScottDMenzel,9," A disturbing, raw film with a powerhouse story and great acting
","""Mysterious Skin"" is a movie that I heard very little about. Never saw the trailer, never saw a poster nothing. Until one day I was just looking up movies online and I came across this film. I looked up the website, watched the trailer, and said I want to see this. So I didn't get around to it when I lived in California since it came and went very quickly however the film did show up in a little theater about 5 miles from my house so I figured I have to check this film out and so I did.",/review/rw1144896/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2005,PaulLondon,10," A Masterpiece
","Araki has abandoned the nihilistic day-glo world of L.A teens to create his first truly great film. Indeed, by any standards, this film is magnificent. It follows two boys; one of whom was abused as a child and the other who believes that he was abducted by aliens' from childhood to their troubled later lives. The film has a visual beauty that pulls the viewer in even though the subject matter is both difficult and painful. The director pulls no punches in confronting the viewer with the horror of the situation but neither does he exploit it for tabloid style sensationalism. From the superb performances, the excellent and intelligent script, through to the inspired direction and stunning 'shoegazer' soundtrack this is a splendid film. I left the cinema deeply moved by what I had seen and can now only hope that Araki continues to work at this level of quality. Something quite special and a work of art",/review/rw1144896/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2006,Galina_movie_fan,8," Neil: ""I wished with all my heart we could just leave this world behind. Rise like two angels in the night and magically disappear. ""
","Mysterious Skin (2004) directed by Gregg Araki is powerful, shocking and absolutely convincing in every detail movie about two teenagers that were deeply affected by the events of one long hot summer of their childhood; events that one of them could not forget and the other desperately tried to remember. Ten years later, their lives could not be more different - Neil (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has became a gay hustler, cynical, manipulative but charismatic, while Brian (Brady Corbet), nervous and shy believes that he was abducted by the aliens for some strange experiments.",/review/rw1144896/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2005,CharteredStreets,9," Sounds like a heavy drama, but has a strange lightness; refreshing and intelligent
","""Mysterious Skin"" is a mysterious movie. Not mysterious in a boring, unoriginal way, where the screenwriter screws you around with information; mysterious in the way that the characters are opening up in front of you, and yet they're still enigmas; their depths hidden in plain view. It is the story of two teenage boys who were both sexually abused by the same man when they were younger. You already probably think the movie is dark and heavy, but it's not; it imposes no message on the viewer, and does not come to any easy conclusions. It has a strange tone throughout  a little like remembering something terrible and being unable to deal with it properly. ",/review/rw1144896/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2005,jvframe,10," equal amounts compelling, moving, beautiful and shocking
","""Mysterious Skin"" is right on the mark. Araki explores ten years in the lives of two youths who were abused as children. Araki shows how each youth struggles to get a grip on some sort of normality in life. Importantly he also shows the abuser's self-justification process.",/review/rw1144896/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2013,ironhorse_iv,7," A Powerful Mysterious Movie.
","This movie is mysterious to most people as it might go under the radar as it's deals with personal social issues in society such as homosexuality, child on child abuse, and prostitutes. It's hard to find anyways due to the subject matter and it being rated NC-17 in some areas and R in others. Surprising it was banned in Australia for a while. If you are homophobic, you might not like this movie. Honestly, you don't see much nudity, but a few ass shots, cruel language, and sex sounds. Some of the sex acts are bit hilarious to me, like the big guy asking a skinny guy to rammed him in the butt, or the whole talk about fisting. It's outrageous to me since I rarely know people that like that sex acts, but there is people out there that like to do those kinky stuff. Most audiences members will probably not watch a movie like this for entertainment reasons because of such taboos subjects. I would agree that this movie is not for the normal movie watcher, but for mature audiences looking for a movie to look deeper into these social issues and explain more and more why these subjects are deemed improper to talk about. First off, like the book by Scott Heim, the movie is disturbing. Not because of the homosexual acts so much, but because of the pedophile scenes and the whole male rape scene. I'd be grossed out the same amount even if it happen to a girl. I just don't like seeing rape, and child molested. It didn't help that the actor playing the Coach (Bill Sage) look like a young Robert Redford and the young man who grew up to be a male prostitute Neil McCormick is played by Joseph Gordon Levitt. I can't help thinking of this movie being Angels in the Outfield (1994) and the Natural (1980) mixed in a blender with My Own Private Idaho (1991). I do find the beginning parts very hard to watch though. While this is happening, a smart withdrawn young man Brian Lackey (Brady Corbet) is looking for the truth about his past. Brian Lackey is determined to discover what happened during an amnesia blackout when he was eight years old. He believes he was abducted by aliens, and believes that Neil McCormick may be the key as to exactly what happened that night. Without spoiling it, the movie is pretty predictable. You pretty much know what happen to Brian. The UFO and Aliens storyline was weird in the beginning but it all made sense in the end. The acting is pretty good. Both Joseph Gordon Levitt and Brady Corbet were good at their roles. About, Brady Corbet's role, I have to say, he was great. Too bad, it didn't state out. I was kinda confused, because his look and character was way too similar to Lucas's (1986), Lucas Bly character played by Corey Haims. I have to say, I love the women leads, such as Wendy (Michelle Trachtenberg) who plays Neil's friend trying to save him from his dangerous life as a hustler. The other one is Avalyn (Mary Lynn Rajskub) who befriends Brian due to their share interest of aliens. I felt sorry for her character, and wonder why she believes she was abducted by aliens. Seeing her use of the cane, can only help explain a bit of that. I would had love a follow up of that character in the end, in my opinion. Gregg Araki did a fantastic making this film. Still there were some things that I would have like to be worked better on. The beginning felt more like a novel than a movie. It's starts with Neil narrating, and follow up with Brians. Then it's stops, and picks up again in the end, with Neil narrating yet again without Brian's closure narrating. If you going to make a movie, show, don't tell. If you going to have narrating, have one narrator, not two. Also, continue the narrating throughout the film. It felt sloppy and cut to pieces. Also the scenes were too short. It felt like every scene end with fade out. It would have been better to combined scenes together to make them longer. The movie drags way too long. I also didn't like the molested scenes with the child actors. I know those scenes were selectively edited. The children didn't know the context of their parts when they were filmed, but it's felt too real for me. While, I'm not gay, I don't believe being molested, makes you gay. If that were true, counting all the gay people in the world, we have a gross abundance of pedophiles and neglectful parents in our society. Child molesters, whether they molest the opposite sex or the same sex, find the most vulnerable children, lure them in, and use that trust to abuse them. Being molested doesn't change a person's sexual orientation, but it does damage them psychologically as you can see in the movie with Brian and Neil. One may act out in a self-destructive way, while the other would be more closed up. I don't think Brian was even gay. I'm not 100% sure. I didn't read the novel. It's interesting, where they went with character development, while not grand on a certain scale it was still.really powerful. The end, kind of left me feeling.a little hollow. Poor Brian, and poor Neil. I kept thinking 'I want there to be emotional closure for them'. I guess it's more realistic this way. Overall: not for everybody, but a phenomenal raw movie.",/review/rw1144896/?ref_=tt_urv

Meanwhile, the also eight years Brian Lackey awakes from a brief amnesia of four hours with a bleeding nose, but his negligent father does not pay attention to the event.

26 April 2005,RackOutOfFocus,10," Very strong movie with difficult content
","I had high hopes for this film, since I have been a big fan of the novel on which it is based. The film exceeded my expectations in every way. Although quite faithful to the book (with many lines of dialogue and narration moving straight from Scott Heim's poetic prose), the movie has more drive and focus and pulls you so far into the troubled characters. Credit for the movie's strength goes all around -- director Araki put his mark on the story without taking it over. He got uniformily good performances (and somehow managed to direct scenes that any reader of the book would have thought completely unfilmable). Kansas has never looked better, or more sinister. The music is used well throughout.",/review/rw1144896/?ref_=tt_urv

","Just got back from the Sundance Film Festival. I am still processing this powerful movie and the stunning reminder of the cost some of life's choices bring to our lives. I was amazed at the brutal honesty of this story. While I cannot say enough about the acting, Brady Corbet's subtle portrayal of Brian should be honored and remembered for a very long time.

","Gregg Araki's ""Mysterious Skin"" is a film that dares to point out the lasting effects of what a pedophile will inflict on a young person that will last a whole lifetime. Mr. Araki has adapted Scott Heim's novel with great style.

15 April 2013,museumofdave,7," Admirable Foray Into Difficult Subject Matter With Dedicated Performances
","A strong, admirable, sometimes difficult to watch foray into the indelible mark made by a child molester; whether he picks on boys or girls is not the point--when children are misused for adult gratification, the results are lasting, forever marking a person's ability to relate positively to another. Lest this sound clinical, the film is not--it is often complex, never less than sincere, my only complaint being that perhaps too much emphasis is put on sexual escapades tilting the film towards sensational instead of revealing. The performances by the young actors are unusually stark, moving, and sincere: no cheap pet tricks here.",/review/rw1144896/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2005,russell-sherman,10," great film
","As a movie lover and social worker, I was really moved throughout this film - for most of this film - by the subject matter and by the powerful portrayal and production of these characters. Overall, this is a highly rated movie and one can only wonder at the mentality of persons in Australia who pushed for the banning of this film. This is a realistic account of the affects on the victims of child abuse and tells a compelling story of their plight. But don't expect a happy ending; there is some resolution but you know the battle continues and their struggle to overcome will go on. (I'm getting emotional again just thinking about the last scene.) I work with young people (15-25) who have been abused, often by their own parents, and placed into the care system. However, I have had clients who have then been abused in care as well. It is hard to reconcile such young people but gaining justice is quite central, as is a belief they are accepted and worthwhile human beings. Because they may have been sexually aroused during the abuse they can often feel guilty and to blame. They often internalise these feelings and depending on their personalities they will implode against themselves (drugs etc) and/or become de-sensitised to certain feelings and take risks. The boys in this film portray these two dichotomies and they do it very well. 10 stars.",/review/rw1144896/?ref_=tt_urv

5 June 2006,The_Void,7," Uncomfortable, but worth seeing
","Based on the novel by Scott Heim, Indie flick Mysterious Skin really goes to show how times have changed. Back in the eighties, a film called 'The Witch Who Came From the Sea' was banned for rather tame scenes involving a minor being sexually abused by an older man; yet this film tackles themes of paedophilia, homosexuality and the corruption of youth head on with no problems at all. It's lucky that Gregg Araki's film works from a strong script and benefits from good production values - otherwise a story like this could have easily been passed off as trash. The film follows the idea of sexual abuse against children and it's implications in their later life. Mysterious Skin focuses on two boys; Neil and Brian, who were both abused as a child. Each one has taken it rather differently; Neil has become a male prostitute, while Brian is constantly haunted by the idea that he was abducted by aliens as a child. We follow the pair to breaking point and the film climaxes with their meeting and a horrible revelation...",/review/rw1144896/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2007,hapiores,9," On a Journey Under the Skin
","Certain topics  in this case pedophilia  are very tricky when it comes to an adaptation on screen: it's very easy to go over the top and make something purely shocking; that's probably the biggest challenge, simply trying to portray the story without annihilating the audience. There are a few good examples of this, perhaps the ""safe"" ones: Brockeback Mountain, Philadelphia or Crash, seem to have found a balance between the delicacy of the topics and the need to take it to the audience in an effective, powerful, way.",/review/rw1144896/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2004,cldavison,10," Gave me goosebumps
","Amazing. I was expecting another sexually charged adrenaline infused dark comedy a la Doom Generation or an ironic look at relationships in the post-modern world like Splendor. Instead I found a more mature, calmer tale. Still funny, but muted, dark but based on the darker parts of human nature in reality... The performances were unbelievable. Joseph Gordon-Levitt came across with a combination of grit and beauty, anger and happiness that reminded me of Colin Farrell. The cockiness of youth, the sadness of child abuse, and a realistic recognition of prepubescent sexuality. The opening sequence reminded me of something in my youth - nothing specific it just left me with this certain feeling. I hope this is a sign of things to come....",/review/rw1144896/?ref_=tt_urv
