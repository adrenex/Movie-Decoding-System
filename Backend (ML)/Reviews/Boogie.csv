","I've found it fascinating over the past 20 years that with the advances made in special effects techniques, comic book heroes have had an explosion in popularity on the screen. The films, good, bad or indifferent seem to make money with a built in market. We seem to get a few of them every year with accompanying merchandise.",/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2004,clydestuff,8," A film that deserved a better fate
","Many times film have such bad vibes during production that they are rumored to be a terrible mess before they have a chance to premiere.  Some films that suffered this fate during filming were The Godfather and Titanic.  Both turned out to be box office bonanzas and the trouble they had making it to the big screen was quickly forgotten. Then there are films like Valley of the Dolls and Myra Breckinridge which were legendary for their on the set squabbles and dissension among cast members.  The end product of both of those productions were films that should have won awards for being the ultimate in cinema stinkers.  In 2003, we are given The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which had already become legendary for it's problems between director Stephen Norrington and lead actor Sean Connery. Add to that such disasters as a flood wiping out production in Prague and you have a nation full of critics ready to pounce.  And film critics being what they are in not wanting to waste an opportunity, pounce they did making it one of the worst reviewed films in the past year.  Add to that the fact that Fox made the mistake of pitting it against Pirates of the Caribbean in it's opening weekend and it you have the makings of a box office disaster. Did League deserve it?  No, it's a film that in my opinion is fun, highly watchable, and deserved none of the over the top blasting it took from some critics.  Maybe if it had come out after Gigli many would have looked more kindly on it.",/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2004,keenan-1,7," Heavens, it wasn't THAT bad!
","I've been reading the comments page in a somewhat bemused fashion.  It seems to be divided between people who don't like the movie because it's not enough like the original graphic novel and people who don't like it because they've never heard of half of the characters that are members of the League.  The latter seems to me to be an unutterably silly reason for disliking a film.  Does nobody read the classics anymore?  Nobody reads Oscar Wilde, Bram Stoker, Robert Louis Stevenson, Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?  I find that difficult to believe.  As to the former--not enough like the graphic novel, in other words--just how in the heck can a screenwriter accommodate the dark and twisted visions of Alan Moore in a two-hour Hollywood movie, anyway?",/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2006,classicsoncall,7," ""Leave one alive to tell the tale.""
","Set in a literary world, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" brings together classic fictional characters in a globe spanning adventure. However the film suffers, in my estimation, from trying to be the greatest action adventure of all time. Had the film makers spent more time on character development and motivation, the picture might have salvaged it's most intriguing premise, the team up of disparate personalities to defeat a megalomaniac who threatens the world.",/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2005,moviemanMA,6," The League of SO MUCH Potential
",Sean Connery is a very distinguished actor. He has appeared in several great films spanning decades. He was the original 007 James Bond and has since made his mark on the American Cinema. His way or presenting a line is uncanny. Connery is a real hero. His character Allan Quartermain is no different.,/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2020,kosmasp,7," Troubled (""Gentle"")men
","Most of the characters here are anything but Gentle ... but then again, if you think about how troubled the production was (how come there is no behind the scenes documentary?), the end result could have been a lot worse. Don't get me wrong: considering the characters put into the mix here, this could have been a really great movie too. But its too muddled, CGI has aged badly, acting and story choices are predictable and sometimes just plain bad ... but you can overlook these if you want to.",/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2019,nogodnomasters,8," CALL ME ISHMAEL
","This is a superhero movie that takes place in 1899 utilizing numerous fictional characters from that era, some more obscure than others. The main character, Allan Quatermain, played by Sean Connery, would become the model for Indiana Jones. The movie takes some liberties with the characters. For instance Mr. Hyde has been transformed into ""The Hulk."" There is a list of fine actors which in itself makes the movie a worth while view. Even the minor characters are names from old novels.",/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv

","The picture is developed about a fictitious Victorian Age epoch in a alternate European world war . In Venice there's a worldwide congress , the leaders are threaten and a motley group of literature heroes are called to avoid it ; thus , there appear : Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery) of the book , King Solomon's Mines (H.R.Haggard) ; Dr. Jekyll and Mr.Hyde (Jason Fleming) of Robert Louis Stevenson ; captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Sha) of 20.000 leagues of underwater journey by Jules Verne ; Mina Harker (Peta Wilson) of Dracula by Bram Stoker ; Dorian Gray (Stuart Towsend) by Oscar Wilde , Tom Sawyer (Shane West) of Mark Twain and even a Ismael (Terry O'Neill) of Moby Dick (Herman Melville) and Dr.Moriarty of Sherlock Holmes' books by Arthur Conan Doyle .",/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2008,zardoz-13,10," Sean Connery's best action movie since ""The Rock""
","The improbable logistics of the exciting new Sean Connery science fiction adventure saga ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" won't stand up to scrutiny. Meaning, moviegoers who nit-pick at flicks probably won't appreciate this special effects laden extravaganza. For example, when our intrepid heroes cruise into Venice, Italy, circa 1899, aboard the fabulous submarine 'the Nautilus' of ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" fame, they should have run aground. Under actual circumstances, those scenic Venetian canals don't draw enough water to accommodate a sub. Later, Tom Sawyer of Mark Twain's ""Tom Sawyer"" performs the impossible as he races along straight stretches of street in Venice. You can wheel around in circles without accident, but those claustrophobic Venetian roads aren't straight enough for him to pull off those ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" stunts. Indeed, virtually everything in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" qualifies as wholly unbelievable, so hard-core realists won't buy a bit of this outlandish, over-the-top, 19th century nonsense. Nevertheless, part of the charm of this imaginative Victorian-era ""X-Men"" is its name-dropping line-up of literary characters, its hopelessly preposterous heroics, and its futuristic gadgets far ahead of their time.",/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv

10 January 2004,rps-2,6," James Bond (on acid) in the nineteenth century
","Okay. It's an interesting idea for a movie. Choose famous characters from Victorian literature and weave them into a story thats part fantasy, part comedy, part adventure. And it's well done. Very well done. But it becomes tedious after the first few explosions of special effects and outbreaks of fistfights,  swordfights and gunfights. Maybe it's sensory overload but after an hour I started looking at my watch. The kids probably will like it. It's almost a movie comic book and the violence is of the BAM BASH KAPOW variety with more fun than fury. You almost expect to see those little dialogue baloons over the characters. And of course anything with Sean Connery in it is worth seeing. He gets better as he gets older.",/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2003,preppy-3,7," Turn off your mind and you'll enjoy it
","A bunch of fictional characters (Mina Harker, Captain Nemo, Allan Quatermain, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dorian Gray, Tom Sawyer) are called together in 1899 to combat a madman who threatens to take over the world.",/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2005,lemon_magic,7," Reasonably good adaptation of a eccentrically interesting story
","LXG (as the logo on the promotional posters for this movie would have it) is a serious attempt at bringing an interesting and unusual concept from the comics to the silver screen. It ain't ""Spider-Man"" or ""X-Men"", nor does it try to be, because the attitude and atmosphere come from an entirely different sensibility. I think that's perhaps why the film met with such mixed reactions; the strength of your favorable reaction to LXG probably is in direct proportion to your enthusiasm for nostalgia-based entertainment and Victorian-era story telling conventions. And for the mindset of Alan Moore, one of today's most eccentric and unusual graphic story authors (only Neil Gaiman comes close). ",/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2004,dbborroughs,10," No, its not the Comic
","Most people were upset that this film did not live up to the reputation for Moore and O'Neill's very over rated first comic book series, which is sad since taken on its own its a good little action film.",/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2003,brad12d3,," It's a fun movie don't take it too seriously though.
","One of the biggest complaints people seem to make about movies is it's unbelievability. I am a huge movie buff, and I can't help but to critique a movie while I am watching it. Now if I am watching a movie that is supposed to be based on a true story or is meant to depict real situations.. or really anything that is meant to be taken seriously, I will be very picky about details and how it was done. However, I understand that there are movies that are made strictly to be fun. L.O.E.G. is not Schindler's List, it is meant to be entertaining.. (eye candy as some would put it), so to say that you didn't like it because the plot or simply the things they did or had were unbelievable seems very strange to me considering that it is based on some of the most unbelievable but well liked fictional characters we have known. So it is believable that an invisible man, a vampire, a man that can suddenly change physical form to become a giant beast joining forces with a few other people included is believable,... but giving them extraordinary technology and putting them in extraordinary situations is going to far? If you don't like these kind of movies then don't watch them.... I however do enjoy watching movies with cool special effects, as well as the more serious and artistic films. The movie delivered what it was meant to deliver, and that is some very stunning visuals,... come on really,.. what did you expect? League is a fun movie to watch, it's not going to be nominated for Best Picture or anything like that, but if your looking to escape reality and experience a quite stunning fantasy world with some pretty cool characters then you might rent it. Not too bad.",/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2004,videomaniac,," Enjoyable!
","I was very pleased with this movie. There are some who have claimed that those who enjoy this film have a low IQ. I see no reason why a person can't have a high IQ and enjoy an imaginative and fun film. For years I have enjoyed the works of Doyle, Wilde, Stevenson, Stoker, Twain, Haggard, Wells, Poe, and Verne. I went into this film hoping it would do their characters justice. It did. Some prefer the ""original"" versions of these characters by Alan Moore. I prefer the way they were written by their creators. The characters are closer to their literary selves in the film version than in the comic book. I was very happy about that. I grew up with these characters and they played a huge part in my childhood fantasy life. Other girls may have pretended to be Wonder Woman, but I was Captain Nemo! I was hoping that LXG captured the imaginative world that flourished in my young mind when I read all those old beloved books. LXG delivered! This is a fun escapist fantasy and all of my favorite literary characters are in great form. I had a truly wonderful time watching LXG. It's a fun adventure that requires that you bring your inner child along for the ride. My inner child loved it. I loved it too!",/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2003,madmaxmedia,," The Ultimate Boy's Movie
","I enjoyed this movie despite its various flaws and lack of depth. It reminded me of old adventure movies when I was a boy, with exotic locales and characters, and lots of dramatic fights and adventure. In that way the movie was strangely nostalgic for me. That being said, a movie didn't need much sophistication or depth to capture my imagination when I was a boy, so take that as you will (it probably doesn't take much even now!)",/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv

Guys theses days don´t know who Dorian Gray was, for them he was just a girly stupid foe, not to say that they had no idea who Alan Quartermain was nor Mina Harker.

28 July 2004,lotsafun,10," a ripping yarn indeed!
","I loved LXG! Oddly enough it seems to have confused some people. They couldn't figure it out at times. I had no problem following this flick. I love fun comic book styled stuff and LXG entertained the crap out of me. I also love the works of Verne, Wells, Haggard, Doyle, Twain, Wilde, and Stevenson. You can see why LXG really flipped my switch. I'm not sure why some people couldn't follow this. Some didn't know what to do with the info that Nemo had been a pirate. It's all been covered by Mr Verne folks. I'm not sure why some didn't know what to do with the info that Mina and Dorian had been an item. That was news to me too, but I didn't find that to be confusing at all. Can't we just learn things about these characters and not have every detail represent an even deeper meaning? This isn't extremely deep stuff folks. Some people seem to need to rip everything to shreds instead of enjoying the experience. This is not the book of Revelation or Citizen Kane. This is a good time escapist flick. LXG is cool, likable, and fun. Works for me.",/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2003,Carebear-1982,7," a fun movie
","I found this movie wonderfully predictable.  To most people that may not make sense, but I have read most of the books that these characters were taken from.  While there were major differences between the characters and the books they were taken from, for the most part it was like seeing old friends, i knew what the various characters would do becuase they kept the proper personalities.  I even figured out who the villian was because I noticed one of the major works of victorian literature that was missing from the movie. And you do not need to have read all of these books to understand the movie, but there is a bit of a lack of character developement that you may find, but my friends who hadn't done the reading also enjoyed the movie.",/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2003,sithvol,10," Get over it people...this is a fun movie
","Ok, I've read the negative reviews and I must say this....alternate reality....anyone heard of this concept? You do realize these characters never really existed right? This is a fun movie that doesnt have to have every single plot point explained ad nauseam. Bravo to the filmmakers for not spending 3/4 of the film explaining back history on these characters (NOTE If you are having trouble with this concept...read a book!) This film was ten times the movie that the overhyped Matrix Reloaded and the god awful Hulk was....oh and by the way; Mister Hyde was a much better Hulk than the Hulk was as well. A very enjoyable movie that I would score 8/10",/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't know why some people have a problem with this movie.  Are they just dumb?!  I know everyone has their opinion and that just fine but reading some reviews it seems that people are just taking this movie WAY too seriously.  The movie doesn't take itself seriously so why should the public.  IT'S FANTASY PEOPLE!!!!  You know; not real.  It's not supposed to be the uplifting, heart warming, life affirming movie of the year.  It's just supposed to be fun and that is exactly what it is.",/review/rw0861671/?ref_=tt_urv
