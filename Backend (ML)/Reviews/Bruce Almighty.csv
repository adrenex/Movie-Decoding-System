25 July 2018,grantss,5," Has its moments but generally mediocre
","Teenagers in the small Pennsylvania town of Hemlock Grove are being murdered by a strange beast. The townsfolk believe it is a werewolf. To them, this makes the prime suspects the local gypsies, and Peter Rumancek in particular. He steadfastly denies that he is the murderer but he harbours a dark secret...he is a werewolf.",/review/rw3063268/?ref_=tt_urv

","So season 1 started out pretty interestingly. A mystery, some gory murders, good effects, nice characters, very cool music. I should have seen it coming...",/review/rw3063268/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2021,tchitouniaram,8," Strange...
","The only thing I've expected starting to watch this show, is couple of episodes-boredom, distaste , quit , forget. Unexpectedly ,I've gotten so engrossed in it ,that didn't even notice, that the first season ended and I've started on the second!!! It is not for everybody , it is somewhat strange show , but it is masterfully takes over your mind and time ,without you even being aware of it! Definitely recommended!",/review/rw3063268/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2016,deloudelouvain,8," Highly addictive
","For once they make a series without milking it till the last drop. Three seasons was perfect for Hemlock Grove. Never in the three seasons you get that milking feeling like with so many other series. This one keeps you interested from the beginning till the end. And even though it's again about vampires and lycanthropes you can't compare it with that garbage that is Twilight. This one is so much better, without having a lot of vampire and werewolf shots. The absolute star to me is Famke Janssen. Besides her natural beauty and elegance she shows us that she is also an excellent actress. The other star to me is her fictional son Bill Skarsg√•rd that also gave an excellent performance. The other actors are good as well but to me the whole show turns around Olivia and Roman Godfrey. I truly enjoyed every single second of Hemlock Grove. Once you start watching this show it becomes immediately highly addictive.",/review/rw3063268/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2013,onetogrowon,3," a vampire, by any other name, still sucks
","Welcome to Hemlock Grove, where there are werewolves, vampires, and high schoolers, smoking, drinking and sexing,(at home, at school, and everywhere between) with the impunity and caviler of a 40 something Hugh Hefner.",/review/rw3063268/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2017,kiramarie,2," Meh
","It's truly terrible. I haven't read the book(s) so I don't know how it compares but it breaks its own rules in the universe that it created, for one. The acting is hit and miss. Maybe the characters are supposed to also let their native accents slip? A lot? It gets much worse in the third season. Speaking of the third season, it's a travesty and doesn't know where it wants to go or who it wants to be. Just throw it at a wall and see what sticks. On top of that, let's just smear it with incest and pedophilia for good measure.",/review/rw3063268/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2013,xhidden99,4," Is it going anywhere or is it just mood and monologues?
","I guess it's a generational thing where shows that don't go anywhere, have almost nothing in the way of plot or story and exist simply by endlessly teasing that something might happen right around the corner are hot with someone now. I get the creepy feeling that this will be this year's ""The Killing"", which would have made a pretty good 3 ep miniseries but as a series it was possibly the most boring frustrating thing ever. I suspect Hemlock Grove will be that. I've only watched 3 or 4 eps and so far it's a lot of agonized 25 year olds playing agonized highschoolers. Being all full of doubt and angst. There's the creepy vaguely sexually confused rich kid, the creepy trailer trash kid and his even creepier, some would say incestuous mom though it's not clear. There's some middle aged rich parents and some girls who may or may not be creepy or The Madonna or mutants or who knows what. And then there's the Uber Creepy Rich White Matriarch. By the way, if Charlize Theron can act w/o her native accent, then Famke Janssen should be able to too.",/review/rw3063268/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2013,Rose_strffen,10," Witty, spooky, moody, gory. What more could you want!
","This show is a great addition to Netflix's stable of shows. Each episode is well written, with characters that are fully fleshed out. You care about what happens to the main characters and want to root for them. One reviewer mentioned that people don't really speak like they do in this show. Who cares! The witty dialog adds levity during some dark moments in the show and adds to the storyline and the dynamics between the characters. So few Networks create material for their Horror SciFi fans. If they do, the show usually lasts only 1 season. Bravo to Netflix for taking a chance on this show and posting the entire first season rather than making us wait each week for the next episode.",/review/rw3063268/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2013,Aptosblue,9," Stop Comparing This Show!
","I can't help but find it funny that everyone that has written a review has been comparing it to other shows. If you go into this show expecting it to be like House of Cards, you are not going to like it. Same with comparing it to other Sci-fi TV series'. It's comparing Apples and Oranges.",/review/rw3063268/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2014,Ladym265,5," Has potential, but seems confused.
","To me, Hemlock Grove is like a gorgeous dress that doesn't quite fit. You'll wear it anyway because you love the idea of it so much, but you'll always be aware that it just doesn't look as great as it could. ",/review/rw3063268/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2013,Rathko,4," Unexpectedly Awful
","I'm a fan of horror/suspense and really want the Netflix original programming experiment to succeed. I loved 'House of Cards' and am one of the handful of people in the world who actually likes Eli Roth. Which is to say; I had high hopes of ""Hemlock Grove"". I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed.",/review/rw3063268/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2022,dudewholikesthepits,3," Started Solid
","This series started solid. The first season, which follows the book, was good. The werewolf change was one of the best and most creative I've seen. The characters weren't perfect, but the show was worth watching. Then came season 2. Not nearly as good, but the cliffhanger ending was a good hook. THEN...Season 3. This season felt like they not only hired new writers, but they hired new writers who had never seen S1 or S2 and specifically forbid them from doing so. The cliffhanger was a side note. The characters were out of character. Nothing fit the tone or the mythology or the character relationships. And that ending.... Really?",/review/rw3063268/?ref_=tt_urv

21 April 2013,plasticanimalz,3," Ugh, this was a total waste of my time
","I thought the pilot episode was bad, but it had some intrigue and so I pushed on to a second episode. There are just so many problems, and major problems with this show, stuff you normally don't see on television but more frequently see in bad B movies. First of all, the main 'kids' look 25 and so it took me a moment to realize they're in high school. This would be fine if we we're in the '80s but these days casting at least tries to look accurate. 2nd, I don' like the message that lesbians are prostitutes who end up getting killed by men in the shape of powerful beasts, in front of their lovers. Really? Not only that but killed in a way to make them suffer through the whole thing. Really? Grow up. The only thing I would say is actually good in this show is the music. It makes it seem like the show should be good...but it's just not. The acting is SO bad. Who would make the decision that Fammka Jansen, a Dutch woman should use an English accent when it's not even her first language? You can see and hear her struggling to keep in character while she does this ridiculous, affected accent and character. Any good director would tell her to stop or never tell her to do that in the first place. And since I've always liked Fammka's work in the past I would have to blame the director on this one especially since the actors kept doing these ridiculous overacting moments with ridiculous dialogue. My biggest problem is that the director seems to have no sense of humanity, so the things the characters say and do are sometimes confusing or just doesn't make sense. It's like a puppeteer forcing people to do things they would never do or say in real life. The show is slow, and not in a good way, with very little to no reward or payoff. Also, the experts, like the police or scientists come to these conclusions that are all very speculative and not expert like at all. Like, the cop saying the dead girl's phone being on was like the killer wanting her lover to overhear it? The victim dropped her phone and the phone turned on. The killer had nothing to do with that. And how did the cop know the victim's relation with this person? A teacher is not going to admit that she is having an affair with an underage high school student and they didn't even address that at all. This show is boring with some interesting moments that go nowhere, and a lot of ridiculous moments. I feel more like I'm peeking in on the mind of a director who is a 12-yr-old man child, narcissist and sociopath, who can't develop characters because he has no understanding of emotions or of what humans do or say, and everything centers around gratuitous sex and gross-out moments. The show is just juvenile and amateur. I had hopes, since the trailer looked good, that Eli Roth would have made some improvements in his career rather than his schlocky, B movies that somehow get big budgets. Instead, this is more of his same old thing. He is one of the worst directors of the past decade. He's not Uwe Bowel bad, but he's close. All he really is is a SkiniMax director who throws in gore, 'cause it's his fetish. Seriously, watch an old SkinMax movie. Bad acting and a weak plot that revolves around random, gratuitous sex that doesn't move the story forward in any way. And he clearly didn't get laid as a kid and is still bitter about it, so, all his female characters are either evil, prostitutes, monsters, or, of course, the quintessential virgin that he bludgeons, tortures, or rips them apart in his films. Seriously, the dude needs therapy to work out his 'women issues,' not a film camera and a platform that says, ""I was a teenage loser and can't move beyond it."" Ladies are your friend, not your problem. You're your problem. Therapy, dude.",/review/rw3063268/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2013,km2442,," Mysterious, spooky and Awesome!
","I'm not really in to making comparisons but this show sort of feels like Carnivale the way it's unfolding and telling you it's visual tale. There is some carnage, but it isn't as brutal as you would expect coming from Roth. Mostly it feels wonderfully strange, like a world you can't help but feel drawn in to. I've only watched the pilot so far, but I love that all the episodes are right there, one right after the next for immediate consumption! That is awesome. There is much going on below the surface and I can't wait to see how it unfolds. It's definitely a show worth watching. I'm looking forward to hopefully a second season, and more Netflix originals!",/review/rw3063268/?ref_=tt_urv

16 April 2014,boydwalters,2," Wannabee True Blood but without the humour sexiness or intelligence
","The good points ... Famke is fabulous as ever though gord knows what the accent is about ... Landon Liboiron shows promise ... The head cop ... The doctor at the tower and Godfrey's wife are good ... And Lili Taylor more or less makes up for her disgraceful performance in The Conjuring :))) ... Its decently shot and edited ... However ... This is some of the worst writing I have ever seen ... They obviously went for True Blood, but couldn't manage the humour, sexiness and clever playfulness of the plot and character ... The whole thing is a shambles and the ""climax"", which takes place over the last 2 episodes ( !!! ) ,is just a farcical sprawling mess that tries to cram in everything including the kitchen sink in an effort to make it interesting and fails dismally There is also some corkingly bad acting ... Most of the actors are Hollywood brat kids that have the depth of a puddle after a light shower ... Vacuous ... Its the only word ... Unfortunately that goes for 2 of the major characters as well ... Bill Skarsgard and Dougray Scott are an absolute chore to have to watch and give some of really shoddy performances The best word to describe this really is silly ... It goes nowhere and you don't care about anything that's happening ... Because its so badly written Apparently there's going to be a second series :)))) ... What a joke",/review/rw3063268/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2014,cafm,1," Monumentally ridiculous ...
","There is nothing in Hemlock Grove that hasn't been done to death. Thus it is that this Netflicks produced series relies on all manner of predictable clich√©s, tedious dialogue and an uninteresting narrative. What's worse is that your average horror aficionado is so familiar with the tropes, which build so painfully slowly, and the ""reveals"" which are hardly surprising, that it verges on insufferable. There are some moments of interesting special effects that indulge in the goo and gore, and its nice not to be saddled with CGI laden special effects (too bad for those Gen Y viewers who confuse CGI for reality and think that everything not digitised looks fake) I suppose for fans of Twilight this sort of horror - cushioned as it between huge mundane moments of poorly written melodramatic dialogue - is just the ticket. Not for this little black duck.",/review/rw3063268/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2019,pchiodootr,3," Sorry we can't rate individual seasons. (Minor spoilers)

5 August 2014,dbelkau,1," Rubbish
","I don't know where to begin. This is most certainly one of if not the most haphazard, disarticulated TV production I have ever endured. Did Roth even know he was producing this drivel? The plot plods along at an excruciating, molasses pace. I honestly believe the dialogue was written on a fridge with magnets. There is not one believable, well developed character to be found. The hodgepodge of horror idioms the producers threw against the wall definitely did not stick. The series has no idea what it wants to be. Is it campy? Is it skewed perspective? Is it horror porn? Who knows? The 17 year old teens' conversations produce about one sentence in 100 that one could believe was spoken by a high school student. One of them drinks and smokes like Hemingway. Half the time he dresses like him as well. I made it through most of season one in the hopes that it wily be salvaged by some miraculous intervention. Doesn't happen. I ran out of comedic material to keep myself interested around S:1 E:8. Hemlock is pure garbage.",/review/rw3063268/?ref_=tt_urv
