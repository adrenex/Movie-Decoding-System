7 January 2012,classicsoncall,9," ""Has anything you've done made your life better?""
","I've seen a lot of movies and have seen a lot of violence in them - war films, Westerns, horror and even some of those slasher/gore flicks that go so way over the top. For the most part, the violence depicted is far removed from any sense of reality, because after all, it's a movie and the director can be as unrealistic as he wants to get with flying bodies, severed limbs and the like. However the curb stomp by Edward Norton's character on the black hood in the street was probably as visceral an experience that one can get from simply watching the event on screen. I think that comes from internalizing the impact such a trauma can have if it was personally done to you. It's a little hard to put into words, but I hope you can catch my meaning.",/review/rw3513484/?ref_=tt_urv

1 February 2009,alexkolokotronis,10," The Most Dangerous Person To Us Is Ourselves
","American History X is a movie of its own. It has a little bit of everything in the way it touches you. This of course making it a very though provoking film. There isn't a genre you can place this film in because it is a not a crime story, action or even a simple drama instead it is a humanistic thriller. What it is about, is the battle over ourselves.",/review/rw3513484/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2005,seventhsamurai1954,10," Changed My Life.
","American History X really opened my eyes to the world of racism and how cruel human beings can be sometimes. This story follows a violent extreme skin-head (Norton) that spends three years in jail for killing two black people and how he changed through jail. He then tries to help his younger brother, who idolizes him, not to go down the same path he did. You really can't find a more powerful movie than this. This movie forces you to open your eyes through harsh realism and although some things are disturbing, it makes you take notice. Everything about this movie is so incredible I can't even find words for it. All I can say is that if you have not seen this movie, it really is a must to see because it teaches you something and is really powerful.",/review/rw3513484/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2013,Leofwine_draca,8," Gutsy and compelling
","American History X is a real surprise, a searing look at racism in America today, told from the point of view of members of a skinhead gang. It's a lengthy film that's punctuated with moments of unflinching brutality, and yet it keeps you hooked to the screen throughout. And the reason for that? Edward Norton. Norton burns up the screen in this film; he's even better than he was in FIGHT CLUB, his big break-out picture. He somehow makes his Neo-Nazi character frightening, compelling and sympathetic in equal measure, a fully realised human being rather than a caricature. Furlong isn't bad, and supporting players like Gould and Keach are great, but let's not kid ourselves here. This is Norton's movie, and he owns it.",/review/rw3513484/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2004,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," Why can't we just stop hating each other?
","This movie, got to me! I mean got under my skin got to me. It is so effective, the performances were just perfect. We have Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, two fine actors, they play two skin head Nazi racist brothers who are very violent. We start off at a very disturbing scene where we see how Edward Norton's character is put in jail for killing an African American very violently. When he comes back, he has just learned so much that no school, no white man could ever teach him: self respect, respect for others, respect for life, for his family, and knowing that ""We can't live our lives p*ssed off"". He is touched when he learns that his brother's teacher is asking him to write a paper about racism and how it effects today's society called ""American History X"". But when Eddie just gives a wrong look to the black kid in school, some things go terribly wrong.",/review/rw3513484/?ref_=tt_urv

","American History X is one of the most powerful movies released in years. Not since Schindler's List has the subject of racism been so potently presented. The use of black and white cinematography to portray painful flashbacks is amazing, and the settings, while not necessarily pretty, fit the story flawlessly. ",/review/rw3513484/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2006,exa56,10," A masterpiece! Truly one of the best film I have ever seen
","I have been wanting to see this movie for a long time, since my English teacher mentioned it in our class in grade ten. Gosh I wished I wouldn't have waited all this time to finally watch it, although maybe it's a good thing cause I would have probably been a little bit more traumatized at 14... This movie is exceptional!!! Makes u think, makes you frustrated, makes you wanna scream and even makes you cry! Edward Norton is just phenomenal playing the role of a freak skin head and even more so playing this skin head who finally realizes how stupid he was and tries to protect his younger brother. Edward Furlong also does an amazing job!!! This film is moving in so many ways...I can't even describe how real and heartfelt it felt. I definitely think Edward Norton should have won the Oscar for his performance, cause he was absolutely terrific! I can't get why they didn't gave it to him... This movie will surely stay on my mind for a while now... just thinking that some place in the world things like that still happen...it crushes my heart. This is a wonderful movie that every single person should see at least once in his life... Watch American History X, it totally worth it!",/review/rw3513484/?ref_=tt_urv

18 February 2019,Hitchcoc,10," So Mind Bending
","Sometimes it's hard, as a viewer, to even watch something like this. It is inundated with scenes of horror and violence. If one simply passes off the idea of doing a movie about the ugliest side of humanity and then put it in our laps. The performances are outstanding and a moral commitment is made. Some would say to the worst of the worst, there is a glorification of the events through flashback that may be seen as sort of cool. This is a small price for me to pay, but I have to admit, I would not do well with a continuous diet of such darkness.",/review/rw3513484/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2021,mark.waltz,10," I don't feel angry. I just feel disgust.
","Is this what has happened to society? I can watch something like this, even being a 20+ year old film, and feel nothing? No fear, no hatred, no sympathy, no caring, just nothing, as if novocaine has been shot into my heart. That's the power of cinema that I don't really want to see but when I do, I am amazed how well done it is. It's not the film I despise. It's that feeling I get of emotions I list above that I just don't feel when I read this in the papers, see on the evening news or on the street, or in this case, see on my TV as a movie.",/review/rw3513484/?ref_=tt_urv

","""American History X"" is a bold and disturbing movie about family, racism and our own self-perceptions.

","''American History X''is one of the most amazing movies I watched in my life! My dad gave me the tape to watch, and after almost 2 weeks of laziness to watch this movie, I finally watched it 2 times! First, I need to say that both Edwards( Norton and Furlong)are great!

16 July 2007,Movie_Buff_Brad,10," One of the best films about racism
","One of the reasons I like the film is that the racism isn't shoved down your throat. It's subtle and believable. There's no characters standing around screaming about ""Those goddamn Mexicans, I don't want THEM changing my locks so THEY can rob the place with their little essays!"", right in front of them.

22 October 2019,DanielStephens1988,9," Beautiful film about how hatred will never resolve the problem
","The tragedy of evil is that in trying to stop it, you create it. So if you want to stop doing evil actions, you also have to stop seeing evil because to see evil you must project evil... therefore, you create evil. If you genuinely want to be moral, you got to make a counterintuitive move of giving up all morality. All of your moral rules give them all away. Only then you will truly be moral but if you go around touting your morality, and telling people how moral you are and how immoral they are, that immediately tells that you're not embodying your morality. A genuinely moral person would never do that because true morality is not based on rules, it's not a self-image that you adopt, it's not a list of 10 commandments that you follow. When you think you're so righteous and so moral, you will go and kill people in the name of your morality which is precisely what creates evil.",/review/rw3513484/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2006,jmchnwth,10," This is a fantastic movie....
","This is a fantastic movie because no matter what side you're on in life, this movie shows them all, good and bad, right or wrong. I also agree with the point in the movie that proves that people can change for the better and straighten things out in their head to do the right things in life. Yes, things in our world have changed, some for the good, some for the bad, but just because you might not agree with some of it, doesn't mean you can play God and try to make things ""your way"" and this shows exactly what happens when you try. This movie talks about all walks of life and the struggles we all have in what beliefs are right and wrong. Yes this movie is brutal and violent, but also truthful to the past and unfortunately still sometimes the present. This movie is about race, but not only 1 race is singled out and fed to the dogs, they all are. So, go into this movie with an open mind and your mind will come out full.",/review/rw3513484/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2006,planktonrules,9," exceptionally powerful drama--but not for the kids
","I really appreciated how those associated with this excellent film refused to pull any punches in showing the life of a young skin-head so ably portrayed by Edward Norton. Instead of creating a caricature of a racist, all the vile language and violence is shown. This DEFINITELY makes this a movie NOT for KIDS, but for adults it makes a strong impact--like a right cross into the jaw! Now I know some adults will also be completely turned off by this as well, but considering how slimy and awful racism is, how can you talk about it other than by exposing it as it really is?! I applaud the efforts, though I must also admit it can VERY hard to watch--particularly the shooting scene and the intensely graphic language.",/review/rw3513484/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 1998,Ari-21,10," This was probably the best movie I've ever seen
","I honestly don't think I have ever seen a better movie than American History X in my entire life! I may only be 14, but I have seen a lot of movies. I am an avid fan of them, and this one just takes the cake. Edward Norton is just unbelievable. He is the most talented actor I've ever laid eyes on. His performance in the movie is phenomenal. He delves so deep into his character that he can convince the whole audience easily of his neo-nazi role. The look on his face as he walks back from killing one man in the first seen is purely horrifying. The entire move was dramatic, intriguing, and powerful. It really is moving and emotional as well as scary. It is so true to life, and provides the viewer with such insight into the life and events that create a monster such as Derek Vinyard. It answers many questions I have long awaited an answer to such as what could possibly make someone act as Derek did in this movie, yet left open-ended many others that people such as myself may have. Almost every single scene in the movie was extremely captivating. I can't even go on to say more about the acting, other than if Edward Norton does not win best actor this year, I will go absolutely nuts. It's bad enough he lost it to Cuba Gooding Jr. when he was in Primal Fear, which was yet another incredible performance by him. Edward Furlong, the little kid from T2 is astounding as the confused brother of Derek. I was stunned walking out of the theater after seeing American History X, and I don't think I will ever have the benefit of seeing another movie as good as this one as long as I live. I recommend anyone with a good tolerance for violent and graphic depictions go see this movie. I am bewildered as to why director Tony Kaye would ever want out of this success. If I were to rate this movie, as I often do for others in reviewing them for school, I would give it an A+ with all of my heart.",/review/rw3513484/?ref_=tt_urv

","splendid performances. powerful message. violent. realistic. obvious, a masterpiece. the force of this film becomes, decade by decade, more important. because it is not exactly a great film presenting a delicate theme in wise manner but a kind of guide for understand every day reality. it is not only a problem of racism or an American story but an impressive fresco of the challenges to meet the other. this is the key of its importance. the splendid performance of Edward Norton represents start point for self definition of each of film viewer. the tragic end is the most precise warning about the social expectation and the importance of the past in the social status perception. it is a special film for the virtue to represent a slice of reality. and this does it one of the films who could change its public.",/review/rw3513484/?ref_=tt_urv
