10 November 2020,Supermanfan-13,9," Stephen Amell was perfect as Green Arrow!
",Arrow is absolutely the best of the CW DC shows (except Smallville). The show had its ups and downs throughout its run but it was still an overall really good show and the last season was one of the best! Stephen Amell was absolutely perfect as Green Arrow/Oliver Queen! I'm really going to miss this show!,/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Still the best of the Arrowverse!
",Arrow is absolutely the best of all the CW DC shows (except Smallville). The show had its ups and downs throughout its run but it was still overall a really good show and after a few down seasons it ended with the last season being one of the best! It tells the story of billionaire playboy Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) as he returns a changed man after the world presumed him dead when his yacht sank at sea. He becomes the vigilante Green Arrow and tries to clean up the city. He starts off by himself by slowly puts a team together as they fight to put away criminals in Star City. Amell was absolutely perfect as Green Arrow/Oliver Queen! I'm really going to miss this show!,/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv

10 July 2022,drjgardner,9," Guilty Pleasure
","This series has everything you could wish for - action, drama, romance, and did I say action. Lots of action series devolve into novellas, spending endless time on the interpersonal lives of the people and ignoring the police, fire, detective, military, or whatever source the series has. This series keeps the action going. And the acting is wonderful and the cinematography is also wonderful. The martial arts is wonderful. The only problem with the series is the flashbacks that seem out of sync with the storyline.",/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv

",Team arrow is pretty lame. It's like they went from a show for adolescents and adult to a show for kids,/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2022,oscarjneklund,7," Good! üèπ
","I find it better than its ""brother"" show The Flash. Absolutely blown away with the first and second season, the third and four I liked to. But then it went protracted. At a moment, I couldn't stand watching this anymore so I can't judge rest of the seasons.",/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2020,POIguy,9," A new era of superhero shows begins!
","Arrow began the Arrowverse, one of the most popular TV superhero universes. Unfortunately some of its spin-offs aren't the best, however, Arrow remains a pretty solid show. Arrow is pretty weird because it got pretty good, then got kind of crappy, then got great again, then got crappy, and finally got good again.",/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2022,russell-ga,9," Good Popcorn Entertainment
","Arrow is excellent, but mindless, entertainment. It's a soap opera with action. Our heroes are likable and vulnerable. Their goals are sometimes obscure. But it's a fun way to pass the time.",/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2020,abdiluqman-47593,10," Good Show Overall
","Everyone knows the first 3 seasons were pure masterclass,it fails in the fourt season but it comes back to life with deathstroke in sn 5 Ricardo Diaz was a perfect villain in 6 but should have died sooner,7 was okay and 8 was a bittersweet ending.Thank you Stephen Amell.",/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2021,18Buddha,10," This was my favourite Comic Hero show
",The acting is amazing I love The actor who portrays oliver Queen. Also the action in the show is top of the line! Their fight sequences during big boss fights often seem like something from a movie. Very well co-ordinated and the way the camera pans from 1 character fighting to the next and to the next all the while their all in the same big battle is awesome.,/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2019,Darkside-Reviewer,9," Part of something bigger
","Arrow was the start of a series of shows that was later dubbed as the Arrowverse all the shows stories connect in one shared universe and include some of the best characters in the DC roster including Green Arrow, The Flash, Supergirl, Deathstroke, Ra's Al Ghul and many many more as the shows became bigger and more complex.",/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2019,iliasalk,6," I think after 6th season, arrow starts missing the target
","An excellent show till season 5. From season 6 show started to decline. Season 7 is a mess, slow, boring and totally confusing. From half season 7 episodes, production introduced some new characters to the show, the main characters sons and daughters. In an inconsistent and confusing manner and in a different timeline. Probably they decided to cancel the original show and are preparing the way for a new show ""Arrow sons 2"" in the future. I am only watching it because i am curious how they will end it.",/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2013,A_Different_Drummer,8," Great show ... if not for the Flashbacks from Hell
","Let's take a moment of mourning for the TV plot arcs of yore. Back when shows prioritized the characterizations above the action and, if indeed there was action, it took place precisely in the last 7 minutes of the episode, and was all done with before the close, giving the characters a chance to make light comic banter, close down the storyline, and give the audience a chance to go to the toilet. How many TV shows followed that formula I cannot say, but the number was in the 100s. Now all that has changed. You can now have action many times in the body of a show, it is permitted, even encouraged. And you have action even before the characterizations are fully developed. All this is positive evolution I think. But here the catch. There are no more ""closed"" story-lines. In the multi-band, multi-channel, multi-device electronic age, where viewers tend to have attention span of a hummingbird, nighttime TV has astonishingly borrowed the Rule Book of daytime soap operas and, lo!, plots never actually resolve, they just become more complex. ARROW is one of the best exponents of the new type of comic-book-derived drama, arguably as good as or even better than SMALLVILLE (which was, thematically, all over the map). Amell is great. He has a whispery kind of delivery which oddly makes what he says that much more interesting. The supporting cast is great. In fact the only thing that prevented me from giving this a ""10"" are the flashbacks. They are terrible. They are like some silent Hell the viewers must go through to get back to the actual episodes. It is almost as if the lead writer, as a small child, was locked in a closet with a DVD looping KUNG FU, and grew up to believe that you cannot advance 10 minutes of plot in the present, without 2 minutes of flashback to fortify it.",/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2019,markq-75654,9," Season 1,2 and 5 are amazing
","Season 1 and 2 of Arrow is great super hero television. This version of Oliver being more Batman like works great for the show. It's flashbacks are also great. Showing what Oliver Went through and how he became who he is. It's also provides great villains like Merlyn, Deathstroke and Prometheus.",/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2020,acedj,8," So far so good
","I am approaching the end of the second season. Let me just say I had no intentions of ever watching this.I recently finished the 5th season of the Flash and since the Arrow made several appearances on that show, I figured I would give it a go. It is not terrible, but like all shows in this genre, it is overly formulaic. The constant flash-backs are getting tired as well. I do have a problem with the women on the show. The guy that plays Oliver Queen/ The Arrow is fit, god knows his shirt is off enough throughout the series. The women are all models though, and while I am not adverse to looking at scantily clad, gorgeous women, shouldn't someone that is fighting constantly have some muscle???? Maybe I am just crazy.",/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,SaintNinja,10," I just want to defend Season 4 from harsh criticism
","It's 2022, October. I'm still in Russia. Nuclear war is closer than ever. Our crazy president Putin uses black magic - it's a well known fact here. He invited the order of black witches to Kremlin in 2017. Their evil mesa was televised and shown on the central TV. Looks familiar? Arrow even mentions my home city of Kaliningrad!)) Well, I can understand critics, maybe Season 4 is not a masterpiece by any means, but it's prophetic as hell.",/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,tadavies-15568,9," A Great Show With Rocky Places
","Arrow kickstarted the arrowverse and it should be heralded as the true kickstart of superhero TV. I truly believe without this we wouldn't have anything like the MARVEL netflix shows. While there is some rocky places in this (season 4, sesaon 7b) overall this is amazing with a brilliant cast, great action and emotional moments. Even if you don't like superheroes watch this.",/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2020,jwwalrath-227-85487,9," Love this show
",This is the one that started off the CW/DC superhero Arrowverse and is one of my favorite superhero shows.,/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2019,ThunderKing6,10," The father of superhero shows (in my opinion)
","It has some bad episodes, moments, characters, seasons, actors, flashbacks and Oliver ""Arrow"" Queen goofs. Sometimes Oliver is an excellent fighter other times he is a jobber.",/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2021,absdgbnkzztj,10," Parsa
","Arrow was a good series, but it stretched a lot and they could have finished it in four seasons, but they made eight seasons on their own.",/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2021,rileysollerud,10," My favorite show ever by far
",Extremely mild spoilers ahead,/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2021,jerepepe,9," It was a good tour.
","Arrow went in style, and looking back left us both unforgettable seasons and regular seasons, but never all bad.
It concludes by giving a good ending to almost all the protagonists that the series had over the years and a sweet ending to the path of Oliver, the creator of the now known Arrowverse",/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2018,csgollum,7," Bring back the good-ness!
","I used to love this show. When it began, the mere athleticism of Stephen Amell used to give me goosebumps and I would have rated it an 8, even 9. But with the passing of time (I think somewhere around Season 4), the quality of writing started dropping. Actors can do only so much (and they do give their best every time) with this kind of material. Some characters have become sort of hangers on and should be put out of their misery.",/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2020,Yossy_yan,9," Thank you for 8 beautiful seasons
","I've been watching this series since episode 1.
From the beginning i loved it, and even more when they started with the arrow univers.
Although it has some down, the ups were much more.
It was filled with action, drama, laughing and crying and I'm so sad it's over.",/review/rw5447042/?ref_=tt_urv
