","""Felicity"" is a show that doesn't come along very often. In this year's humdrum of boring freshman shows and networks trying to squeeze ratings out of old worn out sitcoms on their last legs, Felicity comes across as a refreshing journey. Felicity is somewhat of a lost soul, her father has planned out her future, pulling strings to get her into Stanford to pursue a medical career. But right after graduation, Felicity asks a guy she's been eyeing for the whole time she was in high school.... Ben Covington... to sign her yearbook. What he writes genuinely touches Felicity, so she decides to pursue Ben to NYU. Many of the plotlines of the series (at least so far) almost seem to be along the lines of something found in Melrose Place or 90210, but they are handled with a sense of care, and the series achieves poignant moments comparable only to moments spent watching movies. The whole show has a movie like quality to it, each scene looks planned, camera-work brings a little extra oomph to the scenes.... This is some of the best work I've seen on television. I can not recommend this show enough... it lives up to the buzz. Definitely among the top 5 shows on television.",/review/rw1081554/?ref_=tt_urv

","I suppose that I could write you how much this show meant much to me 20 years ago when I had some hard times, or how much I was attracted by the background music, story, characters, NY from the late '90s, or why I find it to be a true peace of art - all for season 1, and 1/2 of season 2, after which the script began to lose value abruptly.
Yet instead I will just say that re-watching this show, in 2020 during a pandemic, gives me a unique opportunity to see how the youth was living, communicating, and perceiving reality before cell phones, wide access to the internet, and all another tech. gadgets that changed our life. It's kinda traveling through time.

23 April 1999,Seb Chen,," This show is hilarious!
","I originally thought this was another ""Dawson's Creek"" type teensploitation series. I was pleasantly surprised when I laughed myself silly at this extremely well written, well acted and often touching show. Felicity Porter is a much more realistic neurotic than Ally McBeal could dream to be and far more relatable. Did I mention the show is hilarious??? Example: Felicity's boyfriend has just had a fight with his brother upon finding out he is gay and planning a commitment ceremony with a man named Alex. The two siblings storm out leaving Felicity and Alex at the table alone. Felicity meekly offers ""I'm marrying a gay guy too."" (her gay boss has asked her to marry him so he can get a green card). It may sound far fetched but well-conceived scenes like this will have you rolling. Watch it!",/review/rw1081554/?ref_=tt_urv

21 March 2005,Pegofhearts,," Loved the show except for a few things
","I absolutely loved Felicity! Although I did not watch it when it was first aired, I have watched all four seasons on DVD. The only big issues had with this show were that after the first season, I think it was they stopped having consistent sally-felicity ""tapings"". I think in season 2 felicity sent tapes to Sally, but you never heard anything back from Sally. I think for season 3, there was hardly any tapes at all! Then in season 4 you only heard Felicity sending tapes to sally again. What's up with that?Also, towards the end of season 4, it was COMPLETELY unrealistic when Ben cheated on Felicity with Claire! I mean come on- the guy goes through EVERYTHING to be with her and then just cheats on her with some dumb blonde? Ben would not do that to Felicity at that point in the show and it was really horrible that they wrote that in. Also towards the end of Season 4 when they had that whole ""back in time"" sequence, I thought that was really stupid. I mean it was just NOT felicity. I, personally am a HUGE Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan and that show is all about magic and the super natural, and I also LOVE felicity. But the thing is, the two do not collide in any way. They are completely different and they shouldn't be intertwined. I accepted it in the beginning when Meghan did those few spells on Felicity and they supposedly worked, because they were little things and it was really up to you to decide whether you thought the spells worked or not, but when they had that whole back in time thing was just too over the top- it was felicity trying to be Buffy and it wasn't pretty. I think Ben and Felicity are perfect for each other and that in the end they should be together, but the way they did it was horrible. I loved the seen when Ben came to the airport and he and felicity got back together, it was perfect. I think they should have done something like that for the ending, not felicity forgiving Ben for cheating on her like a million times. Also the whole thing about Ben getting Lauren pregnant was not so good. It was also unrealistic because since she was like 40, the chances of her getting pregnant on a one night stand were pretty slim and she was mean and TOTALLY screwed up the story line. And finally at the very end when Elena was back at the very end and when they didn't explain it was horrible. I know, I watched the DVD bonus features so I know that Matt reeves, I think it was, had to cut it out because there wasn't enough time, but this was the final episode and you can't do something that big, and not explain it. You just can't.So I am sorry I had to focus on the negatives, but there are too many positives to mention, but overall I thought Felicity was an excellent show with the above exceptions.",/review/rw1081554/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2003,tweety17,," Should have found a new guy! - (contains spoilers)
","I think this was a good show, for many of the same reasons other users have cited. However, I was rather disappointed with the ending. Although the series revolved around the love triangle between Felicity/Noel/Ben and her inability to choose between them, I felt the ending ignored what was obvious in the ""Back to the Future"" episodes - that although she loved them both, neither Ben nor Noel were the ""right one"" for her: Noel found the love of his life, and Ben once again proved unworthy of Felicity's affections through his unfaithfulness. Felicity began the series following a girlish whim - and putting her crush before her own success - and she ended it still immature, putting someone else first. I feel that the series would have remained more faithful to its premise and mature presentation of storylines if Felicity had found the strength to stand up for herself to Ben (whose actions suggest he doesn't truly respect her)and take the next step on her own, or maybe meet someone new (remember the ending of The Wonder Years?). I felt that Felicity's situation at the end of the series was sort of sad, stuck. Life opportunities are only beginning at college graduation, there are more than two guys on the planet, and I had hoped that this elegant series would have let Felicity learn that too!",/review/rw1081554/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2001,daisy3-3,," I cannot believe I got sucked in
","I think I am slightly too old as the audience that the makers of this show try to reach. I have seen previews for TV show Felicity quite a few times over the last three years (quite a few because I'm not a big fan of WB Network, otherwise I'm sure they run all the time)..Point being, for the first time, soemtime in the beginning of 2001 I finally had a chance to see one single episode of Felicity by accident...and I got sucked in into the characters' lives and their semi-pathetic problems (the foundation of the show lays in the fact the main character- Felicity is torn between two guys and then there's the additional trivial drama of the so- called problems NYU students supposedly have..). Well, put aside the anomalies  such as how do these NUY students without jobs pay for their rent and cool clothes (I mean, c'mon, there is a very weak evidence any of them have jobs and if they do they get paid minimum wage and I know NYC isn't exactly the cheapest city). Well, anyway! ... it's the second season I'm watching the show and I am amazed on how much chemistry there is between the characters of Felicity and Ben. That's some fine acting. I still think Keri Russell hasn't developed the character as much as she could have (or maybe she's not allowed to?, after all they need to keep it simple for the kids) but I also think she does the job well. She's sweet (maybe too sweet) and sincere with her facial expressions. Ben is more deep and complicated and the other guy Noel is just plain easy on the eyes. I really don't mind tuning in every Wed. night. I'm actually surprised that Aaron Spelling had noithing to do with this one.",/review/rw1081554/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2002,hugobolso-1,," started good and end horrible
","Felicity was a show about life in University. The main character was a beautiful girl who have too choice in the boy of her dreams and her soul mate. The first year was great because explain . all the university student problem, and young adult troubles (like lost the virginity, violation, obsession, relationship, ambition and frustration). the following start excellent, reinventing the show (like the ""Twilightzone"") and with more actually controversial topics  (not Russell hair cut)like the gratuity use of pill, it was also much more about Felicity than his friend  and  life in collage but end bad with a too nice  reunion of Felicity and Ben. The third one was the shorter, it was good but not long enough in that season Felicity seems very tired. However the other characters were more interesting (Elena Virgin boyfriend, the relationship of Maghan and Sean, The English girl and his violent boyfriend, the depression and goodbye of Julie, Noel's failure marriage). The last season started excellent with the leading affair with his friend. Most of the audience I think they wan to see Noel with Felicity, but the producer decide to finish with Ben.  The only good topic   of the first part was Noel depression. After Ben unfaithful, she back to the past to rescue her first love Noel. That was a funny idea but end horrible. She return to the present with Ben. Not only who choice one guy, also Elena who died in a car accident was alive with his fiancée (totally incoherent). The first season end good because the audience didn't know her choice. In the end she not only return to Ben, also she decided to stay the rest of her life with him. Most of the people wants to see in the end to see Felicity with Noel. I think that the propionate ending was a much more open mind final, where she end alone or with a third guy, because it's difficult to marry and have a nice life with your university boy/girlfriend. Maybe a good idea was when she choose Ben, then Noel left her fiancée in the church and all the story begins again. Not only end worse the whole chapter was a mess, there is not a dramatically scene between Elena (that supposed to be dead in the future) with Felicity, and the Sean Maeganhan relation end in chaos. In others time creative screenwriting's, destroy complete the end of the series with this horrible ending. That's a pity",/review/rw1081554/?ref_=tt_urv

","That's not to say that it wasn't fun it's first season, but the writing got worse and worse and I stopped watching. It was like watching some man's fantasy about what it would be like to be a young woman, I couldn't relate. And when they consumated the romance, it pretty much all fell apart. Don't people who make these shows know (see ""Cheers"") that the chemistry BEFORE they 'do it' is what makes us watch? 'Taking it to that next level' is an excuse for lazy writing.

","Here's a show that's on this side of parody and doesn't even know it.  At least some crappy dramas know they're crappy and revel in it.  At least Ally McBeal had the sense of humour to poke fun at the neurotic protagonist.  But this...this show thinks it's trying to dish out ""meaningful"" tripe.  It takes its main character too seriously, as if her love escapades could equal, say, a Tarkovsky film. It's depressing, boring, unbearably moody, and the actors...let's just say they all have the same expression for every situation: the furrowed brow, the quivered lip, BIG HONKING EYES.

7 January 2005,TxMike,," Keri Russell as Felicity in college.
","Felicity is one of the TV series that my wife and I both enjoyed. She liked the stories, I enjoyed watching the pretty college girls. Keri Russell, who got her start as a member of the Mickey Mouse gang, plays the title character, Felicity Porter. The series was loosely based on Felicity's experiences and puppy loves while in college and living in a dormitory. While many of the other cast members were older, even in their 30s, Russell really was college age during the run of the series. Starting with long, curly hair which was a signature look of sorts, she created quite a stir when she showed up with very short hair for one new season. Before this TV series, she was in a charming little movie called 'Eight Days A Week.'",/review/rw1081554/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2000,Nuala S,," Yawn.
","No matter how hard I try, I cannot get into this show.  The cast are, in general, quite talented and appear to understand their characters. Unfortunately, their characters are, well, boring.  I'd prefer to watch a group of my own friends run around in a field for an hour.  At least that may entertain me for more than five seconds.",/review/rw1081554/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2022,skyleredwards-74514,3," I feel like I got stringed along, like Noel did.
","I was hoping this show would give me like Dawson Creek vibes only more of a college focused version, but no. The first season I would say was good and then it just kept going down hill. It kept the same storylines literally every time really, I can't even count how many cheating scandals happened in this for someone to be like ""I can't forgive you"" only to get back together within a couple episodes and then have it happen yet again. The only thing that kept me watching this was the hope that Noel would get a real chance with Felicity, without her pining over Ben, but that never happened, the writers were non stop putting the vibes out there that that was going to happen and never followed through with it. But to be fair, Ben was trash and so was Felicity, who had next to no character development (except for the fact she became less of a stalker, I suppose)
And lastly, the last five episodes were completely annoying and did not make sense, I thought the whole 'magic' stuff would be one episode, but they dragged it on, just for her to stay with her cheating toxic boyfriend in the end.",/review/rw1081554/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2020,m-47826,6," Good chick flick series, ruined by the main couple.
","The direction the show took after a while, was wrong. Like the network wanted this atypical teen drama to fit the mold. Ben and Felicity was the goal, all along. Only it actually wasn't, but writers were too fixated on that idea, they forced the issue. Ad nauseam. Almost making us regret the heroine followed her heart, when so many other opportunities were offered to her. It's the first time I was convinced that, without a doubt, she should've stayed single. For a while at least. Which she apparently planned on doing, before that « fever dream ». And the confusing part following her waking up. Personally, I think the cast had a lot to do with the appeal of that show. Like a group of friends who've decided to write, star and direct their own first real television series. I loved the humor too. Season 1 is the show at its best. It's the most wholesome season of the whole series. With themes you're going to find throughout. And more believable storylines. Season 2 had the best drama, if you like that depressing tone. As well as one of my favorite episodes and cast. Season 3 is the worst, with a revamp that turned the show into a soap opera. And irritating characters, old AND new. Making Javier a regular, was a big mistake. The spark was gone once he became too involved. Season 4 is a complete mess, the series don't know what it's about anymore. With run of the mill social issues, addressed randomly (Elena's « confession », was ridiculous and insulting to the show's spirit) Or where it's leading to (those added episodes were good, but Elena couldn't be at Noel's wedding. She died before the « time travel ») But it has some interesting episodes, like The declaration, Fire, Paper chase or The Graduate, and the additional part. It's no secret this show didn't last long, mainly because of poor writing choices and inability to go outside of its comfort zone. Or not following orders?... But I still enjoy rewatching it once in a while.",/review/rw1081554/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2002,mcfly-31,7," Started off right, ended wrong
","The freshman season of this college show (pun intended, hehe) was razor sharp before segueing into some decent middle years before falling off the shelf and petering to it's finish. It all begins when 18-year-old Felicity (the beautiful Russell) decides to follow her high school crush to college in New York. The show picked up a lot of flack, as the press labeled Felicity a ""stalker"", which I felt was ridiculous. She wasn't obsessed with this guy, wasn't peering in his windows, etc. Anywho, while trying to pursue him, she finds herself attracted to the R.A. (resident advisor) who helms the dorms. A wonderful pulling match begins as she tries to decide with whom her emotions lie. This goes on the entire year in some terrificly written episodes that keep you tuning in. The second season premiere was one of the more highly anticipated ones in tv that year, revealing Felicity's choice of guy. Unfortunately, after it's reached there's a sense of ""where do we go now with the story"" which started to drag the show down. Not to mention the much talked about hacking off of Russell's hair which proved disaterous. The second year managed some good drama, as they drifted from the Felicity/Ben/Noel deal and focused on some of the other characters. The finale was a tremendous letdown from the first year as they have she and Ben watching a movie on a roof to end things. Blah. Plus a big smack to the head of the WB for their frustratingly idiotic scheduling of the show, airing it 12 weeks in a row then yanking it for four months before bringing it back! The ad naseum stage was reached for the final two years as Felicity went back and forth between the two guys until it got annoying. I stayed because of the terrific actors who I came to really like. Russell was a perfect choice for the title character, a gorgeous and sweet girl next door, even if she did lack the body for it. Speedman, a strong, young actor, delivered nicely with his even-natured Ben, though prone to his outbursts. Foley had a nice-guy goofiness about him, sometimes busting me up with a facial reaction or oddball line of dialogue. You had Johnson who hung around only for a couple years as Julie, who I guess I was indifferent about. Nothing ever really stood out about her. Supporting people were the annoying Foreman as Megan, a goth-bitch who you wanted to sock most of the time. Grunberg generated some laughs as the hapless Sean, whose collection of ideas to make money always seemed to bomb out. Easy laughs came from Gomez as Javier, a gay Latino who ran the coffee house where Russell and Speedman worked. There were an assortment of others as well, too many to get into. But Elena was ok, Richard a geeky dumbass, and Fazon the by the book virgin. Everything was wrapped up after four seasons with a truly unique, if misguided attempt at originality, storyline involving Felicity going back in time to see ""what if?"". It turns out to be yet another plot letdown as she sees everything would've worked out the same anyway. They dig up Sarah McClachlan's ""I Will Remember You"" as we watch the cast smile in slow motion one last time. So, though not an amazing show, the characters will remain some of my favorites for years to come.",/review/rw1081554/?ref_=tt_urv
