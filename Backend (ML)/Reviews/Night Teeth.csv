","What would you do, if two vampires hired you, to chauffer them around, while they bring their rivals down, in a night of butchery, would you stay or would you flee, could you accept all the carnage, maybe join their violent rampage.",/review/rw7466750/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2021,Calicodreamin,6," Aimless sexiness
","Night teeth oozed with sexiness, which is always appreciated in Vampire Noir. However, when taking a deep dive into the plot, it was a bit aimless and lacked depth. Almost like arriving at a game already in progress and leaving before it finishes.",/review/rw7466750/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2021,Draysan-Jennings,5," Nothing special
",It started out ok but about halfway in it got a little boring. Some of long drawn out meaningless dialouge between Benny and Blaire almost put me to sleep. I wouldn't say it's the worst vampire movie out there and its definitely not the best. It's basically just another mediocre vampire film. 5 stars.,/review/rw7466750/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,SnoopyStyle,5," trying to be another cool vampire movie
",Vampires exist but they have kept their existence a secret except for a select group. They made an agreement with the human authorities. They agree not to kill and drink from only those who consent. They have become rich and powerful while living the high life during the nights. Benny (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) is reckless teen. His brother recruits him to take over his driving job for the night. He has sexy Blaire (Debby Ryan) and Zoe (Lucy Fry) as his clients. They are making several stops and intends to finish before sunrise. He has no idea that they are vampires.,/review/rw7466750/?ref_=tt_urv

","Dont get all the 1 and 2 ratings it really wasnt that bad, ok it was no interview with a vampire, but not alot of vampire movies can top that movie.",/review/rw7466750/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2021,Cinema-reviewer321,5," Sucking blood
","First I want to say that I like Vampires, meaning it sucks when Vampires are not portrayed correctly like how badly the Twilight movie series shows them. When they are portrayed right I enjoy the movie more.",/review/rw7466750/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,paul_haakonsen,2," But everything was essentially just pointless...
","Wow, this movie was a swing and a miss. Now, vampire movies are sort of a mixed lot for me, but I opted to watch the 2021 Netflix movie ""Night Teeth"" on the odd chance that it might be an appealing and entertaining one.",/review/rw7466750/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2021,destroyerwod,7," Huge potential not fully achieved, yet fun to watch !
","I was waiting a lot for this movie ever since i saw the first trailer. Its basically some of my favorite things mixed up, like vampires, love story, night of crazy things happening, it had all the ingredient for me to enjoy. Ultimately i did, but not as much as i wish i would have.",/review/rw7466750/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,UniqueParticle,8," I love how one of the top reviewers said Collateral without Tom Cruise but with vampires
","(Debby Ryan) Blaire is worth watching in my opinion I'd love to see her anything else! I'm not fully sure why this is getting a bad rep except some of stale moments even those are very little. The music is excellent, mystery is quite intriguing, cinematography is great and the entertainment value is pretty solid. I'm glad I decided to watch this vampire thrill ride!",/review/rw7466750/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2021,Otte1,3," So much potential....wasted
","This movie could have been an enjoyable horror or horror-comedy similar to The Babysitter. Except, nothing was funny or even remotely cute, there was no horror, most of the action scenes were off-camera and have not seen a protagonist so unlikeable since Tiger King. The main characters over-acted his part of playing stupid and naïve to the point of unwatchable. The plot which could have been simple enough was complicated by a completely unnecessary romance that caused the film to grind to a halt whenever there was dialogue. Also...you never fully know what is going on.",/review/rw7466750/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2021,witra_as,6," Simple bite and easy chew
",Netflix' vampire thriller got simple bite and easy chew for fun movie time. Adam Randall had stylish presentation to make up for sluggish plotholes. Lendeborg Jr. & Ryan were two sympathetic representatives from different world to survive some bloody kills.,/review/rw7466750/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2021,Pairic,7," Good bloodsucking fun
","Night Teeth: An LA (and World) where a secret pact was sealed between humans and vampires 100 years ago, vampires would only take blood by consent. Now a rogue vampire Victor and his minions have broken that pact, slaying humans and the vampire lords. We see nightclubs where humans are strapped to tables, eager to be vampire groupies and give blood, suddenly their throats are torn out by Blaire (Debby Ryan) and Zoe (Lucy Fry). This dastardly duo proceed from club to club slaying the vampire leaders, they have hired Benny (Jorge Lendebourge Jr.) as their chauffeur, thinking he is his brother Jay (Raul Castillo) a human aware of the pact. Benny behaves like his namesake from Crossroads at first but his character develops as the plot unfolds. Vampire enforcers also get involved, clashing with the rogue vampires. Quite gory at times with the biting stabbing and crossbows; Victor literally has human prisoners on tap for blood. Most of the narrative proceeds relatively predictably but there are a few pleasant and disturbing plot turns. Good bloodsucking action and fun. Directed by Adam Randall, written by Brent Dillon. On Netflix. 7/10.",/review/rw7466750/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2021,Saoustou88,1," Here To Save You Precious Time
","Just skip it. They tried with the scenic LA shots, but it's too slow, too long, shockingly horrid acting from everyone involved. Useless plot and storyline. No climax. This is no Interview With A Vampire. It's just disaster end of story.",/review/rw7466750/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2022,guisreis,8," Much better than people are saying
","Although not free of problems, this is an above-average vampire flick and it does not deserve the bad reception it had. Very bright-colored (sometimes seeming too much artificial), it becomes better as it advances. It is true that some problems will continue until the end, such as stupid decisions by the characters just to fit the script (Jay is perhaps the most stupid character among the unintentionally dumb fictional characters I have ever seen), unconvincing blasé reactions to horror, and bad special effects. However, the vamp atmosphere and the mafia-like story are nice. Benny, Zoe, Blaire and Victor are charismatic characters, and there are some visually nice vampires with short appearances too. The film would be better with there were no vampire-hunter.",/review/rw7466750/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2021,Worldstone,8," I hate to admit it, but I loved this movie. This is one of my new favorite vampire movies.
","Had they have made this longer, went more in-depth about the lore , and took out the cringey cgi car scene (facepalm), I think this would have been even better. However, this movie is very solid and I'm happy to put this up there with Underworld/Blade/Dracula Untold/Bram Stoker's Dracula/Dracula(1931).",/review/rw7466750/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2021,kosmasp,8," Take a bite
",Morally speaking you may have some issues with the movie. It does also not warrant for you to overthink the whole concept or certain actions or think things true (like the concept and construct of the world portrayed here). So in other words: do cut this some slack please - for your own sake.,/review/rw7466750/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2021,nogodnomasters,5," Can I drive?
",This is another vampires vs. Humans in LA film. Victor (Alfie Allen) breaks the truth by kidnapping Maria (Ash Santos) Jay's (Raúl Castillo) girlfriend.

28 October 2021,Thanos_Alfie,4," Below average...
","""Night Teeth"" is a Crime - Drama movie in which we watch a chauffeur picks up two mysterious women and soon figures out that they are not common women.

6 April 2022,trashgang,7," entertaining no-brainer
","Out on Flix I watched this being recommanded as a no-brainer flick. I agree, the story is rather simple. Vampire gangs fighting it out against each other.",/review/rw7466750/?ref_=tt_urv

","No style or substance. Main characters a 40 y.o.looking 25 y.o. Carrying a backpack to school, rest of the movie is written just as well. 2 dimensional garbage not worth the time spent watching.",/review/rw7466750/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2021,wisemanfromtowne,3," MTV popcorn
",The agenda of female masculinity is at the tipping point of utter nonsense and these films depicting white chicks only weighing a buck five being invincible has become real tiresome. This spin on vampires taking over is nothing more than MTV popcorn starring GOT Greyjoy and no talent having Megan Fox and her senseless cameo scene.,/review/rw7466750/?ref_=tt_urv
