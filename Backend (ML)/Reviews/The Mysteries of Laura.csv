17 February 2019,Sebastien02,9," A powerful movie
","Based on a true story, this film reminds us that addiction is a disease which does not discriminate: it can hit anybody at any time. Indeed, Nic (Timothée Chalamet) does not fit the stereotype of a junkie: raised in a loving upper-middle-class family, he is a good student and shares a close relationship with his father, David (Steve Carell). However, drugs have been part of his life since the age of 12 (alcohol and marijuana at first). The turning point is when he becomes dependent on methamphetamine, at only 18 years old. From that moment on, Nic and his relatives get trapped in a downward spiral. Despite all the support they give him, they are unable to prevent relapses and fear losing him. This movie accurately describes the harmful effects of drugs on family life. It also explores the limits of parental love. Well directed and earnestly performed, « Beautiful boy » is a deeply human drama.",/review/rw4593302/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2018,mr_bickle_the_pickle,8," Cause it's a long way to go, a hard row to hoe...
","This film is based off the memoir by David Sheff (played by Steve Carell) and Nic Sheff (played by Timothee Chalamet). It follows a father who is desperately trying to help to son and slowly coming to terms that maybe he can't. Let me tell you, this is some powerful stuff that is executed flawlessly by the actors. All were great but in particular Timothee and Steve are standouts. My bet is that the diner scene (""This is who I am"") will be the clip chosen during awards season. But theres also some more subtle nuanced scenes too. In particular there is this scene right after Nic has relapsed by popping some pills and you can just tell he is thinking ""Why did I just do that?"". And your heart also breaks for David when you see him driving around looking for his son.",/review/rw4593302/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2018,ccorral419,9," ""Beautiful Boy"" is a powerful movie going experience
","Belgian Director Felix Van Groningen (""The Broken Circle"" 2012 - Winner of multiple Film Festival Awards) brings the best selling pair of memories, ""Beautiful Boy"" by father David Sheff and ""Tweak"" by son Nic Sheff to the big screen with heart-wrenching perfection. Steve Carell steps into the role of David, a father willing and available to help his son through a period he can't understand. Timothy Chalamet (""Call Me by Your Name"") is Nic, a young boy who appears to have it all, only to be dealing with a dark hole feed by drug addicition. The beauty of this film is that the story is told from both father and son perspectives. Nic writes about what was happening in his head and heart, while David writes what it was like to be a father looking in. Van Groningen's primary setting is a family cabin in the woods of San Francisco. Breathtaking in its appearance, surrounded by the forrest and a yard surely once filled with memorable family times, the interior is mysteriously gloomy and dark, warning the viewer something is wrong here. Cinematography (Ruben Impens), and the films eerie musical score, further cement the tense presented on screen, dropping the viewer into various SF locations that grab you and hold you down. Be for warned: The silence within this film is so powerful, that if you're eating popcorn, sipping on a beverage or your phone rings, you do any of these at your own risk. Yet, however strong this film is, something is missing here. The performance are above terrific and touching, the story is current and relevant, and the mothers (Maura Tierney ""ER"" and Amy Ryan ""Birman"") perspective is equally on point. Yet, I found myself unable to fully latch on to the characters in the manner that I'm sure the writers wanted. ""Beautiful Boy"" is a powerful movie going experience, and one that is hard to get out of your head.",/review/rw4593302/?ref_=tt_urv

24 February 2019,classicsoncall,8," ""When you mourn the living, that's a hard way to live.""
","We all know the devastation caused by the abuse of drugs within families. ""Beautiful Boy"" makes the statement that it can happen to anyone without regard to family status. What's particularly insightful watching the Sheff's deal with son Nic's (Timothée Chalamet) addiction, is that they never lost sight of who they were in relation to each other, and seeing the love that existed between each of the family members even during the darkest periods in Nic's life. I wasn't aware that this story was based on the real life history of David and Nicholas Sheff, drawn from the writings of both some time after Nic eventually became clean and managed to persevere, one day at a time, as drug users are apt to identify. This could have been a formulaic movie, and in some ways it is as it seems to prepare the viewer for the eventual tragedy that many times is the result of hardcore addiction. The most honest message that comes out of the story occurs when David eventually comes to the understanding that there was nothing he could do for his son. Each individual has to come to the realization themselves, that addiction is a one way street and the destination is nowhere. It would be rewarding if a movie like this could make a powerful enough statement for anyone contemplating drug use to just say no, but as Nic's own experience suggests, an underlying sense of alienation and self doubt is often stronger that one's will power.",/review/rw4593302/?ref_=tt_urv

","Steve Carell and Timothee Chalamet are the main reasons to see this film. They bring some otherwise shaky material powerfully to life. Beautiful Boy definitely tries to elicit many emotional responses from its audience, but only succeeds some of the time. It doesn't end up being quite as impactful as I think it intends and it doesn't seem to really end up saying anything about drug addiction.

","I am a heroin and meth addict with 3 years of sobriety. I currently work in a treatment center and I periodically show this movie in my groups, this movie is the best depiction I have ever seen of the life of addiction. It's heartbreaking to watch myself because it parallels my story very closely. The way addiction is shown is so raw and true, the overdoses, the shame, the guilt, the question of why that can never be answered. It's beautiful and heart wrenching, it's honestly not easy to watch but it is accurate (too a point, addicts know a few things that are a little wrong but that's small specifics) and the acting is phenomenal.",/review/rw4593302/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2018,ss0187,10," Candid, compelling, cathartic cinema
","The best movie I have seen so far in 2018. It is heart-wrenching, compelling, emotionally raw, and authentic. The acting from Timothee Chalamet and Steve Carell is strong and Oscar-worthy. Timothee is proving to be one of the best actors of his generation. It is a no-frills movie that illustrates the struggles and cyclical nature of destructive addiction, relapse, and recovery. It is beautifully directed and poignantly adapted from two memoirs. It also displays the emotional dynamic and turmoil of the father-son bond wonderfully. The cinematography is also top notch and captures the tone of the film. I am honestly baffled by some of the critic reviews. Beautiful Boy deserves a much higher rating. The film is honest and I empathized with the issues because the film explores the pain in such a real way. We witness how the addiction affects the entire family and how average people can be sucked into the black hole that drugs offers. It is relevant in this day and age to show the problems that relatable youth face. In most Hollywood films, we typically see the addiction melodramatically explored with individuals suffering from a specific trauma or living in abject poverty. In this film, we see the torment & despair of addiction powerfully & realistically explored within a middle-class family. Beautiful Boy is a must-see for everyone. It deserves Oscar nominations for Timothee Chalamet, adapted screenplay, cinematography, and directing. The entire cast is exceptional and should receive a SAG ensemble nomination. The movie is so much better than a number of the other acclaimed, flashy Oscar contenders of 2018. Beautiful Boy is candid and naturalistic. Not only does the audience get access to such fine artful filmmaking but also gets served with life lessons. There are a number of tear-jerking scenes and the pathos of it all, hit the core of my soul.",/review/rw4593302/?ref_=tt_urv

30 October 2018,ThomasDrufke,7," The Road to Recovery
","Movies about addiction are typically incredibly difficult to watch, my mind always drifts to movies like Rachel Getting Married or in an extreme sense, Requiem for a Dream. Just brutal movies to get through, and Beautiful Boy seemed poised to take the next slot in that group of films. While it's not exactly as powerful as either of those films, it features to stellar performances, and one that should get Timothee Chalamet his second consecutive nod for best actor, unless of course they put him in as supporting. But it's his turn as a young adult addicted to Meth, among many many other drugs. And as I just said about 'Mid90s', this film (likely because it's directly based on two memoirs) feels entirely authentic. Something that can't always be said about Oscar bait movies like this one. And while at times the film feels jumbled and uneven, those performances are what keep you invested. Make no mistake, they are Oscar worthy material.",/review/rw4593302/?ref_=tt_urv

",Firstly Carrell and Chalamet were both excellent performance wise but the finished product just felt like it missed the mark a little. At some times it felt like it wasn't hard hitting enough and rather fluffy in parts whilst also seemingly heavily waited towards the fathers viewpoint rather than the sons in comparison to the source material. The last 15-20minutes especially missed the mark for me. Overall though it was still a captivating watch thanks to the two leads but it would be better with a greater viewpoint from both sides than predominantly the one and a lot more powerful also.,/review/rw4593302/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2018,garyvanb,9," Bluntly Sad Study of the Hopelessness of Drug Addiction
","As my sister said, very well done film. It's about the true story of a writer and father who begins losing his straight A son with a bright future to drugs. Pot is only the beginning, and Crystal Meth is nearly the end. The film does a great job dealing with the psychology of drug addiction and how it affects those addicted AND their loved ones. Steve Carrell tries everything, including love and reason, and sometimes it works, but not for long, and sometimes it doesn't. In the end - SPOILER ALERT - he and his family realize there is really NOTHING they can do, because love and reason only works for a time, and the drug addict often only uses them to continue doing drugs. Eventually, Carrell must cut his son off and wish him the best. Needless to say, it's a sad movie, with a feeling of dread and hopelessness at it's center to thoroughly capture the essence of a drug addict on a downward spiral. For a loving and caring father to see his beautiful boy become something he never expected and doesn't understand and can't help is tragic. It was a very well done movie, very thought provoking, and any parent of a drug addict would only be helped by seeing it because it does show the reality of the addiction, and that you can't save them by your actions, that it is eventually up to them to make the choice to continue using or stop. And it's a DAILY choice. At one point, he's clean for over a year. Then one night, the addiction hits again, he succombs, drops out of sight, and becomes even worse than he was before. Then he breaks in to his Dad's house to steal money, his girlfriend nearly OD's, and then nearly OD's himself shortly after in a bathroom stall, and Carrell is helpless to stop it because if he tries to intercede, it will just prolong the inevitable. Just sad, and perhaps too sad to give this movie it's deserved A, because it's actually grueling to sit through. There's no denying the script and acting are all first rate, and at least it makes you feel something about real life, and educates you about the psychology of drugs and addiction. It's the kind of movie I do recommend people see, as long as they're prepared going in. In many ways, it has many parrallels to The Exorcist. Both movies are about parents who are helpless as they watch their teenage children enter a downward, deathly spiral.",/review/rw4593302/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2018,EderR28,8," A decent film with fantastic actors
","Disclaimer: the film, in isolation, is probably more worthy of 6 stars, BUT Timothée Chalamet and Steve Carrell are too fricken talented for me to ignore. They absolutely blew my mind. While I have never battled addiction or really know anyone who has, I can confidently say that Timothée's portrayal as an addict and Steve's as a grieving parent was so authentic and heartbreaking. The rest of the cast was great and helped elevate the film even further, too. Some of the editing was weird and confused me a bit, especially the flashbacks. But it didn't impede the impact of the film. Like I said, even without this cast of actors it would've been an admirable film nonetheless, but because of their performances it took a decent film and made it very good one. #TimothéeOscars2019",/review/rw4593302/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2019,Horst_In_Translation,6," (Much more than) A strong father-son movie
","""Beautiful Boy"" is a new American movie from 2018 directed by Belgian filmmaker Felix van Groeningen and he is also a writer here. Will this film surpass the popularity of the Oscar-nominated ""The Broken Circle Breakdown""? We shall see. Time will tell. Going back to writing, this film is based on two books actually, one of them wearing the same title like the film and written by the father in the film and secondly a book written by the son from the movie. Which shows you that the son will live in the end. Which is in fact a bit of a huge spoiler because eventually you see the son inside the toilet room at the ground and you think he is ODing. Okay, but no more spoilers now. One of the strengths here is certainly the acting. This refers to basically everybody involved, but most of all Carell, who once again proves he can also cope well with very serious material (like his Oscar nom), Chalamet and also in a smaller role Maura Tierney from ""The Affair"". Chalamet by the way scored a great deal of awards recognition like a Golden Globe nomination and an SAG Award nomination, but he did come short at the Oscars and did not manage a second nomination in a row. A bit surprising. But honestly not completely wrong. He isn't bad, but best-of-the-year worthy I don't know. I think a lot of the appreciation he received here also has to do with the makeup showing him suffering and wasted from the years of drug abuse behind him. Certainly a very baity role for him. And again, the approach to his characters being liked by the girls, being smart, highly intelligent in fact and enjoying the sweet sides of life is one we saw from him next to Armie Hammer too, so there are some parallels.",/review/rw4593302/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," Overstays its welcome.
","Because of the nature of its story, 'Beautiful Boy (2018)' is repetitive. It tries its best to replicate the vicious recovery-relapse cycle that most addicts go through, and initially succeeds in doing so, but it ends up overstaying its welcome by quite a long while, marching past its presumed end to noble yet detrimental effect. On the whole, the film feels very long, especially after it exceeds this natural end-point. Plus, its actual ending is at odds with the near novel-length 'text ending'. I feel as though a few of the relapse periods, especially early on, should have perhaps been truncated - or, even, totally removed; this way, the piece would maintain its purposefully non-conventional, almost frustrating structure without (as much of) its repetitive pacing. The structure itself is a little strange because the picture plays around with time in some counter-intuitive and, frankly, unnecessary ways. Occasionally, these time-jumps are confusing, if not jarring, and they only serve to further distance us from the plot's events. Another issue with the picture is its soundtrack, which is often played distractingly loud and feels as though it's being used as the sole emotional manipulator. The soundscape usually goes for this annoying faux-'punk' feel meant to embody a disenfranchised youth, but this seems incredibly on-the-nose and the actual song choices are sometimes strange, as well as obvious (if you'll forgive the juxtaposition). The fact that the music is meant to elicit emotion more than the scenes themselves - or, at least, it overpowers the scenes themselves - is a bit of an issue, especially since the flick didn't affect me at all, despite its 'heart-wrenching' narrative. Indeed, aside from its function as a realistic, anti-drug biopic, it functions mainly as a tear-jerker, so it is a bit of a problem that not a single one of my tears were ever close to being jerked (and it's not like I have a heart of stone, either). You engage with the experience more with your head than your heart. It all feels rather distant, to be honest. The piece's major saving grace is its lead performances. Both Carell and Chalamet really are great. They believably portray the relatively compelling father-son dynamic at the heart of the story, differing greatly while also having many similarities (aspects of their relationship which aren't highlighted as much as I'd perhaps have liked). The other players are all good, too, and compound the flick's events as occurring in the 'real world'. The performances and this grounded vibe keep things more than watchable, even if the overall result is slightly underwhelming. This isn't a bad effort, just a somewhat hollow one. 6/10",/review/rw4593302/?ref_=tt_urv
