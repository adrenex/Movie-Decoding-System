15 July 2022,sumtim3s00n,5," Milking the name
","The animation seem somehow bleak and cheap, trying to make the scenes as curtailed and limited, no detailed background teaming with life and color. The now supposedly master has reverted a few steps back into buffonery with jokes that will not make anyone but a small child smile. In general one feels like watching once favourite characters do their thing again and jump up and down the screen but in quickly put together , subaverage plot with recycled jokes so that kids can maybe smile at seeing them again and ask their parents to watch it again. Thats it at best, for kids and the cut off age low.",/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2022,gamergunk42,5," Average, but promises more
","I read other reviews, and while I do think some points are exaggerated in their quality, I understand where people are coming from. Dreamworks had hyped up Jack Black being on the project a lot, portraying this show as an unofficial Kung Fu Panda 4, when in reality this was just another generic kids show based on a Dreamworks property.",/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2022,vluckylkv,3," Really tested my patience
",Story progresses so slow that if you miss several of the middle episodes still it will create no impact on the storyline. PO is so strong in movies and here he's shown very weak and immature. Kids will definitely love it but as a kung fu panda trilogy fan I didn't liked it at all.,/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2022,kariverson,1," Character Assassination
","Another Franchise fallen. Empty (where are the pandas), soulless character assassination of Po the Dragon Master. An Incompetent, useless, stupid Dragon Master Po that seems to have come from before the first movie.",/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2022,lovemichaeljordan,6," Does a perfect trilogy need a spin-off?
",Po is undeniably an audience favorite and a spin-off series with Po voiced by the legendary Jack Black sounds like a good idea. But is it? The animation is poor with a few good-looking frame. You get used to it after a while and it's definetly watchable. Kids will like it.,/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2022,jeremycrimsonfox,2," Was This Series Really Necessary?
","After a failed attempt to stop a gang of weasels from stealing the WuGao Gauntlet goes bad, Po's reputation is destroyed and he is stripped of his status as Dragon Master. Now he must go on a quest to recover the gauntlet and restore his reputation, gaining help from a new character named Luthera, a female bear who is a knight from the land of.

24 July 2022,Metern-Chaao19,3," Worst Kung Fu Panda production
","This series is terrible. The way it's told is so bad i could not enjoy watching it
And the animation extremely cheap and look awful.",/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2022,only-kader,1," Sound very cheap scripting!
",Script was very disappointing. Watched the season with a lot of expectation that did not meet at all. Too much stupidity shown in the characters. Unnecessary scenes and dialogues. Do not spoil the dragon warrior's fame please.,/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2022,eladamittai,5," Honestly, very disappointment

17 July 2022,riverraft,1," Throwing Character development in the Garbage
","I have been watching this franchise since I was kid and I admired Po's tenacity, inner strength and the love he held in his heart. All the characters went through development and at the end none of them were as they used to be at start. Even the Antagonists were realistic and relatable.",/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2022,rjmthomas,4," Just about got through it but ...
","I felt this was a major step back from the original films. Jack Black is great as ever but the rest of the cast just take this to a different level, in a bad way ... the original films had some seriousness to them with a great cast and were easy and very fun to watch as an adult. This feels like it should be on CBeebies with some of the voice acting and animations, as it seems more tailored for children rather than the audience that enjoyed the original films.",/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2022,blades-8,1," Ouch
","The trilogy is so masterfully crafted in story and progression, you could just teach someone their 3 principles (imho, 1-be humble and follow your passion, 2-find your inner peace, 3-embrace who you really are) and you can create quite the human being.",/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2022,willz187,4," In the middle
","Liking this much more than the series Awesomeness. Not up there with the movies. So, in the middle. Points off for often seeing some shotty animation. Story is good not great. Lots of things to love like the character designs! Overall a nice gift on this hot summer day.",/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2022,shrikantb-04822,3," Disappointed By Writer
","When we are start watching the series we imagine the Kung Fu Panda Action and Comedy sence But This Series are not giving that level Action and Comedy
Panda nature are free style comedy - perfect in battle and Always in Top level
But this series are not showing that kind of Entertainment.",/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2022,thismayverywellbea,7," Decent worth watching
","Show progresses slowly. Animation is good for a DreamWorks TV show and voices original actors such as Jack black. Story is similar to Avengers: Infinity War. Po was tasked to get the Gaunlet but two bad guys attempt to steal it first. Their plans backfire but Po accidently let them get away with the town surrounding the gaunlet being destroyed, leaving people injured. Po is then not loved anymore and no one is his fan anymore. The emperor of China even revokes Po's title of Dragon Master. Po meets an English Knight who is tasked to retrieve the gaunlet to save England. Po sees this as an opportunity to team up with the knight to save the gaundlet in order to reclaim his title for Dragon master and to be loved again. The story is too simple however and feels as if it drags on. The episode feels like it could be 11 minutes instead of 22. Plot is good but the pacing of the plot is too slow. Acting is good animation is good directing is good. For some reason Po is seen as gullible and dull here but in the movies he was stronger and had developed to be a true master. I wonder why he had been downgraded in this show. The movies had already been a great ending for the franchise as Po had fully developed and became a perfect person. Otherwise, it is worth watching. 7/10.",/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2022,lotifurshabbir,1," Totally Disappointing
","This was the worst among all the Kung Fu Panda. If u want to kill your time please watch it. Otherwise, watch a review on YouTube that will be enough.",/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2022,paradoxhell,1," Time spent for a rubbish ending!
","If the producers read this, you should just cancel the series. It's the worst script and characters in the history of 3D animations. The utterly garbage Veruca and Klaus acting, and voice, plus the laughing... I barely made it to the end to see it done, and yet, you made the stupidest ending. Why would you mock a 10* series with this rubbish? This is the future of filmography? Really?",/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2022,hasanzig,3," ""Dragon Master"" is so weak
",In the last film we know this panda is very strong. But here he is even weaker than he was in the first film.,/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2022,fenialagiou,10," Fun and funny.
","Great sense of humor as always. Well written story and the kids will love it. I actually liked it very much. It's not a ""10"" of course but I hated so much the fact that people were so harsh with it for no reason so I raised my markl. I 've watched all the episodes in a day and had a really nice time.",/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2022,marksspricis,6," Good story, bad animation
","Kung Fu Panda: the dragon knight is the newest Kung Fu Panda tv show, it tells the story of Po going on a journey with a British knight Luthera. The animation is absolutely awful probably the fault of the small budget which is a shame because I think the storyline in the show is pretty good and it is interesting to see how everything is connected and jokes are pretty funny - the same humour as in the movies. I don't know if I wanted more Po but this wasn't bad as animation quality would make it seam. All in all Kung Fu Panda: the dragon knight is very unnecessary cartoon and it would probably work better as a movie but this show is fairly watchable especially if you're a fan of Kung Fu Panda franchise.",/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv

","Tired of seeing a dragon master as weak and helpless
We want him as a proper teacher not a cry baby
Give him cool chi powers of oogway
Story is good except weak po but too long
Poor animstions 2008 movie is better
No budget for fight choreography?",/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv

",If you take this seriously you will not enjoy it - a good laugh with a fun action packed story line and some silly humor. Looking forward to season 2!,/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2022,cspadafino,10," Finally something that gave back my childhood!!
",For everyone that's shtting on this show because of the artstyle. Just appreciate the show for real. I mean I get the frustration but I was happy that there was a new chapter in the Kunf Fu Panda saga so I started watching the show with mixed feelings. I get the hate on buget artstyle but still I gave it a fair chance. As happy as I was that they dropt new Kung Fu Panda content. As happy I was after I wachted everything. Say what you want but this show has a great old school Kung Fu Panda vibe with excellent deepness and story building. I watch a lot of shows and never leave feedback but this show needs way more love then it gets. Please give us a Season 2 !!,/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2022,bayezid-92481,2," Po too much simp!
",Po is totally addicted to blade. All episodes are filled with po's simping. It totally annoying thing. A pure cartoon lover don't want this and this is not perfect to children. We miss old Kung Fu Panda.,/review/rw8366965/?ref_=tt_urv
