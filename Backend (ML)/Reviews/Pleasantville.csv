26 April 2005,philip_vanderveken,8," Maybe not the most original movie, but a very good one in the genre of the heist / action flicks
","A few years ago I saw this remake of the sixties classic with the Mini Coopers for the first time and I remember liking it a lot. Now, about two years later it was shown on television and I just wanted to know whether I would still like it as much as when I saw it in the cinema. Well, the answer is yes.",/review/rw0872202/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2005,Barky44,8," Great, fun, caper flick
","The Italian Job is a real blast to watch. It's a genuinely entertaining film, something you watch just for the sheer enjoyment of it. It's not heavy with drama or emotional hand-wringing, it has no cosmic statements about life, and it's not violent or profane. It's just a fun movie. Between watching the little Mini Coopers fly around the crowded streets of L.A. and the great bits by stereotypical computer geek-turned-crook (played gleefully by Seth Greene), I had a lot of fun watching this film.",/review/rw0872202/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2005,lemon_magic,7," Slick, amusing caper film; Gray's best movie featuring Davis' best soundtrack
","My reaction to this remake of ""The Italian Job"" is probably hopelessly mixed up with the events occurring in my life when I saw it; This is the first movie I saw after I had just landed a job after 8 months of unemployment and going back to school for retraining. Money was still tight, but I no longer had to choose between seeing a movie in the theaters and paying bills (or eating lunch), and the sense of relief and gratitude I was feeling at the time was enormous. In consequence, my enjoyment of ""Italian Job"" was probably far out of proportion to its actual worth. ",/review/rw0872202/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2003,iwatcheverything,7," Highly entertaining
",If you are looking for a film that is quick witted and won't bore you then this is the place.  It is fast paced and funny with some decent acting comeing from the characters.  It is always hard for me to see Mark Walhberg as anything except Marky Mark.  That image is burned in my mind forever.  As an actor though he is pretty good.  This movie is a must see for action fans who like to see a few little twists and turns.  I will have to pick this movie up one day and buy it.,/review/rw0872202/?ref_=tt_urv

","Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) assembles a crack team to pull off one last job; a daring heist of a safe which contains $35 million dollars worth of gold bars. However, shortly after the heist has been completed, one of the team turns against the others and escapes with the gold and leaves the remaining members of the team for dead. Following this betrayal, Charlie and his crack team which includes computer genius Lyle (Seth Green), explosives expert Left Ear (Mos Def), and getaway driver Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) set to work in recovering the gold back from the 'rat' in the group with the assistance of safe cracker Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron).",/review/rw0872202/?ref_=tt_urv

","I went to see THE ITALIAN JOB with mixed reviews in my head.  I was pleasantly surprised with an entertaining close to 2 hours.

7 October 2003,=G=,5," Junk food for the tween mind
","""The Italian Job"" (2003), a commercial product after the tween/teen buck, is an uninspired action flick with a very soft PG-13 rating and a simple-minded make-it-up-as-you-go plot about a bunch of thieves (the good guys) who are after 7 tons of gold and another thief (the bad guy). A mindless mess of Hollywood action busyness, this flick might have been worth watching if any of the stunts or chases or techno-babble had been new, creative, or unique. However, this turkey is just more of the same-o same-o we've all seen before sprinkled with some contempo buzz words in a new wrapper. No matter how you slice it, this time-waster is just more cinematic junk food and market clutter. (C)",/review/rw0872202/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2007,extravaluejotter,1," No Sauce, just Plain Boiled Pasta
","This is a woeful Hollywood remake of a classic British film. Everything that made the original ""Italian Job"" entertaining has been bled out of this festering sore of a movie ""scripted"" by Donna and Wayne Powers and listlessly ""directed"" by F Gary Gray. I am amazed that Troy Kennedy Martin (the screenwriter of the original film) allowed his name to be used in the credits for this pig's ear. Martin has worked on some of the finest film and TV projects of the last 40-odd years. Even being vaguely associated with this stinker is NOT A GOOD THING.",/review/rw0872202/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2013,SnoopyStyle,7," fun chase heist movie
","John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) and team successfully steal $35 million in gold in Venice, Italy. They get double-crossed by team member Steve (Edward Norton) and John is killed. After finding Steve in L.A., Charlie reassembles the team to rob Steve and get revenge. However, he needs the help of John Bridger's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron), a professional safe cracker who uses her skills for good. This also stars Seth Green, Mos Def, and Jason Statham as members of the team. That's a great group of actors, and they had a fun time driving Mini Coopers thru L.A. traffic and under L.A. And I think we all had fun.",/review/rw0872202/?ref_=tt_urv

","Those are just a few to grace this cast. I don't know what it is about heist film always having all-star casts but gotta love it. On to the movie, its about a group of thieves who steal $35 million in gold only to have a member of their crew (Norton) double-cross them to take the gold for himself and leave the crew for dead. Well don't you know it the crew survives (minus one) and want payback. Thus introduce car chases, neat gizmos, cool cars, and lots of humour, while attempting to be serious.",/review/rw0872202/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2010,TheLittleSongbird,7," Enjoyable, if inferior to the 1969 film...
","The 1969 film I don't revere as a classic but it was very entertaining, and I have to say this film is just as enjoyable. While inferior in some aspects I actually noticed one or two improvements. The plot does meander slightly in the second half, and I found Edward Norton's villain too sleazy and one-dimensional. The film is also a tad too long by about two or three minutes. But it is very fast paced, looks great, has a great soundtrack and has some wonderful set pieces, very like the 1969 film. Where the improvements come are in the direction and the script, here the direction is super-charged, in the 1969 film I found it too flashy, and the script was smarter and more consistent. And the acting wasn't bad either. Mark Wahlberg takes on the Michael Caine role with real enthusiasm and charm and Seth Green is very funny in a very different role. Not to mention Charlize Theron, who is very beguiling as the sassy safe cracker. Overall, entertaining and enjoyable. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw0872202/?ref_=tt_urv

22 July 2019,nebula-37029,3," Little to do with Italy or Logic
","This movie is not to be confused with the 1969 Michael Caine film, which was about an heist in Italy. This movie does not take place in Italy, but provides a weak excuse for the title. Although Ms. Theron is lovely, the movie has little else going for it. At times it appears to be a long mini-Cooper commercial. We are also expected to cheer for a bunch of people who, while stealing money, deliberately cause the taxpayers millions in infrastructure damage to cover their tracks.",/review/rw0872202/?ref_=tt_urv

5 June 2003,ferguson-6,7," Forget the Coopers, I want a Charlize
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Today's giant movie screens and earth rumbling sound systems make action films an exhilarating experience.  Throw in a nice story and some eye candy and it is truly a blast.  OK the story is just a reshaping of the original with Michael Caine, but the added humor - mostly supplied by Seth Green (""Austin Powers"" and ""Knockaround Guys"") and the super cool guys - Jason Statham, Marky Mark and veteran Donald Sutherland add a punch to this one.  Who am I kidding?  The big difference here is the eye candy!  The mini-Coopers and Charlize Theron add a touch of Bond.  Whether the stunner is driving the fun cars or cracking a safe in her hotel room, she is captivating.  The films weak link is the usually dependable Edward Norton who seems to be sleep walking through his role. Maybe he has reached the point where he feels he deserves more screen time. His role is important, but his lackluster performance doesn't ruin the film at all.  Would have enjoyed seeing what a meatier performance could have added to the film, though.  Anyway, enjoy the ride and the view!",/review/rw0872202/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2015,anaconda-40658,4," Not As Good a Job as What Michael Caine Delivered.
","The Italian Job (2003): Dir: F. Gary Grey / Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Jason Statham, Donald Sutherland: The title doesn't describe the film as a whole but it is a remake of a much better film. The characters had potential but none have personalities. They are double crossed after a heist. Those remaining narrowly avoid death and plot revenge a year later with plans to steal the gold bars they originally stole. Setup isn't new but structure details the operation. The conclusion more or less glorifies crime. Director F. Gary Grey previously made the cliché filled farce The Negotiator. Mark Wahlberg is no Michael Caine but he does pull off the desire for revenge after a hefty double cross. After devising the plan he is assisted by Charlize Theron who plays the daughter of his deceased boss who was murdered during the opening sabotage. Both are driven by revenge, which serves against any sympathy in the end. Edward Norton plays a double crossing sleaze who learns that his intelligence is outmatched. Other roles are not as broad although Jason Statham is featured among the supporting cast. Donald Sutherland plays their former boss and Theron's father but the role isn't very broad. It substitutes the original's humour for action with little purpose. The result is an action film that doesn't represent Italy let alone get the job done.

27 July 2004,MLDinTN,," not inventive enough
","In the past couple of years, I've seen much better heist films, like Ocean's 11, the Heist, and the Score.  Those were much better and had better double crossing plots.  This movie was rather boring with the best part being the robbery of the gold and the neat idea of getting it out underwater.  Also, the scene where Charlie slugs Steve at the table was good.  But, I didn't think much of the Mini-Cooper chase. It wasn't that great or original.  And there wasn't that twist at the end where someone you thought was good or bad is exactly the opposite.",/review/rw0872202/?ref_=tt_urv
