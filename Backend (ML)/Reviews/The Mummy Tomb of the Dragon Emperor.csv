18 September 2013,AaronCapenBanner,7," Part II.
","Steven Spielberg returned to direct this sequel,(loosely) based on the Michael Crichton novel that sees Jeff Goldblum returning as Dr. Ian Malcolm, who is enlisted by John Hammond(Richard Attenborough again) to return to Jurassic Park(though on previously unmentioned Site B) to study the dinosaur population, and also to rescue another team, which includes a former flame of his(played by Julianne Moore). He reluctantly agrees, and after locating her, finds to their disgust that the company INGEN has allowed hunting parties to take place, where big-game hunters(led by Pete Postlethwaite) stalk and kill dinosaurs, though the tables would of course be turned...",/review/rw0424127/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2015,classicsoncall,7," ""Yeah. Ooh-ah, that's how it always starts.""
","I guess I'll have to put this one under my guilty pleasures department. I've always been a sucker for dinosaurs, and with the filming technology available today, a film like this one and it's predecessor have just the right ingredients for a fun time. Granted, there are many elements in the story here that don't make a whole lot of sense, but there's that old saying about suspending disbelief, so that's what I'm applying here.",/review/rw0424127/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2013,SanteeFats,8," Very good
","Not quite as good as the first one only because several of the first movie cast was not in it. Sam Neill, Laura Dern are two that come to mind. This is still an excellent movie. Jeff Golblum is back as Doctor Ian Malcolm and does his usual good job. His character is still insightful and more importantly he still gets some humorous lines as well. Julianne Moore plays a very tunnel vision doctor that is more interested in the animals than in her own survival, at least at times. One of the not so good guys that are also on this island if the hunter played by Pete Postlethwaite. He is there for the protection but his personal objective is to bag a big one. Well it turns out he gets bagged.",/review/rw0424127/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2015,ivo-cobra8,9," Defending an Underrated Sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park
","I still don't get the hate for The Lost World: Jurassic Park and the love for Jurassic Park III? Can Someone explain to me why is III in your opinion so much better than The Lost World: Jurassic Park is? In my opinion III lacks on the story and is not terrible because Steven Spielberg did not Direct the movie but it is terrible because the whole movie makes no damn sense it is too short, it lacks on the story and is really awful to me. It has no character development in III at all and lying to Dr. Grant and trick him on that island is just inhuman and awful. And Why is Jurassic World so much better than The Lost World: Jurassic Park? I am sorry is not better than the second movie. In my opinion is not, but is at least better than Jurassic Lark III is but is not any better over The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997).",/review/rw0424127/?ref_=tt_urv

30 September 2010,gigan-92,8," Here Come the Money Shots!!
","Here comes the sequel to an epic. Steven Spielberg is back and what we get is a mixed bag. I saw it as a kid and naturally loved it. But as we grow older, so do our knowledge and need for probing. Some cast members did not return and weren't even referenced to at all in the story but other aspects in this film make up for it. Jeff Goldblum does reprise his role and I'm quite happy about that. Julian Moore and Vince Vaughn star here, but to me the actor who really caught my eye was Pete Postlethwaite, as Roland. In terms of story this film was definitely built as a thriller. A lot of the story is non-sensible, as I'm sure you've read. The boat somehow guiding itself back to the exact spot where it was destined via no pilot (or maybe auto-pilot), an experienced mercenary on an island full of flesh-eating dinosaurs wandering off just to take a leak, with Juan listening to his MP3 trying to catch a baby dinosaur when I'm sure you heard its enraged father is right behind himeh, the list goes on give or take. Basically this purely a money-shot type of film. We do see a bit of a deeper side to Goldblum's character and that does add a bit of zest to it all. A lot of the other characters are mildly gone into, just barely enough to get a sense of who they are. But suckers like me to this day end up caring for them. Ha-ha Decent characterization at best.",/review/rw0424127/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2015,KineticSeoul,8," A solid sequel to a classic
","This is a solid follow up to a classic dinosaur crisis movie. I remember watching this movie at the theater as a kid and enjoying the heck out of it. As a kid I just really found this film to be mesmerizing, exciting and entertaining. Watching it now I still found it to be a enthralling and fun movie to watch. The plot is coherent and the sense of action and excitement with the story is put together very well. There is a lot of good ideas and settings when it comes to the dinosaurs and human interactions and action sequences. It all melds together in the good old fashion Spielberg style. To the point it was thrilling from beginning to end. Most of the characters was coherent with the story and it was nice to see Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) as the main lead this time around, since he was a likable character in the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie. Although the actress that played Ian's daughter was pretty bad when it comes to the acting department, at least in this film. Overall this movie is most definitely a worthwhile watch and it's one of those films I don't get why some reviewers bash on it.",/review/rw0424127/?ref_=tt_urv

29 August 2015,jaredpahl,9," Supremely Thrilling, Suspenseful, and Visually Breathtaking, The Lost World is a Summer Blockbuster Sequel Done Right
","The Lost World: Jurassic Park, the sequel to Steven Spielberg's iconic blockbuster, was released to massive commercial success, but critical disappointment. While audiences flocked to see the follow-up to the highest grossing movie of all-time, critics lambasted the movie for failing to live up to the high mark set by its groundbreaking predecessor. I'm here to set the record straight. The critics were demonstrably wrong. The Lost World is one of the most underrated, and over-hated movies of recent memory. Four years after Jurassic Park captivated audiences around the world, Steven Spielberg returned to the director's chair to craft a sequel that matched the original in every area that mattered. The Lost World is as technically accomplished, as thrilling, and as exquisitely crafted as the highly praised, Jurassic Park. Critics be damned!",/review/rw0424127/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2015,StevePulaski,8," A moodier take on an instant classic
","Despite having perhaps one of the worst sequel titles in film history, The Lost World: Jurassic Park winds up being a favorable dinosaur outing. One of the pleasant things about the Jurassic Park franchise is that dinosaur films are few and far between, which allows for the ideas and sequences in these films to remain mostly fresh. There's little interference with ""been there, done that"" responses to action setpieces, nor is there a general cynicism to the tones of these films or the imagery (which gets especially moodier in this film). The wonder and elements of peril are still firmly instilled in Spielberg's direction and David Koepp's screenplay, making for a film that continues to really emphasize the thrill of its predecessor through nearly every scene.",/review/rw0424127/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2015,taylorkingston,7," A good follow-up
","I really enjoy this movie. It's not as good as the first movie, but it is hard to top Jurassic Park. And not many sequels surpass their predecessors anyway. It's good time for everyone.",/review/rw0424127/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2015,luke-a-mcgowan,8," The Lost World boasts simply incredible visuals, a lovable cast, a novel idea and a lingering sense of ominous dread. I could never have asked for more in a sequel.
","Where do you go when you've created one of the best popcorn thriller films of all time? Many of the haters of The Lost World wouldn't be able to answer that question. Meanwhile, I believe that Spielberg and Koepp found the right way to go about it, and created an delightfully ominous sequel with enough substance that it can proudly stand beside the original.",/review/rw0424127/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2015,Terryfan,8," Jurassic Park returns

11 March 2017,zkonedog,4," Jurassic Park II: The Lost Plot
","The first Jurassic Park film worked because it focused on the morality of the entire situation, with the dinosaurs playing a supporting role (though quite a large one, considering the incredible visual effects). Unfortunately, the sequel does not hold true to this formula, and instead has idiotic characters doing inane tasks, all the while showcasing the roaring dinos and, in the end, turning into little more than Godzilla.",/review/rw0424127/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2021,joiningjt,8," Decent sequel, not amazing but a worthy sequel to a MASTERPIECE!!!
","This is a homage to a lot of older movies I definitely see some homage to movies king Kong, godzilla, and the 1st jurassic park. Spielberg is a creative genius and it shows in all his movies. Passion is a must for all artists and that's what director's are Underrated artists!! I'm not into traditional art, ie. Painting, sculptures , etc. My form of art that I'm passionate about is the film industry. Nothing better emotionally and visually than a great film. This film had the hardest thing to do, follow a masterpiece which is what the 1st movie was. It's almost impossible to do but I think they did here, though not as good as the original but a very worthy sequel. Most people dont like part 3 but I loved it!!! Then the next 2 are decent but Visually stunning in their phenomenal 3d display!!!!!",/review/rw0424127/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2003,departed07,10," Another Steven Spielberg Classic Comes To Life
","It has been four years since Jurassic Park was destroyed and the island Isla Nublar itself was drowned by a hurricane killing most of the dinosaurs; now there is a new island (called Isla Sorna) that has been genetically engineering the same animals, but abandoned the project after the company InGen declared bankruptcy.",/review/rw0424127/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2008,brando647,8," A Worthy Sequel to One of My Favorite Movies
","Steven Spielberg returns with a sequel to his 1993 blockbuster that I believe was under-rated by many people. I loved the film when I first saw it in theaters in 1997 and, while it didn't seem as impressive on second viewing, I still find it to be one of the best sequels I've seen. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough returns for this short cameo) has discovered that some of the dinosaurs originally intended for his park have been surviving on the secondary island, Isla Sorna. Isla Sorna housed the location of Site B, where most of the dinosaurs would be hatched before bringing them over to Isla Nublar and Jurassic Park. Hammond is determined to send a team, led by a more than reluctant Ian Malcolm, to the island to retrieve photographic documentation of the thriving dinosaurs in an effort to gain public support in preserving the location.",/review/rw0424127/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2002,Jack the Ripper1888,9," Not Speilberg's most ingenious work, but not that bad.
","The original JURASSIC PARK was a classic action adventure. So, now, four years after the success of the first film, we are given THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK. Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough being the only two who return from the original and also a truckload of new characters. Julianne Moore, Pete Postlethaite, Vince Vaughn, Vanessa Lee Chester, Arliss Howard, Thomas F. Duffy, Peter Storemare, Richard Schiff, and Thomas Rosales co-star in a film that tries to rip off the success of its predecessor.",/review/rw0424127/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2003,emfern13,9," Changed my opinion
","I have changed my mind this is not the best movie of 1997, not even close. I really enjoyed this movie alot though. The Special Effects were great and the action scenes were very well done. The Ending is probably the lowpoint but I dont hate it. I think its just as Good as the first one but both of them have their flaws.",/review/rw0424127/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2007,TheUnknown837-1,7," a worthy sequel with excellent visuals, but a somewhat underdeveloped storyline
","The first film, ""Jurassic Park"" was an enormous commercial, and fairly good critical success worldwide. And it is of no surprise to cinema-goers such as myself that a sequel would be released sooner or later, whether or not original novel author Michael Crichton wrote it in paper form first. I myself have read Crichton's novel, upon which this film was based. And I have, of course, seen the film numerous times. When I was young, this was my favorite out all three films because it had the most dinosaurs and elaborate sequences in it. Now I consider it second-best. And I do have to criticize it for a few flaws, which unfortunately, for it, are very important in a good film. However, ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" does pull itself off as a fairly good film for what it was meant to be: an elaborate and heart-pounding action thriller. And it does just that.",/review/rw0424127/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2006,eternalsea,7," Very good sequel
","The Lost World is the sequel to the 1993 classic Jurassic Park. Whilst this film is not as good as the original it does stand up well as a sequel. Jeff Goldblum returns as Ian Malcolm. Malcolm has been asked to return to another Island were Dinosaurs have been allowed to live without cages. Malcolm refuses but when he finds out his paleontolagist girlfriend is already there he goes with a team of documentariens to rescue her. However several accidents ensue and they are left stranded on the Island with a second party. The film does not have the all round strength of the first and is far more dependant on thrills and its visual effects this time round. It does however succeed as good entertainment and its better than the third installment in the franchise by quite a bit. The Dino sequences are handled well with the Raptors in the long grass being the highlight of those and quite possibly the entire film. The T-rex features strongly again ( and this time there's two of them) along with a new and nasty little green dinosaur compsagnathus. The acting is'nt Oscar worthy or anything like it but the characters do have some charm and when they are put in danger you care what happens to them which is always a good sign. It does suffer a little from a bloated and anti climatic ending that is funny for about 2 minutes but I wont spoil it for you none the less. I give the Lost World its high rating because it does exactly what it sets out to do, entertain us. So I think its fair we overlook some of its flaws as with any kind of blockbuster sequel they are always there.",/review/rw0424127/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2001,jann-6,9," I like it
","I saw this in a theater in 1997 and I thought I liked it.  I just saw it again on DVD last night, and I now I know I do.  What I can't figure out is why so many people think it's so horrible.   After seeing JP III a few weeks ago, I still think The Lost World is better.  Of course the original is the best, but The Lost World is packed with suspense, witty dialogue (especially Goldblum's), and of course, the usual great looking dinosaurs.  There are a few things I don't like, the gymnastics routine towards the end being at the top of the list.  But other than that and a few silly lines, this movie is almost as thrilling as the first.  Personally, I don't care if the plot of this one is weak.  I've never even really given that any thought.  The first 100 minutes or so are loaded with excitement, then the finale with the T-Rex in the city is, if you ask me, played mostly for laughs. Yes it's like Godzilla, and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, but that's the point.  It's like those movies but with 21st century (almost) special effects.  And it's just plain fun to see this dinosaur stomping through the suburbs, drinking from a swimming pool and, wreaking havoc at gas station minimart.  I think if you don't take the San Diego scenes too seriously, and look at it as Spielberg's way of paying homage to *and* poking fun at the Godzilla-type movies, you can appreciate this portion of the movie. Then to wrap it all up with Bernard Shaw from CNN, and an obvious open door to a sequel - what more could you ask for?  Well, maybe a better plot as some people seem to be saying, but I think this is a great popcorn movie and it works for me.",/review/rw0424127/?ref_=tt_urv
