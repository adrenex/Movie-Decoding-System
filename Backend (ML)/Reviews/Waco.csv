3 August 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," Better than expected!
","For a B-grade film, this was surprisingly better than I expected. The acting was great by all cast members, the directing was on point, the writing was actually pretty good - without many plot issues one would normally expect, the cinematography perfect, the pacing was great, especially for the 107 min length, and the editing not too bad except for the flashbacks. My only critique was the terrible score, especially towards the last act. Had the score been more professional and consistent through out, the suspense would have been stellar instead of adequate. Overall an impressive film. A well deserved 8/10 from me.",/review/rw4458238/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2018,dave-mcclain,8," an expectedly good thriller
","""Bad Samaritan"" (R, 1:51) is a thriller directed by actor-turned-producer Dean Devlin (""Geostorm""), written by Brandon Boyce (""Wicker Park"") and starring television actor (and erstwhile Dr. Who) David Tennant. There's a bit of horror in here too, but this film is primarily an intricately plotted thrill ride.",/review/rw4458238/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2018,neener3707,7," Done Before, But Not Too Bad, A Little Extra On The Formula
","Over all not too shabby, definitely better than I expected. So yes its been done many times before, person (or in this case; people) break in to someones house for some ulterior motive, only to discover the home owner is either hiding something or is some sort of killer. But it throws a little extra into the formula, some works, the emphasis on the killer and his story was refreshing. But is it scary? Is it a horror movie? Because lately so called ""horror"" movies are indeed not scary at all. And as far as this film is concerned, I'm not sure what I want to say, because some of it was effective, and some of it wasn't. First of all, I like how they expanded on the typical story line they were telling, and without giving to much away, it creates this admittedly tense cat and mouse chaotic situation for all parties involved, so I liked how it just didn't stick 100% to the ""Rear Window"" and ""Disturbia"" formulas.",/review/rw4458238/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2018,valarik564,6," Decent, but with some glaring issues *some spoilers*
","The absolute best part of this movie was the acting from the main cast. Tenant, Condon, Sheehan, Byers, and Olivero were all great, and helped keep this movie from falling flat. For the most part, the writing was pretty good, if a bit cliched in some instances (Sean, the more-hero-than-antihero antihero, literally says ""Take me, take me instead""). The storyline didn't push the plot very far out of a reasonable realm of possibility, which made it that much more compelling. ",/review/rw4458238/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2018,krice23,9," Sold!
","Original script. Believable cast. They make it work easily & all in all it looks like what a thriller should look like! For once I'm not grumbling in disappointment over lack of continuity or missed opportunities.
Several layers thick with multidimensional characters that behave unexpectantly individual and unique instead of plotted. A pleasant surprise, indeed.
Perhaps I should have rated it a 9!?",/review/rw4458238/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2018,claudio_carvalho,8," Surprisingly Great Thriller
","In Portland, the amateurish photographer Sean Falco (Robert Sheehan) works with his best friend Derek Sandoval (Kerry Condon) as valet at a fancy restaurant. His girlfriend Riley Seabrook (Jacqueline Byers) studies in a university and he is estranged of his stepfather. Sean and Derek are also smalltime burglars, stealing the houses of the costumers while they are eating in the restaurant. One day, the obnoxious client Cale Erendreich (David Tennant) arrives at the restaurant driving a Maserati and Sean drives his car back to his house using the computer and Derek watches Cale in the restaurant. While snooping around the house, Sean finds a locked room and when he opens the door, he stumbles upon a woman tied to a chair with chains and gagged. He unsuccessfully tries to release her but he is forced to return to the restaurant with the Maserati. Sean decides to call the police, but Cale lures the police officers and turns SeanÂ´s life upside-down. ",/review/rw4458238/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2018,ThomasDrufke,7," Great B-Movie
","Bad Samaritan is a film that I simply did not know was even being released until I looked on Fandango and checked what movies I could go see yesterday. And besides David Tennant, there's really no big name here at all and there wasn't a single bit of marketing that I saw, so there's that. Really, Bad Samaritan will likely be a film that comes and goes and never knows that it existed. However, I actually thought it was a pretty well made film. Granted, it starts to fall apart after the hour mark, but if you're just looking for a cheap thrill with some fun performances, creepy imagery, and good time at the theater, then look no further than Bad Samaritan. The film has no place making some of the third act decisions it does however, it never fully jumps the proverbial shark, and it's always entertaining. ",/review/rw4458238/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2018,george.schmidt,7," Decent suspense thriller with one box of crazy turn by Tennant
","BAD SAMARITAN (2018) **1/2 David Tennant, Robert Sheehan, Jacqueline Byers, Lisa Brenner, Carlito Olivero, Kerry Condon, Rob Nagle, Hannah Barefoot. Decent suspense thriller with Sheehan's petty thief stumbling upon a victim-to-be of a serial killer when he attempts to rob the home and winds up in the crosshairs of an ultimate grudge match/cat-and-mouse with a few good jolts delivered and one box of crazy turn Tennant as the seriously f'd up creepazoid. Director Dean Devlin and Brandon Boyce's clever script combine for enough popcorn pleasing moments of meta-scream-at-the-screen scenes and even a few canny self-asides to aforementioned sequences.",/review/rw4458238/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2018,pinemaples,8," An unexpected thrill.
","I didn't expect much of a movie with a name like Bad Samaritan, I didn't expect to find something to enjoy about it besides David Tennant playing the villain, and I certainly didn't expect to find a great movie. The only real complaint I have is that the bad guy's backstory was dumb, and honestly would have been better off unexplained. I haven't seen a movie this consistently intense since The Infiltrator came out two years ago. I was especially impressed with the continuity and attention to detail, and MY GOSH can David Tennant pull off a fantastic American accent.",/review/rw4458238/?ref_=tt_urv

","Saw this movie on Amazon Prime. God, only because of the good reviews here i kept watching until the end. Jesus was this thing boring. At some parts beyond logical human behaivior. Who wrote this script? A twelve year old? I really despise lazy screenwriting where characters act far from any logic. Above all, the movie is BORING.

27 May 2020,Leofwine_draca,3," Thumbs down for this weak-written thriller
","BAD SAMARITAN is an astonishingly poor thriller in which a young man attempts to burgle a seemingly ordinary house only to discover something extraordinary inside. Yes, it's another version of THE COLLECTOR, a popular type of plot these days, but this is a film that goes down the dark thriller route rather than out-and-out horror. It's saddled with bad writing throughout, throwing in the cliches and weak characters and not giving the viewer much to enjoy otherwise. The villain's activities become increasingly preposterous as the running time progresses, and David Tennant is quite awful in the part, which doesn't bode well for his forthcoming turn as serial killer Dennis Nilsen. Thumbs down!",/review/rw4458238/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2019,bangel3322,6," Not Bad actually...
","This was actually better than I expected. I was expecting something close to Don't Breathe (which I hated) but this was more enjoyable. Like the little twist it took with the villain trying to ruin the protagonists life. I liked that. However the reason my low score is because I was left feeling a little cold by David Tennant's performance. He didn't portray the villain as I would have liked to have seen it done. Needed someone more menacing. Basically a better actor. Plus I would have liked just a little more background on the villain. I didn't find his reasonings for what he was doing convincing. Parts of the story were a little far fetched, but all in all, decent.",/review/rw4458238/?ref_=tt_urv

","'Bad Samaritan' is a movie that I've been looking forward to for a few months. Ever since David Tennant gave his incredible performance as Kilgrave on the Marvel Netflix series Jessica Jones. The idea of him playing a totally demented psychopath had me giddy with anticipation. However, when it comes to this film that's about where the fun ends. Even with David Tennant playing the big bad wolf, he stumbles too much to save 'Bad Samaritan' from being, well, a bad movie.",/review/rw4458238/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2018,stevendbeard,7," Nice little Thriller
","I saw ""Bad Samaritan"", starring David Tennant-Jessica Jones_tv, Doctor Who_tv; Robert Sheehan-Geostorm, The Mortal Instruments:City of Bones; Carlito Olivero-East Los High_tv, Blood Heist and Kerry Condon-Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri, Better Call Saul_tv.
This is a nice little thriller about a psycho serial killer. Robert and Carlito are two guys that work as valet parking attendants that are not on the up & up. They park your car and then steal anything they can find. Sometimes, they grab stuff left in the car and sometimes they go to the owners house and burglarize it-hey, they are eating and will be gone for an hour or so. Up comes David. Driving a fancy car and just being rather snotty to the guys. Robert decides to check out David's house and finds, among other things, Kerry, chained to a chair, with a gag in her mouth and signs of being beaten and tortured. What to do, what to do. Robert tries to set her loose but it is chains bolted to the floor. If he calls the police, he might risk getting in trouble for burglarizing the house-why was he in the house?-but he can't just leave her there at the mercy of David. Of course when the police do get involved, they don't find anything. That's when things turn into a game of cat & mouse, with David-the cat-messing around with Robert's-the mouse-life.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, language, drug use and some brief nudity and has a running time of 1 hour & 51 minutes.
I enjoyed it enough that I would probably buy it on DVD.",/review/rw4458238/?ref_=tt_urv
