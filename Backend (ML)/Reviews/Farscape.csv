","Now I am not usually a particular fan of Bill Nighy but in this he is very much at the top of his game. An adaptation of Kurosawa's ""Ikuru"" (1952), the setting is shifted to London where Nighy is the fastidious ""Mr. Williams"". A local civil servant heading up the public works department of the London County Council. His small team has some new blood in the form of ""Mr. Wakeling"" (Alex Sharp) whose baptism in the department is to accompany three ladies (and the audience) on a revelative journey through the pillar-to-post red tape that ""Williams"" himself facilitates - all guaranteeing that very little actually ever gets done! Leaving early one day, we discover that this erstwhile precise and predictable individual is seriously ill. Unable and/or unwilling to divulge this information to his son, he absconds to the seaside where he encounters ""Sutherland"" (Tom Burke) who gives him a relaxing tour of the local hotspots before he return to London and happens upon one of his team ""Miss Harris"" (Aimee Lou Wood). A posh luncheon ensues and the elderly gent and his young colleague start to bond. This bond soon has - unbeknown either of them - tongues wagging, but when she gets a new job he finds himself drawn to her. Drawn to her joie de vivre and general enthusiasm for a life he knows he will not have for too much longer. That becomes contagious as he decides to apply himself, and his team, to achieving at least one more thing in a professional capacity! It is a gently paced and evocative story that deals with that sense of re-prioritisation faced by anyone when faced with a profound change in circumstances. Nighy has a delightfully understated manner to his performance here, Wood is also effective as his increasingly valuable confidente and Oliver Hermanus manages to retain much of the charm and gently potent impetus of the original Ishiguro story. It is beautifully scored by Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch who incorporates original and powerful themes with established classical ones. The costumes and overall aesthetic of the film complements well the classy and impressive performances that resonated in quite a thought-provoking, and multi-layered fashion as I watched it. I was engaged by this from start to finish and I really quite enjoyed it.",/review/rw8665488/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2022,masonsaul,9," Incredible heartfelt drama
","Living succeeds with a basically impossible task of reinterpreting an Akira Kurosawa classic, resulting in an incredible drama that's both heartwarming and heartbreaking whilst being a poignant reminder not to let life pass you by and to take pleasure in the simple things.",/review/rw8665488/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2022,csm-78119,9," Exquisite
","From the opening footage of 1950s London to the closing credits this is a simply exquisite film. Bill Nighy is perfect in the lead role of the senior civil servant who is forced to confront his own mortality and Amy Lou Wood and Alex Sharp provide fine support at the other end of the age spectrum. There are some lovely scenes all played with understated panache and whilst the storyline is undoubtedly a little sad the film leaves the viewer appreciative of what's really important in life. It also achieves this in an understated, non preachy and gentle tone. There's also a fine soundtrack throughout and a lovely final scene to round it all off.",/review/rw8665488/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have a bit of a soft spot for movies set in the grey, emotionally repressed landscape of post-war Britain. I also happen to believe that Kazuo Ishiguro is one of our best living authors and Bill Nighy is always worth the price of admission. So I went into this preview of ""Living"" with high expectations and emerged happy that they had been met.",/review/rw8665488/?ref_=tt_urv

","I watched the trailer for this film, I was fascinated to see it was an English language remake of the 1952 Akira Kurosawa film Ikiru (""to live""), and I heard it was getting positive reviews, so I wasn't going to miss it. Basically, set in 1950s Britain, Peter Wakeling (Alex Sharp) is starting his new job at a bureaucratic office in London. The longest serving civil servant who has worked in the same monotonous position is the joyless Mr. Williams (Bill Nighy). At work, his office is full of bureaucratic inaction, including one case where a group of parents want a dilapidated neighbourhood cleared out and replaced by a children's playground. This document is passed through the various departments before ending back where it started, and it is just put in a pile. One day, Williams goes to hospital for a check-up, where Doctor Matthews (Jonathan Keeble) confirms that he has a tumour, which is cancerous and incurable, and he has only a few months left to live. Williams attempts to come to terms with having terminal cancer and with his impending death. He plans to tell his son about the cancer but decides against it when his son does not pay attention to him. He decides to distract himself with some of London's nightlife During the night, he meets eccentric filmmaker Sutherland (Tom Burke) who guides him. They go to a nightclub, where Williams requests a song from the piano player, and he breaks down whilst singing. His singing greatly affects those watching him. But after one night indulging in the nightlife, Williams realises this is not the solution. The following day, Williams encounters Margaret Harris (Aimee Lou Wood), a young female employee at his office who needs his signature to confirm her resignation. He takes comfort in observing her joyous love of life and enthusiasm and tries to spend as much time as possible with her. Williams takes her to a restaurant, and she admits she has nicknames for all the staff in the office, and her nickname for him is ""Mr. Zombie"". As time passes, Margaret becomes suspicious of his intentions and grows weary of him. After convincing her to join him for the last time, he tells her the truth about his health and asks for the secret to her love of life. Margaret is emotional and says that she does not know, but that she found happiness in her new job making toys and knowing that they will bring happiness to children. Inspired by her, Williams realises that it is not too late for him to do something significant. He decides he wants to make something, and through the city bureaucracy he remembers the lobbying for a playground. He surprises his colleagues returning to work after a long absence and begins pushing for the cite to be cleaned and for a playground to be built. He has concerns that he is intruding on the jurisdiction of other departments but is determined to get it finished before he dies. Sometime later, Williams dies, with his former co-workers gathering at his wake, following the opening of the playground, and try to figure out what caused such a dramatic change in his behaviour. His transformation from listless bureaucrat to passionate advocate puzzles them. As the co-workers drink, they slowly realise that Williams must have known he was dying, even when his son denied this, as he was unaware of his father's condition. They also hear from a witness that in the last few moments of his life, Williams sat on the playground swing at the park he built whilst it was snowing. The bureaucrats vow to live their lives with the same dedication and passion as he did. But back at work, they lack the courage of their newfound conviction. Also starring Adrian Rawlins as Middleton, Hubert Burton as Rusbridger, Oliver Chris as Hart, Michael Cochrane as Sir James, and Matilda Ziegler as Prim Lady. Nighy gives a credible performance as the old man with a stiff upper lip struggling to find a meaning and purpose for his life, after years in a joyless existence, there are many moving parts and a terrific score by Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch, it is an intimate story of mortality, self-reflection and redemption, it is overly melancholic and only slightly funny at times, I'm not sure if it is quite as great as the original film, but it is a most watchable drama. Very good!",/review/rw8665488/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,JimShops-1,10," Beautiful motion picture
","Just saw Living at the Telluride Film Festival and it is brilliantly made, beautiful, poignant, in short, a perfect film. Sad, yes, but marvelously uplifting with impeccable performances, directing, writing, production design, sets, cinematography, and score. Bill Nighy was pitch perfect as was Aimee Lou Wood and the entire cast. Absolutely loved it and was deeply moved. I have not seen the original Kurosawa version yet, but this is so well done it can't possibly disappoint. Kudos to everyone who made this new version. It's also an intriguing slice of life look at post-war British life. This film will give you hope and give you a new lease on life. A must see, but bring some Kleenex along.",/review/rw8665488/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2022,davidgee,9," A small life - a big impact
","This little gem of a movie is scripted (adapting a Japanese story) by Kashuo Ishiguro who gave us THE REMAINS OF THE DAY thirty years ago. Living is set in the 1950s. Mr. Williams (in those days men called each other ""Mister"" on the commuter train and in the office) manages a section of the planning offices at London's County Hall where shuffling papers seems to be the order of the day. A widower living with his buttoned-up son and bitchy daughter-in-law, Mr. Williams is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and decides to try and ""live a bit"" in the time he has left. A strip-club in Brighton turns out not to be his cup of tea, and he goes back to London and finds a small project to invest his time and energy in. He also befriends a girl working in a Lyons Corner House (Aimee Lou Wood) - an awkward platonic relationship that has echoes of Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson in THE REMAINS OF THE DAY.",/review/rw8665488/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2022,tobyp,10," Best film of 2022
","Not one for the Marvel generation perhaps, but this film oozes personality. Bill NIghy is ... well ... Bill Nighy, at his very, very best. You know how method actors try to inhabit their roles? Well, Bill I think brings his own personaility into every role and enhances it. The other characters are believable and sweet, especially gawky Aimee Lou Wood (Sex Education) and flawed (but we are never told how) Tom Burke (Musketeers, Strike). The music and screenplay are superb, down to the 1950's styled credits, the simplified colour palate of much of the film and the setting in London County Hall. Kazuo Ishiguro, take a bow. And perhaps a little credit for Leo Tolstoy too!",/review/rw8665488/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2022,Janetcolgate,9," Outstanding - a beautiful celebration of the ordinary
","I had no preconceptions or expectations when I went to see this film. I left the cinema feeling deeply moved, alongside a range of emotions including sadness and joy, amidst a sense that I had just been immersed in one of the best cinematic works of art in a very long time. In the jaded world of today's cinema where nothing is really new anymore, and movies peddle the Incredible, with disappointing over the top drama, this film's simplicity was its outstanding and defining feature. Accompanied by a haunting soundtrack, it tells the very human story of a man (Nighy) who has six months left to live and how he chooses to make his mark and get satisfaction from celebrating the ordinary and achieving a modest but much loved and celebrated goal. The performances were outstanding in their subtlety (who knew Nighy had such a beautiful singing voice), and the direction by Hermanus was perfect - designed to tell a simple story and get the best from the actors without being obtrusive or distracting. The setting in 1950s London, portraying a world of grey bureaucracy mirrors today's corporate, health, and social care world's perfectly, with the final message to embrace and accept that which ""doesn't quite fit"" sending a humorous yet pointed message to us all.",/review/rw8665488/?ref_=tt_urv

","It just might be the best BN performance we've seen! He truly shines in this poignant, carefully crafted, at times delicate, generally quietly unassuming, warm, and mesmerically engaging tale of life and its mundane patterns. The costumes and settings are wonderful to boot. With its focussed writing, the story is deftly kept in a frisson of frustration, heartache, warm humour, and the tension of the unspoken. All of the emotions and feelings are palpable. As for the story itself, it is believable and relatable - made more so by the great characters. I love films like this, that are pure artistry, as there aren't any elements left unconsidered, and it shows in the results.",/review/rw8665488/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,classicsoncall,10," ""If only to be alive like that for one day"".
","What a wonderful film! Even with an expected yet sudden death of a principal character, the story is more life affirming than tragic, though it's bound to have your eyes welling up from time to time. I admire what the filmmakers did here, reworking Akira Kurosawa's ""Ikuru"" at nearly two and a half hours by trimming it down to the essential story in a little over an hour and a half. It involves an elderly man in a bureaucratic position at a County Hall in England who learns he has cancer and is given between six and nine months to live. Seen at his job, Mr. Williams (Bill Nighy) and his staff are caught up in a routine pattern of shuffling paperwork to other departments, only to have much of their forms and letters return to the point of origin. It can be disheartening for those making legitimate requests, as in the case of three women who become determined to convert an unkempt and dangerous part of the city into a children's playground. After Williams learns of his condition, he tries to take a new approach to life with the little bit of time he has left, but after spending a night on the town with a new found acquaintance (Tom Burke), he finds it isn't enough, and becomes resolute in making thing happen at his job.",/review/rw8665488/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,ferguson-6,8," Nighy perfection
","Greetings again from the darkness. That uneasy feeling will likely never fade for me ... the anxiety when one of the classic movies of yesteryear gets a remake from a contemporary filmmaker with their own vision. Sometimes the new version is a respected tribute to the original, while other times, the director believes they can improve on the classic. In this case, director Oliver Hermanus and screenwriter Kazuo Ishiguro (THE REMAINS OF THE DAY, 1993) clearly have love for Akira Kurosawa's IKIRU (1952), one of the true classics of cinema. Moving the setting from Japan to 1953 England proves an easy transition thanks to a remarkable lead performance.",/review/rw8665488/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Living"" is a remake of Akira Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" (1952). Both films are situated in the 50's, but the remake translocates the action from Japan to England. This difference is smaller than it might seem at first sight, because the societies of both countries are characterized by terms as formality, tradition, hierarchy and introvert. By the way, the novel on which both films are based is written by Leo Tolstoi and tsarist Russia was another country notorious for its extensive bureaucracy.",/review/rw8665488/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2022,GB65,5," Sweet But Slow
","I think I maybe expected too much from this film, primarily because of the trailers and the official bumpf. Sadly, it did not live up to either billing. It is a sweet story about a bored/boring English Civil Servant bumbling through his life after 'recently' becoming widowed. After a terminal illness diagnosis we are led to believe his epiphany will lead to a rambunctious remainder of his days but this never materialises. The film undoubtedly picks up after the funeral scene and some of the characters display more depth but the film rarely uses this opportunity to pick up the pace and I felt we were left with a 'what could have been.'",/review/rw8665488/?ref_=tt_urv

We've seen this story done many times before, and this isn't the most unique of the bunch, but it is quite good. It may not reach the same heights as Akira Kurosawa's original film ""Ikiru"", but there is still lots of heart and care put into it, making this a worthwhile remake.",/review/rw8665488/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's a beautifully made film (on a budget) for sure but I found this remake of Kurosawa's Ikiru frustratingly inert. I am English and proudly somewhat reserved (until I've had a few drinks, thus living up to our other stereotype), but many of the characters in this are practically dead. Scenes drag a on too long, mostly because the characters don't converse properly, and while the poetry of it all held my attention I couldn't help but feel slightly agitated at the molasses pace.",/review/rw8665488/?ref_=tt_urv
