19 March 2019,emilymarshmallows,8," I have CF - here's my opinion
","I'm a 35 year old with CF. I was excited about this movie because any representation is potentially great. But I've seen other CF movies, seen it on TV, and it's usually terribly done. Incorrect nonsense, people are on o2 but climbing hills like it's no big deal, the severity isn't properly shown, etc.",/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv

15 March 2019,rgkarim,8," Five Feet Apart From Other Romance Dramas
","Teenage romance movies always hold special places in a lot of people's hearts, but depending on the decade your familiar with, the elements and presentation are a little different. Eighties brought comedy with emotional drama, nineties was the Nicholas Sparks beginning with the cute, cheesy tactics, early 2000s were all about the Nicholas Sparks, super dramatic stories that hold a lot of places in the hearts of the public. Then came the 2010s and the twist was now romance, but put some type of terminal illness with it to sweeten the deal... So tonight's movie continues this current trend, taking another story in hopes of invoking tears and pulling the heart strings of the audience at the same time. Yes, tonight is Five Feet Apart and yours truly is here to write his reviews as always and share his opinions. Let's go:",/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2019,SmashandNasty,7," The Fault in Our Stars Pt II
","Stella (Haley Lu Richardson) is a teenager that spends most of her time in the hospital as a cystic fibrosis patient. Her life is full of routines and she has got everything figured out until she meets Will (Cole Sprouse), another teen with the same terminal and chronic illness. Flirtation quickly turns into broken rules with potentially deadly consequences.",/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2019,bluesteele,8," Richardson and Sprouse Make This Work!
",I feel compelled to write this review for all of those guys who get dragged along to see some cheezy romance flick by the wife or girlfriend and can barely make it through without trying to duck into the adjacent theater for something action oriented.,/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2019,fatima_salamah,9," POOL Me In!! Pun Intended!
","My husband and I saw this last night, we are in our 30's, and both cried like babies all throughout the movie. I didn't even cry this much in the Notebook or PS I Love You or Me before you (and any other sad movie you can think of). I wanted to write a review because I hear a lot of comparisons to The Fault In Our Stars; yes both have sickly teenagers who fall in love but the stories are still completely different. Haley Lu Richardson's acting is amazing and blows it out of the park compared to Shailene Woodley...though not nice to compare as both are great stories in their own unique ways. Her portrayal of Stella was so natural and believable though. The rest of the actors were great too. Take tissues, eat candy, enjoy life and hug your loved ones. Go see this movie!",/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2019,ferguson-6,7," Rising star Haley Lu shines again
","Greetings again from the darkness. The all-too-familiar sick/dying teenager genre is frequently associated with Lifetime Channel movies or something of that ilk. What sets this one apart (and above) many in the slew of similarly themed movies is the script, and more so, two outstanding lead performances. Director Justin Baldoni is best known as an actor and director of TV projects, but he (mostly) handles the script from Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis quite well.",/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2019,tristanspohn,," My Heart Broke
",Not necessarily from the movie. There was a girl with Cystic Fibrosis in the crowd that completely lost it. The story hit way too home for her. Considering that I dont see how I couldn't give this a rave review.,/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2019,thabitalfadhli,8," it made me cry
",I loved this movie. The story is very beautiful. It gives you hope of life and takes it from you. the Romance in this film is beautiful. My eyes did not bleed because of a film a while ago,/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2020,UniqueParticle,9," Haley Lu Richardson is so beautiful and spectacular!
",I didn't know anything about CF but I sure love this film and everything around it! Many aspects are sad while being intriguing; I love films like this so much all the conversations are great and the romance is incredible. Very much deserves the 7.2 or higher!,/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2019,twisty-25251,10," Five Feet Apart, but close to my heart
","A wonderfully written story, played by such talented actors. The little details that make it just that little bit more intense. The right expressions that make it just that little bit more touching. The right words that make just that much of a difference. I held my breath through the whole movie, waiting for it to go wrong. I felt so immersed in the characters, and their stories. Their pain, their longing, their restrictions, they hit me right in the heart. And if that isn't a sign of a good, emotional movie, I don't know what is.",/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2019,neil-476,8," Engaging
","Stella is a bright, breezy 17-year old, in hospital for a regular ""tune up"", necessary as a cystic fibrosis patient. Fortunately, she is a keen blogger, and her blogs give us the main information we need to appreciate what follows - the prognosis that most sufferers die by the age of 30, and that sufferers should never get within 6 feet of each other for fear of infection. So when Stella encounters fellow CF patient (and wilful free spirit) Will, it is only a matter of time before they fall for each other. And they can't even kiss.",/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2020,Gordon-11,," Infuriating
","I find this film very infuriating, because all we see is some teenagers doing one irresponsible thing after another. And many scenes defy infection control measures, which is the underlying reason for being five feet apart - the whole premise of the film.",/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2021,kosmasp,6," Perspective and represantation
","I just read a review that is from a person that actually has CF. And it reads genuine, not like someone who craves attention or just plain lies about it. That person overall likes the movie and thinks the represantation and the mostly accurate depiction of certain things (therapy and so forth) weigh more than the fact that the movie goes Hollywood on us. Romantic drama Hollywood that is - apparently there are other movies that get a lot more wrong.",/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2019,pamn-76152,7," Heartbreaking
","It was heartbreaking. Call me whatever you like, but I like it when the story ends well. Other than that it was a good movie. Did anyone else notice the fact that there's a scene in the trailer that isn't in the movie? Like the picture of the movie on IMDb for example. That scene isn't in the movie and it's killing me cause it's obvious that Stella is doing better. Her hair is longer so it's a few months after the operation. I'm so confused.",/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2019,knicole123,9," We need these kinds of movies.
","This may not be a reboot, a squeal, a twisted thriller, a Comic Con front runner, or even your typical romcom. Definitely not your typical romcom.",/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2021,RosanaBotafogo,8," Cute and affecting...
","I watched it in 2019, I don't remember it because I didn't evaluate it, I found it super cute and exciting at the time, the scenes with the broomstick permeated my memory, exciting, painful theme, portrayed in a cute and youthful way, an unexpected and intense passion, many tears and aching hearts...",/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2019,vijaychandrank,7," Delivers what it promises.. Nothing more nothing less
","If you have watched the trailer you know how the story would unfold. Sick teens, fights at first, falls in love, does things to comfort each other, one lead saves the other with some tears and a hopeful ending. There would be no over the top moments or mind bending twists. This movie follows a template like I mentioned but its not boring. Haley lu is expressive and you feel for her. She has a complex to be organized and wants to live and expects other to follow the same. Cole sprouse is rigid at first but towards the climax, he has a powerful scene to redeem himself. Climax I feel was a bit stretched , could have been crisp if it was short. A decent directorial debut from justin baldoni. All in all a decent movie. Delivers what it promises.. Nothing more nothing less..!",/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv

16 March 2019,connorsparks-62925,10," Great date night movie!
","Wifes choice tonight and she picked this movie. It was great! We laughed, cried, and smiled all throughout the film. I'm always hesitant to watch these types of movies because of it feeling cheesy or forced but it didn't at all! Really enjoyed it.",/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2019,muamba_eats_toast,9," Heartbreaking romantic drama
","I went in expecting very little but found a fantastic, emotional heartbreaking drama that sets the tone and atmosphere perfectly throughout. There are a couple of moments that are over egged for dramatic effect especially towards the end with the ice. But other than that it was truly excellent and a refreshing surprise.",/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2019,martinriggs-28414,9," Better than I was expecting
",Does what it says on the tin and some more. Solid acting and I learned a lot more about CF which hopefully we all do. Probably the only person in the theatre that didn't cry though!,/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2019,QuirkyQueerGuy,4," Just as sappy and predictable as any one of these ""sick teens"" movies can get
","Based on the best-selling book by Rachael Lippincott with Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis, Five Feet Apart tells the story of Stella (Haley Lu Richardson) and Will (Cole Sprouse), two teenagers diagnosed with cystic fibrosis; in short, prone to difficult breathing and coughing up mucus due to lung infections, and aren't able to be within six feet of each other in danger of bacteria from one to infect another. They are treated at the Saint Grace hospital in an undisclosed location, and are monitored primarily by head nurse Barb (Kimberly Hebert Gregory). Stella is a vlogger who relies heavily on her ""clinical OCD"" to attend to the drug trial in which might extend her life. Will, however, has a devil may care attitude towards his sickness, often neglecting his regimen. They're practically opposites attract.",/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2021,blueoysterdvp,10," Great Emotional Movie
","Sure ""The Fault In Our Stars"" comes to mind when watching this. Heck they even use ""Wait"" by M83 which was also used in Fault and on their Original Soundtrack. ""Five Feet Apart"" is not a carbon copy of Fault by any means. Cole Sprouse, Haley Lu Richardson and Moises Arias do an outstanding job acting in Five Feet portraying CF patients . The supporting cast especially Kimberly Hebert Gregory as nurse Barbara did a great job as well. It is a movie so accuracy may be off at times for the drama. It works well though. Highly recommended. Give ""Five Feet Apart"" a chance. If you liked ""The Fault In Our Stars"" or similar movies you'll be glad you did.",/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2019,rockman182,5," Five Feet Apart (2019)
","I feel this time of year we usually get a teen romantic film. Last year we got Love, Simon around this time. That film was actually pretty solid. Had to kind of role my eyes at this when I saw the trailer but I ended up watching it to learn more about people with cystic fibrosis and how the disease effects their everyday functioning. I was into the first hour of this film but some of the character decision making and hammy romantic elements ruin the latter portion of a film. A film that is truly anchored by its Haley Lu Richardson's performance.",/review/rw4727185/?ref_=tt_urv
