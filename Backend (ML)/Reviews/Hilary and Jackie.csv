12 August 2021,pfne,9," For kids? Maybe.. excellent anyway? Definitely
","So I was sat at home, bored. My kid was off doing whatever it is kids do when they're in their rooms. I was lazily flicking through Disney+ and spotted this show. I thought,
""That'll do for the afternoon.""",/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2021,turner-bugzyblue-james94,10," I didn't expect a Disney show to be this good.
",I wasn't thinking a Disney Show could be this good. I love how it actually has a plot line and not just random episodes. The mystery is intriguing and makes me want to watch more. Definitely the best Disney channel show in years. I like the direction Disney is going and hope to get more shows like this in the future. More dark and mystery shows like this with an actual plot line please Disney!,/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2021,arod_85,7," Creepily cute
","I have a younger teen daughter and when she was a child we enjoyed watching Disney shows like ""Good Luck Charlie"", ""Shake It Up"", and ""Wizards of Waverly Place"". I always loved watching Disney with her because it brought back the nostalgia of my childhood watching The Famous Jett Jackson, Fastforward, and Even Stevens. However, we both agree that they don't make them like that anymore. Until Secrets of Sulpher Springs. It reminds me of those ""quality"" Disney shows we remember from back in the day where the story was family oriented but engaging across the age span. This show was creepy and mysterious enough to keep you interested, but not so scary to deter younger children. Even my 38 year-old husband got into the series and got annoyed when we watched an episode without him and Insisted we rewind it. The plot and acting were fairly good for a Disney show. Not likely to win any awards or make it to the big screen, but it's good for what it is. Surprisingly, the children's acting is far superior to the adults' acting. Hopefully there is a season 2 coming soon.",/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2021,cyberknight,8," Disney made a Twilight Zone episode into a series!
","If you are in doubt if you should or not watch this series, here's a quick check: if you like most of Disney Channel's series (shows like 'Whatever Place' and 'Whoever Montana'), then this series is probably not for you.",/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2021,bryanwilson-51031,10," Really good for all ages
","This seems out of place on Disney. I hope it doesn't get snatched to Disney+, but wow everyone in my household is waiting to see what happens next. The mystery and suspense is intense and they really set it up to continue to build. Not sure how long they can make it last, seasons wise, but man I'm ready for the next few episodes. Only downside of the show is waiting til next week. Louisiana as the background is beautiful and really add to the suspense. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed. It does have some ""scary"" scenes that had my daughter turning away but for the most part it's not a ""scary"" show but more of an edge of your seat mystery thriller! Can't wait until they start to reveal some of the mysteries!!",/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2021,crussum,10," Cant wait for the next episode!
","My kids made me watch this, so I wasn't expecting much from a Disney channel pilot. But we all are really excited for the next episode. From the storyline, to the acting, this show so far is better than anything they've ever put out. We were all on the edge of our seats waiting for what would happen next.",/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2021,ckr-71934,9," Kid's time travel
","Really liked. Especially because nothing was jumping out (like in Stranger Things). But it bothered me the characters were wearing sweaters in Louisiana in August. Have you ever been to the south in August? Nobody would be wearing a sweater! It's hot, muggy, and humid.",/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2021,Freezing_Walkers,5," Kindergarten version of Dark
","I guess it's ok for kids, but I felt no mystery or suspense in the series.",/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2022,greasygirlgoneclean,10," Awesome Family Show!
",Our kids are 9 & 12 and it's hard to find a show we can all agree on as a family and truly enjoy.,/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2021,dieseldog333,9," Wonderful new show
",I can't wait for season 2. Very well done. Good actors. Fun story but also tense and sometimes scary. It's actually quite an original storyline. It sucked me in and I couldn't stop watching. Such a cliffhanger at the end.,/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2021,peterDM-30380,10," That Clffhanger!
","Did anyone else audibly gasp at the final moment of the season! I can't wait for the next one. Great job, Disney!",/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2021,rannynm,10," Diving deep into the mysteries of the unknown!
","Disney's new TV series, Secrets of Sulphur Springs, dives deep into the mysteries of the unknown. The writers of the show weave a chilling tale of mystery and suspense that is brought to life by the cast. It is a show about new friendships and old secrets that will leave you on the edge of your seat, as it did me.",/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2021,jaltschuler,7," Is it just me or is this a Disney version of Dark?
",Don't want to spoil anything but there are so many similarities in the plot that it can't be a coincidence.,/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2021,vcaja06,10," We love it
",My daughter (9yrs) and I happen to be flipping through to find something north of us could watch together and she saw this. We turned it on and wound up watching all 4 episodes in one day. The story is entertaining and mysterious. The acting is great. We can't wait to see the next episode.,/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2022,lheethuis,10," My 9 ur old daughter n I love it

30 January 2022,ChanithaWeerasinghe,10," Fantastic, dramatic, mysterious and bingeable.
","Secrets Of Sulphur Springs is the best Disney Channel show I've ever seen. With an exciting story involving a mystery with ghosts and time travelling, this is show is remarkable and easily makes everyone to binge-watch it.",/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2021,twodiamonds,9," one big failing
",I'm really enjoying the series except for one thing. each show has only about 18 minutes of new content. it starts with about three minutes of what happened last week and intro to the series and ends with about two minutes of credits. not enough meat per show. but still am enjoying,/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2022,letsorpheas,10," The Best Disney Channel Series!
",Secrets of Sulphur Springs is the best Disney Channel series I have ever seen! It's mysterious and I love that time-travel thing! The cast plays very well and the script is awesome! I am waiting for a season 3 at 2023!,/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2021,deloudelouvain,5," I guess for kids it's okay.
","To be honest, after reading all the positive reviews, I was expecting something really good but that's just not the case. I admit there's some mystery that keeps you mildly interested but that's about it. I think I watched nine episodes, had to wait too long for the next one and so I forgot about the story and wasn't interested by it anymore. The kids are annoying to watch. I get it that it's Disney and I guess younger people will find this very entertaining, but in my case I'm just way too old for this kind of series.",/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2021,msudoll,10," This Show Surprised Me
","I love anything time travel. So, I decided to give this a try. It exceeded my expectations. I flew through the season in one day. My 11 year old son started to get interested as did my husband. We had to know how it ended since there were lots of twists and turns. I love that it isn't corny and over the top like some shows on the Disney channel. Adults can watch this without cringing. Great writing and acting! Hoping for a season 2!",/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2021,markawyman,10," AMAZING!!
","I just started watching it and I LOVE IT... Anything to do with time travel is right up my alley... Although it is off course for Disney, I hope it continues and more shows like it are made.",/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2021,cecytapia,10," Love it!!!
","We need more of this kind of series. Suspense shows are usually for adult shows, but this is a healthy way to also provide it to middle school kids.
I really like the interactions and communication the children (main characters) have between each other. Models a good example for our kids today. Disney did it again ðŸ˜€",/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2021,smcar,10," Excellent mystery
",This is the best show that the Disney Channel has put out in ages! Not too scary for children and interesting enough for adults. Love it,/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2021,victoriaaida,8," Entertaining
","It's very familiar to the Dark's plot but way more relaxed vibe though, less stressful and actually interesting.",/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2021,neuroepidr,10," Intriguing. Amazing. You will watch every episode!
",I watched the first episode after dinner tonight. It was so intriguing. Every moment. Then onto the next episode. Ok so now I have watched the entire season of episodes 1-9 on Disney Plus in 3.5 hours. I really cannot wait to see episode 10 and more. I just want to keep watching. It is worth it. I might watch the entire series tonight. Seriously.,/review/rw6758633/?ref_=tt_urv
