5 January 2019,AlsExGal,5," The whole movie felt loud and relentless and so long
","There was embarrassing writing, embarrassing acting, and listening to Amber Heard trying to deliver this terrible dialogue with zero inflection was exhausting. Why does half of the population of Atlantis sound like they're from California? The dialogue was never more than cliche with a predictable plot. The ""advanced ancient civilization hidden away from the world"" trope is already old. There was so much CGI that none of the action ever felt impressive or tense or real. Any time someone said ""Ocean Master"" with a straight face I wanted to laugh.",/review/rw4547407/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2020,grantss,4," Your usual style-over-substance comic book movie
","Your usual style-over-substance comic book movie. Flimsy plot, really just a vehicle to move you from one action scene to another. Formulaic and cliched: change the characters and settings and you've got pretty much the story of every comic book superhero. Good CGI, but that's a given nowadays.",/review/rw4547407/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2019,rayres0708,1," DC needs to get their sh** together.
","There are so many things wrong with this movie. The acting is mediocre. The script feels like it was written by a 12-year-old boy. The CGI is inexcusably cheesy. The plot is not compelling. The jokes aren't funny. They kept explaining things that I don't care about. Ocean Master. Trident of Atlan. Robots in ancient Atlantis. Blah, blah, blah. So. Much. Exposition.
I have hated the last several DC films, Wonder Woman being the least terrible. This one is officially the worst. If you want something about Atlantis, the Disney one was way better.",/review/rw4547407/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2019,God_is_with_us,1," SO disappointed, and was really excited when I saw the trailer
","I thought the movie would be at least decent, given the publicity that the film made $1 billion. When I watched the film, it appeared to be too fake. The conversation dynamic was so unnatural and unrealistic, the movements. Just everything about the film. So disappointed.",/review/rw4547407/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2019,Sandra-durand80,1," Not as good as I expected
","Boring movie. It surprises me because there were some great actors, but there was some terrible actors too. A lot of unnecessary scenes in my opinion. I was so bored! I feel like the plot was all over the place.",/review/rw4547407/?ref_=tt_urv

24 March 2019,silvermistvio,1," One of the most boring films I've ever seen.
","Totally boring. I started watching it two months ago and for some reason I was busy for a while, so, I stopped watching it. To this day, I don't even want to watch and also, I don't remember to continue to watch it.",/review/rw4547407/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2019,siderite,5," I thought Disney bought Marvel, not DC
","There is no reason that I know for why Aquaman turned into the modern CGI version of The Little Mermaid, liberally mixed with Aladdin and The Lion King. I mean, yeah, Black Panther was mostly Lion King, but it was interesting and fun and the world building was not bad. Aquaman feels cartoonish from the start to the very end. The pointless CGI, Heard's horrible wig, all the fairy tale characters that seek to show us how they are superior to people on the surface who have grown up reading about single dimensional characters like them, the predictability that one can find in children stories only. To be honest, the feeling I have most about this film is outrage. It is condescending and dumb. It's the Hollywood version of Homer telling Bart he's stupid.",/review/rw4547407/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2019,borismk-38942,4," The most overrated generic superhero film you'll ever see
","I don't know where the hype for this film comes from, because it can't be from the content. The dialogue and characters in this movie are often ridiculous in the least entertaining way possible. Silly can be entertaining, but it can also just feel stupid. The female characters only seem to exist to be Aquaman's conscience (because he can't think for himself, as he's boring), they have no flaws or vices (in other words no depth). The villain is a cheap charicature of the warmonger, with a few poorly expressed environmental ideas thrown into his perspective. The good points of this film fall mostly on the visuals. It is a stunning film in terms of the undersea beauty portrayed, a literal riot of colour across the screen. I would also say that action is pretty positive, the combat is intense and epic. Overral though, I wouldn't reccomend",/review/rw4547407/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2019,gogoschka-1,," Everything But The Kitchen Sink
","Everything I saw, read and heard about 'Aquaman' before it came out had me convinced it wouldn't be my cup of tea. My impression was that this would be yet another bloated studio tentpole with cheesy dialog, a generic story and artificial looking CGI. However, once it opened, a passionate film fan I respect a lot started spreading so much obviously genuine enthusiasm for the movie that I eventually got over myself and watched it.",/review/rw4547407/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2019,alex-278,1," Why is this happening?
","To be fair I was watched this film in a group and would not have gone by myself.
But what absolute nonsense. If it was not written by a child it was certainly meant for a child. It is just hours of unadulterated CGI that tires and numbs your mind.",/review/rw4547407/?ref_=tt_urv

17 April 2019,nikkilynn487,1," Worst movie ever!!!
","Don't bother with this movie! The story is garbage, the acting is terrible (how is Jason Momoa famous?) and the action scenes endlessly drag on. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. Maybe even negative stars. Save ur money, save ur time, save ur eyes this is a complete waste of money. I literally walked out on this. You'd have to pay me $10 million to even finish it. Please no f'n sequel!!!",/review/rw4547407/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2022,SPZMaxinema,8," Good! One of the better DC movies!
",I remember seeing this in theaters with someone else and we both really liked it! I thought the action scenes (especially the ones with Black Manta) were very neat and I also loved a lot of the underwater sequences with how they did the effects. It was an impressive cast and I liked the story arch of Aqua-Man's human father and the dock and also thought that the villain acted well too. And say what you want about Amber Heard but I liked her in the movie too! Pretty entertaining!,/review/rw4547407/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2018,McLovin4420,2," Every superhero movie cliche you can imagine
","I have no idea why somebody would give this movie a good score, let alone 10. After 20 minutes I have decided that its for the best to switch my brain off and enjoy the show. But damn this movie is way too dumb. Character development is rushed and is given in a form of cringy and weak dialogues. Jokes feel like they are just out of place, but specific moments are created just for them to happen (which makes it even more ridiculous). There are some really stunning shots, but its more of an exception rather than the rule.
But the main issue, which makes this movie unwatchable without at least 4 cans of beer, is the fact that its linear as hell, there are 0 unpredictable plot twists, from the beginning of the movie (or even from trailers) you for sure know how its going to end.
Also the mood is unbelievably inconsistent, at some points characters are dead serious, while in 2 minutes they may be cracking jokes. Its not as bad as in Justice League, but black manta just looks pathetic with his constanty frowny or angry face.
WB, u evil corporate idiots, stop ruining your movies by trying to be like Marvel and making movies based on a formula which clearly doesn't work. It just looks like a parody and not a well done one.",/review/rw4547407/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2019,claudio_carvalho,8," A Great Adventure
","""Aquaman"" is a great adventure of Marvel, with Jason Momoa in the lead role and directed by James Wan. The film works and is supported by great cast and special effects. James Wan shifts from horror genre and makes a good adventure film. Names such as Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman and Dolph Lundgren support this great production with the gorgeous Amber Heard. Looking forward for the sequel. My vote is eight.",/review/rw4547407/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2018,shopping-277-112148,6," Is it just me?
","What's with the 10 out of 10 reviews? really?. Sure it's probably the best (or second best) DC Justice league era, but that's not difficult.
Like all the other offerings, it's overblown, wooden, one dimensional and over reliant on over the top CGI.
As a child I was always a DC fan and I want them more than anything to bring this thing together, but Marvel have certainly laid down a tough marker for how it should be and DC still haven't met that challenge.
The main thing missing from the film is charm and simplicity, sure Momoa just about saves the day and I think he can develop Aquaman into a loved character, and the film is a step in the right direction. But 10 out of 10 it most certainly isn't.",/review/rw4547407/?ref_=tt_urv

","As usual, DC seems to be moving towards marvel which is so sad. I am a fan of action and fantasy movies, not caring whether it Marvel or DC or a smaller studio. The movie is very cliched and you quickly get bored to see what's to come next after the first act. And oh please, the music used is really bad plus the visuals are cheesy.
