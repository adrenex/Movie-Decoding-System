10 May 2019,UniqueParticle,6," Mediocre & messy
","I first saw this a month ago, while really tired. Now I'm watching a 2nd time with a much clearer head realizing it's a decent movie to watch. Not much funny and a lot of ridiculousness. Jennifer Lopez's character isn't very easy to stay with things with the boyfriend. That was disorienting, but it's a sweet romance despite its many flaws. Only recommend seeing this once and don't pay for it maybe just watch it on Showtime like I did.",/review/rw2390545/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2010,montera_iulian,5," Same Bullshack Different Production...
","After seeing the disappointing ""Bounty Hunter"" I went to see this movie with a little hope. I was wrong because this movie failed also. The story is actually in 99% of the cases impossible to happen in real life simply because there's no man out there that will be able to raise someone's babies after just one week of relationship. Second the acting was sub-mediocre. A large amount of over acting and such a clicheic story full of scenes that we saw over and over and over again in so many movies about girl meeting boy or boy meeting girl.",/review/rw2390545/?ref_=tt_urv

","(Synopsis) Zoe (Jennifer Lopez) has decided that she has waited long enough looking for Mr. Right to come along before she becomes a mother. Her clock is ticking, and time is running out for her, so Zoe makes an appointment with the doctor to become pregnant without a man. Within hours of the procedure, Zoe meets Stan (Alex O'Loughlin) an attractive and charming man who has caught her eye. Soon a budding relationship between them becomes a full blown courtship. Then Zoe finds out that she is pregnant after only one try at the doctor's office. She must find a way to tell Stan that she is pregnant without his walking out of her life. Stan is not sure at first, but he fully commits to Zoe and says that he is in. As the pregnancy comes nearer to the birth, both of them are unsure about the future and their relationship.",/review/rw2390545/?ref_=tt_urv

23 April 2010,TheWhiteCallaLily,3," Awful in so many ways
","The plot is fresh and original, at least I've never seen anything like it before. This film actually has two options. #1 To be a serious drama about a ""middle aged"" woman and the choices she makes. #2 To be hilarious and make the audience laugh all the way home. Somehow this movie is attempting both which unfortunately results in a chick flick so weak that not even the girliest of girls (that would be me), would bother watching.. again. It has a few good scenes here and there, but not enough to make it worth watching a second time. Being quite the J.Lo fan, this movie really was a major disappointment, as I had looked forward to her comeback. I def smell a Razzie...!",/review/rw2390545/?ref_=tt_urv

10 September 2010,michaelRokeefe,6," Even the best plans need back-up.
","Very nice romantic comedy with Jennifer Lopez in the right role for a change. Lopez plays florist Zoe, who's biological clock is pounding and decides with her bad luck with men to go ahead with artificial insemination. By chance, that very same day she meets the man of her dreams; Stan(Alex O'Loughlin) is a farmer and cheese maker. For both it is love at first sight, but when Zoe is told she is definitely pregnant the whirlwind romance seems to get real rocky. Confusion and romantic slapstick keeps this film lively and interesting. My favorite scene involves a water hose. The voluptuous Lopez proves she can carry a movie. Supporting cast includes: Robert Klein, Linda Lavin, Michaela Watkins and Tom Bosley.",/review/rw2390545/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2010,Jackpollins,1," I should have made up a back up plan instead of seeing this garbage
","Still having the terrible taste of Leap Year, The Bounty Hunter, and Did You Hear About The Morgans in my mouth, I walked into The Back Up Plan wondering what I was doing there. I then walked out of The Back Up Plan wondering what I was doing there. The best thing that can be said for this film is at least there's a Jennifer without the last name Aniston starring in it. Anthony Anderson has a welcome cameo as a playground dad, and Alex O'Loughlin as Zoe (Jennifer Lopez)'s love interest, Stan is good, but what can they really do with this forced, unfunny material? There's one scene in particular that stood out to me as an example of how bad this film is. That scene is a scene in which a woman, not Zoe was giving birth. The joke is that the birth plays more like an exorcism. That's a funny premise for a joke, but they take it way too far to the point where my stomach churned. Also, Zoe takes every word Stan says as a sign that he's leaving her. He never does leave her, but I would have if I were him, because Zoe was just so unpleasant. I found The Back Up Plan to be less a movie and more a brainless sitcom that only made it to the length of 5 episodes. Yes, 5 sitcom episodes is a total of 110 minutes, so this is another romantic comedy that runs way longer than it should have. Please, for the good of mankind, skip this garbage, and rent a good romantic comedy like Better Off Dead, The Sure Thing, or When Harry Met Sally.",/review/rw2390545/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2010,Thistle-3,6," Back-Up Plan Fail
","I really wanted to like it. I talked to Alex O'Loughlin about the movie over a year ago, I think. And, this was Jennifer Lopez' big return to film, after a 5 year absence. Both of their characters in The Back-Up Plan are very likable. She is a successful businesswoman who has decided she's done waiting for Mr. Right and a family. She goes ahead and gets inseminated. That day, she bumps into Stan, a gorgeous funny guy who has his own farm (note the cheese, above) and dreams of owning a sustainable food shop. He pursues her, she resists. All sorts of clumsy, weird things happen along the way. Honestly, these characters and their relationship is really interesting. It's all the other junk the filmmakers put into play that I found distracting and distasteful and unbelievable. For instance, Zoe has an upscale pet store with a couple of interesting employees who have realistic questions about her and for her, but we barely see them. Instead, we're subjected to a strange single mother's group that is stereotypical and offensive. It's like the writer and director are trying to straddle a line between a sweet rom-com, like Sweet Home Alabama, and something more crude, like Knocked Up. There were so many likable and believable story threads that were just dropped, in favor of the gross out scene or something silly that just didn't make sense for the characters. I didn't hate it, because I liked the leads, I was just really disappointed and not satisfied. I give The Back-Up Plan a 6 out of 10.",/review/rw2390545/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2010,editor-530,1," Back Away from this Plan
","Jennifer Lopez as Zoe is a beautiful and talented woman who slummed in this movie. The film had a disconcerting incongruity to it from the beginning to the end. The opening title sequence is an animation reminiscent of a 1960's movie. The cartoon of Lopez sees all kinds of things in New York that reminds her of having a baby. The animation segues to the live action of her being artificially inseminated. We discover later in the movie that she made that choice because she had no family since her mother died when she was a child and her father abandoned her, leaving her grandmother (played by Linda Lavin of the Alice TV series) to raise her. And she did not have much longer to live.",/review/rw2390545/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2010,viamber,1," The Real Back Up Plan? Plan to Stay as Far Away as Possible!
","I was really looking forward to this movie. My friend, Carlease, is in it and the promos looked funny. I knew I was in trouble, meaning I was NOT going to laugh very much, after the intro scene between the two main characters JLo and Stan. The whole cab thing...excuse me? You have at least 5 other cabs driving around behind them and they couldn't each simply flag another one down? Or at least make a comment about it? I found it rude that she scarfs down all the muffin samples and when the Muffin Lady calls her on her stuff, she DOESN'T even buy one? Just walks away? Rude!",/review/rw2390545/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2021,Nathan4,8," Pleasantly surprised!
","Yes, it's a RomCom and therefore is also cheesy and predictable. But they really nailed the COMEDY part in this one - I was not expecting that! We laughed out loud A LOT. And that's even with them wildly underutilizing Melissa McCarthy. Didn't watch it for the first time until now, more than a decade after it was released, but I can tell you that I won't wait another decade before watching it again! As a guy, there are only a handful of RomComs that I would want to watch more than once, so the fact that this made it on the list is high praise.",/review/rw2390545/?ref_=tt_urv

23 April 2010,WHYeat,3," Total Chick Flick
","The Back-Up Plan starts with a desperate girl named Zoe, who wants  nothing more than to meet the man of her dreams and have a family.  Mostly, the bit about the family. But having dated for years with no  results she decides to take matters into her own hands and gets  artificially inseminated by CRM-1014. On that very day, along comes the  man of her dreams, Stan. A cheese selling farmer. He's good looking,  charming, and after learning that Zoe is pregnant, is willing to help  her raise this kid who isn't his. They have 9 months to date, fall in  love and have a baby. Her clock is ticking like no other.  So. Having watched the preview and against your better instinct you are  now considering whether to watch The Back-Up Plan. And you ask, ""Is  this movie as cheesy as the cheese Stan sells for a living?"" Let's  start with the not-so-great. On their first date, Stan accidentally  spills wine on Zoe while going in for their first kiss. Apparently the  wine they have is 50% alcohol because their candle-lit dinner in the  garden turns into a fire. In an attempt to put the fire out, Zoe  inadvertently sprays Stan down with a hose and a water fight ensues.  This is not the first chick flick I've seen with a playful water fight.  Actually, Remember Me had one as well. I just don't understand the  appeal or the entertainment value. In another scene, Zoe and Stan are  standing in front of a kiddie pool with a fully dilated mother  screaming her lungs out in an exorcism-like fashion. Not only does Zoe  belly flop into the pool, but Stan gets a nice Shamoo-sized splash in  his fear-stricken face. Disgusting? A little. Funny? A little. Before  women start chastising me - I just want to state that having children  is a beautiful thing and can be very painful. Women everywhere have my  utmost respect for going through what they do to bear and raise  children. But how may times has a movie exaggerated the insanity of  giving birth? From a movie-goer's perspective this has been played out.  I could say the same about a lot of the other jokes. The humor was on  the lower end of the scale for me. The best laugh I got was the  gynecologist repeating, ""Vagina. Vagina. Vagina."" in order to calm Stan  down during a visit.  What about the good? What if there something deeper to this shallow  comedy that masquerades as entertainment? Perhaps The Back-Up Plan  serves as a litmus test for the acceptance of artificial insemination  in today's modern world. Must the modern woman live life at the speed  of light and battle the pressures and expectations of marriage and of  having children? Perhaps The Back-Up Plan shows that a true man  perseveres and stands by his woman through thick and thin and babies -  and a real man should. Well, then I'd have to retract all my criticism  and atone by watching it once again with open eyes and a new  perspective. Or maybe this is yet another failed attempt at cheap  entertainment because with a $12 price tag, it might be a bit  overpriced.  Well, if you can first suspend your disbelief that a man is able to  fully commit to a woman pregnant with someone else's baby after just 2  dates. Then, if you wade through all the failed comedy bits and the  cliché romance, then maybe we can talk a bit about the good. Perhaps  Zoe isn't trying to be a single mom because she can't meet the right  guy. Maybe the reason is deeper and is paralleled by her grandmother  who has been engaged for the past 22 years. Maybe I'm giving this movie  too much credit. But what I do know is that there were at least a dozen  people in the theater and there were quite a few good laughs in the  audience. This movie is entertaining - to some. So if you're on the  fence about The Back-Up Plan, I say just do it. I hope those that  decide to watch it against my recommendations enjoy it. As for me, I'd  rather watch Knocked Up again.",/review/rw2390545/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2010,inkblot11,8," The most modern of romances, that's certain, and a touching, genuine one at that, I loved it!
","Zoe (Jennifer Lopez) is finally getting her life in order. She left a lucrative, high-profile job to open a Manhattan pet store and she lives in a nice apartment with her disabled but darling Boston terrier. Now, she is pursuing another important item on her ""bucket list"". She is going to have a child, if possible. Having not yet the man of her dreams, she is using her ""back-up plan"", which is artificial insemination. After leaving the nice ob-gyn's (Robert Klein) office, Zoe is floating on air, despite the rain, and hails a cab. But, as she hops in one side, a good-looking man, Stan (Alex O'Loughlin) gets in on the other. After a brief argument, Zoe concedes the taxi to Stan, wanting nothing to diminish her present joy. But, Stan gets out, too, and the cab speeds away. Now, they are both out in the elements and they head in different directions. However, a few days later, Zoe and a close friend are visiting a farmer's market when, remarkably, Stan is there selling his homemade goat cheeses. This time, he gets her digits and, on their first date, Stan plans an elegant, private picnic at a lovely community garden. Nice! Zoe is smitten in no time and Stan appears to be as well. But, naturally, the back up plan did indeed work and Zoe is pregnant. How will she be able to tell Stan and what will his reaction be? Nana (Linda Lavin) and her fiancé (Tom Bosley) think things will work out. Will they? This is a very touching and sincere film that could be described as the ultimate modern romance. Modern technology has changed the landscape of family planning and so has the women's movement. But, no matter what history brings, true love remains true and it is the same here. As the couple, the beautiful Lopez and the handsome O'Loughlin are very fine indeed. Their journey is not a smooth road but a bumpy drive and the twosome is up to the challenges their difficult roles bring. All of the supporting actors are quite nice, too, especially the members of the new age ""single mothers"" group who embrace Zoe's plan. The settings are most lovely, from Manhattan to a goat farm up north and the costumes, script, direction and film making techniques are very worthy. Most importantly, the story has a ring of truth that can not be denied, making it anything but ""fluff"". In short, if you love romantic comedy, you won't need a back-up plan this week. Make a view of this film your one and only choice and you will not be disappointed.",/review/rw2390545/?ref_=tt_urv

","First off I love J Lo, but she makes bad choices about some of her movies. After a 5 year absence I was hoping for something great like ""Monster In Law"" unfortunately this is not it. J Lo is getting a bit old to be playing the hapless unwed single girl, now at 40 she needs something meaty to sink her teeth into. A serious drama that is not another thrown together love story that just does not work. If you want to see this wait for the DVD but don't waste your money at the theater, you'll be kicking yourself. Now I hear J Lo is the lead in the remake of 1987's Overboard which starred Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, which bombed at the box office. Hopefull the producers and writers will come up with a remake that will be GOOD J Lo cannot afford another box office failure.",/review/rw2390545/?ref_=tt_urv

","Jennifer Lopez stars in yet another one of her sappy, romantic comedies as a love lorn woman desperate for true love. She's a successful business woman who becomes pregnant with twins through artificial insemination. Of course, none of this would make any sense if she didn't meet the man of her dreams (Alex O'Laughlin) who practically falls head over heels after their first encounter. After a wild night of passion, Zoe admits that she has not one, but two buns in the oven and despite the big surprise, Stan decides to pursue a relationship with her anyway. Really????! Overall, Stan and Zoe deal with a few bumps in the road, followed by major insecurities, especially Zoe due to her lack of trust and inability to develop a close connection with anyone. Now let's be serious, There is absolutely nothing new or surprising about this movie. It's your usual boy meets girl storyline which reminds you of how impossible it is to take something that's far from mediocre so seriously. ""The Back-up Plan"" is a decent movie to watch if you can't help shutting your brain off for more than 45 minutes.",/review/rw2390545/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2011,GLanoue,1," Danger: emotionally retarded narcissists at work
","People call this a chick-flick, but my wife saw it with me and she was just as disappointed as I was. I hate this kind of cynically made flick that adds to the dumbing down of popular culture: 40 somethings acting like late 20 somethings with the emotional, psychological and social awareness of 15 year-olds. In other words, everyone here is selfish, self-centered, narcissistic, and just plain stupid. I understand the concept of suspension of belief, but that's supposed to refer to situations, not characterisation. I am not sure who is responsible for this mess, but the principal blame should lie on Jennifer Lopez' shoulders. This is clearly a vehicle for her, a kind of Sex in the City dumbed down even lower than the standards of SitC (and that bar was already pretty low), without the references to anal and oral sex and set in hipper Tribeca. The premise that leads to pregnancy is unbelievable, as is the fact that no one seems to work seriously or think about it too much yet live very comfortably in New York, while Stan (the love interest who is -SPOILER- swept off his feet by his chance encounter with J-Lo) runs what looks like a toy farm miraculously producing goat cheese by the ton, with nary an animal in sight except for what look like gorgeous thoroughbreds. Never mind. The whole thing is cheesy (sorry; couldn't resist), and even its principal subject, pregnancy and birth, is treated in a ridiculous and mean-spirited way. I mean, J-Lo wants so desperately to get preggers and then gets in crisis mode when she can no longer fit into Lindsay-Lohan tight dresses to show off her major southern asset? A loony lesbian who poos while giving birth in a plastic pool while her support group chants and drums ridiculous new age crap?
